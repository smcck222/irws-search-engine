<F P=106> ["Roundup": "China To Invest Heavily in Major </F>
Communications, Construction Projects"] 
  [Text] Beijing, January 30 (XINHUA) -- Although China has 
repeatedly stressed that this year's scale of public investment 
in fixed assets should be brought under strict control, priority 
will still be given to the capital construction of transport and 
telecommunications systems. 
  Statistics from related departments show that this year the 
state will continue to inject a large amount of funds in key 
transport and telecommunications construction projects. 
  The planned infrastructure construction budget for the 
Ministries of Railways, Communications, Posts and 
Telecommunications and Civil Aviation Administration of China 
(CAAC) have all risen by a large margin, compared with the sum 
applied in 1993. 
  While last year the Ministry of Railways made use of an 
infrastructure investment of 22.5 billion yuan, this year the 
state has ratified a huge sum of 41.7 billion yuan; and while 
the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications applied an 
investment of 40 billion yuan in fixed assets last year, this 
year the planned budget has risen abruptly to 53.6 billion yuan. 
  Transport and Telecommunications have long been 
"bottlenecks" 
restricting China's economic development. With the constant and 
high-speed development of the country's economy in the past few 
years and the implementation of a market economy system, the 
problem has become increasingly serious. 
  To remove the "bottlenecks", Chinese leaders have put 
infrastructure construction in these fields under special 
protection and drafted a series of preferential policies for 
project approval, supply of funds, personnel allocation and some 
other aspects. Among the state's 210 key capital construction 
or technological remolding projects for the period between 1993 
and 2000, which must introduce technologies and equipment from 
overseas, 52 are distributed throughout the Ministries of 
Railways, Communications, Posts and Telecommunications and CAAC, 
nearly one fourth of the total. 
  Last year construction on a large number of key projects in 
these fields was started, including more than a dozen 
long-distance optical telecommunications cables, 10 railway 
construction projects, and expansion or building of a large 
number of airports, high-grade highways and deep-water berths. 
The majority of these construction projects have entered the 
phase requiring the most extensive funding. 
  Sources from the Ministry of Railways said that this year 
tracks will be laid on 2,100 km of new lines and more than 1,300 
km of multiple-track lines, and over 190 km of railway lines 
will be electrified. Some 19.6 billion yuan will be put into 
seven key construction projects. One of them, the 
Beijing-Kowloon Railway, will be 80-90 percent complete by 
year's end. 
  Last year the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications laid 
eight long-distance optical cables, and this year construction 
on four cables will be continued, and two will be remolded and 
nine newly constructed. This year's plan also includes nine 
million new telephone subscribers, an increase of 300,000 
long-distance lines, 900,000 long-distance lines in 
program-controlled exchanges, and 12 million urban exchange 
lines. In addition, mobile telecommunications will also develop 
significantly. 
  By the end of 1993 China had opened 1.07 million km of 
highways, of which 1,145 km are expressways. This year the 
Ministry of Communications plans to construct 18,000 km of 
highways, including 960 km of high-grade routes especially for 
automobiles. 
  To meet the speedily increasing demand for passenger and 
cargo transport, CAAC will continue to expand or construct 
airports and other related facilities, while adopting measures 
to reinforce air safety. 
  Last year CAAC received 71 new passenger planes of all 
kinds, 
and at the same time signed contracts on buying or leasing 104 
planes, some to be delivered this year. 
  To raise enough money for these projects, the communications 
departments have all announced that more foreign funds will be 
used. 
  Materials show that since the mid-1980s, 23 Chinese 
provinces, cities and autonomous regions have used some 1.7 
billion U.S. dollars in loans from international monetary 
organizations or foreign governments to construct 7,000 km of 
highways. The Ministry of Railways has used 3.68 billion U.S. 
dollars in foreign funds, and it is predicted that this year 
over one billion U.S. dollars will be introduced. CAAC and the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will also inject 
foreign funds into construction projects.

  [Text] Beijing, 18 January (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Since 
Deng Xiaoping said that "the popularization of computers must 
begin with the children" 10 years ago, more than 3 million 
primary and middle school students have received computer 
training, which is gradually becoming part of primary and middle 
school education in China. 
  To mark the 10th publication anniversary of Deng Xiaoping's 
strategic instruction that "the popularization of computers must 
begin with the children" and to promote the popular application 
of computers among the vast number of youngsters, the Children 
Work Committee under the Soong Ching Ling Foundation, the 
Central Educational Science Research Institute, and the 
Popularization Department of the China Science and Technology 
Association jointly sponsored the 1994 national activities to 
popularize Chinese- character picture coding. 
  The current activities seek to further promote the popular 
application of computers in primary and middle schools across 
the nation, to guide the vast number of primary and middle 
school students in studying and mastering the computer skills 
and techniques, to bring the important role of computers in 
promoting education and teaching into full play, and to lay a 
foundation for China to train qualified personnel who can cross 
into the next century. 
  The current activities focused on Chinese-character picture 
coding, a new type of Chinese-character input system based on 
the standard Chinese characters. Using images, the coding is 
simple and easy to master and use. Both a computer input system 
and a Chinese- character indexing system, it will play a great 
role in accelerating the students' pace of learning Chinese 
characters and will standardize the writing of Chinese 
characters. 
  The current activities will last from January to October 
1994. In March and April, the Central Television Station will 
broadcast "A Television Lecture on Popularizing the Application 
of the Chinese- Character Picture Input System" in its first 
program and its "Watching Together With Daddy and Mommy" 
program. The contest is divided into two stages: The 
Chinese-character picture coding computer input contest and the 
Chinese-character picture coding computer writing contest. 
Youngsters throughout the country, from first grade primary 
school pupils to junior and senior middle school students 
(including students of technical secondary schools, vocational 
senior schools, and polytechnic schools) can enter their names 
for participation.

  [Text] Washington, January 28 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Bill Clinton's National Security Adviser W. Anthony Lake said 
today that further improvement and development of U.S.-Chinese 
relations is of great strategic significance. 
  Lake made the statement during his meeting at the White 
House 
with visiting Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu, who 
arrived here Tuesday [25 January] at the invitation of the State 
Department for political consultations. 
  The Sino-U.S. informal summit meeting in Seattle last 
November was important to both sides and it is very encouraging 
that the channels for dialogue are open and contacts are 
increasing, Lake said. 
  Both sides have done their part to improve their relations, 
and Washington in no way "belittles" the positive steps taken by 
the Chinese side, Lake said. 
  He expressed the belief that with such continuous joint 
efforts, it is certain that U.S.-China relations will constantly 
improve and develop. 
  In reply, the Chinese vice minister said the Seattle summit 
marked a new beginning for improving Sino-U.S. relations and 
both sides should seize upon the favorable opportunity to push 
their ties back onto the normal track. 
  There exist broad and common interests between China and the 
United States, Liu said, adding that the two sides should start 
from the fundamental interests of the people of the two 
countries and the overall situation in developing mutually 
beneficial cooperation. 
  Changes in the world situation have not altered the 
importance of Sino-U.S. relations, Liu said, adding that their 
differences should be properly settled through candid dialogues. 
As for the differences which cannot be settled for the moment, 
the two sides should seek common grounds while preserving the 
differences and should not let the differences block the 
development of their relations. 
  Liu stressed that both sides should face reality, respect 
each other's actual situation, take an attitude of seeking truth 
from facts and appropriately solve their existing differences 
through joint earnest efforts and on the basis of mutual respect 
and equality, thus enabling their relations to advance in a 
healthy and stable way. 
  Besides meeting Lake, Liu also held separate meetings today 
with Assistant to the U.S. President for Economic Policy Robert 
Rubin and his deputy W. Bowman Cutter. 
  The American hosts expressed their admiration for the 
achievements China has made since its reforms and opening up to 
the outside world and they are optimistic about the prospects of 
China's development in the coming years. 
  In view of the changes that have taken place in China in the 
past 15 years, Rubin noted, there are reasons to believe that 
China will become one of the world's strongest economies in the 
first half of the next century. 
  He said Washington is fully aware of the good opportunity 
that China's development has provided for the U.S. economy and 
hopes that the difficulties in bilateral relations will be 
solved as soon as possible so that multi-cooperation of great 
potentials would be further strengthened and expanded. 
  Meanwhile, Cutter said that China is of strategic 
significance to the United States and nobody can deny this. 
  Despite their differences, opportunities for further 
cooperation outstrip the existing problems, Cutter said. 
  It really conforms with the interests of both countries for 
the United States to handle its relations with China from a 
long-term point of view, he said. 
  Cutter said both sides are experienced in settling their 
differences through mature and wise ways and the U.S. is willing 
to continue to work with China in overcoming the differences and 
strengthening their cooperation.

Do Not Interfere in Other Countries' Internal Affairs"] 
  [Text] A basic criterion for establishing normal relations 
between states is precisely non-interference in other countries' 
internal affairs; that can be found in the United Nations 
Charter as well as many international declarations and 
statements. Regretfully, incidents of interfering in other 
countries' internal affairs have taken place one after another. 
In the past, when the two superpowers dominated the world, it 
was primarily the United States and the USSR that interfered 
with other countries' internal affairs. The Soviet Army's 
invasion of Afghanistan and U.S. Army's invasion of Panama are 
the most conspicuous examples in our memory. In the wake of the 
disintegration of the USSR, the United States is the only 
country that can constantly interfere with other countries' 
internal affairs while claiming itself the international 
policeman. 
<H5>  The Inauguration of "Radio Free Asia" Is a Hegemonist Act </H5>
  In recent years, the United States has consistently created 
disputes in its relations with China and has interfered with 
China's internal affairs, resulting in great disharmony in 
bilateral relations. Since U.S. President Clinton held a summit 
and invited Chinese State President Jiang Zemin to visit 
Seattle, the U.S. Administration's attitude toward China has 
tended to be realistic; ties between officials of the two sides 
have markedly increased; their mutual understanding has been 
greatly enhanced; and the momentum of development has been 
sound. However, anyone can see that there is always some 
element within the United States that is unwilling to see the 
normalization of international relations, especially Sino-U.S. 
relations, and is doing all it can to set up hurdles. The 
so-called "Radio Free Asia" that primarily targets China is 
precisely one of their most up-to-date inventions. A few days 
ago, the U.S. Senate officially adopted the bill on establishing 
"Radio Free Asia." Due to the U.S. economic recession, the 
United States is having difficulty making ends meet in its 
financial situation; the U.S. Federal Government has already 
received complaints from Los Angeles earthquake victims because 
it is unable to provide Los Angeles more money for relief 
purposes. Nevertheless, at this particular moment, they would 
rather spend a huge sum starting up "Radio Free Asia" -- why? 
Its real aim is precisely to utilize the station to create 
disputes, instigate turmoil, and realize the goal of interfering 
the internal affairs of China as well as other Asian countries. 
This being the case, the bill has naturally met with opposition 
from China and the other Asian countries. Such behavior of 
brazenly trampling upon international law and the criterion of 
international relations is a demonstration of its stubborn 
hegemonist ideas. 
<H5>  Be Vigilant Against the Americans' Frame-Up </H5>
  Not long ago, news suddenly appeared in the U.S. press that 
prohibited chemicals that had been manufactured in China were 
found on a German vessel berthed in a Saudi Arabian port. The 
reports claimed that the marketing of these substances had been 
banned by an international agreement, and they could be used to 
create nuclear and biochemical weapons. When the news spread, 
many people associated it with the "Yinhe" incident that had 
been unilaterally created by the United States last summer. 
That incident went bankrupt due to the Americans' inferior 
handling of the situation; their plot was seen through and ended 
with their losing face throughout the world. The day before 
yesterday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman 
explained the current issue. The fact was that, in response to 
the repeated requests of a U.S. company, a Chinese company sold 
a certain quantity of prohibited chemicals to that company in 
violation of the relevant regulations of the Chinese Government. 
The destination and purpose of those chemicals were entirely 
the business of the U.S. company in question. Of course, the 
matter must be investigated and clarified. Nevertheless, people 
cannot help but ask why the U.S. press should have singled out 
Saudi Arabia, Germany and China, but left out the country that 
was most directly related, namely, the United States? Was it out 
of neglect, omission, or a trick to feint to the east and attack 
in the west to deceive the public? Drawing a lesson from the 
"Yinhe" incident, people have ample grounds for asking a few 
more questions.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "After a Whopping Ending, </F>
What's Next for U.S. Economy?"] 
  [Text] Washington, January 28 (XINHUA) -- From 0.8 percent 
a year ago to 1.9 percent last spring. From 2.9 percent in 
autumn to the much-awaited whopping ending -- 5.9 percent growth 
in the fourth quarter. 
  The leap of last year's U.S. economy is a bit like crazy, 
casting the shadow of recession far and away. 
  But is such a progress sustainable or is it heading toward a 
nose dive? 
  "The last quarter is often supercharged, with Christmas 
shopping and everything," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist 
for PNC Bank Corp. based in Pittsburgh. "This year is a 
different thing." 
  The Commerce Department reported today that the U.S. gross 
domestic product, the total goods and services produced in the 
country, grew by 2.9 percent last year, the biggest climb since 
1988. 
  Earlier, it was reported that the country's industrial 
production was up 4.2 percent last year, the biggest gain since 
1988, housing starts and home resales reached four-year and 
14-year high respectively, with consumer price gaining the 
smallest in seven years. 
  President Clinton is taking credit for the economic 
successes 
in 1993, especially with his respectable assault on the budget 
deficit. The deficit is expected to decline by another 40 
percent in fiscal 1995. 
  The 20-year low interest rates, the direct result of budget 
cuts, is becoming a potent tool for pulling the economy out of 
recession, observers said. 
  But the upturn, as most observers see it, is mostly a 
product 
of the normal business cycle. 
  Last year, the strong productivity-enhancing investment was 
coupled with strong pent-up consumer demands, especially in 
automobiles and home furnishings. 
  In recent months, retail sales, sales of business equipment, 
home building, especially the single-family housing starts, and 
the long- in-the-doldrums merchandise export all turned for the 
better. 
  But the recovery has skipped some regions, California in 
particular, and left many workers still without jobs. The newly 
added jobs are mostly part time and substandard in earnings, 
observers here said. 
  There are four sectors remaining what economists described 
as 
"truly weak": defense production, civilian aircraft making, 
business spending for commercial real estate, and multi-family 
housing. 
  Some economists predicted the growth in 1994 will slow down 
because of the declining bank reserves, a key indicator for 
trading of bank loans, and consumer spending which they said has 
been out of line with real consumer income. 
  "There were numerous straws in the wind suggesting that the 
increase will not be sustainable in 1994," said Erich 
Herinemann, chief economist of New York-based investment company 
Ladernburg, Thalman &amp; Co.. "Indeed, there are signs a 
slowdown 
may already be underway." 
  Another impediments is the danger of inflation. American 
Bankers Association (ABA) predicted on Thursday the consumer 
price index, the most common measure of inflation, will rise 
from 2.7 percent last year to 3.0 percent in 1994. 
  "While inflation has come down, underlying inflationary 
pressure cannot be counted out," ABA's economic advisory 
committee said in its semi-annual report. "Decisive action in 
the coming months would keep inflation on the ropes." 
  Some private forecasters, meanwhile, are worried about the 
tax hikes on the rich individuals who are resources for most new 
investments, and more government regulations in the health care 
industry. 
  "It's too early to tell how tax hikes will reduce potential 
economic growth," said Paul Merski, an economist with "citizens 
for a sound economy" in the nation's capital. "But it will be 
felt by hundreds of small businesses and their workers," he said.

  [Text] Washington, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Deputy Attorney 
General Philip Heymann, the No. 2 official in the U.S. Justice 
Department, resigned today because of different "operating and 
management styles" with Attorney General Janet Reno. 
  Yet, in a joint press conference, neither elaborated on what 
the operating and management differences were. 
  In a letter to President Bill Clinton this morning, Heymann, 
a Harvard law professor who headed the department's criminal 
division during the Carter administration, said: "The attorney 
general has concluded that our operational and management styles 
are too different for us to function fully effectively as a 
management team." 
  Heymann is in charge of many of the operational functions of 
the department and is a key manager in coordinating operations 
among department agencies, such as the FBI, the drug enforcement 
administration and the immigration and naturalization service. 
  The deputy attorney said he would stay on for a reasonable 
time so that a successor could be found. But he said he 
intended to return to teaching at Harvard University this summer.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The Industrial and 
Commercial Bank of China has decided to bring in U.S. software 
for its computerization. 
  The Industrial and Commercial Bank, China's largest 
specialized bank, has taken the lead in the computerization of 
Chinese banks. At the end of last year, the bank signed a 
contract with Unix China Ltd. for the purchase of 2,000 sets of 
the Unix SVR 4.2/CE system valued at Rmb [renminbi] 3 million 
yuan. 
  Unix China Ltd. is a joint venture between companies from 
the 
U.S., Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland. The SVR 4.2 system 
was developed by the U.S. partners. 
  Jia Yaoliang, president of Unix China Ltd., said at today's 
press conference that the Industrial and Commercial Bank is the 
first large-scale state-owned Chinese financial enterprise to 
purchase licensed software in batches. 
  He also noted that the bank's purchase of licensed software 
will reflect China's implementation of regulations for software 
protection, as well as establish China's software industry and 
promote international cooperation.

  [Text] Moscow, January 30 (XINHUA) -- Russia and China have 
established new relationships based on normal cooperation, said 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Vladimirovich Kozyrev today. 
  Kozyrev made the remarks in an interview with the ITAR-TASS 
News Agency when he was flying home Sunday [30 January] morning 
from an official visit to China, during which he held talks with 
his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen on the development of 
bilateral relations. 
  He said the relations between the two nations are now more 
than normal, as border trade and cooperation in economy, 
military technology and other areas are making headway. 
  But still there are new areas to be tapped for bilateral 
cooperation, the Russian minister noted. 
  Kozyrev also said it is possible for the two powers to 
coordinate their interests in Asia and worldwide.

  [Text] Moscow, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The Russian Defense 
Ministry signed a 1994 bilateral military cooperation plan with 
a visiting NATO delegation here today. 
  The ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY said the plan contains 50 
cooperative items including the exchange of military leaders and 
experts, joint military maneuvers and training exercises as well 
as opportunities for Russian officers to visit NATO states for 
advanced studies in military academies there. 
  The NATO delegation arrived in Moscow on Thursday [27 
January] and both sides have held talks on how to find a 
solution to the crises in hot-spot areas amongst countries who 
are members of the commonwealth of independent states. 
  The delegation said NATO will provide aid to Russian 
peacekeepers in these areas, but will not become directly 
involved in peacekeeping action by deploying forces. 
  NATO maintains, however, that Russia's peacekeeping 
operations in the trouble areas of the former Soviet Union 
should be under the control of the United Nations.

  [Text] Moscow, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Russia's vice prime 
minister in charge of agriculture, Aleksandr Zaveryukha, said 
today that the reform of the country's agro-industrial complexes 
are to be speeded up and deepened. 
  Zaveryukha told a news conference Russia's agriculture is 
facing difficulties as many farms do not have enough money to 
buy machinery, fertilizer and fuels. 
  The minister listened to a criticism by former Finance 
Minister Boris Fedorov, who said that Zaveryukha's demand for 
more money for the complexes he is in charge of is "excessive." 
such criticism was "absurd," Zaveryukha said. 
  However, Zaveryukha stressed that the situation may even 
worsen if the country's agriculture industry isn't funded 
properly. 
  Referring to the 1993 harvest, when Russia realized a total 
of 100 million tons of grain, Zaveryukha said that the crop did 
not reach the expected output due to climatic and financial 
problems. 
  Zaveryukha said that the government will continue to carry 
out the reforms and impose its tough financial policies, 
pointing out that the new cabinet is conforming to the needs of 
the times.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Election of New Speaker Calms Belarus </F>
Parliament"] 
  [Text] Moscow, January 29 (XINHUA) -- The Belarussian 
parliament calmed the political turmoil that has swept through 
it this week by electing Mechyslav Grib as its new speaker on 
Friday [29 January] night. 
  This followed a two-round ballot to replace the former 
speaker Stanislav Shushkevich who was fired earlier this week in 
a secret ballot in parliament. 
  Grib, a professional lawyer, is head of the parliament's 
permanent commission for national security, defense and 
anti-crime struggle. 
  Regarded as a supporter of Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, 
Grib favors deepening the integration with Russia and supports 
government plans to combat the country's current economic crisis. 
  Grib's predecessor, Shushkevich, lost a no-confidence vote 
Wednesday after being criticized for "having not taken effective 
steps against corruption." 
  But analysts said that the change was an inevitable outcome 
of the long-term disagreements within Belarussian parliament. 
They said that the charges against Shushkevich were just an 
excuse used to oust him because he advocates a market economy 
and supports neutrality in diplomacy. 
  Shushkevich became the speaker of the Belarussian parliament 
after the "August 19" incident of 1991. But he didn't set up 
his own group in the parliament while in office and held 
different views from the Kebich-led majority group on major 
policies to be followed by Belarus as an independent state. 
  The majority group believes that the former Soviet republic 
cannot maintain absolute neutrality under the present situation, 
and that instead, must cooperate with Russia in economic areas 
due to historical ties. 
  Before Wednesday's sacking of Shushkevich, the parliament 
had 
made three attempts to vote him out of office. Last July, the 
parliament failed to oust the former speaker by just eight 
votes. He had opposed Belarus signing the collective security 
treaty of the CIS. 
  In a bid to shake off this crisis of confidence in him, 
Shushkevich set about improving relations with the majority 
group in recent months. 
  But Shushkevich's plans backfired. He not only failed to win 
more support but also lost even more of his backers. 
  Observers pointed out that Belarus has returned again to a 
situation where the country is governed by only one political 
force. 
  Prime Minister Kebich promised on Friday that his government 
will continue its reform efforts towards a market economy. 
However, he said, the reform policy will be revised 
fundamentally on the basis of careful consideration and that the 
country will not take the road of radical reform as was adopted 
by Russia.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 30 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) today accused the United 
States of strengthening its military forces in South Korea, 
warning that the moves could bring the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war. 
  A spokesman from the Committee for the Peaceful 
Reunification 
of the Fatherland said in a statement that the U.S. military 
activity was a grave provocation which will never be tolerated. 
  According to reports, the United States has sent a "U.S. 
state intelligence-supporting team" to South Korea aimed at 
intensifying its activities for selecting intelligence about the 
DPRK. The reports also say the U.S. plans to deploy Patriot 
missiles in South Korea. 
  Meanwhile, the United States has stated that it will stage 
other types of joint military exercises with South Korea to 
replace the "Team Spirit" exercise which may be halted this year. 
  The statement from DPRK said the move by U.S. and South 
Korean military was a well planned provocation which will drive 
the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. 
  It has also created an obstacle for the solution of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the statement added. 
  The spokesman declared that the DPRK has prepared either for 
dialogue or for war. "Our people will never tolerate these 
dangerous hostile acts or the latest war provocation moves of 
the U.S. and South Korean rulers," he stressed. 
  He demanded that the United States stop the provocation and 
immediately withdraw its troops, intelligence personnel and 
nuclear weapons from South Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, head of the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), finally reached a 
compromise on political reform bills at a meeting tonight, after 
desperate efforts to end a week-long impasse. 
  The new accord will see members of the House of 
Representatives elected through a combination of 300 single-seat 
constituencies and 200 proportional representation seats to be 
distributed in 11 electoral blocs across the country. 
  The new formula will replace the existing multi-seat 
constituencies. 
  On the question of political donations, the compromise 
agreement will allow individual politicians to designate one 
organization to collect funds from corporations. 
  The compromise came after a joint committee of both houses 
of 
the Diet (parliament) had failed to settle the past week's 
differences between the ruling coalition and opposition parties. 
  In a last-minute bid to avoid a political crisis, Takako 
Doi, 
speaker of the lower house, invited Hosokawa and Kono to hold a 
meeting and after two hours they reached a basic accord. 
  It is likely that the compromise plan may be tabled to the 
Diet for a vote tomorrow, the last day for the current 
parliamentary session. 
  In the original proposals, the coalition advocated 274 
single-seat districts and 226 seats allotted by proportional 
representation, while the LDP wanted 300 single-seat 
constituencies and 200 seats allotted by proportional 
representation. 
  The ruling parties, meanwhile, were in favor of a ban on 
political donations but the LDP called for limited fund-raising 
for individual politicians.

  [Text] Tokyo, January 29 (XINHUA) -- Japan's Diet finally 
approved the government-proposed package of political reform 
bills today following a stand-up vote by both houses of the 
parliament. 
  The approval saved led Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa a 
deep political crisis -- the resignation of the entire cabinet 
or a dissolution of parliament for a snap election. [sentence 
as received] 
  Hosokawa himself had indicated earlier he would quit if he 
failed to get the reform measures passed during the current 
parliamentary session which ended today. 
  The package was a compromise version of the original reform 
bills. The deal was struck last night at a meeting between 
Hosokawa and Yohei Kono, head of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). 
  But no date is set for the implementation of the adopted 
bills. Under the compromise deal, the revision of these bills 
will be deliberated in the next regular Diet session which is 
scheduled to open Monday [31 January]. 
  According to the new version of the package, members of the 
lower house will be elected through a combination of 300 
single-seat districts and 200 seats of proportional 
representation based on 11 blocs across the country. The ruling 
coalition had proposed a 274-226 split. 
  On anti-corruption measures, the compromise plan permits 
corporations or organizations to offer limited donations to 
local legislators instead of Diet members. 
  The version also promises that such corporate donations will 
be completely banned in five years. The original bills stood 
for a blanket ban on such donations with immediate effect. 
  The political reforms, which are aimed at eliminating "money 
politics" and enhancing political openness, have been debated in 
Japan for years. 
  Unlike his predecessors, Hosokawa has promised to make the 
political reforms his top priority since he took office last 
August and hinted he would resign if reform legislation failed. 
  His original reform bills received a nod from the lower 
house 
of the parliament last November, but was rejected by the upper 
house last week because of the rebellion of 20 deputies of the 
socialists, the biggest partner within the coalition government. 
  The passage of the reform bills leaves the Hosokawa 
government free to concentrate on mapping out measures to pull 
the economy out of a persistent recession. 
  Hosokawa also must turn his attention to working out the 
1994 
fiscal budget and solving the trade dispute with the United 
States. 
  However, the government still faces the uphill task of 
pushing ahead with the reforms, as many socialist lawmakers have 
publicly said "no" to the part of the government plan which 
allows individual politicians to accept limited donations.

  [Text] Manila, January 29 (XINHUA) -- China and the United 
States play a "vital role" in the Asia-Pacific regional 
security, President Fidel Ramos said in a letter to South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam. 
  Copies of the letter was released today by the Presidential 
Palace and was said to be delivered by former President Corazon 
Aquino who is visiting Seoul as guest of honor of a forum 
sponsored by the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the 
Asia-Pacific Region. 
  "The relationship between China and the United States is 
important for the security of our region and that the current 
difficulties besetting that relationship should be resolved with 
the long-term interest of the region in mind," Ramos said in the 
letter. 
  He did not elaborate how the Philippines and South Korea 
could help ease the difficulties between China and U.S., mainly 
disagreement on human rights and trade issues. 
  Ramos also sought Kim's views, saying he would be grateful 
for the South Korean president's support on this matter. 
  The two presidents met twice since they assumed offices, one 
in Seoul last May during Ramos' state visit to South Korea, the 
other in Seattle last November when both attended the informal 
meeting of leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum (APEC). 
  "We learned that much could be achieved for our region 
through frank and informal exchanges of views and opinions," 
Ramos said.

  [Text] Manila, January 28 (XINHUA) -- A group of Chinese 
investors and their Filipino counterparts today formed a joint 
venture company that will operate the first communications 
satellite for the Philippines. 
  The joint venture, named as the Philippine Satellite 
Consortium, was created in compliance with a contract signed by 
Beijing Highden Enterprise Ltd., subsidiary of China Everbright 
Group Companies, and a Philippine consortium led by the CLMC 
Group. 
  Lu Changsheng, director and president of the Beijing 
Highden, 
said the Philippine Satellite Consortium will buy and launch a 
communications satellite for the country in two to three years 
upon the approval by the government of the joint venture project. 
  The project, dubbed as "Philippines Satellite 2000," will 
require at least 200 million U.S. dollars, Lu said. 
  It is one of the joint ventures agreed by the Filipino and 
Chinese investors during President Fidel Ramos' state visit to 
China last April. 
  China has committed the Philippine Government that the 
satellite will be totally owned, controlled and operated by 
Filipinos. 
  Roberto de Vevenia, president of the CLMC Group, said during 
a press conference held here today that the Philippines is fully 
confident of the Chinese technologies in the manufacturing and 
launching of satellites. 
  Therefore, he said the China Great Wall Industry Corporation 
(CGWIC), the only government-authorized company responsible for 
and providing launching services of commercial rockets and 
manufacture of communications satellites, is one of the 
strongest competitors for the project. 
  The CGWIC has already launched three communications 
satellites and two scientific experiment satellites for users 
from Hong Kong, Australia, Pakistan and Sweden since it began 
providing launching service for foreign users in 1990.

  [Text] Hanoi, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Vietnam today 
welcomed the United States Senate's vote for a resolution urging 
President Bill Clinton to lift the economic embargo against the 
country. 
  The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry described the vote as a 
"positive move which is in accordance with the reality and 
aspirations of the American people." 
  "The resolution would receive extensive support from the 
United States and from world public opinion," it said in a 
written reply to reporters' questions. 
  The U.S. Senate voted 62-38 in favor of the resolution 
calling for the lifting of the 20-year-old economic embargo. 
  The embargo imposed on Vietnam in 1964 [date as received] by 
Washington extended to cover the whole of the country after the 
south was liberated in 1975. 
  The U.S. Administration has maintained that Vietnam's 
cooperation in fully solving the issue of American prisoners of 
war and missing-in-actions is the precondition for lifting 
sanctions and the normalization of relations between the two 
countries.

  [Text] Washington, January 28 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. 
Administration has not made any decision on the lifting of the 
trade embargo against Vietnam, the State Department said here 
today. 
  The U.S. Senate voted by 62 to 38 yesterday to urge the 
Clinton administration to lift expeditiously the U.S. embargo on 
trade with Vietnam. 
  The department spokeswoman Christine Shelly told a regular 
news briefing that "no decision has been made there on the 
lifting of the trade embargo and there isn't any time frame for 
reaching such a decision." 
  Shelly said, "It's something which remains under review, and 
the administration has indicated that it would consider the 
views of all sides of this issue," including the Senate 
resolution. 
  She also said there are some who believe that U.S. should 
move on to the normalization of relations with Vietnam and there 
are others who think that the continued accounting for the POWs 
and the MIAs absolutely must come first. 
  "There are arguments that can be made on both sides," Shelly 
said, "but I don't think the administration has specifically 
taken a position on one or the other." 
  However, she noted that "the President has linked further 
progress in our relations with Vietnam to achieving the fullest 
possible accounting on the POWs and the MIAs." 
  "The key thing for us is to get to the point where we are 
completely satisfied with the accounting for the POWs and the 
MIAs and then to take things from there," Shelly added.

<F P=106> [By reporters Wang Yadong (3769 0068 2639), Li Houzhi (2621 </F>

  [Text] Khartoum, 22 Jan (XINHUA) -- Sudanese President 
Bashir said: Between Sudan and China, there are special 
friendly ties that are different from the others and are growing 
day by day. 
  Bashir made these remarks during an interview with Chinese 
journalists at the Friendship Hall of the capital Khartoum this 
afternoon. 
  He said: Sudan and China support and respect each other in 
political issues. With China's support, Sudan has constructed a 
number of projects and the Chinese people offer their support to 
Sudan without attaching any conditions. China has never 
interfered in Sudan's internal affairs; the recent friendly 
visit of Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and foreign minister, 
has promoted bilateral relations to a new stage. 
  Bashir noted: Sudan has drawn up a long-term program for 
economic development and it will face the Orient and open up to 
Asian countries to develop its economy and overcome current 
difficulties. Sudan welcomes investment from Chinese 
entrepreneurs and hopes to expand its cooperation with China in 
the economic field. 
  Speaking on Sudan's southern problem, Bashir stressed: The 
southern problem is a political issue, which can only be solved 
through political negotiations. As soon as the National 
Salvation Revolution Command Council took power, it convened a 
national meeting with participation of people from various 
parties, seeking appropriate ways to solve the southern problem. 
Following this meeting, it held peace talks with the opposition 
forces of the south in Addis Ababa, Nairobi, and Abuja. The 
protracted civil war in the south has harmed the interests of 
the Sudanese people. The Sudanese Government has paid great 
attention to the settlement of this problem through peaceful 
means and has made unremitting efforts toward this.

  [Text] Vienna, January 28 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
leader said here today that the People's Republic of China has 
tried its best to develop democracy since its founding. 
  In the process of developing democracy, China will not copy 
from the modes of foreign countries, but should learn from 
other's useful experiences according to its own national 
conditions. 
  "This is the way that we have chosen," said Qiao Shi, 
visiting chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) 
Standing Committee, at a meeting with President Alfred Gerstl 
and Vice-Presidents Walter Strutzenberger and Herbert Schambeck, 
of the Federal Council of Austria. 
  Qiao said China and Austria are in the different period of 
development. There still exists a gap between the two countries 
in economic growth. 
  However, "this does not affect our bilateral ties. On the 
contrary, it makes us to place greater importance on promoting 
our friendship and friendly ties," he said. 
  Gerstl thanked China for taking care of Jewish refugees in 
Shanghai during World War II. 
  Meanwhile, he presented Qiao with a book which records the 
history of Jewish nation. 
  Qiao said the Chinese people have always sympathized with 
the 
Jewish nation when it is struggling for its own subsistence. 
  Schambeck said he quite agreed with Qiao's view on the 
development of democracy, adding that democracy must be linked 
with a country's stability. 
  Strutzenberger said since the establishment of diplomatic 
ties between the two countries 23 years ago, their relationship 
has been developed very well. 
  Austria welcomes and appreciates China's successful policy 
of 
opening to the outside world, he said. 
  Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee, 
attended the meeting.

  [Text] Vienna, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Top Chinese 
legislator Qiao Shi said here today that he believed that his 
current visit to Austria will achieve a success. 
  Qiao Shi, chairman of the China's National People's Congress 
(NPC) Standing Committee, made these remarks at a luncheon in 
honor of him hosted by Heinz Fischer, president of the National 
Council of Austria, here today. 
  Qiao, who is paying an official goodwill visit to Austria as 
the guest of Fischer, said over the past two days, he has had 
very good meetings and talks with the Austrian leaders. 
  "We have shared identical views on most of the major issues, 
and also had temporarily different views on some other issues," 
he said. 
  However, he said, there is a hope we can gradually reach 
identical or similar views through further discussions." 
  He said, since China and Austria established diplomatic ties 
in 1971, the two countries have enjoyed sound relationship. 
  Looking toward the future, he said such ties will become 
closer, he added. 
  Fischer said he has talked a lot with Qiao over the past two 
days. To exchange views with each other is of great 
significance, he added. 
  He said he believed that at the end of Qiao's visit to 
Austria, he will feel that he has visited a country full of 
friendly sentiments toward China. 
  Fischer wished China prosperity and development. 
  The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Qiao Shi's Three-West European Nation Tour </F>
Successful"] 
  [Text] Vienna, January 30 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, 
today ended his 15-day official goodwill visit to Germany, 
Switzerland and Austria with a great success. 
  Qiao is the first top NPC leader to visit West Europe since 
New China was founded in 1949, and also another significant 
visit abroad following his five-ASEAN nation tour last year. 
  Sources from the NPC said: "The visit marks that the 
relationship between China and these three countries have 
entered a new stage of the all-round development." 
  During the visit, Qiao had talks and meetings on more than 
20 
separate occasions with the three countries' presidents, 
government and parliament leaders and exchanged views with them 
on bilateral ties, parliament-to-parliament exchanges and 
cooperation in particular, international or regional situation 
as well as issues of common concern. 
  "They have reached consensus on a wide range of issues, thus 
promoting mutual understanding and friendship and laying a sound 
basis for developing bilateral ties in depth, the sources said, 
adding that "the visit has achieved anticipated results." 
  During the talks and meetings, the leaders between China and 
the three countries all set their eyes on their future 
relationship. 
  All of them agreed that furthering and enhancing the 
existing 
good ties between China and the three countries will not only 
benefit the both, but also play an unmeasurable roles in 
safeguarding the world peace and stability. 
  China and Germany are two important and influential 
countries 
in the world. 
  During the visit, the leaders of the two countries had the 
full confidence in the prospects for bilateral ties. 
  Qiao stressed that in developing Sino-German ties, the two 
countries should not only set their eyes on the 90s in this 
century, but also toward the next century. 
  He said it is imperative to handle such relationship with a 
strategic sight and develop long-term and stable friendly ties 
and cooperation between the two countries stradling across the 
next century on the basis of mutual respect and trust, seeking 
common ground while reserving differences and equality and 
mutual benefit. 
  Switzerland is one of the first Western countries to 
establish diplomatic ties with China. 
  The two sides shared a common view that vigorous and dynamic 
economy in China will create more favorable conditions for the 
expansion of the all-round development of bilateral relations. 
  The Swiss side showed great interest in conducting economic 
cooperation with China. 
  Austria which is regarded as the "home of music" has enjoyed 
special and good relations with China. 
  Qiao noted during the visit that both China and Austria are 
in the different period for development. There still exists a 
gap between the two countries in economic growth. But it does 
not affect bilateral ties, and on the contrary makes them attach 
greater importance to their friedship and ties in the future. 
  The past few years have seen rapid development of bilateral 
economic ties and trade. 
  Statistics show that from January to November last year, the 
volume of trade between China on the one hand, Germany, 
Switzerland and Austria on the other amounted respectively to 
8.34 billion U.S. dollars, 1.08 billion U.S. dollars and 364 
million U.S. dollars, representing increases of 64.3 percent, 
91.6 percent and 5.9 percent respectively compared with the same 
period of 1992. 
  By the end of last June, the number of the German-invested 
enterprises in China rose to 386 with a total investment of 
1.365 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Switzerland invested a total of 210 million U.S. dollars in 
88 enterprises in China. 
  Qiao's visit to these three countries opened a broad 
prospect 
for such economic ties and trade. 
  During the visit, Qiao Shi also held working talks with top 
parliamentary leaders of the three countries, exchanged with 
them experiences on the parliament work, thus playing a positive 
role in strengthening cooperation and exchanges between the NPC 
and the three parliaments. 
  Qiao formally invited Rita Suessmuth, president of the 
National Assembly of Germany, to visit China and welcomed 
Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock to China too. 
  Qiao also announced the establishment of a China-Germany 
friendship group for parliamentary members. 
  Qiao also reaffirmed China's consistent stand on the issues 
of human rights and Tibet. The central government's policy 
toward dalai lama remains unchanged, he said. 
  "Dalai Lama is welcome to Tibet. Every issue that we can 
talk about, except the issue of `Tibet independence'," he said. 
[sentence as received] 
  On the issue of human rights, Qiao said it is imperative to 
integrate with every country's reality while talking about this 
issue. 
  Qiao expounded this issue to the leaders of the three 
countries by using China's modern history. 
  He said: "It is an arduous task for us to solve the problems 
of clothing, food, housing, transportation, education and 
employment in China which has a population of 1.1 billion." 
  The aim of safeguarding state sovereignty and maintaining 
its 
domestic stability by the Chinese Government is to continuously 
guarantee its reform and opening up. "The fundamental way to 
ensure the Chinese people to enjoy the human rights is to 
concentrate our efforts on developing economy and productive 
forces, raise our comprehensive national strength and improve 
the people's living standards," Qiao said. 
  Both Qiao and the leaders of the three countries held that 
the direct dialogues between them on the relevant issues of 
common concern is beneficial to promoting mutual understanding 
and trust on the basis of seeking common ground while reserving 
differences. 
  Looking toward the future, it is believed that Qiao's visit 
to the three countries will exert a great influence on the 
promoting closer relationship between China and the three 
countries.

  [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Alain Peyrefitte, 
visiting special envoy of French Prime Minister Balladur, voiced 
his hope here today that the French-Chinese "friendship train" 
would keep running at a sustained high speed. 
  The French envoy expressed this hope at a reception held 
here 
this evening by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship 
With Foreign Countries (CPAFF) to mark the 30th anniversary of 
the establishment of Sino-French diplomatic ties. 
  In his speech, Peyrefitte said his country has always held 
that the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate 
Government of China. 
  After the two countries overcame the recent crisis between 
them, the bilateral ties have been thrust back onto a right 
track, he said. 
  "We see with pleasure that the two governments have reached 
agreements on the improving of Sino-French ties," said Han Xu, 
CPAFF president. 
  "The clouds over the bilateral ties have been dispelled," 
Han 
said, adding that these ties have been brought back to normal 
and would be further developed. 
  "China's reform and opening and its modernization drive have 
entered into a new phase of development, which provides bright 
prospects for Sino-French cooperation and the friendly contacts 
between the two peoples," he said. 
  Among those present at the reception were Wang Hanbin, 
vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National 
People's Congress, French Ambassador to China Francois Plaisant 
and visiting French Senator and Admiral Philippe de Gaulle.

<F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Britain's acceptance that all borrowings incurred 
in building the airport and its associated rail link would be 
counted as Government debt was clinched in secret talks between 
Sir Percy Cradock and Lu Ping in the summer of 1991, Beijing 
revealed yesterday. Mr Lu, director of the State Council's Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO), disclosed the "diplomatic 
understanding" during a meeting of the Preliminary Working 
Committee (PWC) in Beijing yesterday. 
  A member of the airport sub-committee of the PWC Sir 
Sze-yuen 
Chung, quoted Mr Lu as saying it was made clear in discussions 
with Sir Percy that all debt would be government debt for the 
purposes of discussing how much liability would be left for the 
Special Administrative Region government after 1997. According 
to Mr Lu, the ceiling of $5 billion in borrowing -- as 
stipulated in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the 
airport projects -- covered the loans required for the airport 
and its rail link. 
  Mr Lu's claims were rejected by the Government last night as 
legislators urged both sides to release details of all 
negotiations to shed light on the dispute over airport financing 
which was holding up the project. 
  A government spokesman said: "Throughout the (airport) 
negotiations (on the MOU), a distinction was made between 
borrowings by the Hong Kong Government and borrowings by the 
MTRC and PAA. 
  "The MOU limit of $5 billion refers to Hong Kong Government 
borrowings and not to borrowings by the MTRC and PAA." 
  Meeting Point's Zachary Wong Wai-yin said: "We have so much 
hearsay information, I urge both governments to disclose the 
documents and let the truth speak." United Democrats legislator 
Albert Chan Wai-yip said Britain should explain whether Sir 
Percy had struck such a deal as Mr Lu suggested. "Britain will 
need to clarify as to when and where the agreement was made, as 
well as whether Sir Percy was acting in a capacity to make such 
an agreement," he said. 
  Sir Percy, who went to Beijing on behalf of the British 
Prime 
Minister John Major, was said to have initiated the secret deal 
on the airport with Mr Lu on June 30, 1991. On July 2, however, 
the then Governor, Sir David Wilson (now Lord Wilson) denied 
that any deal was reached. Two days later, China and Britain 
announced the MOU. 
  Sir Percy in recent years has been highly critical of the 
British Government, in particular Governor Chris Patten, over 
the handling of China affairs. Instead of accepting secret 
diplomacy as Sir Percy advocated, Mr Patten had adopted a more 
open approach in dealing with China which resulted in his 
constantly confronting Beijing on a wide range of transitional 
issues. 
  According to Sir Sze Yuen, Mr Lu said at that time it was 
clear the Airport Authority (now the Airpor Corporation) would 
be part of the Government but unclear who would build the 
railway. Mr Lu told PWC members that China gave Britain full 
discretion for it to build the railway -- either by itself or by 
a statutory body. 
  But under the MOU, any government borrowing excess of $5 
billion required Chinese consent. 
  Sir Sze-yuen quoted Mr Lu as saying that the airport related 
contracts and franchises straddling 1997 mentioned in the MOU 
should be those in the "diplomatic understanding" agreed with 
Sir Percy. "They have nothing to do with the Basic Law," Mr Lu 
reportedly said. He said although any laws that are not in 
breach of the Basic Law will remain valid after 1997, "someone 
is trying to mislead the public" by saying that those contracts 
and franchises were governed by the Basic Law. It was clearly 
stated in the MOU that contracts and franchises straddling 1997 
must have Chinese consent if they are to be valid after 1997, Mr 
Lu said. 
  The same will apply to the Airport Corporation Bill which 
was 
provided in the MOU as a corporation to be formed under the 
authorisation of the British Government, he added. 
  The MOU requires the British side to seek prior approval 
from 
Beijing on any major airport-related franchises and contracts 
that straddle 1997. 
  On the Chinese opposition against granting the sale of 62 
hectares of land along the railway in one go, Mr Lu has said the 
two sides have already agreed to let the Sino-British Land 
Commission grant the land on an annual basis. China has 
promised to grant approval of the 62 hectares before 1997, Mr Lu 
reportedly said, but that the exact amount of land granted each 
year would depend on market demand. 
  Sir Sze-yuen sidestepped a question on whether Mr Lu 
indicated China has submitted its own counter-proposals, saying 
only that "China does not have the same resources as the Hong 
Kong Government." He argued that under the MOU the British side 
should take the initiative to submit proposals while the Chinese 
side should say yes or no to it. "How can you ask the HKMAO to 
work out any proposal given its small establishment?" he queried. 
  Despite Mr Lu's clarification to the PWC members, they had 
not discussed feasible financial arrangements, Sir Sze-yuen said.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter in Beijing: "Lu Ping </F>
Accuses British Side of Violating Memorandum of Understanding 
and Refutes Hong Kong Government's New Formulation"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--Lu Ping, director of 
the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, today 
refuted the Hong Kong Government's statement on airport loans. 
He pointed out: Neither side raised the question of loans made 
by the Airport Authority in building the airport and its rail 
link when discussing the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] on 
the airport projects, otherwise the sum of money would 
definitely be stated in explicit terms in the MOU. Now the 
British side is putting forward a new formulation, that is, the 
ceiling of 5 billion Hong Kong dollars is only restricted to 
government loans, thus showing that the British side once again 
violates the MOU. 
  After attending a meeting of the Political Affairs 
Subcommittee of the Preliminary Working Committee, Lu Ping told 
this reporter: The Chinese side and its British counterpart 
stated when discussing the MOU that future liabilities left for 
the special administrative regional government must not exceed 5 
billion Hong Kong dollars and that both sides must consult with 
each other if the liabilities were going to exceed this sum. He 
stressed: "At that time, we did not touch the issue at all. 
The British side never talked about how much money the Airport 
Authority would borrow in building the airport and its rail 
link. If they did, it must be definitely stated in explicit 
terms in the MOU that apart from the 5 billion Hong Kong dollars 
government loans, how much the Airport Authority was allowed to 
borrow. Therefore, the British side is now putting forward a 
new formulation which states that the ceiling of 5 billion Hong 
Kong dollars is only restricted to government borrowings, 
showing that the British side once again violates the MOU." 
  Lu Ping also raised the following question: If the British 
side holds that the ceiling of 5 billion Hong Kong dollars is 
only restricted to government loans, whereas loans made by the 
Airport Authority in building the airport and its rail link can 
be excluded from the ceiling, it is not necessary to consult 
with the Chinese side at all since the British side can 
absolutely make their own decision. He said, "The British side 
will not be able to borrow the money without China's 
cooperation."

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by Li Kuo-chung (2621 0948 1813): "Lu </F>
Ping Clarifies Three Points in the Airport Issue and Stresses 
That Franchises Come Under the Diplomatic Sphere"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--Today, Lu Ping, 
director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office [HKMAO] of 
the State Council, clarified for members of the Economic Group 
of the Preliminary Working Committee several points in the 
dispute between China and Britain over the financial 
arrangements for the new airport. The Group also put forward 
over 20 suggestions regarding the Airport Corporation Bill and 
will hand them to the HKMAO for reference later. 
  Sir Sze-yuen Chung, convener of the Airport Issue Study Team 
under the Economic Group, said today after the meeting: 
Regarding the financial arrangements for the new airport, Lu 
Ping had clarified several points for them and disclosed that 
the third proposal put forward by the British side was first 
handed to the Chinese side in April 1993. The proposal included 
the government pumping in HK$42.8 billion [Hong Kong dollars]. 
At the talks that followed, the British side agreed to add 
HK$2.5 billion more, increasing the total amount to HK$45.3 
billion, with the amount of debt coming to approximately HK$40 
billion. The Chinese side estimates that according to the 
financial proposal, the maximum debt can reach HK$45 billion. 
  The three points Lu Ping clarified were: 
  First, some people have misleadingly equated the 
airport-related franchises and contracts straddling 1997 with 
the other laws and regulations that do not conflict with the 
Basic Law and that can apply after 1997. However, laws and 
regulations are one thing and diplomacy is another. If the 
franchises and contracts straddling 1997 did not need the 
consent of the Chinese side, there would have been no need for 
the Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] to include a paragraph 
mentioning that the British side must negotiate with the Chinese 
side over the franchises and contracts straddling 1997. This has 
nothing to do with the Basic Law and is a diplomatic issue. 
  Second, the MOU provides that the government debt must not 
exceed HK$5 billion. Some people argue that the HK$5 billion is 
confined merely to the government and does not include that 
incurred by the Airport Corporation and the airport railway. 
But Lu Ping pointed out: In negotiating the MOU with Percy 
Cradock, the then British special envoy, several years ago, the 
British side did not say that the airport railway was to be 
constructed by the government or by the Airport Corporation. 
The two sides also understood that the Airport Corporation was 
part of the government. The HK$5-billion debt includes the debt 
for the airport railway and the Airport Corporation. It is only 
a matter of "filling the right pocket from the left." 
  Third, regarding the 58 to 60 hectares of land along the 
airport railway, both the Chinese and British sides have agreed 
that the land should be approved by the Land Committee each 
year. The Chinese have also agreed to approve all land along 
the railway before 1997, and the size of the area to be approved 
depends on the need. 
  Sze-yuen Chung maintained: The Airport Corporation derives 
its assets from the government and the debt incurred by the 
Airport Corporation is the debt of the government. If the debt 
of the Airport Corporation is not included in the HK$5-billion 
debt, the Hong Kong Government cannot sit and let the creditors 
take away the land if the Airport Corporation has a debt crisis 
in the future. Therefore, the debt of the Airport Corporation 
should also be included in the government's debt. 
  Another group member, Vincent Hong-sui Lo, also held that 
although the MOU did not deal with the question of debt very 
clearly, by common sense, the Hong Kong Government cannot but 
assume responsibility if the future Airport Corporation and 
railway cannot repay the debt. 
  He said that the two sides already have the MOU on the 
question of the Airport-related franchises and contracts, and 
therefore they should negotiate using this means. 
  In addition, the Airport Issue Study Team also studied the 
Airport Corporation Bill and put forward more than 20 
suggestions. The relevant report will be handed to the HKMAO for 
its reference after being passed by the Economic Group.

<F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Criticizes Hong Kong Government's </F>
Arguments on Airport Loans"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Jan (TA KUNG PAO)--Zhang Junsheng, 
deputy director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, has criticized 
the Hong Kong Government's arguments about the airport loans, 
saying that the Hong Kong Government deliberately disregarded 
and evaded the relevant provisions of the Sino-British 
Memorandum of Understanding on the airport project in an attempt 
to make the future Special Administrative Region [SAR] 
Government bear the responsibility for the consequences of the 
decision unilaterally made by the British Hong Kong authorities 
without consultation between the Chinese side and the British 
side. 
  Before attending an award ceremony held by TA KUNG PAO, 
Zhang 
was asked by reporters to comment on the British Hong Kong 
authorities' argument that the credit line of HK$5 billion [Hong 
Kong dollars] was only part of the credit arrangements made by 
the Hong Kong Government. Zhang said: The Sino-British 
Memorandum of Understanding on the airport issue clearly 
specified the credit limits and arrangements. That is, on 30 
June 1997, the British side should leave HK$25 billion in 
financial reserves for the SAR Government, and the British side 
can arrange loans of less than HK$5 billion with the endorsement 
of the Chinese side. Any loan arrangements that exceed HK$5 
billion which must be borne by the SAR Government must be first 
discussed by the Chinese and British Governments before a final 
decision is made. All this was clearly spelled out in the 
memorandum. 
  He pointed out that the airport memorandum of understanding 
did not indicate that "loans arranged by the Airport Authority 
and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation would not be included 
in the 5-billion-dollar limit." Zhang said that the British 
Hong Kong authorities changed the Airport Authority into a 
corporation in an attempt to dodge the relevant provisions of 
the Memorandum of Understanding. He criticized the British Hong 
Kong authorities for trying to shirk their responsibilities to 
the future SAR government while unilaterally making a decision 
without consulting the Chinese side and without the endorsement 
of the Chinese side.

<F P=106> [By political editor Danny Gittings and Doreen Cheung in </F>
Beijing] 
  [Text] Hong Kong need not fear any more secret deals from 
the past waiting to be sprung upon it by Chinese officials, 
Governor Chris Patten has pledged. Expanding on British denials 
of Chinese allegations about an unpublished understanding over 
airport debt, Mr Patten told the SUNDAY MORNING POST there were 
no secret deals on any subject. 
  "I know of no secret deals relating to political 
development, 
relating to the airport or relating to any other matters," he 
said. "There has been, and will continue to be, private and 
successful diplomacy on a huge number of matters. But I know of 
nothing, of no deal or understanding, which is being denied to 
the people of Hong Kong. None at all." 
  Although Britain has promised not to sign any future secret 
deals, Mr Patten's statement is the first to address local 
concerns that other secret understandings exist, but have yet to 
be publicly revealed. "I don't think anyone could accuse me of 
trying to do deals behind Hong Kong's back," the Governor said. 
"My position on the discussion, on the resolution of these 
issues in the community is pretty clear." 
  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office chief Lu Ping has 
previously refused to rule out the existence of further secret 
deals between Britain and China. The Governor's comments came 
as China yesterday repeated its accusation that a secret deal 
was struck on airport debt in 1991, and launched a fresh attack 
over the issue. 
  Mr Patten stressed he was ready to be "flexible and helpful" 
in putting forward new proposals on airport funding. But he 
warned there was a bottom line beyond which he would not go. 
"I'm not going to make decisions about funding which would be 
unwise and unreasonable to the Hong Kong taxpayer in order to 
try and bring things forward by a week or two," he said. He 
also tacitly questioned China's pledge not to link the airport 
to other issues. "We keep on producing proposals for funding. 
Somehow we never quite pass the test and, each time, the 
Chinese side say, of course, we must separate politics and 
livelihood issues," he said. 
  But speaking in Beijing yesterday, the local deputy director 
of XINHUA (New China News Agency), Zhang Junsheng, accused 
London of changing the name of the body that would run the Chek 
Lap Kok site, to avoid consulting China about its debt. "(The 
British side) has deliberately changed `Airport Authority' into 
'Airport Corporation' to escape from a stipulation in the 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that Britain should consult 
China on any debts handed over to the Special Administrative 
Region Government, and take unilateral actions," he said. 
  The change was made in the recently published Airport Bill, 
and has been criticised by a number of pro-China figures. 
Although Mr Zhang stopped short of saying which title Beijing 
preferred, Mr Lu dropped a strong hint last week, describing the 
body as the "Airport Authority". Mr Zhang also defended Mr Lu's 
allegation of a secret deal, that all airport-related debt 
should fall within the $5-billion limit set out in the MOU. 
  A Government source last night dismissed the Chinese 
accusation, saying the administration had already told Beijing 
it was happy to use whichever title mainland officials 
preferred. "We have suggested using the name `corporation' on 
the airport solely because it is more suitable for an 
organisation operating in the commercial world than `authority' 
which, in Hong Kong, is used for regulatory bodies, such as the 
Monetary Authority," a Government spokesman said. "The name has 
no other significance whatsoever, and has nothing to do with the 
financial or other powers and functions of the organisation.

<F P=106> [By David Wallen, Doreen Cheung, and So Lai-Fun] </F>
  [Text] Sir Percy Cradock last night joined the barrage of 
denials by British and Hong Kong officials of any secret 
diplomatic understanding with China that borrowings for the 
airport and railway projects would be lumped together as 
government debts. Instead, Sir Percy specifically stated from 
London: "There was no secret undertaking in the Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU), no protocol in which we agreed on public 
debt. I did not sign any secret deal nor enter into agreements 
on such issues." 
  Britain's denial enflamed a dispute with Lu Ping China's top 
Hong Kong man, who claimed the existence of such an 
understanding in setting a $5 billion limit on airport-related 
debt to run beyond 1997. Mr Lu, the director of Chinese State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, told the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) on Thursday [27 January] 
that he and Sir Percy, former foreign affairs adviser to Prime 
Minister John Major, had struck a deal in June last year. 
  Yesterday, Mr Lu stood firm behind China's position and 
criticised the British remarks, which he said amounted to 
opening new issues and violated the MOU. Mr Lu challenged the 
British side to go ahead now to borrow money for building the 
Chek Lap Kok airport and the railway project in the absence of 
China's consent. "If the British side thinks...the loans raised 
by the PAA [Provisional Airport Authority] and the MTRC [Mass 
Transit Railway Corporation] are not covered by $5 billion 
ceiling on Government debt, then there is really no need for 
them to discuss with the Chinese side. 
  "They can simply go ahead to borrow money. But we will thank 
God if they can raise the funds," said Mr Lu. 
  The British Foreign Office and Hong Kong Government issued 
separate statements, denying China's claim that there was an 
understanding on what borrowings were included in the Government 
debt written into the MOU. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish 
Macleod said the Government was "astonished" by Mr Lu's 
statement. The Foreign Office statement said: "There is no 
truth in these allegations." 
  The renewed bickering comes as top Hong Kong officials 
offered to put forward a fourth financing package addressing 
China's concerns when the Joint Liaison Group Airport Committee 
meets again. Chief Secretary Mrs Anson Chan Fang On-sang would 
not say what the package contained, but it was expected to be a 
further substantial increase in the Government's capital 
injection. 
  The previous offer was to pump $45.3 billion into the 
Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) and the Mass Transit Railway 
Corporation (MTRC). Recalling details of the airport talks on 
the MOU. Mr Lu said Britain had never mentioned the size of 
debts to be borne by the PAA and the MTRC. "If they had touched 
upon that (the size of PAA and MTRC debts), it would certainly 
had been clearly stated in the MOU," he said after a meeting of 
the PWC political sub-group. 
  The Foreign Office statement said: "The text of the MOU 
makes clear that the Hong Kong Government will be free to borrow 
as necessary, while informing the Chinese Government of 
borrowings up to HK$5 billion. 
  "This clause refers only to borrowings by the Hong Kong 
Government, not borrowings by the MTRC or the PAA. 
  "During Sir Percy Cradock's negotiations with the Chinese 
Government which led to the MOU there was no discussion about 
extending the reference to the Hong Kong Government in this 
clause to cover also the MTRC and the PAA. 
  "We and the Hong Kong Government continue to attach 
importance to reaching agreement with the Chinese on airport 
financing including borrowing by the PAA and MTRC." 
  Expressing astonishment of the report Mr Macleod questioned 
why such an understanding should suddenly come out from a 
Chinese official. "It seems strange that this reported secret 
understanding has not been mentioned before, neither in public 
nor in private, during the two-and-a-half years that have 
elapsed since the MOU was published." 
  He cited the former Governor Sir David Wilson's words on the 
document: "I mean all has been agreed is here on that piece of 
paper (the MOU) in front of you, nothing in addition to that at 
all." 
  Sir Hamish said the $5 billion debt ceiling was agreed at 
the 
same time China requested an assurance that the reserves to be 
left for the future Special Administrative Region would not be 
less than $25 billion. 
  "Both sides realised that, without a limit on Hong Kong 
Government borrowing, this would be meaningless because it would 
leave the Hong Kong Government free to borrow enough to make the 
reserves up to $25 billion. [no closing quotation marks as

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Running Out of Airport Options"] </F>
  [Text] From the sublime to the ridiculous. First came the 
accusation of a secret deal, which is now said not to exist. 
Then, yesterday a bizarre dispute erupted over a change of name. 
  Given these developments over the past few days, the casual 
observer could be forgiven for thinking that the long-running 
dispute over funding of the Chek Lap Kok airport project has 
turned into something of a farce. 
  Both sides must share some of the responsibility. The 
Government certainly seems to have paid too little attention to 
the debt issue which was the cause of the most recent war of 
words. 
  When Executive Councillor Edward Chen Kwan-yiu accurately 
predicted last summer that a dispute would arise precisely over 
the definition of government debt, Financial Secretary Sir 
Hamish Macleod promptly shot such a notion down. 
  At the time, Mr Chen warned that China would insist debts 
incurred by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and Airport 
Corporation be included in the $5 billion limit laid down in the 
Memorandum of Understanding on the new project. Mr Macleod, as 
he was then, denied this, saying there was no reason to make 
such a presumption. 
  Perhaps the administration also under-estimated the 
difficulty of explaining the difference between government debt, 
and that of its statutory corporations, to Chinese officials 
unused to drawing such fine distinctions over the financial 
liabilities of their own companies. 
  Whatever the faults of the Hong Kong administration, the 
events of the past few days clearly show that the greater blame 
must lie on the Chinese side. First, there was Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office chief Lu Ping's claim of a secret deal over 
the definition of government debt--which the vehemence of 
subsequent British denials strongly suggest was a fabrication. 
  Perhaps Mr Lu thought he could pull a fast one, by claiming 
to have reached an agreement with Sir Percy Cradock, the one 
British official who has since broken ranks with his 
government's policy. He calculated badly, judging from the speed 
with which Sir Percy issued a denial. 
  Then came yesterday's absurd allegation that Britain had 
changed the name of the Airport Authority to Airport 
Corporation, simply to avoid consulting China over its debt. 
Absurd because the Government has already told Beijing it is 
happy to use whichever title it likes. 
  Such outbursts suggest that China is more interested in 
placing obstacles on the flight path to Chek Lap Kok than in 
seeing it built. This can only cast doubt on the sincerity of 
its commitment to separate the airport from political issues. 
There was a time, late last year, when the Chinese did seem 
genuinely committed to the Chek Lap Kok project, even signalling 
approval for some steps that were necessary, just as the 
political reform talks broke down. But the events of the past 
few days have shattered any such illusions. 
  The Government has few options. Some argue the 
administration should abandon its seemingly-endless wait for 
Chinese approval, and simply go-it-alone, loans and all. While 
that may sound tempting in some sectors, it would breach the 
Memorandum of Understanding where consultation between both 
sides is crucial. 
  Similarly, privatisation, while superficially attractive, 
can 
only further enrage Beijing, which has already expressed concern 
about the project slipping out of Government control. 
  With those two options not without problems, the Government 
has little choice but to proceed with its present piecemeal 
approach of continuing to seek funds when needed from the 
legislature while seeking to reach an overall agreement on 
funding from China. It may not be a pleasant option, but the 
hard reality is that there is no real alternative course of 
action.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Governor Chris Patten by political </F>
editor Danny Gittings; place and date not given: "The Next 
Three Years"] 
  [Text] The future mayor of Hong Kong sat back in his 
arm-chair and made light of the latest airport project salvoes 
being fired from over the border. Governor Chris Patten, to use 
his present -- and more familiar -- title, was 
characteristically forthright in dismissing claims there was a 
1991 deal over airport-related debt. "It's extraordinary that 
this allegation has come out after 2 1/2 years," he said. "If 
Chinese officials are actually saying that there is a secret 
deal, they should come out and say that for themselves. But, of 
course there wasn't." 
  But these are the sort of comments he will be unlikely to be 
saying by the end of next year, as the Governor attempts to fade 
away into the background, and adopt a role more like that of a 
municipal leader. "It is right and proper that, the closer we 
get to 1997, the more I should take a back seat, the less I 
should take a prominent political role, and the more I should 
try to ensure that public servants locally, and politicians 
locally, are making, running and setting the agenda," he said. 
  Although it is strange to hear such an upfront leader 
contemplate taking a low-profile role, Mr Patten insists he knew 
this would be his fate ever since he arrived, and dismisses 
suggestions it may make him a touch irrelevant. "I shall very 
much enjoy being mayor of Hong Kong and look forward to seeing 
through the agenda which I first sketched in the autumn of 
1992," he said. "I've always assumed that, as would have 
happened with governors in other situations, where it wasn't a 
question of the transfer of sovereignty but a granting of 
independence, that the closer you get, as it were, to D-day, the 
more time you spend in the back seat of the car." 
  Whether Mr Patten will get his low-profile wish, given the 
probability agreement will not be reached on political reform, 
and the likelihood of continued Sino-British hostilities, is 
another matter. The Governor insisted none of the bad sentiment 
had influenced his plans to step back from the political arena 
after the 1995 polls. But he agreed recent Chinese comments had 
badly affected morale in the civil service, which is expected to 
take up the responsibility Mr Patten intends to relinquish. 
"There have been quite a lot of things said by Chinese 
officials which I don't think have helped civil service morale 
and I sometimes wonder whether some Chinese officials actually 
understand what the traditions of our public service amount to," 
he said. 
  But the Governor reiterated the British belief that, despite 
the public dispute, senior mainland officials, such as Hong Kong 
and Macau Affairs Office chief Lu Ping, fully realised the need 
to safeguard the stability of the civil service. Mr Patten's 
plan to step back may also be one solution to having a governor 
who is unable to talk to China, by allowing others -- such as 
Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang On-sang, who last week dined 
privately with local XINHUA (the New China News Agency) chief 
Zhou Nan -- to fill the vacuum. 
  Indeed the Governor now seems relatively relaxed at the 
prospect of being unable to reach Mr Lu by phone or have any 
direct contact with the Chinese in the final years of the 
transition. While saying he still hoped such contacts would 
eventually prove possible, Mr Patten noted many of his 
predecessors had faced the same situation, and there were plenty 
of contacts at lower levels. "For years, Hong Kong governors 
weren't able to deal directly and there was a lot less contact 
than there is today. There's a huge amount of contact between 
our officials and Chinese officials...a great deal of business 
is transacted and even more will be transacted between now and 
1997," he said. 
  Mr Patten was equally relaxed about the practical problems 
of 
organising the 1994-95 polls in the face of Chinese opposition. 
It is possible, with Beijing likely to declare their results 
null and void, some candidates may decide not to stand, and 
there may be an even lower voter turnout than usual. But, even 
if that produced a turnout rate still worse than the 
disappointing 39 per cent recorded during the hotly-contested 
1991 polls, Mr Patten did not think it would cast a shadow over 
the elections -- noting how turnout was even lower in the US and 
some British polls. 
  They are hypothetical considerations that very soon may 
become reality, with the Governor dropping strong hints that the 
tabling of a further -- third stage -- bill on political reform, 
which will mean finally giving up trying to restart 
negotiations, is now close to a certainty. 
  Mr Patten stressed that, while he still wanted further 
talks, the ball was effectively in China's court. Britain would 
not take any sort of initiative -- such as further letters at 
prime ministerial level -- to try to lure them back to the 
negotiating table, beyond the routine diplomatic contacts that 
have so far failed to yield any results. "The Chinese have 
walked away from the table. We'd like them to walk back, but I 
don't know of any special initiative or special deal we could 
offer them in order to trigger talks," he said. 
  Even if talks did restart, they could not last for long. "We 
have to try for a much more express version of negotiation," the 
Governor said. "Everybody realises that if talks were to 
resume, which, I repeat, I would like to see, they couldn't drag 
on for round after round, for month after month." And -- 
answering a question he has evaded in the past -- Mr Patten said 
the agenda for further negotiations could not include the 
contents of the first-stage bill, on so-called issues such as 
the voting age: "The partial bill...is on its way now and is 
not going to be delayed or taken off the track." 
  Even the content, and rough timing, of a third-stage bill 
seems pretty much decided. Although a formal and final decision 
has yet to be taken, the Governor added to the growing body of 
opinion that he will plump for his original October 1992 
package, by noting the support it had attracted in the 
Legislative Council [Legco], while expressing some sympathy for 
the criticisms of the July 1993 compromise proposals. "When 
Legco has expressed a view on the 1992 package in the past, it 
has done so positively and enthusiastically on all three 
occasions, but I think you have to take the temperature on the 
day," he said. 
  On the July 1993 conditional concessions, Mr Patten said he 
"can see the strength of the argument" of those who say they 
should now be put aside since "you didn't get a through train, 
you didn't get an agreement on anything, apart from the voting 
age. You made all these substantial concessions and there's no 
deal." 
  Even on the timing of any new bill, options are clearly 
limited, with the Governor noting that time is running short, if 
the Government is to meet its July deadline for having all 
electoral arrangements in place. Indeed it is further 
constrained by the budget, which eats up three otherwise 
available dates for introducing a political reform bill to the 
Legislative Council before the Easter recess. "The Budget is a 
factor in deciding when to bring in the third bill," he said. 
"It takes up a good deal of time because we need some time for 
the council to debate the good news about Hong Kong's 
economy...it affects the amount of time you've got before Easter 
if you want to do it (introduce the bill) before Easter." 
  The Governor's reluctance to take any new initiative to try 
to resume negotiations on the political front is in stark 
contrast to the situation with the airport, where he is dangling 
concessions in front of the Chinese in an effort to bring them 
back to the negotiating table. "To demonstrate our flexibility 
we can put constructive proposals on the table," he said. 
"We've been in a difficulty since last summer because there 
have been questions about land premium which we would have liked 
to have resolved in the land commission. But, as a 
demonstration of our constructiveness, we will, I think, be able 
to develop our proposals in the Airport Committee straight away." 
  But, even here, there is a baseline beyond which Mr Patten 
will not go. "I'm not going to make decisions about funding 
which would be unwise and unreasonable to the Hong Kong taxpayer 
in order to try to bring things forward by a week or two," he 
said. "People sometimes say `pour in all the money's that 
necessary, to make sure there's an airport before you go'. I 
don't think the people of Hong Kong would regard that as very 
sound public administration. We should proceed as sensibly and 
carefully as we can." There is more than a hint of weariness 
too: "The documents on the airport make, I would guess, the 
documents which went into setting up the United Nations look 
like a short story."

  [Text] Outgoing Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, 
Michael Sze Cho-cheung, said yesterday he would have no regrets 
if his support for political reform cost him his job after 1997. 
Speaking on the day that he stepped down from the 
constitutional post, a hot seat which made him a constant target 
for mainland criticism, Mr Sze said he had a clear conscience 
about everything he had done. He played down the personal 
attack on him by top Chinese official Lu Ping. 
  Mr Lu, the Director of Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office, questioned Mr Sze's legitimacy to 
represent the people of Hong Kong at the British parliamentary 
Foreign Affairs Select Committee hearing. Mr Lu said: "How 
many people in Hong Kong regard this `loyal' follower (of 
Patten) as a Hong Kong person?" 
  But Mr Sze said yesterday that he had never claimed to 
represent Hong Kong people at the meeting. "But I am a Hong 
Kong person. I have a Hong Kong identity card, and I am a 
permanent resident here. I have a clear conscience, and it is 
perfectly legitimate that I say that I am a Hong Kong person," 
he said. 
  Mr Sze said the criticisms levelled against him did not 
bother him because he believed he was only doing his duty as a 
civil servant. "I think I have done nothing against my 
conscience, and I will continue to try my best to fulfill my 
duty as a civil servant. 
  "I believe that. after 1997, the central Government and the 
Special Administrative Region (SAR) government will also want 
their civil servants to have the same work attitude instead of 
having officers looking over their shoulders while doing their 
work." 
  Asked how he would feel if his comments led to him being out 
of a job after 1 997, Mr Sze said: "I wouldn't feel it's such a 
pity. I will continue to try my best to fulfill my duty. 
  "From now to 1997, there are more than 1,200 days. There's a 
saying that a week is a long time in politics, and I think 1,200 
days is a very, very long time indeed," said Mr Sze. 
  He said the attack on former executive councillor Sir 
Sze-yuen Chung by patriarch Deng Xiaoping in the early 1980s was 
much more serious than that against him. "If the attack on Sir 
Sze-yuen was equivalent to typhoon signal No 10, mine is just 
about No 3. Now Sir Sze-yuen is highly regarded by both the 
Chinese Government and the Hong Kong administration." 
  Mr Sze takes up the post as Secretary for the Civil Service 
on Tuesday. He will be succeeded by Nicholas Ng Wing-fui. Mr 
Sze said it was important the Government soon begin to discuss 
with China the arrangements for top officials to serve beyond 
1997. 
  Turning to the 1994-95 elections, Mr Sze said he felt 
frustrated that he was not able to see the partial electoral 
bill through the Legislative Council [Legco] before stepping 
down as constitutional chief. It is expected that the remainder 
of the bill will be tabled to Legco on March 9 at the earliest, 
but Mr Sze declined to confirm that. Instead, he noted that the 
tabling of the rest of the bill would be an extremely difficult 
task. He also declined to be specific on which version of the 
electoral package would be tabled to legislators.

That Britain's Unfriendly and Uncooperative Attitude Cannot But

  [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan (WEN WEI PO)--In discussing 
Sino-British economic and trade relations today, Wu Yi, minister 
of foreign economic cooperation and trade, said: "The 
unfriendly and uncooperative stand taken by Britain on the Hong 
Kong issue will definitely affect Sino-British economic and 
trade relations. This is not what we wish to see, and the 
responsibility does not lie with the Chinese side." 
  It has been learned that the total volume of Sino-British 
trade reached $3.59 billion last year, an increase of 86 percent 
over the previous year. Judging from the general situation, Wu 
Yi continued, Sino-British economic and trade relations are not 
bad, and there is great potential for development. 
  Wu Yi made these remarks at a news conference held by the 
State Council's Information Office today.

  [Text] China's major policy branch on Hong Kong affairs 
plans to boost manpower and promote younger leaders in the face 
of growing workloads concerning the 1997 handover. Sources 
close to the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) said 
that existing manpower was stretched to the limit yet the scope 
of their work had become wider in view of political and economic 
changes. 
  "We need to increase manpower. But it has become more 
difficult to get the right people. We do want to have some Hong 
Kong people joining us. But given the pay scale in the Chinese 
Government, that is virtually impossible," one source said. 
  The First Department - in charge of economic matters - 
monitors a wide spectrum of issues such as the mammoth Chek Lap 
Kok plan; China-funded enterprises in Hong Kong and their 
listing plans; and infrastructure plans in the Pearl River Delta 
area, including border traffic. 
  The Second Department, whose duties are political affairs 
and 
civil service, is also faced with a heavy workload that covers a 
series of constitutional and legal problems arising over the 
changeover. 
  The office under the State Council, and headed by Director 
Lu Ping, has four major departments with little more than 100 
staff members. 
  The manpower shortage has been worsened by the need to 
deploy 
staff at the Beijing office of the Preliminary Working Committee 
(PWC) formed a few months ago to give assistance to the working 
body doing research and administrative work. A source said: 
"Some HKMAO officials have had two offices: One in the HKMAO 
headquarters and the other in the PWC office. There's no other 
way out in the meantime, unless there are additional staff." 
Officials, however, refused to say how many people they needed 
to recruit. 
  Another difficulty was trying to seek more staff in the face 
of the ongoing drive by Beijing to trim a bloated bureaucracy. 
Moreover, sources said a senior-level reshuffle was imminent 
following the transfer of vice-director Mr Wang Qiren to the 
Bank of China and the retirement of an "old Hong Kong hand," Mr 
Luo Jiahuan, who is a Joint Liaison Group (JLG) member. 
  Mr Wang's post, which has been left vacant for months, will 
be taken by Wang Fengchao, head of the Second Department. 
  His deputy, Xu Ze, is set for promotion to head of 
department. 
  Mr Luo, 66, will retire from the JLG office soon and be 
succeeded by Chen Zuo'er, who is head of the First Department. 
  Mr Chen has participated in secret negotiations on the Chek 
Lap Kok airport plan and is expected to sit on the Airport 
Committee after he is posted to the territory. 
  Mr Xu and Mr Zhang, deputy department heads, have worked in 
the HKMAO since the early 1980s. In their late 30s, the pair 
are seen as rising stars in the HKMAO. 
  Another source said the rapid promotion of the younger 
officers was also because the HKMAO was a less attractive part 
of the Chinese bureaucracy.

  [Text] Macao, January 29 (XINHUA) -- Macao and the United 
States have signed a 2-year extension of their textile and 
garment trade agreement, according to Macao Government 
Information Services. 
  The agreement related to their bilateral trade in cotton, 
wool, and man-made fibre textiles and textile products. 
  The accord was signed in Washington Friday [28 January]. 
  The textile agreement contains the liberalization of various 
products, and the possibility of growth in non-traditional 
categories. The agreement also removes all quantitative limits 
to textile imports from Macao, aside from wool items. 
  A press communique issued by the Macao Government stresses 
that the extended agreement offers better access to the U.S. 
market not only for garment products but also for woven fabrics. 
  The U.S. has and continued to be Macao's prime export 
market. 
During the first ten months last year, the U.S. absorbed 33.7 
percent of Macao's total export volume, which stood at 3.9 
billion Macao patacas (about 487 million U.S. dollars).

<F P=106> [New Year address by President Suharto on 31 December; place </F>
not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God the Most Compassionate and Most 
Merciful! My fellow countrymen! Peace be upon you all! 
  We will leave 1993 in a few moments and enter the new year 
1994. As in previous years, I would like to ask for your time on 
the eve of the new year to recall and consider together the 
significance of 1993 for the life and development of our nation. 
With a clear mind, let us draw valuable lessons from all events 
and experience throughout the year that will end soon! Let us 
wisely use the lesson as an asset to continue our journey as a 
nation! 
  We feel very happy for being able to leave 1993 with a sigh 
of relief and self-confidence. Thus, we will welcome 1994 with 
high hopes and spirits to continue our national struggle. 
Important domestic and foreign events that will have 
far-reaching implications on the coming decades occurred in 
1993. We will leave 1993 by thanking God for allowing us to 
enjoy calm throughout the year. In other parts of the world, 
nations are suffering from disputes with others and internal 
upheavals, or are in the process of achieving national 
stability. We live in a changing world full of problems, 
challenges, and open opportunities. 
  My fellow countrymen! The General Congress of the People's 
Consultative Assembly [MPR] was held successfully and safely 
this year. This was a manifestation of our determination to 
consistently implement Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. The 
MPR issued a broad new outline of state policies that not only 
sets targets for the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan, but also 
a new national strategy for the country over the next 25 years. 
As a nation, we are determined to have a better future -- 
better than what we have already achieved. We are determined to 
promote our living standards, quality, and dignity. We will 
continue to develop our country to attain our aspirations. The 
government and people must make serious preparations to ensure 
that development programs in the coming years will achieve the 
desired results. We should continue to revamp the civil service 
and improve its services to the government. Efforts will 
continue to make the civil servants more effective, efficient, 
cohesive, and receptive to the people's dynamism, aspirations, 
and interests. The people in general and sociopolitical and 
mass organizations in particular should also undertake equally 
intensive efforts. The success of our future national 
development plans will depend primarily on the participation of 
the people. Accordingly, political communication between the 
people and their leaders -- public figures and people's deputies 
-- should be maintained consistently. There must be continuous 
and sincere political communication between the deputies and 
sociopolitical forces and the people in their respective 
constituencies. 
  Ladies and gentlemen! After two and a half decades, we now 
give a sigh of relief for having established a solid foundation 
for development. Subsequently, we will enter the takeoff period 
a few months from now. 
  Ideologically and politically, we have revamped our 
political 
institutions in accordance with Pancasila and the 1945 
Constitution. Democracy continues to grow. We are responsibly 
and cautiously developing openness. We now have the National 
Commission for Human Rights that will work independently. The 
commission will promote the universal and national concepts of 
human rights and monitor the implementation of human rights in 
the country. All this will freshen our quality of life and 
energize our national stability. 
  Let us take a look at economic issues. We registered high 
economic growth in 1993, while the inflation rate was kept below 
10 percent. The volume and number of our exports increased. We 
consolidated our self-sufficency in rice, in addition to 
boosting agricultural development in general. Industrial 
progress was evident in the growing contribution of the 
industrial sector to economic development and export revenue. 
Trade, communications, tourism, and other sectors continued to 
make remarkable progress. Our economic progress has become all 
the more important in view of our past efforts to cool our 
overheating economy. We have developed many ideas and spent 
energy, time, and money to achieve the current level of 
progress. The government will continue to encourage our 
economic forces to play a dynamic role in development. We have 
achieved satisfactory progress in the sociocultural, defense, 
and security sectors. 
  We have achieved all this thanks to our solid political 
(?system), national resilience, and the success of development 
programs in all fields. Development and growth achieved through 
the end of 1993 has strengthened our conviction that a 
transition to the takeoff period will be smooth, calm, and 
orderly. It is this conviction that encourages us to welcome 
1994. From 1994 onward, there will be challenges and hope. We 
must satisfy various increasing aspirations and needs. We must 
eradicate the poverty that plagues some of us. We must catch up 
with other nations that are already ahead of us. We live in the 
Asia-Pacific region, which has registered the fastest economic 
growth in the world over the past two decades. APEC 
[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] has opened new 
opportunities. We must also be prepared for a new international 
trade system arising from the 1994 [as heard] GATT pact. 
Whether we will be able to exploit these opportunities for our 
own progress will depend on our own national strength. We must 
expand our economy further. Economic institutions, be they 
state enterprises, private companies, or cooperatives, should 
revamp themselves to enable our nation to compete with other 
nations economically. 
  My fellow countrymen! We regard 1993 as an important year 
because we will soon end the first 25-year long-term development 
scheme and enter a new era, which is the takeoff period, in 
1994. By working hard, maintaining national unity and cohesion, 
and energizing national stability, let us enter 1994 with high 
hopes and strong determination! 
  We wish you all a happy 1994 and a Merry Christmas to all 
Christians! May God the Most Compassionate and Most Merciful 
always bless all of us! Thank you and peace be upon you again!

  [Text] BANGKOK, Dec 31 (AFP) -- About 1,000 Burmese 
troops and rebels of the Karen National Union have been involved 
in fierce fighting for the past 48 hours near the Thai border, a 
Karen spokesman said here Friday. 
  Troops of Burma's ruling State Law and Order Council (SLORC) 
"resumed their offensive against the Karen National Union on 
December 29," said KNU spokesman Arthur Shwe. He described the 
clashes as "fierce." "Casualties on both sides are not yet 
known," he said. 
  The fighting resumed as an attempt this month at political 
dialogue between the SLORC and opposition groups appeared to 
have aborted, political analysts said. 
  Burmese troops launched their assault on KNU positions 
around 
Saw Hta, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of Mannerplaw, 
the Karen headquarters and that of the Burmese opposition in 
exile, bordering Thailand. 
  It is the first major offensive ordered by the SLORC since 
January and is spearheaded by light infantry battalions 319 and 
314 and No. 227 Regiment, said the Karen spokesman. It involves 
around 1,000 men, said Shwe. 
  "Fighting was still going on last night" said the spokesman 
who was receiving information from Mannerplaw. 
  The Karens, the second largest ethnic group after the 
Burmese, are mostly Christians and have been fighting for 
independence from Rangoon since 1947 when the former British 
colony became independent. 
  Concentrated largely in the south-east of the country, the 
Karens control large tracts of territory along the Thai border 
area. 
  In November the Burma Democratic Alliance, which groups 
about 
20 opposition movements, met in Mannerplaw and agreed to try a 
dialogue with the SLORC. 
  But the SLORC refused to talk through the alliance and said 
it would only dialogue with the opposition movements 
individually.

<F P=106> [By Nuraina Samad] </F>
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Fri [31 December] -- Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed said Malaysians must not run away from 
challenges facing the country and warned them not to make greed 
and excessive personal wants the driving force for moving ahead. 
  The Prime Minister said the country would progress further 
if 
the people adopted a moderate approach, were not greedy and 
careful in their outlook. 
  Dr. Mahathir said Malaysia was successful because its people 
had not forgotten their struggle and objectives. He said this 
in his New Year message over Radio and Television Malaysia 
tonight. 
  The Prime Minister said the peace, stability, prosperity and 
progress now enjoyed by Malaysians did not come by accident. 
Much of it was the result of hard work and co-operation from 
all sides -- the rakyat [people], Government, workers and 
entrepreneurs. 
  The concentration of efforts by everyone had helped Malaysia 
achieve encouraging performance in all fields throughout 1993, 
he said. 
  Dr. Mahathir said societies in any country wished for 
prosperity. This led to the creation of numerous theories and 
ideologies like socialism and communism as well as a welfare 
state system. 
  Wanting to have equality among the people is good but these 
ideologies do not take into account the human consideration. 
  "Equality among us exists only at birth, when we are all 
clean of any sins. Whether or not we succeed to become decent 
human beings when we grow up depends on our attitude and efforts. 
  "Others can help us. The Government can help us but in the 
end, what will bring us success is our own effort." 
  Dr. Mahathir said this was why the people could not hope for 
society or the Government to provide all the facilities as 
promised by a western-style welfare state. 
  He said: "Having only one section of the people working hard 
and with full responsibility while others who have less work and 
responsibility enjoy similar wages is not a sound practice. 
  "If everyone is given equal benefits, no one will want to 
carry a heavy task. And there is no way to make work equally 
light." 
  Dr. Mahathir said attempts to provide an equal salary for 
different types of jobs would only obstruct progress. 
  "A country that does not progress and prosper will not be 
able to provide a good life for its people. What is easy to 
divide equally is poverty and a hard life." 
  A welfare state which depends on the forces of law will not 
succeed as one, which is why they, along with the communist and 
socialist states, are facing declining economies. 
  "But this does not mean that welfare states cannot exist at 
all. They can if the people who are capable and efficient are 
allowed to freely seek wealth. 
  "If a society has caring qualities and is always ready to 
donate to those in need, then a welfare state can exist. But 
the intention is not for those less fortunate to be as rich as 
the donors. 
  "The intention is to help those who have not succeeded, for 
whatever reason." 
  If this happens, then the gap between the poor and the rich 
would not be too wide, he said. 
  The Government would still have a role in a welfare state. 
It would impose taxes on the rich to help finance facilities 
which are used by all, he said. 
  But he pointed out that the taxes should not be too high 
that 
they would demoralise those who can increase their wealth. 
  "Those efficient in seeking wealth are useful to the welfare 
of society and country. Without them, or as in the communist 
countries where they are not allowed to amass wealth, there will 
be no one from whom the Government can collect taxes which could 
be utilised in the public's interest." 
  Dr. Mahathir said the theory that the Government could carry 
out business and reap all the profits and not just a part of it 
through taxes was baseless. 
  Businesses carried out by a government often face losses, 
especially if all its members and staff are paid equally as 
suggested by communism and socialism. 
  Moreover, the government bureaucratic system limits 
management from acting as a business operator. As such profits 
are difficult to obtain. 
  "The experience in Malaysia is that government companies 
need 
the government's help all the time." 
  Dr. Mahathir said government-owned companies often faced 
demands for pay hikes and threats of strikes from its workers. 
  "If the demands are not entertained, there is a possibility 
that the Government will not get the support when a general 
election is held. On the other hand, by entertaining the 
demands, losses will be greater or the prices of goods will 
increase. 
  "The Government's income will be reduced and it cannot 
finance supply for public interest," he said. 
  The Prime Minister said the Government, on the other hand, 
cannot seek excessive profits. Therefore, the Government as a 
business owner cannot pay good salaries to its employees. 
  "With a low pay, the people working with the government in a 
western welfare-style state, cannot afford expensive goods which 
normally give higher profits." 
  Dr. Mahathir drew attention to Malaysia's unique philosophy 
in which all sides are given suitable freedom because the 
Government believes that everyone -- from manual workers to 
businessmen, investors, politicians and managers, had a role to 
play. 
  "They each have a different role but they all contribute to 
progress," he said. 
  Dr. Mahathir spoke of the rise of communism and socialism in 
the West during a time when investors, once regarded as highly 
important, became so greedy that they did not value the role of 
workers and managers. 
  But he cautioned that a communist and socialist society in 
which workers were given too much emphasis would not bring 
success and fairness. 
  Today, Dr. Mahathir said, the Western societies were putting 
too much value on managers who are believed to hold the key in 
the success of a business or operation. 
  Because of this, the managers demanded very high salaries 
with bonuses and share option schemes and all sorts of perks. 
  In Malaysia, a similar approach was developing. Managers 
were demanding high salaries and perks. He said that there had 
been instances when managers were demanding wages and other 
benefits valued at almost RM [Malaysian ringgit] 2 million a 
year. 
  He said it was this kind of a greedy approach that led to 
the 
big corporate giants in the United States to decline. They 
placed so much emphasis on quick profits that they did not 
invest in research and development or expansion. 
  The Prime Minister said: "We must remember that we all have 
a role to play. Whether we are manual labourers or owners of 
companies whether we are in the public or private sector, no one 
can consider himself more important that he does not depend on 
others. 
  "Big or small, we all have our roles to play. Therefore, we 
should place a value and appreciate every effort fairly."

<F P=106> ["Message" from His Majesty King Sihanouk in Beijing General </F>
Hospital; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Beloved brothers, children, grandchildren, and great 
grandchildren; venerable monks headed by the Supreme Patriarchs 
Pouthiveang and Khousananda, wisemen, and nuns: 
  I would like to address this message to all of you. I would 
like all of you to know that I think about and love you very 
much. I do hope that on the occasion of our traditional New 
Year in April, I will be able to come back to be with you as 
before and to work together in order to build and defend the 
country in an atmosphere of mutual love, mutual trust, and 
mutual care as brothers in our great Cambodian family. 
  I was very happy to receive the delegation, with Samdech 
Chea 
Sim as its chairman and His Excellency [H.E.] Heng Samrin as its 
deputy chairman, which just visited me (?on behalf of) the 
nation and people. I and the queen miss our motherland and all 
our children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren very much. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that the 
great Chinese friends have given me the best help. They have 
given our Cambodia, me and my family, and our people great 
friendship and genuine fraternity since time immemorial, now, 
and in the future. Moreover, this cancer treatment has been 
successful thanks to their efforts in scientific, technical, 
material, and all other fields. They have worked very 
meticulously and flawlessly, giving me good care (?so that) I 
will live longer to serve our Cambodian motherland. [Words 
indistinct] they said it would be completed (?this month). The 
reaction was good, there has been no difficulty. Many patients 
who are much younger than I am have suffered a bad effect after 
the third and fourth stages of the treatment because the 
medicine for curing cancer is very strong. This strong medicine 
causes the patient to lose strength, experience nausea, and have 
a headache or other bad effects. The great Chinese friends, 
however, have sought special Chinese traditional medicine for 
me. These doctors have tried to find medicine for dealing with 
this disease according to each step of its condition. Moreover, 
they have bought modern medicine from abroad, such as the newly 
developed American drugs, to cure me as soon as possible so that 
I can return to our motherland. 
  It is expected that I will be able to return home in April, 
the month that we mark our traditional new year. Only two more 
phases of treatment are needed, that is, the fifth and sixth 
phases. After the sixth phase, there will be a recess of nearly 
a month in order to check results. After that, it seems that I 
will be allowed to leave. 
  (?In conclusion), I would like to tell you that I am quite 
concerned about some problems facing you, brothers, children, 
grandchildren, and great grandchildren. I have read our 
national newspapers, which my son-in-law, (Keo Put-reaksmei), 
sends me every week. Therefore, I have learned about all the 
big, medium, and small problems facing you. I would like to 
share all the woes you are facing. I always share your weal and 
woe and as our saying goes: Always share weal and woe together. 
My heart and soul always stay close to Cambodia, to all 
children and grandchildren, and to all venerables. 
  Samdech Chea Sim, our National Assembly chairman who is the 
acting head of state when I am not in the Kingdom of Cambodia, 
and H.E. Heng Samrin have made reports to me [words indistinct]. 
I would like to commend all patriotic children and 
grandchildren for always having good intentions toward our 
motherland, for bravely and patiently enduring all the 
shortcomings, and for working hard with all your strength and 
wisdom to serve the motherland and the livelihood of your 
families. This makes all of you worthy of being citizens of our 
independent and sovereign kingdom. 
  I would like to tell you that I am satisfied with your 
decision to serve the rights and freedoms of our children and 
grandchildren in line with our Constitution; that is, our 
people's rights as the masters of our land, water [words 
indistinct]. Children and grandchildren (?have the) rights and 
freedoms [words indistinct] use policy of nonviolence. This 
means that there should be no quarrels, arguments, nor danger to 
the nation. The only question of violence is that with the 
Khmer Rouge, who have not yet understood that nonviolent policy. 
Except for the Khmer Rouge, our entire nation understands the 
need to use nonviolent methods -- that is, peaceful means -- in 
all circumstances. Therefore, I (?hope that) all children will 
be able to avoid serious disaster by using peaceful means and 
they will follow the appeal I made in various messages. [Words 
indistinct] with our National Assembly, government, various 
ministries and departments, and our soldiers. This is because 
they belong to all children and grandchildren, to all Cambodian 
people. Whether they are called the royal government or 
whatever, they are your government, the Cambodian people's 
government. The government is called the royal government 
because our country is a kingdom. So, the word royal is added 
to everything just as in some countries like England. 
  This does not mean that the government serves only the 
king. It primarily serves the people. This is because the 
people own the vote and the power. Therefore, all children and 
grandchildren [words indistinct] peaceful means. I support you 
so long as it is a peaceful one. Demonstrations are a normal 
happening. It is [words indistinct]. In a liberal democratic 
system, demonstrations are regarded as ordinary happenings. 
Therefore, I support all of you in this undertaking so long as 
there is no (?violence), no bloodshed, no injury. All of this 
is no good. But your voicing opinions and asking for this and 
that are just ordinary things. They are good undertakings to 
arouse our government, our National Assembly, and our 
administration -- both civilian and military -- to always pay 
attention to you and your problems. 
  Concerning National Assembly members, [words indistinct] 
salaries, there will be problems. I know that there will be 
such problems. I told [words indistinct]. Now what I said was 
true [laughter]. Problems have taken place. Therefore, in my 
opinion, this matter must be resolved according to the majority 
of National Assembly members as well as the majority of citizens 
-- what do they want it to be; how do they want it to be? Do 
listen to them. As with the doctors who are giving me the 
treatment [words indistinct]. Therefore, I dare not say how 
much, to what extent should their salaries, their earnings, be. 
All I want to tell you is that you should listen to (?the 
majority). [Words indistinct] teachers, nurses, medics, 
professors, and (?youths) also have similar problem. Therefore, 
a cordial discussion, cordial contacts between our people and 
our National Assembly, our government, and the various 
ministries is a good thing. I would like all children and 
grandchildren to continue such contacts. 
  That is all the information I have for you. I pray to the 
Lord Buddha's Triple Gems to please protect the Supreme 
Patriarchs, patriarchs, venerable monks, brothers, children, 
grandchildren, and great grandchildren. May all of you always 
be blessed with longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, 
and enlightenment. Thank you. 
  (?This is my message) to the compatriots through Samdech 
Chea 
Sim, H.E. Heng Samrin, and all excellencies in the delegation.

  [Text] Report on the preparations for offensives against 
the Democratic Kampuchea [DK] liberated zone in a gross manner 
of the cat's-paws of the Vietnamese communists and their allies. 
  1. The king has advised all sides to meet, talk, and 
reconcile so as to move toward achieving peace in Cambodia and 
to build the national economy and people's livelihood. 
  2. Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian nation and people 
acclaim the king father's national reconciliation policy, 
support the king father's five-point political line, and keep 
persuading Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh to set up the 
technical group for communicating and discussing the national 
reconciliation issue, and so forth. 
  3. Hun Sen and the two-headed government keep calling for 
attacks to continue the war to smash the Khmer Rouge to pieces. 
This continued bellow by Hun Sen and the government with two 
heads and three eyes has resounded throughout the world. 
Various newspapers, news agencies, and radio-television 
broadcasts across the world have echoed this uproar by Hun Sen 
and his colleagues. 
  According to reports in various parts of the world, the two- 
headed government sent its co-ministers, Tie Banh and Tea 
Chamrat, to beg the Vietnamese communists' puppets in Laos to 
coordinate their attacks on the Khmer Rouge from Lao territory 
-- from the northern border. 
  4. The Cambodian nation and people and the world ask: Who 
is attacking whom? Is the war which is being kindled in 
Cambodia not the continuation of the Vietnamese communists' war 
of aggression? Is this an endeavor to solve the Cambodian 
problem so as to bring peace to Cambodia and enable Cambodian 
people to live peacefully or is it an attempt to kill the 
Cambodian nation and people and to destabilize the situation in 
the region? From where does this fuel to spark the war come? 
Does it come from the Cambodian people; or does it come from 
the Vietnamese communists, who are implementing their strategy 
to annex Cambodia, and from the idiotic allies who are serving 
the Vietnamese strategy? 
  5. Who are responsible for the current attempt to continue 
war in Cambodia? It is the Vietnamese communists and their 
allies. It is no-one else but the Vietnamese communists' 
People's Party with Hun Sen and Chea Sim as (?ringleaders) and 
the two-headed-three-eyed government which must be held fully 
responsible for the nation, people, the current and next 
generations to come, and history.

  [Excerpts] Aranyaprathet, Thailand, Dec 31 (AFP) -- A Khmer 
Rouge [KR] field commander Friday reported heavy artillery fire 
in Cambodian provinces along the border with Thailand, saying 
Phnom Penh was preparing a major offensive next week. 
  Khmer Rouge Lieutenant General Sok Peab told reporters at a 
border site 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Aranyaprathet of 
fighting in Battambang and Bantay Meanchey provinces. He said 
the Khmer Rouge had received word that the government was 
preparing a major offensive for January 5-7, coinciding with the 
1979 installation by Vietnam of a friendly government in Phnom 
Penh headed by Heng Samrin. 
  The government has brought up personnel, heavy arms and 
tanks 
for an offensive in the northern and eastern border provinces, 
but Khmer Rouge forces are ready to counter the offensive, Sok 
Peab said. [passage omitted] 
  Sok Peab reported fighting between Khmer Rouge and 
government 
forces in northeastern Cambodia, within 25 kilometers (15 miles) 
of the Thai border. Mortar and artillery fire could be heard at 
a great distance from the scene of the battles, he said. He gave 
no indication of casualties.

<F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>
  [Text] PHNOM PENH, Dec 31 (AFP) -- Some 2,000 government 
troops were gaining ground in the ongoing attack on the Khmer 
Rouge's headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern Cambodia, 
Minister of Information Ieng Muli said Friday. 
  "Our troops are getting closer and closer, the military 
pressure is working," Ieng Muli said, adding that he hoped the 
government troops would control the base within the next few 
days. The attack was a follow up to the offensive launched in 
central Kompong Thom province December 16 where government 
forces recaptured a number of Khmer Rouge bases. 
  The troops advanced from Kompong Thom towards Anlong Veng 
and 
now control almost half the area around the Khmer Rouge base 
which is the guerrilla faction's headquarters for all operations 
in north and central Cambodia. 
  The base was commanded by one-legged Khmer Rouge general Ta 
Mok, nicknamed "the butcher" because of his reputed cruelty when 
the Khmer Rouge was in power. He is now said to have fled 
Anlong Veng and set up a command base in Preah Vihear province 
where the Thai, Laotian and Cambodian borders meet. 
  Leng Sochea, an Information Ministry official, said the 
guerrillas had orders to break up into small groups to harass 
government forces and "to deploy as many landmines as possible." 
  A diplomat in the capital said the Khmer Rouge base would 
probably be empty when the government troops eventually took it. 
He said the government already faced major logistics problems 
in maintaining large numbers of troops in remote areas where 
access is difficult because of poor roads and landmines. 
  Meanwhile up to 100 Khmer Rouge attacked villages in the 
Choam Khsan district of Preah Vihear -- near Ta Mok's fall-back 
base -- on December 22, killing one villager and burning 30 
homes, a military report said. The guerrillas struck again in 
the same area the following day destroying a further 16 homes 
before being repelled by government troops. 
  The assault on Anlong Veng comes as Prince Norodom Ranariddh 
said he had agreed with Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan 
to form a working committee to discuss implementing peace 
proposals put forward by King Norodom Sihanouk. Asked why the 
government attack was going on when the two sides had agreed to 
talk, a senior government official said "it's normal. When you 
start to negotiate you have to put your weight in the military 
side also." 
  He said the Khmer Rouge had refused to observe a ceasefire 
before the talks. "So it's up to them now. If they agree a 
ceasefire there will be no fighting," he added.

  [Text] Aranyaprathet, Thailand, Jan 1 (AFP) -- Cambodian 
forces and Khmer Rouge guerrillas exchanged gun and mortar fire 
early New Year's Day after government troops attacked the 
faction's bases near the Thai border, a Thai army official here 
said. There was no immediate report of any casualties, the 
official said. Thai army and police at the border were placed 
on alert, he said. 
  The clash took place at Phoum Mahan, Phoum Malai and Dongsua 
Tai, about 20 kilometers (12 miles) south of Poipet, a Cambodian 
town on the other side of the border from Aranyaprathet, the 
official said. The incident was reported a day after Phnom Penh 
announced that it had launched a 2,000-troop assault on the 
Khmer Rouge's headquarters at Anlong Veng, on the northern 
Cambodian border with Thailand, about 180 kilometers (110 miles) 
northeast of Poipet. 
  The Khmer Rouge, blamed for the death of at least a million 
Cambodians during the 1970s, boycotted the U.N.-sponsored 
elections in Cambodia last year that saw the country become a 
constitutional monarchy under King Norodom Sihanouk. 
  The government has stepped up military pressure on the 
ultra-nationalist faction while at the same time promoting a 
peace initiative with it.

<F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>
  [Text] PHNOM PENH, Jan 2, (AFP) -- Co-premier Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh said Sunday the government and the Khmer Rouge 
[KR] had agreed on representatives to negotiate a peace 
proposal, yet fighting escalated in northwest Cambodia. 
  A working committee would consist of two cabinet ministers, 
Sok An from the Cambodian Peoples Party and Veng Sereivut from 
FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, 
Peaceful and Cooperative Cambodia], and Khmer Rouge officials 
Tep Khunnal and Chhuon Prasit, the prince said. 
  Sok An said he believed the meeting would take place soon, 
as 
the prince said the radical faction was eager to talk. But he 
admitted that despite the progress toward negotiations, fighting 
continued, although both sides were blaming the other as the 
aggressor. 
  "In some places the Khmer Rouge take the iniative to attack 
government positions and we have to defend ourselves," Sok An 
said. 
  Thai military officials however told a different story, 
saying government forces had attacked Khmer Rouge bases south of 
the border town of Poipet in the third consecutive day of 
clashes. 
  The information ministry acknowledged that government troops 
were still "keeping pressure" on the guerrillas in the area 
around the Khmer Rouge's headquarters at Anlong Veng in northern 
Siem Reap province. 
  "Our main aim is to defend government positions but that 
does 
not mean that we have to keep quiet. Sometimes we need to move 
first," Sok An said. 
  To be discussed by both sides is King Norodom Sihanouk's 
peace proposal, in which he suggests that "acceptable" Khmer 
Rouge members will be given senior cabinet posts if the 
guerrillas cease military activity, open their zones and merge 
their fighters with the national army. 
  During a recent clandestine meeting between Khmer Rouge 
nominal leader Khieu Samphan and Prince Ranariddh, both sides 
agreed to set up the working committee to discuss the 
implementation of the king's proposal. But the prince later 
questioned the rebel leader's sincerity, after Khieu Samphan 
would not first agree to a ceasefire. 
  "We are willing to end all problems by political means -- 
that's the government policy," said Sok An, adding that a 
ceasefire was a priority. "But first we have to stop the killing 
of the people." 
  But in a letter to Prince Ranariddh dated December 28, Khieu 
Samphan complained that the peace plan was being jeopardised by 
"a lot of political propaganda and military activities aimed at 
destroying Democratic Kampuchea (the Khmer Rouge)". 
  Another government minister admitted earlier a "political" 
dimension to the upsurge in fighting. "It's normal," he said. 
"When you start to negotiate, you have to put your weight in the 
military side also." 
  Thai military officials reported some 300 troops backed by 
two T-54 tanks attacked Khmer Rouge positions at Phum Kaedon, 
forcing about 1,000 people to flee towards nearby Thailand. The 
Thai army was on alert following the government's heavy mortar 
and artillery attacks on the Khmer Rouge on Saturday.

  [Text] Fighting between Cambodian Government forces and 
the Khmer Rouge [KR] was reported at 0300 yesterday, about five 
kilometers from the Thai border, south of Chong Chuk Khamao, 
Tambon Bak Dai in Kap Choeng District, Surin Province. The 
Khmer Rouge opened fire again at 0530 on Prince Sihanouk's 
government forces at Chong Thmodon-Chong Klang, about one 
kilometer from the Thai border. As a result, about 150 Cambodian 
civilians and soldiers crossed the border into Thailand. The 
Khmer Rouge have taken control of Chong Thmodon-Chong Klang, the 
site of Prince Norodom Sihanouk's former palace. 
  After the clashes, the Suranari Task Force ordered soldiers 
of Infantry Unit 23, Border Patrol Police Unit 21, and 
territorial defense forces of Kap Choeng District, Surin 
Province, to provide initial help for the Cambodians. 
Reinforcements have been sent to guard the border and prevent 
the fighting from spilling over into Thailand.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, Jan 3 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge guerrillas 
injured five civilians and burnt down about a hundred homes in 
an attack on a former stronghold of the royalist FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] Party in northwest Cambodia, 
government and military officials said Monday. An estimated 
300-strong group of guerrillas attacked Rumchang in the Ampil 
district bordering Thailand early New Year's day, military 
officials said. The Khmer Rouge withdrew after several hours, 
the officials said, adding the government had sent 
reinforcements to the area. 
  The attack took place as government troops were conducting 
an 
offensive on Khmer Rouge positions further west, near the border 
town of Poipet. 
  Fighting had died down in the Poipet area Monday, but the 
situation remained tense after three days of battles between the 
government and the guerrillas, Thai army officials said. 
  Prior to the May U.N.-organised elections which brought 
FUNCINPEC into a coalition government with their former Phnom 
Penh foe, the Cambodian People's Party, Rumchang served as a 
base for royalist troops and current co-premier Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh maintained a residence in the area. 
  The prince's former residence was not burnt in the attack, a 
government official said. 
  FUNCINPEC was in alliance with the Khmer Rouge throughout 
the 
13- year civil war which was brought to a formal end by the 
signing of the Paris peace agreement in October 1991.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "An Important Stance"] </F>
  [Text] Cambodia's concern about the attitude of the 
countries which still have contacts with the Khmer Rouge was an 
important topic during a recent summit meeting of top counselors 
from the Thai National Security Council and officials from the 
Thai Ministries of Foreign Affairs and National Defense. 
  The Thai officials attending the meeting concluded that 
Thailand should try its best to emphasize its attitude and 
intention [words indistinct] between the two countries. These 
Thai officials also called on the Thai Government to take 
(?steps) to assure Cambodia that the Thai Government fully 
supports the new Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] and that 
Thailand does not interfere in Cambodia's internal affairs. 
  This is another very important stance displayed by Thailand 
to contribute to the strengthening friendship and stability 
between the two countries, Cambodia and Thailand. They are 
moving forward in whichever direction toward national 
development. 
  During his recent visit to Cambodia, His Excellency [H.E.] 
Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri also emphasized this matter. 
  We believe that if Thailand adheres to the current stance 
that it recognizes only the RGC, Thai Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai's coming visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia will certainly 
achieve good results in strengthening the relations between the 
two countries [words indistinct]. Moreover, this will further 
weaken the Khmer Rouge rebels [words indistinct] who are 
attempting to renew the war.

  [Text] According to the Kompong Chhnang Province 
agricultural service, the province could experience a shortfall 
of 3,627 tonnes of food next year. Floods and a prolonged 
drought after the last rainy season have caused the shortage, 
damaging more than 4,300 hectares of rice out of 72,850 hectares. 
  Mr. Sau Saroeun, deputy governor of Kompong Chhnang 
Province, 
said that the total rice yield for this year's dry and rainy 
seasons is only 76,000 tonnes for its population 300,000. 
  In addition, Battambang Province, which is the Kingdom of 
Cambodia's rice bowl, has encountered many great difficulties 
due to natural calamities. Over 12,980 hectares of young rice 
plants were damaged in the recent rainy season. Moung Russei, 
Battambang, and Sangke were the districts that suffered the 
most. The provincial agricultural service says the damage to 
young rice coupled with [words indistinct] the repatriated 
people, Battambang Province probably need between 15,000 and 
20,000 tonnes of rice.

will be short of nearly 930 tonnes of rice in 1994 with the most 
needy localities being Prasat Sambo, Stoung, and Sandan 
Districts and the provincial township, says the local 
agriculture department. 
  The food shortage is caused by the unstable situation in the 
region, floods, a prolonged drought, and harmful insects. 
  The province's rice production, which is estimated to be 
about 125,000 tonnes, will be far less than what is needed.

  [Text] Thailand will continue implementing Asean's 
constructive engagement policy towards Burma, which has shown 
positive signs of returning to democracy, Foreign Minister 
Prasong Sunsiri said. 
  Rangoon had also expressed an interest in participating in 
Asean activities, including the Asean annual conference in July 
next year. 
  "Thailand's foreign policy for 1994 will continue give 
priority to neighbouring countries, particularly Burma, as the 
situation in the other countries such as Cambodia is improving 
to a satisfactory level," the minister said. 
  He repeated his earlier assertions that Laos, Vietnam, Burma 
and Cambodia should become more involved in the Asean forum. 
Laos and Vietnam have observer status; Cambodia was invited as 
"guest" to last year's Asean meeting in Singapore. 
  There was strong opposition within Asean until recently to 
Thai proposals to invite Rangoon to the annual meeting of the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Bangkok in July, due 
to its record of human rights violations and refusal to hand 
over administrative power to a government elected in the May 
1990 general polls. 
  According to Prasong, Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok 
Tong, during his recent visit to Bangkok, had shown a "positive 
response" to Bangkok's move to invite Rangoon to the July 
meeting. He did not elaborate. However government spokesman 
Aphisit Wetchachiwa told reporters during Goh's visit that 
Singapore preferred the issue be considered by the Asean senior 
officials meeting. 
  Prasong unofficially invited Burma to attend the annual 
Asean 
meeting as a "guest" during an official visit to Rangoon in 
September to co-chair the first Thai-Burma Joint Commission 
meeting. Burmese leaders said then they needed more time to 
consider the matter. 
  The minister, a former head of the National Security 
Council, 
reiterated his belief that a constructive engagement policy is 
more effective than trade sanctions as a means of encouraging 
Burma towards democracy. 
  The House Committee on human rights and justice recently 
sent 
a letter to members of Asean's Inter-Parliamentary Organization 
(IPO), asking them to push their governments to set conditions 
before accepting Burma into the six-nation regional grouping.

  [Excerpt] Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon yesterday in 
another surprise move gave the exporters the right to sell as 
much as half of their tapioca stocks to the high-priced market 
in the European Union (EU). The allocation covers a total of 
550,000 tonnes. THH Group is expected be the biggest 
beneficiary of the latest allocation. It will receive as a 
result an export quota of 155,179 tonnes for the EU market. 
  In the past, the ministry allowed exporters to sell about 20 
to 30 per cent of their stocks in the EU market because it 
wanted to exporters [as published] to share the EU export quota 
as much as possible. But because of the latest round of 
allocation, the EU export quota for 1994 at about 2 million 
tonnes of tapioca will, in the next four rounds of allocation, 
have to be divided into lots of 500,000 tonnes. 
  The ministry will allocate the quota according to the stock 
volume of each exporter, based on the volume derived from the 
first stock checking round. THH Group reported the largest 
stocks with a total of 337,322 tonnes of tapioca. 
  THH Group is also expected to receive almost Bt [baht] 60 
million from the commerce ministry through its subsidy 
programme, under which the ministry will pay Bt200 per every 
tonne that tapioca stocks increased between two inspections. 
  In 1994, the last year of the current four-year bilateral 
agreement between Thailand and the EU, the commerce ministry 
will allocate 60 per cent of the remaining quota of 4.3 million 
tonnes, or 2.6 million tonnes, according to the volume of stock 
held by exporters. The other 1.746 million tonnes will be 
distributed as bonus quotas for exporters who sell to 
lower-priced markets outside the EU. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [New Year message by Prime Minister Chuan Likphai; date and </F>
place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Dear fraternal Thai people, on the auspicious 
occasion of the approaching new year, 1994, on behalf of the 
government I wish to invite you to convey greetings to their 
majesties the king and queen and members of the royal family. 
May the power of the three gems and all sacred things in the 
universe protect them and provide them with prosperity, 
happiness, and long life so that they will remain figures 
beloved by the Thai people forever. 
  Fraternal Thai people, in 1993 the world situation has been 
improving steadily. This is because most countries have paid 
strong attention to the development of democracy and upholding 
human rights. At the same time, the arms race has been replaced 
by investment in economic benefits and improvement in the 
quality of life. This has resulted not only in happiness for 
the majority of the world's population, but has helped to 
steadily improve the international economy. Although the 
improvement of the international economy has not reached the 
level expected, it obviously exceeded that of the previous year. 
  Regarding our country, although there were two major 
tragedies in the middle of 1993 which resulted in many deaths, 
the compassion and cooperation of the Thai people enabled the 
tragedies to be less severe than they might have been. The 
tragedies serve as valuable lessons for those concerned that 
they must be aware of their responsibilities and duties. The 
lesson is that if a problem is created, its effects will 
eventually surface. 
  Fraternal Thai people, the general situation in 1993 was 
relatively peaceful and there was some progress. Data from the 
public and private sectors agree that the Thai economy was in a 
recovery stage. Economic growth increased in comparison with 
the previous year. This recovery demonstrates a degree of 
success of the government's efforts to tackle the continued 
recession, which resulted in reduced investment, as we all know. 
The government measures, however, particularly investment 
promotion measures and the development of Thailand into the 
regional financial center, as well as proper management of the 
capital market, have created confidence among local and foreign 
investors. This has resulted in private sector investment 
increasing 5.8 percent in 1993, compared with 0.9 percent in the 
previous year. 
  A welcome point in this investment is that part of it 
occurred in the regional areas, corresponding with the 
government's prosperity distribution policy which the government 
worked on earnestly throughout the year. The statistics show 
clearly that after the announcement of the prosperity 
distribution policy, about 1,200 investors applied for 
investment promotion privileges, a three-fold increase over the 
previous year. Total investment was about 300 billion baht and 
generated nearly 300,000 jobs. Of this investment, 60 percent 
was in Zone 3, which encompasses 60 regional provinces. 
  Another important measure in the prosperity distribution 
policy is the care for the farmers, who make up the poorest 
group of the population. Three examples of the government's 
concrete action in this regard are: 
  First, the government carried out land reform, issuing land 
use documents to farmers for 4.5 million rai of land. This is 
more than the total land reform achieved in the previous 18 
years. 
  Second, the government increased the budget allocation for 
construction of small water sources from 3.3 billion baht in 
1992 to 6.6 billion baht in 1993. This allocation will increase 
to 9 billion baht in 1994. 
  Third, the farmers' production costs have been lowered by 
cutting the loan interest rate to 5 percent on average for 
farmers who joined the production structure readjustment 
project. Low-priced fertilizer -- about 25 percent cheaper than 
the market price -- was also supplied to farmers. Some 300,000 
tons of this fertilizer were available in 1993, compared with 
80,000 tons in 1992. Some 500,000 tons will be available in 
1994. 
  Fraternal Thai people, many foreign and local institutions 
in 
the government and private sectors predict that Thai economic 
growth will go even higher in 1994. I wish to say to you that 
although such growth figures are a good sign, the government 
will not be complacent and will try to spread this growth among 
people in all sectors. It will adhere to the policy of 
distributing prosperity to the regional and rural areas, as 
mentioned in its policy statement to parliament. It will do its 
best to make this increase in national revenue go to the people 
in the regional and rural areas so that they will be able to 
eventually help themselves. 
  Therefore, the central task of rural and agricultural 
development in 1994 will be to adjust cultivation methods to 
meet market demands. This will raise the incomes of the farmers 
and reduce the risks associated with their occupation. The 
government has allocated 13.5 billion baht for this purpose in 
1994. Some 40 billion baht will be allocated through 1996 for 
continued efforts in this regard. Farmers have called loudly 
for implementation of this program. In addition, the government 
will act to stabilize prices for major crops. 
  Regarding social and environment development, the 
government will give assurances for the continued development of 
human resources and the quality of life. It has allocated 
nearly 100 billion baht for this purpose. Some 74 billion baht 
have been earmarked for health care. Some 23.5 billion baht 
will go for expansion of education opportunities. For 
environmental conservation, restoration, and development, some 
11 billion baht have been allocated. Violators of environmental 
law and those who intentionally destroy environmental and 
national resources will be prosecuted. I have emphasized often 
that industrial decentralization must not amount to spreading 
destruction among the people in the regional areas. 
  Regarding workers, the government established the Ministry 
of 
Labor and Social Welfare in late 1993 to oversee and protect the 
benefits of workers, promote their welfare, and develop their 
skills. In 1994 emphasis will be given to the protection of 
child labor, woman labor, and Thai workers abroad, as well as 
arranging an appropriate social security system, as evidenced by 
the government's submission of the social security bill, the 
compensation fund bill, and the job placement and workers 
protection bill for the consideration of parliament. 
  Fraternal Thai people, 1994 will be a year of hope for 
people 
around the world. In particular, the recent successful 
conclusion of the GATT negotiations can be regarded as a New 
Year gift for the whole world. This is because the GATT accord 
will enable trade to become more free, which will benefit every 
country in general. Thailand is expected to gain some benefits, 
but how much will depend on our ability to compete in the 
international arena. On the government's side, it will adjust 
the direction and mechanisms so that the country will be best 
able to compete. As for the private sector, whose adjustment is 
more rapid, I am confident that it has prepared to cope with the 
new international situation. 
  Regarding the drought and water shortage which is the 
concern 
of everyone, I wish to emphasize that the government has 
prepared many measures. These measures may not be effective 
without the cooperation of the people. Therefore, to enable all 
of us to overcome this crisis, I wish to appeal to you to pay 
attention and cooperate with the measures which the government 
will announce from time to time. 
  Regarding the drought, the government is grateful to the 
suggestions for long-term solutions to the water shortage which 
the king enunciated on his birthday anniversary, particularly 
the urgent projects to build dams on the Pa Sak, Nakhon Nayok, 
and Pak Phanang Rivers. I and the government will adopt these 
suggestions and pledge to the people that they will accelerate 
these projects. 
  Fraternal Thai people, on the anniversary of the 50th year 
of 
the king's enthronement in 1996, the government has planned 
major celebrations, which the king has given the name: 
Kanchanaphisek. The government has appointed a committee to plan 
these honorable and customary celebrations. It will invite the 
people to participate in the creation of a memorial or other 
objects as gifts for the king. The government will make 
announcements soon on this matter. 
  Fraternal Thai people, in 1993 the government spent 
considerable time explaining and solving various problems 
through the parliament and its mechanism. There were two 
ordinary sessions and two extraordinary sessions in the same 
year, which was unprecedented, considering that two annual 
budgets have to be deliberated in the same year. The government 
presented 48 bills for parliamentary consideration. Thanks to 
the cooperation of parliament, 29 bills were promulgated into 
law, which have contributed to the government's solution of the 
country's problems and to its national development efforts. 
  In any event, the solution of national problems in 
accordance 
with the parliamentary democracy system may feel to some people 
to be too time-consuming. I wish to explain that it is not 
right to solve problems in a superficial and biased manner. The 
ancillary issues within the entire system must be considered in 
the search for long-term effective solutions. It is undesirable 
to enact a short-term solution to a problem which will invite 
negative repercussions in the future. The principle of 
righteousness must be upheld, although to do so may run against 
the prevailing current of thought. I am confident that if we 
solve problems basing the solutions on rationality and technical 
knowledge, we will be successful and see good results for the 
country in the long term. 
  In any event, I agree that there are areas on which action 
has been taken that has not achieved the level of progress 
desired. This includes the solution of the traffic congestion in 
Bangkok. More than 400 additional cars enter the streets daily. 
For long-term results, there will have to be other solutions, 
not just limiting the city's growth. I pledge to march forward 
to effectively solve the outstanding problems and give the 
assurances that the government will administer the country 
honestly, keeping the interests and happiness of people in all 
sectors in mind. 
  On this New Year, the cabinet and I invoke the power of the 
three gems and sacred beings, as well as the might of their 
majesties the king and queen, to provide each of you happiness 
and prosperity in 1994 and forever after. 
  Goodbye.

<F P=106> [Report by Phiyanat Siwalo and Chatri Saengpeng on </F>
"end-of-year interview" with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai has vowed to maintain 
his low-key style of politics, despite the criticism it drew in 
1993, maintaining that what others see as an "aloofness" is 
actually respect for his allies' decisions and his belief that 
ministers should be allowed to settle their own problems. 
  Chuan said his hands-off politics is acceptable in a 
democratic system and he would prove it workable, even though 
the mass media often accused him of remaining aloof from the 
problems of the other coalition partners. 
  "I have always to keep in mind how a coalition government of 
five partners can stay together and work together," Chuan told 
THE NATION in an end-of-year interview. 
  "I have to respect every Cabinet member and entrust them all 
with power and responsibilities in their respective ministries. 
I don't have the time to do everything myself." 
  However, as premier, he would share the responsibility if 
any 
Cabinet members failed to perform to expectation. 
  Two incidents during the past year which led to criticism 
that Chuan was staying aloof from problems were the 
controversial removal of Pol Gen [Police General] Sawat 
Amonwiwat as police chief and the suspension of Permanent 
Secretary for Commerce Phatchara Itsrasena. 
  Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut catalyzed a series of 
controversies and protests from policemen when he initially 
seconded Sawat to an inactive post and eventually fired him. 
  After nearly a month of squabbling Chuan finally intervened, 
and Sawat was reinstated and immediately transferred to the post 
of inspector general at the Interior Ministry. 
  Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon suspended Phatchara 
from 
duty pending the outcome of a lawsuit filed against him by an 
oil importing company. 
  Chuan said he could not step in immediately whenever 
problems 
occurred because he had to allow the respective ministers to try 
to solve the matters first. 
  "It's rather had to work as a coalition government. We have 
to respect our working partners and when problems happen we have 
to share responsibility," Chuan said. 
  "In fact, I've helped settle problems in other agencies 
several times. But I've had to keep a low profile and not seek 
publicity. 
  "If I had solved other people's problems and then announced 
that those particular ministries had problems which I had 
cleared up, the respective ministers would lose face. I won't 
do that." 
  He said sometimes the partners' platforms might contradict 
each other, but a compromise could be reached if all parties 
adhered to the government's announced policies. But Chuan said 
he did wish he had known in advance of Uthai's decision to 
suspend Phatchara, as he would have objected. 
  "The only issue that I have not known of in advance is the 
suspension of Phatchara on grounds that a lawsuit had been filed 
against him. Had I known, I would not have allowed it." 
  The prime minister said he has faith in democracy, and 
believes it will always provide the means to solve the country's 
problems. 
  "As long as we don't create the conditions, like corruption, 
history will not repeat itself. Now, people well understand the 
democratic system and everybody feels involved in it. The 
people feel much closer to an elected government." 
  Chuan said the past year had proved that rumours about a 
House dissolution remained only "rumours". 
  "I've always told the public not to believe rumours. Only I 
can seek a Royal command to dissolve the House and it's never 
occurred to me to do it," Chuan said. 
  "Rumours about a House dissolution spread several times in 
the past year and only proved that rumours are rumours." 
  The prime minister blamed speculators for spreading the 
rumours in a bid to force share prices down so they could buy 
cheap stocks. 
  On the economics front, the prime minister said the 
government had been successful in running the country during the 
past year, shoring up the business sector's confidence. 
  This confidence and the healthy economic situation in the 
world market had contributed to the country's growth. 
  This year, he said, the government will work to maintain and 
increase that growth.

<F P=106> [New Year Message by King Phumiphon Adunyadet -- recorded] </F>
  [Text] Thai people, the New Year is an occasion when we 
should be thinking of each other and wishing each other 
happiness and the fulfilment of his aspirations. I convey my 
good wishes to everyone and thank you very much for your good 
cooperation and support in all my endeavors. 
  In the past year several abnormal events occurred, including 
the simultaneous events of drought and flooding. Some of these 
abnormal events caused anxiety and concern, while some greatly 
affected the livelihood, occupation, and economy of individuals 
and the country. However, because most of us have good sense, 
perseverance, strong mind, and compassion, we were able to 
cooperate to alleviate the severity of these events. 
  These abnormal events should make you realize that in a 
person's life he is going to face danger, obstacles, good as 
well as bad luck. No one will be able to live happily forever. 
Everyone must prepare his mind and body to be ready to cope 
with and recover from abnormalities and problems, using 
rationality, sound knowledge, righteousness, thoroughness, and 
the power of unity. 
  I strongly wish that everyone is aware of and truly 
understands the country's situation. That is, our country now 
needs efficient and urgent development so that it will fully 
benefit from its resources and from every Thai person's labor 
and intelligence. There can be no delay for any reason, because 
whatever benefits that could be gained will be wasted. In this 
era, such a waste is a loss. 
  We can all help by being determined to uphold national 
interests as the goal. Selfish interests and disputes over 
nonsensical matters must be minimized. One must quickly perform 
and complete his duties to the best of his ideas, knowledge, 
ability and to do so with sincerity, kindness, a sense of unity, 
and good intention toward others. In this way, the achievements 
of everyone will consolidate into happiness, security, and 
prosperity of the country, which is our ultimate goal. 
  May the power of the three gems and all sacred beings in the 
universe protect you from all danger and evil and endow you with 
good and strong health, mind, and wisdom to successfully carry 
out all your activities that benefit yourself, the country, as 
well as its independence, freedom, and happiness forever. May 
everyone of you enjoy happiness and prosperity and the 
fulfillment of your wishes.

  [Text] After working for 21 days, the Fourth Session of the 
Ninth National Assembly held its closing session today. 
  In the morning, after continuing debate on the bill on 
business bankruptcy, the National Assembly voted to pass the 
resolution on redrawing the administrative boundaries of the Deo 
Ca Pass-Vung Ro Lagoon Area between Phu Yen and Khanh Hoa 
Provinces, the resolution approving the final balance of the 
1992 state budget, and the resolution on legislative work for 
1994. 
  In the afternoon, the National Assembly voted to pass the 
resolution on the 1994 state budget estimates and the resolution 
on the movement for thrift and against waste, corruption, and 
smuggling. The National Assembly also voted to pass the Law on 
Business Bankruptcy and the resolution on tasks for 1994. 
  Finally, National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh delivered 
a 
speech concluding the Fourth Session of the Ninth National 
Assembly. He evaluated the results of the session and pointed 
out the achievements made by our party, people, and soldiers in 
the socioeconomic field this year. At the same time, he also 
pointed out limitations, shortcomings, and difficulties that the 
entire country must strive to overcome in the coming period. 
  National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh said: 
  [Begin recording] Stemming from the aforementioned 
situation, 
and in view of the new situation, the National Assembly 
discussed and passed the resolution on tasks for 1994, the 
resolution on the 1994 state budget estimates, the resolution 
approving the final balance of the 1992 state budget, and the 
resolution on the movement for thrift and against waste, 
corruption, and smuggling. These are important documents. The 
National Assembly outlined major and practical measures to 
mobilize forces and concentrate the energy and resources of the 
entire country on socioeconomic construction and development and 
on restoring national order and discipline. It also clarified 
the responsibility of the National Assembly Standing Committee, 
government, departments, echelons, National Assembly deputies, 
and citizens with regard to implementing these resolutions. 
  We have to affirm that the fight against corruption and 
smuggling is a continuous fight for all of society. We must be 
resolute in obliterating this harmful practice gradually, thus 
creating a healthy environment for socioeconomic development and 
for the construction of a law-abiding Vietnamese Government of 
the people, by the people, and for the people. The first task 
is gradually to build and perfect a uniform legal system that 
will concretize the party's renovation line in all fields of 
social life. 
  During this session, the National Assembly passed the Law on 
Environmental Protection, a law amending and supplementing some 
articles of the Law on Organization of People's Courts, and the 
Law on Business Bankruptcy. These are important and necessary 
laws to create a legal foundation for socioeconomic development 
and provide a guarantee for business activities, accelerate 
national renovation, and protect our living environment. 
  The National Assembly also evaluated the past legislative 
situation and the resolution on legislative work for 1994. It 
offered opinions and directions for the legislative program 
spanning from 1995 until the end of the official term of the 
Ninth National Assembly. It also outlined the draft labor code 
and the draft law on the state budget. The National Assembly 
tasked responsible organs with conducting further studies before 
presenting these bills at the next session. 
  The National Assembly highly evaluated our government's 1993 
foreign affairs activities, which actively contributed to the 
common struggle of people around the world for peace, national 
independence, democracy, and social progress. This was done in 
the spirit of Vietnam seeking friendship with all nations in the 
world community that are striving for peace, independence, and 
development. In order to develop these achievements in the 
future, we will accelerate the implementation of our foreign 
policy, which stresses independence, sovereignty, 
diversification of multilateral relations, and consolidation of 
the friendship and multi-faceted relations will all nations -- 
especially our neighbors, countries in Southeast Asia and the 
Asia-Pacific region, and international organizations. This will 
create more favorable conditions for our national construction 
and protection. 
  Having been a victim for centuries of human rights 
violations 
committed by invading forces, our government and people are very 
earnest about independence and freedom. We are resolute in 
fully observing the fundamental rights of human beings, which 
are regulated by the 1992 Constitution. 
  Dear National Assembly deputies, with a sense of national 
pride and in order to develop our tradition of diligence and 
creativeness, our entire Army and people are determined to 
overcome all difficulties and challenges and carry out the 
directions and tasks for 1994 as outlined in the National 
Assembly resolutions. These are: To solidify achievements made 
in our renovation; move ahead with industrialization and 
modernization; grasp opportunities for rapid acceleration of the 
economic development rate, so as to bring our country into a new 
period of development; create an important change in the fields 
of culture and society; maintain political stability; broaden 
our foreign relations; and protect our national independence, 
sovereignty, and integrity. 
  In that spirit, the National Assembly calls on people and 
soldiers across the country as well as our overseas compatriots 
to unite in heart and in strength, quickly grasp opportunities, 
eliminate all dangers, practice thrift in production and 
consumption, increase development investment for material 
production, and mobilize their resources and abilities to make 
our country even more beautiful than our beloved President Ho 
Chi Minh hoped. 
  Dear National Assembly deputies, the success of the Ninth 
National Assembly's Fourth Session is the result of the active 
contributions of the government, National Assembly deputies, 
National Assembly organs, related government organs, and voters 
in the country. The National Assembly sincerely thanks 
high-level leading comrades, revolutionary senior citizens, and 
former National Assembly deputies for their keen interest and 
their opinion during this session. It welcomes the efforts 
exerted by mass media agencies in their timely reflection of the 
National Assembly's vivid activities, which met the interests of 
people inside and outside the country. It thanks the 
wholehearted and enthusiastic contributions of all organs that 
provided services during this session. 
  As we enter 1994, I warmly wish the National Assembly 
deputies, distinguished guests, people, and soldiers across the 
country -- as well as our overseas compatriots -- a new year of 
good health and happiness so as to record more achievements. I 
declare the Fourth Session of the Ninth National Assembly 
closed. Thank you. [end recording] 
  The Army band then played the national anthem, ending the 
Fourth Session of the Ninth National Assembly.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Ninth National Assembly's Fourth </F>
Session in Hanoi on 30 December] 
  [Text] The National Assembly held a plenary session in the 
Ba Dinh Conference Hall on 30 December 1993. National Assembly 
Vice Chairman Phung Van Tuu directed the morning sitting, while 
National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh directed the afternoon 
sitting. 
  The deputies continued to debate the Law on Business 
Bankruptcy. Mai Thuc Lan, director of the National Assembly 
Economy and Budget Committee, delivered a report on behalf of 
the National Assembly Secretariat, the Law Review Committee, and 
the Law Compiling Committee summarizing the views expressed by 
deputies during the 29 December session and the planned 
amendments to the draft Law on Business Bankruptcy. A total of 
11 deputies expressed different views on the draft document, 
including: Pham Phu from Ho Chi Minh City, Nguyen Duc Hoan from 
Quang Tri, Tang Van Nghi and Nguyen Viet Dung from Ha Bac, Phung 
Van Toan and Le Dinh Thanh from Vinh Phu, Pham Hung from Hai 
Hung, Nguyen Duy Oanh from Lam Dong, Tran Quang Ngoc from Nam 
Ha, Nguyen Van Tu from Dong Nai, and Ton That Bach from Hanoi. 
  The National Assembly Secretariat, the Law Review Committee, 
and the Law Compiling Committee reviewed the draft Law on 
Business Bankruptcy once more based on the deputies' views. Ly 
Tai Luan, vice chairman of the National Assembly Economy and 
Budget Committee and member of the National Assembly 
Secretariat, read the text of this draft document. The deputies 
adopted the Law on Business Bankruptcy by a vast majority of 
votes. The promulgation of this law is of great importance and 
significance because it protects the legitimate rights and 
interests of creditors, debtors, and all parties concerned and 
defines the responsibilities of debtors with regard to business 
bankruptcies. This will contribute to guaranteeing effective 
business operations and securing social order. 
  Afterward, the National Assembly heard the following: 
  -- National Assembly Secretariat head Vu Mao read the text 
of 
the draft resolutions on tasks for 1994; the movement for thrift 
and against waste, corruption, and smuggling; and the 1994 
legislative work program. 
  -- National Assembly Secretariat member Ly Tai Luan read the 
text of the draft resolutions on the 1994 state budget estimates 
and approving the final balance of the 1994 [as heard] state 
budget. 
  -- National Assembly Secretariat member Nguyen Van Yeu read 
the text of the draft resolution on redrawing the administrative 
boundaries of the Deo Ca Pass-Vung Ro Lagoon area between Phu 
Yen and Khanh Hoa Provinces. 
  After a number of deputies expressed their views, the 
National Assembly adopted the aforementioned draft resolutions 
by a vast majority of votes. 
  After a closing speech by National Assembly Chairman Nong 
Duc 
Manh, the Fourth Session of the Ninth National Assembly of the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam concluded at 1730 on 30 December 
1993 as the music of the national anthem was played by a 
military band.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA 29 -- Vietnam saw development in 
import-export activities for 1993. The export value is 
estimated at USD [U.S. dollars] 3 billion, an increase of 20 per 
cent over last year. 
  One of remarkably increased exports is aquatic products. In 
1993, total output of aquatic products is estimated at about 1.4 
million tonnes, including two-thirds of products for export 
worth USD 350 million. The export value increases 22 percent 
compared with that of last year. Many frozen aquatic products 
and specialities such as cuttlefish, shrimps and crabs are sold 
well in foreign markets. 
  Also in 1993 Vietnam exported 1.8 million tonnes of rice. 
From a country which was always suffered from shortage of food, 
Vietnam now ranks third among rice export country in the world. 
Notably, the amount of high quality rice has increased year 
after year. 
  Besides the export of rice and aquatic products, Vietnam's 
exports of textile and garment products to EC market presented a 
great part among goods exported to EC. According to the trade 
agreement with the EC in 1993 Vietnam is due to export to the EC 
151 categories so far, 93 businesses are engaged into production 
of 53 categories, mostly jackets and shirts. 
  By early December 1993, the Vietnam National Oil Equipment 
and Technology Import Corporation (Petechim) has pumped the 
twenty millionth tonne of crude oil. Since 1987 Petechim has 
exported 18 million tonnes of crude oil. Besides, Vietnam has 
also exported agricultural products, foodstuff, consumer goods 
such as tea, coffee, fresh fruits, leathershoes... This year, 
Vietnam obtained 130,000 tonnes of coffee an increase of 25 
percent compared with last year's figure and exported 128,000 
tonnes earning more than USD 104 million. In Asia the Pacific, 
Vietnam becomes one of major coffee producers after Indonesia 
and India. It is expected to obtain 10,000 tonnes more in the 
year to come. So far this year Vietnam has exported 20,000 
tonnes of tea, up by 30 percent compared with last year's figure 
and exported 50,000 tonnes of rubber, etc.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 1 -- The Vietnam Chamber of Commerce 
and Industry (VCCI) has this year diversified its activities to 
promote trade and foreign investment, and to support businesses 
in their profit-making activities in the country, said VCCI 
President Doan Duy Thanh in an interview with the national daily 
NHAN DAN recently. The vcci president said in 1993 the VCCI 
admitted 262 more members, including 56 associated ones who are 
foreign businesses having opened branches or representative 
offices in Vietnam, and joint ventures between Vietnam and 
foreign countries. It was the first time VCCI welcomed foreign 
businesses to join VCCI. 
  VCCI established relationships and signed cooperation 
agreements with commerce chambers and trade promotion 
organizations in 11 countries. It also set up seven commissions 
or councils specializing in bilateral cooperations with foreign 
countries, and promoted existing ties with some international 
and non-governmental organizations. Moreover, Doan Duy Thanh 
added, the VCCI arranged, the visits of nearly 10,000 business 
delegations from 52 countries to Vietnam and those of 20 
delegations consisting of about 1,000 Vietnamese businessmen 
abroad to study foreign outlets and inquire into the 
possibilities for trade and investment. Six major exhibition 
fairs were held within the country in addition to two others 
abroad under the auspices of the VCCI. VCCI has provided legal 
and bussiness consultancy for businessmen to help them work out 
business deals and investment projects as well as settle 
disputes in external and internal relations. Sixteen 
professional-training courses were opened for more than 1,200 
businessmen from various VCCI members. More than 40,000 sets of 
certificates on origin of export commodities were granted to 
Vietnam's businesses, helped 1,600 labels to be registered, 
provided industrial protection to 27 industrial designs and 57 
inventions. On VCCI's plans for 1994, Mr. Thanh said the 
chamber should pay more attention to membership expansion, 
especially to the small and medium-sized busimessmen in all 
ecomomic sectors. A centre would be set up by VCCI to assist 
small and medium-sized businesses in finance, management and 
marketting. Eight international exhibition fairs are expected 
to be held in Vietnam next year complete with four or five 
others in Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea, to introduce 
Vietnam's export goods and foreign investment-calling projects.

  [Text] The national renovation process in Vietnam has made 
big progress in 1993. Many changes for the better have taken 
place in socio-cultural fields and the state has given priority 
concern to human resources. Positive developments have been 
seen in the field of education and training in the 1992-93 
school year. In 1993, the state earmarked an appropriate budget 
to invest in the development of all educational branches from 
creches and preschool classes to general education and higher 
education. In addition to public schools, many private, 
semi-public, and people-founded schools have been set up. 
Besides, there are schools for handicapped children, charity 
classes, or family classes. In addition to existing 
universities, Vietnam has established open universities in Hanoi 
and Ho Chi Minh City to meet the people's learning needs. 
  Short-term job training courses have also developed in big 
cities. While primary education has been universalized, proper 
attention has been paid to eradicating illiteracy. This is a 
central task to improve the people's knowledge in the open-door 
economy. Attention has also been paid to the training of young 
talents. This year, two Vietnamese teams attended international 
olympiad on mathematics and physics and won glorious results. 
  Noteworthy in 1993 cultural activities was the 10th Film 
Festival. This event once again affirmed the position of 
Vietnamese cinematography in people's lives. It is followed by 
the Autumn Music Festival. Traditional art also obtained good 
results in 1993. Vietnamese traditional art troupes and foreign 
art troupes have exchanged many visits this year. 
  1993 also saw positive changes in the health service. 
National health programs have been effectively deployed, 
including the anti-malaria program, the expanded program on 
immunization, the anti-epidemics program, goiter and AIDS 
prevention programs. Grass-roots medical networks have been 
improved and upgraded. Efforts are being made to provide 
medical service to all communes in the coming years. Health 
insurance has over the last (?five) years been provided to the 
Vietnamese people to improve the quality of medical examinations 
and treatment. 
  The Seventh Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam [CPV] 
formulated the strategy for socioeconomic stabilization and 
development till the year 2000, focusing on job creation and 
maximum utilization of labor force. In 1993, for the first 
time, the National Assembly adopted a state budget of 820 
billion dong to generate and rearrange jobs. In three years 
from 1991-93, 2.3 million people were provided with jobs. In 
1993, the National Fund for Employment granted nearly 200 
billion dong to 5,000 assorted projects throughout the country, 
invested 50 billion dong to build and equip occupational 
training centers and employment bureaus. The movement for 
eradication of hunger and alleviation of poverty and mutual help 
in household economy has helped to stabilize the lives of 
thousands of families in difficult situations. 
  Action has been taken to fight against prostitution, drug 
addiction, and other social evils. 1993 saw growth of Vietnam 
in the field of exports, both in quality and quantity. At the 
17th SEA [Southeast Asia] Games, Vietnam bagged 34 medals of 
which nine were gold medals, ranking sixth in Southeast Asia. 
It was also a successful year for Vietnamese chess players. 
Dao Thien Hai won the world chess champion for the 16-age group 
and Nguyen Anh Dung won the world chess champion for the 20-age 
group. At the second international Wushu competition, Nguyen 
Thuy Hien, badge 14, won two medals, one gold and one silver, 
becoming the first Vietnamese winner in this event. 
  1993 closed to many successes in sociocultural fields, 
creating impetus for promising achievements in 1994.

  [Text] Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka has made an 
appeal for national unity following the burial of President Ratu 
Sir Penaina Ganilau. In a new year message, Mr. Rabuka said 
Ratu Sir Penaina had always emphasized that Fiji's multiracial 
population needed to live in peace and harmony. The body of 
Ratu Sir Penaina, who died of cancer in the United Sates 
hospital on 16 December, was taken back for burial to his home 
island of Taveuni yesterday after lying in state at government

  [Text] The Papua New Guinea [PNG] government says it has 
nothing to hide in an effort to solve the Bougainville crisis. 
State Minister for Bougainville Michael Ogio says he denies 
suggestions by supporters in Sydney of Bougainville 
secessionists that security forces were undertaking a major 
military buildup in preparation to retake the Panguna copper 
mine. Mr. Ogio has described the claim as irrelevant, 
misleading, and totally out of context. He said he also denied 
claims by the Bougainville Freedom Movement that 
Australia-supplied Iroquois helicopters were being used as 
gunships. Mr. Ogio says the helicopters on Bougainville are 
being used for humanitarian purposes and the transportation of 
ground staff to inaccessible areas.

  [Text] An Australian-based spokesman for rebels on the 
Papua New Guinea [PNG] island of Bougainville says government 
forces are maintaining their positions after an earlier advance 
towards the copper mine at Panguna. But, the spokesman, (Moses 
Havini), says Bougainville Revolutionary Army [BRA] forces are 
monitoring the situation closely and remain on a (?first) state 
of alert. The PNG government says its troops are now about five 
kilometers to the southwest of the mine and will assess the 
situation before moving into the mining area itself. Reports 
that hundreds of civilians from the Panguna area are moving into 
government care centers are said to have been denied by the 
rebels. The government said it wants to regain control of the 
Australian-owned mine by the end of the year.

  [Text] Jeffrey Garten, U.S. under secretary for 
international trade, who has been here since 20 December to 
attend meetings on automobiles and auto parts in the Japan-U.S. 
comprehensive economic talks, and Sozaburo Okamatsu, deputy 
vice-minister for international trade and industry, gave news 
conferences separately to explain the progress of negotiations 
on 22 December. 
  Both of them reaffirmed the position of wanting to conclude 
the negotiations in the auto sector by the time of the 
Japan-U.S. summit in February. But debate on setting numerical 
targets is still ongoing with no differences in views being 
narrowed. 
  Under Secretary Garten said: "We are not seeking managed 
trade. Nor are we seeking to set the numberical targets as 
objective criteria." But he added, "We need criteria to measure 
the degree of progress made" if trade balance in the auto 
sector, which remains a large factor in Japan's huge trade 
surplus, is to be improved. 
  On the other hand, Okamatsu emphasized once again that Japan 
would continue to reject the setting of numerical targets as a 
way of measuring the degree of foreign products' entry into the 
Japanese market. 
  Regarding the fact that the United States is pressing Japan 
to open its market, citing higher shares which foreign products 
hold in other major nations, Okamatsu insisted that "foreign 
products' share in the United States is not much different from 
their share in Japan" if the products from NAFTA member nations 
are excluded. He thus called on the United States to rethink 
its idea on criteria.

  [Text] The Fair Trade Commission [FTC] on 22 December 
compiled the results of its survey on business practices by the 
plate glass, auto, auto parts, and paper industries. The United 
States is claiming that these four Japanese industries are 
closed to foreign competition. The survey showed that "they 
have been improving their business practices as can be seen in 
one case in which a company has stopped giving rebates to its 
agent, a practice which can prevent other companies from 
entering the market." 
  The FTC had earlier conducted a similar survey based on an 
agreement reached between Japan and the United States at a 
follow-up meeting held in July, 1992 for the Japanese-U.S. 
Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) talks. The results 
showed that special agents dealt only with commodities from 
certain makers and they were receiving progressive rebates from 
the makers in return for their agreement to set targets for 
business transactions between them. 
  In June 1993, the FTC notified the four previously-mentioned 
industries of problems in their business practices. The recent 
survey was conducted in November and December to see how the 
industries had improved business practices following the warning. 
  The results of the survey apparently show that "each 
industry 
is making sincere efforts to improve its business practices." 
  According to the survey, companies in these four industries

  The FTC plans to "keep watching to see if the industries

  [Text] On 24 December, a senior Foreign Ministry official 
pointed out that "fundamentally, the United States will be 
making demands on Japan at the Japanese-U.S. framework talks 
because Japan has a huge trade surplus with the United States." 
At the same time, he hinted at the possibility that Japan may 
make more compromises than the United States, saying, "It is 
necessary for Japan to make further compromises (to reach 
agreement at the framework talks)."

  [Text] The United States' Cray Research Company, the 
world's largest supercomputer company, plans to call on the 
Japanese Government to revise its procurement procedures 
involving supercomputers. The company will recommend that the 
governments of both Japan and the U.S. tighten their methods of 
technical review and set minimum acceptable price ceilings for 
procured items. So far, Cray has bid successfully on only one 
of eight contracts that the Japanese Government has awarded 
under the first supplementary budget of 1993, and is unhappy 
about this situation. Meanwhile, the Japanese Government and 
manufacturers are unhappy about the way the U.S. Government 
conducts its procurement. As such, it is likely that there will 
be a reaction to Cray's position. 
  Before biddings on a total of 11 computers to be procured 
under the supplementary budget began, John Carlson, Cray's 
chairman, had said that his "goal is to land contracts on four 
or five of them." So far, it has procured a contract on only one 
computer. While there are three more contracts for which to 
bid, it is likely that the company will win only one of them. 
Cray believes that its poor performance is due to the method of 
technical review, which prevents its products' technical 
advantages to stand out in view of the low- price bids of 
Japanese manufacturers. 
  The company's officer concerned said his company "will not 
file a complaint on the biddings this time," but the company 
plans to request that in biddings henceforth, evaluations of 
product performance be conducted by a third party, and that 
lower-limit price ceilings be instituted in addition to the 
upper-limit ceilings currently required. 
  But among Japanese manufacturers there are voices saying: 
"It 
is absurd to set lower-limit ceilings on bid prices. Price 
competition contributes to lowering government expenditures." 
Some also note that in the biddings made under the 
supplementary budget, three out of eight successful bidders are 
to provide U.S.-made products, which, they say, means that 
progress is being made in market liberalization.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] will review a plan, which Boeing Corporation of the 
United States and Japanese aircraft manufacturers jointly have 
been promoting, for the development of the next-generation 
medium-sized passenger airplane (YXX). It will do so because 
the YXX development plan became virtually dead in the wake of 
Boeing Corporation's decision to give priority to the 
development of new passenger airplane (737X), which will carry 
almost the same number of passengers as the YXX. Starting in 
fiscal 1994, the ministry wants to suspend the development plan 
for the time being and ultimately start it afresh. The YXX 
development plan is the first joint project, which Japan and the 
Untied States started on equal terms. Together with a plan to 
develop short-range medium-sized passenger airplane (YSX), it 
has been considered as a pillar of Japan's aircraft development. 
  The YXX is a medium-sized passenger airplane, which can 
carry 
about 150 passengers. Japanese manufacturers, including 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries, and 
Boeing Corporation started the joint development in 1981. The 
Japanese Government and industries joined the project to take 
over 25 percent of the share in the development project. So 
far, they have conducted research to improve energy efficiency 
of the aircraft and studied the trend of market demand for the 
aircraft. MITI earmarked 613 million yen for the project in its 
fiscal 1994 budget request. 
  MITI wants to start the YXX plan afresh because Boeing 
Corporation officially decided recently to develop medium-sized 
passenger airplane called 737X, which can carry from 100 to 160 
passengers. It is an aircraft that will succeed the Boeing 737 
series. More than 3,000 Boeing 737's have been sold so far. 
Since it is not a completely new development project, 
development costs of the 737X will be kept low. Also, it is 
expected that the aircraft will be in great demand. 
  Because of this, MITI concluded that they cannot expect a 
big 
demand for the YXX and that the development of the YXX, which 
will compete with the 737X, is not commercially feasible. MITI 
plans to suspend the development starting in fiscal 1994 after 
consulting with aircraft manufacturers and Japan Aircraft 
Development Association, which acts as a contact point for the 
YXX plan. MITI, which wants to start the project afresh 
ultimately, plans to inform the Boeing Corporation of its 
intention in the near future and call for its understanding. 
  Regarding the budget request, MITI will ask the Finance 
Ministry for 500 million yen, which will be used to pay for the 
interest of development expenses spent so far.

  [Excerpts] Both the Japanese and American people evaluate 
current Japan-U.S. relations more favorably than a year ago and 
see brighter prospects for future bilateral ties, a joint poll 
conducted in Japan and the United States this month by ASAHI 
SHIMBUN and Harris polls has revealed. [passage omitted] 
  Asked about current Japan-U.S. relations, 37 percent of the 
Japanese pollees said they think current bilateral relations are 
"going well" followed by 42 percent saying they "do not think 
so." Among the American pollees, 49 percent said they think 
Japan-U.S. relations are "going very well," or "going well to a 
certain degree" followed by 49 percent who regarded them as "not 
going well" or "bad." [passage omitted] 
  On the question of future Japan-U.S. relations, the 
percentage of those who answered Japan-U.S. relations "will move 
toward a favorable direction" jumped from the previous 10 
percent to 26 percent. The percentage of those who think they 
will move toward a "bad direction" decreased from the previous 
24 percent to 15 percent. Meanwhile, in the United States, 
those who believe they will go toward a "good direction" rapidly 
increased from 33 percent to 51 percent. [passage omitted] 
  Asked about relations between the leaders of the two 
countries, the percentage of those who answered that they think 
relations between them have become "better" reached 20 percent 
both in Japan and the United States. However, on trade 
relations, the percentage of Japanese pollees who said they 
think they have become "better" reached 10 percent followed by 
28 percent who regarded them as "worse." In the United States, 
the figures were 28 percent and 11 percent respectively.

  [Text] Concerning the recent accident involving aircraft 
belonging to the U.S. Marine Corps, the prefectural government 
asked an office of the four military branches coordinator of the 
U.S. Forces on Okinawa on 22 December to investigate the cause 
of the accident and to prevent similar accidents from recurring. 
The prefectural government pointed out that although the 
accident occurred in training airspace, concerns of local 
residents who live near Kadena Air Base [KAB] are growing 
because the aircraft took off from KAB. Accordingly, the office 
was asked to conduct a through safety review.

  [Text] Kadena -- The Okinawa Peace Center and the Labor 
Union of Central Region held a "rally to protest against an 
accident involving FA-18 fighter aircraft" in the morning of 22 
December at a place commonly called "hill overlooking the 
Japan-U.S. Security Treaty" in Kadena-cho. They protested 
against the accident involving U.S. military aircraft and called 
for suspension of flights over residential areas. 
  It was an emergency rally designed to protest against an 
accident involving two FA-18 Hornets from Kadena Air Base [KAB] 
which flew into each other in a training area over the Pacific 
southeast of Okinawa on 17 December. About 60 people, including 
members of the labor union, attended the rally. They expressed 
their feelings by raising their fists at the KAB. 
  At the rally, Yoshimasa Karimata, vice chairman of the Peace 
Center; Kazuo Senaga, vice chairman of the Central Region Labor 
Union; and Seiyu Nakamura, representative of the Joint Struggle 
Council Against Noise, made speeches at the rally. They 
stressed the need to promote daily struggle [nichijoteki na 
tatakai], saying: "We cannot sleep at night because a similar 
accident could happen over land. Danger is always involved in 
the military trainings." 
  Moreover, after Akira Nakane, member of the prefectural 
assembly, and other representatives expressed their resolve, the 
rally adopted a "protest resolution to denounce the FA-18 
aircraft accident and to call for immediate suspension of 
flights by U.S. military aircraft over residential areas." 
Copies of the resolution will be forwarded to the director of 
the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, the U.S. 
ambassador to Japan, and other officials.

  [Text] Tokyo -- In protest against a recent incident in 
which a rescue gear was dropped from a U.S. Military helicopter, 
the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly delegation (composed of five 
assembly members led by Tadamori Kikuyama) visited the 
headquarters of the U.S. Forces Japan [USFJ], and other organs 
including the American Embassy, the Foreign Ministry, the Naha 
Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA], and the Okinawa 
Development Agency on 21 and 22 December. In meeting with 
representatives of those organizations, the delegation called on 
them to "prevent the recurrence of the accident" and "change a 
flying course to prevent U.S. military helicopters from flying 
over residential areas." 
  In response, each representative said: "We will make all-out 
efforts to prevent the recurrence of the accident." However, in 
reply to the delegation's call for a change of the flying 
course, Lieutenant Colonel Charles R. Steed [as published], who 
is chief of the government-related affairs section of the USFJ 
Headquarters, said "Okinawa is so small that it is impossible to 
avoid flying over the residential area," thus indicating change 
of the flying route is impossible. He said the cause of the 
accident is "under investigation," stressing "we will do our 
utmost to prevent the recurrence of accidents from now on." 
  Nobukatsu Kanehara, principal deputy director of the 
National 
Security Affairs Division under the North American Affairs 
Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, said: "We have called on the 
U.S. military to prevent the recurrence of the accident and take 
safety measures." Tadayuki Nakada, director of Compensation and 
Operation Division of the General Affairs Department under the 
DFAA, said: "The DFAA cannot make any direct petitions to the 
U.S. forces."

  [Text] Chatan-cho -- Chatan-cho Township Assembly (chaired 
by Seiei Sakihama) on 24 December, the last day of its December 
regular session, unanimously passed a resolution protesting the 
7 December incident in Kitanakagusuku-son, in which rescue gears 
were dropped from a U.S. military helicopter, and the aircraft 
crash accident on 17 December involving FA-18 Hornet fighters. 
Copies of the resolution will be mailed to six offices 
concerned, including the U.S. ambassador to Japan, the 
commander-in-chief of the U.S. Armed Forces in Japan, and the 
coordinator of four branches of services of the U.S. Armed 
Forces on Okinawa. 
  In the resolution, the town assembly protested the 
accidental 
dropping of rescue gears from a U.S. military helicopter, 
declaring: "Accidents of dropping things by U.S. military 
aircraft and helicopters are too many to count. Everytime such 
accidents occurred, we strongly requested relevant organizations 
of the U.S. Forces to do their utmost to prevent recurrence of 
such accidents. From this incident ignoring residents' safety, 
we have no choice but to conclude that the U.S. Forces are still 
entertaining the occupation troop mentality, and are not serious 
about enforcing strict discipline." 
  Concerning the crash accident involving FA-18 Hornet 
fighters, the Chatan Assembly denounced the U.S. Forces, 
stating: "Each time an incident or accident involving U.S. 
military bases occurred, the town assembly filed complaints, 
strongly calling for the U.S. Forces' efforts to prevent such 
incidents or accidents from recurring. We regret that another 
accident occurred in spite of this. We cannot accept any more 
sacrifices and discriminations."

  [Text] It has become clear that the Nodong-I ballistic 
missiles being produced by the DPRK (North Korea) are mobile. 
This was revealed by an international military source on 23 
December. If these missiles are operationally deployed in the 
conditon of being able to be moved around, most likely it will 
become difficult for Japan to intercept them when they are fired 
at this country or for the U.S. armed forces to attack the 
missiles in case of contigencies. The source predicted that the 
Nodong-I missiles will be operationally deployed next year. 
  According to the Defense Agency, North Korea succeeded in 
test-firing a Nodong-I missile into the Sea of Japan in late 
May. At that time, missiles were launched from a fixed 
launching pad on the coast facing the Sea of Japan. As such, it 
was thought that changing missile launching positions would be 
difficult. But the analysis of information carried out by Japan 
and the United States has revealed that the missiles can use 
mobile launching platforms as well. Because the missiles are so 
large, however, it is said that they cannot be launched from a 
sea vessel. 
  The Defense Agency at present assumes the range of the 
Nodong-I to be about 1,000 km, and it has made public the 
results of its analysis which indicate that all of Japan, with 
the exception of only part of Hokkaido, lies within this range. 
  Even when the Nodong-I missiles become mobile, their range 
will not change much, but because they will not use fixed 
missile bases, it is thought that it will be difficult to 
predict from where the missiles will be launched. 
  Furthermore, because North Korea is proceeding to place its 
military facilities underground, a top Defense Agency official 
said, "It will become difficult for the U.S. Armed Forces to 
attack the missile facilities even if they want to."

  [Text] Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata issued a statement on 
20 December that victory of communists and ultra-rightists in 
the Russian parliamentary elections does not affect Japanese 
policy to support President Boris Yeltsin's economic reform. 
  Commenting on the landslide victory of the ultra-right 
Liberal Democratic Party led by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Hata 
noted "that was partly because the Russian public is very 
frustrated with the present circumstances of the reform process." 
  On that ground, He stressed: "Japan strongly hopes all 
members of the new Russian parliament will demonstrate their 
sense of responsibility to both the Russian public and the 
international community, and further promote the nation's reform 
efforts." In conclusion, he added: "There is absolutely no 
change in Japan's policy to offer appropriate assistance to 
Russia's reform efforts."

  [Text] Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, in 
an informal meeting with reporters at the Foreign Ministry on 22 
December, spoke about Japan's role in the United Nations, and 
said Japan should increase its voice in the international 
community by becoming a permanent member of the UN Security 
Council [UNSC]. She said: "As the international community sees 
it, Japan is already a power. The country should make better 
use of the United Nations in every meaning." 
  Regarding a survey mission the Foreign Ministry plans to 
send 
to the former Yugoslavia, she said, "Even the simple fact that 
Japanese will be actually going to the site has meaning in 
itself." 
  Referring to the question of making contributions to the 
former Yugoslavia, meanwhile, a source in the Foreign Ministry 
said on the same day that "if for preventive diplomacy in 
Macedonia, there should be many ways of doing it from the 
humanitarian viewpoint." [phrase as published] Thus, the source 
revealed that the ministry is also willing to send a survey 
mission to Macedonia to probe the possibility of providing 
assistance.

  [Text] U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali met with 
Kazuo Aichi, director general of the Defense Agency, and Yohei 
Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], 
separately in Tokyo on 21 December. 
  Speaking about U.N. peacekeeping operations (PKO) in the 
meeting, Aichi expressed willingness to cooperate in the PKO 
efforts, saying: "The Defense Agency wants to participate in the 
United Nations' activities as much as possible." Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali expressed his hope for Japan's 
contributions, saying: "Japan's participation is desirable, if 
only in symbolic forms, to help the United Nations strengthen 
itself in the long term." 
  In the meeting with LDP President Kono, Butru-Ghali spoke 
about the issue of nuclear inspection of North Korea. He said 
he is willing to play the role of an intermediary between the 
United States and North Korea, saying: "If North Korea wants to 
hold talks with the United States, I am willing to convey its 
intention to the United States."

  [Text] YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide survey on 18 
and 19 December regarding the government's decision to partially 
open Japan's rice market. In the survey, 8 percent of those 
questioned termed the decision "reasonable" and 69 percent 
called it "unavoidable," making a total of 77 percent who found 
the decision acceptable. The results clarify that more than 
three-fourths of the people accept the government's decision. 
However, 19.4 percent "opposed" it. Asked if Japan should 
accept rice tariffication after a six-year grace period, during 
which time the market will be partially open, 43 percent of the 
respondents said "tariffication should not be accepted," while 
as many as 35 percent said "it should be accepted." The results 
show that public acceptance of liberalizing Japan's rice market 
is on the rise. 
  In a similar poll in October, 62 percent supported opening 
the rice market and 30 percent opposed. The results cannot be 
compared directly with those of this month's survey because the 
December survey asked specifically about the partial opening of 
the market. Nonetheless, in this month's survey 22 percent of 
those who "opposed" the partial opening said "rice tariffication 
should be accepted" after the six-year grace period. This may 
mean those who oppose the partial opening do so because they 
want the market to be fully opened. Also, as many as 50 percent 
of those who are in the agricultural, forestry, and fisheries 
industries called the partial opening "unavoidable." 
  When asked about how they think the partial opening will 
affect Japanese rice farming, the majority said "the structure 
of rice farming will be improved," while 44 percent said "rice 
farming will be on the decline." 
  In response to other questions, more than 70 percent said 
"ensuring the safety of imported rice will be a major problem;" 
62 percent said rice, the staple food in Japan, "will steadily 
be supplied;" and 70 percent said "there will be little change" 
in rice prices.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Farm Policies Should Support </F>
Independence-Oriented Farmers"] 
  [Text] Japan has finally accepted partial liberalization 
of the rice market and tariffication of all other farm products 
at the GATT multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay Round). 
Following this, the government established the "Headquarters 
for Emergency Farm Policies." The headquarters is headed by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and other seats are filled by 
all cabinet ministers except the justice and defense ministers. 
We hope the all-star team steadily promotes farm policy reform 
without losing its direction. 
  Under the current farm policy, rice farmers cannot freely 
seek expansion of their businesses due to the government's rice 
paddy reduction and food control policies. They have to cope 
with imported rice under such handicaps. Even without this 
disadvantage, rice farming is often said to be the least 
attractive job for young people. The government is probably 
planning new subsidies to rice farmers, but they would never 
take effect unless these restrictions are removed. 
  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] 
compiled a policy report in 1992: "New Direction of Food and 
Farm Policies (or the so-called New Policies)." The report says 
that, in the year 2000, 80 percent of the nation's rice output 
should be produced by 50,000 large-scale rice farmers who 
cultivate rice paddies of 10 to 20 hectares, 100,000 part-time 
farmers who cultivate five to 10 hectares, and 20,000 organized 
farmers. This seems to be a very drastic objective since the 
average size of rice paddies owned by individual farmers is only 
0.7 hectare right now. 
  To achieve the objective, the speed of farm transactions 
should be accelerated by 250 percent compared to the present 
level. This means great numbers of farmers scale down or quit 
their farming business to concentrate on the nation's farmlands 
to large-scale farmers. Now that a considerable percentage of 
farmers is becoming old or doing farming as its side business, 
the opportunity is going to be ripe for a drastic farmland 
reform. The New Policies report predicts a drastic increase of 
"nonfarmer landowners." 
<H5>  Farmlands Should Be Given to Motivated Farmers </H5>
  Even if a number of landowners give up farming, this would 
not immediately result in an increase of large-scale farmers. 
Also, productivity would not improve when farmers have to work 
on undeveloped and scattered rice paddies. Of late, many 
farmlands are offered for rent, but most of them are left 
deserted with no tenants. Concentration of farmlands to 
motivated farmers is becoming the biggest issue of Japan's farm 
administration. 
  The limitation of compulsory rice production control was 
highlighted this year by a drastic decrease in the rice crop. 
Japan cannot abandon the rice paddy cut policy until it accepts 
the rice tariffication because the "existence of effective 
production control measures" is a prerequisite of GATT's special 
treatment for Japan's rice. Even under the GATT restriction, 
however, it is still possible to give farmers a "freedom of 
choice" whether or not they accept rice paddy reduction. The 
government can offer compensation to those who accept the 
government policy, but those who do not want to cut their 
production should be allowed to deal with the market at their 
own risk. 
  Rice farmers are extremely frustrated with the production 
control policy. While the government intends to relax the 
policy for a while to cope with the rice shortfall, imports of 
foreign-grown rice will certainly bring about oversupply of rice 
again. Under such circumstances, none of the Japanese rice 
farmers can be a motivated farmer. 
  To back implementation of the New Policies, the government 
has enacted the Farm Management Reinforcement Law. Under the 
law, each local government body is allowed to designate the 
region's leading farmers as "approved farmers" for public 
support. As a tentative measure, the freedom of choice should 
be given at least to these approved farmers. 
  While agricultural cooperatives have been enforcing the rice 
paddy cut policy in a tie-up with the government, some of them 
are beginning to break up with the government to protest its 
decision on the rice market liberalization. This is a chance to 
correct questioned ties between agricultural cooperative and the 
administrative branch. 
  The New Policies report does not touch on the revision of 
the Food Control Law since the report was compiled in the midst 
of the Uruguay Round negotiations. However, reform of the food 
control system is an indispensable condition for further 
development of Japanese agriculture. The food control system 
started immediately after World War II to protect consumers 
suffering from a food shortage. However, it has already been 
changed into a tool to protect producers. Yet, the system 
presently restricts producers' business activities, too. 
  The rice farmers' weak point is that they have no say in the 
price of their own products. Distribution of farm products is 
usually concentrated to agricultural cooperatives, but, except 
for rice, farmers are allowed to sell their own products 
directly to consumers. However, the law prohibits rice farmers 
from selling or deciding prices of their own product except for 
one exception called the special purpose rice. 
  A town in Nagano Prefecture has a farmers' production group 
which is designated by the government as a model of independent 
farming bodies. The group has its own rice retail shop. 
However, the law requires the farmers to sell their own rice 
after repurchasing from local agricultural cooperatives -- at 
least on the invoice. The procedure pushes up the price of rice 
sold there. Even in the model group, farmers cannot freely sell 
their own rice. Under such circumstances, can the food control 
system really protect interests of consumers? 
<H5>  Food Control Law Must Be Drastically Revised </H5>
  The MAFF reportedly intends to seek the minimum revision of 
the Food Control Law. But this would not motivate farmers. We 
urge the MAFF to drastically revise the law to create rice 
farming for the 21st Century. 
  To secure a younger farming population, it is necessary to 
encourage young people's entrance into the farming business 
regardless of whether they are from a farmer's family or not. 
The government has to prove that farming is a business they can 
be proud of. At the same time, the government is supposed to 
consider financial support for highly educated but landless 
farmers, following a successful subsidy system in France. 
  Also, the government must take appropriate measures to 
promote farming in mountain villages, where farmers have 
regional disadvantages, for improving their productivity. In 
line with the New Policies report, the government enacted a 
special law in September to support farming in 1,700 local 
government bodies, whose productivity is relatively low. Yet, 
farm subsidies would not be enough. A new farm policy to 
vitalize these regions should be discussed as a combination of 
all existing regional development policies, as well as new 
measures. The government is expected to drastically review all 
policies for these regions, and to hammer out new comprehensive 
measures overcoming bureaucratic sectionalism. 
  In that case, the government is supposed to attach 
importance 
to the creativity of local communities. This is because 
communities must have authority and financial resources to carve 
their way to the future at their own risk. The government 
should reconsider why local government bodies welcomed the 
former Takeshita administration's decision to allot 100 million 
yen to each local government with no restriction on purposes for 
expenditure.

  [Text] The Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) 
compiled its 1994 [as published] JETRO white paper on 20 
December. According to the white paper's chapter on investment, 
the world's direct foreign investment (on the basis of 
international balance of payments) for 1992 decreased by 14.2 
percent over the previous year to $158 billion two years in a 
row due to an investment drop in Japan and Europe where the 
economy has been sluggish. 
  Japan's direct foreign investment (on the basis of 
international balance of payments) drastically dropped by 43.9 
percent from the previous year to $17.2 billion. Japan, which 
had enjoyed first place in direct foreign investment for three 
years since 1989, sharply slid to the fourth place. Meanwhile, 
the United States, which positively invested in Latin America 
and Asia, ranked first for the first time in six years since 
1986. U.S. direct foreign investment (on the same basis) 
increased by 19.5 percent to $34.7 billion in 1992. 
  Among the reasons cited by JETRO for the decrease in Japan's 
direct foreign investment are: 1) the financial condition of 
companies has worsened following the collapse of the so-called 
bubble economy; 2) profitability of investment has deteriorated 
in Europe and America; and 3) Asian NIES (newly industrializing 
economies) are losing their advantages as a production base 
because of a sharp increase in wages.

  [Text] Prime Minister Hosokawa decided on 24 December to 
begin studying ways to set a new defense buildup guideline to 
replace the "current Guideline for Defense Buildup Plans," a 
basic guideline for Japan's defense buildup. The prime minister 
intends to set up a private advisory body next spring, at the 
earliest, with the task of fully studying ways to formulate 
Japan's comprehensive security. The idea is surfacing that the 
"basic defense buildup plans" aimed at maintaining Japan's 
necessary minimum defense capability in peace time, a 
fundamental philosophy of the current "Guideline," should be 
replaced with new defense buildup plans which are in tune with 
the relaxed international tensions. With the prime minister 
deciding to replace the current "Guideline" with a new one, 
Japan's defense buildup plans based on the current "Guideline" 
that was set in 1976, will face a turning point. 
  The current "Guideline" features a call for the shift from 
the conventional defense plans designed to cope with external 
threat to the "basic defense buildup plans." An attached table 
of the "Guideline" set the fixed number of troops for the Ground 
Self-Defense Force at 180,000, and mainstay military hardware 
and organizations for three services of the Self-Defense Forces. 
  Former Prime Minister Miyazawa announced that his government 
would review the current "Guideline" in 1995, but he did not 
think of changing the basic defense buildup plans. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa has been eager to set the direction 
of reviewing the current "Guideline" as soon as possible in 
light of the dramatically changed international situation 
following the collapse of the Cold War structure. 
  The Defense Agency [DA] has already inaugurated the "Study 
Group for Discussion of Japan's Defense in the 21st Century" 
consisting of pundits in various fields with the intention of 
compiling a defense budget for fiscal year 1996 based on a new 
guideline. The DA, which set up a research council consisting of 
defense experts, originally planned to place the council under 
the Defense Agency director general, but it later decided to 
shelve the plan and cooperate with the prime minister by 
"elevating" the council to a private advisory body for him. 
  The prime minister envisions the private advisory body as a 
body like the Economic Reform Research Council (the Hiraiwa 
Council, says a government source). A plan is under examination 
to organize the private advisory body with a dozen former DA 
officials and Foreign Ministry officials. Former Defense Agency 
Vice Minister Seiki Nishihiro is surfacing as a member of the 
body.

  [Text] The Defense Agency [DA] has decided to move up the 
time of reviewing the "Japan Defense Buildup Plan Guideline," 
the basic guideline for the defense buildup in Japan, to firm up 
the outline of a new guideline by the end of 1994. The DA has 
decided to do so in response to Prime Minister Hosokawa's strong 
intention of attaching great importance to changes taken place 
in the international situation since the end of the Cold War. 
The review's results will be reflected in the 1995 budget. The 
DA plans to make a speedy full-fledged review of the current 
guideline by setting up a deliberation council consisting of 
security and foreign affairs experts next spring. In the new 
proposal for replacing the "Strengthening Defense Capability 
Plan," which is based on the current guideline, cuts in the 
fixed number of Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF] personnel and 
redefining Japan's participation in the UN Peacekeeping 
Operations (PKO) are likely to be focal points. 
  The Cabinet decided on the "Japan Defense Buildup Plan 
Guideline" in 1976 and the prime minister has shown enthusiasm 
for an early review of it, saying, "The guideline was shaped 
under the Cold War structure and it has become necessary to 
review whether it is compatible with the needs of the present 
day." On 24 December, the prime minister told Yamakuchi, House 
of Representatives Budget Committee chairman, that "I have 
already directed the DA to review the guideline and I intend to 
have the review results reflected in the 1995 budget." 
  What the DA has thus far planned is that it will set the new 
guideline's outline in March 1995 and make a final decision on 
it by the end of 1995. However, the DA has decided to move up 
the review time of the current guideline after concluding that 
it will be unable to have the results of the review ready in 
time for the compilation of the 1995 budget. 
  As the situation has continued wherein the number of GSDF 
personnel falls below its fixed number of 180,000, which is set 
in the current guideline's "attached list," the DA is likely to 
shrink the fixed number of GSDF personnel to the current level 
of 150,000 when it reviews the guideline. The DA also plans to 
include the use of SDF reserves in the new guideline. In the 
new guideline, the DA intends to stress the posture of 
vigorously participating in the PKO. Regarding the theater 
missile defense that the United States is promoting, meanwhile, 
the DA is expected to refer to it in one way or another in the 
new guideline. In the new guideline, the DA is likely to 
forward a new defense policy by sweepingly changing the 
conventional way of analyzing the international situation on the 
premise of confrontation between two superpowers, the United 
States and Soviet Union. 
  In late 1994, however, a preliminary budget request for 
fiscal 1995 will be decided and it is hard to predict to what 
extent the new guideline will be reflected in a budget bill for 
fiscal 1995. The deliberation council is likely to begin a 
full-fledged review after a budget bill for fiscal 1994 is 
enacted. Any delay in the budget bill's enactment is expected 
to force the deliberation council to draw a conclusion on the 
new guideline by the end of 1994 after six months of review. 
  DA officials are voicing doubts about the prime minister's 
posture, saying, "The prime minister is in too much of a hurry," 
(says a senior DA official). Some DA officials think that the 
prime minister probably aims to appease the ruling Social 
Democratic Party of Japan, which has insisted on cutting defense 
spending.

<F P=106> [Article by political critic Toichi Suzuki: "Aim Is the </F>
Postponement of the Dissolution of the Diet Until January -- 
Hosokawa Cabinet Attempts Simultaneous Breakthroughs on 
Political Reform and Recession Countermeasures"] 
  [Text]Rice and Consumption Tax Are Involved 
  Just prior to 15 December, the Hosokawa cabinet, which had 
been enjoying smooth sailing, ran into a great crisis. This was 
the day of the deadline for the GATT Uruguay Round. On 7 
December, Chairman Denis' revised proposal arrived, and Prime 
Minister Hosokawa accepted the proposal according to which "we 
will agree to a six-year deferral of total tariffication [on 
rice imports], and during this period we will allow minimum 
access (a minimum volume of imports, 4 percent [of the market] 
the first year, 8 percent the last year)." 
  This is an old, shopworn method by which "one officially 
opposes, but in the end gives in to gaiatsu [external pressure] 
and reluctantly agrees." But the prime minister himself cannot 
shift responsibility since he has repeatedly said that he would 
abide by the "Diet resolutions." The Diet resolutions advocate 
a "totally domestic supply." 
  Besides rice, there is the problem of countermeasures to 
improve business conditions, with which in particular an 
increase in the consumption tax is combined. The widespread 
argument is that a 5-10 trillion yen consumption tax [increase] 
would be an effective measure to improve economic conditions. 
As a source of revenue, a deficit-covering national bond is 
popular within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). But the 
Finance Ministry, as well as Shinseito and Komeito, argues that 
"it is irresponsible unless, at the same time, we decide the 
income tax reduction, we decide to raise the consumption tax 
rate at some specific time a few years from now." They fear 
that if we do not raise the consumption tax rate, there is the 
prospect of "eat and run" [a situation where one takes the 
benefit first and does not pay the price]. In the background, 
there is also an ulterior motive of "letting Hosokawa take care 
of all the difficult issues, such as rice and the consumption 
tax." 
  The Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) took the 
combination of rice and the consumption tax most seriously. The 
SDPJ is, due in part to being the inheritor of the farmers' 
movement, sensitive to the rice issue. The three senior party 
officers, headed by Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, declared their 
opposition on 7 December, saying that "the acceptance of partial 
liberalization is contrary to the agreement of the eight parties 
which formed the coalition government." 
  Moreover, as the budget is drawn up, if a consumption tax 
rate hike is included, the SDPJ's resistance will be even 
stronger. It was only a few years ago when the SDPJ experienced 
an overwhelming victory in a national election under Chairperson 
Takako Doi who opposed the consumption tax, saying that "when it 
will not do, it will not do." One of the Komeito executives 
said that "this is a crisis under which the SDPJ could split up, 
but at the same time, there is a chance it could leave the 
coalition government. To begin with, there are some people in 
the SDPJ who have an allergic reaction to Ozawa. The party, 
which essentially stands for demilitarization and neutrality, 
could never go along with revision of the Constitution and the 
overseas dispatch of Self-Defense Forces. A desire to change 
the party to avoid being controlled by Ozawa exists naturally in 
the left wing of the party, but also in the right wing." 
  Would the SDPJ still cling to government power and choose to 
stay on, holding cabinet posts? Or would they dissolve the 
coalition? It is not necessary to explain how severe the blow 
would be to the Hosokawa Cabinet, if the SDPJ, the largest party 
in the government, were to pull out. 
<H5>  Passage of Political Reform Bill Will Be Difficult </H5>
  The end of the extraordinary Diet session is 15 December. It 
is also the deadline day the Hosokawa Cabinet, which publicly 
promised the "passage of a political reform bill before the end 
of this year." As of 8 December, the bill, which passed the 
House of Representatives on 18 November in an ordinary manner, 
remains in the House of Councillors without even recitation 
(explanation of purpose) taking place. Probably they will not 
be able to start actual deliberation until the 15th. 
  The biggest factor for such a delay is that in the House of 
Councillors, the LDP and SDPJ conspired behind the scenes and 
adopted joint efforts in an attempt at delay. Especially in the 
proportional districts of the SDPJ, there is strong opposition 
to the single seat election district system and to the House of 
Representatives' proposal on proportional representation, which 
is identical to that of the House of Councillors. 
  Moreover, the speed of the drop in business conditions has 
far exceeded the Hosokawa Cabinet's forecast. It was reported 
that the unemployment rate in October jumped up to 2.7 percent, 
and is still showing an upward trend, according to a Labor 
Ministry study. The Hosokawa Cabinet was thinking that "first, 
we will complete political reform, then we will start on 
economic countermeasures." But it has become clear that there is 
no progress on political reform, and they have been slow to 
respond with countermeasures for the economic conditions. 
Voices have been heard within elements of the government 
regretting that "they made a mistake in priorities." 
WARNING: JAPANESE MEDIA PROJECT 
  Moreover, two unanticipated incidents occurred which 
stopped discussions in the House of Representatives Budget 
Committee. One was the comment Defense Agency Director General 
Keisuke Nakanishi made concerning revision of the Constitution. 
Director General Nakanishi resigned mainly on the pretext that 
he could not delay deliberations. 
  The other incident involved Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
relationship with Sagawa Express. A fuss was raised about the 
"composition of the repayment" of 100 million yen Hosokawa 
borrowed from Chairman Kiyoshi Sagawa. At first, Prime Minister 
Hosokawa answered that "I took the cash and repayed it. I used 
40-50 million yen out of 70 million yen separation pay from my 
governorship." Mr. Hakuo Yanagisawa of the LDP took a point by 
saying that "the Prime Minister said he had repayed in full by 
the end of January 1991, but he served as governor until 
February, and did not receive his separation pay in January." 
The prime minister further submitted a document on 7 December 
stating that "he paid it back 10 million yen annually over 10 
years." But the LDP objected that "it differs from the answer 
he gave before," and sought further detailed explanation. So 
deliberations were delayed until the 8th. There, many people 
who say in the LDP that "Hosokawa insists the money he was given 
as a gift was a loan, and he says he repayed it even though he 
has not. That is where the inconsistencies come from. This is 
similar to the case of Finance Minister Miyazawa. Mr. Miyazawa 
made a false reply that he did not receive Recruit stocks, 
though in fact he did. He was cross-examined and pressed into 
resignation." There are also voices that "we can get 
Hosokawa's head any time" [to get him to resign]. Secretary 
General Mori and the party executives have not yet made up their 
minds." But the LDP executives' plan seems to be as follows: 
  "Because the supplemental budget is an important 
countermeasure for dealing with economic conditions, we must get 
it passed through the House of Councillors by 15 December, which 
is the end of the session. For that reason, we will not pursue 
Hosokawa further, even though we are not satisfied with the 
answer he has given. Besides, if the supplemental budget does 
not pass this session, it will result in giving an excuse for 
the coalition government to extend the session." 
  This makes it appear as if the LDP, which secretly conspired 
with the SDPJ, has taken the leadership for Diet management. 
The LDP, which only 20 days earlier was in terrible shape, 
plagued with a number of rebellious members and facing the 
crisis of a possible split, is now filled with a triumphant mood 
because the chance for passing the political reform bill before 
the end of this year is completely gone. 
<H3>  Ozawa and Takemura Debate Over "Cross-Year" [extending the 
Diet session so that it carries over from 1993 into 1994] </H3>
  It has been reported that in early December, Mr. Ichiro 
Ozawa, senior Shinseito representative, and Masayoshi Takemura, 
the chief cabinet secretary, met for discussion and had a clash 
of opinions. Mr. Takemura insisted as follows: 
  "There is a severe downturn in business conditions. We want 
to designate the political reform bill a matter of deliberation 
to be carried over and to close the curtain on the extraordinary 
Diet session. We want to pour our full efforts into 
countermeasures to boost economic conditions and into developing 
the budget for Heisei 6 (1994)." 
  Mr. Ozawa was said to be furiously opposed to such an 
argument. 
  "What are you talking about? The carry-over [of discussion] 
of the bill is the same as abandoning the bill. As we publicly 
promised, we must get it passed, whatever it takes. We can open 
the regular Diet session on 30 January. We can extend the 
[extraordinary session] until 29 January. We should be able to 
concurrently handle the bill on the political reform and the 
formation of the budget." 
  This is Mr. Ozawa's argument for the crossing-over the year 
extension. Mr. Takemura's is the common sensical argument. Mr. 
Ozawa's is a strong-armed, unprecedented plan. The following 
House of Representatives Administrative Office comment shows 
that. 
  "Since last year, the ordinary Diet was to be convened in 
January. But prior to that, it was convened in December and in 
the latter part of the month entered into a regular New Year's 
recess. It was reconvened in the latter part of January when the 
budget was printed. They almost never had any actual 
deliberation in January. The exception was that year before last 
(1991), on 18 January, the regular session was convened to deal 
with crisis countermeasures related to the Gulf war. Other than 
that, there has been no precedent for actual deliberation before 
20 January." 
  It seems that the Diet is always in recess during the New 
Year's period, and the politicians participate in various 
activities and meetings in their districts. I do not believe 
that the House of Councillors will respond to January 
deliberations. 
  Then, why do Mr. Ozawa and others in Shinseito venture to 
advocate the crossing-over the year extension? Frankly 
speaking, that is because they are aiming at dissolution in the 
latter part of January. Shinseito Secretary Hajime Ishii 
explains as follows: 
  "If we start on 10 January, we have as much as three 
weeks left. We should give up the year end and the New Year 
holidays and tackle the political problems. First, we should 
propose a large scale tax cut for the benefit of better business 
conditions. With the budget's current scale, prospects for the 
immediate future are dismal. We must bravely fight for the 
benefit of better economic conditions and adopt good measures 
for it, and then dissolve the Diet. By dissolving the Diet, the 
second realignment in the political world will occur, and the 
way to political reform will pave itself." 
  They believe that the passage of the bill in the House of 
Councillors will be difficult even if the session is 
substantially extended. What worries them additionally is the 
recession's continuation. Criticism is expected to the effect 
that dissolution of the Diet at this time "will delay the 
passage of the regular budget by nearly two months. This is 
against the wishes of the Japanese people, which is that [the 
government work on] measures to tackle the recession. Then they 
are to "come up with countermeasures for the economy, namely, a 
large scale tax cut and a third supplemental budget." 
  But even if they put up an "ad balloon," actual 
implementation will be delayed during that period [nearly two 
months needed for the dissolution, election, and formation of a 
cabinet]. There are also many questions, such as where the 
source of revenue to make up for the tax cut will be found. 
Among the government parties themselves, there are many 
critical voices against this long extension of the session. One 
of the Komeito leaders says the following: 
  "One of the issues is that the budget will be made in 
January 
and passage will be [further] delayed. As a consequence, it 
will have to be a provisional budget. I question the wisdom 
during such a time of recession. Second is that in the midst of 
the Diet session, the preliminary plan made out by the Finance 
Ministry for the 1994 budget will be submitted, so each 
committee [in the Diet] will have to deliberate on this. In the 
past, the LDP Policy Research Council meddled with the Finance 
Ministry plan, but this time the Diet committees will make 
demands. The preliminary plan will be greatly altered. Despite 
the fact that the government has the right to make the budget, 
the Diet will interfere. The government cannot respond to this. 
It is impossible to simultaneously handle political reform 
deliberation and budget making." 
<H5>  Mr. Ibuki's Argument for Early Dissolution of the Diet </H5>
  The argument for the cross-over the year extension also 
contains the strategy for a January dissolution in the event the 
political reform [bill] fails to pass. As if to respond to 
this, within the LDP there is also a voice for a January 
dissolution. That is the pet theory of Mr. Bunmei Ibuki, the 
deputy chairman of the LDP Diet Affairs Committee. He has also 
been advocating early dissolution to Diet Affairs Committee 
Chairman Sadatoshi Ozato. But Mr. Ozato wonders about this, 
saying, "I do not understand his point very well." When I 
questioned Mr. Ibuki, the following answer came back: 
  "There is a phenomenon of distortion in the political world 
today. Mr. Ozawa of the coalition government and Mr. Michio 
Watanabe of the LDP share conception and policies, but Mr. 
Ozawa, Prime Minister Hosokawa, and SDPJ Chairman Murayama do 
not. Because of this unnatural and unfortunate distortion 
phenomenon, they [in the coalition government] also can not 
agree on an economic counter-plan and can not take any effective 
measures. If nothing is done, the situation will develop into 
the Heisei Panic. It is not fair to the Japanese people. 
Therefore, I propose that the coalition government should take 
a temporary truce on political reform and seek cooperation from 
the LDP outside the cabinet. The LDP also proposes that it will 
cooperate on a counter-plan for the recession." 
  I understand up to this point. 
  "There are various arguments concerning political reform, 
and 
in both the coalition government parties and in the LDP there 
are distortions. It is also necessary to solve this situation 
to build a healthy two-party system. Today, numbers mean 
everything. The coalition parties have not formed the 
government because of their compatible policies. I want this to 
be straightened out. That is why I keep insisting that we 
should keep the medium size electoral district system and go for 
dissolution. If we go into election with the single 
constituency electoral district system, then the distortion will 
never be corrected." 
  It appears that his argument for the dissolution has an 
ulterior motive for realigning the political world. What Mr. 
Ibuki left unsaid, Mr. Jiro Kawasaki, another deputy chairman of 
the Diet Affairs Committee, supplemented as follows. 
  "Mr. Ibuki is racking his brains on how to realize Michee 
Watanabe's assumption of the prime ministership. I wonder if he 
would leave the party, with Watanabe in the lead, using 
dissolution as the opportunity. I wonder if he is considering a 
government by Watanabe, Ozawa, and Ichikawa." 
  His surmise is that they cannot wait out President Kono's 
two- year term and that their strategy is to bring Mr. Watanabe 
in as candidate for coalition chief after Prime Minister 
Hosokawa has failed. There are many people who doubt this 
theory. One Komeito senior official points out the following: 
  "In addition to his ill health, Michee Watanabe's image is 
just too different from that of Mr. Hosokawa. He could become a 
prime minister with popularity of nearly zero." 
  A Shinseito senior official concurs: 
  "It is no longer Watanabe's time. His face, constitution, 
and career are just too old. Beside, can he get out [of the 
LDP] taking 20-30 people? If 20-30 people leave, then it is 
significant that the LDP will become a permanent opposition 
party." 
  Thus, with the cross-over the year extension debate and 
January dissolution argument at the center, the counter-plan for 
dealing with the recession, rice, and the consumption tax are 
all tangled together. And the political situation is creaking 
as it turns.

  [Text] Suspicion that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
borrowed 100 million yen from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. grew big 
and became one of the focal points regarding the extended Diet 
session. Saying "we cannot understand at all the prime 
minister's explanations because they sound unnatural and 
unreasonable," both Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Japan 
Communist Party [JCP] plan to intensively question, during the 
Diet session, the prime minister to reveal details of how he 
borrowed the 100 million yen and repayed the money afterwards. 
On the other hand, the prime minister submitted relevant 
documents and a letter of explanation to a council of the lower 
house Budget Committee on 15 December. Because of this, he plans 
to refuse demands from the LDP and JCP, saying that "groundless 
suspicion will be dispelled completely." Since the prime 
minister gave different answers to parliamentary 
interpellations, many members of the ruling parties are worried 
that the issue may develop into a scandal. It is possible that 
the issue of 100 billion yen may have fatal impact on 
deliberation of political reform bills should the prime minister 
fail to handle it correctly. It may also develop into an issue 
of whether he must resign or continue to remain in his post. 
Therefore, the prime minister's close associates are feeling a 
growing sense of crisis. 
  Regarding the issue of 100 million yen, both the LDP and JCP 
are deepening their suspicion. A senior LDP member said: "It 
is a lie that he borrowed the money. The truth is that the 
money was an illegal contribution from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. In 
short, he was given the money." 
  The prime minister said, in the documents and during his 
responses to questions at the lower house Budget Committee, that 
he had borrowed the 100 million yen to buy an apartment in Tokyo 
and to repair plaster walls and a temple gate of his house, 
which is designated as a cultural asset, in Kumamoto. He also 
explained that he signed a loan contract in October 1982. 
However, he purchased the apartment house in Tokyo at the price 
of 75 million yen in July before signing the loan contract, and 
repair work started from six months to nearly one year after 
signing the contract. Both the LDP and the JCP are saying that 
"we cannot possibly believe the prime minister's explanations." 
  Moreover, what invited fierce objections from both parties 
were six documents (all of which are copies and the originals 
were confiscated by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors 
Office) and a letter, which explains the contents of the 
documents. The prime minister submitted the documents to the 
Budget Committee, saying: "They were supplied by Sagawa Kyubin." 
  Some of the documents are: 1) A copy of the loan contract 
signed between the prime minister and Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin on 6 
October 1982. A column for the lender's name on the contract is 
left out blank; 2) A copy of a mortgage contract, signed in 
1982, with blank columns for lender's name and date of signing. 
The contract holds a mortgage on the prime minister's villa in 
Yugawara-cho in Kanagawa Prefecture; 3) A copy of an unsealed 
receipt, which was issued when the prime minister returned 10 
million yen to Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin on 31 January 1990; and 4) 
Copies of Sagawa Kyubin's written notices, dated 15 December 
1982 and 28 March 1983, for interest payment schedules. They 
were addressed to the prime minister but an accountant's seal on 
the written notices was blacked out. 
  The LDP suspects that they are forged documents, saying that 
"we cannot possibly believe that the receipts without seals, the 
written papers with blacked-out seals, and other papers are real 
accounting documents," (according to a senior member of the LDP 
Diet Policy Committee). On the basis of Clause 104 of the Diet 
Act, the party plans to call for a submission of the original 
documents to the lower house Budget Committee. At the same 
time, the LDP will press for summoning the prime minister's 
former Secretary Masatoshi Fukayama to the Diet to testify as a 
witness. 
  Due to the prime minister's explanations, which change every 
day, people are deepening their suspicion. At the Budget 
Committee meeting, he repeatedly corrected his explanations 
regarding details of the loan repayment schedule and on repair 
of the plaster walls and the gate. The prime minister, when it 
came to a critical part, refused to answer questions, saying: 
"I do not remember the details because I entrust my office with 
the task of taking care of everything." Such responses at Diet 
interpellations give us the impression that the issue of the 100 
million yen loan is a suspicious case.

<F P=106> [Article by Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of NEC Corporation: </F>
"Is the United States Really Fair?"] 
  [Text] The decade between 1980 and 1989 was really a 
period of upheaval. The change was so great that Professor John 
K. Galbraith even called it "The Age of Uncertainty." The 
situation worsened in the 1990s, since everything became 
unpredictable. In my opinion, we are now living in a period of 
"social diastrophism" that is creating all sorts of gaps. 
  With respect to the industrial world, we have already faced 
many crises in the past, such as the Nixon shock, the first oil 
shock, the second oil shock, and the influence of the strong yen 
on the export-dependent Japanese economy. Drawing on our 
resources, we were able to tide over each of these crises. 
  When the value of the yen against the dollar came close to 
100 yen recently, I was as scared as if a guided missile had 
been launched against Japan. Japanese high-technology industry 
will indeed suffer catastrophic damage from a sudden 
appreciation of the yen, as if it had been attacked by a 
missile. In February, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen. 
Then, it plunged about 20 percent in a very short period of 
time. Under such circumstances, our business will not be 
viable. The rise of the yen against the dollar is at the root 
of the current recession. Of course, this is not the only 
cause, but there is no doubt that the strong yen is weighing 
considerably against the national economy. 
  In discussions about the appreciation of the yen, nine 
people 
out of ten have no doubt that the yen's rise is encouraged by 
Japan's trade surplus, and they are generally sticking fast to 
their opinion. Is what they say really true? 
  In September 1985, the dollar was quoted at around 240 yen. 
In its trade with the United States, Japan marked a surplus of 
11.9 billion dollars in the fourth quarter of that year. When I 
met Carla Hills, the then U.S. Trade Representative, toward the 
end of 1991, we were just then informed that Japan's trade 
surplus with the United States had totaled 11.7 billion dollars 
(figure announced at that time by the government) in the third 
quarter. And the value of the yen against the dollar was 
between 120 and 130. These figures clearly show that the trade 
imbalance between Japan and the United States had remained 
basically unchanged despite the high appreciation of the yen. 
  Despite these facts, Director C. Fred Bergsten of the 
Institute for International Economics, who is reportedly a 
prominent economic brain trustee of U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
still reiterates the need for a stronger yen. "International 
cooperation, such as the introduction of a reference range, is 
needed to promote a rise up to 110 yen, or even up to 100 yen, 
in the value of the yen, to bring down Japan's trade surplus," 
Bergstan said, when he came to Tokyo in February 1993 to give a 
lecture. 
  According to his theory, if the yen rises at an annual rate 
of one percent against the dollar, Japan's current trade surplus 
with the United States will be cut by one billion dollars in two 
years. If that is the case, will the surplus decrease by 10 
billion dollars, with a 10 percent rise of the yen, which is 
equivalent to a fall of the dollar by 10 yen? That cannot be. 
Professor Lester C. Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology is also very emphatic about the necessity of 
improving the value of the yen up to 100 yen. How can such a 
view remain unchallenged? 
  It is because all trade statistics have always been valued 
in 
dollars. If dollars are converted into yen, the quarterly value 
of Japan's trade surplus with the United States in 1985 would be 
equivalent to some 2.5 trillion yen. This year, the same value 
would have dropped to some 1.1 trillion yen. Everyone can read 
in newspapers that in other countries, like France or Germany, 
trade imbalances are valued in their currencies; that is to say 
in French francs or in Deutsche marks. Japan is the only 
country using the dollar from beginning to end. 
<H5>  `The Yen-Valued World' and `the Dollar-Valued World' </H5>
  The French or the German case is just one example. What I 
would like to emphasize most is the importance of fact-finding. 
People should speak out only after shaping their ideas based on 
facts. Let me give one or two more examples. 
  A famous Japanese economic analyst told me: "In the early 
1980s, Japan's national defense spending was criticized as being 
too small. However, the attack from other countries gradually 
eased in the latter half of the 1980s, thanks to Japan's 
efforts. As a result, I also escaped being criticized by 
American and European economic analysts, and I could preserve my 
honor." So, I asked him, "Did Japan double the number of its 
military planes or its warships? Did Japan double the number of 
Self-Defense officials?" As a matter of course, that could not 
be. What is certain is that in the latter half of the 1980s, 
the dollar plunged sharply against the yen, from the 240-yen 
level to the 120-yen level, following the Plaza Accord reached 
by the Group of Seven in 1985. Therefore, dollar-valued 
national defense spending has increased considerably. However, 
the rise was more apparent than real. 
  Although he is a well-known economic analyst, he was unable 
to recognize that what had occurred was the result of 
exchange-rate magic. 
  Another example is the gap between domestic and global 
prices, which is often taken up for discussion between Japan and 
the United States. It is really regrettable to see that there 
are so many unsubstantiated arguments that remain unchallenged. 
  For instance, Mr. Bergsten points out that although Japan 
does not impose any import duty on foreign semiconductors, it 
raises nontariff barriers equivalent to 107 percent. Where did 
he get this data? I found that his argument was based on a 
paper written by a Japanese university professor. In his 
original text, the professor said that in Japan, a domestic 
integrated circuit is about twice the price of a foreign 
integrated circuit imported from Taiwan or from a Southeast 
Asian country. However, after a thorough investigation, I 
discovered that the two integrated circuits mentioned in the 
paper were not of the same kind. Mr. Bergsten denounces Japan's 
nontariff barriers using incorrect data obtained from such an 
improper comparison. His argument is totally irrelevant. With 
regard to integrated circuits, Japan is making a great effort to 
increase the purchase of foreign products. If we take these 
efforts into consideration, it is not too much to say that Japan 
is even applying a negative tariff rate on foreign products. 
  By the way, the price of a haircut is 3,500 or 3,600 yen in 
Tokyo. The barber fee has gradually increased since the end of 
the war, with the current of the times. This price will not 
change even if the dollar falls to 100 yen. 
  For example, even if the barber can buy a pair of Solingen 
clippers for 10,000 yen instead of 12,000 yen, thanks to the 
yen's rise, the price of a haircut would never become lower, 
because "the yen-valued world" differs from "the dollar-valued 
world" in real economy. Despite the difference, I have seen 
many comparative lists of commodity prices indicating the barber 
fee in New York and the one in Tokyo, by simply converting yen 
into dollars or dollars into yen. This is really amazing. 
  In 1991, Japan's gross national product was about 470 
trillion yen. The export-import value amounted to 500-odd 
billion dollars, which is equivalent to some 60 trillion yen, at 
an exchange rate of 110 yen against the dollar. This represents 
less than 20 percent of the gross national product. This means 
that the portion that is directly affected by exchange 
fluctuations does not even reach 20 percent of the GNP. More 
than 80 percent of the GNP corresponds to "the yen-valued world." 
  With a wise look, some commentators used to base their 
argument on "the law of indifference," which I find strange, 
when they had to refer to the gap between domestic and global 
prices, during debates on the sudden rise of the yen. For 
example, let us suppose that a Japanese TV set worth 20,000 yen 
was sold at 100 dollars in the United States, when the dollar 
was quoted at 240 yen. I believe no one would have found 
anything strange about that. However, when the dollar dropped 
to 180 yen, people began to put the price gap into question. 
This is because if the same TV set continues to be sold at the 
same price in the United States, its yen-valued price would fall 
to 18,000 yen. There has not been discussion about the gap 
between domestic and global prices, since the dollar reached the 
180-yen level. However, it does not always follow that the 
price gap is caused by the yen's appreciation, since the retail 
price could remain unchanged because of the U.S. distribution 
system. 
  There is now a growing call for economic deregulation. 
Thanks to various efforts, such as the rationalization of 
business routines, the purchasing power parity of the yen 
against the dollar, which was more than 400 yen after the end of 
the war, has already improved to less than 200 yen. Needless to 
say, Japan should continue to make efforts in that direction. 
However, I do not want to see Japanese people repeating the 
foolish mistake of taking the yen's sudden appreciation for 
granted and to accept it without due consideration. The yen's 
rise is nothing but a result of a speculative move made by young 
speculators. The economic fundamentals of "the yen-valued 
world," which corresponds to 80 percent of the national economy, 
are almost not affected by exchange fluctuations. As for "the 
dollar-valued world," which represents the remaining 20 percent, 
even if the value of the yen becomes about 20 percent stronger 
against the dollar in a mere six months, it does not mean that 
its economic fundamentals will also undergo a similar change. 
Such a change is beyond possibility. 
  We are now living in a period of time when it is not 
possible 
for our country to stand by itself. Speaking of Japan's 
relations with the rest of the world, Japan-U.S. relations are 
the most important. 
  I have stressed for a long time that Japan is like a younger 
brother of the United States. After the end of the war, our 
brother helped us out of difficulty. One day, we should return 
the kindness. 
  Meanwhile, if we compare the two brothers, we can see that 
the United States is rather interested in software. Attracting 
many persons of remarkable talent, the United States is already 
living in an age of highly advanced information. This is why 
the percentage of Americans working for manufacturing industries 
is decreasing more and more. According to statistics released 
in 1990, only 16.7 percent of the U.S. working population was 
employed by a manufacturing industry. Meanwhile, Japan 
continues to spend money to buy high-quality software from the 
United States. Thanks to its excellent manufacturing 
technology, it develops new products from U.S.-made software. 
New products are then supplied to the United States. 
  It seems that the United States has finally begun to 
understand this situation. However, discussions between the 
two countries are still not going smoothly. 
  For example, I thought that everything would be resolved 
once Japan and the United States reached agreement following 
ministerial level bilateral talks, such as meetings between the 
Japanese international trade and industry minister or the 
Japanese posts and telecommunications minister and the U.S. 
secretary of commerce or the U.S. trade representative. 
However, things were not so easy. 
<H5>  Japan Has a Masochistic Tendency of Self-Condemnation </H5>
  There is the problem of increasing Japan's purchase of 
foreign semiconductors to more than 20 percent of its market. 
This is a striking example showing the discord between the two 
countries. The text of the new U.S.-Japan Semiconductor 
Agreement states that the Japanese Government "recognizes that 
the U.S. semiconductor industry expects foreign-made chips to 
gain more than a 20 percent share of the Japanese market by the 
end of 1992." However, the text also says clearly, "Both 
governments agreed that this numerical target does not 
constitute a guarantee, a ceiling, or a floor." 
  Despite the contents of the agreement, once the 
semiconductor 
issue comes to the fore, Americans get excited and start talking 
about penalties in the case of failure to meet the target. 
  Although there are only a few Japan-bashers among U.S. 
congressmen, when the matter becomes serious, the United States 
has a tendency to resort to punishment, even if there is no 
basis for it. The Japanese Government as well as the Japanese 
news media should become more conscious of this. They should 
tell people the truth, by calling what is right, right, and what 
is wrong, wrong. 
  I do not know why, but Japanese people have a masochistic 
tendency to immediately take the blame before even trying to 
ascertain the truth, when they are severely criticized by people 
of other countries. Moreover, Japanese people have another 
strange mentality: they are strongly inclined to believe more in 
press reports dispatched from abroad by a Japanese correspondent 
than those compiled by journalists based in Japan. 
  Japan should not let the United States speak as it likes. On 
the contrary, it should answer back in the same way. In certain 
cases, it should be prepared to speak out twice as much as the 
United States; otherwise it will not be able to face this 
country which speaks in a loud voice. Frankly speaking, what 
the United States is doing now is like saying, "You buy this, 
you buy that," with a gun in one hand. In the case of 
semiconductors, the United States has hinted at revival of the 
Super 301 clause of the Omnibus Trade act, if the targeted 20 
percent market share is not achieved. The way the United State 
speaks can be seen as if it wants to intimidate Japan into 
submission. 
  To begin with, the United States should understand that 
marketing is an absorptive phenomenon. It is not because a 
trader has tried hard to intrude an article upon consumers so 
that he will find a big market for it. People will never buy 
articles that do not meet their needs. The desire to buy should 
come first. 
  Now, people often use the word "symbiosis." Among different 
antagonistic parties, which are the two parties which must live 
together in symbiosis? This should be the most important point, 
when we think of symbiosis. The confrontation between producers 
and consumers is never put in question on the occasion of 
international trade disputes. It is the antagonism between 
producers of different countries that is always at issue. 
Consumers are completely neglected during trade negotiations. 
  European and American business leaders say that Japanese 
people work too hard. They criticize Japan's ratio of labor 
income distribution. They also point out that Japanese 
companies have a low pay-out ratio. However, it is not proper 
to overreact to these comments by European and American business 
leaders, without having a critical mind. The pay-out ratio 
increases considerably when companies suffer a decline in profit 
due to a recession. This is quite natural because companies 
continue to pay dividends, despite the decrease in profit. 
instead of raising or lowering the dividend at once, Japanese 
management makes it a practice to increase the dividend 
gradually, so that it can maintain the level even in case of a 
decline in profit. Stability is very important in Japanese 
management. It is very bad if Japanese people are unable to 
give a clear explanation like this. 
  As for the ratio of labor income distribution, it is true 
that there is a gap between Japan and the United States. The 
U.S. ratio is about 80-81 percent, while Japan's ratio is around 
76-77 percent. Japan still has to invest considerably in plants 
and equipment, since it is still based on manufacturing 
industry. Meanwhile the United States, where the service 
industry is already predominant, has no need to spend so much 
money on plants and facilities. If someone wants to comment on 
Japan's ratio of labor income distribution, he should make a 
proper comparison of the two countries, as I did. 
  How can two antagonistic groups coexist? This is the idea of 
symbiosis. For example, we can say that parents and children 
live together in symbiosis, since there is always a certain 
antagonism between them. Although they have a different sense 
of values, they try to overcome the gap to live together happily. 
  Professor William G. Ouchi of the United States has tried 
to clarify Japanese management methods by comparing two types of 
companies; Type A companies versus Type Z companies. Type A is 
a typical company with top-down decisionmaking. Type Z is a 
company having a participative approach to decisionmaking: it 
tries to reach a consensus by listening to what people of minor 
positions say. Originally, Japanese companies had the same 
characteristics as Type Z companies. However, they have now 
changed a little bit because the lifetime employment system is 
transforming to what I call a "continued employment system." In 
terms of employment, Japanese companies have become less stable 
due to an increase in the employee turnover rate: instead of 
hiring only new graduates, as they did previously, Japanese 
companies have begun to take experienced hands into service. 
However, Japanese companies are still more steady than the Type 
A companies of the United States. 
  We are introducing favorable management methods from the 
United States, while keeping what is good in our management. 
  For instance, under the Japanese system of lifelong job 
rotation, personnel changes used to be made in an arbitrary 
manner. Today, many Japanese companies are asking their 
employees if they have a request, so that they can reflect their 
wishes as much as possible on the occasion of their job 
rotation. As for NEC, we have adopted a U.S. review system 
under which all employees will be appraised according to their 
achievements, and not according to the amount of hours they have 
spent on the job. 
<H5>  The Japanese Economy Suffers From Second-Stage Cancer </H5>
  If we compare the current economic situation to a cancer, we 
can say that there are already many symptoms showing that the 
cancerous growth has entered its second stage. I think the 
national economy got cancer toward the end of 1992. On 28 
August 1992, the previous government announced a package of 
economic-stimulus measures worth 10.7 trillion yen. It had to 
convene an extraordinary Diet session from the end of September 
through October to pass a supplementary budget so that the 
package would be implemented as soon as possible to maximize its 
pump-priming effect; otherwise "pure water," or real government 
spending, would have become smaller than the mentioned figure. 
Unfortunately, for several reasons, the convocation of the 
extraordinary Diet session was put off from day to day. It was 
around 10 December that the Diet finally passed a supplementary 
budget to finance the program. The impact of the long-awaited 
pump-priming package was weakened because of this delay. 
  At that time, I was already stressing the need for income 
tax 
cuts in addition to building up a counter argument against the 
tenacious view that the issue of deficit-financing bonds should 
be absolutely avoided. 
  Basically, the Government should not issue bonds to cover 
the 
budget deficit. This is a matter of common sense. For 
instance, if we do not have enough money to wine and dine, it is 
not good to borrow money for that. But taking another view, let 
us suppose that you get cancer. Your doctor tells you that it 
is still operable because it was detected in its early stages. 
But for that, you will have to pay one million yen. In such a 
case, you should try to recover your health, even by borrowing 
money from your friends or obtaining a loan from your company, 
because cancer can be cured if spotted early enough thanks to 
the power of contemporary medical science. If the surgical 
operation is delayed, your cancer will enter its second and 
third stages. The doctor's fee will run up even higher and you 
may still die in the end. No one will be able to bring you back 
to life. Toward the end of 1992, I was strongly calling for a 
quick remedy to recover the national economy, by comparing the 
current recession with cancer. 
  With respect to income tax cuts, I said "some 100,000 yen 
per 
household." I proposed an income tax reduction worth 3 or 4 
trillion yen. As a matter of course, income tax cuts of this 
scale are not sufficient to prop up a sluggish economy. I added 
that we should also make efforts to create a better atmosphere 
to induce people to spend money. For example, if consumers 
begin to feel that the employment situation will not become 
worse, that they will be able to return their housing loan 
somehow, and that the economy has now bottomed out, they will 
certainly spend 70,000 to 80,000 yen out of the 100,000 yen they 
receive from income tax cuts. However, if the surrounding 
atmosphere remains gloomy, after spending 10,000 or 20,000 yen, 
consumers would prefer to put the remaining money in a bank. 
  After all, economic performance is highly influenced by 
social psychology. In other words, it is a question of 
thinking. Therefore, I said that a reduction in income tax of 
100,000 yen per household would be effective if a package of 
other measures, such as a cut in interest rates, a revision of 
the capital gains tax, and the bolstering of the stock price of 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, is implemented at 
the same time. 
  Initially, the government predicted that the GNP would grow 
at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in fiscal 1992. In the middle 
of the year, it revised the figure to 1.6 percent. By the end 
of the fiscal year, it announced a 0.8 percent growth. Last 
year, Japan's economy shrank by 0.4 percent (later, the figure 
was revised to 0.6 percent) during the July-September period 
compared with the previous quarter. The government reported the 
drop in the GNP only at the beginning of December 1992. It 
means that it needed more than one month to make such an 
important announcement. 
  This is incredible, and no one has taken the blame. As 
for us, we must take the responsibility as company executives 
for even a small decline in profits. For instance, in the case 
of NEC, it was decided to cut the bonus of each executive by 25 
percent. If necessary, a further reduction will have to be 
implemented. 
  Company executives make sure to take the blame for what they 
have done, because they are entrusted by stockholders. 
  Frankly speaking, the government policies adopted until now 
were wrong. It is all right if the government believes that 
deficit-covering bonds are unnecessary. It is good if the 
government thinks there is no need for income tax cuts. The 
only point I would like to stress is that the government should 
take the responsibility for that. 
<H5>  Now Is the Very Moment To Carry Out Currency Reform </H5>
  When I attended a meeting of the Advisory Group for Economic 
Restructuring [a private advisory panel to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa] some time ago, I spoke with Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura about what the administration 
should be doing. I told him that the government should first 
set a target. I explained that administration is needed to help 
people reach a goal. I also added that administration becomes 
impossible where there is no target. For instance, the 
government should first say, "This year, the targeted economic 
growth rate is such and such." How can we work out an economic 
policy without fixing a target? 
  First of all, I want government officials to become more 
aware of the importance of setting a target. With regard to 
public investment, which has always been considered the 
centerpiece of an economic-stimulus package, I would like to ask 
government officials to come up with a well-balanced program. 
Here, the word "well-balanced" especially means that public 
works spending should concentrate mostly on projects that meet 
the needs of the times. 
  I am not against the idea of appropriating public works 
spending for the construction of bridges. Public works used to 
be the symbol of destruction and reproduction, workers are 
digging in and filling in the ground over and over again." I 
think we should try to improve this image of public works by 
introducing the idea of new social infrastructures that meet the 
needs of the times. 
  I have been stressing the importance of improving social 
infrastructures in consumer-oriented areas. The previous 
pump-priming package, which was worth 13.2 trillion yen and was 
adopted in April 1993, called for fiscal spending to expand and 
improve new social infrastructures. A supplementary budget 
passed the Diet on 10 June 1993, to finance stimulus measures. 
I hope that the idea of new social infrastructures will be 
reflected also in the budget for fiscal 1994. 
  For instance, improvement of administrative information 
systems based on computer networks should always be included in 
public works spending from now on. Until now, public works were 
concentrated mostly on projects to construct state-owned 
facilities or such infrastructures as bridges and roads. 
However, if the situation remains unchanged, we can no longer 
meet the needs of the times, as we are now living in an age of 
an information revolution. 
  In December 1991 when he was still a senator, Vice President 
Al Gore proposed a bill, which was enacted later by 
then-President George Bush as the "High-Performance Computing 
Act." Now, on 15 September 1993, the U.S. Government announced 
a project called the "National Information Infrastructure 
Program," which is to be promoted by a special task force headed 
by the secretary of commerce, and comprising officials of the 
Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Health and 
Human Services, and directors of such institutions as the 
Technology Standards Institute. Japan will not be able to keep 
pace with the times if the government does not seriously tackle 
the question of the growing importance of information from now 
on. The government should compile the budget for the next 
fiscal year keeping in mind the key point that we are living in 
the information age. In addition to income tax cuts and public 
spending emphasizing the improvement of new social 
infrastructures, we need one more measure, which would have a 
special impact on the economy. I propose that the government 
carry out currency reform. 
  Many people are strongly opposed to currency reform, saying 
the government should not implement such a costly measure while 
the national economy is still sluggish. On the contrary, I 
rather say the government must spend money, more aggressively to 
some extent, especially because of the recession. Although the 
national economy remains weak, it does not mean that Japan has 
no money at all. So why not spend it? In Japan, postal savings 
alone amount to 170 trillion yen in total. Moreover, it 
reportedly shows an annual increase of 10-odd trillion yen. If 
we add other personal savings as well as corporate savings, the 
total amount would reach 1 quadrillion yen. 
  There are calls for investment tax cuts. However, I do not 
think this measure is immediately necessary, because companies 
will not invest as long as there is no demand. They will start 
to invest only when there is every indication that individual 
consumption will pick up. Investment tax cuts will be helpful 
once there is an upward trend in demand. 
  Currency reform would help create new special demand. Some 
people even say that it would have an economic impact worth just 
under 5 trillion yen. As for the cost needed for currency 
redenomination, the implementation of tax cuts for the sake of 
policy would be one way to finance one part of the total cost. 
  Currency reform will help invigorate the stock market. 
Stock prices will more or less tend to go upward thanks to 
redenomination. This is not the only merit of currency reform. 
I hesitate a little bit to speak about the other advantage, 
because people might say, "Every miller draws water to his own 
mill." But anyway, I would like to point out that if people see 
a sector hit hard by the recession, like our software industry, 
regaining strength thanks to currency reform, it would have a 
big psychological impact. Employment destabilization is now a 
big problem. It the employment situation becomes more stable, 
consumers will decide to spend more money. Some people often 
say that consumers spend less money because there is nothing new 
to buy. However, I do not think so. In the past, for instance, 
there was a period of time when consumers used to have two or 
three cameras at home. Individual consumption is highly 
influenced by psychological factors derived from the economic 
trend. 
  One more advantage is that by improving the prestige of the 
yen, the currency reform might help halt the unjustified attempt 
by the United States to encourage a further appreciation of the 
yen against the dollar. I do not know why, but since around 
1987, Professor Lester C. Thurow has been reiterating that the 
value of the yen against the dollar should be 95 yen. 
  Let us suppose that the dollar drops to 95 yen. If the 
Japanese Government carries out currency reform, one dollar will 
be worth 0.95 new yen. Such a situation would probably be 
inadmissible for a proud country like the United States. I do 
not say that the appropriate value of the yen against the dollar 
is 100 yen. However, currency redenomination would prove 
significant, if it helps avoid at least a further appreciation 
of the yen above the 100-yen mark. 
  For the moment, I do not feel a strong will to invigorate 
the 
national economy on the part of the government. People 
attribute the current recession to the speculative bubble 
economy, to the sudden appreciation of the yen against the 
dollar, to cyclical fluctuations, etc. These opinions might be 
true. However, what is more important is to take the necessary 
actions. Unfortunately, it seems the government has no 
intention of making efforts to improve the current situation. 
  Politicians may be too occupied with political reform to 
think about the economy. However, that should not be the case 
for government officials who, unlike politicians, do not have to 
run in an election. I want government officials to show a 
strong will to help the economy recover, because it is time to 
compile the budget for the next fiscal year; otherwise, the 
national economy will never be revived. There is still a 
feeling that the economy will take a favorable turn by itself, 
even leaving the recession as it is, or that the economic 
climate will soon improve little by little since we have already 
suffered hardships for so long. Unfortunately, the current 
situation no longer allows the entertaining of such an 
optimistic view. 
  "The government should not issue deficit-covering bonds, 
which would weigh upon public finances until the days of our 
grandchildren." If there are people who continue to say this, at 
a time when we should concentrate on the urgent question of how 
to pull ourselves out of the current difficulty, I should say 
that they are really dreamers.

<F P=106> [Article by Yoichi Takahashi, Ministry of Finance] </F>
  [Excerpts] Nonperforming assets from the so-called bubble 
period are eroding our economy, particularly our financial 
institutions. Once faced with nonperforming assets due to the 
three L's (land, leveraged buyouts [LBO's] and less developed 
countries [LDC's]), the United States now has the situation 
almost completely under control, the result of strenuous 
restructuring efforts (personnel adjustments and the sale of 
unprofitable units) and aggressive efforts to dispose of problem 
loans. Without looking any further than our own backyards, we 
can easily see that nonperforming assets are now one of the 
biggest problems also facing our own financial institutions. 
  Those responsible for dealing with the problem at these 
institutions have been forced into a tough, lonely battle. First 
of all, problem loans are the "shame" of their institutions and 
are not something they can confer about with outsiders. It would 
be a different matter if their main banks took the lead and 
worked cooperatively with other financial institutions to settle 
the repayment of loans and other credit problems; but the harsh 
reality is that financial institutions without strong 
informational capabilities lose out to their stronger brethren 
in the competition to settle these loan problems. Also, the 
actual handling and write-off of nonperforming assets is 
essentially based on basic rulings or transmittals regarding 
corporate taxation. Both theory and legal precedent are poor in 
this area, and financial institutions do not have a clear 
understanding of the details for writing off nonperforming 
assets. 
  Second, those in charge of disposing of nonperforming assets 
are under pressure from the top management levels of their 
financial institutions, where there is a great deal of concern 
about the outcome of these assets. 
  Third, the Finance Ministry's banking inspectors have a hard 
time explaining matters concerning the write-off of 
nonperforming assets. It is harder to verify the lack of 
prospects for the repayment of a problem loan than it is to show 
that the chance of recovery exists. In order that the soundness 
of a financial institution's assets is maintained, the financial 
investigator not only verifies write-offs at the end of an 
accounting period, serving as a watchdog for depositors, but 
also assesses the company's assets during routine financial 
inspections. Still, although he may be told confidently by the 
loan officer in charge at the time that the institution's assets 
are being reviewed that a certain loan is not a problem and the 
company expects to be able to collect on it, when it comes time 
to document a write-off, the official in charge may tell him the 
loan is, in fact, uncollectible and that he wants to write it 
off. (Of course, there is no contradiction in what the financial 
institution's officers have said; the situation has changed 
between the time the two statements were made.) 
  The financial investigator who is in charge of verifying 
write-offs also has reason to feel impatient. Frequently, more 
than one financial institution will request a write-off for 
debts incurred by the same borrower. If the information from all 
of these sources were combined, everything one needs to know 
about the debtor in question would be available. But since the 
issue of confidentiality is concerned, that sort of information 
cannot be passed on from one financial institution to another. 
Consequently, because of shortcomings in their access to such 
information, some of their write-offs end up being taxable 
rather than nontaxable. 
  In this article, we would like, therefore, to explain 
certain 
underlying views concerning the write-off of nonperforming 
assets held by financial institutions and hopefully provide a 
useful reference for those who are routinely struggling with 
these matters. 
  Opinions expressed in this article are the responsibility of 
the author and do not necessarily reflect the official views of 
the Ministry of Finance. 
  I. What Does "Writing Off" a Bad Loan Mean? 
  [passage omitted] First of all, for the purposes of 
clarification, the term shokyaku in this article 
refers to the write-off of nonperforming assets such that, when 
a creditor is no longer able to expect repayment of a loan, it 
is either dropped from the balance sheet as an asset (direct 
write-off) or entered as a liability (and carried over to a 
special loan reserve account) (indirect write-off). 
  It goes without saying that a write-off constitutes a loss 
for a financial institution from a management perspective. 
Whether it constitutes a loss in terms of tax law, however, is a 
different matter. A write-off which constitutes a loss in terms 
of tax law is called a nontaxable write-off since it reduces a 
company's tax liability. Those that are not considered a loss 
are called taxable write-offs. 
  Shokyaku, which is used here in the sense of 
"writing off" a bad loan, has two homonyms whose uses probably 
have had something to do with its eventual relationship to 
taxes: one is shokyaku used in the sense of 
"burning," or extinguishing a bond (debt) and the other is 
shokyaku used in the sense of "erasing" a debt. 
  In other words, tax practices concerning the treatment of 
losses due to bad loans have been strict from the very start, 
and the only way that a direct write-off could be taken in the 
past was when the (problem) loan was removed, or "erased," as an 
asset. In 1954, however, given the frequent number of cases 
involving the nonpayment of notes and credit sales, indirect 
write-offs came to be recognized as long as a reserve account 
was set up to deal with such loans. No longer necessary to 
remove (problem) loans from one's list of assets, the amount of 
these nonperforming assets were then listed as liabilities and 
eventually came to be associated with shokyaku in the 
sense of "writing off" these nonperforming assets. 
  II. Methods of Handling Nonperforming Assets 
  1. The Present State of Nonperforming Assets 
  First of all, what are "nonperforming assets"? The term is 
ambiguous and its meaning differs from person to person. 
  The phenomenon, however, has garnered a great deal of 
attention, and there is a growing call, even among financial 
institutions, to have these so-called nonperforming assets 
disclosed. There are two types, which have a bearing on the 
soundness of the asset holdings of city banks, long-term credit 
banks, and trust banks, which are the targets of this call for 
disclosure: credit extended to borrowers involved in bankruptcy 
proceedings (i.e., credit involving borrowers who have begun 
liquidation or reorganization proceedings according to the 
provisions of the Commercial Code or reorganization proceedings 
according to the Corporation Reorganization Law) and credit 
extended to borrowers who are behind in their loan payments 
(i.e., credit where, when interest payments are in arrears 
beyond six months, the accrued interest is not calculated as 
revenue). These transfers are summarized in Table I.

  2. Importance of Disposing of Nonperforming Assets 
  In regard to the handling of nonperforming assets, it is 
written in the August 1992 publication, "Management Directions 
for Financial Administration 3: Disposal of Nonperforming 
Assets," "Delays in finding an early solution to the problem of 
nonperforming assets will create anxiety with regard to the 
financial system. Such delays will also become a major factor 
contributing to a slump in real estate transactions and, in 
turn, become an obstacle to economic recovery. From this 
perspective, the early establishment of guidelines for gradual, 
planned disposal of nonperforming assets is an urgent 
responsibility of government. Along with easing any doubts about 
our financial system, such steps are very important to ensuring 
its stability." 
  Why is it necessary to dispose of nonperforming assets? The 
answer is treated as a self-evident truth, and few sources seem 
to have taken up the subject of problem loans directly. We would 
like to take the opportunity to do so in this article and 
consider these problem loans from the perspective of disclosure 
and also their effect on corporate profits, particularly their 
effect on bank behavior. 
  Disclosure is the foundation of a free enterprise system 
based on a highly developed capitalist society, and it will 
become even more important as the demand grows for more market 
discipline (selection based on the market) among companies. 
  Balance sheets, the source of disclosures, are a way of 
clarifying a company's financial situation to outsiders, showing 
a balance between the company's total assets and its total 
liabilities and capital. In short, a company's assets on these 
balance sheets show how the company's liabilities and capital 
have been invested, while its liabilities and capital indicate 
the source and state of funding for its assets. For outsiders 
like shareholders, creditors and investors, the balance sheet is 
an essential source of information about a company's financial 
state of affairs. Needless to say, accuracy is the first rule of 
the day when it comes to balance sheets. 
  If, then, a company lists nonperforming assets--a loan, for 
example, to a borrower who has gone bankrupt--in the same way it 
would its healthy assets, neglecting to write it off properly on 
its balance sheet, this would constitute an unsound accounting 
procedure that actually presents a misleading picture of the 
company's real finances. Nor, without correctly evaluating its 
assets, does the company present a reasonable picture of its 
losses and earnings. In either case, when bad loans are not 
properly written off, disclosure is reduced to window-dressing 
accounting. 
  Disclosure requirements for nonperforming assets are 
important, in a legal sense, for a society that is governed by 
laws and regulations. Nonperforming assets, on the other hand, 
to the degree that they influence corporate revenues, have an 
important economic impact. 
  When companies are able to manage their losses by disposing 
of nonperforming assets by means such as (nontaxable) 
write-offs, they are able to lighten their corporate tax burden 
(and sometimes to reduce their dividends) and thus to limit the 
outflow and drain of profits from their companies. The result is 
an improved situation with regard to their assets. Secondary 
effects include a rise in the value of their stock and in their 
ratings as well as lower fund-raising costs, all of which 
encourage corporate growth. In the 1980's, U.S. financial 
institutions, from savings and loan companies to large ("money 
center") banks, fell on extremely hard times, some even failing, 
but as a result of restructuring their operations by cutting 
their work force and selling off unprofitable units while also 
disposing of their nonperforming assets, they are said to have 
recovered their earning power to a considerable extent. 
  Especially important in regard to financial institutions is 
the assurance that they be able to respond to lending demands. 
As noted in "Current Directions for Monetary Administration 2" 
(August 1992): "Because the drop in real estate and stock values 
which has accompanied the collapse of the so-called bubble 
economy may reduce the internal resources of financial 
institutions by lowering their latent profits and increasing 
their nonperforming assets, there is a danger that these 
institutions will be less able to respond to lending demands. To 
use the analogy of the human body, financial institutions are as 
important as blood is to the human system in terms of their role 
in facilitating smooth, sound economic activity. So there are no 
blockages in the financial system, if our economy is to develop 
in a sound, stable manner, we must try to safeguard the lending 
abilities of our financial institutions." As indicated in this 
statement, there is a potential risk that [nonperforming assets] 
can have the negative effect not only of disrupting the 
operations of individual financial institutions but, by lowering 
their lending ability, of disrupting the entire economy as well. 
  3. Comparison of Japanese and U.S. Write-Off Systems 
and Allowances for Bad Debts 
  In addition to the disposition of bad debts that have 
already 
been deemed uncollectible, anyone addressing the problem of 
nonperforming assets also has to deal with the subject of bad 
debt allowances to cover future losses due to such debts. Here, 
then, we would like to compare the systems in Japan and the 
United States for writing off such debts and the allowances in 
both countries for bad debts. 
  There are two kinds of allowances or reserves for bad debts. 
There is a general reserve, which is set up to cover the risk, 
inherent in all loans, that borrowers will default on their 
payments, and a special reserve set up as a hedge against the 
nonpayment of specified loan credits. 
  Japan has a fixed-rate reserve fund system, which is based 
on 
the Corporation Tax Law. (For banks, the ceiling rate is 0.03 
percent.) Such funds are considered nontaxable but, depending on 
the decision of the company, can be treated as taxable. In the 
United States, there is no fixed rate reserve system. Instead, 
funds may be accumulated at specific rates as determined by each 
company. As a rule, such funds are treated as taxable. 
  When there are no prospects for the repayment of a loan, an 
indirect write-off is possible if a special loan loss reserve 
account is set up as provided for in the Corporation Tax Law's 
basic rulings. Such accounts are treated as nontaxable. Indirect 
write-offs are also possible by setting up a special taxable 
account when the criteria set through such basic rulings are 
inappropriate to the situation of a company. Again, with regard 
to financial institutions, when there are no prospects for the 
repayment of a loan, the authorities concerned, who carry out 
the assessment of the institution's assets, will verify that the 
loan is a Category IV loan (debts determined to be 
uncollectible) and, when approved by the tax office, can be 
written off without being subject to taxation (write-off 
verification system). However, companies frequently choose 
taxable write-offs. 
  In the United States, on the other hand, if a loan does not 
seem to have any prospects for being repaid, it can be written 
off and is nontaxable. Frequently companies may set up a reserve 
account, however, that is not tax-deductible. Again, when loans 
considered losses (bad loans; comparable to our Category IV 
loans?) by the loan criteria of the auditing agent who assesses 
the institution's assets, financial institutions can deduct 100 
percent [of the expected amount of payments on those loans]; in 
the case of doubtful loans (i.e., repayment is questionable; 
comparable to our Category III loans?), 50 percent can be 
accumulated as a taxable bad debt allowance and at the stage 
where repayment is deemed impossible, it can be written off and 
be treated as nontaxable. However, loans which are considered 
losses, instead of being charged off to the loan loss reserve, 
may be written off, in which case they are treated as nontaxable. 
  Moreover, in regard to whether the amounts written off are 
nontaxable, not a few problems were said to have occurred 
between financial institutions and the tax authorities in the 
past. However, in February 1992, the Internal Revenue Service 
decided to treat amounts written off at the closing of accounts 
for noncollectible debts as nontaxable in the case of financial 
institutions following the criteria for loans and loan 
categories determined by the authorities concerned. Since the 
tax authorities can disallow the amount written off based on 
later tax audits, approvals based on this method are not final, 
but problems between financial institutions and the tax 
authorities seem to have been somewhat reduced. In this 
connection, there is a system of verifying write-offs in Japan 
for financial institutions that is carried out by the 
authorities concerned, as mentioned earlier, and in principle, 
approvals with regard to taxes are finalized by the time of the 
write-off, thus causing few problems between tax authorities and 
financial institutions. 
  As indicated above, it is difficult to make simple 
comparisons between Japan and the United States in terms of 
write-offs and allowances for bad debts. There is not a great 
deal of difference, however, with respect to our systems for 
special allowances for bad debts (as opposed to general 
allowances); nor, because of recent revisions on our part, are 
there significant differences at present in the circumstances 
for tax deductible and nondeductible write-offs when there are 
no prospects for a loan's being repaid. 
  4. Cooperative Credit Purchasing and Securitization 
  Another method of disposing of nonperforming assets, besides 
write-offs, which we are attempting to explain in this article, 
is that of selling off the problem loan itself. For this 
purpose, in January 1993, the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Co. 
was set up with financing from the various financial 
institutions. In selling nonperforming assets, the consent of 
the debtor is needed. As with direct write-offs, the loan itself 
is dropped from the balance sheet. Since it is then no longer 
subject to disclosure requirements, this method has recently 
come to be widely used. However, writing off problem loans has 
advantages not found in this method; for example, the debtor's 
consent is not required, nor does it matter what type of 
collateral was used to secure the loan. Both of these methods, 
therefore, complement each other and are effective ways to 
dispose of nonperforming assets. For example, the same debt, 
depending on the status of the collateral that was used, may in 
part be sold off during the settlement term and the remainder 
may be written off at the end of the term. 
  Again, another more evolved method is that of 
securitization. 
This method is very commonplace in the United States and has 
been used by foreign-based financial institutions in Japan to 
some degree but, in general, has otherwise rarely been used in 
this country. Unfortunately, skills in the area of 
securitization could have been better honed during the bubble 
period; nor was there sufficient penetration in our markets of 
securitized products. Still, there seem to be no basic, systemic 
restrictions in this area, and since it represents a business 
opportunity, we can probably expect the emergence in the future 
of competent, motivated "originators" (innovative creditors) in 
this area. 
  Leaving aside problems that may exist with regard to taxes, 
we see, for example, that many financial institutions and 
companies, after setting up special companies, are transferring 
their nonperforming assets to them. Rather than settling for 
this sort of backward-looking solution, such companies need to 
take a broader, more forward-looking perspective that includes 
the possibility of using these special companies to securitize 
these nonperforming assets. 
  Before getting into the practical details of the discussion, 
we would first like to give a brief outline of the nontaxable 
write-off system along with an overview of the way 
[nonperforming assets] are currently handled for financial 
institutions. Then, while considering the environment 
surrounding nonperforming assets, we would like to go into the 
main subject of this paper, which is non-taxable write-offs, 
particularly, indirect write-offs based on criteria defined by 
Basic Ruling 9.6.4 (one of the more important non-taxable 
write-offs, we feel), and also an explanation of taxable 
write-offs. Finally, in hopes of furthering the reader's 
understanding of these matters, we would like to go into some 
actual case studies involving nonbanks. 
  III. Outline of Nontaxable Write-Off System 
  Current provisions for nontaxable write-offs are found in 
National Tax Administration Agency Corporate Tax Law, Basic 
Rulings, Chapter 9, Section 6 ("Losses From Bad Debts") 
(hereafter referred to as "Basic Ruling"). An outline is 
provided as follows: 
  (a) Direct write-offs based on formal criteria (Basic Ruling 
9.6.1) 
  According to this ruling, when calculating their losses, 
creditors may write off a loan as a bad debt by waiving the debt 
or otherwise erasing it whether or not they report it as a loss 
on their balance sheets. 
  (b) Direct write-offs based on substantive criteria (Basic 
Ruling 9.6.2) 
  When it has become clear, because of the debtor's inability 
to pay, that a debt is uncollectible, it can be counted as a 
loss for tax purposes as long as the creditor accounts for it as 
a loss on his balance sheet for the period in which the loss 
occurs. In such a case, however, when collateral is involved, it 
must be disposed of before such a loss can be accounted for and 
recognized as a bad debt. 
  (c) Indirect write-off based on formal criteria (Basic 
Ruling 
9.6.5) 
  When a debtor becomes subject to the beginning of a 
reorganization procedure according to the Corporation 
Reorganization Law or has suspended bank draft transactions, up 
to 50 percent of the amount of the loan (excluding the amount 
secured by collateral) can be transferred to a special loan 
reserve account in the same accounting year that the above 
actions are taken against the debtor; approval will be given for 
including the transferred amount as a loss for tax purposes. 
However, in this case, a precondition is that the creditor 
report the loan as a loss on his balance sheet. 
  (d) Indirect write-off based on substantive criteria (Basic 
Ruling 9.6.4) 
  When a substantial portion of a loan is deemed irrecoverable 
due to the lack of prospects for a turnaround in the debtor's 
business or his inability over a substantial length of time to 
rid himself of his debts, the creditor may petition the head of 
the local tax office concerned (or where [one of the Finance 
Ministry's] corporate tax auditors is involved, the head of the 
National Tax Administration Agency) for his approval [before 
writing off] that portion of the loan which is deemed 
irrecoverable (excluding the amount secured by collateral) up 
until the last day of the business year in which the above set 
of facts have become pertinent to the creditor's claim; when 
that amount is transferred to a special loan reserve account, it 
will be recognized for the business year in question as a loss 
for tax purposes. 
  Here, too, the loss must be accounted for as such on the 
balance sheet. If, after the creditor submits his final return 
for the year in question and the head of the local tax office 
concerned has some dispute with the amount listed, the filer 
then has to submit a revised return as soon as possible. 
  Aside from the above, there are basic rulings that also have 
to do with the establishment of a special loan reserve account 
for loans that have been inactive for an extended period of time 
(9.6.6) and with increasing the amount in special loan reserve 
accounts when circumstances change (9.6.7). Also, the disposal 
of a bad loan is recognized if two years have lapsed since the 
accrued interest receivable on the loan has been listed as an 
asset (see National Tax Administration Publication 11, 
"Concerning the Treatment of Accrued Interest Receivables by 
Financial Institutions," 5 September 1966. 
  IV. Write-Off Verification System 
  Substantive matters regarding taxes and credits ought to be 
decided objectively and without any ambiguity in meaning. In 
fact, however, legal regulations are not often written so 
clearly as not to leave room for questions of interpretation; 
subjectivity also plays a role in determining the facts as they 
relate to taxes. Taxes would be robbed of their fairness, 
however, if such interpretations and decisions were left up to 
the individual taxpayer to make, and in the end, there is no 
other alternative but to rely on the tax authorities to come up 
with uniform interpretations and decisions. 
  In principle, the tax filing system is based on the 
taxpayer's self-assessment of his tax liability. When that 
assessment differs from that of the tax office, the tax office's 
decision is the one that must be followed (though, of course, 
the taxpayer can file an administrative complaint against the 
tax office's disposition of his case and can even fight the 
validity of the decision in court). 
  The same can be said about writing off loans. The specific 
amount to be written off is tentatively decided at the end of 
the business year but the final determination of the amount has 
to await the decision of the tax authorities following their tax 
audit. 
  However, in the case of write-offs of nonperforming assets 
by 
financial institutions, an agreement between the Ministry of 
Finance and the National Tax Administration Agency has made it 
possible since 1950 for the amount of assets verified by the 
bank inspector as "uncollectible or worthless" to be recognized, 
in principle, as losses for tax purposes without having to be 
approved by the tax authorities. This arrangement, known as the 
nonperforming asset write-off verification system, recognizes 
the write-off of loans and other assets as nontaxable losses if 
the write-off is verified by the bank inspector. This 
arrangement applies to all but a segment of our financial 
institutions (the exceptions are noted later). Such write-offs 
can not be discounted by the tax authorities. 
  The reasons that such a system was set up only for financial 
institutions probably lie in the special nature of these 
institutions, which sets them apart from general businesses, and 
the view that it would be more effective to leave the 
verification of nonperforming loan write-offs to the bank 
inspectors, who are routinely involved in the audit of financial 
institutions and have a thorough knowledge of their special 
character. 
  The disposal of bad loans, as far as taxes are concerned, is 
dealt with, as in the above examples, through basic rulings of 
the National Tax Administration Agency. The main points, in 
terms of carrying these rulings out, are defined in transmittals 
by the chief of the Banking Inspection Department [of the 
Ministry of Finance]; that is, in "Outline for Implementing the 
Verification System for Nonperforming Assets" (hereafter, 
"Implementing Verification System") and "Outline for Handling 
Verifications Concerning Special Loan Reserve Accounts" 
(hereafter, "Outline for Reserve Accounts"). According to these 
sources, the nature of the bank inspector's verifications are as 
follows: 
  (1) When a creditor waives an obligation (Basic Ruling 
9.6.1(4)), the bank inspector verifies the appropriateness of 
disposing of the bad debt. 
  (2) In the case of a direct write-off based on substantive 
criteria (Basic Ruling 9.6.2), he verifies the amount of the 
loss due to the bad debt. 
  (3) In the case of an indirect write-off based on 
substantive 
criteria (Basic Ruling 9.6.4), he verifies the amount 
transferred to the special loan reserve account. 
  (4) In the case of an indirect write-off based on formal 
criteria (Basic Ruling 9.6.5), he verifies the amount deducted 
from the debt. 
  (5) In the case of the indirect write-off of a loan that has 
been inactive for an extended period of time (Basic Ruling 
9.6.6), he verifies the amount that has been secured by such 
means as a mortgage or right of pledge. 
  (6) When a special loan reserve account is added to because 
of a change of circumstance (Basic Ruling 9.6.7), he verifies 
the (additional) amount that has been transferred to the account. 
  In cases (4) and (5) above, even when no amount has been 
secured by means of a mortgage or right of pledge or there is no 
amount to be deducted from the amount of the loan, that fact, 
too, must be verified. Again, in cases of a direct write-off 
based on formal standards, with the exception of cases where a 
debt has been waived by the creditor (Basic Ruling 9.6.1(1) 
through (3)), it is not necessary to verify the write-off. 
  In principle, a loan write-off that has been verified by the 
bank inspector in the manner discussed above is recognized as a 
loss for tax purposes; however, if some question should arise 
regarding its write-off as a loss during the verification 
process, tax authorities will be contacted to discuss whether a 
write-off will be appropriate or not. When tax authorities find 
a write-off inappropriate after the loan has been verified, the 
matter is settled through a discussion between the tax 
authorities concerned and the bank inspector who verified the 
loan. In fact, however, tax authorities rarely question a loan 
that has already been verified.

  [Text] The Actual Situation of Japanese Enterprises 
Shaken by a Tug of War Between Employment and Profitmed 
  In 1992 Hitachi Ltd. shifted production of video tape 
recorders for export (about 400,000) to its Malaysian plant. 
  This, naturally, left surplus workers in Japan. Hitachi has 
transferred 750 workers from its Tokai plant (Ibaragi 
Prefecture) and its Haramachi plant (Fukushima Prefecture) to 
heavy electric machinery plants and other affiliates, and has 
cut its workforce by 1,000, including 250 by natural wastage. 
Hitachi plans to cut the remaining 3,000-strong workforce to 
2,000. 
  However, transferring staff is not easy. Heavy electric 
machinery plants have no surplus power to accept extra workers, 
and in each sector Hitachi has reached the limit of its ability 
to juggle its workers between the various sectors concerned. 
  Moreover, even though it has cut 1,000 workers as planned, 
it 
is still overmanned. This month the Tokai Plant will enforce a 
compulsory temporary leave of two days. Despite plans by 
Hitachi to start producing personal fax machines and portable 
telephones, the prospects are not bright. 
  And the strong yen is not helping. There are various kinds 
of goods which are not economical to produce even at the level 
of 110 yen to the dollar. A further shifting of the production 
base overseas will be necessary in the future. 
  Meanwhile, heavy electric machinery plants and other 
affiliates can no longer afford to absorb surplus workers. 
Hitachi is suffering from this dilemma. 
  Furthermore, overseas production forces consideration of 
measures to prevent deindustrialization within Japan as well as 
the problem of finding new places for overseas production. The 
greatest problem of all is the local procurement of parts, to 
say nothing of the problem of infrastructure and the education 
of workers. 
  Shuzo Kawashima, director in charge of the promotion of 
overseas production at Fujitsu Ltd., said: "Overseas production 
does not pay unless the local procurement rate of parts reaches 
more than 50 percent." 
  The local procurement rate for Hitachi's Malaysian plant has 
reached 70 percent, but the cylinders (rotating heads), which 
are the principal parts of video tape records, are imported from 
Japan. 
  Managing Director Yoshiki Yagi said: "We are having a very 
hard time in Malaysia because the parts makers there want to 
raise prices. They are desperate because of the appreciation of 
the yen. Both the sellers and buyers of parts are cutting each 
other up with swords clashing. Shifting the production base 
overseas does not necessarily lead to an immediate reduction in 
costs." 
<H5>  There is Nothing To Make in Japan Any More </H5>
  In the case of automobiles, which need about 30,000 parts, 
moving the production base overseas becomes even more difficult. 
Since the just-in-time system has taken root and replaced parts 
inventories, a shortage of even one part can stop the production 
lines. 
  It means, therefore, that the transfer of plants is 
accompanied by a great shift involving parts makers. In order 
to establish a single production line, an investment of tens of 
billions of yen is necessary. 
  In addition, the overseas transfer of the automobile 
industry, which very effectively absorbs employment, immediately 
leads to the problem of unemployment. Auto industry executives 
share the common feeling that "it is unwise for the automobile 
industry to trigger employment insecurity." 
  However, the realities are harsh. President Yuichi 
Nakamura of Mitsubishi Motors Corporation says: "Appreciation 
against the dollar by just one yen wipes out a profit of 50 
billion yen among the 11 automakers in Japan. We have already 
suffered a loss of one trillion yen since the beginning of this 
year due to the appreciation amounting to 20 yen." 
  At least 110 yen to the dollar is needed to make the export 
of automobiles profitable. Dropping below the break-even point, 
it becomes difficult to continue production in Japan, but moving 
production overseas is not easy either. 
  Japanese enterprises cannot follow the speed of the yen's 
appreciation, and every attempt they make has been forestalled. 
This is the dilemma Japanese enterprises are in when it comes to 
moving their production overseas. 
  There is a divergence of seven yen between the current 
exchange rate and the break-even rate, the details of which will 
be stated later. In order to make up the difference, an 
immediate cut in costs must be made through the procurement of 
parts abroad or moving production overseas. 
  Managing Director Hiroshni Kuwabara of Hitachi, Ltd. said 
positively: "So long as exporting enterprises procure or 
produce parts in Japan, they can cope with the appreciation of 
the yen only to the level of 120 yen to the dollar. If the 
exchange rate rises to 100 yen to the dollar, no amount of 
automation can compensate." 
  According to a questionnaire conducted by the Economic 
Planning Agency in January 1993 among 620 companies "on the 
behavior of enterprises," the break-even rate for Japan's 
manufacturing industries is 124 yen to the dollar. 
  Because of the sharp rise in the value of the yen, 
therefore, 
enterprises have been making frantic efforts through such 
measures as adding the appreciation of the yen to prices, risk 
hedging through forward exchange contracts, and rationalization. 
  As a result, the general view is that the current break-even 
rate is about 115 yen to the dollar. Surveys conducted by the 
Kogyo Bank Ltd. and the Asahi Bank Ltd. [as published] show 
almost the same result. 
  However, the actual exchange rate has already dropped below 
the 110 yen level; the current rate is about 108 yen. There is 
a difference of as much as seven yen, therefore, between the 
current exchange rate and the break-even rate. 
  In the case of Toshiba, for example, if the currency rises 
in 
value against the dollar by just one yen it causes a loss of 4 
billion yen. A rise of seven yen results in a loss of 28 
billion yen. In short, a little over half of the expected 
recurring profit for 1993 has been lost. 
  An executive of Alps Electric Co., Ltd., a medium-sized 
maker 
of audio-visual related parts, ventured: "Our company may no 
longer be able to produce in Japan parts which have a 
competitive edge." The situation is such that shifting the base 
of production overseas has become a matter of great urgency. 
<H5>  "An Experiment" Begun by Toshiba in Dairen, China </H5>
  In July this year, Toshiba's Dairen plant began operations 
in 
Dairen, China. The plant has adopted some unique practices. 
  Its production items, themselves, are a matter of interest. 
They are small motors, printing units for televisions, 
deflection corks for picture tubes, delay lines and others, 
which are, at a glance, an odd combination. 
  That is not surprising, for the four items have been 
transferred from separate plants. Production at each plant was 
worth about several billion yen. However, profit margins began 
declining and the scale of each plant's production was such that 
it was too small to be shifted overseas. 
  The answer, for the production technology promotion 
department of Toshiba's general staff, was the establishment of 
Toshiba's Dairen plant. Toshiba adopted a system under which 
applications for production at the production line of the Dairen 
plant are accepted from each of its business departments. 
  Viewed as a whole, the idea in Toshiba is that if 
unprofitable items held by each business department are put 
together, that will produce enough profit to finance the capital 
investment necessary for shifting the base of production 
overseas. 
  However, under the vertical system of organization, it does 
not pay to shift production of a small quantity of goods 
overseas. When that happens, measures against the appreciation 
of the yen are delayed, worsening the profitability of business. 
Director Tetsuya Yamamoto explains: "The Dairen plant is an 
experiment to speed up measures to protect ourselves against the 
appreciation of the yen." 
  The plant site is nearly 120,000 square meters. There is 
enough space for two more buildings, and the Dairen plant is 
ready to accept applications for future use of the production 
line from each business department. The current work force of 
6,000 local employees is expected to increase further. 
  Meanwhile, for the past few years, Ricoh Co., Ltd. has been 
making an effort to develop digital copying machines (used not 
only as copying machines and faxes, but also as printers for 
personal computers) and color copying machines. Demand for 
these items has grown. 
  At present 6,000 digital copying machines and 600 color 
copying machines are produced monthly. The number of color 
copying machines sold has reached about 20 percent of the sales 
figure for digital copying machines. 
  In particular, demand for color copying machines has been 
greater than expected, and the Atsugi plant has had such a rush 
of demands it has increased production of the machines. 
Employees will have to work even on Sundays in December. 
  Managing Director Haruo Kamiki of Ricoh Co., Ltd. says: 
"Over the next year production of digital and color copying 
machines will be further increased. Production of low speed, 
analog machines will be shifted to Shenzhen, China, and in 
proportion to that, the domestic production of digital and color 
copying machines will be increased. We are not worried about 
the deindustrialization of Ricoh itself." 
  The development of original technology, which can keep 
itself 
out of a price competition, and the shifting of production to 
high value-added products based on that technology holds the key 
to avoiding deindustrialization. 
<H5>  Aiwa Has Fully Pursued Shift To Overseas Production </H5>
  If a production shift to high value-added products is 
impossible, there is no other choice but to thoroughly shift the 
base of production to overseas. 
  Aiwa is typical in that, despite the prolonged sluggish 
demand for audio-visuals and the strengthening of the yen, it 
has earned a recurring profit of 2.3 billion yen (the interim 
settlement for September 1993), twice the amount earned over the 
same period last year. 
  Aiwa's overseas production volume is expected to reach 75 
percent by March next year. This shows how advanced Aiwa has 
been in shifting its production base overseas, compared with 
Sony Corporation whose overseas production volume is 35 percent. 
  At Aiwa's main plants in Malaysia, Singapore and elsewhere, 
local procurement rates have reached more than 70 percent. 
  Aiwa has established a research and development center in 
Singapore and has employed local designers. It has established 
a consistent system -- local designing, local procurement, and 
local production. It has been thorough in its approach. 
  What prompted Aiwa's decision to shift production overseas 
was the previous recession caused by the strong yen. Aiwa 
suffered a business loss of 4.27 billion yen in December 1986 
and became a nondividend-paying company for the first time in 14 
years. It continued not to pay dividends until 1989. 
  Aiwa, therefore, invited applications for voluntary 
retirement from 1,000 employees. Its 3,000 employees were 
reduced to 2,000, and its domestic plants were closed. The 
shifting of the production base overseas is always accompanied 
by such a sacrifice and pain. 
  An executive of a certain precision machine maker spoke 
about 
the difficulty of making the decision to move production 
overseas. 
  He said: "No manager thinks the current strong yen reflects 
the real strength of the economy. They think to themselves that 
a change in the political situation will immediately bring about 
a depreciation of the yen. They do not have the nerve, 
therefore, to shift their production overseas because it means 
dealing with the problem of employment." 
  The Japanese enterprises are at a standstill, caught in a 
dilemma as to whether to shift their production overseas or not. 
How long will the tug-of-war between "employment" and "profit" 
last? Can they find a way out of the difficulty? The crucial 
moment has yet to come. 
<H3>  Small and Medium Subcontractors Perplexed and Troubled by 
the Shift to Overseas Production </H3>
  "We want you to reduce the unit price of parts by 4-5 
percent." 
  Honda Motor Co., Ltd. conducts price negotiations with 
subcontracting parts makers twice a year. At the beginning of 
September this year, negotiations were conducted for the 
purchase of parts for the latter half of the year. At the 
negotiation table, the Honda side asked for a price cut of 4-5 
percent. 
  The parts makers who were sounded out on the matter 
immediately realized the seriousness of the situation. They had 
been expecting a request for a 1.5 percent price cut had it not 
been for the appreciation of the yen since the spring. They 
suffered a further blow. They was a hint that a request for a 
similar cut would be made at the next round unless the current 
economic environment changed. 
  Such developments are not confined to the automobile 
industry. A maker of office automation products says: "From 
now on, we are going to ask Japanese parts makers to lower the 
cost of their parts to the cost of parts made in Southeast Asian 
countries." As can be seen, the requests from parts buyers are 
becoming tougher and tougher. Unit prices have been lowered and 
sales volume has been cut. Sub-contractors and parts makers are 
being hit from both sides. 
  Research Section Chief Takenori Takagi of the Shoko Chukin 
Bank says: "To small and medium enterprises, the ratio of 
break-even point to sales is about 92 percent on average. A cut 
of just several percentage points in sales is a great blow. The 
small and medium enterprises are in a very serious situation." 
<H5>  Parts Buyers Clamor for Price Cuts </H5>
  An overseas director of a electronic materials maker said 
resignedly: "Although the exchange rate has moved by only 15 
percent, sales prices have dropped by 20 percent. Furthermore, 
the clients are asking for further price reductions. We have 
really reached the limit of our resources." 
  An electronic parts maker for household electric appliances 
said: "I think that the parts buyers now look for low-priced 
parts to the exclusion of quality. It seems that they intend to 
patiently train local makers. But what are we going to do, 
Japanese makers who have staked our lives and fortunes on the 
quality of our parts?" 
  The fortunes of Japanese parts makers will dwindle to 
nothing 
if they do not act. Small and medium subcontractors will face 
the decision of whether to stay within Japan or shift their 
production base overseas. 
  Managing Director Haruo Kamimoto of Ricoh said: "When the 
decision to shift production overseas is made, some parts 
suppliers come forward, saying, `We will go with you.' When we 
shifted production to Britain, four to five parts makers asked 
to come with us; when we shifted production to Shenzhen, China, 
about 10 makers applied to us." 
  For example, several big businesses, such as Ricoh, 
Toshiba, Sharp and Seiko Epson have shifted production to 
Shenzhen, China. They seem to welcome the fact that Japanese 
subcontractors which supply high quality parts want to follow 
them to China. 
  However, one of the subcontractors, a chemical materials 
maker said: " Household electrical appliance makers and office 
automation product makers can easily shift production overseas, 
but it is not so easy for the equipment industry like ours to 
make the move. We are unable to make any overseas investment 
now." 
  An electronic parts maker said: "If a big firm moves 
production abroad, we, a smaller business, would like to follow 
it, but we are uncertain whether we can produce parts overseas 
which are comparable in quality to those made in Japan. If we 
produce inferior goods, our trustworthiness will be questioned 
and our transactions within Japan will be canceled." 
  Other smaller businesses also hesitate to shift their 
production base overseas. We can see another dilemma here. 
<H5>  Local Plants Often Attract Unexpected Problems </H5>
  Even when Japanese enterprises have successfully shifted 
production overseas, they encounter unexpected troubles. 
  In the case of one rubber goods maker, local workers falsely 
reported the number of inferior goods found in a day. According 
to the report, there were five pieces of inferior goods in every 
1,000 produced. Actually, the figure was closer to 100, and 
furthermore, it was found they had been discarded in a rubbish 
bin. It is said that unless Japanese resident representatives 
keep a sharp watch on local workers, there is no knowing what 
may happen. 
  A chemical materials plant which shifted production to 
Indonesia suffered a big operating loss for similar reasons. It 
seems "the idea of the yield rate is not acceptable to local 
workers." 
  At the start of production, local workers used the wrong 
kind 
of raw material or mixed the material incorrectly. This mistake 
has happened since, causing the loss of a whole day's production 
on one occasion. This is a tragedy caused by the absence of 
know-how among local producers. 
<H3>  Japan's Subcontracting Structure Shaken by the Shift to 
Overseas Production </H3>
  Alps Electric Co., Ltd., an audiovisual goods part maker 
which had enthusiastically promoted shifting production 
overseas, decided, in January, to take in only half of the 
orders placed with its subcontractors, because its production 
volume had dropped. It is estimated that as a result, the 
20,000 workers at the subcontractors' factories will be reduced 
by half. 
  Furthermore, in August this year Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd. 
discontinued the consignment production of CD (compact disc) 
radio-cassettes entrusted to Sanritsu Electric Co., Ltd., an 
affiliate in which Sanyo had invested 20 percent. Since the 
greater part of Sanritsu's sales come from Sanyo, the closure of 
Sanritsu is inevitable. 
  A Sanyo spokesman said peevishly: "The closure of the 
Sanritsu plant is due to internal strife. We did not 
discontinue the consignment production arbitrarily." 
  However, you can be certain that "the staged reduction of 
consignment production" through the shift in production of CD 
radio-cassettes to Singapore or Malaysia was the direct and 
indirect cause of the closure of Sanritsu. 
  As industries develop more and more, it is inevitable that 
mature industries will shift their production overseas. This is 
the economic mechanism. Naturally, subcontractors and parts 
makers which lack competitiveness will be forced to restructure. 
More and more small and medium firms will be forced to move to 
areas where wages are cheaper. 
  Research Director Teruyasu Murakami of Nomura Research 
Institute said: "As far as Greater China (China, Hong Kong and 
Taiwan) is concerned, we may think that a mechanism is almost 
complete by which it will absorb every industry." The situation 
is such that some things have become inevitable. 
  The chairman of an electronic equipment maker (whose stocks 
are partially listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange) which, since 
last year, has begun shifting its operation to China said: "In 
truth, we are thinking of reducing the number of outside orders 
to about two thirds. We do not want to part with highly 
motivated enterprises or enterprises with technical know-how. 
But we want to leave behind companies which lack initiative." 
  As we have seen in the cases of Alps Electric Co., Ltd. and 
Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd., smaller businesses and subcontractors 
with a weak management foundation will be hit hard, and their 
numbers are sure to grow. 
  The ominous increase in bankruptcies among small and medium 
firms may be the prelude to that.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, December 30 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- As the 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs, the State Great Hural (SGH) 
session approved the law on international treaties of Mongolia. 
The law is to regulate relations connected with the signing and 
realization of bilateral and multilateral treaties and 
agreements, with the joining and leaving international pacts and 
agreements. 
  It is informed that the SGH session was to start discussing 
the draft law on land. But it was decided to postpone this 
discussion for a detailed consideration of the draft law by the 
parliament party groups. The newspaper informs that the session 
set to consideration of the draft law on making amendments and 
additions in the criminal code in the first reading. Additions 
and amendments will be made in the criminal code in connection 
with adoption of the new constitution, the criminal code, laws 
on court and procurator's organs. The newspaper notes that in 
the draft law special attention is paid to the guarantee of 
human rights and freedoms. 
  The head of the letters sector of the State Great Hural 
Chancellery C. Davuu informs in the newspaper that in the 
current year the parliament has received about 720 letters of 
citizens. Besides that, the parliament members have met 
personally with more than 780 citizens. C. Davuu notes that, as 
the parliament members are always busy with legislative 
activity, they have time to meet with citizens mainly during the 
parliament recess. The majority of letters is given to the 
corresponding standing committees. As C. Davuu notes, the 
majority of the letters concerns the laws adopted by the 
parliament, the population's living standards guarantee. 
  The newspaper publishes conclusions of the competent persons 
related to burying of the soil contaminated by isotope 
"Strontium 90", which was revealed in the Mongolian capital. 
The executive secretary of the government commission on nuclear 
energy T. Damdinsuren announces that the contaminated soil is 
buried in location Aldar-Tolgoi the only place in the country 
for the present meant for burying radio-active substances. T. 
Damdinsuren notes that the repeated dosemetrical measuring shows 
that radio-activity remains at the natural level. 
  Doctor of Economic Science, Professor G. Purebbaatar writes 
in the newspaper that he considers the government conclusion 
about a tendency for improvement of economic situation in the 
country as groundless. As he says, such a conclusion under 
conditions of production drop, unemployment growth, continued 
inflation and the living standards drop can be considered as 
selfdeception. 
  G. Purebbaatar points out to the importance of support for 
producers, the carrying out of a flexible creditcurrency policy. 
  The newspaper of the Mongolian Social Democratic Party 
(MSDP) 
"UG" publishes an address of the MSDP Political Council to 
members and supporters of the party and the Mongolian people. 
This address is devoted to the 4th anniversary of foundation of 
the Mongolian Social Democratic Party in foundation of this 
party coincides with the beginning of democratization of the 
society, that the social democratic movement has played a big 
role in realization of democratic reforms in the country. 
  The MSDP Political Council and the editorial staff of the 
newspaper "UG" are wishing the readers a happy New Year. 
  As the newspaper informs, the Social Democratic Party has 
organized a theoretical-practical conference on the theme "W. 
Brandt and Global Policy". The conference was devoted to the 
80th birthday of the well-known figure of the social democratic 
movement, ex-chancellor of the FRG. 
  The State Great Hural Deputy Chairman J. Gombojab, the SGH 
members D. Lundeejantsan and R. Gonchigdorj, the representatives 
of different political parties have participated in work of the 
conference. 
  The newspaper carries the statement by the oppositional 
forces to the constitutional court of the country. In the 
statement it is pointed out to the lack of correspondence of the 
recently adopted law on relations of the state with church with 
the Constitution. In particular, the oppositional forces 
consider a prefence given in the new law to Buddhist and Islam 
religions as violation of the Constitution. It is noted that by 
the demand of the oppositional forces the joint order of the 
president of Mongolbank and the minister of finance about 
regulation of currency circulation and strengthening of 
discipline of payments and calculations was cancelled. The 
opposition considered that the order infringes upon private 
owners' rights. 
  The newspaper publishes an extract from the book by the 
leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia V. Zhirinovskiy 
"The Last Rush to the South". The newspaper adduces the 
statement by the chairman of the Russian Communist Party A. 
Zuganov: "We do not consider the Liberal-Democratic Party headed 
by V. Zhirinovskiy as a fascist one".

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, December 31 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
central Mongolian press widely publish the materials devoted to 
the results of the going 1993 year including information 
concerning the year's awards by miscellaneous public and 
creative organizations. 
  The newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that president of the 
country P. Ochirbat has got acquainted with the suggestions and 
proposals relating to an economic distribution of Mongolia 
worked out by the National Development Department in cooperation 
with other competent organs. The president noted that the 
economical distribution of the country is of great importance 
for the implementation of structural policies on the territorial 
level, the real attitude of aymags and other local units towards 
market relations, renovation of the territorial administration 
system. According to him, the proposals for economic 
distribution are expedient to be considered by the council for 
national security prior to submitting them for consideration to 
the Great State Hural of Mongolia. 
  The newspaper publishes the interview of its correspondent 
with Minister of Demographical Policies and Labour E. Gombojab 
which was devoted to the approval of regular measures on 
ensuring social guarantees of living standards for the 
population. 
  E. Gombojab noted that the above mentioned measures are 
being 
taken in connection with the growth of prices in order to 
guarantee proper minimum subsidence level for citizens 
especially the vulnerable ones. 
  The measures intended for by the government would be 
realized 
beginning since 1994. It is planned to increase considerably 
salaries especially for those engaged in intellectual [word 
indistinct] and to increase tensions and allowances as [word 
indistinct]. 
  The newspaper commenting on the activity of the Great State 
Hural over the year of 1993, noted that it was fruitful 
especially in relation to the laying down legal basis for state 
organs functioning in accordance with the Constitution. 
  The Mongolian parliament has paid much attention to the 
problems of transition of the country to a market economy [words 
indistinct]. It is noted that there is a considerable rise in 
the number of herdsmen owning over a thousand head of cattle. 
  The newspaper "ERH CHOLOO" issued by the Mongolian National 
Democratic Party [MNDP] underlined a creation by the government 
the working group for study and implementation of proposals put 
forward by the MNDP on approving pressed measures for 
restoration and development of domestic production. The MNDP in 
its statement stressed that the wrong creditory custom and tax 
policies of the government is hindering efficient development of 
production in the country. 
  The newspaper publishes an article by chairman of the city 
committee of the MNDP T. Enhtubshin who underscored the 
necessity for steady carrying on policies for increasing 
treasure. It is connected as the author noted, with the fact 
that over the last 70 years because of the domination of one 
party there has been squandered the property of the country. 
The author considers that society and economy are possible to 
develop only on the foundation of private interests of people 
which is in conformity with human tendencies.

  [Text] Seoul, Dec. 31 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
United States resolved Wednesday nearly all of their differences 
on inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities and a 
third-round of high-level talks in their working-level contact 
in New York, a senior South Korean Government official said 
Friday. As a result, North Korea will resume its negotiations 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and 
working-level contact with South Korea in January, the official 
said. There is also a strong possibility that North Korea and 
the United States will hold a third round of their high-level 
talks soon, he said, requesting anonymity. 
  "The United States and North Korea could not reach a 
complete 
agreement as two problems arose at their contact in New York on 
Tuesday," the official said. "But these problems are not crucial 
and I don't believe that they will become an obstacle." 
  The official declined to disclose details of the 
difficulties 
but said the United States and South Korea have already informed 
Pyongyang of their positions on the problems. 
  "Therefore, the statement by the North Korean Foreign 
Ministry spokesman on Thursday night could be taken as its 
reply, accepting the U.S.-South Korean position," the official 
said. 
  The statement said that there had been a breakthrough in the 
latest round of talks between the United States and North Korea 
in New York. 
  "The two sides removed a series of stumbling blocks that had 
deadlocked the North Korea-U.S. talks and made a breakthrough 
for progress...," the North Korean spokesman said. 
  The South Korean official said, "The possibility of solving 
the two problems is increasing." 
  He indicated that North Korea is going to allow the IAEA to 
inspect all seven of its nuclear facilities in Yongbyon and will 
accept a proposal for exchanges of special envoys with South 
Korea. 
  The problems involve the venue for the North Korean-IAEA 
talks. North Korea wants to hold them in Pyongyang whereas the 
United States want them to be held in a third country and favors 
Vienna, according to informed sources. Because of these 
differences, the two sides could not work out a complete 
agreement, they said. 
  The United States and North Korea are expected to hold 
another working-level contact in New York early next month to 
discuss the venue for the talks and other auxiliary matters. 
  Inter-Korean relations and the North Korean nuclear issue 
will enter into a new phase if the United States and North Korea 
agree to hold a third-round of high-level talks, they said.

  [Text] It has been learned that if the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] and North Korea reach an agreement in 
nuclear inspection negotiations, the government will announce 
its plan to suspend this year's Team Spirit exercise. 
  A government official pointed out that the reason the ROK 
Government will announce the suspension of the Team Spirit 
exercise is to make North Korea aware of the fact that its 
efforts to exclude the ROK Government's role in the negotiations 
to resolve North Korea's nuclear issue is a very unrealistic 
measure. 
  This official said that even after the suspension of the 
Team 
Spirit exercise is announced, if the result of the IAEA's 
inspection is not satisfactory and the exchange of special 
envoys of the South and North is not realized, the ROK 
Government will decide to resume the Team Spirit exercise and 
will make the announcement. 
  This official added that the reason it was decided that the 
ROK Government will announce the suspension of the Team Spirit 
exercise and its resumption, if the result of the IAEA's 
inspection is not satisfactory and the exchange of special 
envoys of the South and North is not realized, is to show that 
the ROK Government is playing a clear role in the process of 
nuclear negotiations between the United States and North Korea, 
and to point out that it is very unrealistic for North Korea to 
insist only on direct negotiations between the United States and 
North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- This year will see a 
turning point in inter-Korean relations as South Korea and the 
United States have almost agreed with North Korea on how to 
solve the nuclear problem, according to a government official. 
  "The United States and North Korea virtually agreed at a 
series of contacts in New York last month to simultaneously 
resolve the issues of the third round of North Korea-U.S. 
high-level talks, North Korea's acceptance of full-fledged 
nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) and exchange of special envoys between South and North 
Korea," the senior official said Monday. "So we expect a great 
change in inter-Korean relations this year." 
  He said that Washington and Pyongyang will have another 
working-level contact to reach final agreement and he expects 
direct consultation between the IAEA and North Korea to resume 
soon. 
  An IAEA inspection team could enter North Korea as soon as 
Jan. 10, he said. On the day the team enters North Korea, Seoul 
will announce suspension of its "Team Spirit" joint military 
exercise with the United States, and Washington will announce 
the holding of a third-round of high-level talks with Pyongyang, 
he added. The two Koreas are expected to have a working-level 
contact for exchange of special envoys. 
  "Pyongyang and Washington are expected to have the third 
round of their high-level talks as early as around the end of 
this month to find a thorough and broad solution of the North 
Korean nuclear problem and discuss improvement of 
Pyongyang-Washington relations," he said. 
  Former opposition leader Kim Tae-chung, who is engaged in 
the 
study of unification, said on New Year's day that he expects 
great progress and even an inter-Korean summit this year if the 
nuclear problem is solved. 
  The government should lay emphasis on solving the nuclear 
problem and then on resumption and revitalization of 
inter-Korean economic cooperation, Kim said. 
  At the end of last year, President Kim Yong-sam told 
journalists that he saw signs of change beginning to show and 
there would be an important turning point in inter-Korean 
relations in early 1994.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean Workers 
(Communist) Party has established two special teams to prepare 
for a sudden and rapid rapprochement with South Korea and the 
United States, a senior government official said Monday. 
  The special teams, which are similar to the task forces that 
China formed to prepare for normalization of diplomatic ties 
with the United States and Japan, are led by Vice President Kim 
Yong-chu, who is President Kim Il-song's younger brother and was 
only a few weeks ago reinstated by the party, and Party 
Secretary Hwang Chang-yop, respectively. 
  "The special teams control all the negotiations related to 
South Korean and U.S. affairs," the official said. "The special 
team for South Korean affairs is headed by Kim Yong-chu and Kim 
Tal-hyon, who was recently dismissed as State Planning 
Commission chairman and vice premier, while the team for U.S. 
affairs is led by Hwang Chang-yop and Kim Yong-sun, a party 
secretary," he said. 
  "North Korea established the teams because Kim Chong-il 
aspires to epochal achievements in foreign and inter-Korean 
relations, including the forming of diplomatic relations with 
Washington, this year, the 20th year since he was named 
successor to Kim Il-song." 
  Kim became chairman of the National Defense Committee last 
year, assuming the big three powers of the party, the government 
and the military, and is expected to take over as party general 
secretary this year. 
  Kim Yong-chu became vice president at a plenary meeting of 
the Workers' Party Central Committee last month while Kim 
Tal-hyon was dismissed as vice premier and State Planning 
Commission chairman "to be transferred to other post."

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 3 KYODO -- Pyongyang's governing 
Korean Workers Party has established two task forces to manage 
relations with South Korea and the United States, a South Korean 
Government official said Monday [3 January]. 
  President Kim Il-song's younger brother Kim Yong-chu and 
veteran economist Kim Tal-hyon have been appointed to jointly 
manage the group dealing with South Korean Affairs, the official 
said. 
  The team set up to take charge of relations with the U.S. is 
headed jointly by Hwang Chang-yop and Kim Yong-sun, both 
secretaries of the Workers Party, he said. 
  "What laid behind the formation of these two special task 
forces seemed to be North Korea's intention to break the logjam 
in its relations with the U.S. and South Korea this year, 
especially as it marks the 20th anniversary of the designation 
of Kim Chong-il, son of President Kim Il-song, as his father's 
successor," said the official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
  North Korea's economy is reportedly in crisis and 
Pyongyang's 
refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear facilities has 
further aroused suspicion that it is secretly developing nuclear 
weapons. The U.S. has put pressure on North Korea to accept 
international inspections of its suspected nuclear facilities 
and clear up doubts about its nuclear intentions. The U.S. and 
North Korea reportedly made progress last week in resolving the 
dispute. 
  Among the North Korean officials named to head the key new 
task forces, Kim Yong-chu, comanager of the South Korean affairs 
team, made a sudden political comeback last month when named 
vice president as part of a top-level personnel shakeup. 
  Kim Tal-hyon, dropped from the post of vice premier and 
chairman of the State Planning Commission in the same reshuffle, 
has reportedly been relegated to the post of manager of a 
chemical factory in Hamhung, North Hamkyong Province. 
  But the South Korean official said that move appeared to be 
purely a symbolic gesture and that Kim Tal-hyon will soon take 
up a high-profile job as a major economic policymaker. 
  A North Korean source at the border village of Panmunjom 
said 
last month that Kim's appointment as a manager of the chemical 
factory did not mean his "downgrading to an idle job."

  [Text] The government has decided to actively help improve 
North Korea's relations with the United States and Japan if the 
third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks are held, it 
was learned yesterday. 
  The government thinks that the northern policy implemented 
by 
the Sixth Republic must have deepened North Korea's isolation, 
thereby leading to the acceleration of its nuclear development, 
and that, therefore, practical assistance to North Korea to open 
itself up will be necessary for the development of inter-Korean 
relations, said a relevant government official on 31 December. 
  Relevant government officials understand that North Korea 
and 
the United States almost agreed to hold the third round of 
high-level talks through a series of working contacts in New 
York and that, accordingly, the inter-Korean dialogue and North 
Korea-U.S. dialogue to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue 
will make rapid progress this year.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Monday that South Korea must solve the North Korean nuclear 
problem without fail this year as it is crucial for the survival 
of the nation. 
  "The North Korean nuclear problem, which is of ultimate 
importance to the survival of the 70 million Korean people, 
should be solved early this year at the latest," Kim said in a 
New Year's ceremony at Chongwadae [presidential offices] 
attended by presidential secretaries and guards. 
  "We had many difficulties trying to solve the nuclear 
problem 
because we needed inter-Korean negotiations and because we had a 
counterpart to negotiate with." 
  He also mentioned rice market opening. 
  "It is important for us to save our agricultural 
communities. 
Rice will be imported beginning next year, but the government 
will buy and process it all for reexport," he said. 
  On industrial relations, he emphasized stability and said 
that the businesses need stable relations between labor and 
management to develop advanced technology and make excellent 
goods, which is necessary to win the competition on the 
international market.

  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam, in his New Year's message to 
the nation today, vowed to eliminate the remaining 
irregularities and corruption this year to build a much cleaner 
society. 
  "In the year 1994, we should move forward toward the world 
and the future on the foundation of what we achieved through 
last year's reform drive," Kim said. 
  "I hope we can all be born anew this year after ridding 
ourselves of such vices as egoism, falsehood, idleness, vanity 
and extravagance," Kim said. 
  "The ongoing anticorruption drive cannot be stopped or 
slowed 
at this point because it is my obligation to construct a just 
society," the President stressed. 
  To survive in the new era of unrestrained international 
competition, he said, "We must concentrate our ability and 
creativity on building up national power. An opportunity, once 
lost, is lost forever. An opportunity always follows a crisis. 
We should take full advantage of the challenge stemming from 
globalization and opening to upgrade our national status," 
President Kim said. 
  Saying that all people should join in the movement to 
strengthen national competitiveness, Kim stressed that each 
member of society should not forget that he or she has an 
important role to play in international competition. 
  "We have to win," he asserted. 
  "We are now at the starting point in our race toward the 
world and future. We can't afford to waste any of our precious 
time on conflict and enmity. Instead of pursuing meaningless 
arguments, we should seek after the practical," Kim said. 
  Touching on the issue of the domestic agricultural market 
opening, the President appealed to the nation to give full 
support to the farmers. He asked the people to focus their 
wisdom and strength on helping the farmers regain hope and 
courage. 
  "Let's work hard to make 1994 the year in which the 
foundation of a New Korea was firmly laid," Kim said. 
  In conclusion, President Kim made a brief mention of the 
North Korean nuclear issue. 
  "I hope the nuclear matter will be resolved this year so 
that 
true peace can come to the Korean Peninsula, which has been 
scarred by division for the past 40 years," Kim said. 
  President Kim called for great efforts to help compatriots 
in 
the North join not only in the worldwide trend of opening and 
reform but also in the creation of a New Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 3 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam has 
picked internationalization, revitalization of the economy and 
reform as the three biggest tasks for the nation in 1994. He 
will carry out his policies, focused on globalization and 
openness, by strengthening the competitive power of the country. 
  His government will push efforts to ease economic and 
administrative regulations and restrictions to make a second 
economic leap in the new economic order brought on by successful 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. 
  The government will try to concentrate the national strength 
for economic revitalization and increased exports through 
stepped-up capital investment and stable industrial relations. 
  To achieve these goals, President Kim believes, the 
political 
foundation has to be stable first. He will, therefore, continue 
to remove factors that breed irregularities and corruption while 
adopting legislation on unified elections, political 
fundraising, and political parties at an early date. 
  At the same time, the administration plans to redraw 
election 
districts in preparations for next year's local elections and 
undertake local administrative reform. 
  An official at Chongwadae [presidential office] said Monday 
that Kim contemplated the three basic policy directions of 
internationalization, economic revitalization, and reform during 
his two-day new year's holiday. 
  Kim's ideas include strategies for internationalization and 
openness in the wake of the Uruguay Round, local elections in 
1995, parliamentary elections in 1996 and the presidential 
election in 1997, the official said. He regards the North 
Korean nuclear issue as the key to inter-Korean relations. He 
plans to map out multilateral strategies for the resolution of 
the issue. His government will work out measures for economic 
cooperation with North Korea and establishment of diplomatic 
relations between Pyongyang and Washington and Pyongyang and 
Tokyo if, or when, the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved, 
the official said. 
  President Kim will actively pursue summit diplomacy for 
closer coordination with the United States, Japan, China, Russia 
and others to maintain peace on the Korean peninsula. 
  He is scheduled to visit Japan in the first half of the year 
to be followed by a visit to Jakarta for the second Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in the second half. 
  The president is expected to spell out his policies in 
detail 
at his first press conference of the year and on other 
occasions, the official said.

<F P=106> ["New Year's message" sent by ROK President Kim Yong-sam to </F>
"the five million overseas Koreans;" place and date not given] 
  [Text] My five million fellow Koreans abroad, 
  1994, the Year of the Dog, is dawning. I am delighted to 
send New Year's greetings to you, although I regret it must be 
over the radio rather than in person. 
  I commend you for all you have achieved through your hard 
work in the face of all manner of hardships in your adoptive 
lands, and for always having been concerned for your home 
country. 
  Fellow Koreans abroad, 
  Last year was a very important year for the future of Korea. 
The era of stagnation and frustration gave way to one of 
dynamism and hope. It was the first year of the New Korea being 
forged through change and reform. The deep-seated legacy of 
misconduct and corruption that was rampant in the past several 
decades is being weeded out, injecting fresh air into our 
society. Korea is becoming a healthy land in which those who 
work hard and honestly can live well. These changes have 
greatly elevated our international stature. 
  Many say that the Asia-Pacific region will continue to be 
the 
most dynamic center of world growth. I am absolutely sure that 
the New Korea we are building will play a leading role in the 
Asia- Pacific age which is certain to emerge in the 21st 
century. Such a New Korea, with its enhanced international 
status, will benefit all the 70 million Korean people at home 
and around the world. It will be a source of encouragement and 
a spiritual haven for overseas Koreans in particular. 
  Overseas Koreans, 
  I know well that you have experienced and still are 
experiencing many difficulties in getting adjusted to and 
integrated into your adoptive societies. I am confident, 
however, that just as our people have triumphed over numerous 
trials and tribulations throughout history, you will never 
abandon yourselves to despair but will eventually overcome 
adversity. I sincerely hope that you will achieve not only 
economic security but also actively contribute to your 
communities. In that way, you will become respected citizens of 
your adoptive countries and demonstrate the excellent national 
traits of the Korean people to the world. 
  I always keep in mind the fact that your, the overseas 
Koreans, are an invaluable asset for Korea. I am making every 
possible effort for your interests. In particular, I am working 
hard to improve our immigration and other pertinent laws and 
regulations so that your will not suffer any trouble and 
inconvenience in visiting or dealing with your homeland. 
  When your home country advances, your own status will rise 
also. Likewise, your success is a source of pride for our people. 
  My fellow Koreans overseas, 
  Our people have a long-cherished goal which we cannot forget 
even while sleeping: The peaceful unification of the divided 
Korea. A unified Korea would certainly be able to play a key 
global role. To that end, North Korea must clear up doubts and 
suspicions about its nuclear intentions. I am doing my best to 
persuade the North, with a sense of kinship and patience, to 
join in the new world order geared to peace, prosperity and 
freedom. 
  Overseas Koreans, 
  The world is now entering an age of fierce economic war, 
replacing the past ideological war. If we do not work hard 
enough, we will skid into the backwaters of history. We must 
strive for a second national foundation and a second liberation. 
Looking ahead into the future, we must be determined to succeed 
in reforming all spheres of national life -- political, 
economic, civic and all others -- so that your home country will 
have become advanced by all measures, including the extent of 
internationalization. 
  Please always remember that you are the pioneers of Korea's 
internationalization and are in a unique position to aid and 
guide our efforts to build a unified and prosperous New Korea. 
Let us pool our strength to construct a great and advanced 
nation so that our posterity can be proud of being born Korea. 
  In greeting 1994, I wish you and your families good health, 
happiness and prosperity. 
  Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report on "special interview" with Prime Minister Yi </F>
Hoe-chang by unidentified reporter on 31 December--place not 
given] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, in a special interview 
with KBS on 31 December, said that reforms in 1994 will be 
centered on improving systems and operations, and that he will 
positively examine measures to enhance the morale of public 
officials. Holding that reforms are for improving systems that 
form the core of the country, he stressed that the government 
will sharpen the national competitive edge and pursue reforms 
through improving systems and operations rather than punishing 
public officials. 
  [Begin Yi Hoe-chang recording] I think that the improvements 
of the bureaucratic society and the state administration are 
intended for improving the country's systems and operations, not 
for punishing public officials. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang said in particular that he will 
map out concrete measures at an early date to improve the public 
servants' welfare in order to raise their morale because they 
are the same ordinary people who have to carry on with their 
lives. He said that he has already drafted a formula on 
improving the promotion system. 
  [Begin Yi recording] Public officials' income will be 
increased by 6.2 percent in 1994. However, I cannot possibly 
say that such an increase will bring better treatment to public 
officials. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Yi disclosed that the government is 
reexamining the overall agricultural policy in the wake of the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round and will set up necessary 
measures by fully reflecting the farmers' opinions and sharing 
the pain of the rural areas through field administration.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Chae-mok based on interview with Foreign </F>
Minister Han Sung-chu by Yi Yong-sik, deputy manager of the 
political department of MUNWHA ILBO; place and date not given -- 
first three paragraphs are introductory remarks by reporter Kim] 
  [Text] Regarding the degree of progress made toward the 
solution of the North Korean nuclear issue, Minister Han said, 
"While some areas have seen positive results thanks to the time 
and effort placed on it, a solution has yet to appear." The 
positive results are that there has been no extreme crisis, that 
dialogue is continuing, and that clues towards a solution still 
remain. 
  Regarding the decision on policy over the North Korean 
nuclear issue, Minister Han said, "The cooperative system 
between the ROK and the United States is firm." He added, "The 
U.S. position notified to the North in the 22 December North 
Korea-U.S. working contact in New York was in fact formulated by 
us." 
  He said, "At the present stage, the ROK and the United 
States 
are pushing ahead with a small package deal so that North Korea 
will allow ad hoc and ordinary inspections [imsi mit tongsang 
sachal] by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and 
participate in inter-Korean dialogue." 
  [Yi Yong-sik] What are the prospects for the third round of 
high-level talks between North Korea and the United States? 
  [Han Sung-chu] If North Korea allows the IAEA to conduct 
complete ad hoc and ordinary inspections and the exchange of 
special envoys between the North and the South to discuss the 
nuclear issue, the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level 
talks will be held. The talks, if held, will be held not in a 
week or two, but at the earliest, towards the end of January or 
in early February. 
  [Yi] In the event that the third round of North Korea-U.S. 
talks are held, what will be the main and auxiliary agenda? 
  [Han] The third round of talks will, first and foremost, 
focus on completely dissolving suspicion on the North Korean 
nuclear program. Our position is that once the precondition of 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue is met, we can discuss 
the issues raised by the North side of guaranteeing security and 
other political and economic issues. 
  [Yi] In connection with the resolving of the North Korean 
nuclear issue, how can we set a political and technical deadline? 
  [Han] The definition of a deadline can vary depending upon 
one's perception of the varying degrees to the resolution of the 
nuclear issue. Since it may be several weeks before the present 
stalemate connected with the crisis of the IAEA's safeguards 
continuity is resolved, the deadline may be several weeks from 
now. Since it may be several months before the suspicion that 
emerged from the disparity between the North Korean declaration 
of its nuclear-related facilities and the IAEA's investigation 
results is dissipated, the deadline may be several months from 
now. 
  [Yi] North Korea is reported to have called for a package 
solution which includes the IAEA's inspection of the North 
Korean nuclear sites and the improvement of North Korea-U.S. 
relations. What specific demands is North Korea making in 
connection with the improvement of relations? 
  [Han] In a statement made on 11 November last year, Vice 
Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu referred to a package solution in 
which the two sides would move simultaneously after determining 
the points of discussion. 
  At the current stage, no concrete details on the method for 
the package deal have been presented. However, we can easily 
guess that North Korea is concerned and interested in the issue 
of guaranteeing security such as the declaration on not waging a 
preemptive nuclear attack on North Korea and the suspension of 
the Team Spirit exercise, and political and economic issues such 
as lifting the designation of North Korea as a terrorist 
country, dissolving the trade embargo on North Korea, and 
assisting in the construction of light water reactors. 
  [Yi] There are many figures in the United States who feel 
the need for the early establishment of diplomatic relations 
between the United States and North Korea.... 
  [Han] It is a well known fact that such figures exist in the 
United States. Another fact is that voices of the hard line 
faction are rising with each passing day in the United States. 
This is an indication that the more North Korea plays for time, 
the less favorable it will be for North Korea. 
  [Yi] Do you think that diplomatic relations between North 
Korea and the United States can be attained in the coming year? 
  [Han] The possibility exists. However, it is not very 
probable. This is because other than the resolution of the 
nuclear issue, there are many preconditions for the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and 
the United States. Besides the resolution of the nuclear issue, 
the United States has deep interest in various conditions such 
as practical progress in South-North dialogue, the control of 
exports of large-scale homicidal weapons like missiles, the 
abandonment of terrorism, the return of remains of U.S. 
soldiers, and the improvement of human rights conditions. It is 
clear that the resolution of the nuclear issue will greatly 
contribute to improving conditions for the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States. 
  [Yi] What is our government's position on the establishment 
of diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United 
States? 
  [Han] Drawing a hasty conclusion on whether or when the 
United States and North Korea will establish diplomatic 
relations is difficult. However, we have already established 
diplomatic relations with the old Soviet and normalized 
diplomatic relations with mainland China. Therefore, opposing 
the establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea 
and the United States even after the resolution of North Korea's 
nuclear issue is shortsighted. Opposing the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between North Korea and the United States 
will not help South-North relations and ultimately, will not be 
of help on the road to reunification. 
  We are fully prepared to actively assist North Korea in 
becoming a responsible member of international society, once 
North Korea's nuclear issue is resolved satisfactorily. 
  [Yi] Is our government making any special preparations 
regarding the possibility of the establishment of relations 
between North Korea and the United States? 
  [Han] Preparations are being made from various angles and 
for various possibilities. However, it is inappropriate to 
reveal details regarding this right now. 
  [Yi] What are the positions of Japan and China on the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between North Korea and 
the United States? 
  [Han] The Japanese Government views the resolution of North 
Korea's nuclear issue as being important to the resumption and 
settlement of currently suspended negotiations between Japan and 
North Korea on diplomatic relations. Therefore, Japan is 
focusing its attention on how dialogue between North Korea and 
the United States is progressing. 
  China does not want North Korea to be isolated in 
international society. Therefore, China welcomes and is 
assisting North Korea in improving relations with Western 
countries. 
  [Yi] If North Korea establishes diplomatic relations with 
the United States, what impact will it have on inter-Korean 
relations? 
  [Han] The improvement of relations between North Korea and 
the United States will come about after the resolution of the 
precondition on the nuclear issue. Therefore, the promotion of 
North Korea-U.S. relations will naturally lead to improvement in 
inter-Korean relations. It will activate inter-Korean exchange 
of people and materials, which had been suspended with the 
exception of indirect trade. By the time North Korea and the 
United States establish diplomatic relations, inter-Korean 
relations may have progressed enough to establish trade missions 
in Seoul and Pyongyang. In short, progress in inter-Korean 
relations and the improvement of North Korea-U.S. relations 
complement one another. 
  [Yi] The establishment of diplomatic relations between North 
Korea and the United States is likely to have substantial impact 
on overall order in Northeast Asia, isn't it? 
  [Han] Even if North Korea improves and normalizes its 
relations with the United States, it will try to restrict 
opening itself up to the outside world, because it fears that 
the aftermath of the establishment of diplomatic relations with 
the United States may endanger the maintenance of its system. 
Therefore, hardly any substantial change in order in Northeast 
Asia can be expected in the short run. In the long run, 
however, it will bring forth very significant change in two 
aspects. First, the establishment of North Korea-U.S. 
diplomatic relations will lead to the normalization of North 
Korea-Japan relations, which will ultimately help North Korea 
cast aside isolation to participate proudly in the international 
community. Second, it will contribute to fundamental changes in 
North Korean society and its overall system of values. 
  [Yi] What direction will diplomatic policy take in the new 
year? 
  [Han] The five basics of a new diplomacy were established 
following the inauguration of the civilian government. The five 
basics are to move into the world, diversify, pluralize, 
cooperate regionally, and to be futuristic. I believe that the 
part on "moving into the world," was especially notable in the 
past year. 
  In a wider sense, prohibiting the spread of large-scale 
homicidal weapons including North Korea's nuclear issue, our 
participation in the UN Peacekeeping Operation, and our 
participation in the free trade system through the settlement of 
the Uruguay Round makes it possible for us to broaden our world 
view to move toward internationalization. The new year's policy 
of a new diplomacy will focus on "pluralism" and "regional 
cooperation." With the inauguration of the World Trade 
Organization and the Green Round next year, the issues of 
environment and development will be prominant and a competition 
policy will be brought to the fore. Therefore, while maintaining 
a secure basis, our diplomacy must extend its domain into the 
fields of economy, communication, environment, and development. 
In addition, multi-faceted cooperation in the Asia-Pacific 
region is increasing rapidly. The Asia-Pacific Economy 
Cooperation summit will be held in Indonesia in November of next 
year, and sometime in July, the first Asian Regional Forum of 
the whole Asia and Pacific region including Russia, China, and 
Vietnam will be held in Bangkok, Thailand.

  [Text] Seoul, Dec. 31 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu called on all diplomatic service members in a New Year 
message Friday to prepare for a trade war and 
internationalization. 
  "Many nations have shed ideological confrontation to seek 
reconciliation and cooperation, and at the same time adopted 
pragmatism, placing their national economic interests as top 
priority," Han said. "An era of boundless competition and trade 
wars opened with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. With the 
hastening of internationalization, global problems such as 
disarmament, human rights, environmental protection and the 
fight against poverty are becoming important issues," he said. 
  International relations in the post-cold war world shifted 
the focus from political and military affairs to economics and 
trade problems, the minister said. Seoul also places its 
emphasis on practical economic interests to join the world's 
advanced economic powers. 
  He recalled an agreement at last month's South Korea-U.S. 
summit for a "thorough and broad" approach to solving the North 
Korean nuclear problem. 
  While promising to keep to this principle, Han said that an 
international action such as by the United Nations Security 
Council was inevitable if North Korea did not come forward 
favorably in the dialogue efforts. 
  South Korea enhanced its ties with both Asia and the Pacific 
at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in 
Seattle in November and the new year will see more participation 
by Seoul in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), 
especially in regional security dialogue, Han said.

  [Text] On 31 December, the Defense Ministry decided that 
if a serious problem arises in safety problems and in supplying 
munitions because of sudden changes in Somalia, it will withdraw 
in advance the ROK Army's Sangnoksu unit which is carrying out 
UN peace keeping activities in Somalia. Originally, the ROK 
Army's Sangnoksu unit was to withdraw from Somalia in July of 
next year. 
  The decision for the withdrawal takes into consideration the 
safety of the ROK Army in Somalia. When considering the fact 
that the Defense Ministry showed hints for the possibility of 
early withdrawal rather than adhering to its policy that early 
withdrawal is impossible, there is high possibility that the 
troops will be withdrawn earlier than scheduled on the occasion 
of the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in the ROK which is 
slated for late March of next year.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 2 January editorial: "Let Us Accelerate the </F>
General Onward March of Socialism of Our Own Style by Highly 
Upholding the Banner of Single-Hearted Unity and Self-Reliance"] 
  [Text] A new year, 1994, full of hope has begun. Today 
our people are welcoming the new year overflowing great pride 
and faith of brilliantly advocating and adhering to socialism of 
our own style amid rigorous trials. 
  Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and 
people, delivered a historical New Year address to all the 
people on the occasion of the new year, 1994. In the New Year 
address, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song proudly summed up 
the results of last year's struggle of firmly adhering to the 
fortress of socialism of our own style through the might of 
single-hearted unity, and presented militant tasks that our 
party and people must adhere to in the new year. 
  The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New 
Year address is a beacon brilliantly elucidating the future of 
our people, who are accelerating the general onward march of 
socialism of our own style, an immortal program calling on the 
whole nation to carry out the sacred cause of the fatherland's 
reunification, and a militant banner that vigorously takes the 
initiative in the independent cause of our era. 
  The respected and beloved leader's New Year address is 
currently inspiring all the party members and workers with faith 
and fighting spirit of the invincibility of the cause of 
socialism of our own style and is vigorously imparting them with 
the responsibility to achieve a new victory by single-heartedly 
uniting around the party and the leader. 
  In 1993, our party and the people vigorously displayed the 
justness of the independent revolutionary line and the might of 
the chuche Korea through the might of single-hearted unity. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: The year 
1993 was a historical year that vigorously displayed the 
justness of our party's independent revolutionary line and the 
might of the chuche Korea. 
  Last year our party and people resolutely smashed 
[chitbusyoborigo] the vicious challenges and aggressive 
maneuvers of the enemies and honorably defended the dignity and 
security of the socialist fatherland. This was the greatest 
victory achieved by our party and people last year. 
  Last year our country was in an extremely acute situation. 
The imperialists and reactionaries isolated and suffocated our 
Republic and strengthened unprecedented offensives in the fields 
of politics, economics, military, and diplomacy to crush [apsal] 
our socialist cause. 
  Our people vigorously launched into the struggle to 
safeguard 
the nation's sovereign rights and revolutionary gains as one by 
bearing in their hearts the indomitable faith and will given by 
the party and the leader and successively achieved victories in 
the political and military confrontations with the enemies. 
  Last year's struggle clearly showed that nothing can squelch 
the resolute will and faith of our people, who are moving toward 
the one road of chuche with firm faith only in their party and 
their leader. Thus, 1993 will be brilliantly recorded in our 
people's revolutionary struggle history as a year of victory in 
our party's revolutionary line and as a great year of victory of 
single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the masses. 
  The last year of the Third Seven-Year Plan was brilliantly 
decorated by achieving great progress in all fields of socialist 
construction. This was an important achievement fulfilled by 
our people last year. 
  Our people resolutely overcame great difficulties and 
barriers facing economic construction, increased the productive 
capacity of our chuche industry on the whole during the period 
of the Third Seven-Year Plan, further strengthened its 
self-dependence, provided a solid basis in agricultural 
production to achieve bumper crops forever, and built many 
monumental creations elucidating the era of the Workers' Party. 
  Today, the communist virtue of helping and guiding each 
other 
throughout the society and sharing joys and sorrows is 
beautifully blossoming, and all the people are enjoying a 
worthwhile and happy life without any social uneasiness. This 
is a clear manifestation of the superiority of socialism of our 
own style. 
  All the victories and results achieved in the revolution and 
construction last year by our people are a brilliant fruition of 
the wise leadership of the party and the leader leading our 
revolutionary cause toward the ever-victorious road under the 
banner of the chuche idea. 
  The leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] is a 
banner for the victory of socialism of our own style and a 
fundamental source for the prosperity of chuche Korea. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, with deep insights into the prevailing 
situation facing the revolution, have presented sagacious 
strategies and tactics in a timely manner and led the entire 
party and all the people to new exploits and victories. 
  Having an iron will and belief and firm fidelity to 
revolutionary principles are important characteristics of the 
leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. When the 
fatherland and revolution were faced with stern trials and when 
a touch-and-go situation prevailed, the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, our supreme commander, took the resolute 
self-defensive measure of declaring a state of semi-war in the 
entire country and had all the people and the entire Army meet 
the enemy's antirevolutionary offensives head-on by launching 
revolutionary offensives. He also vigorously led all the people 
to the grand onward march to glorify the 40th anniversary of the 
victory in the fatherland liberation war as a grand festival of 
the victors. 
  The fact that we won a victory last year in a fierce 
confrontation to defend the country's destiny and the nation's 
supreme interests is unthinkable apart from our party's firm 
belief and incomparable boldness. Outstanding wisdom, 
scientific insights, and a tested organizational capability are 
important features of our party's leadership. 
  Last year, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il released 
"Abuses of Socialism Are Intolerable" and numerous other 
documents and, thus, further developed and enriched a theory on 
building chuche-oriented socialism and clearly elucidated the 
road of the socialist cause of our era. 
  He presents revolutionary economic strategies to comply with 
actual requirements for socialist construction, enhances the 
militant functions of party organizations of various levels, 
scores new upsurges in economic construction, and organizes and 
mobilizes the entire party and all the people by using powerful 
militant slogans. His extraordinary leadership in the party is 
matchless. 
  Recalling the struggle of last year when we brought about 
the 
most brilliant victory amid the sternest trial, we have come to 
cherish deep in our hearts the indomitable belief that as long 
as the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has an iron will 
and tested leadership, leads us, we can win a fight with any 
enemy and complete building socialism of our own style to the 
end. 
  The New Year 1994 is a year of revolutionary change in which 
socialist construction will enter a new stage of development and 
a year of worthwhile struggle in which the entire party, the 
entire country, and all the people must stand up to score 
revolutionary great upsurges in all fronts. 
  In hearty response to the militant call of the party and the 
leader [suryong], all party members and workers must continue 
making innovations and advancements in the spirit of Chollima 
spurred on by the speed of the nineties and, thus, make the New 
Year 1994 a historic year of change in revolution and 
construction in our country. 
  The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has 
taught: We must consolidate and develop our achievements in 
socialist construction and win greater new victories. By so 
doing, we must glorify the popular masses-centered socialism of 
our country and more highly fly the banner of chuche socialism. 
  The international environment facing our revolution today is 
still complicated and tense, and we are building socialism amid 
a tense confrontation with the enemy. 
  In compliance with the prevailing situation and the demand 
for the development of our revolution as the great leader 
elucidated in his New Year address, we must thoroughly implement 
the revolutionary line of independence, self-sufficiency, and 
self-reliant defense; vigorously carry out the three revolutions 
-- ideological, technological, and cultural -- and, thus, 
further strengthen the country's political, economic, and 
military strength. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy put forward at 
the 21st plenary session of the Sixth Party Central Committee is 
a most just and revolutionary line for consolidating the 
nation's self-reliant economic foundations and for further 
upgrading the people's living standard in keeping with the 
demand of socialism. 
  When this strategy is thoroughly implemented, the 
superiority 
of our-style socialism will be more vigorously displayed and we 
will occupy a new stronghold for offensive. 
  This year we should continue to firmly adhere to 
agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy. 
This year, which marks the 30th anniversary of publication of 
the socialist rural thesis, we should vigorously carry out the 
struggle to accomplish historic tasks of rural thesis and should 
effect a new turn in development of the rural economy. Thus, we 
should fulfill the lofty target of grain production set forth by 
the party without fail. 
  At the same time, by vigorously accelerating light industry 
revolution, we should register great innovations in the 
production of consumer goods and should develop external trade 
in compliance with changed circumstances. 
  For us to vigorously accelerate the nation's overall 
economic 
construction by developing agriculture and light industry, we 
should direct strength at coal, electric power, and metal 
industries, and should find a solution to the problem of rail 
transport. 
  For us to successfully carry out economic construction tasks 
facing us this year, we should vigorously wage the struggle for 
increasing production and conservation in all domains and units 
as a mass movement. At the same time, economic guidance 
functionaries should carry out economic organizational work and 
production command in compliance with the demand of the party's 
economic strategy. 
  By upholding the party's cultural revolution policy, 
intellectuals should devotedly struggle to effect a new 
development in all domains of socialist cultural construction. 
  This year we should further strengthen the nation's defense 
capabilities by upholding the leadership of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, our supreme commander. 
  All the people and officers and men of the People's Army 
must 
be fully prepared politically and ideologically, militarily and 
materially, to deal with any contingency on our initiative, and 
must establish a social climate of regarding military affairs as 
important and assisting the People's Army whole-heartedly. 
  What is most important in vigorously pushing ahead with 
revolution and construction at present is to further strengthen 
the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party, and the 
masses and to highly display the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance. 
  Single-hearted unity and self-reliance are imperishable, 
glorious traditions of our revolution, as well as the banner of 
victory. The history of the Korean revolution is the history of 
single-hearted unity and the history of self-reliance. With the 
strength of single-hearted unity our people have broken through 
harsh trials and opened up a brilliant road of victory and with 
the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance we have overcome all 
difficulties and brought about great changes in the revolution 
and construction. 
  Today our single-hearted unity has been firmly consolidated 
with the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as its center. The 
ever-victorious indomitable road of the socialist cause is in 
the firm ideological and moral unity with the party and the 
leader based on will and principle. 
  All party members and working people should hold the leader 
[yongdoja] in high esteem with the sense of loyalty and should 
actively defend and protect him. They should regard the ideas 
and lines put forward by the leader [yongdoja] as most just ones 
and should thoroughly implement them under any condition and 
circumstance. 
  Thus, we should consolidate the single-hearted unity of our 
revolutionary ranks, which has been firmly cemented rock-solid 
under the leadership of our party, and with the strength of such 
unity, we should vigorously push ahead with the socialist cause 
of our own style. 
  Self-reliance and arduous struggle are traditional spirits 
of 
the struggle of our people, who are carrying out the revolution 
and who are a revolutionary banner for successfully building 
socialism of our own style. 
  "Let us accelerate vigorously the general march of 
socialism in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
fortitude." This is the call of our party and the militant 
slogan our people must uphold today. 
  When we advance by upholding this slogan, we can tenaciously 
defend and protect our-style socialism by crushing various 
challenges and disturbance maneuvers of the imperialists and 
reactionaries. We can resolve all problems raised in the 
socialist construction with our own strength under any 
condition, no matter how difficult. 
  Just as in the postwar Chollima great upsurge period, we 
must 
more highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance 
and fortitude and must effect a new upsurge in socialist 
construction by breaking through all difficulties. 
  To reunify the country without fail in the nineties and to 
hand over the reunified fatherland to future generations are the 
supreme tasks of the nation. 
  The principles and line of our party and the government of 
the Republic to establish a unified state in the manner of 
confederation based on one country and one state and two systems 
and two governments remain unchanged. 
  All Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas 
should firmly unite as one, transcending the differences in 
ideologies, systems, and religions under the banner of the 
10-point program of great unity of the whole country and should 
subjugate everything to the cause of national reunification. 
  We should smash at every step aggressive and interfering 
maneuvers of outside forces with the strength of unity of all 
people who want reunification and want to live under democracy 
with patriotism. As members of the Korean state, those who have 
strength, knowledge, and money, should make characteristic 
contributions to the cause of national reunification with 
strength, knowledge, and money respectively. Thus, this year we 
should open a new phase in the struggle for national 
reunification. 
  The United States and its followers should look straight at 
today's realities in which the spirit of national reunification 
is being enhanced higher than ever before, and should act with 
discretion. They should discard the anachronistic way of 
thinking to handle the Korean issue from the standpoint of 
strength. 
  Pressure or threat will have no effect on us; such an 
attempt 
may invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to the 
problem. 
  The imperialists are now blustering on the international 
arena by vociferating about the end of socialism, but they 
cannot arrest the people's aspiration to independence, 
sovereignty, and socialism, nor can they turn back the trend of 
history. 
  In the new year, just as in the past, we will unite with 
socialist countries based on the principle of independence, and 
will make active efforts to unite with nonaligned countries. We 
will develop good neighborly relations with the capitalist 
countries that respect our nation's sovereignty. 
  Upon hearing the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year 
address, our people's revolutionary zeal and spirit of struggle 
are very high. 
  All party organizations should aggressively carry out the 
organizational and political works to brilliantly achieve 
rewarding tasks in the new year. 
  Party organizations at all levels should infiltrate the New 
Year address made this year by the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song deep into party members and working people, and should 
vigorously organize and lead them to the struggle to accomplish 
tasks put forward in the New Year address. 
  Our revolution is an ever-victorious indomitable revolution 
that advances with the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song as 
its vanguard and by following the leadership of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  We have loyal people and one-a-match-for-100 revolutionary 
Armed Forces who are firmly rallied behind the party and the 
leader [suryong]. We also have a mighty self-reliant socialist 
national economy that enables us to survive with our own 
strength under any circumstance. 
  A political and ideological offensive, an economic blockade, 
and a military threat by the imperialists and reactionaries, 
cannot block our people's advance forward. Although our people's 
struggle today is arduous, it is a glorious and sacred struggle 
for prosperity and development of our nation and for the future 
of mankind. 
  Let us all more vigorously fight to accomplish the socialist 
cause of our own style in firm unity with the party Central 
Committee headed by the respected Comrade Kim Il-song by 
upholding the banner of the chuche idea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comes out with an editorial article on the highly important 
tasks for the promotion of the country's reunification set by 
the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year address. 
  It calls upon all the Korean people in the North, the South 
and overseas to wage a nationwide struggle, united under the 
banner of great national unity, thus making this year that opens 
a new phase of national reunification. 
  It quotes Comrade Kim Il-song as saying in his New Year 
address: 
  "The principles and the line of our party and the government 
of our Republic on national reunification remain unchanged. In 
future, too, we will make every effort to reunify the country in 
the form of confederation which is based on one nation, one 
state, two systems and two governments, on the three principles 
of independence, peaceful reunification and great national 
unity." 
  The article says: 
  Our party and the DPRK Government did every possible effort 
last year to implement the 10-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation. But their effort was fruitless due to the 
anti- national, anti-reunification belligerent moves of the 
South Korean authorities. 
  As the South Korean reality indicates, the "civilian regime" 
is only a disguise. It does not differ from the successive 
military dictatorial regimes which had been indulged in 
treacheries. 
  With the Kim Yong-sam fascist "regime" left intact, it would 
not be possible to achieve national reconciliation and unity, 
peace and peaceful reunification, nor would it be possible for 
the South Korean people to free themselves from the colonial 
yokes. It would result only in confrontation and war between 
the fellow countrymen. 
  To check the clamour raised by the United States and its 
lackeys under the pretext of the "suspicion of the North's 
nuclear arms development" is a crucial matter to be solved 
either for peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula or 
for the international justice. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must on any 
account 
be solved through DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Pressure or threat will have no effect on us. Such an 
attempt may invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to 
the problem. 
  The United States must act with discretion, aware of its 
responsibility and position as the very one that caused the 
nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula, and come out to the 
talks with sincere willingness and fair attitude. 
  The three principles of independence, peaceful reunification 
and great national unity which we have consistently maintained 
constitute the nation's common reunification programme most fair 
and aboveboard which fully accords with the Korean people's 
demand for independence and their fundamental interests. The 
form of confederation is the most realistic and reasonable 
reunification formula which reflects the specific conditions of 
the country where different ideologies and systems exist. 
  We will as ever make all efforts to reunify the country 
through confederacy based on one nation, one state, two systems 
and two governments on the afore-said three principles in 
accordance with the policy of national reunification put forward 
by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  All the people concerned for the destiny of the country and 
the nation, whether they be in the North or South or abroad, 
whether they be communists or nationalists, haves or have-nots, 
atheists or theists, must unite with each other as the same 
nation, transcending all the differences, and pave the way of 
national reunification with concerted efforts.

<F P=106> ["Text" of New Year's greetings from the South Korean </F>
National Democratic Front Central Committee to Kim Il-song 
issued in Seoul on 1 January] 
  [Text] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song received a 
congratulatory message greeting the new year of 1994 from the 
South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] Central Committee. 
  The message reads: To the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, 
the sun of the nation: 
  We rang out a year of rewarding struggle in which we 
advanced 
along the chuche banner and are greeting the hopeful new year of 
1994. The SKNDF Central Committee respectfully sends the first 
greeting of wishing the great leader long life with the 
consistent expressions of congratulations by all the vanguard 
fighters and patriotic masses of various strata of the South. 
  The last year of 1993 was a historic year in which national 
prestige of the chuche Korea was exalted further in the entire 
world under the outstanding leadership of the great leader and 
in which a new advance was made in the struggle of the 70 
million fellow countrymen for national reunification. The 
respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who adds 
luster to the chuche chronicles with his unequalled exploits, 
made brilliant achievements for the times and mankind last year 
with his deep insight into the rapidly changing situational 
demands and with his energetic ideological and theoretical 
activities and great practice of the revolution. 
  Last year was marked by the culmination of the antisocialist 
maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries to isolate, 
stifle [chilsik], and crush [apsal] the Northern half of the 
country and pull down the socialist fortress. The great leader 
overcame and made a breakthrough in the manifold difficulties 
and trials with his tested leadership, ever-victorious wisdom 
and strategy, and the might of the wholehearted unity of the 
leader, the party, and the masses, thus powerfully demonstrating 
to the entire world the justness and invincibility of the chuche 
socialist cause. 
  The celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the 7 July 
war victory, which were grandly observed amid great admiration 
of the people at home and abroad, were great festivities of both 
our nation and mankind that built up as an everlasting 
historical monument the immortal achievements of the respected 
and beloved leader, who leads the cause of independence and the 
cause of socialism of our times along the ever-victorious road. 
They were a great epic, which vividly proved the chuche truth 
that the people who pioneer their destiny independently and 
creatively, upholding the great leader and under the leadership 
of the leader, are ever-victorious. 
  With the noble idea of believing in the people as in heaven, 
the great leader has devoted his entire life to the masses, 
setting off on a life journey -- boarding a mass-oriented train. 
Everywhere he gave sacred on-the-spot guidance, which he gave 
so many times last year, miracles and innovations were brought 
forth, enabling the brethren in the North to brilliantly 
conclude the final year of the Third Seven-Year Plan in the 
unprecedented world economic recession and achieved the 
triumphant bumper crop, thus providing the firm foundation of 
self-reliant economy. 
  The 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth Workers' Party of 
Korea 
[WPK] Central Committee, which proudly summed up the Third 
Seven-Year Plan and put forth the revolutionary economic 
strategy, marked another resplendent chapter in the glorious 
history of the WPK, which victoriously pioneers the 
hitherto-uncultivated chuche socialism under the tested 
leadership of the great leader and the dear comrade leader. In 
the land of the North, where the great leader's politics of 
benevolence is in full bloom, all the people enthusiastically 
put into practice last year the noble, beautiful traits of 
devoting themselves silently to the party, the leader, the 
group, and comrades without seeking any honor or compensation. 
Thus, the North society highly demonstrated its prestige as the 
crystal of wholehearted loyalty and filial duty and as a solid 
sociopolitical living organism. 
  Last year, when there was the acute and serious 
confrontation 
between socialism and capitalism, the great leader firmly held 
the control lever of history and elucidated clearly the 
direction and position of the times, thus enabling the world's 
progressive people to advance continuously along the road of 
anti-imperialist cause for independence and of the movement of 
rebuilding socialism. 
  The great leader, who is the lodestar of the fatherland's 
reunification, presented last year the 10-point program of the 
great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the 
fatherland, which is comprehensive of the lofty spirit of 
nation-loving and national independence, thus vigorously 
arousing the 70 million fellow countrymen to the struggle to 
realize the cause of the fatherland's reunification in the 
nineties. 
  The great leader has verified Tangun as the originator of 
our 
nation, who actually lived, thus hardening the belief of all 
fellow countrymen that they are a unitary nation inheriting a 
5,000-year history and enabling them to achieve national harmony 
and great unity. 
  With boundless happiness and pride in living and struggling 
with the great leader as the sun of the nation, we stoutly 
carried out the patriotic struggle to pioneer the nation's 
destiny last year. 
  Our masses in the South made a counterattack on the 
antidemocratic, antinational, and antireunification group, which 
has strangled democracy with feigned reforms, taken pro-United 
States and pro-Japanese flunkeyism and betrayal of the nation to 
intensify its subordination, and pushed South-North relations to 
the dangerous situation on the brink of war by pursuing 
anticommunism and anti-North confrontation since the military 
dictatorship turned into the civilian fascism. By doing so, 
they have unveiled the current regime's mask of a civilian 
government and deepened the crisis of the colonial fascist 
system. 
  Through our struggle in a grave situation last year, we came 
to bear even more firmly the faith that we will achieve the 
victory of the cause of independence, democracy, and 
reunification without fail as long as we have the great leader 
and the immortal chuche idea. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is indeed a benevolent 
sun that leads our SKNDF and other patriotic masses of various 
circles to ceaselessly follow the patriotic road to 
independence, democracy, and reunification under the banner of 
struggle, without wavering in the colonial fascist forces' 
persistent temptation and unyielding under any outrageous 
reactionary offensive, no matter how giddily the dirty flood of 
betrayal and reform overflows from the countries where 
capitalism has been rehabilitated. The immortal chuche idea is 
a brilliant beacon for pioneering our destinies. 
  In the new year, we will accelerate modeling the SKNDF and 
the ranks of the movement for changes after the chuche idea, 
under the brilliant chuche rays and substantially carry out work 
to make the masses in various classes and strata have 
consciousness and to organize them by using the respected and 
beloved leader's memoir. By doing so, we will strengthen the 
independent main forces of the national and democratic movement 
in every way. 
  We will imminently and daringly organize and carry out the 
mass struggle to smash the current traitorous regime that 
pursues flunkeyism, nation-selling, and war, so that we can 
mature the situation of the movement for changes on our own 
initiative. We will also create a wind of nationwide advance 
for independent reunification, upholding the 10-point program of 
the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the 
fatherland, and will make 1994 a historic year of national 
reconciliation and unity. 
  Although the road of struggle is arduous and formidable, our 
just cause will obtain victory without fail as long as the great 
leader exists and the chuche banner vigorously flies at the 
front. 
  This morning of the new year when the ardor of admiring and 
following the chuche sun is filled in every place, the SKNDF 
Central Committee conveys the wish of all the vanguard fighters 
and masses of various classes and strata in the South for the 
longevity of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song who is a 
peerless patriot, a legendary hero, and the father of the nation.

  [Text] The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il received a 
congratulatory message greeting the new year of 1994 from the 
South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] Central Committee. 
  The message reads: 
  To dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, the sagacious leader 
[yongmyonghan chidoja] of the nation: 
  Under the brilliant sun of guidance, an age-shaking year of 
excitement ended and the hopeful new year 1994 has broken. On 
this breaking morning of the new year, the SKNDF Central 
Committee respectfully sends the first greeting of longevity to 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is the sagacious leader of the nation, 
the great leader [yongsu] of the chuche cause, and a talented 
military strategist whom the fellow countrymen and all human 
beings admire, with the consistent wishes of hearty 
congratulations by all the vanguard fighters and masses of 
various strata in the South. 
  The past year of 1993 was a meaningful year when the 
sagacious leader Comrade Kim Chong-il was elected chairman of 
the DPRK National Defense Commission and when the 40th 
anniversary of the 27 July war victory was brilliantly decorated 
with a grand festival of victors. It was also an honorable year 
when the world was shocked by mankind's admiration and epochal 
hymns for the immortal achievements registered by the dear 
leader in 1993. 
  With his insightful and farseeing wisdom, the sagacious 
comrade leader, an outstanding leader [yongsu], presented the 
chuche Korea's policy to overcome piled difficulties and trials. 
He also consolidated the entire party, all the people, and the 
entire Army as a pure social and political living body filled 
with loyalty and filial piety, thus demonstrating the 
invincibility of the masses-oriented, unique socialism. 
  The sagacious comrade leader, an outstanding military 
genius, 
defeated and smashed the enemy's isolating, suffocating, and 
crushing maneuver [chokturui korip chilsik apsal chaektongul 
kyokpa punswaehasigo] and registered the outstanding feat of 
brilliantly protecting the national dignity and the country's 
interests by using his peerless talented wisdom, matchless 
braveness, and iron-strong will last year when the strong 
anti-Republic and antisocialist wind created by the allied 
imperialist forces blew unprecedentedly harshly. 
  The more unscrupulous was the revilement of the imperialists 
and their puppets, who had been pushed into a pitfall of 
successive defeats, the more the northern half of the fatherland 
increased the speed of the general onward march of socialism of 
our own style, upholding the banner of self-relience and 
fortitude, thus victoriously accomplishing the Third Seven-Year 
Plan. The North's farmlands, where the chuche farming method 
advanced, won a victory of achieving bumper crops. All this was 
possible thanks to the sagacious comrade leader and his seasoned 
leadership. 
  At the end of last year, when the North's nuclear issue was 
mentioned again in Washington and Seoul was frantically 
attempting to crushing fellow countrymen while adhering to the 
international cooperation system, Pyongyang, unlike Seoul, 
presented revolutionary economic strategies based on the result 
of summing up the fulfillment of the Third Seven-Year Plan and 
discussed and decided upon the issue of correctly inheriting the 
nation's cultural legacies, which had been presented as an 
important state affair, thus striking the people of the world 
with admiration. 
  From the very composed and peace-oriented attitude of the 
northern half of the fatherland, we could see an overwhelming 
victory of the denuclearization policy over the U.S. nuclear war 
policy [haekchonjaeng chongchaek] as well as the infinite vigor 
of the chuche economic and cultural policies, and could realize 
again the valuable truth that the masses under the seasoned 
leadership of the outstanding leader can vigorously advance 
toward the prosperous future no matter how harsh are the trials 
they are repeatedly faced with. 
  The sagacious comrade leader, who is pioneering mankind's 
cause of independence at the forefront while stoutly grasping 
the rudder of the times, struck a deadly blow to the 
imperialists and betrayers of socialism who try to void and 
distort the true superiority of socialism and enabled the masses 
who are making efforts to rehabilitate socialism to have firm 
faith and will, thus making a great contribution to the 
development of the socialist movement. 
  History tells numerous legends about heroes, however we 
have not witnessed a leader like our sagacious leader who is an 
unequalled iron-willed brilliant commander and excelled 
politician. He has both literary and military accomplishments 
that are not shared by any leader of all times and places, has 
embroidered the history of the nation and mankind with his 
legendary strategies and has blocked raging storms with his own 
body during the period of most stern trials. 
  The sagacious leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great 
incarnation of the chuche politics and peerless great commander 
who has turned an unprecedented steep path and trials into 
favorable conditions overflowing with optimism, thus creating 
new history by turning a misfortune into a blessing. Under the 
wise and tested leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il, the 
sagacious leader of the nation, a remarkable progress was made 
in the movement to reunify the fatherland in the last year. 
  The sagacious comrade leader opened a broad alliance road 
for 
the people wandering about in a quagmire of confrontation and 
mistrust by administering politics of love and trust and 
broad-based politics which embody the idea of believing in the 
people as in heaven, and aroused 70 million countrymen in the 
North, South, and overseas into the plaza of great unity and 
national reconciliation under the great banner of the 10-point 
program of the great national unity for the reunification of the 
fatherland. 
  Even though aggressors and traitorous cliques viciously 
staged anti-peace, antireunification maneuvers in the last year, 
our masses advanced along the road for independent and peaceful 
reunification of the fatherland by kicking out brutal 
suppression of the fascists and girding up themselves with hope 
and grit against disappointment and frustration because the 
sagacious comrade leader, who supports the whole nation's 
immortal will and aspiration for the end of the tragedy of the 
fatherland division and the establishment of a confederal state 
in the nineties', stands firm at the head of our nation. 
  We are convinced of a brilliant tomorrow since we have the 
sagacious comrade leader as the nation's leading spirit 
[yongsu]. Thus, our SKNDF and other patriotic masses kindled the 
flame of anti-U.S.and antifascist patriotic struggle by firmly 
holding the chuche sword without the slightest vacillation 
despite the development of a grave situation in which the 
military dictatorship turned into civilian fascism, strangled 
democracy, and maximized pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese subordination 
and North-South confrontation. 
  The struggle by peasants and masses of various strata 
opposing the rice market opening that erupted from various parts 
of Pyongyang [as heard] liquidated the traitorous cliques and 
completely unveiled the cloak of the civilian regime worn by the 
current regime as the struggle developed into a nationwide 
movement opposing the U.S. imperialists' shameless acts of 
looting. As a result, the colonial fascist rule now faces a 
serious crisis. 
  Our masses, under the banner of the chuche idea, acquired 
deep in their hearts precious experiences during the stern 
course of struggle waged in the last year that, without 
fundamentally reforming the colonial domination system, the 
disgrace and misfortune of subordination and national division 
can never be eliminated. 
  In the new year, we, upholding the banner of the chuche 
idea, 
will accelerate the work to make the masses have consciousness 
and to organize them, and will firmly guarantee the uniformity 
of the leadership and idea among SKNDF ranks so that they would 
be firmly prepared as the main forces of reform. 
  We will ignite the flame of struggle against the current 
fascist regime and wage successive patriotic struggles to make 
the masses have consciousness, become independent, have 
democracy, and realize the 10-point program for the great 
national unity. 
  At this meaningful moment of ushering in the first morning 
of 
the new year, the SKNDF Central Committee respectfully wishes 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, the lodestar of the fatherland's 
reunification and benefactor of the nation's destiny, long life 
with the unanimous expression of wishes by all the vanguard 
fighters and patriotic masses of various classes and strata. 
  [Signed] The SKNDF Central Committee 
  [Issued] 1 January 1994, Seoul

pride into the heart of our people. 
  It recalls that the great leader worked out and published

through confederacy in the '90s. 
  Han Tok-su stresses the need to build up the Chongnyon 
organisation into a powerful patriotic unit rooted among the 
compatriots, defend to the end the socialist country of chuche

  [Text] Pyongyang, December 30 (KCNA) -- In Korea 1993 is a 
year full of stirring events and achievements. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song said: 
  "Smashing every form of challenge and obstructive manoeuvres 
of the imperialists and reactionaries and defending our 
socialism and adding lustre to it are an honourable task which 
is raised before our party and people today." 
  Owing to the imperialists' political and military pressure 
and economic blockade to isolate and stifle the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea, the bastion of socialism, an acute 
situation has been prevailed in Korea this year. 
  The resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint nuclear war 
exercises by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet 
clique created a touch-and-go danger which may lead to a war 
anytime on the Korean peninsula. 
  At that moment, Comrade Kim Chong-il, Supreme Commander of 
the Korean People's Army, issued an order to the whole country, 
the entire people and all the army to enter a semi-war state 
from March 9 and aroused all the people and people's army in the 
noble struggle for defending Korean-style socialism centred on 
the popular masses. 
  When the imperialists and some officials of the secretariat 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency under their baton 
unjustly tried to force a "special inspection" on the DPRK under 
the pretext of its fictitious "nuclear arms development," he saw 
to it that the DPRK declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty to safeguard the dignity of the Republic 
and the security of its people with honor. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il who turns adversity into favorable 
circumstances and brings about only victory with superb strategy 
and penetration was elected chairman of the national defence 
commission of the DPRK at the fifth session of the ninth Supreme 
People's Assembly by the unanimous will of the Korean people and 
the People's Army soldiers. 
  This year, singlehearted unity of the Korean people around 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has been cemented 
remarkably. 
  A military parade and a one million-strong mass 
demonstration 
were held and an evening performance "we won victory" took place 
in the capital city of Pyongyang on July 27, the 40th 
anniversary of the victory of the Korean people in the 
fatherland liberation war, in the presence of the two brilliant 
commanders, President Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  They were a grand national festival that powerfully 
demonstrated the might of the single hearted unity of the Korean 
people who had overcome rigorous trials and the advantages and 
vitality of Korean-style socialism. 
  Voices of faith in the invincible socialism of Korean style 
as well as the immortal song of praise "no motherland without 
you" rang out of the eighth congress of the League of Socialist 
Working Youth of Korea, the national conference of war veterans, 
the meeting of commanding officers and political commissars of 
the Korean People's Army, the national meeting of frontrankers 
in beautiful communist traits and other meetings and functions 
held this year. 
  All the voters cast their ballots for the candidates of 
deputies to the provincial (municipal) people's assemblies at 
the elections held on November 21, demonstrating again their 
deep trust in the people's power and the invincible might of the 
Korean people united in one mind around the party and the leader. 
  Significant achievements have been registered in socialist 
economic construction, too. 
  It was noted at the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth 
Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea held on December 8 that 
the national industrial output increased 50 percent in the 
period of the third seven-year plan (1987-1993) under the grim 
situation which rapidly changed owing to the worldwide political 
fluctuation. 
  The workers of the coal, power and metal industries, in 
hearty response to the New Year address of the great leader 
which defined those industries as the main points of socialist 
economic construction, have won big successes by increasing the 
production capacity and updating the production processes. 
  Many light industrial factories have been built in different 
parts of the country and the existing ones modernized, with the 
result that a new turn has been effected in the production of 
consumer goods. 
  Bumper harvests of rice, maize, potatoes and fruits were 
reported from highlands in the northern part of the country, not 
to speak of Yonbaek, Chaeryong, Yoldusamcholli and other plains 
in the west coastal areas. 
  30,000 flats were built in Pyongyang and many dwelling 
houses 
in Hamhung, Wonsan, Sinuiju, Chongjin and other local cities and 
in farm villages and coal and ore miners' settlements. 
  This year, the tomb of Tangun in Kangdong County was 
unearthed to prove that Tangun was a real historical person and 
the Korean nation is a homogeneous nation with Pyongyang as its 
cradle and with a 5,000 years long history. This is another 
signal event that added shine to the history of the Korean 
nation.

<F P=106> ["New Year Jargon Betraying Sinister Intention" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam in his "New Year address for overseas compatriots" on 
Saturday [1 January] again took issue with the North, grumbling 
that the "problem of North's suspicious development of nuclear 
weapons must be settled without fail", according to a radio 
report from Seoul. 
  This betrays his sinister intention to further intensify the 
maneuvers to do harm to and slay fellow countrymen in the new 
year under the pretext of the North's fictitious "nuclear 
development". 
  As already reported, both the DPRK and the United States, at 
a recent contact, removed a series of hurdles in the way of the 
DPRK-U.S. talks and brought a progress in the talks by showing 
mutual understanding and spirit of cooperation. The outcry 
obtrusively let out by the traitor Kim Yong-sam at this time 
cannot but be condemned as an unpardonable, despicable 
anti-national act. 
  He got an "assurance" from the United States to keep the 
"international cooperation system" in reward for a total opening 
of the rice market of South Korea during his trip to the United 
States in November last year. But afraid that it may burst like 
soap bubbles, he is vociferating about the "nuclear suspicion" 
of the North from the first day of the new year. 
  This shows that the traitor Kim Yong-sam is not interested 
in 
the DPRK-U.S. talks at all but is working with bloodshot eyes 
to torpedo the talks and inflict "sanctions" and put pressure on 
the North. 
  No matter how desperately he is working he cannot block the 
progress of the DPRK-U.S. talks whose prospects are in sight 
for fundamentally settling the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  It is obtrusive of the traitor Kim Yong-sam, who has neither 
a real power nor say and has been totally forsaken by the 
people, to say this or that over the problem to be resolved 
between the DPRK and the United States. 
  The people will never pardon such an out and out flunkeyist 
sycophant as the traitor Kim Yong-sam who is leading the South 
Korean peasants to death by opening the rice market and is 
working hard to do harm to fellow countrymen through the 
"international cooperative system". 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam had better stop acting rashly, 
clearly mindful that the road of treacheries chosen by him leads 
to destruction.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Chong Pong-kil: "Not </F>
Separation But Collusion"] 
  [Text] Broadcast reports from Seoul disclosed the fact 
that Yi Pyong-tae, the recently appointed puppet defense 
minister, was a member of the Hanahoe. 
  The Hanahoe, a political military club at the center of 
criticism from every strata of South Korea, was a powerful group 
of fascist military hooligans basically composed of former 
members of the Chilsonghoe. The Chilsonghoe had consisted of 
seven generals--namely Chon Tu-hwan, No Tae-u, Son Yong-kil, 
Chong Ho-yong, Kwon Ik-hyon, Choe Sung-tae, and Paek 
Un-taek--who hailed from Kyongsang Province and graduated in the 
11th class of the South Korean Military Academy. 
  While under the patronage of traitor Pak Chong-hui following 
the 16 May Coup, they changed the name of Chilsonghoe to the 
Hanahoe when they were pinned with the insignia of major on 
their shoulders. Being on the lookout to seize power, they 
increased membership to approximately 200. 
  Following this, the rascals expanded their area of influence 
to include all graduates between the 11th to 36th graduating 
class of the South Korean Military Academy. Chon Tu-hwan, No 
Tae-u, Chong Ho-yong, and Pak Chun-pyong, the chief culprits 
behind the 12 December coup and the Kwangju massacre, were 
Hanahoe members. Chang Se-tong, Ho Sam-su, and Ho Hwa-pyong, 
the henchmen to traitor Chon Tu-hwan in the Fifth Republic, were 
nests of the Hanahoe. 
  The fact that Yi Pyong-tae, who has assumed the position of 
puppet defense minister, was a member of the notorious secret 
military group shocks the South Korean people. 
  The appointment of Yi Pyong-tae a member of the secret group 
of vicious military gangsters as puppet defense minister by 
puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam all but shows his intention to 
revive the Fifth and Sixth Republics's influence and repeat the 
fascist suppressive rule of the Fifth and Sixth Republics in 
South Korea. 
  As everyone knows, the Kim Yong-sam group has prattled as 
though the Hanahoe had been broken up and took measures as 
though to remove Hanahoe members not only from the puppet 
regime, but also from the military when Traitor Kim Yong-sam 
raved that he would wipe out the Hanahoe members from the 
civilian regime, and the puppet Army announced that 10 colonels 
who were Hanahoe members would be excluded from promotions. 
  However, this was a trick to deceive the South Korean 
people. 
The chieftain of the civilian regime has not separated itself 
from the Fifth and Sixth Republics but are colluding with them. 
  With the people's spirit of resistance growing higher due to 
the rice market opening, traitor Kim Yong-sam attempted to 
appease the people's protests by means of shifting the blame 
onto his stooges and firing them, while naming vicious military 
gangsters to important posts. 
  These facts show that the Kim Yong-sam group has not 
eliminated the Fifth and Sixth Republics's forces and prove, 
even worse, that it drew the rascals into its civilian regime in 
order to resurrect the Fifth and Sixth Republics' military 
fascist terrorist rule. 
  In reality, the Kim Yong-sam group is carrying out fascist 
suppressive rule over the South Korean people more than ever 
before. On 28 December, traitor Kim Yong-sam, during his visit 
to the Seoul District Prosecution Office to check 
end-of-the-year readiness, made outbursts that he would not 
tolerate violent demonstrations. Even before taking office, the 
puppet interior minister, raved that it is okay for the 
investigators to torture political criminals. 
  By following the puppet traitor's suppressive order, South 
Korea is dripping with a warlike atmosphere and the people's 
righteous struggle for independence, democracy, and 
reunification are now being brutally oppressed. 
  Needless to say, the worsening fascist suppressive maneuvers 
of the Kim Yong-sam group are aimed at suppressing and 
obliterating the people's struggle to oppose the rice market 
opening. 
  Attempting to defuse his regime's crisis, puppet traitor Kim 
Yong-sam named the Hanahoe group's military gangsters and 
fascist oppressors whom the South Korean people criticize in 
order to oppress and obliterate the people's antigovernment 
struggle. Nonetheless, this is nothing but a last-ditch 
resistance by one who faces a tragic end. The fascist 
suppression will only heighten the resistance of the people and 
hasten the self destruction.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "They Should Not Act Rashly"] </F>
  [Text] As soon as Yi Pyong-tae of South Korea succeeded 
Kwon Yong-hae as new puppet National Defense minister, he did 
not hesitate in revealing his warmonger's colors. 
  According to a report, he held a news conference on 28 
December and said that the so-called modernization and 
science-orientation of the army are an indispensable trend and 
he raved that he would press ahead with the Yulgok project in 
the future without fail. 
  As everyone knows, the Yulgok project is the work to 
reinforce the puppet army's war capacity. The project has been 
promoted by Chongwadae [presidential office] and the National 
Defense Ministry since the mid-1970's, with a view to 
accelerating preparations for a war of northward invasion. 
  The puppets have so far expended an enormous 3 billion won 
for the Yulgok project, including the full-scale introduction of 
modern war equipment from foreign countries and the development 
of new weapons. In this process, the people have denounced and 
rejected the puppets for their abuse of funds. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring revealed its inner intention to 
further 
accelerate preparations for a northward invasion war, by openly 
saying that the Yulgok project will be constantly promoted and 
that the modernization and science-orientation of the army are 
an indispensable trend. Our nation has clearly remembered the 
miserable calamities and unhappiness our fellow countrymen had 
to suffer when war broke out approximately 40 years ago. Thus 
our nation unanimously hopes for the absence of war on the 
Korean peninsula and the establishment of peace. 
  To ensure peace on the Korean peninsula, the North and the 
South should not conduct an arms race, but realize disarmament. 
Peace is inconceivable apart from disarmament. Because the 
North and the South have confirmed the nonaggression that the 
North and the South should not use armed forces against each 
other and not invade each other with armed forces, the issue of 
disarmament arises as an urgent issue that brooks no further 
delay. If one side takes the road to reinforce military 
expenditures, this will bring the result of aggravating the 
North-South confrontation and, thus, the outbreak of war. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet ring, raving that peace can be 
maintained by reinforcing strength, has increased the puppet 
troops, introduced hundreds of missiles from the United States, 
and acquired war equipment on a full scale. The Kim Yong-sam 
puppet ring has earmarked over one billion won for next year's 
military expenditure, up 9.6 percent over last year's figures. 
  Reinforcement of armed forces cannot abide by peace. It goes 
without saying that a reinforcement of armed forces is 
tantamount to preparing for war. Even though the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet ring babbles about the superiority of one's fellow 
countrymen over the foreign forces, it decided to constantly 
promote the Yulgok project which the people reject, by using the 
pretext of its so-called civilian- controlled regime. This 
clearly shows that the Kim Yong-sam puppet rings are the 
military rascals and warmongers of a civilian-controlled regime, 
not different from their predecessors that incited fever for the 
preparations for war. This also actually proves who really 
desires peace and who really schemes war on the Korean peninsula. 
  What cannot be tolerated is that on 24 December, the 
so-called puppet national defense minister ordered the puppet 
commanders and staff to be prepared to mobilize at any time and 
make full preparations to carry out operations as the year-end 
days draw near. 
  The South Korean puppet army is already alert enough for 
mobilization at anytime. The order to get ready for 
mobilization anytime is a move to ignite the fuse of a northward 
invasion war by further driving the situation to the brink of a 
war. This is an unpardonable challenge to the people's desire 
for peace reunification. 
  Peace is still being maintained on the Korean peninsula 
where 
enormous armed forces confront each other along the Military 
Demarcation Line and where the South Korean puppets' war 
maneuvers become more vicious. This is the result of our 
patient efforts. Even though we value peace, we will never 
pardon aggressors provoking us. Reinforcement of armed forces 
and aggravation of tension only brings the ruin of the 
civilian-controlled regime. The Kim Yong-sam puppet ring should 
clearly know nothing will be gained from the adventurous war 
maneuvers and should not act recklessly.

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and President Kim 
Il-song held talks on bilateral, regional, and international 
issues in Pyongyang today. Later, a Foreign Office spokesman 
told reporters that the talks, which lasted for about two hours, 
were held in a cordial atmosphere. 
  President Kim Il-song said that his country supports the 
inalienable right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people 
in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security 
Council. He said we still adhere to the stand we had taken on 
the Kashmir issue during the visit of the late Zulfiqar Ali 
Bhutto to the DPRK in 1976. 
  Benazir Bhutto apprised the DPRK president of the Indian 
policy of brutal repression in Kashmir and occupied Kashmir. 
She also informed him of the background of the foreign 
secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan due to be held 
on Sunday. She emphasized that India should give categorical 
assurance that state terrorism will be stopped in occupied 
Kashmir, the siege of the Hazratbal Shrine will be lifted, the 
number of Indian troops in the occupied valley will be reduced, 
and the political prisoners in occupied Kashmir will be 
released. She expressed the hope that India will forsake 
intransigence and adopt a reasonable attitude. 
  The prime minister also apprised the DPRK leader of 
Pakistan's stand on nuclear nonproliferation and said that 
Pakistan is ready to accept restrictions on the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons at the international and regional levels. In 
this context, she referred to Pakistan's proposal for a 
five-nation conference on nuclear nonproliferation, which has 
been supported by the Chinese Government. She said Pakistan 
supports the DPRK president's view that after the end of the 
Cold War, all countries should observe the UN Charter. Bhutto 
added that Pakistan opposes any country's hegemony or domination 
over another. In the past, Pakistan and the DPRK have resisted 
political and economic hegemony and the two countries should 
hold mutual consultations in this regard in the future as well. 
  Concerning the reunification of the two Koreas, Benazir 
Bhutto said the people of Korea should settle this issue 
themselves without any outside interference. 
  The prime minister assured President Kim Il-song that 
Pakistan is ready to assist in removing differences between the 
DPRK and the United States on the nuclear issue. 
  President Kim Il-song endorsed the Pakistani prime 
minister's 
view that a new global economic system should be evolved through 
negotiations among the poor countries. He also underscored the 
need for an exchange of visits of delegations from the two 
countries to promote cooperation in various fields. The prime 
minister said Pakistan can benefit from the experience of the 
DPRK in the social sector because the DPRK has succeeded in 
alleviating poverty and solving housing problem. She said the 
two countries will further increase cooperation in the fields of 
irrigation and hydroelectric schemes. The prime minister 
invited President Kim Il-song and the DPRK prime minister to 
visit Pakistan, which was accepted. [passage omitted on Bhutto

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries a by-lined article titled "Highly Important Work 
Illumining Path to Socialism in Our Age" upon the lapse of two 
years since the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published the 
immortal classical work "The Historical Lesson in Building 
Socialism and the General Line of Our Party" on January 3, 1992. 
  The article says: 
  The work is a classic one that scientifically analyzed the 
historical lesson in building socialism and fully proved the 
validity and invincible vitality of our party's general line of 
socialist and communist construction. It is also a highly 
important work that makes it possible to restart the socialist 
movement and further strengthen and develop it as demanded by 
the era of independence. 
  In the work the dear leader exposed the essence of the 
reactionary sophism of the imperialists and the renagades of 
socialism describing the frustration of socialism in some 
countries as a change in the historical trend. He, on the basis 
of a scientific analysis of the reasons for the collapse of 
socialism in some countries, gave a comprehensive exposition of 
the questions arising in steadfastly defending and accomplishing 
the cause of socialism. It reflects the unshakable stand and 
will of our party and people to firmly defend the cause of 
socialism under any circumstances. 
  The significance and vitality of the work find expression, 
first of all, in that it made clear in a scientific way the 
reasons for the frustration of socialism in some countries, so 
as to reconstruct the socialist movement on a new basis and 
advance it more vigorously. The work profoundly indicated the 
basic reasons for the frustration of socialism in some 
countries: One of them is that they did not put the main 
emphasis on strengthening the motive force for building 
socialism and on enhancing its role because they failed to 
understand the essence of socialism centering on the popular 
masses, the makers of history. Another reason is that they 
failed to recognize the qualitative differences between 
socialism and capitalism and did not adhere consistently to the 
fundamental principles of socialism. And it is also the reason 
that they had not strengthened international solidarity based on 
independence in relations between parties of socialist countries. 
  With those reasons clarified in the work, a precious 
guideline for reconstructing the socialist movement on a new 
basis and invigorating it has been provided. And it has been 
possible for the world revolutionary parties and peoples 
struggling for socialism to fight more vigorously for the 
victory of the socialist cause with renewed confidence and 
optimism, well aware of the lesson of the history. 
  The significance and vitality of the work is also manifested 
in that it fully proved the validity and invincible vitality of 
our party's general line of socialist and communist 
construction, thus encouraging our party and people to further 
promote the cause of Korean-style socialism under the banner of 
the chuche idea. 
  In our country the cause of socialism is now being 
steadfastly defended and advanced ever victoriously in spite of 
all the forms of challenge and maneuvers by the imperialists and 
reactionaries. 
  This is attributable to the fact that the great leader 
President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
put forward the most correct line of socialist and communist 
construction and have wisely guided its thorough implementation. 
  The great leader was the first in history to put forward the 
general line of building socialism and communism by carrying out 
the three revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, 
while strengthening the people's power and enhancing its 
function and role. 
  In the work the dear leader scientifically and theoretically 
vindicated our party's general line of socialist and communist 
construction and comprehensively reviewed the great victories 
and achievements won by our party and people in socialist 
construction by constantly tackling and successfully 
implementing it. 
  Our people have the unswerving faith through their life that 
our party's line of socialist and communist construction is most 
just and they can accomplish the cause of socialism only in 
accordance with it. 
  Indeed, the publication of this immortal work which is of 
weighty theoretical and practical significance in the completion 
of the socialist cause in the era of independence is another 
great exploit of the dear leader in the accomplishment of the 
human cause of independence, the cause of socialism.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Awakening the Party Members and </F>
Workers to Class Consciousness Is an Important Demand in 
Advocating and Adhering to Socialism of Our Own Style"] 
  [Text] Advocating and adhering to socialism of our own 
style is the most honorable and lofty task facing our party and 
people today. One of the important problems in advocating and 
adhering to socialism of our own style from the 
antirevolutionary offensive of the imperialists and 
reactionaries is to awaken the party members and workers to 
class consciousness. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: At a 
time when the situation is very complicated, it is important to 
carry out class indoctrination well so that the party members 
and workers can be awakened to class consciousness. 
  Awakening the party members and workers to class 
consciousness involves the enhancement of class consciousness to 
make them hate the exploitative system and exploitative class, 
resolutely struggle against the exploitative system and 
exploitative class, advocate and adhere to the gains of 
socialism, and struggle to the end to complete the socialist 
cause. 
  The importance of awakening party members and workers to 
class consciousness as an important demand in advocating and 
adhering to socialism of our own style lies in making it 
possible to strengthen the main force of our revolution and 
enhancing its role. Strengthening the main force of the 
revolution and enhancing its role is a fundamental problem in 
the struggle to advocate and adhere to socialism of our own 
style. The main force of the revolution is directly in charge 
of the struggle to advocate and adhere to socialism and a 
powerful driving force in the socialist cause. 
  It is important to awaken the party members and workers to 
class consciousness in strengthening the main force of the 
revolution and enhancing its role. To strengthen the main force 
of the revolution the popular masses must be firmly armed with 
the independent revolutionary ideology and the socialist and 
communist ideology, and firmly unite them through ideological 
will around the party and the leader. To achieve this, they 
must be awakened to class consciousness. 
  The working class' class consciousness is the core in 
socialist ideology and the basis in socialist indoctrination is 
class indoctrination. Therefore, class indoctrination must be 
strengthened among the party members and workers so that when 
class consciousness is awakened they can all the more be firmly 
armed with the socialist and communist ideology and all the more 
firmly unite around the party and the leader to extraordinarily 
strengthen the main force of the revolution. 
  The class consciousness of the party members and workers 
must 
be awakened so that their revolutionary enthusiasm and 
creativity can be enhanced to heighten the role of chuche. 
  Class consciousness is a decisive element in regulating the 
people's role in carrying out the revolution and construction. 
Class consciousness also regulates the characteristics of class 
consciousness in the behavior of the people taking part in the 
revolutionary movement and on how much they are manifesting the 
strong will and struggle might. 
  The role of the ideological will in the revolutionary 
movement is dependent on its characteristics and content. Only 
people who are armed with the ideology of advanced class and the 
revolutionary ideology of the working class can have a correct 
class position in the revolutionary struggle and construction 
work, and struggle to the end by overcoming all kinds of 
difficulties and trials. 
  Therefore, when the class consciousness of the party 
members and workers is raised, they can demonstrate high 
revolutionary enthusiasm and positive creativity in the struggle 
to defend and maintain the socialist cause and victoriously 
advance it to significantly enhance the role of chuche. 
  Another reason why awakening the party members and workers 
to 
class consciousness is an important requirement for defending 
and maintaining socialism of our own style is that it enables us 
to firmly adhere to revolutionary principles in carrying out the 
socialist cause. 
  Adhering to revolutionary principles in carrying out the 
socialist cause is an important issue in defending and 
maintaining socialism. The revolutionary principle on defending 
and embodying the popular masses' demand of independence must be 
consistently maintained to defend and maintain the socialist 
cause and advance it. Only when the class consciousness of the 
party members and workers is raised, they will consider 
socialism to be their belief and persistently adhere to 
revolutionary principles in carrying out the socialist cause. 
  Socialist, communist construction is being carried out amid 
a 
fierce class struggle. For the popular masses to defeat all 
obstructionist maneuvers by the imperialists and reactionaries 
and defend, maintain, and complete the socialist cause to the 
end, they must have a firm belief in socialism. 
  People will believe in socialism only when their class 
consciousness is raised. Party members and workers will 
consider socialism to be their belief and constantly adhere to 
revolutionary principles in carrying out the socialist cause 
when we further strengthen indoctrination in class consciousness 
among the party members and workers and when, as a result, they 
have a full understanding of the reactionary nature of 
capitalism and imperialism and the inevitability of their ruin, 
the justness of the socialist cause, and the inevitability of 
the victory of socialism. 
  Another reason why awakening the party members and workers 
to 
class consciousness is an important requirement for defending 
and maintaining socialism of our own style is that it enables us 
to thoroughly crush [chippusilssuikke] the antirevolutionary 
maneuvers of imperialists and class enemies. The struggle to 
carry out the socialist, communist cause entails a fierce class 
struggle against all sorts of class enemies. 
  Those imperialists are continuously clinging to the policy 
of 
strength and threatening the socialist countries militarily. 
They are also perpetrating all sorts of cunning maneuvers to 
disintegrate socialist countries politically and economically, 
ideologically and culturally. 
  Inspired by the imperialists, the remnants of the hostile 
classes of socialist society [sahoejuui sahoe naebue namainnun 
choktaegyegubui chanyobunjadul], are also maneuvering overtly 
and covertly [umuro yanguro chaektong] to overthrow the 
socialist system and revive a capitalist system. This is a 
fierce class struggle of who beats whom [igussun nuga nugurul 
hanun chiyolhan gyegup tujaeng imnida]. In this struggle, the 
people cannot defend and maintain socialism, a revolutionary 
achievement which was won with blood, without thoroughly 
crushing [chippusiji] the antisocialist maneuvers of 
imperialists and the remnants of the overthrown class of 
exploiters. 
  Enhancing the awakening to class consciousness of the party 
members and working people is important to smashing the 
anti-socialist maneuvers of the imperialists and class enemies. 
It is necessary to strengthen class indoctrination of party 
members and working people to uncompromisingly wage a struggle 
to correctly differentiate friend from foe, endlessly hate the 
imperialists, landlords and capitalists, oppose the exploiting 
system and class enemies, and defend and adhere to the socialist 
system. 
  Thinking that people would naturally possess socialist 
ideology if the socialist system was firmly established and 
people's material and cultural lifestyles were enhanced, the 
ruling parties in the former Soviet Union and eastern European 
countries did not work hard enough at the work to enhance 
people's awakening to class consciousness. As a result, 
individualism and egoism seriously developed among party members 
and working people, and anti-socialist ideology flooded in from 
outside bringing about ideological permutation. It was 
inevitable for these countries not to be able to overcome the 
antirevolutionary offensive of the imperialists and bourgeois 
welfarists and for socialism to be frustrated as the parties of 
these countries gave up the ideological indoctrination works of 
enhancing the awakening to class consciousness for their party 
members and working people. 
  Socialism is a society where ideology is its life. Socialism 
wins if the party of the working class strengthens class 
indoctrination-based socialist ideological indoctrination work 
so that the popular masses are armed with socialist ideology and 
unite as one on that basis. Socialism collapses if the party 
gives up ideological indoctrination work and the popular masses 
become ideologically ill. 
  Taking the enhancement of the awakening to class 
consciousness for party members and working people as one of the 
important problems related to socialism's destiny, our party has 
ceaselessly deepened the class indoctrination work for them. 
The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth a policy 
concerning the strengthening of class indoctrination early in 
the days of basic socialist construction and wisely led us to 
strengthen class indoctrination work for the party members and 
working people in conformity with the demands of revolutionary 
development. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il put forth the 
unique ideology to further strengthen the class indoctrination 
work in conformity with our revolutionary development's new, 
higher-stage demands of modelling the whole society after chuche 
idea, and wisely led us to carry it out in diverse forms and 
ways. 
  Today in our country, single-hearted unity of the leader 
[suryong], the party, and the popular masses is strengthened as 
iron and the people's awakening to class consciousness is being 
heightened as the socialist ideological indoctrination work 
based on class indoctrination is being vigorously carried out 
among the party members and working people under the wise 
leadership of our party. 
  Coping with imperialists and reactionaries' antisocialist 
and 
antirepublic maneuvers which is becoming more severe with each 
passing day, we should further strengthen our class position and 
better prepare the party members and working people for becoming 
resolute revolutionary fighters who defend, adhere to, and 
elucidate socialism of our style with their lives by ceaselessly 
deepening the ideological indoctrination work to awaken their 
class consciousness.

  [Text] Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- The legendary 
Chollima, a symbol of the revolutionary stamina of the Korean 
people, has spread its wings for another leap. 
  With the pride in having carried out the Third Seven-Year 
Plan (1987-1993) under the changed situation and manifold 
hardships, the Korean people have risen up again in a fruitful 
struggle to carry through the revolutionary economic strategy of 
the party. 
  At the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth Central Committee, 
the Workers' Party of Korea, on the basis of a profound analysis 
of the changed situation and actual demands of socialist 
construction in our country, set two or three years to come as a 
period of adjustment in socialist economic construction and put 
forward a strategic policy of directing primary efforts to 
agriculture, light industry and foreign trade in this period. 
  "Let us bring about a great upsurge in economic construction 
in the spirit of Chollima spurred on by the `Speed of the 90's'!" 
  In response to this militant slogan of the party, the 
Working 
People of Korea are hardening their determination to carry 
through the new strategic policy of socialist construction. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said: 
  "Just as we have advanced so far, upholding the 
revolutionary 
slogan of self-reliance and hard struggle, so in the future we 
should hold high this slogan and smash the anti-socialist moves 
of the imperialists and the reactionaries and accomplish the 
socialist cause." 
  Still alive are the spirit and the stamina with which they 
brought about a great upswing of Chollima in response to the 
resolution of the historic December, 1956, plenary meeting of 
the Central Committee of the party calling them to maximum 
production and economy in the days when the internal and 
external situation was grim after the war. 
  The revolutionary banner of self-reliance and hard struggle 
was the only banner that we had to hold high when we were 
reconstructing the economy with bare hands on war ruins. 
  Our people, upholding this revolutionary banner, shattered 
the silly talk of the enemy that Korea would not be able to rise 
again in a hundred years and turned Korea into a socialist 
industrial state from scratch in the spirit of Chollima that 
gallops ten steps, nay a hundred steps, when others take one 
step. 
  By effecting another great upsurge in socialist economic 
construction in this revolutionary spirit, the Working People of 
Korea are building our-style socialism into an invincible 
bulwark, resolutely smashing the moves of the imperialists and 
the reactionaries to blockade and stifle the DPRK economically. 
  The whole country is seething with revolutionary enthusiasm, 
though it is not long after the new policy of socialist economic 
strategy was set forth. 
  Mass meetings to carry through the resolution of the plenary 
meeting were held in all parts of the country. 
  More than 100,000 Pyongyang citizens held a mass meeting and 
resolved to take the lead in carrying through the new strategic 
policy of the party. 
  In accordance with the strategic policy of the party, the 
agricultural working people are pushing ahead with the work for 
completing the technical revolution in the countryside set forth 
in the rural theses and carry on farm work on a scientific and 
technical basis as demanded by the farming method of chuche so 
as to place all sectors of agricultural production on a new, 
higher level. 
  Well-planned operations have been launched to modernize 
light 
industrial factories still further, expand the variety of 
consumer goods and decisively improve their quality. 
  And a thorough-going organizational work has been undertaken 
to increase the production of exports in all fields of the 
national economy and actively explore foreign markets for a new 
turn in the development of foreign trade. 
  The work of economic organisation is geared to the new 
economic strategy. 
  The working people of Korea are making energetic efforts to 
create "the speed of general march of our-style socialism" with 
confidence in victory and optimism, undaunted by any political 
and ideological offensive of the imperialists and the 
reactionaries and their economic blockade.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 3 (KCNA) -- It is the 
revolutionary spirit pertaining to the Korean people to advance 
full of confidence and optimism along the straight road of 
chuche, says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article Sunday [2 
January]. 
  The revolutionary spirit of our people who are advancing 
along the straight road of chuche finds a graphic expression in 
that they firmly arm themselves with the great chuche-based idea 
of socialism and think and act only in accordance with its 
requirement and that they are making strenuous efforts to defend 
and thoroughly implement the party's line and policies, the 
article says, and continues: 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, basing himself on the 
chuche idea founded by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, has 
developed and perfected the idea of socialism from a new angle. 
The chuche-based idea of socialism proves that socialism is the 
most advanced society where the popular masses are the masters 
of everything and everything serves them and which is steadily 
developed by their concerted efforts. As our people have firmly 
armed themselves with the chuche idea they cherish the justness 
of the socialist cause of chuche as their faith and dynamically 
advance along the road of socialism without wavering under any 
anti-socialist whirlwind. 
  Today our people's struggle to defend and build socialism is 
immediately a struggle to implement the party's line and 
policies. At the 21st plenary meeting of the 6th party Central 
Committee our party, on the basis of a profound analysis of the 
changed circumstances and the realistic demands of our socialist 
construction, set the three years to come as a period for 
adjustment in socialist economic construction and put forward a 
strategic agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign 
trade-first policy. Our people find their way in the line and 
policies of the party and deem it as the requirement of a worthy 
life to defend and implement them and turn out dynamically to 
this end. As they have a definite stand toward the party's line 
and policies, our people are displaying a high revolutionary 
spirit and militancy and creating new miracles and feats in 
carrying them through. 
  The revolutionary spirit of our people is also manifested in 
solving all problems by themselves in the high revolutionary 
spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, the article says. 
  Noting that it is the revolutionary spirit of our people to 
decisively counter the base maneuverings of the enemies with 
redoubled courage in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance 
and fortitude, the article stresses that for this the 
foundations of our independent socialist national economy are 
firmly consolidated with each passing day and our political, 
economic and military might strengthened still further.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese at 2310 GMT on 1 January 94, in its "New Year Interview 
Program With Heads of Ruling Parties," carries a 108-minute 
series of recorded interviews with heads of ruling coalition 
parties -- Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ]; Tsutomu Hata, representative of Shinseito 
[the Japan Renewal Party]; Koshiro Ishida, chairman of the 
Komeito; Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party 
[DSP]; Masayoshi Takemura, representative of Sakigake [the 
Harbinger Party]; Satsuki Eda, representative of the United 
Socialist Party [USP] and Yasumatsu Hoshikawa, representative of 
the Democratic Reform Coalition -- by NHK commentator Takashi 
Yamamoto and NHK announcer Atsuko Yamada at NHK's Tokyo studio. 
  At 2311 GMT, Yamamoto begins an interview with Murayama by 
asking the latter about policy differences between the SDPJ, the 
Komeito and Shinseito. In response, Murayama says: "As I always 
said, political parties which have policy conflicts and 
different political beliefs form a coalition government to 
cooperate with each other in the search for a policy consensus, 
and this is the character of a coalition government. It is a 
matter of course that coalition partners have differing policy 
views." Stressing the importance of intracoalition debate to 
narrow the policy differences, Murayama says, "Viewing the 
debate as a confrontation misses the point." Murayama also says, 
"I think the intracoalition debate will consolidate the 
foundation of the coalition government." Discussing policy 
conflicts among the coalition partners, Murayama denies the 
existence of differences among the coalition partners over a 
package of political reform bills under deliberation in the 
lower house, saying "The coalition partners have already agreed 
on the package." Murayama also adds the coalition partners will 
coordinate their views if there are any differences among them 
on revising the bills. 
  Asked by Yamada about the SDPJ's position in the coalition 
government, Murayama stresses the need to stabilize the 
foundation of the coalition government and says: "The passage of 
the political reform bills holds the key to stabilizing the 
coalition government, and it is important for the coalition 
government to seek bold policies on the basis of that 
stabilization." Murayama also adds "the SDPJ should take the 
responsibility for bolstering the coalition government." Asked 
by Yamamoto if the SDPJ has displayed no significant leadership 
in the coalition government, Murayama says: "I believe that 
since the coalition partners have different political beliefs, 
what the SDPJ advocates is hard for the rest of the coalition 
partners to accept." Asked by Yamamoto about the possibility of 
the SDPJ backing out of the coalition government, Murayama says: 
"Popular consensus shaped in the July general elections is that 
38 years of politics by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
should be ended, and the consensus has developed into a major 
trend among the people. The SDPJ joined the coalition government 
out of its need to respond to the high public expectations for 
an end to LDP politics. Since the SDPJ joined the coalition 
government, it should play a role in changing Japan's politics 
and fulfilling the people's high expectations." 
  Asked by Yamada about political reform, Murayama notes the 
delay in the deliberations of the package of political reform 
bills in the upper house and says: "My view is that since both 
ruling and opposition parties have pledged to push for political 
reform, the package of political reform bills will be passed in 
the upper house. The passage of the bills in the upper house 
will stabilize the political situation and consolidate the 
foundation of the coalition government, enabling the government 
to push ahead with bold policies." 
  Asked by Yamamoto about the possibility of dissolving the 
lower house, Murayama says, "I believe that if the political 
reform bills are not passed or are killed in the Diet, the 
Hosokawa Cabinet would be held responsible. As I said earlier, 
the lower house must not be dissolved at a time when Japan is 
gripped with a serious recession. If the Hosokawa cabinet is 
held politically responsible for failing to pass the political 
reform bills in the Diet, there would be no alternative but to 
dissolve the lower house, but this is a matter to be decided by 
the prime minister. I think the dissolution of the lower house 
should be averted at all cost." 
  Asked by Yamada why the SDPJ is opposed to raising the 
consumption tax, Murayama says, "I am against any argument for 
raising the consumption tax to make up for a fiscal revenue 
shortfall resulting from cuts in the income tax because this new 
taxation arrangement will hit wage earners," adding that the 
government should issue bonds to make up for the fiscal revenue 
shortfall instead. 
  Discussing the issue of cutting the income tax and 
raising the consumption tax, Murayama says, "If the income tax 
is cut and the consumption tax is raised at the same time, this 
would fuel a sense of unfairness among the people and would not 
serve to stimulate the economy." 
  Discussing a realignment of established political parties, 
Murayama says: "There is talk that the established political 
parties should be realigned into two conservative parties. I 
think the talk is out of the question. The realignment of 
established political parties into two conservative political 
parties runs counter to democracy. I am in favor of the moderate 
multiparty system Prime Minister Hosokawa has broached. I 
believe the multiparty system is inevitable. The time has passed 
when a single party will continue to stay in power. The time has 
come when multiple parties form a coalition government. The SDPJ 
intends to play its part in the multiparty system as a party 
that upholds the social democracy. The SDPJ also intends to work 
hard to maintain its influence as a political organization while 
shoring up the coalition government." Murayama goes on to say 
that the SDPJ will seek to rally liberal forces. 
  Asked by Yamamoto about the possibility of the SDPJ's 
seeking 
an alliance with the LDP, Murayama says the LDP should transform 
itself into a more liberal party and adds, "We will seek an 
alliance with liberal members of the LDP." Asked by Yamamoto 
about the possibility of a split in the SDPJ, Murayama says, 
"There are various groups in the SDPJ and they should not take 
any actions that lead to a party split." Yamamoto and Yamada end 
the interview with Murayama at 2334 GMT after thanking him. 
  At 2335 GMT, Yamamoto begins an interview with Shinseito's 
Hata and points out that the ruling parties and the government 
are not in step. In response, Hata says: "There have been turns 
and twists. A ruling party agonized a lot when it decided to 
accept the GATT compromise proposal calling for a partial 
opening of the Japanese market. The ruling party made the 
decision based on the conclusion that it is necessary to make 
the Uruguay Round a success to defend free trade. I do not care 
at all about the existence of the turns and twists." 
  Asked by Yamamoto if the coalition partners will run into 
difficulty coordinating their views with the SDPJ in the future, 
Hata says: "The SDPJ had continued to exist as a main opposition 
party while upholding its own ideology. Whenever I have met with 
members of the SDPJ, however, I have found them changed a lot 
since the end of the Cold War. They have become broad-minded. I 
have continued to discuss political reform and other issues with 
them. I have felt little difference between me and them when we 
have discussed the future of Japan." 
  Asked by Yamamoto about the possibility of Komeito's and 
Shinseito's forming a new party, Hata says, "It would be good if 
the Komeito and Shinseito, and many other parties discuss ways 
to form a new party." Asked by Yamada if he still sticks to his 
plan for two political forces, Hata says: "I have stuck to the 
plan for seven or eight years since I was with the LDP. I think 
that as the current electoral system changes, a situation will 
be created wherein two major political forces are formed." Asked 
by Yamamoto what he means by the two political forces, Hata 
says, "I think that the term conservative or reformist is 
obsolete." Asked by Yamada if he envisions a split in the LDP in 
the course of rallying the two political forces, Hata says: 
"Yes, the LDP has already begun to fall apart. I believe that 
there is a possibility that the LDP will split when the 
established political parties are realigned." Yamamoto asks 
about a possible alliance between Shinseito and the current LDP. 
In response, Hata says his party is not thinking of forming any 
alliance with the LDP at present. Yamamoto also asks when the 
second stage for the realignment of the political parties will 
begin. In reply, Hata says: "I think it is certain that a 
movement will gain momentum to that end if the new electoral 
system is introduced." 
  In that context, Yamamoto asks if there is a possibility 
that 
the ruling partners will try to revise the political reform 
bills in a bid to compromise with the LDP. Hata says: "As I 
said earlier, the Diet is a venue for debate, and the political 
reform bills in question are designed to establish the 
foundation for democracy. It is not desirable for the coalition 
government to insist on keeping the bills intact. But if both 
ruling and opposition parties engage in genuine discussions, it 
would be possible to come to some conclusions. So, if all the 
parties give up pursuing their own party interests or individual 
interests, I think it is possible to find a way for 
discussions." He then discusses the significance of carrying 
out political reform. Yamamoto then asks if Prime Minister 
Hosokawa should take responsibility if the political reform is 
not carried out. Hata answers "I wonder if we are qualified to 
hold Prime Minister Hosokawa responsible. The people would call 
on each of Diet member to take responsibility instead," saying: 
"Prime Minister Hosokawa is seriously coming to grips with 
political reform." He then says if he fails to carry out the 
political reform, the responsibility rests with the opposition 
parties and some of the coalition partners. 
  Asked by Yamamoto about the possibility of dissolving the 
House of Representatives, Hata says the dissolution of the House 
of Representatives could be one path, but he adds: "Now the 
government faces economic issues and many other problems to be 
resolved immediately. Therefore, we cannot dissolve the House 
of Representatives." 
  Asked by Yamada if the government's economic affairs 
consultation council chaired by Hata will come up with concrete 
measures to stimulate the economy, Hata says in-depth 
discussions will be held to work out concrete stimulus measures. 
On the issue of raising the consumption tax to make up for a 
fiscal revenue shortfall resulting from cuts in the income tax 
cut, Hata says it is difficult to raise the consumption tax 
simultaneously with the income tax cut and notes the immediate 
issuance of deficit-covering bonds is also difficult. 
  Asked by Yamamoto when the budget for fiscal 1994 will be 
compiled, Hata indicates the hope that debate on a budget bill 
will begin in early February, stressing significance of the 
budget. The interview with Hata ends at 0000 GMT. 
  At 0001 GMT, Yamamoto begins an interview with Komeito's 
Ishida. Yamamoto first asks if the political reform bills can be 
passed in the House of Councillors during the current Diet 
session. Ishida says: "The deliberation of the political reform 
bills will resume in the House of Councillors on 4 and 5 
January. But I think the situation is still grim. When I come 
to think about it, we have spent five years dealing with this 
issue. Since the political reform bills were adopted at the 
House of Representatives at the end of the debate, I strongly 
hope that the coalition partners will draw a lesson while 
seeking cooperation from the opposition parties." Asked by 
Yamada to what extent the coalition partners can compromise with 
the opposition parties, Ishida says: "Taking into consideration 
the fact that fierce discussions were held between the ruling 
and opposition parties on possible revision of the bills, I do 
not think we need to further change the bills." He then briefly 
explains the major points of differences between the ruling and 
opposition parties on the political reform bills. 
  Asked by Yamamoto if Prime Minister Hosokawa should take 
responsibility if he fails to get the bills passed in the Diet, 
Ishida says: "I think he is somewhat responsible for it. But I 
do not think his failure in passing the bills will lead to the 
dissolution of the House of Representatives or resignation of 
the cabinet en masse." He says "The responsibility also rests 
with both the ruling and the opposition parties," adding: "I do 
not think the prime minister alone should be held responsible." 
  Asked about the Komeito's policy conflict with the SDPJ, 
Ishida says it is nothing to worry about. He then discusses 
Komeito's relations with Shinseito, saying Shinseito's members' 
opinions are worth paying attention to because they have 
experience in running the government as LDP members. But he 
rules out the possibility of forming a new party with Shinseito 
in the near future. 
  On controversial relations between the Komeito and the Sokka 
Gakkai, a Buddhist sect, which LDP member Watanabe views as 
running counter to the principle of separating religion from 
politics, Ishida says he intends to work for more transparency 
in relations between the Komeito and the Soka Gakkai. 
  Asked about his view on plans by the Finance Ministry and 
the 
Tax Reform Council to raise the consumption tax and cut the 
income tax simultaneously, Ishida says: "There is an opinion 
that the effect of the income tax cut would be offset by the 
hike in the consumption tax. I do not think we should ignore 
this opinion. In this sense, even if the government decides to 
cut the income tax, deficit-covering bonds should be issued as 
fiscal revenue source. The government should not decide to 
raise the consumption tax until in-depth discussions are held." 
The interview with Komeito Chairman Ishida ends at 0020 GMT. 
  At 0021 GMT, Yamamoto begins an interview with Ouchi. Asked 
by interviewer Yamada about the possibility of passing the 
political reform bills in the Diet during its current session, 
Ouchi says: "Our party will do its utmost to have the political 
reform bills passed. The duration of the current Diet was 
extended for 45 days. We have enough time to debate this issue. 
I think we can pass the bills after making thorough debates 
unless there is vicious obstruction to the debates." Asked 
about a possible compromise with the LDP, Ouchi says the 
coalition partners and the government have to make efforts to 
have the bills passed even by compromising with the LDP. 
  Noting the LDP is maintaining that the stimulus measures 
be placed ahead of political reform, Yamamoto asks Ouchi to 
comment on this. Ouchi points out the Hosokawa government was 
inaugurated after pledging to push for political reform and 
stresses "the need for the Hosokawa government to push for 
political reform to maintain a relationship of trust with the 
people," adding that the coalition government should not abandon 
or delay the stimulus measures. Ouchi also regrets the 
"government's decision to defer the compilation of a budget for 
fiscal 1994 to this year." Ouchi adds, "It is important for the 
coalition partners to work together to reassure the people of 
the prospect of an early economic recovery by unveiling the 
outline of the 1994 budget." 
  Asked by Yamamoto about the possibility of dissolving the 
House of Representatives if the political reform bills fail to 
pass in the Diet, Ouchi rules out the possibility and stresses 
the "coalition partners should do their utmost to pass the 
political reform bills in the Diet." Asked by Yamamoto about 
Prime Minister Hosokawa's political responsibility if the 
political reform bills are not passed in the Diet, Ouchi notes 
that Mr. Hosokawa recently apologized for his failure to pass 
them and made clear that he would take political responsibility. 
Ouchi makes it clear that "Mr. Hosokawa should take political 
responsibility one way or another if the bills fail to pass in 
the Diet." 
  Asked by Yamada about the economic outlook, Ouchi admits 
that 
"the more than 3 trillion yen stimulus measures have thus far 
failed to generate the desired effect of stimulating the 
economy" and stresses the "need for the coalition government to 
compile a third supplementary budget with the aim of helping the 
economy recover this summer." Ouchi also stresses "the need for 
the coalition government to seek bold tax cuts, and a policy to 
spur land and housing transactions, and overhaul the current 
monetary system." Discussing ways to cut taxes, Ouchi contends 
that income tax cuts and the consumption tax hike should be 
treated separately. Discussing the income tax cut, Ouchi says 
the ruling parties and the coalition government have yet to 
decide on it and says his view is that at least 0.6 trillion yen 
should be cut from taxes to spur the stagnant economy, and 
deficit-covering bonds should not be issued. Discussing the 
realignment of the political parties, Ouchi says political 
parties that share the same policies should form a new party, 
and adds that "once the political reform bills are passed in the 
Diet, the political parties will immediately move 
behind-the-scenes toward a realignment." The interview with 
Ouchi ends at 0037 GMT. 
  At 0038 GMT, Yamamoto begins an interview with Takemura by 
pointing to a recent fall in the popular approval rating of the 
Hosokawa government. In response, Takemura concedes that the 
rating has fallen in the wake of the coalition government's 
decision to accept the GATT compromise proposal calling for a 
partial opening of the Japanese rice market, and adds the 
coalition government will work hard to regain popular support. 
Asked by Yamamoto about the personal relationship between 
Takemura and Ozawa, Takemura says: "Mr. Ozawa and I have often 
met for discussions of major political issues. Mr. Ozawa is a 
reformist politician. Mr. Ozawa and I are of almost the same 
view on reform programs including political and administrative 
reforms." He says there are some differences between them on 
how to carry out the reform programs. 
  Asked by Yamamoto about an alleged policy rift between the 
SDPJ and Shinseito, Takemura says he does not take this 
seriously, but admits the "existence of a sense of incongruity 
among the coalition partners." Takemura says the "SDPJ has a 
different security policy from the rest of the coalition 
partners." Takemura also says the "SDPJ has been working hard 
in the coalition government while making difficult decisions." 
Asked by Yamada if the political reform bills will be passed 
without fail in the Diet during its current session, Takemura 
says: "We are trying hard to pass them during the current Diet 
session. It was regrettable to fail to pass them in the Diet 
within 1993. I feel sorry for that. I intend to work hard to 
pass them in the House of Councillors." Discussing Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's political responsibility if the bills fail 
to pass in the Diet, Takemura says: "Prime Minister Hosokawa 
has repeatedly pledged to work for their passage with a firm 
resolve. The prime minister and I intend to do our utmost to 
pass them during the current Diet session." 
  Discussing the possibility of revising the political 
reform bills under deliberation in the House of Councillors, 
Takemura says: "Both ruling and opposition parties are closer 
to agreeing on the revision. If they make minor concessions to 
each other, they will find areas of agreement." Discussing the 
possibility of dissolving the House of Representatives, Takemura 
rules out this possibility and stresses the need for the 
coalition partners to resolve many thorny issues one by one 
while shoring up the coalition government. Discussing the 
stimulus measures, Takemura regrets the deferment of the 
compilation of the 1994 budget and reveals that "the coalition 
government intends to use all fiscal and monetary means to 
tackle the worst post-war recession while upholding the 
principle of compiling an unprecedentedly bold third 
supplementary budget to spur the economy." 
  With regard to income tax reduction, Takemura says: "The 
coalition government intends to make a final decision on the 
size of the reduction. The prime minister is prepared to do 
so." Discussing the consumption tax hike, Takemura says he 
thinks the coalition government should make a decision on it 
after studying public opinion. Takemura also says the coalition 
government should avoid issuing deficit-covering bonds. 
  Asked by Yamamoto about prospects for a realignment of the 
political parties, Takemura says "it is desirable that political 
parties sharing the same policies and political beliefs forge a 
coalition to seize power, and a second realignment of the 
political parties will surely take place after the next 
elections." Asked by Yamamoto about the merger of Shinseito and 
Sakigake, Takemura says "there is no change in their plans to 
merge themselves and I intend to start talks with Shinseito on 
the merger in the near future." The interview with Takemura ends 
at 0052 GMT. 
  At 0053 GMT, Yamamoto begins interviews with Eda and 
Hosokawa. Eda says the United Socialist Party will play a key 
role in the realignment of the political parties. Commenting on 
the realignment, Eda says the LDP still has a powerful electoral 
base in the countryside and stresses "the need to ask voters in 
the next election whether they want to keep the Hosokawa 
government in place or put the LDP back in power." He adds the 
coalition partners should unite in the next election. 
  Asked by Yamamoto to comment on a stalemate in the 
deliberations of the political reform bills in the House of 
Councillors, Hoshikawa says: "I believe that since the Hosokawa 
government has staked its fate on the passage of the political 
reform bills in the Diet, the bills should be passed in the Diet 
at all costs." Discussing the realignment of the political 
parties, Hoshikawa says he supports forming a multiparty 
government to counter the LDP. 
  The series of interviews with heads of the ruling parties 
end 
at 0058 GMT.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in 
Japanese at 2130 GMT on 1 January 94, as part of its special New 
Year "News 2001" program, carries a live 90-minute discussion on 
political and economic issues. In the program moderated by 
newscasters Yuji Kuroiwa and Yuko Ando, guest commentators 
Kenichi Takemura, columnist, and Yoshiaki Kobayashi, professor 
of Keio University, take part at the FNN studio; five others 
join the discussion through remote hookups: Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata, Kochi Prefecture Governor Daijiro Hashimoto, 
businessman Yasuyuki Nanbu in New York City, writer Yasutaka 
Tsutsui, and writer Yoshimi Ishikawa. 
  Most of the first 70 minutes of the program is devoted to 
discussions on such subjects as Japan's politics, education, and 
freedom of speech in general. 
  At 2240 GMT, newscasters turn to Foreign Minister Hata and 
ask him questions about the political situation. Kuroiwa asks 
the foreign minister what kind of year 1994 will be as far as 
politics is concerned. Minister Hata says: "We must make this 
year a year when politics will go forward and not backward, and 
a year when we can make proposals internationally." 
  Kuroiwa brings up the political reform issue, and asks Hata, 
who is president of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party): "Will the 
current Diet enact the political reform bills?... Please tell 
us about the outlook of the bills getting passed." 
  Hata replies: "Some people predict it will be difficult. 
But public opinion shows that if the politicians, blinded by 
their own interests, fail to pass the bills again this time -- 
no one will trust what the politicians say in the future. I 
think the Diet members have come to realize that too." 
  Kuroiwa notes that the economic recession remains another 
big 
issue, and asks for Hata's comment. Hata responds: "That issue 
can be dealt with at the same time the political reform issue is 
taken care of. We have a minister in charge of political 
reform. Mr. Yamahana is that minister. He heads the Political 
Reform Committee. It can take care of the matter, while other 
people can take care of the economic issues. And that is 
actually what they are doing. Some people talk as if everybody 
were running around busy with the political reform issue, 
neglecting the economic issues. Reality is nothing like that." 
  Newscaster Kuroiwa reminds Hata that Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa had pledged to carry out political reform by the end of 
1993 and had to apologize when that was not done and that 
Hosokawa then pledged that the reform will be carried out before 
the current Diet session ends. Kuroiwa asks Hata: "If the 
bills do not get passed again, will that mean the Diet will be 
dissolved?" 
  Hata answers: "We cannot just dissolve the Diet because we 
have many things to do now. On the contrary, however, it is 
possible, if we make serious mistakes, that the people may start 
demanding that we dissolve the Diet, calling for election system 
reform." 
  Citing the recent election in Russia as an example of rapid 
reform, Takemura points out that it takes time to make changes 
in Japan. Hata responds: "I agree. It seems that the Japanese 
people do not have enough courage to make changes." He adds: 
"Nearly 50 years have passed since the end of World War II and 
there are many things which are outdated in our society." He 
then explains the need to change some outdated rules and systems. 
  Ishikawa says Japan cannot make changes without pressure 
from 
other countries (gaiatsu). Hata says: "Mr. Ishikawa is quite 
right. Unfortunately, everything started to move in the past 
because of other countries." 
  Kuroiwa asks Hata if he is willing to become Japan's next 
leader. Hata answers by saying: "As I have been doing, I will 
continue to exert all-out efforts to support the Hosokawa 
administration, which we created." 
  The discussion on political reforms ends at 2251 GMT, and 
the 
whole program ends by asking all the participants to give their 
views on what the Japanese should do in the future.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 1 KYODO -- The year 1994 will be busy 
for Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko with preparations 
proceeding for the couple's visits to the United States and 
Europe, the first attempt by a Japanese monarch to travel 
overseas twice in one year. 
  In mid-June, the emperor and the empress are expected to 
travel to the U.S., where they will visit eastern, southern and 
western cities. They also plan to make a stopover in Hawaii 
during the journey, official sources said. 
  Preparations are also under way for their trip to Britain 
and 
France in autumn, the sources said. 
  It will be the first time that a Japanese emperor will make 
more than one overseas trip in a year, they said. 
  A visit to the Middle East by Crown Prince Naruhito and his 
wife, Princess Masako, is also being considered, the first 
overseas trip by the couple since they got married last June, 
the sources said. 
  Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko spends [as received] the 
New Year's Day at a newly constructed residence within the 
Imperial Palace compound in central Tokyo. 
  On the opening of the New Year, the emperor said in a 
statement that he hopes disaster-stricken people will be able to 
stand firmly on their feet as quickly as possible, saying that 
the past year was full of numerous sufferings. 
  "It is highly regrettable that throughout the world many 
people are still victims of local conflicts," Emperor Akihito 
said in the statement. "On the other hand, it is gratifying to 
note signs of movement in the right direction, as in the case of 
Cambodia." 
  An unusually cool summer hit the already harsh economic 
environment and more than 400 people died or went missing in an 
earthquake and cloudbursts in Japan. 
  On the quake-battered Okushiri Island in Hokkaido, Emperor 
Akihito said in one of his waka [Japanese-style poem], "I am 
sorrowful, to see the smoke wreaths rising, from things burning 
out, 
  There along the island shore, all strewn with broken 
houses." 
  In February, the emperor and the empress will visit Iwo Jima 
and the Ogasawara islands, where the fiercest fighting in World 
War II took place. The imperial couple will make the visit to 
the islets in the Pacific Ocean, far south of Tokyo, to mark the 
25th anniversary of their return by the United States in 1969, 
Imperial Household Agency officials said. 
  Empress Michiko expressed her joy in her waka at her eldest 
son's marriage to Masako Owada, a former career diplomat. 
  "Hand in hand, may you climb together, 
  The mountain, which, now green with foliage, must be 
garmented in serene beauty," her waka said. 
  Empress Michiko, who collapsed on her 59th birthday last 
October 20 and suffered speech impairment, has partially 
recovered her ability to speak, and her condition is slowly 
getting better, doctors said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 31 KYODO -- General contractor Obayashi 
Corp. paid then Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii 10 million yen in July 
last year in connection with construction work for a waste 
incineration plant, sources said Friday. Obayashi, Japan's 
fourth-largest construction firm, passed on the money through 
timber company President Mitsuo Moriya, 65, a former deputy 
secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party's Miyagi 
prefectural chapter and a close acquaintance of Ishii, the 
sources said. 
  Moriya paid the sum into a bank account he administered for 
Ishii, they said. The money allegedly came from Obayashi's 
branch office for Tohoku, northeastern Japan. 
  According to the sources, Obayashi paid the money in a bid 
to 
have its status in the city's Kuzuoka waste incineration plant 
project upgraded from subcontractor to main contractor for all 
construction works. Plant maker Hitachi Zosen Corp. of Osaka 
was the main contractor for the project, a 29.2 billion yen 
incineration plant for ordinary waste and an 8.2 billion yen 
incinerator for bulk waste. 
  The sources said Obayashi urged Ishii to commission the 
construction work for the bulk-waste incinerator separately from 
the orders placed with Hitachi Zosen, so that Obayashi could 
carry out the work under its company name and reap higher 
profits. In response, Ishii instructed the city administration 
to review the contracts, advocating the separation of 
construction and technological works for the plant, but the 
changes never materialized, the sources said. 
  The incineration plant is scheduled to be completed by 
September 1995. 
  A spokesman for Obayashi's Tokyo headquarters denied that 
the 
company paid bribes to the mayor or ever asked for separated 
orders. Usually orders for waste disposal facilities are placed 
with a plant maker as the main contractor, which commissions 
subcontractors to do the construction work. 
  Ishii is on trial for allegedly taking a total of 130 
million 
yen in bribes from six general contractors including Hazama 
Corp., Shimizu Corp., Taisei Co., and Nishimatsu Construction Co. 
  Moriya has been indicted in a separate bribery case 
involving 
former Miyagi Gov. Shuntaro (?who has been charged) with taking 
a 20 million yen bribe from Taisei in late January.

  [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 31 KYODO -- Five to six incumbent or 
former parliamentarians may come under investigation by 
prosecutors in 1994 in connection with the payment of slush 
funds from major construction firms, investigative sources said 
Friday [31 December]. The investigation into such payments 
rocked Japanese society during the past year. 
  The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office has narrowed 
the 
number of possible suspects to the handful of parliamentarians, 
who had either been cabinet ministers or had exerted influence 
on general contractors and Construction Ministry officials, the 
sources said. 
  Prosecutors are looking into whether those politicians had 
professional authority in connection with the receipt of the 
money, an essential precondition for being able to arrest and 
then indict them, the sources said. 
  Over the past decade of bribery scandals involving 
politicians in Japan, prosecutors faced difficulty in proving 
that they had official authority. In most cases, politicians 
called the money they received "political donations," paid to 
support their political activities. 
  In the past year, prosecutors arrested and subsequently 
indicted two governors, three mayors and a number of executive 
officials of general contractors for bribery in connection with 
prefectural and municipal public works projects. Among the 
businessmen arrested were Takashi Hashimoto, 57, then vice 
president of Taisei Corp., Hiroyuki Koyama, 67, then vice 
president of Shimizu Corp., and Shinji Kiyoyama, 67, then vice 
president of Kajima Corp. 
  Hashimoto was charged with sending 20 million yen each to 
then Miyagi Gov. Shuntaro Honma and then Sendai Mayor Toru 
Ishii, Koyama with giving 10 million yen to then Ibaraki Gov. 
Fujio Takeuchi, and Kiyoyama with supplying Takeuchi 20 million 
yen. The delivery of the money was conducted between December 
1992 and January 1993. 
  These governors, mayors and businessmen all resigned after 
their arrest. Kiyoyama, Koyama and Hashimoto have told 
prosecutors that they provided secret money to politicians. 
  Over the past several years, general contractors have 
reportedly provided 5 million to 10 million yen each in secret 
money to former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, Shinseito 
co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, former Posts and Telecommunication 
Minister Hideo Watanabe and former Construction Minister Kishiro 
Nakamura. These politicians were once highly regarded members 
of the Liberal Democratic Party's construction lobby. 
  Takeshita, who was prime minister between November 1987 and 
June 1989, is currently a conservative independent after he was 
dropped from the LDP list of candidates in the July 18 general 
election for the House of Representatives. He was at the center 
of public criticism for allegedly winning support from an 
underground boss to become LDP president in 1987, a position 
that carried with it the post of prime minister at that time. 
  Ozawa currently is one of the most influential politicians 
as 
the chief political strategist for the coalition government of 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. As the favorite disciple of 
disgraced political power broker Shin Kanemaru, he served as an 
LDP secretary general and acting head of the LDP's largest 
faction headed by Kanemaru. But he parted from the LDP to form 
Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) in June. 
  Watanabe, who was posts and telecommunications minister 
under 
then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for one year starting in 
November 1991, lost his seat in the July general election. 
  Nakamura joined the Miyazawa cabinet as construction 
minister 
in the December 1992 reshuffle. 
  A number of construction scandals have surfaced since 
Kanemaru, a former LDP vice president, was arrested in March on 
suspicion of evading more than 1 billion yen in income tax. The 
arrest came five months after Kanemaru retired from politics. 
  The number of contractor executives and heads of prefectural 
and municipal governments apprehended stands at 29.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 2 KYODO -- Kajima Corp. executives 
promised in 1988 to give 70 million yen to Hideo Watanabe, 
former posts minister, in return for his influence in gaining 
government permission to build a hotel complex in a Tokyo park, 
informed sources said Sunday [2 January]. Kajima Chairman 
Rokuro Ishikawa, 68, Vice Chairman Shoichi Kajima, 63, and 
President Akira Miyazaki, 70, approved the plan to provide the 
unreported "donations," the sources said. At the time, Kajima 
was president and Miyazaki a vice president. 
  Twice annually -- during the summer and year-end gift-giving 
seasons -- 5 million yen was "donated" to Watanabe through the 
Liberal Democratic Party's fund-raising body, Kokumin Seiji 
Kyokai. Altogether, Watanabe received 40 million yen from 
August 1988 through December 1991 in this manner, the sources 
said. 
  The Tokyo district public prosecutors office is probing into 
the matter, sources close to the investigation said. 
  Nippon Television City Corp., a company that owns and leases 
Tokyo Tower's communications facilities to various television 
and radio stations, planned in 1987 to build a high-rise hotel 
project on land lying within Tokyo's Shiba Park. It awarded the 
contract to build the computerized "intelligent building" to 
Kajima. 
  The project was initially regarded as difficult because the 
land lay within the park, where commercial construction is 
severely restricted by the Tokyo metropolitan government to 
protect and preserve urban greenery. 
  However, the Tokyo government issued permission in October 
1988, a few months after the summer of that year when Watanabe 
asked metropolitan authorities to grant a waiver exempting the 
project from the building restrictions. 
  Just prior to that, Watanabe, now 59, had held the post of 
deputy chief cabinet secretary to the Cabinet of then Prime 
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone from July 1986 to November 1987. 
  Watanabe assumed the post of "advisor" to Nippon Television 
City Corp. in May, 1988, five months before the Tokyo government 
approved the Shiba Park high-rise development. 
  Afterwards Watanabe held the position of posts and 
telecommunications minister from November 1991 to December 1992 
under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. 
  Watanabe, a six-term member of the Diet's House of 
Representatives, lost his seat in last July's general election. 
  Payment of the unreported "donations" were suspended when 
the 
project was aborted following the breakdown of contract talks 
between Nippon Television City and a foreign hotel operator that 
had planned to use the building as its Tokyo branch, the sources 
added. 
  Former Kajima Vice President Shinji Kiyoyama and other top 
Kajima executives were arrested last year over the giving of 
bribes to then Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii and Ibaraki Gov. Fujio 
Takeuchi. 
  Ishikawa headed the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
and the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry from December 
1987 until his resignation last August. 
  Kajima Corp., one of Japan's three largest general 
contractors, was also implicated in a bid-rigging scandal 
involving public projects in Saitama Prefecture. In May 1992, 
the Fair Trade Commission ordered the company to stop its 
alleged unfair business practices.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News" </F>
program] 
  [Text] It is expected that full-fledged intracoalition 
discussions on the issue of how to secure sources of revenue to 
make up for a revenue shortfall resulting from the income tax 
cut, which the Hosokawa Government plans as a prop of its 
economic stimulus measures, will begin early in the new year. 
However, there is a growing voice within the ruling parties, 
including in the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], that 
the Finance Ministry-proposed hike in the consumption tax rate 
should not be included in the immediate economic pump-priming 
measures. For that reason, there is a view that the government 
will make a political decision on this issue with emphasis on 
ensuring the unity of the ruling parties. 
  The ruling coalition government is scheduled to resume 
sessions of the economic affairs consultation council, which is 
composed of representatives from each of the ruling parties, 
starting on 5 January in hopes of reaching a certain conclusion 
-- it is hoped by the middle of January -- on the issue of 
cutting the income tax and raising the consumption tax. In this 
connection, the Finance Ministry insists that the decision 
should be made to raise the consumption tax simultaneously with 
the income tax cuts on the grounds that even if the income tax 
cut is carried out before the consumption tax is raised, it is 
necessary to decide in the council session on the timing of 
raising the consumption tax. 
  On the contrary, the SDPJ, the largest party in the ruling 
coalition, is strongly opposed to a hike in the consumption tax, 
saying that sources of revenue should be obtained by issuing 
deficit-covering bonds. In addition, some SDPJ member are 
saying that the party should leave the coalition depending on 
the situation. There is another opinion within the other ruling 
parties that although it is inevitable that there will need to 
be a study of a possible increase in the consumption tax as a 
source of revenue for the future improvement of the welfare 
system, the issue of raising the consumption tax should be 
discussed separately from the issue of the tax cut, which the 
government plans to include in its immediate economic stimulus 
measures. 
  In this way, there are opinions within the ruling parties 
opposing the simultaneous implementation of the tax cut and the 
hike in the consumption tax, and therefore, work for an 
intracoalition coordination of views on this issue is expected 
to be rough sailing. In this sense, a view has also been 
expressed that Prime Minister Hosokawa will make a political 
decision with emphasis on how the deliberation of political 
reform bills -- wherein attention has been focused on the SDPJ's 
move -- will develop and on the unity of the ruling partners.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 3 KYODO -- Two of Japan's major 
business bodies released statements Monday [3 January] calling 
for reforms in the financial sector and achieving stability in 
Japan's financial system to help the country move out of 
recession. 
  The Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai 
Doyukai) urged financial institutions to quit their uniform 
management strategies and rather emphasize their differences. 
  In the banking sector, follow-the-leader psychology has long 
been the norm. 
  The Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) said an 
income tax cut is necessary this year, while stabilizing the 
financial system en route to lifting Japan out of the slumbering 
economy. 
  Analysts say such comments reflect concerns by the business 
community over Japan's financial system and may touch off debate 
about the possible injection of public funds to stabilize 
banking and securities systems. 
  Keizai Doyukai called on business leaders to acknowledge the 
fact that Japan's economy has shifted to one that is led by 
domestic demand and from an export-led economy as seen in the 
era of high growth. 
  The organization went on to say Japan will now have to face 
employment issues and the traditional lifelong employment system 
should be revised to improve labor efficiency.

  [Text] New York, Jan. 2 KYODO -- Yasushi Akashi, new U.N. 
special representative for the former Yugoslavia, has urged 
Japan to take the initiative in strengthening the United 
Nations. In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE before his 
departure on Saturday [1 January] to the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Croatia, Akashi said Japan should not pretend that 
it is indifferent to a proposal to upgrade Japan's standing in 
the world body to that of a permanent member of the U.N. 
Security council. 
  "If Japan were given the status of a Security Council 
permanent member, it needs to act in accordance with its new 
responsibility because the Security Council is responsible for 
ensuring world peace and security," he said. 
  Akashi, who previously headed the U.N. peacekeeping force in 
Cambodia, asked the Japanese to meditate upon the issue of why 
Japan cannot assume a military role in U.N. peacekeeping when 
other countries' peacekeepers are engaged in high-risk fields of 
peacekeeping. "There is a question why Japan failed to send a 
contingent of foot soldiers as peacekeepers despite the fact 
that it could dispatch a contingent of engineering troops to 
Cambodia," he said. 
  "If Japanese people can hammer out a national agreement on 
this matter, I want Japan to send a contingent of foot soldiers 
as peacekeepers," said the U.N. undersecretary general. It is 
the Japanese people who should make a decision whether the 
dispatch of foot soldiers is constitutional or not, he added. 
  Akashi said both the United States and the U.N. became more 
cautious toward peacekeeping following U.N. peacekeepers' 
failure to establish peace in Somalia. 
  The U.S. decided to pull its troops out of the African 
nation 
following their failure to arrest Somali warlord Mohamed Farah 
Aidid. 
  "There occurred tough problems (in Somalia) in such fields 
as 
peacekeepers' command structure, the scope of weapons they are 
allowed to use, as well as the issue of training of peacekeepers 
that participated" from various countries, he said. 
  Akashi referred to the Cambodian experience, where the use 
of 
heavy weapons in dealing with the threat from the "deep-rooted" 
Khmer Rouge would have run the risk of drawing the U.N. 
peacekeepers into a "quagmire." 
  In December, Akashi urged the Japanese Government to send 
peacekeepers to the Balkans region, where civil war has already 
killed an estimated 200,000 people, and has strong potential to 
spread. Then Akashi said he believed Japanese laws "allow" 
Japanese peacekeepers to join the U.N. protection forces 
(UNPROFOR) in the region "in such logistics fields as medical 
service, transportation and communications."

<F P=106> [By William Mallard] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 3 KYODO -- Even some long-time critics 
say Japan's antitrust watchdog seems to be trying out a 
new-found set of fangs, spurred by overseas and domestic 
pressure. But the jury is still out on whether the Fair Trade 
Commission (FTC) has developed a bite to match its bark. 
  With recent high-profile actions against bid-rigging and 
cartels, including last year's first criminal convictions in 17 
years, even adversaries acknowledge progress. 
  "I remember people saying the FTC is a dog that doesn't 
bite," says a U.S. official involved with Japan. "They're 
certainly biting now." But the official quickly sounds 
Washington's undimmed cry -- "the antimonopoly law has to be 
enforced in a stronger way." 
  Indeed, the head of the commission, while highlighting the 
FTC's recently beefed-up powers and repeating his vows to crack 
down harder, stops short of saying the commission's work will 
begin to reduce monopolistic practices in Japan in 1994. 
  "I'd like to hope so. That's my wish," says a grave-faced 
Masami Kogayu, the FTC's chairman. "But I am not optimistic." 
  Despite the commission's recent attention, "there may be 
enterprises or sectors that will not heed the antimonopoly law, 
through misunderstanding or overconfidence," he says, the former 
vice finance minister choosing his words precisely as he sits 
bolt upright in a low-slung chair in his broad, sparse office. 
  In an interview in Tokyo's Kasumigaseki government district 
and briefing Japanese reporters, Kogayu spells out recent FTC 
actions, defends antitrust enforcement and asks observers to 
stay tuned. 
  In mid-December, ruling on an indictment sought by the FTC, 
the Tokyo high court convicted four major printing companies of 
bid-ridding contracts to make peel-off stickers for pension 
notification cards. It fined each company 4 million yen. 
  Seven months earlier, the court found eight makers of 
plastic 
food wrap guilty of price-fixing, fining them 6 million to 8 
million yen each in Japan's first criminal antitrust action 
since a mid-1970s oil cartel case. 
  Although "it's a little bit too early to tell," the two 
cases 
"are probably an indication of a new trend in antitrust 
enforcement by way of criminal enforcement," says trade law 
expert Mitsuo Matsushita, a Tokyo University law professor. 
  Formal actions, including the rare criminal indictments, 
rose 
from seven in fiscal 1989 to 37 in fiscal 1992. Through 
December, the commission took 16 actions in the year starting 
last April but with seasonal disparities the fiscal 1993 count 
may exceed the previous year's, Kogayu says. 
  Japan's antitrust policy, more carrot than stick, "heavily 
relies on a more informal enforcement, guidance and so forth," 
that can mount to some 800 cases in a year, Matsushita says. 
But that's just what irks some foreign companies. 
  "Lack of vigorous application of the antimonopoly law and 
ambiguous explanations by the Fair Trade Commission for pressing 
or not pressing certain cases" block foreign would-be 
competitors unfairly, the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan 
said in its 1993 white paper on trade. 
  "This selective application of antimonopoly statutes is 
often 
seen as preventing full access to Japan's complex distribution 
system," the report says. 
  Washington is asking the FTC to study several business 
sectors, a senior U.S. trade official says, adding U.S. 
proposals in bilateral talks "focus on competition policy and 
enforcement of the antimonopoly act." 
  Kogayu notes that the FTC has vowed to step up indictments. 
Its enforcement of the antimonopoly law, enacted in the wake of 
World War II, "does not stop at just inflicting an extremely 
severe burden on business violators, it is very closely linked 
with a deterrent effect," he says. 
  By far the most common formal action is a warning, 
accompanied by what Kogayu calls a uniquely Japanese enforcement 
tool -- automatic surcharges on the portion of sales that the 
FTC judges to be ill-gotten. In the last two years, the Diet 
has raised the surcharge rate and boosted the maximum fine for 
criminal antimonopoly law violations by 20 times to 100 million 
yen. 
  Critics say an FTC study group watered down its original 
plan 
to recommend even stiffer fines and Kogayu acknowledges that the 
maximum is about one-tenth that under U.S. antitrust law. But 
he stresses the FTC's panoply of fines and surcharges, its 
commitment in principle to supply some documents to plaintiffs 
in civil suits and the effect of bad publicity on offenders. 
  "Evaluated in total, the deterrent effect against violators 
of Japan's antimonopoly law is absolutely not less than that of 
America or Europe," Kogayu says. "I think it is by no means 
inferior." 
  He also points to action on other fronts. Since their 1965 
peak of 1,079, the number of cartels exempted from the 
antimonopoly law has been squeezed to 71 and the FTC is 
requiring the remainder to show proof why they too should not be 
eliminated, Kogayu says. 
  In November, the FTC searched the offices of such leading 
electronics makers as Sony Corp. and Toshiba Corp., seeking 
evidence of bid-rigging for giant video screens. Commission 
investigators also searched Shiseido Co. On suspicion it 
illegally forced retailers not to discount its cosmetics. 
  "Our tools have been strengthened and we have just begun 
using them," Kogayu says. "Please watch our actions. The 
results are now coming out."

  [Text] The United States has begun to adopt a flexible 
attitude on the issue of setting numerical trade targets. A 
senior Foreign Ministry official on 21 December commented on the 
apparent change in the U.S. stance. 
  He said: "It is a feint operation. There is no change in 
the U.S. belief in the importance of trade results. American 
experts and the media have criticized the way the United States 
has pushed for numerical targets as a way of seeking managed 
trade. The United States is probably shying away from using the 
term numerical targets in the face of this criticism." 
  He continued: "The substance of the U.S. policy of attaching 
more importance to trade results than on the market opening 
process, and of pressing Japan to raise the share of foreign 
goods in the Japanese market to levels comparable with the rest 
of the G-7 nations, remains unchanged."

  [Text] Commenting on reports that the United States 
declared in the Japan-U.S. comphrensive economic talks that it 
is not seeking to set numerical targets, a Foreign Ministry 
source on 22 December criticized the United States, saying "the 
United States is calling on Japan to raise foreign products' 
market shares in Japan to the level of their shares in the seven 
industrialized nations (G-7). That is as bad as setting 
numerical targets." 
  The source added that "it was decided in July (at the time 
of 
Japan and the United States agreeing on frameworks) that no 
numerical targets should be set."

  [Text] Washington, Dec. 30 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
United States are to hold a couple more working-level contacts 
in early January and then toss nuclear inspection details over 
to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), sources said 
Thursday. 
  The two sides have not reached a full agreement on access to 
all seven declared nuclear facilities, they said. The tentative 
agreement now is to wrap up the working-level negotiations next 
month and leave the details to talks between North Korea and the 
IAEA. 
  According to State Department spokesman David Johnson, the 
talks are closing in on the goal and there will be another 
contact with North Korea soon. 
  While Johnson reaffirmed that North Korea would have to 
allow 
unrestricted inspection of all seven facilities, sources said 
that though Pyongyang suggested willingness to grant something 
close to a full inspection it certainly did not clearly agree to 
routine inspections. 
  One source said the situation resembles a half-filled cup: 
Some will say it's half full, and others will say it's half 
empty. 
  Washington negotiators decided that this is close enough to 
an agreement for unlimited inspection and accepted the North 
Korean proposal to settle the details directly with the IAEA, 
according to the sources. 
  In their most recent contact, on Wednesday, the United 
States 
and North Korea discussed where North Korea and the IAEA would 
meet and North Korea proposed Pyongyang. 
  U.S. officials opposed the idea because they would rather 
see 
an IAEA inspection go into North Korea after an agreement is 
clearly reached, the sources said. 
  Washington may agree to announce another round of high-level 
talks with Pyongyang and suspension of the South Korea-U.S. 
annual military maneuver "Team Spirit" once an IAEA inspection 
team arrives in Pyongyang and inter-Korean dialogue resumes, 
they said. 
  A roughly drawn timetable includes more working-level talks 
in early January, North Korea-IAEA negotiations in mid-January, 
an IAEA team's arrival in North Korea and inter-Korean dialogue 
in late January, and high-level North Korea-U.S. talks sometime 
in February, the sources said.

  [Text] Seoul, Dec. 31 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, 
in his New Year's Day message, urged the people on Saturday to 
make a brave leap forward to the world and the future in 1994 
while consolidating the reform and change that they achieved in 
the last year. 
  "Let us usher in the new year with an open mind, shedding 
old 
things as we have just bidden farewell to the past," Kim said. 
  "Let us also shed selfishness, deceit, indolence, vanity and 
wastefulness in the New Year and be reborn as a new people. We 
have to make 1994 a new year in which we have to wipe out the 
remaining corruption and irregularities and make ours a new and 
clean society." 
  The president said he wished that everyone would live for 
their community rather than for themselves in the coming year. 
  "We have to demolish all kinds of obstacles within ourselves 
and remold a just society that we can be proud of," the 
president said. "There lies the reason why we cannot delay nor 
stop our reform." 
  1994 must be the year during which "we have to open narrow 
minds and closed doors and take the steps toward the 
competitive, wide world with the confidence born of 
cooperation," he said. 
  He said the coming year has to be the period in which Korea 
not only survives in the new world order of competition but 
raises its status as a nation still further. 
  "A chance never comes twice," Kim declared. "And it is said 
that chance and crisis come together." 
  The president urged the people to grab the opportunity that, 
he said, was being created as a challenge through 
internationalization and openness, referring, among other 
things, to the successful conclusion of the uruguay round of 
trade negotiations under which Korea will open its farm market. 
  "We cannot afford to miss the best opportunity that has come 
our way in a long while," he said. 
  Everyone will have to take up the challenge of competition, 
at work, on the street, at home and in school, Kim said. 
  "None of us should ever forget that we are the main player 
in 
international competition. And we have to win, at any cost," he 
declared. 
  "We cannot afford to waste our precious time by engaging in 
wasteful dissension and enmity," he said. 
  "In order to win the unrestrained competition in 
international arenas, let us concentrate our creativity and 
ability to boost our national strength and organization. We 
have to make 1994 the starting point for reform and progress 
toward the world and the future. We should not cling to 
unproductive arguments but find the right answers in practical 
work." 
  The people had to sort out what was good and beneficial for 
them. Through such practical reform, Kim said, the country can 
solve the problems of farmers and fishermen, who face a severe 
challenge as a result of the market opening for farm imports. 
  "Let us gather our wisdom and strength in order to give hope 
and courage to our farmers," he said. 
  Lastly, the president said, he prayed for genuine peace to 
befall the still divided Korean peninsula through a resolution 
of the North Korean nuclear question this year. 
  "Let us work together to make 1994 a year in which Koreans 
living in the North can take part in the worldwide trend of 
reform and openness as well as in our people's historical 
mission to create a new Korea," he said.

<F P=106> ["New Year address" by Kim Il-song, general secretary of the </F>
WPK Central Committee and DPRK president, at a joint meeting of 
the WPK Central Committee, the DPRK Central People's Committee, 
and the Administration Council in the grand conference room of 
the Kumsusan Assembly Hall on 31 December 1993--recorded] 
  [Text] [Applause] Dear comrades, compatriots, and 
brothers and sisters: Today, we are ringing out 1993, which is 
brilliant with heroic struggles and feats, and ringing in the 
new year, 1994, filled with confidence and optimism. [applause] 
  In greeting the New Year, I extend warm congratulations and 
warm greetings to all the people, including our working class, 
cooperative peasants, intellectuals, and People's Army officers 
and men, who, with boundless loyalty to the party and the leader 
[suryong], are devotedly waging the struggle for the 
chuche-oriented socialist cause. [applause] 
  I extend warm congratulations and compatriotic greetings to 
brothers and sisters in South Korea and Korean residents in 
Japan and all the other compatriots overseas who are positively 
waging the struggle to peacefully reunify the fatherland. 
[applause] 
  I extend New Year greetings to the progressive peoples and 
friends on the five continents who treasure justice and peace 
and aspire for an independent new world. [applause] 
  The year 1993 was a historic year when the justness of our 
party's independent revolutionary lines and the might of chuche 
Korea were displayed powerfully. [applause] 
  Last year, the imperialists and reactionaries more viciously 
than ever maneuvered to isolate and stifle [korip chilsik] our 
Republic and obliterate [malsal] our socialist cause. As a 
result, the situation in our country has become very tense. 
  When a stern trial faced the fatherland and revolution, our 
party, in response to the prevailing situation, took the bold 
self-defensive measure of declaring a state of semi-war in the 
entire country, all the people, and the entire Army and called 
on all the people to break through head-on [matpadanagamyo] the 
enemy's challenge with the revolutionary spirit and militant 
spirit -- which was displayed during the period of the stern 
fatherland liberation war -- and score great upsurges in 
socialist construction. 
  Our heroic People's Army officers and men and all the 
people, 
who accepted the party's militant call with their hearts, rose 
up like one in the struggle to defend national independence and 
the revolutionary feats with confidence in a sure victory and 
soaring spirits, crushed the enemy's challenge and aggression 
maneuvers, and honorably defended the dignity and safety of the 
socialist fatherland, thus fully displaying the indomitable 
spirit of chuche Korea. [applause] 
  This is the victory of our party's revolutionary lines and 
the great victory of single-minded unity among the leader 
[suryong], party, and masses. [applause] 
  Last year our people, under the leadership of the party, 
attained successive victories in the political and military 
confrontation with the enemies. With high revolutionary zeal, 
they vigorously accelerated the socialist economic construction 
and brilliantly concluded the final year of the Third Seven-Year 
Plan. [applause] 
  During the Third Seven-Year Plan period, we came up against 
considerable difficulty and obstacle in the economic 
construction owing to the unexpected international events and 
the acute situation created in the country, but we have made 
great progress in all fields of socialist economic construction. 
Our independent industry made significant expansion in the 
overall production capacity, the standard of its technology and 
equipment was enhanced much, and its structure by sectors 
further reinforced, thereby its self-reliance and might was 
further strengthened. 
  In the rural economic sector, the great nature-remaking 
project of completing irrigation at a higher level was 
victoriously conducted and an upturn was brought forth in 
mechanization and scientization. With the further development 
of agricultural science and technology in conformity with the 
chuche agricultural method, we built a solid revolutionary 
agricultural foundation ensuring a continuous bumper crop. 
  According to our party's idea of capital construction, the 
magnificent and splendid Kwangbok Street, Tongil Street, the 
Fatherland Liberation War Victory Monument, the Three 
Revolutions Exhibition Center, the May Day Stadium, and numerous 
other monumental creations were built during the Third 
Seven-Year Plan period. This intensively demonstrates the might 
of the inexhaustible creativity and our country's self-reliant 
national economy. It clearly symbolizes the heroic spirit of 
socialist Korea which victoriously advances undisturbed by the 
worldwide economic recession. [applause] 
  Despite today's complicated situation, our people are all 
enjoying rewarding, happy lives free from social and political 
unrest or worries about livelihood under the popular 
mass-centered socialist system of our country. The communist 
virtues, in which the people help and encourage each other--one 
for all and all for one--sharing joy and sorrow, prevail more 
beautifully in the entire society. 
  Through a stern trial and struggle in recent times, we 
strongly demonstrated once again that our party is a great party 
of iron-will and tested guidance, that our people are a heroic 
people of firm revolutionary faith and indomitable struggle 
spirit, and that our-style socialism embodying the chuche idea 
is an indestructible socialism taking root deep among the 
popular masses. [applause] 
  I warmly thank all the people--including our workers, 
farmers, intellectuals, and the soldiers of the People's 
Army--for the shining exploits they have accomplished in the 
revolution and construction last year under the party's 
leadership. [applause] 
  The New Year of 1994 is a year of revolutionary upturn when 
our country's socialist construction enters a new developmental 
stage and a year of rewarding struggle when the entire party 
membership, the entire country, and all the people should be 
totally mobilized to effect revolutionary upsurge in all fronts. 
  The situation at home and abroad of our revolution is still 
complicated and strained, and we are building socialism in acute 
confrontation with the enemies. In conformity with today's 
situation and the demand of our revolution's development, we 
must thoroughly implement the independent, self-reliant, and 
self-defending revolutionary line and vigorously conduct the 
three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--so 
that we may further strengthen the country's political, 
economic, and military might. 
  We must solidify and develop the successes we have already 
attained in socialist construction and win new greater victories 
so that we may add luster to the popular mass-centered socialism 
of our own style and hold further aloft the chuche socialist 
banner. [applause] 
  We should consider the next three years to be an adjustment 
period for the socialist economic construction as decided at the 
21st plenary session of the sixth party Central Committee. We 
should thoroughly implement a policy of top priority for 
agriculture, light industry, and trade during this period. 
  Along with this, we should firmly give priority to 
developing 
the coal and electric power industries and railway 
transportation, which are primary sectors in the national 
economy. We should constantly develop the metal industry. By 
thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary strategies 
during the adjustment period for the socialist econonomic 
construction, we should consolidate as firm as a rock the 
self-reliant economic foundation of the country, should more 
smoothly ensure the people's lives in keeping with the socialist 
demand, and should secure a new position of attack to reach a 
higher target of socialism. [applause] 
  This year, we should concentrate our strength on developing 
agriculture, the light industry, and foreign trade. This year 
is a significant year. It marks the 30th anniversary of the 
publication of the socialist rural theses. We should effect a 
new turn in developing the rural economy by vigorously 
struggling to implement the historic task of the rural theses. 
We should further develop all fields of agricultural 
production, including the production of grains, by consolidating 
the successes of irrigation and electrification in the rural 
areas, realizing the mechanization and widespread use of 
chemicals at a higher level, and by thoroughly carrying out the 
chuche-oriented farming method in the rural areas. 
  Our working class should produce more tractors, automobiles, 
modern agricultural farming instruments, chemical fertilizers, 
and farming medicines, and send them to rural villages. With 
the attitude befitting the masters responsible for the national 
granary, the people working in agricultural cooperatives and all 
the people working in agriculture should conduct all farming 
work carefully and frugally and realize the high target of grain 
production provided by the party. [applause] 
  We should make a great innovation in producing people's 
consumer goods by vigorously accelerating the light industry 
revolution. We should repair, supplement, and modernize light 
industry plants. We should take a positive measure to 
strengthen the production of light industry raw materials, such 
as chemical fibers and plastics. By so doing, we should operate 
all light industry plants at full capacity and normalize 
production at a higher level. 
  Ranging the large-scale central light industry from small- 
and medium-sized local industries and the production of 3 August 
people's consumer goods, all units and domains should fully 
produce various people's consumer goods. By so doing, we should 
increase the types of consumer goods and actually improve their 
quality. 
  We should positively pioneer foreign markets and thoroughly 
win our reputation in developing foreign trade in keeping with 
the changing circumstances. Various domains of the national 
economy should thoroughly strengthen the production bases for 
export goods, increase production of export goods, and improve 
their quality. 
  All domains and all locals should further increase export by 
positively finding and mobilizing the sources of export. They 
should also develop the processing trade. 
  We should put efforts into the coal, electrict power, and 
metal industries in a bid to develop agriculture and the light 
industry and vigorously accelerate the overall economic 
construction of the country. We should more smoothly resolve 
the railway transportation issue. The fields of coal and 
electric power industries should effectively use existing 
production foundations and further develop the production 
capacity. They thereby should decisively increase the 
production of coal and electricity. We should smoothly meet the 
daily-increasing demand for transportation of the national 
economy by strengthening the railroad's material and 
technological foundation, setting up a policy for 
transportation, commanding the transportation organization, and 
actively making the railways strong. 
  All units and domains of the national economy should 
vigorously launch the campaign for the struggle for production 
and conservation as an all-people movement. By so doing, they 
should effectively use existing labor, facilities, and 
equipment, and should fully mobilize inner reserves and increase 
production. 
  All the economic guidance officials must carry out economic 
organizational work and production management to comply with the 
party's economic strategies, have the popular masses display 
their revolutionary enthusiasm and positive creativity, and, 
thus overfull the people's economic plan for this year. 
  Contributing to socialist construction with scientific 
knowledge and technology is our intellectuals' honorable duty. 
In hearty response to the party's policy on cultural 
revolution, intellectuals must devotedly wage the struggle to 
achieve new development in science, education, culture and arts, 
public health, and all other fields of socialist cultural 
construction. 
  This year we must also cope with the enemy's war provocation 
maneuvers and make proper efforts to strengthen the country's 
defense capability. We must firmly prepare ourselves 
politically, ideologically, militarily, and materially so that 
we may confidently cope with any unexpected development, and 
thoroughly establish the environment in the entire society of 
regarding military affairs [kunsa] as important and actively 
assisting the People's Army. [applause] 
  To vigorously push ahead with revolution and construction 
under today's circumstances, we must strongly adhere to our 
party's policy on ideological revolution, further strengthen 
single-minded unity in the revolutionary ranks, and highly 
demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. 
Single-minded unity and self-reliance are the immortal, 
honorable traditions of our revolution and the banners of 
victory. [applause] 
  We have opened the road of brilliant victory after 
overcoming 
stern trials with the might of single-minded unity and made 
great progress in revolution and construction while overcoming 
all difficulties with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. 
  When all the people fight vigorously by being 
single-mindedly 
united around the party and the leader [suryong] and highly 
demonstrating the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
arduous struggle, can we defend and maintain the socialism of 
our own style and boundlessly glorify it and victoriously 
complete the chuche-oriented socialist cause no matter the trial 
we may face. [applause] 
  We must defend single-minded unity in our revolutionary 
ranks, which has been consolidated like a rock under our party's 
leadership, as the most precious and further consolidate and 
develop it. 
  We must break through difficulties at hand and score new 
upsurges in socialist construction by more highly displaying the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle. 
  "Let us vigorously accelerate the grand socialist onward 
march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous 
struggle!" This is the call of our party today and a militant 
slogan that our people must uphold. [applause] 
  In hearty response to the party's militant call, all the 
officials, party members, and workers must continue their 
innovation and advance in the spirit of Chollima spurred on by 
the speed of the nineties and, thus, make the New Year, 1994, a 
historic year of turns in revolution and construction in our 
country. [applause] 
  The fatherland's reunification is a foremost national task 
to 
our people that cannot be delayed even for a moment. We must 
achieve the cause of the fatherland's reunification at the 
earliest possible date, and thus, fulfill all the fellow 
countrymen's unanimous earnest desire and hand the reunified 
fatherland over to the posterity. [applause] 
  Our party and the Republic Government put forward the 
10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for 
reunification of the country in a bid to lay a foundation for 
national reunification through the united national strength last 
year and has made all efforts to realize the 10-point program. 
  Our 10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for 
reunification of the country reflects the 70 million fellow 
countrymen's noble desire to firmly unite all people as one by 
transcending the difference in ideology, ideas, and systems and 
to achieve the reunification and prosperity of our nation who 
has the long history of half a century. 
  We wanted the South Korean authorities to come out to the 
road of reconciliation and cooperation by responding to our 
10-point program of great unity of the whole nation for 
reunification of the country. We also took the important measure 
for exchanging special envoys of the two sides' top leaders. 
However, the South Korean authorities have ignored our 
magnanimous proposals and all the people's desire for 
reunification. They have taken the road of depending upon 
foreign forces, not the road of national independence; they have 
taken the road to the North-South confrontation, not the road to 
national unity. 
  While frequently conducting large-scale military exercises 
against our Republic, in collusion with outside forces and 
talking about military countermeasures [kunsajok taeung] or an 
international cooperation system under the pretext of our 
nuclear issue, the South Korean authorities are leading 
North-South relations to a dangerous phase. 
  The so-called South Korean civilian regime is only so in 
appearance [houl ppunida], and is actually not different from 
the preceding military dictatorial regime. Anticommunist and 
fascist evil laws have remained as they are in South Korea. The 
South Korean people's desire for independence, democracy, and 
national reunification have not been realized. The South Korean 
people and figures of all strata are saying that they no longer 
have any further expectations of the current South Korean 
regime. This is natural. 
  If I speak of our nuclear issue, which the United States and 
its followers are babbling about, it is because of the 
antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuver which the United States 
has persistently sought. 
  It is the United States that raised the nonexistent nuclear 
issue and brought the nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula 
in actuality, thus threatening us. Therefore, the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula must be resolved through DPRK-U.S. 
talks. Pressure and threat cannot work on us. If the United 
States adheres to such methods, it cannot resolve the issue and 
may drive the situation to a catastrophe [paguk]. The United 
States should look straight at all facts and act with discretion. 
  Under the circumstances in which the DPRK-U.S. joint 
statement was adopted, if the two sides abide by and implement 
the principles which were already reached, the nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula can be impartially resolved. 
  There is no change in the principle and line of our party 
and 
the Republic Government for national reunification. We will 
make all efforts to achieve the national reunification by means 
of a confederation based on one nation, one state, two systems, 
and two governments according to the three-point principles of 
independence, peaceful reunification, and the great national 
unity. 
  The destiny of the fatherland is the destiny of the nation 
and the destiny of all our compatriots at home and abroad. All 
the Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas 
should be united and wage a pannational struggle under the 
banner of great unity of the whole nation in order to open a new 
phase for national reunification this year. [applause] 
  Although the imperialists are raving about the end of 
socialism in the international arena, indulging in bravado and 
bluster, they cannot block the people's aspiration for 
independence and socialism, nor can they reverse the trend of 
history. If the world's progressive people strengthen unity and 
solidarity under the anti-imperialist banner for independence 
and actively push forward the trend of history, they will 
certainly expedite mankind's bright future. [applause] 
  Our party and the government of the Republic will 
consistently implement the external policy of independence, 
peace, and friendship in conformity with the demand of the 
present situation. We will make active efforts to maintain 
unity with socialist and nonaligned countries on the principle 
of independence. We will also develop good neighborly and 
friendly relations with capitalist countries which respect our 
country's sovereignty. [applause] 
  The government of our Republic will destroy the old 
international political and economic order of domination and 
subjugation, establish new international political and economic 
order based on equality, justice, and fairness, and make active 
efforts to develop South-South cooperation on the principle of 
collective self-reliance. 
  Our people's struggle today is arduous, but it is an 
honorable and sacred struggle for the growth and prosperity of 
our fatherland and for the future of mankind. Ever-victorious 
are our people who struggle for the just cause under the great 
party's leadership. [applause] 
  Let us all firmly unite around the party Central Committee 
under the banner of the chuche idea and wage a vigorous struggle 
to win new victory in socialist construction and to expedite the 
independent and peaceful reunification of the country. [applause]

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 1 (KCNA) -- A joint meeting of 
the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, the 
Central People's Committee and the Administration Council of the 
DPRK was held at the Grand Conference Room of the Kumsusan 
Assembly Hall on December 31, 1993. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, general secretary of 
the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and 
president of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, 
delivered a New Year address at the joint meeting. 
  His New Year address reads in full: 
  Dear comrades, compatriots, brothers and sisters, 
  Today we are ringing out 1993, a brilliant year which has 
been marked with a heroic struggle and great exploits, and 
ringing in a new year 1994, full of confidence and optimism. 
  On the occasion of the new year, I extend warm 
congratulations and fervent greetings to our working class, 
cooperative farmers, intellectuals, officers and men of the 
People's Army, and all the other people who have been working 
hard with devotion for the socialist cause of chuche, with 
unfailing loyalty to the party and the revolution. 
  My warm congratulations and compatriotic greetings also go 
to 
our brothers in the South, our fellow Koreans in Japan, and all 
the other Koreans abroad who have been striving for the peaceful 
reunification of the country. 
  I also extend my new year greetings to the progressive 
people 
and our friends on the five continents who value justice and 
peace and are advancing towards a new world of independence. 
  1993 was a historic year which powerfully demonstrated the 
validity of our party's revolutionary line of independence and 
the might of chuche Korea. 
  Last year the imperialists and reactionaries worked more 
malignantly than ever to isolate and stifle our Republic and 
crush our cause of socialism. As a result, the situation in our 
country became extremely tense. When the country and the 
revolution were faced with a stern trial, our party took 
resolute self-defensive measures by declaring the state of 
semi-war for the whole country, all the people and the entire 
Army in order to cope with the prevailing situation. It called 
on all the people to meet the enemy's challenge and bring about 
a great upsurge in socialist construction in the same 
revolutionary spirit and militant stamina as they had displayed 
during the years of the grim fatherland liberation war. 
  The officers and men of our heroic People's Army and all the 
people, in hearty response to the party's militant call, stood 
up as one man in the struggle to defend the country's 
sovereignty and revolutionary achievements with an unshakable 
confidence in victory and in soaring spirits, foiled the enemy's 
challenge and aggressive scheme and honourably safeguarded the 
dignity and security of their socialist motherland. Thus they 
fully demonstrated the unbreakable spirit of chuche Korea. This 
means the victory of our party's revolutionary line, a great 
victory of the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party and 
the masses. 
  Last year, while achieving one victory after another under 
the party's leadership in the political and military 
confrontation with the enemy, our people brilliantly adorned the 
last year of the Third Seven-Year Plan by accelerating the 
construction of the socialist economy with great revolutionary 
enthusiasm. During the Third Seven-Year Plan we made long 
strides in all fields of socialist economic construction in 
spite of the enormous difficulties and obstacles caused in 
economic construction by unexpected international events and the 
tension in our country. 
  The production capacity of our chuche-orientated industry 
has 
been considerably expanded as a whole, the level of its 
technical equipment greatly raised and the structure of its 
branches has been improved still more, thus further increasing 
its independence and capabilities. In agriculture grand 
nature-harnessing projects to complete irrigation on a high 
level have been carried out victoriously, a great advance made 
in its mechanization and in the application of chemicals, and 
agricultural science and technology have developed still further 
in keeping with the requirements of the chuche farming method, 
with the result that a solid foundation of agricultural 
production has been laid to ensure a bumper crop every year. 
Numerous monumental creations such as magnificent and splendid 
Kwangbok and Tongil Streets, the monument to the victorious 
fatherland liberation war, the three-revolution exhibition and 
the May Day Stadium were built in Pyongyang during the Third 
Seven-Year Plan in accordance with our party's plan for the 
construction of the capital. They graphically illustrate the 
unfathomable creative force of our working people and the might 
of our independent national economy and clearly symbolize the 
heroic mettle of socialist Korea which is advancing triumphantly 
in spite of any upheavals in the world situation. 
  Under our people-centred socialist system our people enjoy a 
worthy and happy life on an equal basis free from any social and 
political unrest and without any worries about their life even 
in the present complex situation, and a beautiful communist 
morality is flowering further throughout our society, the people 
sharing weal and woe and helping and leading each other forward, 
on the principle of one for all and all for one. 
  Through the recent harsh trials and struggle we have 
convincingly proved once again that our party is a great party 
possessing an iron will and capable of seasoned leadership, that 
our people are a heroic people having unshakable revolutionary 
confidence and unbreakable fighting spirit, and that the 
socialism of our own style embodying the chuche idea is an 
unconquerable socialism which has struck its roots deep among 
the popular masses. 
  I express my warm gratitude to our workers, farmers, 
intellectuals, the soldiers of the People's Army and all the 
rest of our people who, under the party's leadership, performed 
brilliant exploits last year in the revolution and construction. 
  The new year 1994 is a year of a revolutionary advance when 
the building of socialism in our country will enter a new stage 
of development; it is a year of a worthy struggle for the entire 
party, the whole country and all the people to make an all-out 
effort and effect a great revolutionary upsurge on all fronts. 
  The internal and external situation of our revolution is 
still complex and tense, and we are building socialism in a 
sharp confrontation with the enemy. 
  To meet the requirements of the present situation and the 
development of our revolution we must carry out the 
revolutionary line of independence, self-sufficiency and 
self-reliant defence and expedite the three revolutions -- 
ideological, technical and cultural -- to further increase the 
political, economic and military power of the country. We must 
consolidate and exploit the successes we have already achieved 
in the socialist construction and must score a fresh, greater 
success. In this way we will add glory to the socialism of our 
country centred on the popular masses and fly the socialist 
banner of chuche higher. 
  Setting the next three years as a period for adjustment in 
the sector of socialist economic construction as decided at the 
twenty-first plenary meeting of the Sixth Party Central 
Committee, we must in this period implement to the letter the 
agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first 
policy. Along with this, we must give definite precedence to 
the coal industry, power industry and rail transport, which must 
advance ahead of the other sectors of the national economy, and 
must continue to develop the metal industry. 
  By carrying out the revolutionary economic strategy of our 
party during the period of adjustment for socialist economic 
construction we will consolidate the foundations of the nation's 
independent economy rock-solid, further improve the people's 
standard of living to meet the socialist requirements and secure 
a new launching point for scaling a higher eminence of socialism. 
  This year we must concentrate our effort on the development 
of agriculture, light industry and foreign trade. 
  This is a meaningful year which will mark the 30th 
anniversary of the publishing of the theses on the socialist 
rural question in our country. By striving to carry out the 
historic tasks set in the theses, we must make a new advance in 
the development of the rural economy. We must consolidate the 
successes achieved in the irrigation and electrification of the 
rural areas, raise the level of mechanization and application of 
chemicals, implement the chuche farming method thoroughly and 
thus boost grain and all other agricultural production. Our 
working class must increase the production of tractors, lorries 
and other modern farm machines, fertilizers, agricultural 
chemicals and a variety of other farming materials, and send 
them to the rural communities. All the cooperative farmers and 
agricultural working people must work in an assiduous and 
methodical manner with an attitude befitting masters who are 
responsible for the nation's granaries so as to attain without 
fail the high goal of grain production set by the party for this 
year. 
  We must step up the revolution in light industry and effect 
a 
great upsurge in the production of consumer goods. We must 
adopt positive measures to improve and reinforce the light 
industry factories, modernize them, and increase the production 
of chemical fibres, synthetic resin and other materials for 
light industry. In this way, we will operate all the light 
industry factories at full capacity and maintain a high and 
steady rate of production. All the sectors and units ranging 
from those in the large-scale central light industry to those in 
the medium and small-scale local industry and those engaged in 
the production of "August 3 consumer goods" must produce various 
kinds of consumer goods in large quantities, increase their 
variety and improve their qualities radically. 
  In order to adapt foreign trade to the changed circumstances 
and develop it, we must cultivate new foreign markets in every 
possible way and build up an unquestionable reputation. We must 
strengthen the bases for the production of export goods in many 
sectors of the national economy, increase their production and 
improve their qualities. All the sectors and regions must 
further boost export by exploring and using the resources for 
export and also develop processing trade. 
  In order to develop agriculture and light industry and 
accelerate economic construction throughout the country, we must 
put efforts into the coal, electric power and metal industries 
and find a better solution to the problem of rail transport. 
The coal and electric power industries must make effective use 
of the existing production bases and create more production 
capacity in order to increase coal and power production greatly. 
We must strengthen the material and technical foundations of 
the railways, organize and direct transportation meticulously, 
lay heavy-duty rails extensively and satisfy the ever-increasing 
demands of the national economy for transport. 
  All the economic sectors and units must launch a vigorous 
campaign for increased production and economy as a mass movement 
and make effective use of the existing labour, equipment and 
materials. They must tap potential reserves to the full to 
increase production to the maximum. 
  All the economic officials must organize economic work and 
direct production efficiently in accordance with the party's 
economic strategy. They must give full rein to the people's 
revolutionary enthusiasm and creative activity and encourage 
them to overfulfill this year's national economic plan. 
  Our intellectuals have an honourable duty to contribute 
their 
scientific knowledge and skills to socialist construction. 
Adhering to our party's policy of cultural revolution, they 
must strive devotedly to make new advances in science, 
education, literature and art, public health and all other 
fields of developing socialist culture. 
  This year, too, we must naturally put efforts into 
strengthening the country's defence power to counter the enemy's 
moves to provoke war. We must be fully prepared politically and 
ideologically, militarily and materially, to deal with any 
contingency on our initiative; we must establish a social 
climate of regarding military affairs as important and assisting 
the People's Army whole-heartedly. 
  In order to push ahead with the revolution and construction 
in the present situation, we must hold fast to our party's 
policy of the ideological revolution, further strengthen the 
single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks and fully 
display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. 
  Single-hearted unity and self-reliance are imperishable, 
glorious traditions of our revolution as well as the banner of 
victory. With the strength of single-hearted unity we have 
broken through harsh trials and opened up a brilliant road of 
victory; with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance we have 
overcome all difficulties and brought about great changes in the 
revolution and construction. When all the people are united 
with a single heart behind the party and the leader and fight 
courageously, displaying a high revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude, we can defend and develop the 
socialism of our own style for ever in whatever trials and 
accomplish the socialist cause of chuche victoriously. 
  We must defend like the apple of our eye the single-hearted 
unity of our revolutionary ranks that has been cemented 
rock-solid under the leadership of our party and consolidate and 
develop it further. 
  We must display higher the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude, break through difficulties in our 
way and effect a fresh upsurge in the building of socialism. 
"Let us accelerate vigorously the general march of socialism in 
the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude" this is 
the call of our party and the militant slogan which our people 
must uphold today. All the officials, party members and other 
working people must, in hearty response to the party's militant 
call, make continued innovations and uninterrupted advance in 
the spirit of Chollima spurred by the "speed of the '90s" and 
make the new year 1994 a year of historic advance in the 
revolution and construction in our country. 
  To reunify the country is the supreme task of our nation 
which must not be delayed. We must accomplish the cause of 
national reunification as soon as possible, so as to meet the 
unanimous, ardent desire of the entire nation and hand down the 
reunified country to our posterity. 
  With a view to paving the way to national reunification by 
the united effort of the nation, our party and the government of 
our Republic put forward "10-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" last 
year and made all our efforts to put it into effect. This 
10-point programme embodies the noble desire of our 70 million 
compatriots to achieve a solid unity of the whole nation 
transcending the difference in ideology, ideal and system and 
realise reunification and prosperity of our nation with a long 
history of five thousand years. We hoped the South Korean 
authorities to take the road of reconciliation and cooperation 
in response to our 10-point programme of great national unity, 
we also made an important proposal for an exchange of top-level 
special envoys between the two sides. 
  But the South Korean authorities have taken the path of 
dependence on foreign forces, not national independence, and of 
confrontation between North and South, not national unity, by 
ignoring our magnanimous proposal and the desire of the entire 
nation for reunification. They have staged large-scale military 
exercises against our Republic frequently in collusion with 
foreign forces and have been jeopardizing North-South relations 
by clamouring for "military counteraction" and an "international 
cooperation system" on the pretext of our "nuclear problem." 
  The so-called "civilian" regime in South Korea is only a 
disguise; in fact it does not differ from the successive 
military dictatorial regimes. The evil anti-communist fascist 
laws still remain intact in South Korea, and the desire of the 
South Korean people for independence, democracy and national 
reunification is not fulfilled. It is natural that the South 
Korean people and public figures say that there is no need to 
watch the present South Korean regime any longer and that they 
have nothing to expect from it. 
  As for our "nuclear problem" about which the United States 
and her lackeys are making a fuss, it is the product of the 
obstinate maneuvers of the United States against socialism and 
our Republic. It is the United States that has created the 
fictitious "doubt about nuclear development by the North", and 
it is the United States that has actually shipped nuclear 
weapons into the Korean peninsula and have been threatening us. 
Therefore, the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula must on 
any account be settled through Korea-U.S. talks. 
  Pressure or threat will have no effect on us; such an 
attempt 
may invite catastrophe, far from finding a solution to the 
problem. The United States must see all the fact squarely and 
behave with prudence. Since a joint statement has been adopted 
by Korea and the United States, the nuclear problem on the 
Korean peninsula can be settled fairly if both sides keep and 
implement the principles that have been agreed upon. 
  The principles and the line of our party and the government 
of our Republic on national reunification remain unchanged. In 
future, too, we will make every effort to reunify the country in 
the form of confederation which is based on one nation, one 
state, two systems and two governments, on the three principles 
of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity. 
  The destiny of the motherland is immediately the destiny of 
the nation, as well as the destiny of all our compatriots at 
home and abroad. All the Korean people in the North, in the 
South and abroad must launch a nationwide struggle, rallied as 
one under the banner of great unity of the whole nation, and 
open a new phase for national reunification this year. 
  The imperialists are now blustering on the international 
arena by vociferating about the "end" of socialism, but they 
cannot arrest the people's aspiration to independence, 
sovereignty and socialism nor can they turn back the trend of 
history. If the world progressive people push forward 
historical progress by strengthening unity and solidarity under 
the banner of independence against imperialism, they will be 
able to shape a bright future of mankind at an earliest date 
without fail. 
  Our party and the government of our Republic will 
consistently implement the foreign policy of independence, peace 
and friendship in keeping with the requirements of the present 
situation. On the principle of independence we will make 
positive efforts to unite with socialist countries and 
non-aligned countries and develop good neighbourly relations 
also with capitalist countries which respect the sovereignty of 
our country. The government of our Republic will work hard to 
abolish the old international political and economic orders of 
domination and subordination, establish new ones on the basis of 
equality, justice and fairness and develop South-South 
cooperation on the principle of collective self-reliance. 
  Our people's struggle today is arduous, but it is a noble 
and 
honourable struggle for the prosperity of our country and for 
the future of mankind. Our people who are fighting for the just 
cause under the leadership of the great party will always emerge 
victorious. 
  Let all of us fight on vigorously to achieve a new success 
in 
socialist construction and hasten the independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country, united rock-solid behind the party 
Central Committee under the unfurled banner of the chuche idea.

<F P=106> [New Year's Day address by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, </F>
followed by a question and answer session with unidentified 
domestic reporters, at the prime minister's official residence 
on 30 December -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Hosokawa, reading from a prepared text] I wish all 
of you a happy New Year. On this New Year's Day, I would like 
to state candidly my thoughts on what Japan should pursue and 
where it should head to prepare itself for the 21st century. 
Last year, 1993, was an epoch-making year. It was a year when 
a political stalemate was broken in the midst of the people's 
high expectations and the coalition government was inaugurated. 
It is a historical inevitability to fundamentally rebuild 
Japan's political, economic, and social systems which have 
become obsolete into new ones. Therefore, my new government is 
strongly feeling anew its responsibility to lay a major 
historical turning point for changes in Japan while regarding 
the responsibility as a historical mission. 
  There are various factors dictating the need for Japan to 
change. I would like to explain those factors, confining them to 
the following two points. First, Japan is moving toward a 
society of senior citizens at an unprecedented rate. Looking at 
the population's composition, Japan is shifting from the most 
vital age to the most difficult age. Basic ideals, which so far 
have shored up Japanese society, are being forced to change. 
For example, Japan should develop new plans of action, after 
departing from the economic expansion policy that Japan has 
adopted since the Meiji Era, to catch up with and overtake 
European nations and the United States. I have often wondered if 
people around the world really want to live in Japan. To be 
sure, Japan has many characteristics such as safe living, high 
income level, and long life expectancy that it can boast to the 
rest of the world. I am convinced that Japan can build itself 
into a proud society by taking the initiative in pushing for 
reforms even if it may bring some suffering to the people. I 
would like to make three specific proposals to prepare Japan for 
the 21st century. First, I would like to mention the building 
of a society where senior citizens can lead their lives full of 
vitality. The senior citizens of the 21st century are a 
generation consisting of people like me. We will have to feel 
that we can work and contribute to society as long as our health 
permits us to, as Japan moves toward the world's top life 
expectancy society. It is necessary to work on building a 
society to fulfill such a need. I believe that it is important 
to build a society where 65-year-old people can work. I intend 
to help senior citizens continue to work by creating a new 
employment insurance. I will strive to build a society where 
65-year-olds can work by revamping the current pension system 
and providing social insurance to part-time workers. At the 
same time, I will strive to create a climate where women can 
work easily, establish a new child-care leave payment system, 
and improve the facilities of child-care centers in an effort to 
help raise our children to bear Japan's future. What concerns 
senior citizens the most is home care service, and the costs of 
such service. I intend to work vigorously on improving 
home-care service after reviewing the current 10-year strategy, 
the so-called Golden Plan, for the insurance of senior citizens. 
I also intend to review the current medical insurance system 
and vigorously promote a new nurse-service system which does not 
require patient's family members to take care of him while in 
the hospital. From the standpoint of improving the current 
medical system and Japan's international contributions to the 
medical arena, I am thinking of shaping a new 10-year strategy 
to combat such intractable diseases as cancer. I believe that 
if we vigorously come to grips with building a society of senior 
citizens, the society will become vital and bright. In line 
with the ideas I put forth just a while ago, I am thinking of 
shaping a comprehensive welfare vision for the society of senior 
citizens. Second, I would like to mention the building of a 
living infrastructure which is of affluence and high quality. 
  Looking at our daily lives, people residing in local 
areas complain that they have fewer job opportunities than those 
residing in urban areas and they feel that the cultural and 
educational level in their local areas is low. Many urban 
residents complain that they do not feel comfortable with their 
lives, citing housing problems and commuting hell. I believe 
that it is essential to gradually turn all of those areas into 
attractive areas for the people. To that end, I intend to 
formulate a guideline for decentralization within this year and 
push for the administrative reform of local governments with 
legislation on decentralization in mind. At the same time, I 
also intend to vigorously seek to upgrade the infrastructure 
while giving priority to creating a living environment that is 
compatible with the actual situation of localities. For 
example, only 10 percent of cities, towns, and villages with 
less than 50,000 residents now enjoy a sewage system. The 
present situation is that more than half of the people live 
without a sewage system. I intend to help more than 90 percent 
of the people gain access to a sewage system. I plan to examine 
the possibility of raising the paved road rate in rural villages 
to that in medium cities. Building an efficient high-speed 
traffic network, which links major local cities with each other 
by highway, rail, and air, is essential to turning our nation 
into a multipolar and diversified land. For example, I intend 
to enable 98 percent of the population to arrive in interchanges 
within one hour by extending the current 6,000 km of the 
superhighway network to 14,000 km by the early 21st century. 
  Next, I would like to propose the Housing 21 Plan designed 
to 
have all the people live in a comfortable housing climate in the 
21st century. The plan calls for widening the per capita living 
space 30 percent and I intend to work to make it possible for 
every person to enjoy 40 square meters of living space. I also 
plan to promote the construction of housing in concert with the 
construction of towns. To that end, I intend to boldly reform 
the housing industry, promote competition among housing 
builders, and largely cut the high costs of housing construction 
with the goal of making it possible for the people to build 
their own houses with one-third the money they have spent in the 
past. The effective use of land is a major policy task. From 
the standpoint of effectively using land, I will aggressively 
study the possibility of relaxing regulations concerning land 
use. In addition, I plan to make towns beautiful by drawing up 
a greenery plan to increase the acreage of greenery in urban 
areas by three times. In a bid to relax urban traffic gridlock, 
I will aim for comfortable commuting in urban areas by improving 
the rail service and constructing quadruple-track rail lines 
[double tracks going in each direction] in urban areas. In this 
way, I intend to upgrade the people's living infrastructure. 
  Third, I would like to mention the building of a 
comprehensive and characteristic society. When I think of the 
future world, I believe that the full growth of diversified 
characters will give rise to unique cultures and economic 
activities which will in return become a source of new vitality. 
This is an important element for Japan to act as a responsible 
member of the international community and contribute to the 
community. From that point of view, I believe that my 
government should strive to promote research in high- 
technology, in which Japan is said to lag behind other nations. 
I think that to that end, it is necessary to promote basic 
research in the areas of space, life, material, and energy. I 
intend to give budgetary priority to important research and 
development programs to prepare Japan for the 21st century, 
while seeking to consolidate the infrastructure to train 
outstanding researchers and upgrading research facilities. 
Regarding the promotion of culture and arts, I plan to foster 
young artists who will bear the future of Japan's arts, increase 
subsidies to unique local cultural activities and build a 
society where culture prospers. At the same time, it is 
important to create a climate wherein Japan can freely talk with 
other nations and they can understand each other's diversity. 
From that point, I plan to promote truly meaningful 
international exchanges under which Japan accepts 100,000 
foreign students for study here. 
  Next, there is the information industry which may be a 
typical example of an economic area filled with creativity. 
Thanks to fast progress in information communication 
technology, it will become possible early in the 21st century 
for people to watch programs all over the world at any time and 
to even receive medical and administrative services at home. 
  It will become necessary to push for overall deregulation of 
the communications sector to enable accelerated improvement of 
existing networks and the launching of new projects by private 
businesses. But it is never easy to realize such an invigorating 
and abundant society. It takes so many financial resources to 
implement social security programs and to improve social 
overhead capital, while aiming to create a creativity-filled 
society. No doubt, necessary costs and responsibilities should 
be shared among us in a fair and appropriate manner. Without 
that, it will be impossible to realize the society we seek to be 
in by the 21st century. 
  To ensure that society does not lose its vitality from high 
tax burdens, we are resolved to contain the people's burdens to 
below 50 percent, even at the aging population's peak time in 
the 21st century. We must think hard and come up with the best 
possible ideas. 
  We must implement administrative reform, with an emphasis on 
deregulation, as well as fundamental revision of government 
expenditures. My government should boldly relax regulations 
which will generate the maximum effect -- in areas closely tied 
to people's lives like distribution, housing and land, new types 
of businesses like information communications and industries 
which will contribute to expanding employment. 
  Even when these efforts are made, however, I think that if 
an 
abundant and invigorating society is to be realized in the 21st 
century, some increases in individuals' tax burdens will be 
unavoidable. Right now, one senior citizen is supported by five 
working citizens, but when our aging society peaks, one senior 
citizen will be supported by only two working citizens. 
  Simply put, the burdens will more than double. No doubt, we 
must also think about increased social security insurance 
premiums with a further aging population and increased tax 
burdens to improve social overhead capital. If we look at the 
existing tax system from such a viewpoint, because the weight of 
individual income tax in the tax system is so large, so much of 
the burdens need to be borne by the generation of working 
people. If the present condition is allowed to continue, it 
will excessively task the generation supporting the aging 
society. If the willingness of the working generation and the 
vigor of the society as a whole are to be fully maintained, it 
will become necessary to reconsider the burdens of the people 
and to bring a tax system which ensures a balance between 
income, consumption, and assets. 
  As such, I have come to think the best choice given to us is 
to push for a tax system reform with a national consensus -- 
along the lines of the tax reform policy recommended by the Tax 
Commission which is aimed at realizing a fair and invigorating 
society of the aged population. I would like to have the 
nation's understanding on this. 
  Lastly, I would like to speak about international affairs. 
Japan's prosperity is only possible if the world's free trade 
system is maintained. I believe that the recent conclusion of 
the Uruguay Round is truly significant. It is a matter of 
course for my government to give full consideration to the 
impact of the Round's conclusion. In particular, my government 
will take measures to enable farmers to engage in farming free 
of concerns. I believe the government must take measures to 
ensure the future of the farmers and thus prevent the nation's 
food self-sufficiency rate from further dropping. 
  Listening to voices from other nations, Japan is still 
closed. Japan's savings are too high while its investments are 
too small. Japan is criticized for that. Needless to say, some 
of such criticism is based on misunderstanding, but we have to 
vigorously improve what needs to be improved. The aggressive 
upgrading of the current infrastructure to prepare for a society 
of senior citizens is not for the sake of other nations, but for 
the sake of ourselves. To do that, we need to secure revenue 
resources which will not leave excessive burdens to the future 
generation. Once that is done, I think we will have to review 
the basic plan on public works investments including possible 
revisions and increases of the investment allocations. 
  I am convinced that we will be able to build Japan's 
economic 
society into one that is open to other nations through the 
course of implementing those policies. 
  Of course, the economic and social reforms being proposed 
here are not something that can be done by the government alone. 
And all reforms accompany pains. Besides, the choices we can 
take are very limited. I hope we will be able to challenge 
difficulties with the cooperation of the people, and build an 
age which is full of ideals of hopes -- by sharing pains among 
all of us. 
  With the so-called economic bubble having gone and with 
inventories having undergone readjustments, this is the year 
when the economy should recover in full scale. I am confident 
that we will have a good economic new year if we move toward the 
vision presented today, while doing the best in overcoming the 
immediate issues of the economy. I pray that this year may be a 
fruitful year for all of you, the people of the nation. Thank 
you. 
  [Reporter] Then, we would like to begin asking questions. 
First, Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to ask this question in 
connection with the vision you talked about just now. Talking 
about the tax system reform, you have said that the reform would 
not mean simply raising or lowering tax rates, and that you 
would present a vision. So, I assume the vision you mentioned 
today is the vision you have said was forthcoming. Bluntly put, 
can I say that you are asking the people to understand that an 
increase in the consumption tax is unavoidable? 
  [Hosokawa] No, I did not mean to refer to the consumption 
tax rate issue. The vision for the 21st century is, as the 
words say, the vision for the 21st century. I presented a 
long-term view on what the future economic society should look 
like. With the aging population, an increase in [tax] burdens 
is unavoidable. If we choose to avoid increasing burdens, then 
we will have no choice but to reduce social security benefits. 
  On the other hand, if we choose to rely on debts, while that 
may be all right with the people of our generation, it will 
result in leaving many burdens to our children and 
grandchildren. If the working generation bears excessive 
burdens with the population aging proceeding, there will arise 
the question of whether society's vitality can be maintained or 
the question of whether the working generation will not lose 
their will to work -- despite that. When we think about this 
point, it becomes clear we have to consider -- as pointed out in 
the Tax Commission's recommendation and the Hiraiwa Commission's 
report -- about the relationship between the interests and 
burdens of the people and about the tax system which can ensure 
balance between income, assets, and consumption. 
  As such, I presented in the vision my view on how the 
people's interests and benefits should be balanced. 
  [Reporter] I would like to ask once again. Today, you said 
you will push for an overall tax system reform based on the 
national consensus. Could you have used that expression with 
the reduction of income tax and the increase of consumption tax 
-- in the future -- in mind? 
  [Hosokawa] I may be repeating what I said just now. With 
the aging society arriving, an increase in burdens will be 
unavoidable. I think it will be irresponsible to avoid bearing 
the increased burdens. The consultative committee of the 
government and ruling parties is now discussing what 
specifically we should do -- from a broad perspective, in 
consideration of the Tax Commission's recommendation. By the 
time the 1994 budget is formulated in mid- or late-January, the 
committee will come up with a conclusion. The government will 
make a decision after seeing the committee's conclusion. 
  [Reporter] You did not make yourself clear on the question 
of the consumption tax increase. But according to the vision 
you presented, you want to go for an overall tax system reform 
based on the Tax Commission's recommendation. I think it is 
clear what you wanted to say really was that there is no choice 
but to raise the consumption tax rate in the future. The reason 
you cannot speak clearly about it is because the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is strongly opposed to it. I 
would like to ask if you can convince the SDPJ? 
  [Hosokawa] That is a tough question. I think there are 
several prerequisites for promoting a comprehensive tax system 
reform. For example, we must rationalize expenditures and 
correct unfair practices in taxation. Among these 
prerequisites, a drastic review of the balance between direct 
and indirect taxes is one of the biggest issues related to the 
nation's comprehensive tax reform. Regarding the government's 
conclusion on the issue, however, I must repeat that is still 
under debate among the coalition parties. The consultative 
committee composed of all parties is discussing the matter. 
Since the burdens are unavoidable, I think the committee will 
come to some sort of conclusion. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, it seemed your statement 
today focused on mid- and long-term government tasks; however, 
in your New Year's statement, I think the public wanted to hear 
your stance toward emergency pump-priming measures. What is 
your actual plan for the new pump-priming package? 
  [Hosokawa] With respect to economic measures, the government 
has already hammered out several pump-priming packages. And, 
through the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the 
initial budget for fiscal 1994, we are going to implement 
ceaseless economic stimulus measures to cover the coming 15 
months. Our budget formulation work gives much consideration to 
stimulation of the economy, and it will certainly brighten the 
Japanese economy's future. By the time the [1994] budget is 
formulated, economic measures will become fixed, and I certainly 
hope the measures will meet the people's expectations. 
  [Reporter] In connection with the previous question on the 
people's greatest concern, could you tell me the size of the 
income tax reduction and its revenue resources? 
  [Hosokawa] I cannot give an answer to that at this point. 
The government and the ruling parties are discussing the matter 
now. I think a conclusion will shape up by the middle of 
January. 
  [Reporter] You have just stated that the government will 
take actions to secure employment of workers over 65 years old 
as a mid- to long-term task. However, the unemployment rate is 
gradually picking up nationwide, and the number of jobless is 
increasing in the business sector. In this regard, how much do 
you estimate the nation's unemployment and economic growth rates 
in 1994 will be? 
  [Hosokawa] The government is scheduled to announce its 
economic forecast in mid-January in definite figures. 
Concerning employment-securing measures, I have repeatedly said 
in Diet interpellations that the government is trying its best 
to draw up measures for securing employment at the Labor 
Ministry's initiative. In fact, employment conditions are 
becoming serious in the nation, and I am really concerned about 
the present circumstances. As I noted in my New Year's 
statement and a previous news conference, the government intends 
to deal with employment-related issues with every possible 
measure. I am serving as the chairman of the government's 
employment policy headquarters to fully engage in the task. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, my question is again about 
the government's tax reduction plan. Chairman Hiroshi Kato, of 
the advisory Tax System Research Council, met with you 
yesterday, and insisted that the government should promise a 
future increase of the consumption tax if the income tax is 
implemented this fiscal year. In other words, he said a bill for 
income tax cuts should include a pledge on a future increase of 
the consumption tax rate. While you take a stance to attach 
importance to tax panel policies, are you really going to enact 
the income tax cut and the consumption tax hike at the same time? 
  [Hosokawa] As a matter of course, we have to attach much 
importance to the tax panel's opinions; but the government's 
attitude toward the panel's advisory report is also under debate 
at the consultative committee organized by the coalition 
parties. The committee will determine the coalition's tax 
reform policy hopefully in consideration of the tax panel's 
advisory report. 
  [Reporter] In the statement's conclusion, you said the 
business climate will improve this year after the stock 
adjustment phase. When we assess if the stock adjustment phase 
is well under way, we must pay attention to the fact that 
financial institutes' bad loans are one of the main reasons for 
the prolonged recession. This is a significant difference from 
the preceding recessions. So, some people are questioning if 
the government has the proper remedy for the stagnant economy. 
They say the government must have drastic and unusual remedies, 
such as large-scale public investments and income tax cuts with 
the issuance of deficit-covering bonds. What is your attitude 
toward such an opinion? 
  [Hosokawa] I have repeatedly noted that we must be very 
careful of thoughtless dependence on deficit-covering bonds. On 
the other hand, the government is seriously seeking measures to 
encourage transactions of real estate. While we have no 
definite plans right now, we are trying very hard to seize some 
good ideas. 
  [Reporter] Again on the consumption tax. Mr. Prime 
Minister, it seems you intend to wait for the coalition parties' 
discussions to end, but you will have to make your own decision 
sooner or later. Do you have the resolve to demonstrate your 
leadership to make a future-oriented decision on tax revenues? 
  [Hosokawa] I am very sorry, but I cannot answer that 
question at this point. Taking into account a conclusion drawn 
by the coalition parties, I would like to make a proper decision 
for the future. 
  [Reporter] To cope with the aging society, you have 
clarified your stance to ask heavier burdens of the public. To 
improve services for the aged, it is necessary to reinforce 
manpower to work on this field. On the other hand, the 
government is expected to have more manpower through 
deregulation policies. Do you intend to minimize the public's 
burdens by utilizing the surplus manpower to overcome 
bureaucratic sectionalism? 
  [Hosokawa] That is an interesting idea but I have no 
definite plan yet. 
  [Reporter] Your statement includes guidelines on various 
issues; however, it may be difficult to carry them out under 
bureaucratic sectionalism. While the statement advocates 
administrative reform, how will you draw up definite measures? 
  [Hosokawa] As a matter of course, individual ministries and 
agencies are primarily in charge, and outlines of reform plans 
are introduced to the coalition parties' leaders. They will 
thoroughly discuss administrative reform, and its details will 
be materialized in the 1994 budget and other government 
policies. Of course, proposals in my statement are based on 
ministries' policies, such as economic programs, the five-year 
plan for improving social infrastructures, and the national 
development plan. Also, the Hiraiwa Commission and the tax 
panel gave me lots of suggestions. My statement was made in 
accord with all of these. I am just explaining such proposals 
in my own words; they may look more drastic, though. I will 
request the ministries draw up tangible measures for carrying 
out administrative reform based on my principles. 
  [Reporter] Please let me ask again on this point. Since the 
Finance Ministry and the SDPJ are not in accord on the treatment 
of the consumption tax, your leadership as prime minister is 
likely to be strongly expected on this issue. Could you explain 
your resolve again? 
  [Hosokawa] Needless to say, I have to make final 
decisions, regardless of whether it is a matter of rice or 
something else. Anyhow, it is an important issue. We have to 
find a desirable balance between receiving benefits and sharing 
burdens. Anyhow, as I have said earlier, our society is aging 
and it is unavoidable that the working people's burden will grow 
heavier. Under such a circumstance, some people may say that 
they do not want to shoulder the burden. Others may say that 
they do not want to see a further decline in social security 
services. What kind of decision are the people going to 
support? Are they going to say that it is important not to 
lower the standard of the social security services, even at the 
cost of bearing some burdens? Are they going to say that they 
will accept lowering the standard of income security [shotoku 
hosho] because they do not want to shoulder the burdens? Or, 
are they going to accept a significant increase in the burden on 
people in the prime of their working lives or the loss of this 
vital power of society? Anyhow, we have to make our decision on 
the choices we have. Of course, it is very difficult to have 
everybody's consensus. However, the ruling parties are studying 
these matters to make their decision, which will be accepted by 
as many people as possible. They will be able to show the 
people several choices. After going through these processes, I 
will have to make my final decision. 
  [Reporter] Let me ask you a question regarding a final 
decision you have just mentioned. You said earlier that the 
ruling parties, which are currently studying the issue, will 
make their decision around mid-January. Are you going to make 
your final decision before the end of January even if they fail 
to reach an agreement by mid-January? 
  [Hosokawa] They have to make a decision. I want them to do 
their best to come up with some kind of decision by all means. 
  [Reporter] I am going to ask you about the political reform 
bills. Discussions in the House of Councillors are virtually at 
a standstill. How are you going to display your leadership to 
find a way out of this situation? 
  [Hosokawa] Frankly speaking, I would like them to start 
discussions immediately. Anyway, more than 40 days have passed 
since the bills were sent to the House of Councillors. Well, we 
had to deal with the supplementary budget proposals and other 
things, such as the Uruguay Round, during this time. 
Accordingly, discussions at the House of Representatives did 
not go smoothly. I understand this very well. However, we 
still have a considerable number of days left for discussions 
after New Year's Day. Therefore, I do want to pass the political 
reform bills during the current Diet session; in the past five 
years, we have vainly tried to approve political reform bills. 
I will do my best to promote Diet deliberations on the bills. 
A fundamental way is to have detailed discussions in the Diet 
on the bills in the presence of both ruling and opposition 
parties. If an agreement can be reached at Diet discussions, 
the government, of course, is ready to respect it. 
  [Reporter] Are you not planning to make a compromise by 
making major changes to the bills? 
  [Hosokawa] Well, the answer to your question may be a 
repetition of what I have said earlier. However, I am of the 
opinion that the fundamental approach is to have discussions 
between the ruling and opposition parties to reach an agreement. 
  [Reporter] Regarding the political reform bills, it seems 
that some people are again saying that an election system reform 
should be treated apart from the prevention of political 
corruption. What is your opinion on this? 
  [Hosokawa] As I repeatedly said during the Diet meetings, 
these issues are like front and rear wheels of a car. We have 
to change the current medium-sized constituency system, in which 
members of the same parties fight with each other during 
elections. I do not think the bill on preventing political 
corruption alone will improve politics. I think simultaneous 
approval of the four bills is necessary by all means to realize 
political reform. 
  [Reporter] Some members of the ruling parties are also 
talking about the possibility of dissolving the lower house. 
What do you think of dissolving the lower house amid the 
depression? 
  [Hosokawa] I have no such plan. 
  [Reporter] Let me go back to the economic issue. [words 
indistinct] Do you think that ruling parties will hold joint 
meetings in January to talk about short- and medium-term 
comprehensive matters -- not only emergency economic measures -- 
while keeping an eye on the 21st century in particular? 
  [Hosokawa] We have to form a draft budget for the next 
fiscal year while keeping an eye on long-term matters. 
  [Reporter] You said earlier that you were not thinking about 
dissolving the lower house. In a recent news conference, you 
said that you were prepared for the worst. What are you going 
to do if the reform bills are not approved? 
  [Hosokawa] I cannot disclose what I am planning to do. 
There are many things that I am thinking about. 
  [Reporters] You have canceled your planned trip to Europe. 
Japan-U.S. summit talks will be held in February. Can you give 
us an outline of your diplomatic schedule for this year? 
  [Hosokawa] Japan-U.S. summit talks will be held in February. 
Dealing with the Japan-U.S. comprehensive economic consultations 
is a very difficult task. We are now doing our best to deal 
with the negotiations, which are very difficult. As a major 
topic, the results of the consultations will probably be 
confirmed at the upcoming Japan-U.S. summit talks. Other than 
that, I have no urgent diplomatic plan for the time being. Of 
course, summits [of the Group of Seven developed countries] will 
be held in July. However, I have no concrete diplomatic plans 
for the period between now and July. 
  [Reporter] Reportedly, you were invited to visit China. Are 
you planning to visit China? 
  [Hosokawa] I have received an invitation from China and from 
some European countries. But, I have not decided yet on a 
concrete schedule. 
  [Reporter] I will ask you questions about a totally 
different matter. It is regarding 100 million yen you borrowed 
from the Sagawa group. The opposition parties are determined to 
ask you questions on this matter at the Diet meetings right 
after New Year's Day. Do you think that the document, which you 
submitted earlier to both lower and upper houses, is enough to 
explain the situation? Also, are you not planning to correct 
what was written in the document? 
  [Hosokawa] I am earnestly trying to see if I can submit 
something additional. At this moment, I cannot say for sure 
whether or not I will be able to submit anything else. However, 
I believe that the document I submitted earlier dispelled the 
doubt that I did not pay back the money. However, I heard some 
people are still suspicious. Therefore, I am trying to see if I 
can submit additional documents. 
  [Reporter] In addition to a doubt regarding whether or not 
you have paid back the money, some people suspect that the money 
was used toward expenses for your gubernatorial election. They 
suspect that the money was not used in the way you have 
explained. Can you comment on this? 
  [Hosokawa] As I repeatedly explained at the Diet, I did not 
borrow the money to use for political purposes. 
  [Reporter] I would like to ask you again a question 
regarding the consumption tax. It sounded to me as if you were 
saying at the beginning of your speech that you had no choice 
but to increase the consumption tax rate. I think what you said 
was not very clear to the people either. You have been saying 
that you had entrusted the ruling parties with studying the 
consumption tax issue. Do you not think that the people would 
have a clear understanding if you explained to them that the 
government has no choice but to increase the consumption tax 
sooner or later? 
  [Hosokawa] I understand what you mean. But, it will be like 
putting the cart before the horse if I explained my ideas and 
showed a certain direction before the ruling parties come up 
with their proposals. In their meetings, the ruling parties are 
studying various choices the people can make. I am of the 
opinion that I should make my final decision after the ruling 
parties come up with their proposals. 
  [Reporter] Concerning an income tax cut, you repeatedly 
said since last autumn that you want to wait for discussions on 
the issue and a report to be worked out by the Tax Reform 
Council. But all of a sudden, in December, you expressed a plan 
to set up the ruling parties' Economic Affairs Consultation 
Council to ask the council to discuss the income tax cut issue. 
In this connection, however, Manae Kubota, director general of 
the Economic Planning Agency, said in a news conference that a 
political decision should be made on this issue. There is a 
voice among the people that you lack leadership and that the 
government has missed the timing of carrying out the income tax 
cut. How do you answer this view? 
  [Hosokawa] Well, I fully understand that the people greatly 
expect the government to carry out the income tax cut. But as I 
have repeatedly mentioned earlier, if we carry out the income 
tax cut without securing the revenue sources, the next 
generations will have to pay for it, and I do not think this is 
desirable. For that reason, my view is that we need to 
seriously study this issue. I know that the situation will be 
more serious if we miss the opportunity. With this in mind, I 
think it is necessary to promote discussions on this issue while 
seeking the ruling parties' understanding. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you have constantly said that 
the excessive issuance of deficit-covering bonds is undesirable. 
It is probably ideal for the government to include both the tax 
cut and tax hike in the government's draft bill on tax reform. 
But assuming that the government fails to include the tax cut 
and hike in its bill but instead reaches an agreement with the 
ruling coalition to issue short-term bonds to make up for a loss 
caused by the tax cut, do you think the issuance of 
deficit-covering bonds under the agreement among the ruling 
parties is still undesirable? 
  [Hosokawa] I am asking the ruling coalition to strain their 
wits to study this issue including the possible issuance of 
short-term deficit-covering bonds, and I also hope that they 
will come up with some ideas. 
  [Reporter] I think you probably have difficulties in 
adjusting policies with the ruling parties and ministries or 
agencies concerned, but I think that not only the reporters here 
but also the people feel that your political stance is changing 
now from your original position wherein you said that you would 
show your policies to the people in a straightforward manner. 
I think this is why the people think you lack leadership in 
solving issues, including the issue of cutting taxes and raising 
the consumption tax. How do you consider your current position? 
  [Hosokawa] I know what you are saying. But I am required to 
manage the government in the unprecedented political situation 
wherein the eight parties form a coalition. On the rice issue, 
I gave my utmost to the very limit to obtain consensus from 
members of the ruling parties to prevent Japan from being 
isolated from the international community. From my office, I 
repeatedly called GATT Director General Sutherland and asked him 
to wait for another one or two hours while waiting for an 
agreement among the ruling parties. So, eventually, as you know, 
I made a decision on the partial opening of the rice market. If 
I should make any decision without discussions among the ruling 
parties, the coalition government composed of the eight parties 
would collapse. I do not think it is desirable to break the 
coalition government. I fully understand that the people are 
eager to see my early decisionmaking. In the past, the cabinet 
was allowed to solve issues one by one. However, many issues 
are simultaneously falling upon the current coalition 
government. I think that even when it was the one-party rule by 
the Liberal Democratic Party, there must have been sharp debates 
within the party on such difficult issues. But now, exchange of 
sharp debates within the government is inevitable because the 
coalition government is formed by eight parties. Given such a 
situation, what I can do is to promote discussions among the 
ruling parties to reflect the people's expectations in the 
government's policy as much as possible and then make a decision 
while seeking possible compromise among the ruling parties. So, 
this is what I want the people to understand. 
  [Reporter] There is the view that the Hosokawa government is 
attaching importance only to domestic issues and ignoring its 
relations with the United States. What do you think of this? 
  [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, Japan and the United States 
are facing very difficult economic issues. However, I think 
that through the previous two meetings, the President and I have 
further deepened our understanding that the basic relations 
between Japan and the United States have been playing a great 
role in the world and the international community. 
  The issues concerning the Japan-U.S. economic framework 
talks need to be immediately solved. For example, priority is 
given to such microeconomics issues as autos and auto parts, 
government procurement, insurance, and ways to beef up the U.S. 
companies' competitive power. The Japanese Government is facing 
too many difficult issues. But aside from these issues, the 
government is making efforts to provide good results regarding 
the important issues between Japan and the United States by the 
time a summit is held in February. Although the issues may not 
be solved perfectly, I think we have to come to some conclusions 
which both Japan and the United States can accept. President 
Clinton and I also have fully confirmed it is significant and 
important to deepen firm bilateral relations in the 
international community and accomplish global cooperation in 
solving such issues as environmental protection and measures to 
cope with the growing world population and AIDS other than the 
immediate microeconomics issues. And I understand that our 
views remain unchanged. 
  [Dean of the press corps] Time has come now to close the 
prime minister's New Year news conference. Thank you very much.

Senior General Than Shwe, chairman of the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council, at the Independence Day flag raising 
ceremony held in Rangoon's People's Square on 4 January -- read 
by announcer] 
  [Text] The date 4 January 1994 is a special and auspicious 
day that marks the 46th independence anniversary of our Union of 
Myanmar [Burma]. On this 46th anniversary of independence, I 
respectfully extend my good wishes to the indigenous people 
residing in the nation. 
  Our Union of Myanmar, which had existed as a sovereign 
nation 
in the world for centuries, was subjected to acts of aggression, 
annexation, and servitude by avaricious colonialist-imperialists 
for three times during the 19th century. Our patriotic 
indigenous brethren took up available arms, fought and repulsed 
this aggression, annexation, and servitude by 
colonialist-imperialists. These patriotic Kachin, Kayah, Karen, 
Chin, Bamah, Mon, Rakhine, and Shan nationals, who waged the 
anti-imperialist struggle for national liberation, will be 
remembered as patriotic heroes in the annals of our history. 
There were millions of people like these heroes. They included 
military personnel, public servants, and ordinary people -- 
children of people -- who fought with their lives and blood to 
uphold the nation's independence. The citizens of Myanmar have 
the firm tradition of cherishing and protecting their 
independence. We have the duty not only to uphold this spirit 
in our generation but to pass it on to the future generations. 
  All our indigenous nationals should rely upon themselves in 
striving to remain as an independent nation in the world and to 
ensure perpetuation of sovereignty. Indigenous nationals are 
duty-bound to strive to collectively safeguard independence and 
sovereignty. They are to maintain their patriotic and 
nationalist fervor. 
  In the course of our history, the citizens of Myanmar have 
always repulsed and overcome attempts aimed at destroying the 
nation where the people have lived together through weal and 
woe. Furthermore, there are many instances showing that the 
citizens of Myanmar were capable of rising from the ruins by 
constructing anew. Therefore, in our era, we have been able to 
overcome the destructive elements and are constantly striving to 
engage in constructive endeavors. 
  We as a nation deserve independence and is capable of 
carrying out national construction and maintaining the national 
heritage. We stand as a nation in the international community. 
  The national government is implementing border region 
development schemes with momentum in the long-term interests of 
the fraternal indigenous people in the border regions. 
Currently, 10 indigenous organizations have given up the line 
of armed struggle and are participating in national construction 
tasks in accordance with the law. The threat of insurgency has 
been cleared in these areas and construction tasks are being 
implemented. 
  Currently, delegates are discussing the state constitution, 
which will ensure the rights and equal development for the Union 
nationals in accordance with their wishes at the National 
Convention, which opened at the beginning of 1993. The 
convention is systematically deliberating on various tasks, and 
it has already drawn up chapter headings for the constitution 
and the basic principles that should be incorporated into the 
constitution. More important matters have yet to be discussed 
in detail in the future. It is very important that the 
constitution be in accordance with the six objectives and the 
wishes of the people and that it ensure the future prosperity of 
the Union. 
  It is important for the delegates to carry out the duty of 
drafting the constitution and for all the citizens to give 
necessary assistance. That is why it is said that the drafting 
of the state constitution is as important as life. 
  The State Law and Order Restoration Council, which is 
leading 
the nation, had carried out the following tasks with the 
people's cooperation: 
  A. The three cardinal tasks -- nondisintegration of the 
Union; nondisintegration of national unity; perpetuation of 
sovereignty; 
  B. Prevalence of law and order and local peace and 
tranquility; 
  C. Smooth and secure transport and communications; 
  D. Easing the people's need for food, clothes, and shelter; 
  E. Priority and protection given to development tasks for 
all 
indigenous people throughout Myanmar. 
  Its achievements in working for peace and prosperity, 
political stability, and economic development in the country are 
known to the people. 
  The Union Solidarity and Development Association [USDA] has 
been formed with the objective of safeguarding and perpetuating 
the Union of Myanmar, promoting friendship among the indigenous 
people, perpetuating national sovereignty and territory, 
promiting national development, and emergence of a peaceful and 
modern state. It is necessary for the national people to study 
and scrutinize the changes in international and domestic 
situation and participate wholeheartedly in the association. 
  Presently, progress has been made in international relations 
and international trade. As the country's economic development 
accelerates, the momentum of success should be maintained, and 
more efforts should be made for development. Only then will the 
country emerge as a developed, peaceful, and modern state. It 
will be necessary for all the people to continue to cooperate 
and work with the SLORC to achieve this goal. Therefore, it is 
urged that the objectives of the 46th Independence Day be 
implemented. The four objectives being: 
  1. For all Union nationals to collectively safeguard and 
ensure the perpetuation of national independence and sovereignty; 
  2. The promotion of nationalism and patriotism; 
  3. Each citizen to strive to work for the emergence of the 
State Constitution; 
  4. To work with firm conviction, zeal, diligence, and 
tenacity for national development and emergence of a peaceful 
and modern nation.

  [Text] Two guerrillas belonging to a Burmese student 
rebel group have been killed in recent attacks by the Burmese 
army, a rebel source said yesterday. One of those killed was a 
battalion commander in the All Burma Students Democratic Front 
[ABSDF], said a member of the Karen National Union, an allied 
opposition group. 
  The two students were killed in attacks last Wednesday by 
three battalions, or 1,500 troops, of Burmese army in an area 
controlled by the Karen group about 100 kilometres north of its 
headquarters at Manerplaw, on the Thai border, said the Karen 
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Manerplaw is 
about 210 kilometres east of Rangoon. Another Karen official in 
Bangkok said combat continued at least through Friday, and 100 
Karen refugees from the fighting had crossed into Thailand.

  [Text] Malaysia is still not prepared to establish 
diplomatic relations with Israel. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed 
pointed out that many things have yet to be done by that country 
before it could be accorded recognition. 
  The prime minister said this at the news conference after a 
visit to Angkasapuri [Ministry of Information]. He hopes that 
Israel would make progress towards this end. Although he 
regarded the agreement between Israel and Palestine as an 
outstanding development, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir felt that the 
agreement alone is not adequate. This is because there is no 
declaration on the part of Israel for a Palestinian state. 
Besides, there is no declaration from Israel that they will not 
resort to terrorism in effort to achieve its national objective. 
Whereas the Palestinians are required not to use terrorism. 
  Malaysia has to wait before it takes action to accept the 
state of Israel. The prime minister also warned that the problem 
is still not over due to the attitude of the Gulf states 
themselves which are at loggerheads with each other. The 
situation has resulted in some parties not supporting the accord.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Fri -- The nation's inflation rate has 
dropped another 0.1 per cent from 3.7 per cent as at the end of 
October to 3.6 per cent at the end of last month. 
  Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Datuk Abu 
Hassan 
Omar said today that the reduction was proof that the 
government's efforts to curb inflation had been effective with 
the help of the public and the business community. 
  He, however, said the government was still not satisfied 
with 
the 3.6 per cent inflation rate achieved so far and his ministry 
would continue its efforts to bring down the rate further. 
  The country's inflation rate stood at 3.9 per cent from 
January until July this year, dropping to 3.8 per cent at the 
end of August and stayed at 3.7 per cent at the end of September 
and October. 
  As for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Abu Hassan said the 
index for food was now 33.7 per cent, gross rent, fuel and power 
(20.2 per cent), transport and communication (18.6 per cent), 
beverages and tobacco (4.3 per cent, clothing and footwear (four 
per cent), furniture, furnishing and household equipment and 
operations (5.8 per cent) medical care and health expenses 1.8 
per cent, recreation, entertainment, education and cultural 
services (5.2 per cent) and miscellaneous goods and services 
(6.4 per cent). 
  (The CPI measures the average rate of change in prices of a 
fixed pattern of an average household in Malaysia with 1990 as 
the base year.) 
  He said his ministry was responsible only to bring down the 
food index and other sectors, whether government agencies or the 
private sector, had a role to ensure the CPI was further reduced. 
  Speaking at a year-end press conference at his Menara 
Maybank 
[Maybank Towers] office here Abu Hassan said his ministry would 
continue to take the lead in the fight against inflation next 
year. 
  Asked how far the ministry hoped to reduce the rate of 
inflation next year, Abu Hassan said, "The prime minister 
himself, as head of the Cabinet Committee on Inflation, had said 
that the government's objective is to achieve zero inflation 
rate. It is not impossible. The private sector can help the 
government reduce the current inflation rate further by 
increasing efficiency and reducing production costs thus 
enabling the price of goods to remain stable." 
  Abu Hassan also announced that his ministry would begin a 
major publicity campaign from April next year to enhance the 
people's awareness on the scourge of inflation. 
  Among the ministry's steps to curb inflation this year 
include the setting up of a price information centre to give 
consumers up-to-date information on prices of goods; holding a 
"fair price" shops competition and conducting price checks on 
business premises under "Ops Budget".

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan 3 (AFP) -- Malaysia Monday became 
the first country to have a fully fledged Islamic financial 
system with the launch of an interbank money-market that 
operates on an Islam-sanctioned profit-sharing concept. 
  "The launch of an Islamic interbank money market and 
cheque-clearing system completes the setting up of the world's 
first full-fledged Islamic financial system in Malaysia," said 
Nor Mohamed Yakcop, adviser to the central bank, Bank Negara. 
  Predominantly Moslem Malaysia, he said, was also the only 
country to have a Moslem financial system that ran parallel to 
the conventional banking system practised by the West. 
  Many bankers, however, see the Moslem system as a sham to 
hide interest payments or "wiba" which are forbidden under 
Islamic law. 
  Nor said the launch capped a year of planning by the central 
bank to work out the financial instruments. 
  "The Islamic interbank money market operates on the basis of 
Al- Mudharabah or profit-sharing, which simply means that the 
provider of funds will earn a profit from his investments 
instead of being paid interest," he said. 
  Bankers also began Monday to trade in short-term bankers' 
acceptances on a profit-sharing basis. 
  The profit earned from the money lent would be shared 
between 
the provider and borrower on a ratio that could range from 
70:30, 80:20 or 90:10 depending on the loan-period, he said. 
  "The profit-sharing ratios will be liberalised by the 
central 
bank in due course when everybody is comfortable with the new 
system to allow the ratios to be negotiated between the 
investing and receiving institutions," he said. 
  The other countries which have an Islamic banking system are 
Pakistan, Iran and Sudan, but they do not have the conventional 
banking system and an Islamic interbank money market facility. 
  Indonesia, which has an Islamic banking system running 
alongside the conventional banking practices, also does not have 
an interbank money market facility, Nor said. 
  Bankers say the Malaysian development is a significant move 
that should be emulated by other Moslem countries to stem the 
large outflow of funds from Islamic countries to non-Islamic 
banks in the West. 
  "It is an irony that some Islamic countries are borrowing 
substantially from non-Islamic institutions in the West, while 
other Islamic countries are depositing funds with them," said 
central bank governor Jaffar Hussein. 
  "The western non-Islamic banks are just recyling funds 
belonging to the Moslems to other Moslems and making a big and 
hefty profit in the process," Jaffar said recently. 
  Islamic banking in Malaysia was pioneered by the country's 
sole Islamic bank, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd, which was set up in 
1983. 
  Since then 20 other financial institutions in the country 
have adopted the Islam-sanctioned banking facilities alongside 
conventional banking. 
  Bankers see the difference between the Moslem banking 
practice and the conventional banking system as "pure cosmetic." 
  "Under Islamic banking, the bank lends you money, but in a 
slightly different way," said Bank Islam's managing director 
Halim Ismail. 
  "Take the common housing loan. The bank will buy the house 
on 
your behalf and then sells the house to you at a price which 
includes the cost and a margin of profit, but still allows you 
to make deferred payments." 
  "That extra amount that you pay will be more or less equal 
to 
the extra amount that you will pay when borrowing from 
commercial banks," Halim said.

<F P=106> [By Anna Teo] </F>
  [Text] Singapore -- Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong yesterday 
delivered Singaporeans splendid news in his New Year message: 
The economy did well in 1993, growing 9.8 percent and attracting 
a record $3.9 billion [Singapore dollars] in manufacturing 
investments. The 9.8 percent expansion, the strongest annual 
growth since 1988, would mean an unexpectedly strong 
fourth-quarter spurt of around 12 percent, going by the 
preliminary estimate of about 9 percent for the first nine 
months of last year. 
  The Ministry of Trade &amp; Industry in mid-November last 
year 
forecast 1993 growth of close to 9 percent, a figure which the 
private sector has since set its sights on. Growth last year 
was broad-based, and for the first time in five years, 
productivity grew faster than real wages, said Mr Goh. 
  The strong flow of investment commitments last year, 
surpassing the 1992 volume of $3.5 billion, confirms that 
Singapore remained competitive despite a sluggish world economy 
and China's strong pull, he said. But the overall average last 
year was pushed up by the exceptional performance of the 
financial and business services sector, especially the stock 
market, Mr Goh noted. 
  Also, there are some signs that the manufacturing sector is 
slowing down, which Singapore should watch carefully, he added. 
  Still, 1994 looks promising with the world economy 
improving, 
and Singaporeans can look forward to another good year, the PM 
said. MTI is sticking to its earlier forecast of 1994 growth at 
between 6 and 8 percent. 
  With the NAFTA Bill approved in Congress, and the Uruguay 
Round of trade talks wrapped up, there is now a positive and 
improving global trading environment, he said. Economic 
recovery and steady growth in the U.S., Europe and Japan this 
year will pull other countries along. Except for Japan, growth 
in the Asia-Pacific will remain buoyant, and Singapore will 
benefit from the regional boom. Singapore must seek and seize 
the opportunities by participating in the region's growth, he 
said. 
  Turning to the longer term, Mr Goh said one problem 
Singapore 
should pay more attention to is its rapid ageing population. 
  "This ageing population will have serious implications for 
our economic vigour and competitiveness," he said. "We need to 
make major adjustments to cope with this change." 
  Singapore has taken several steps -- raising the retirement 
age to 60, getting Singaporeans to exercise and stay healthy, 
getting them to save for old age -- but more still needs to be 
done. The subject will be discussed in greater depth this year, 
said Mr Goh. 
  While Singapore is not the only country with the problem, 
its 
population is ageing much faster than elsewhere because births 
have declined sharply after the post-war baby boom, the Prime 
Minister said. Typical Western countries take 50 years or more 
for the proportion of elderly above 65 to double from 10 to 20 
percent, but Singapore will take only about 20 years. 
Furthermore, Singapore's edge of a substantially younger 
population, compared with the developed countries, will narrow 
and will eventually almost disappear in the next few decades. 
  Over the next 40 years, the Singapore population is 
projected 
to grow 30 percent from 2.7 million to 3.5 million, but the 
number of people above 65 years will jump by three times from 
164,000 to 662,000. 
  "Provided we prepare early for what lies ahead, we can 
surmount this challenge, as we have many other challenges in the 
past," said Mr Goh.

  [Text] Singapore will eliminate tariffs on 406 products as 
part of the concessions on the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT). The elimination of these 406 tariffs will mean 
that more than $2.5 billion [Singapore currency] worth of 
imports annually will be able to enter Singapore duty-free from 
tomorrow. The duty foregone from these imports is estimated at 
$60 million. 
  The products include birds' eggs, candy, biscuits, 
artificial 
sweeteners, clothing, flourescent tubes, headgear, leather 
handbags, imitation jewellery and furniture. The huge GATT 
accord, formally approved on Dec 15 by 114 nations, is expected 
to eliminate trade barriers and lower tariffs around the world. 
For the first time, there will be rules to govern trade in 
agriculture, textiles and services. 
  Protection of intellectual property rights wll be 
strengthened, barriers to foreign investment levelled and a new 
World Trade Organization set up to police the new deal. The 
agreement is widely expected to stimulate more trade, thereby 
pulling world economies out of recession and promoting new jobs. 
Trade is also being liberalised in ASEAN under the AFTA 
agreement. Under the plan, intra-regional tariffs on all 
manufactured and processed products will be capped at 5 percent 
by the year 2008.

<F P=106> [Statement by unidentified National Army of Democratic </F>
Kampuchea spokesman on 2 Janaury; place not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] On 31 December French radio reported that puppet Hun 
Sen and other leading Vietnamese communist puppets in Phnom Penh 
mendaciously announced to everybody that they had captured 
Anlung Veng on 30 December. The spokesman of the National Army 
of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] would like to totally reject this 
vicious propaganda claim by puppet Hun Sen and other leading 
Vietnamese communist puppets. 
  What is the reason for this fabrication by the Vietnamese 
communist puppets in Phnom Penh? 
  1. It is to scare those who do not know the truth, and it is 
aimed at undermining the king's national reconciliation effort. 
  2. It is to boost the morale of their soldiers who are badly 
dispirited, combat weary, and mutinous against their commanders 
everywhere. 
  3. It is to deceive others in their show of hollow force 
against the masses, the students, the teachers, and other 
residents in Phnom Penh who are revolting against the Vietnamese 
communist regime and the two-headed, three-eyed administration 
both in Phnom Penh and the provinces; and so on. 
  As a matter of fact, however, the masses and the people have 
seen through that lie. 
  One thing that everybody admits as true is that the 
Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and their alliance have 
been attacking the people and Democratic Kampuchea. They have 
been attacking us all the time, both on the battlefield and in 
their psychological propaganda activities. 
  1. More than 200,000 Vietnamese communists attacked 
Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian people for 13 years. 
  2. After the signing of the Paris agreement, the alliance 
both inside and outside the UN Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia [UNTAC] joined hands with the Vietnamese communists and 
their puppets in attacking Democratic Kampuchea. 
  3. Immediately after the formation of the provisional 
two-headed government in July 1993, the Vietnamese communists, 
the alliance, and their puppets launched attacks against 
Democratic Kampuchea and the people, particularly at Phnum Chhat 
and in Stoung. And after the adoption of the Constitution and 
formation of the so-called legal two-headed government, they 
again have begun attacking Democratic Kampuchea and the people. 
  Although the king entreats: Children, you should be 
reconciled with one another; the people say: Let us be 
reconciled; and the world community urges: Cambodians, be 
reconciled; but the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and 
their alliance keep shouting: Fight! Fight! Fight! 
  The truth is that hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese 
communists have been attacking and slaughtering the Cambodian 
people and Democratic Kampuchea for the past 13, 14, or 15 
years; the Vietnamese communist puppets have been serving the 
Vietnamese communists for the past 13, 14, or 15 years; and 
UNTAC came in to help them for another 18 months. 
  The Cambodian nation and people, like the world people at 
large, have seen and heard about the defeats of these warmongers 
bent against peace and national reconciliation. Most are of the 
opinion that the more they struggle and writhe, the firmer and 
tighter they become fastened. The ones who are holding onto the 
noose around their necks are not Democratioc Kampuchea nor the 
Khmer Rouge; it is the Cambodian people, the students, the 
teachers, and the soldiers who are opposed to the aggressor 
Vietnamese communist regime and are jointly supportive of the 
king's national reconciliation policy.

<F P=106> [28 December message from PDK President Khieu Samphan to </F>
Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, chairman of the FUNCINPEC 
party, in response to the latter's 24 December message to Khieu 
Samphan via the the PDK office in Phnom Penh -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] To His Royal Highness Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, chairman of the National United Front for an 
Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia 
[FUNCINPEC] party, Phnom Penh 
  Your Highness Prince Krompreah: I have received a letter 
dated 24 December 1993 graciously sent to me by your highness 
via the office of the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] in 
Phnom Penh. 
  Your highness expressed the view when you graciously granted 
me an audience on 17 December that the current situation 
required all the national forces, including your highness and 
myself, to meet frequently to discuss and exchange views with 
one another under different forms so that together we could 
solve the serious problem facing our Cambodian nation and 
community. Agreeing with this excellent concept, I and the 
entire PDK were very pleased when your highness graciously 
accepted that a technical group should be set up in response to 
my request in order to make it possible for frequent but 
comprehensive talks to be held on all issues without any 
preconditions. In addition, your highness graciously stated 
that the five-point political guideline put forth by his majesty 
the king constitutes the basis for the consultations of this 
technical group. 
  I am confident that all of our nation and blood brothers in 
the countryside and the cities, at home and abroad, will 
joyously welcome this excellent development, because it is a 
step toward national reconciliation, national unity, and the 
rallying of all national forces in line with the enlightened 
initiative of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, the 
august, lofty leader of our nation. I believe that, in order to 
make the consultations between your highness and myself more 
advanced and fruitful, we should adhere to the above basis and 
go into greater detail and depth in accordance with the 
prevailing situation of our country and the sacred aspiration of 
our nation and people. 
  I also beg your permission to use this opportunity to inform 
your highness once again that the PDK welcomes and fully 
supports without any preconditions his majesty's five-point 
political guideline graciously put forth by the king in his 
capacity as a Cambodian citizen in an essay on 21 November 1993. 
  In these five-point proposals his majesty the king demands 
that the factions give concessions to each other and hold 
discussions, consultations, and working meetings on that basis. 
The PDK has always been prepared to honor this excellent royal 
instruction, and will do everything in its power to completely 
accomplish the king's political guideline as soon as possible. 
We have this stance because we firmly believe that this royal 
political guideline will surely bring about national 
reconciliation, national unity, and the rallying of all national 
forces -- with none rejected. Besides, we hold that the 
political guideline that his majesty the king has provided for 
all Cambodian leaders and for our nation and people stems from 
his profound meditation and reflection on how to cope with the 
prevailing situation, which requires that all national forces 
take part in all fields and sectors of state affairs, jointly 
helping to redress the worsening situation and responding to the 
desire of our entire nation and people. 
  As I have already informed your highness, if supported by 
all 
national forces, this five-point political guideline of our king 
will become the second royal crusade, opening up for his majesty 
the king another opportunity to fulfill a noble mission for our 
Cambodian nation and people and giving the latter total 
independence and sovereignty in their territorial integrity -- 
the sacred goal of our nation and people. 
  Based on all the above reasons, it is my opinion that we 
should make arrangements so that the technical group, set up in 
the spirit of the consensus reached between your highness and 
myself on 17 December 1993, can gradually begin to function and 
provide discussions and consultations on the basis of his 
majesty our august king's five-point political guideline with a 
view to implementing it on every point. So long as we have a 
chance to discuss and hold working meetings on such a specific 
and correct basis, and with the august instructions graciously 
given by his majesty as a beacon to help light up and steer our 
way, we will surely succeed in progessively solving the problems 
until we have fully carried out his majesty our venerated king's 
political guideline. Then, there will be national 
reconciliation, national unity, the rallying of all national 
forces, and peace as a positive response to the profound and 
sacred aspiration of our entire nation and people. 
  I therefore ask permission to inform your highness of all 
the above. I have nothing against your highness at all. On the 
contrary, I myself and the PDK as a whole, who once worked along 
side your highness Prince Krompreah and the FUNCINPEC party in 
jointly fighting our national enemies, continue to support 
FUNCINPEC and seek by all means to offer your highness Prince 
Krompreah the full right to be the prime minister of a genuinely 
national royal government in accordance with the wish of our 
nation and people. 
  It is my belief that if we proceed in accordance with this 
guideline, there will be no more problems. As for the problem 
of who is attacking whom, I believe that this problem can also 
be solved when the five-point political guideline of his majesty 
our august king is fulfilled through actual implementation, 
because then the armed forces of all national forces will be 
integrated into a single Khmer Royal Armed Forces, with the king 
as the supreme commander. Concerning this problem, I already 
informed your highness in person of what really happened during 
our meeting on 17 December 1993. 
  Moreover, I ask permission to sincerely inform your highness 
that, during the past few months as well as at the present, 
there has been a lot of political propaganda and military 
activity aimed at destroying the forces of Democratic Kampuchea. 
In the provinces of Preah Vihear, Kompong Thom, Siem Reap, and 
Oddar Meanchey the forces of the former National Army of 
Independent Cambodia [the Sihanoukist ANKI forces] have been 
drawn up to join other armed forces in launching large-scale 
offensives in attempts to attack and destroy the forces of 
Democratic Kampuchea, such as those at Stoung and Phnum Chhat in 
August and at Anlung Veng at the beginning of last October. 
Since late-December another large-scale offensive to attack the 
forces of Democratic Kampuchea has also been launched. 
  I ask your permission to raise this issue in order to show 
your highness Prince Krompreah that the situation is very 
complex and its solution requires joint efforts, just as his 
majesty our august king has most wisely pointed out. 
  I take this opportunity to assure your highness that the PDK 
and the national army of Democratic Kampuchea support your 
highness and the FUNCINPEC party as a whole, including both its 
military and political apparatuses. This support stems both 
from our tradition of joint struggle and, more importantly, from 
our understanding that in order for our Cambodian nation and 
race to survive all national forces must rally around the throne 
and the king with the FUNCINPEC party, which advocates national 
reconciliation playing the main role as in the times of Sangkum 
Reas Niyum under the leadership of his majesty the king. I 
understand that this is also the wish and desire of our entire 
nation and people. It was for this reason that our blood 
brothers gave their votes of confidence to your highness Prince 
Krompreah and the FUNCINPEC party. And it was for the same 
reason that the PDK supported the election results and has 
demanded that arrangements be taken to fully comply with these 
election results; and the PDK continues to strictly maintain 
this position. 
  Humbly yours, 
  [Dated] 28 December 1993 
  [Signed] Khieu Samphan, president of the PDK

  [Text] The General Staff of the Khmer Royal Armed Forces 
[KRAF]: 
  The Democratic Kampuchea faction should have been aware that 
between September and October 1993 more than 3,000 of its 
officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers returned to 
the national fold, enjoying both the moral and material 
assistance of the royal government under the leadership of His 
Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman. 
  These gentlemen have now loyally joined the national 
community and been inducted as KRAF officers, non-commissioned 
officers, and soldiers under the leadership of our venerated 
king father. For this reason, those of you who are officers, 
non-commissioned officers, and soldiers still suffering under 
the command of the Khmer Rouge recalcitrants, who continue to 
use you as a shield to die and become disabled in their place, 
should stop following the dark road of the Khmer Rouge leaders 
and rebel against and attack these stubborn leaders and return 
to the national community. 
  The General Staff appeals to you to hurry in order to avoid 
the upcoming confrontations. Return to the national community 
and you will be rewarded with positions, duties, and ranks 
commensurate with your individual capabilities and achievements. 
All KRAF units positioned throughout the country and nearby 
competent authorities are waiting to welcome you with cordiality 
and sincerity. They will consider you faithful and loyal to the 
country, religion, and the king. 
  [Signed] General Ke Kimyan, chief of the General Staff of 
the 
KRAF

<F P=106> ["Clarification" issued by King Norodom Sihanouk on 2 </F>
January] 
  [Text] Yesterday and today, that is on 1 and 2 January, 
BBC television carried an important report on the restriction of 
press freedom in Cambodia, including a threat by the government 
threat against any newspapers and journalists criticizing King 
Norodom Sihanouk. 
  Concerning this matter, I, Norodom Sihanouk, would like to 
emphasize again that there has been no punishment nor arrest of 
any journalist or newspaper for criticizing, attacking, 
insulting, or slandering me. No one has been arrested, 
threatened, or accused because of me. Moreover, no courts will 
examine nor make judgment on any newspaper or journalist because 
of me. 
  In the case that there is any unfair or incorrect report in 
newspapers affecting me, all I will do is make a clarification 
like this one. 
  I would like to stress again that national and international 
newspapers, radios, and televisions in Cambodia enjoy 
100-percent full freedom. Cambodia's liberal democratic system 
in the 1990's, at present, and in the future is as free as the 
liberal democracy in France, the United Kingdom, Australia, the 
United States, and other countries in the Western world. 
  [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk

  [Text] Jakarta, Dec 29 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Seven East Timorese 
students seeking asylum in the embassies of Sweden and Finland 
last June here were reported to live in Lisbon. 
  They have been allowed to leave Indonesia and live in 
Portugal. "If they want to move to other countries, why should 
we prevent them," said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
spokesman, Irawan Abidin, here on Wednesday. 
  The seven shudents who visited the embassies on June 23 to 
seek for asylum are Florencio Anunciacio Fernandes (22), 
Veofirio Coasta Oliveira (23), Jose Manuel De Oliveira Sousa 
(24), Mateuscito Ximenes (23), Ventura Valentim (25), Clementino 
Farias (27) and Oscar Goncalvessja Silva (20). 
  The university students left Indonesia at 2.30 p.m. by 
Singapore Airlines at the Portuguese Government's expense. 
  Last August, the Indonesian Government allowed 28 East 
Timorese to leave for Portugal for reunion with their relatives. 
Twenty two others are still waiting for permission to go to 
Portugal.

  [Text] The Indonesian Government's decision to allow seven 
East Timorese students to leave for Lisbon should not be 
questioned. Susilo Sudarman, coordinating minister for politics 
and security affairs, said this to reporters after attending a 
coordinated meeting on politics and security in Jakarta 
yesterday. The seven students, who had tried to obtain 
political asylum at the Swedish and Finnish Embassies on 23 
June, left the country for Portugal via Jakarta's Sukarno-Hatta 
Airport yesterday. The students received travel arrangement 
assistance from the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
  As for the letter smuggled out of Jakarta's Cipinang prison 
by Xanana Gusmao, leader of East Timor GPK [Security Disturbance 
Movement], Susilo Sudarman said relevant authorities are now 
investigating the matter. The letter, which had been published 
in Portuguese media, called on the Portugese Government to help 
release him from jail.

  [Text] Dili, E. Timor, Jan 03 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Former East 
Timor governor Mario Viegas Carrascalao said that a camp backing 
the East Timor security disturbance group leader Xanana Gusmao 
has exploited the spirit of Christmas and the new year to 
attract the attention of the international community. 
  "They intentionally circulated the letter, in which Gusmao 
had sought the Portuguese Government and UN Law Commission's 
help to obtain freedom and repatriation to Portugal, to the 
international community with the hope that he be freed on 
Christmas day," he told ANTARA here on Sunday. 
  Carrascalao said they had timed the release of the letter on 
the belief that Christians would be more sympathetic during 
Christmas and the new year. 
  "They hoped to corner Indonesia by playing on the world's 
sympathy during the religious season," he added. 
  Commenting on the authenticity of the letter, he said it was 
not that important to determine if Gusmao's letter was indeed 
genuine because it would not have an impact on the country. 
  "Whether Gusmao had written the letter or not, they would 
have engineered anything to lure the international sympathy," 
he added. 
  The letter is being investigated to ascertain its 
genuineness. 
  Presently the Indonesian ambassador to Romania, Carrascalao 
said those who backed Gusmao and his anti-integration group from 
Darwin, Sydney and several Portuguese cities had "kitchens" to 
cook up "any materials" to discredit Indonesia. 
  He noted that these supports such as the one led by leading 
activist Ramos Horta were well organised. 
  "It was possibbe and easy for them to forge Gusmao's 
handwriting and signature," he added. 
  News about Gusmao had faded since he was transferred to 
Jakarta's Cipinang correctional institution, said Carrascalao, 
adding that the distance forced his backers to think twice 
before raising the issue. 
  Carrascalao said if the probe concluded that the letter was 
leaked by Gusmao himself, it proved that Indonesia had treated 
the convicted leader well. 
  "It goes to show that the government has given Xanana Gusmao 
a lot of space to conduct his daily chores such as writing 
letters," he added. 
  Gusmao was tried and sentenced to life imprisonment in May 
last year by the East Timor court in Dili. 
  President Suharto granted him clemency and converted his 
life 
sentence to 20 years in jail.

<F P=106> [Speech by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet at the opening of the </F>
fourth session of the Ninth National Assembly in Hanoi on 6 
December] 
  [Text] Dear Presidium and delegates: You must have copies 
of those government reports on its plans and state budget to be 
presented before the National Assembly. These reports review the 
implementation of those tasks set forth by the National Assembly 
in its second session for 1993, evaluate the first three years 
of implementing the five-year 1991-95 plan, present the course 
of socioeconomic development for the two remaining years, 
especially for the year 1994. The National Assembly will hear 
supplementary reports on national defense and security, on 
foreign relations, on mountain area socioeconomic development, 
on the enforcement of the new wage system, and on the fight 
against corruption and smuggling. 
  The report I am presenting before the National Assembly for 
consideration will further provide an analysis of a number of 
assessments and major policies. 
  I. Urgent requirements and ability to enter a new stage of 
socioeconomic development: 
  1. In 1993, we have continued to further develop the 
achievements of 1992, and fulfilled and exceeded all major 
targets set by the second session of the Ninth National Assembly 
in its resolution on tasks for 1993. 
  Generally speaking, in the three years from 1991-93, the 
average annual gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 7.2 
percent, which was higher than planned in the five-year 1991-95 
plan. 
  In agricultural production, although there were a number of 
areas stricken by natural calamities each year, we were still 
able to achieve our development targets. In 1993 alone, extended 
drought, typhoons, and floods occured in many central region 
provinces, but the country was still* able to increase its 
agricultural production output to 24.5 million tons of food 
grain, thus attaining the target set forth for the year 1995 
[year as published]. In those areas stricken by natural 
disasters, prices continued to be stable, and production and the 
people's normal life were promptly restored. 
  The production of various industrial and service 
establishments belonging to different economic sectors have, in 
general, adjusted fairly well to the market system. The annual 
industrial production output increase was higher than planned. 
Export values and budget revenue rose at a rate higher than that 
of production growth. Economic relations with foreign countries 
expanded quickly. Balance of payment was improved, foreign 
currency inflow adequately met the import demands of those 
materials and goods needed for production and everyday life. 
Internal reserves have started to grow. Living standards of a 
bulk of the people have been improved. 
  The constant growth achieved by many economic sectors in 
various domains over the past three years shows that our economy 
now has come out of recession. 
  Along with the economic growth, inflation was dispelled as 
evidenced by the fact that the inflation rate for the first 11 
months of 1993 was merely 4 percent. It is certain that 
inflation will be at the single-digit level for the whole year. 
Smuggled goods had some impact on efforts to reduce inflation 
because they made the price of certain home-made industrial 
goods less competitive. However, the main factors leading to 
price stability were the growth of commodity production and 
circulation, improvements in the regulation and circulation of 
currency, and the increase in material reserves. This enables us 
to make interventions whenever there is an unexpected market 
upheaval. Although there are still unstable factors such as 
great budget overdraft and small foreign currency reserves, our 
inflation control ability, in general, shows greater 
improvements than before. 
  In the cultural and social field, although many important 
problems still remain to be solved, compared with preceding 
years, there were better improvements in the implementation of 
various programs -- such as the program to create employment, 
the program to popularize elementary education and to gradually 
improve educational qualities and the research and application 
of scientific and technological innovations, the program to 
expand radio and television broadcasting coverage, the epidemic 
control program, the program to develop physical education and 
sports, the program to do away with hunger and poverty, and the 
program to repay the kindness of those who sacrificed their 
lives for the country. 
  Generally speaking, we were able to overcome by a very 
significant step the socioeconomic crisis. Most notably, we 
overcame the economic recession, dispelled inflation, firmly 
maintained political stability in a very tough and challenging 
situation where there was no foreign financial aid and where the 
U.S. embargo was still in place. All these achievements have 
testified to the vitality and shrewdness of our Vietnamese 
nation and people, and to the fact that the renovation policy of 
our party and state has suited the reality of our country. These 
acheivements have also demonstrated our people's strengths and 
capability to achieve self reliance. 
  The success of the renovation process is inseparable from 
our 
multilateral and diverse external relations policy. This policy 
has won the sympathy and support from other countries and 
international organizations and has paved the way for the 
integration of our country into the world community. The image 
of a renovating Vietnam wishing to befriend all countries 
received worldwide welcome and high appraisal, thus creating 
favorable conditions for our international relations. 
  The following factors have further enhanced our position 
and strength and created the necessary conditions for a new 
stage of development: 
  A. A vast majority of our people trust and enthusiastically 
support the renovation undertaking, regarding this cause as 
their own because it works for the fulfillment of their goals. 
Because the economy is well-motivated, it has encouraged 
production and business activities across society. 
Socioeconomic activities have not been in completely good order 
or well organized. Nonetheless, we have succeeded in reviving 
the people's dynamism and creativity and eliminating the 
negative attitude created by the state subsidization system. 
This is a very important factor in development. 
  B. The development environment has enjoyed the following 
basic factors, which are more favorable: 
  -- First, we have maintained political stability; pursued a 
policy of peace, friendship, and cooperation; and broadened our 
relations with almost all the nations in the world. 
  -- Our success in checking inflation has created the 
conditions for stabilizing microeconomic activities and reduced 
the risks for development and investment projects. 
  -- Positive efforts have been made to amend and perfect our 
legal system. 
  C. The material conditions for development -- though still 
limited by the shortage of capital, technology, marketing, and 
infrastructure -- still represent a great potential that awaits 
future exploitation. 
  -- As far as our country is concerned, the economy has begun 
to show an increase in capital accruement. Between 1991 and 
1993, the ratio of investment capital generated by the national 
economy was 4.8, 6.9, and 12.7 percent respectively compared 
with the gross domestic product. This shows that we have 
successfully put an end to the decrease in investment capital 
accruement which occurred over the past few consecutive years. 
The sources of capital among the people that can be tapped to 
serve investment and development remain substantial (it is 
estimated that in 1993 this capital amounts to 20 trillion dong, 
of which 8 trillion dong has been used, mostly to cover housing 
development projects). Our new policies and lines have created 
a new stimulus in many sectors and occupational areas, 
especially agriculture and the rural economy, where the people's 
manpower and material resources play a key role. Along with the 
state-provided investment capital generated by the national 
economy and international development aid, we are now retaining 
more and more material reserves from previous years. It is 
possible that we can increase them quickly in the future. 
  Regarding the outside world, our ability to acquire capital 
and technology has grown quickly despite the impact of the U.S. 
trade embargo. The breakthrough in our credit ties with 
international financial institutions has strongly stimulated 
multilateral and bilateral international development aid. A 
total of 22 countries and 17 international organizations sent 
delegations to the recent Paris conference of Vietnam's aid 
donor countries. These countries and international 
organizations pledged to provide our country with 1.86 billion 
U.S. dollars in development aid in the 1993-94 fiscal year. 
Direct foreign investment has continued to increase. It is 
noteworthy that foreign investment capital for 1993 reached 
about 800-850 million U.S. dollars, twice the amount invested in 
1992. The current pace of foreign investment capital inflow 
depends mainly on our ability to receive and make effective use 
of it. 
  The above-mentioned factors present tremendous opportunities 
for development. Opportunity does not come spontaneously. It 
comes through the personal efforts of our entire party and 
people together with the trends of peace, stability, and 
cooperation in the region and other parts of the world. 
Opportunity would not have brought us success if we had not 
seized it and developed it in time. 
  2. The new stage of development requires an effort to grasp 
opportunities and the ability to understand clearly those 
weaknesses, difficulties, and obstacles that must be overcome. 
  A. Our economy is still rife with many factors of 
instability; this could lead to upheavals. 
  Slow efforts have been made to improve the quality of the 
socioeconomic infrastructure, which, in some cases, has 
deteriorated. The savings and investment rates are still low. 
A substantial part of the people's potential has not been 
tapped or developed into productive activities. Public assets 
and state investment funds are being embezzled or seriously 
wasted. 
  The work force has not yet been brought into full play. 
Economic efficiency is still low, thus limiting the sources of 
investment capital and material reserves as well as our ability 
to improve the people's standard of living. 
  Our market economy is still in the nascent stage. It has 
not developed fully and has not been managed in a satisfactory 
way. This is because our legal system is not yet unified, and 
our abilities and efficiency in macromanagement do not meet 
requirements. Moreover, weaknesses and negativism are still 
prevalent in our administration, financial, and banking systems 
as well as in the state-run business sector. Corruption and 
smuggling persist and inflation may return. 
  B. Many social changes have been slow, and there are still 
many tough issues that remain a source of public concern, 
especially unemployment. Social vices and crime have been on 
the increase. A considerable number of people are accumulating 
wealth illegally, while many honest people and those with 
meritorious national deeds are facing difficulty in their 
livelihood. 
  C. Now entering the in-depth phase, renovation is growing 
comprehensive and is experiencing more difficulties. Those with 
vested interests have been affected. At the same time, 
renovation requires higher revolutionary awareness and better 
leadership and management knowledge. 
  Corruption, ineptitude, a poor sense of organization and 
discipline, and bureaucracy among a considerable number of 
cadres in many state agencies and organizations at various 
sectors and echelons -- in both the administrative and trading 
sectors -- are negating many policies. They are hampering and 
undermining renovation and reducing the people's confidence. 
They are a challenge to the party leadership and the state 
management. 
  Meanwhile, external and internal hostile forces are seeking 
to sabotage us. They have not missed any opportunity to weaken 
our internal ranks further. 
  To prevent internal disorder and external manipulation, it 
is 
inevitable that we must overcome our subjective shortcomings in 
leadership and management and the corruption and ineptitude of 
our contingent of cadres. 
  3. The greatest challenge to our nation and regime is slow 
economic development. Poor economic performance will leave our 
country further behind. We will remain weak and uncompetitive 
and lose out on international cooperation. In the current 
world, where the brutal economic race is emerging as the most 
important issue, further economic decline may lead to political 
and social instability and may constrain our efforts to 
consolidate our national defense and security and protect our 
independence and sovereignty. 
  To meet this challenge, we must promptly seize and make full 
use of any opportunity to dispel danger. We must carry out 
socioeconomic development at a quick and steady pace to build a 
prosperous people, powerful country, and an equal and civilized 
society. We must strive to narrow the development gap with 
neighboring countries. These are the people's aspirations and 
pressing demands. These will also determine the durability of 
our regime, guarantee national development in accordance with 
socialist objectives and orientations, and foil enemy schemes 
and actions to undermine and violate our national sovereignty. 
  The only way to achieve this is to continue to accelerate 
the 
renovation process, both in scope and intensity. We must 
further develop a sense of independence, mastery, and 
self-reliance; practice thrift for national construction and 
defense; and broaden international cooperation. Only by 
developing our internal strengths to the full can we attract and 
make satisfactory use of our external resources for quick 
development. Waiting for and relying on external assistance 
will lead us into a state of dependence and restrain national 
growth. This is not an understood principle, but reality has 
proven it to be true. 
  What can we draw on from the above analysis? The conclusion 
is that in 1994, we can and must open a new era of socioeconomic 
development in our country. The future GNP growth rate must not 
be less than 8 percent a year. We must try to double our 1990 
GNP by the year 2000, so that the conditions will be set and the 
momentum generated for more rapid national development as the 
country enters the 21st century. 
  In previous years, we had to concentrate our efforts on 
overcoming economic recession and inflation and achieving social 
and political stability. From the beginning of 1994, although 
we will still be concerned about stability, we will also have 
the conditions to allow us to focus our efforts on accelerating 
economic development and producing more drastic social changes 
to improve the people's material and spiritual lives. There 
will be more opportunities for us to consolidate political 
stability and strengthen national defense and security. This is 
the way to bring our country through its socioeconomic crisis so 
that it can enter into stable and steady development. In 
leadership and management, we must not concentrate on resolving 
urgent and unexpected issues. Instead, we must resolve 
fundamental and strategic issues to spur the restructuring of 
the economy toward industrialization and modernization in order 
to attain rapid economic growth with higher results and achieve 
better social order, justice, and progress. 
  Our socioeconomic development course for the next two years 
and our plan for 1994 are based on that spirit. Here, I would 
like to clarify further a number of major issues. I will also 
emphasize each issue that requires deep understanding or a new 
approach. 
  II. What should be done to ensure quick and long-lasting 
economic growth? 
  1. Accelerate investment and development and gradually shift 
the economic structure toward industrialization and 
modernization. 
  In the past three years, total investment in the entire 
society has reached 68.8 trillion dong. Investment is expected 
to be about 41 trillion dong in 1994, an increase of 32 percent 
over 1993. In 1995, it will reach about 52 trillion dong. 
Total investment in five years may equal or exceed the target 
outlined in the 1991-95 socioeconomic strategy plan extending to 
the year 2000. It will create a prerequisite for economic 
development and the improvement of employment in our society. 
  A. What are the capital resources for investment? 
  The most fundamental and important capital resource is 
domestic savings and reserves. 
  All those who care for the country and uphold the national 
tradition are aggravated by violations of the public property 
and lavish expenditures by agencies and state-run enterprises as 
well as in society. These practices should be condemned, 
especially when our country is still poor, our people's standard 
of living is low, and our national reserves are minimal. The 
government is responsible for formulating and implementing laws 
and policies to promote thrift and investment and oppose 
corruption and waste. In leading our nation into a new stage of 
development, we must formulate measures, mobilize the work 
force, educate the people to make them realize our nation's 
important current position, and launch a mass movement to 
promote thrift and denounce embezzlement, waste, and 
prodigality. We must strive to create a psychological feeling 
in society that practices such as buying luxuries and spending 
lavishly on engagement and wedding parties, funeral services, 
and other feasts are acts that should be condemned rather than 
honored. 
  The following are the government's lines and policies on 
exploiting and using capital investment resources in the years 
ahead: 
  -- There is great latent potential in capital resources 
among 
the people and economic units. This is an effective source of 
investment that needs to be exploited with suitable policies to 
encourage savings for production investment. We should 
promulgate laws soon to encourage domestic investment with 
preferential conditions similar to those provided for foreign 
investment. We must implement various forms of shareholding; 
sell more promissory notes; enhance the capabilities of various 
enterprises in investment, including state-run enterprises; 
simplify regulations on business registration for all kinds of 
business establishments; and strengthen measures to promote 
investment and improve services. Efforts must be made to 
encourage domestic investment, especially in projects that do 
not need sophisticated equipment but can produce essential goods 
that meet market demands, thus making profit in a short period 
of time (these includes projects in food processing, hotels, 
tourism, and so forth). Efforts must also be made to increase 
the proportion of domestic capital in various projects and joint 
ventures signed with foreign countries. 
  We must quickly develop the capital market; reform, and 
improve the activities of the banking and financial system to 
mobilize idle money for savings accounts, insurance funds, 
bonds, and shares. We must increase investment credit 
resources, including government credit. We must quickly expand 
medium and long-term credit resources to meet the demands for 
capital for investments in development. We must also 
satisfactorily prepare conditions that will enable us to 
experiment with the setting up of stock markets, firstly, in Ho 
Chi Minh City and Hanoi. 
  -- Government investment sources include domestic reserves 
and bilateral and multilateral foreign aid for development 
(mostly consisting of concessional loans and some gratuitous 
aid). The foreign aid committed by the recent Paris conference 
is a benefit. However, we still have to settle old debts to 
clear the way for foreign credit. We should also realize all 
the difficulties and complications in using loans from this 
source. This is so that we can calculate loan effectiveness as 
well as our repayment capacity to avoid losses and inactivity. 
  -- Government capital from national budget allocations is 
reserved only for infrastructure projects where the investments 
cannot be redeemed. Increasingly, mutual credit organizations, 
partnerships, and shares in enterprises in different economic 
sectors are a source of investment capital. This investment 
system will be applied to the 1994 state plan. 
  To efficiently use government capital resources and to avoid 
loss and wastage, it is necessary to solve the following issues: 
  -- Investment projects must be well-planned and closely 
connected with long-term regional economic development planning. 
On that basis, government capital can be reasonably coordinated 
in a concentrated form, and its dilution avoided. This is the 
main duty of the State Planning Commission which it must carry 
out together with its reforms in organization working methods. 
  -- The management of investment capital must be 
strengthened. 
Construction prices must be adjusted to suit real conditions. 
Methods for bidding, planning, construction, and approval must 
be perfected. We should use foreign and domestic consultancy 
services in these areas. 
  -- The management structure of state capital investment 
should be reformed in conformity with experiences learned from 
the management of foreign concessional loans to our country. 
  -- Approved projects must be timely funded according to the 
progress in construction. Responsibility for material loss 
caused by the funding organ to construction projects must be 
clearly stated. 
  Direct foreign investment is the most important source of 
foreign capital, which is mainly attracted by a favorable 
investment environment that contains little risk, disturbance, 
and trouble. It is important to improve the investment climate. 
At the same time, we should have policies to attract foreign 
countries to invest in our preferential sectors and regions. 
Investment commitment should be closely supervised, especially 
in the transfer of technology and environmental protection. It 
is about time that we pay attention not only to investment 
attractions but also to how registered capital is utilized and 
how enterprises already in operation are managed. From now on, 
the main index for foreign investment will be its capital and 
the effects on the economy. 
  B. Investment orientations for improving the economic 
structure as an initial step toward national industrialization 
and modernization under the socioeconomic development strategy 
from now to the year 2000. 
  In the next two years, we must concentrate our efforts on 
the 
following tasks: 
  -- Strive to bring about prominent changes in the structure 
of agricultural production, and gradually industrialize 
agriculture and the rural economy in accordance with the party 
Central Committee's Fifth Plenum resolution. This should be 
carried out through the use of the people's capital and efforts 
under state guidance and support. Market demands at home and 
abroad and new and current production conditions have enabled us 
to become self-reliant while concentrating more efforts on 
improving agricultural production. All regions, especially 
mountainous and coastal areas, must strive to improve their 
production structure and develop their advantages to contribute 
to fighting poverty and hunger effectively. Effort must be made 
to provide more electricity to promote and accelerate 
agro-forestry-fishery processing industries at various levels. 
This will help improve the socioeconomic condition in rural 
areas, while building more agro-industrial economic models to 
strengthen the multisectoral economy. 
  -- We must attract foreign investment and encourage domestic 
investment to exploit and process natural resources covering 
bare hills and mountains, and develop export production and 
services to create more jobs. These are the main sources of 
capital for forming a new industrialized and modernized 
structure. 
  -- The state must concentrate its investment in 
infrastructure projects, especially in the electrical 
transmission system, land and railway routes, seaports and 
airports, water reservoirs, internal telecommunications; and 
scientific, industrial, cultural, and social research 
institutions as well as education and public health services. 
  -- We must conduct research, anticipate, and correctly pick 
key development areas for the future, so that timely and 
essential preparations for further development can be made. 
  -- We must manage, supervise, and strictly control the 
import 
of technical and technological equipment. The import of 
obsolete and expensive technical equipment for production 
especially those that pollute the environment must be strictly 
reviewed and controlled, especially when the state budget is 
used to buy such equipment. 
  -- Accelerate the planning process for major economic areas 
in three regions and develop the locomotive effect that 
stimulates development in other areas. Plans for each area 
should accomodate its full potential and advantages in close 
association with the activities of major economic areas. The 
state shall support and take priority in giving foreign gratuity 
to areas with difficulties, especially border areas and offshore 
islands, areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, and sites of the 
former revolutionary bases. The state shall also focus 
assistance on the building of socioeconomic infrastructure 
projects, while formulating appropriate mechanism and plans to 
help regions and localities exploit their capabilities for 
further development. 
  The government recently worked with localities that still 
have numerous difficulties in determining orientations for 
development, concentrating on a number of programs and 
objectives from now until the year 2000 aimed at overcoming 
poverty and underdevelopment, thereby creating a prerequisite 
for rapid development in the 21st century. 
  While carrying out national projects to improve electric, 
transportation, and communications network, provinces in the 
central coastal region should concentrate efforts on the 
following key projects: First, the preservation and planting of 
forest trees in close association with the settlement of nomads 
and protection of the environment. Second, the improvement and 
adjustment of crop patterns to avoid natural disasters, the 
planting of appropriate industrial crops on denuded hills, and 
promotion of the processing industry and development of 
livestock breeding on a larger scale. Third, the exploitation, 
raising, and processing of aquatic products in close association 
with the efforts to protect coastal areas and offshore islands. 
And fourth, the provision of sufficient water for agriculture, 
forestry, industry, and domestic use in rural areas. 
  Provinces in the Central Highlands should also concentrate 
their efforts on carrying out these projects (excluding the 
production of aquatic products). They should make more efforts 
to improve forestry, plant more industrial crops, strengthen 
livestock breeding, and promote processing industries. 
  The northern highland provinces need to concentrate on 
building a socioeconomic infrastructure with the support of the 
central government. This includes a transportation, power, 
water supply, and communications network; education and training 
facilities, especially boarding schools for ethnic children; 
tertiary education and research establishments; a public health 
care network from the tribes, hamlets, and villages up to 
districts and provinces; the transmission of radio and 
television programs; and the development of cultural and 
information services aimed at restoring and developing the 
unique cultural characteristics of ethnic peoples. 
  In economic development, we must improve the economic 
structure of planting, animal husbandry, industry, services, and 
skills according to the party Political Bureau resolutions, 
government decisions on socioeconomic development in mountainous 
areas, and Government Directive No. 525 on practical guidelines 
and policies. The highland provinces and districts must remain 
close to the grassroots level and review experiences in order to 
build their own economic development models that suit local 
conditions and ethnic characteristics. The government will 
choose the most difficult mountainous province and district to 
supervise directly and draw experiences. In early 1994, the 
government will work with localities in the Red River delta and 
the Mekong River delta to establish directions for their 
economic development. 
  2. Exploiting the potential and enhancing the work efficacy 
of economic sectors. 
  Uniform implementation of the multisector economic policy is 
a significant factor that greatly contributes to the success of 
renovation. We have to continue renovating and implementing 
effective mechanisms and policies on different economic sectors 
in a satisfactory manner, however, in order to unleash the 
production force completely. 
  A. As a poor and underdeveloped nation, and with the aim of 
building the national economy and ensuring the state's role in a 
macromanagement system, Vietnam must strive to guide and help 
the economic sectors develop further along a socialist 
orientation. Efforts must absolutely be made to develop 
state-run economic and business enterprises. It is necessary to 
say that state-run economic enterprises do not just include 
business establishments, but also financial and banking 
institutions as well as national reserves, land assets, and 
other state properties. We must have a panoramic view of the 
state-run economy in order to manage, preserve, and develop 
national assets effectively. Ownership of all national assets 
must be defined. We must urgently carry out the allocation of 
land and forests to peasant households, concretely resolve land 
problems in urban areas and zones used by enterprises, build 
houses for sale or rent, and sell or rent enterprises or other 
establishments that the state no longer wants to operate. These 
tasks must be performed in line with the government's uniform 
guidelines, and money derived from the sale or rental must be 
transferred to the state budget. 
  Although state-run enterprises have been reorganized even 
further, their structures are not rational and key sectors have 
not been properly integrated. Many state-run enterprises are 
too small, are equipped with outdated machinery, and are 
operating at very low efficiency. 
  Therefore, on the one hand, we must continue to arrange and 
correct those enterprises in a more urgent and resolute manner. 
We must differentiate public service enterprises -- which serve 
the common demand and benefit socioeconomic development, so the 
government needs to have appropriate structure and management 
systems -- from business enterprises whose existence and 
development depends completely on their business performance. 
  On the other hand, we need to continue developing state 
enterprises in some necessary sectors and domains, such as 
grassroots establishments and some production enterprises that 
require a large capital and high technology, especially in heavy 
industry. The government will concentrate on changing some 
state enterprises in key areas into strong economic 
organizations that compete strongly in the international market 
and enjoy high efficiency. This will provide important 
financial contributions to the state budget. These enterprises 
must be reorganized and connected with commercial banks, 
import-export companies, and national and international 
transport services to form major economic organizations. The 
important thing is that the connection must be based on mutual 
economic benefit, ownership relations, and development 
strategies; not on administration arrangements. State 
enterprises compete and cooperate with enterprises from other 
economic sectors. In the process of forming big economic 
corporations, enterprises from other economic sectors can join 
in the form of collective ownership. 
  For those enterprises no longer under state management, we 
should definitely settle them by transferring their ownership, 
lending out, merging with other establishments, or abolishing 
them. Realities at many agricultural units, forestry sites, 
trade and business establishments, and transport corporations 
show that the application of the contractual system and the 
transfer of some machinery and equipment to the workers at 
state-run enterprises have brought about remarkable economic 
results. 
  One of the most effective measures to create enthusiasm 
among 
workers, to overcome the condition that no one is responsible 
for state properties, and to oppose negativism is to introduce a 
shareholding system at state enterprises. This will allow civil 
servants and workers to share ownership at these establishments. 
To carry out this task, efforts must made to clearly define the 
proportions of shares to be held by the state, those for the 
workers, and those for sale to private organizations and 
individuals and to foreign businessmen, and so forth. The 
government has been slow in drawing practical experiences, 
formulating legal documents, and providing training and guidance 
to introduce the shareholding system to state enterprises. 
  By looking at actual situations, we now understand that the 
state management function over all enterprises, regardless of 
different forms of ownership, must be clearly detached from the 
ownership-related function over the state enterprises. All the 
ownership-related functions should be concentrated on a state 
organ responsible for the management of all public capital and 
property and representing the state ownership in public 
companies. This organ is also charged with the duty to select 
officials who will become government representatives in the 
management boards of public companies where the government has 
invested. Consequently, the structure allowing the management 
of government ministries and departments over economic 
enterprises and the confusion arising from state management 
function and ownership-related function and the discrimination 
between the central economy and the local economy will have no 
reason to exist. 
  B. Efforts must be made to renovate cooperatives, develop 
the economic autonomy of cooperative members, and strengthen new 
economic cooperation in the rural areas in accordance with the 
party Central Committee's Fifth Plenum resolution. We must 
review experiences to provide guidance and assistance to build 
and develop various appropriate economic cooperation at various 
sectors and occupations. 
  C. It is essential to abolish regulations banning or 
creating difficulties for individual and private trade. At the 
same time, we must strengthen law enforcement to oppose 
unregistered business, counterfeiting, tax evasion, or other 
illegal activities. 
  The law clearly clarifies all banned trades and services and 
those that need to obtain a license before operating. Besides 
this limit, all business investments meeting all regulated 
conditions, irrespective of individual or private business, only 
need to register for their business, provided that they will 
conduct their business as registered. 
  We must apply a credit policy that works on the 
socioeconomic 
result and repayment capacity and that does not discriminate 
against any economic sectors. Under that spirit, we will 
increase credit percentage to the collective economy, 
individuals, and private business, especially peasant households. 
  D. We must create a clear framework for healthy business 
operation and competition and strictly deal with illegal 
business practices from any economic sectors. We must reexamine 
all cases of trade monopoly so that we can apply measures to 
limit the bureaucratic practice in the provision of goods and 
services. 
  The government will provide favorable conditions and active 
support for the establishment of contingent of able businessmen 
of all levels, from the heads of a family business to managers 
of major corporations, considering this as a decisive factor to 
develop the economy in an active, efficient, and discipline 
manner. 
  3. Expanding Economic Relations with Foreign Countries. 
  We are enjoying new favorable conditions in international 
relations at present. However, in expanding and enhancing the 
efficiency of foreign trade, we must rely on production 
development in accordance with the open door economic structure 
while strengthening exports and diversifying trade relations 
with the outside world. 
  New prospects for attracting foreign capital and technology 
require intensive efforts to develop domestic potential and 
maintain close management if we are to welcome and use these 
sources of foreign capital satisfactorily. Meanwhile, we must 
increase our macromanagement abilities in an effort to avoid 
hasty investments, as this may lead to imbalances and renewed 
inflation. 
  We must continue to ensure that exports develop at a faster 
pace than the economy (which is expected to increase 20 percent 
by 1994 and 25 percent by 1995) while making gradual efforts to 
improve the range of exports. 
  The consumer market is emerging as a very important factor 
in 
production. Production in general -- and exports in particular 
-- must proceed from market demand. We must not turn out 
products before efforts are made to search for markets. 
  The increase in certain processed goods -- such as knitwear 
items, garments, and aquatic products -- is currently quite 
large. Yet some export-oriented products -- including mineral 
ores and farm produce -- are mainly raw. They continue to 
account for a large proportion of exports and have been exported 
through middlemen. There is still a lack of stable markets for a 
wide range of export-oriented goods. Therefore, increasing 
processing capabilities -- particularly for farm produce -- must 
be given top priority in our investment promotion policies, 
including the policy to promote foreign investment. From 1994 
on, we must map out and implement a plan to develop major export 
goods (with an annual export value exceeding $100 million). We 
must harmoniously tackle various issues, ranging from investment 
capital obtained from various sources to various state 
structural policies, and from production and exploitation to 
processing and consumption, in a gradual effort to create a 
steady source of customers in the world market. 
  Economic sectors and establishments must renovate their 
technology so they can turn out high-quality products (of all 
categories, designs, and packaging styles) at an attractive 
price for local and foreign markets. We must be very strict on 
quality standards for exports and in the observance of 
contracts, in an effort to maintain our credibility. The 
government will introduce administrative regulations governing 
those goods bearing the "Made in Vietnam" trademark. 
  Production establishments must improve their ability to 
approach markets in an effort to take the initiative in finding 
customers. We must develop the role of chambers of commerce and 
trade in support of various businesses. We must reorganize our 
work in statistical and economic information. Not only will 
this benefit leadership and management activities, but it will 
meet the needs of businessmen. We must broaden our activities 
in existing markets, restore our traditional markets (China, 
former Soviet republics, and East European countries), and 
explore new markets (such as the European, Middle East, African, 
and Latin American markets). We must prepare to enter the U.S. 
market when conditions permit. 
  To promote vigorous exports further, we must continue to 
renovate our management mechanism, narrow the range of products 
under quota management; reduce red tape, particularly in the 
granting of licenses; and promptly deal with fluctuations in the 
foreign exchange rate. Imports must be placed under tight 
control through the tariff policy, foreign exchange rate, 
customs controls, and other necessary administrative measures. 
Efforts to limit imports to protect local products must be 
carried out resolutely and constantly, both at entry points and 
on the local market. Measures must be taken against the 
smuggling of cheap imports, as this may cause stagnation in the 
sale of local products. It is important that local products 
meet highly diversified demands, suit the tastes of various 
consumers, and become increasingly competitive with foreign 
goods. 
  In the future, the number of foreign visitors entering 
Vietnam and overseas Vietnamese returning home to visit will 
grow rapidly. This requires the tourism-hotel sector to achieve 
extraordinary growth, both in terms of material conditions and 
service quality. In building new hotels, attention must be paid 
to mobilizing capital from domestic sources in various forms. 
Efforts must be made to shift hotels and guesthouses from 
various public organs and enterprises to the system of business 
accounting. We must renovate and upgrade a number of these 
facilities to travel lodges. 
  4. Renovating and improving the financial, monetary, and 
credit situation. 
  A. The 1994 budget faces great financial needs for 
investment, development, and solutions to social problems. As 
the volume of foreign investment capital increases rapidly, we 
must ensure there is sufficient domestic capital to match it. 
Therefore, we must follow a new approach to ensure budget 
equilibrium. State revenues, which come from domestic 
collections and nonrefundable international aid, must be used to 
meet regular spending, pay debts, and cover investment and 
development costs (in 1994, we will have to allot about 15 
percent of our state revenues for this purpose and probably more 
in subsequent years). Regarding the lack of additional state 
revenues to carry out investment and development plans, we must 
rely on capital borrowed from the people (let's increase the 
ratio of mid- and long-term loans step by step) and from foreign 
countries (from now on, let's apply only for long-term foreign 
loans at low interest rates to meet investment and development 
goals). Definite steps must be taken not to circulate new money 
to serve budgetary and credit purposes. Regarding those funds 
that the government has obtained from foreign countries at low 
interest rates to assist various projects -- including 
infrastructure projects -- which are likely to generate 
sufficient income to help pay back capital, they must be shifted 
to the form of state credit loans under which the beneficiaries 
are duty bound to make fair payments on both principal and 
interest. This is the only way to generate income to pay for 
foreign debts. 
  By the way, it is worth saying something about the amount of 
foreign debt now due. These are relatively enormous figures. 
They include loans we had to borrow to make up for spending 
under the state subsidization mechanism, namely materials for 
production, grain, and certain kinds of consumer products. 
Regarding foreign loans to import equipment, a number of 
production installations have made good use of these loans. 
Generally speaking, however, some of those loans have generated 
insignificant results, while others have not been put to use 
yet. To pay for our debts, we do not have any alternatives 
other than making efforts to develop our economy and improve its 
performance. Therefore, it is necessary to make use of all 
kinds of new loans at low interest rates and work out tight 
management measures to guarantee effective use, thus helping 
make the economy stronger and capable of generating income to 
pay for both old and new debt, increase state revenue, and 
improve the standard of living. Immediate measures, however, 
must be taken to end the unhealthy situation in which we fail to 
exert close control and management over the application for 
foreign loans by the various sectors and localities, as well as 
to the bad practice of many foreign loan beneficiaries who, once 
they are unable to pay their debts, shift the entire burden to 
the state. 
  Efforts must be made to improve the tax collection system, 
reduce tariffs for some goods that need promotion, apply a 
modestly higher tax rate to suit the conditions in our country, 
strive to collect all taxes levied on imported goods, and 
improve tax collection to help increase the proportion of 
procurement derived from the gross domestic product (GDP) (in 
1994 it is estimated at 24 percent). The budget deficit in 1994 
should be lower than that of 1993, and lower than 5 percent by 
1995. The main source of capital to offset the budget deficit 
comes from investment and low-interest loans from other 
countries. While we are striving to increase our national 
budget, we must promote business activities, encourage people to 
practice thrift, and invest in and improve the production of 
goods so as to increase income. Efforts must be made to 
rationally settle capital depreciation at state-run 
establishments to ensure their continued operation, especially 
those at the grass-roots level. 
  Efforts must also be made to improve the management of the 
state budget in conformity with the objectives and division of 
authority and responsibility defined for the various levels of 
the administration; grant more budget authority to ministers for 
specialized projects related to the work of their ministries; 
and accelerate the promulgation of the law on the state budget. 
  I would like to stress here again that while implementing 
various financial measures, we must strive to overcome such 
negative practices as lavish spending, using state funds to buy 
gifts, and organizing feasts to celebrate founding or major 
anniversaries. The government will issue regulations on these 
expenditures. The regulations will clearly define prohibition 
on unessential expenditure and ask the people to monitor and 
expose violations. For the immediate future, during the 
forthcoming Vietnamese Lunar New Year, we must stop using state 
funds to buy gifts for officials of various state organizations, 
regardless of their positions. 
  Banking service: The State Bank, with its increasing 
authority for regulating money circulation, must closely observe 
market indicators to control the amount of currency in 
circulation, ensure that inflation will be kept to the single 
digit-level, and stabilize the value of the dong. In 1994, the 
bank must concentrate its resources and apply many measures, 
including the computerization of its services, to ensure speedy 
and convenient services in all situations. It must designate 
appropriate interest rates to attract all enterprises and people 
to deposit their money and use the banking services. We must 
have measures to deal with high interest rates on credit, which 
are causing difficulties for business and obstructing 
development investment. 
  We have to build and develop an inter-banking market for 
both 
Vietnamese and foreign currencies so that we can regulate 
capital resources and encourage the development of a capital 
market. The bank must quickly expand the non-cash transaction 
services by applying more advanced methods. 
  It is necessary to forestall high inflation and great 
fluctuation in exchange rates when foreign currency resources 
are increased rapidly. The exchange rates between the dong and 
the U.S. dollar must be settled step by step to stabilize the 
true exchange rate (in consideration with the fluctuation of the 
dong and other foreign currencies) in order to encourage 
exports, limit the import of unnecessary goods, but not cause 
sudden price fluctuations. The application and repayment of 
foreign loans by enterprises, departments, and localities must 
be closely supervised. Regulations on loan guarantees and loan 
applications from business enterprises should be introduced 
quickly. 
  Foreign currency management should continue to improve to 
create favorable conditions for the dong to be exchanged freely 
with foreign currencies, making it the only transaction medium 
in the country. 
  Commercial banks which play a major role in the capital 
market must develop their loan activities in the direction 
mentioned previously. Public credit groups should be 
established after drawing experiences from experimental groups. 
Relations between the State Bank and the commercial banks and 
public credit groups must be reformed under the philosophy that 
the supervisory role of the State Bank must be maintained. The 
State Bank must not interfere with the credit and transaction 
activities of commercial banks. It must create a healthy 
competitive environment between commercial banks, including 
foreign banks. A banking association should be established. We 
must increase the training of bank officials and improve the 
management and quality of banking services. 
  III. Resolve Various Socioeconomic Issues More 
Satisfactorily: 
  Realizing that linking economic development with cultural 
and 
social development is the tradition of our people, the character 
of our regime, and the trend of our era, the government has 
given priority to preparing plans and funds to guide various 
cultural and social activities. In 1993, although many sectors 
concerned have not attained their desired results, they made 
some improvements through the use of government funds and 
contributions from the public. 
  The country is embarking on a new era of development. This 
means that from now on, the relationship between economic growth 
and cultural and social development will have more favorable 
conditions. This relationship should be dealt with in a more 
balanced and harmonious manner. 
  Economic development, as explained previously, includes the 
settlement of many very important and fundamental social issues 
such as the creation of jobs and increasing the people's income. 
Cultural and social development has other demands which require 
each person to contribute attention, effort, wisdom, money, 
lifestyle, psychology, and opinion. The government is 
responsible for policies, measures, and funds to create 
favorable conditions for this undertaking to enhance 
development, under the direction that the government and people 
should work together with possible contributions from local and 
foreign organizations. 
  The 1994 draft plan outlines realistic measures and 
increases 
funding for educational and cultural activities; scientific 
research; and public health, physical education, sports, and 
family planning services. I would like to emphasize the 
following issues: 
  A. First, we must improve the people's intellectual 
standard, provide additional training to the contingent of 
laborers and cadres, and train the succeeding generations. 
Given our current requirements, this is a very important task 
aimed at preparing for our country's long-term development, 
especially for embarking on the 21st century with more drastic 
development measures. We must not only improve the quality of 
teaching and studying in all educational institutions in 
conformity with the requirements for socioeconomic development, 
but also mobilize all forces in society, from families to mass 
organizations, including mass media agencies, to improve the 
educational level of the entire society and to create more 
potential for advancement among the youths, who will strive for 
their own personal achievement as well as for the national 
interest. 
  The arrangement of employment for newly graduated students 
must be given attention through assistance measures taken by the 
state and by various mass organizations and families. This will 
contribute greatly to encouraging students to study harder. We 
must create conditions for the contingent of intellectuals to 
dedicate their intelligence and talents to the country and to 
earn a good living with their own careers. The government will 
welcome and create conditions for those Vietnamese intellectuals 
living abroad to participate in socioeconomic development in 
their country in various areas of work and under various 
suitable forms. 
  B. Greater attention must be paid to improving the health of 
the people of various strata. Specifically, we must concern 
ourselves with improving the health of the entire people, 
ranging from children to mothers to the aged for the sake of our 
national construction now and for future generation. 
  Along with government guidance and further budget 
assistance, 
we must step up physical education and sports activities, 
preliminary health care, disease prevention and treatment, 
family planning, and so forth. We must strive to launch a 
movement to carry out these tasks in a wide and far-reaching 
manner with the participation of all individuals, families, 
schools, mass organizations, and the rest of society. 
  In 1994, the government will allocate more funds and provide 
better guidance for implementing various measures to provide 
health care for people in the mountain regions and for ethnic 
minority compatriots. We must dispel and then proceed toward 
eradicating all social diseases and resolve the issue of water 
supplies for our compatriots. 
  C. Improving the intellectual standard and protecting public 
health are essential conditions for averting and dispelling 
social vices, especially prostitution, drug addiction, and the 
danger of being infected with HIV virus as this disease is 
spreading and causing indignation and concern among the people. 
As early as 1993, the government issued a directive with 
drastic measures aimed at preventing and dispelling these social 
vices, but implementation is, however, still slow. 
  The administration at various levels must cooperate with 
mass 
and social organizations in reviewing and profoundly analyzing 
the movement to fight social vices in the past, draw on lessons 
of good works and failures, become familiar with the experiences 
of other countries in order to take practical and effective 
measures suitable to our country's situation. The government 
will create better conditions and provide more financial support 
for these tasks. Most importantly, various authorities in the 
local administration at the provincial, city, district, village, 
and ward levels must strive to seriously carry out their 
functions and duties and take responsibility in curbing social 
vices in their areas. 
  IV. Develop Our New Advantages in Diplomatic Activities: 
  On the basis of the successes of the renovation process and 
taking into account our correct foreign policy, our positive and 
dynamic diplomatic activities have helped create a favorable 
international environment for the cause of national construction 
and defense and for improving the position of Vietnam in the 
international arena as an active member of the trend toward 
peace, stability, and cooperation in this region and the world 
over. 
  We have consistently restored and expanded the relations of 
friendship and cooperation with neighboring and other countries 
in Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region. We have agreed 
to settle conflicts through peaceful negotiations. The 
relations of cooperation between our country and many developed 
nations have expanded, while our relations with traditional 
friendly countries and nonaligned nations have been 
strengthened. In 1993 we also restored relations with 
international financial and monetary organizations while 
strengthening cooperation with the ASEAN and the EC. 
  From this forum, on behalf of the government and people of 
Vietnam, allow me to once again express my gratitude for the 
goodwill, effective cooperation, and valuable assistance given 
by the many countries and international organizations to 
Vietnam's renovation and development process. This assistance 
was clearly reflected at the recent Paris donors conference. I 
would like to avail myself of this opportunity to reassert that 
Vietnam always wants to befriend all countries in the 
international community in the struggle for peace, independence, 
and development. 
  As for the government and people of the United States, we 
advocate closing the past and look toward the future, ready to 
establish normal relations on the basis of equality, mutual 
respect, and without any preconditions. Not only will this 
conform to the aspirations and interests of the two peoples, but 
this will also be beneficial to peace, security, and stability 
in the region. 
  From the vivid reality of implementing our foreign policy, 
we 
can confirm that in the international background of many 
complicated changes, although we have to deal with many 
challenges, we have opportunities to create and develop 
multifaceted relations with all nations and international 
organizations. This should be attributed to our effort in the 
struggle to defend our national independence and sovereignty, 
our determination to attain self-reliance, and our efforts to 
carry out national development while maintaining national 
characteristics under the banner of peace, cooperation, and 
development. This will continuously improve our country's 
prestige and position in the international community, thus 
positively serving the cause of national construction and 
defense. Achievements in the renovation and national 
development and the effective expansion of multifaceted 
cooperation with foreign countries have served as a base for 
strengthening our diplomatic activities. 
  Our foreign policy for the days ahead will be carried out 
and 
developed in depth in accordance with this fundamental 
orientation. 
  V. Enhancing the government's management efficiency: 
  In 1993, the government concentrated efforts on directing 
the 
implementation of 10 major tasks and directly dealt with a 
number of urgent problems and worked with many local governments 
to define development orientations and work out problem-solving 
methods. Those efforts have, together with the very great 
endeavors of our entire party, people, and armed forces, led to 
our socioeconomic achievements in the past year. 
  However, much remains to be done to enhance the government's 
management efficiency. The functions of state management in the 
market economy require that our state apparatus, first of all, 
our administrative apparatus, be fully competent and pure to 
perform their functions as stipulated by law. This is a very 
important part of our efforts to build a law-governed Vietnamese 
state which truly belongs to, comes from, and works for the 
people. 
  As the renovation cause proceeds further, it will become 
more 
difficult and complicated and necessitate efforts to combine 
economic reform with administrative restructuring to ensure a 
rational course of action and coordination to implement the 
overall reform program. Measures must be taken to overcome the 
lack of uniformity, coordination, and even agreement when it 
comes to directing the implementation of the reform program as 
we have experienced in the past. The government's management 
efficiency is guaranteed and enhanced only when its management 
function is carried out in a concentrated and uniform manner and 
only efforts are exerted to overcome all indications of 
departmentalism and regionalism as well as to get rid of 
corruption and purify our state apparatus. In 1994, marked 
progress must be made to overcome the government's management 
drawbacks to create conditions for our renovation process and 
socioeconomic development program to advance a step further. 
  As an immediate objective, concentrated and urgent efforts 
must be made to resolve a number of high-priority problems as 
follows: 
  -- At present, there is an urgent need to create the legal 
framework for all economic activities under the market 
mechanism. First of all, we must accelerate the legislative work 
program by combining efforts to build or amend a number of laws 
still in effect with endeavors to formulate basic legal 
documents, especially the civil code and business law. This 
requires the formation of a contingent of experts to study and 
complete the legislative work program as scheduled. May I 
suggest that the National Assembly spend more time on its 
legislative work to meet the requirements of the economic reform 
program. The government will formulate regulations to ensure 
that law enforcement documents are promulgated in time. It will 
also work to enhance the efficiency of law enforcement agencies, 
regarding this move as an important part of the administrative 
reform program. Law enforcement instruments go hand in hand 
with financial, monetary, and planning apparatus. They must all 
be applied in a uniform manner to manage macro-economic 
activities under the market mechanism. 
  -- It is necessary to define the power of administrative 
organs at all levels, first of all their power to formulate 
rules and regulations, bearing in mind the need to work toward 
the formulation of uniform policies to ensure strict 
implementation of government decisions. Efforts must be made to 
overcome departmentalism, arbitrariness, no discipline, and the 
situation in which ministries, sectors, or local people's 
committees issue legal documents at variance with government 
decisions. 
  In 1994, we should work out plans to abolish administrative 
organs' control over business establishments. Then, on that 
basis, let's reduce the sizes of ministries, agencies under the 
management of the government, and local administrative organs at 
all levels. This is a very important move because it will not 
only make our mechanisms less bulky and bureaucratic, but also 
will help overcome regionalism which prevails in the management 
systems of different sectors and localities. 
  Presently, the administration procedure is too superfluous 
and complicated. It is encouraging the practice of 
authoritarianism, extortion, and corruption by many cadres and 
officials when the people need to register something or apply 
for certain permission. It also creates obstacles and 
difficulties in work relations between different government 
offices. This situation causes difficulties and expenses for 
the public and arouses indignation in society. In 1994, the 
government will carry out reform of administrative procedures 
under the principle of both providing convenience to the public 
and safeguarding the state management of the government. The 
reform will, first, concentrate on areas that are experiencing 
negative phenomena, causing inconveniences to many people and 
obstructing business activities. This task must be carried out 
under deliberated plans with close supervision and control of 
the agencies concerned. Efforts must be made to motivate mass 
organizations and the people to participate in this task, 
especially the contribution of ideas to amend and apply various 
administrative procedures. We must strive to urgently 
promulgate administrative law to serve as a legal base for 
building administrative apparatus and formulating civil servant 
regulation as well as for setting up an administrative tribunal 
to settle the people's complaints against administrative 
agencies and officials. 
  One of the most important tasks is to train and enhance the 
capability of our civil servants, step by step standardize 
administrative positions, and revise procedures on recruiting 
and assigning civil servants. We must formulate appropriate 
plans to carry out this task to produce a contingent of capable 
civil servants who can handle their duties effectively, 
especially those who hold key positions at administrative 
agencies at the central level or in provinces and municipalities. 
  Dear National Assembly deputies: 
  Our nation and people have a tradition of steadfastness. We 
have, on many occasions, proved our capabilities in overcoming 
acute ordeals to survive and develop further, thus creating 
various historical turning points. 
  Presently, while we have great opportunities to develop our 
country we also face numerous difficulties and ordeals. The 
government, however, places its confidence in our nation and the 
people who always uphold the spirit of patriotism and 
self-reliance, develop their intelligence and creativity, and 
maintain their diligence for labor productivity. 
  Together with the National Assembly and the Vietnam 
Fatherland Front, the government will do its best to strengthen 
the great national unity bloc comprising all nationalities, 
religions, and people's strata at home and abroad. We will 
create a favorable environment and conditions for all people to 
do their best to amass wealth for themselves and for the nation. 
We will create necessary conditions for our people to enter the 
21st century with firm capabilities to help extricate our 
country from its situation as a poor and underdeveloped nation. 
  With the wholeheartedness and strong determination of the 
entire people to advance along the path chosen by our party, we 
will definitely miss no opportunity in striving to fulfill all 
tasks set by the National Assembly for 1994, thereby ushering in 
a new stage for socioeconomic development in our country. 
  Thank you very much for your attention.

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The situation at the 
Thai-Cambodian border here remained under control despite the 
heavy fighting inside Cambodia on Sunday which drove some 2,000 
refugees into Thailand, Supreme Commander Woranat Aphichari 
said. Border patrol police and army rangers were keeping vigil 
at the border to ensure there were no spillover, Woranat said. 
"There's nothing to worry about," he said "I don't think we 
have to close the border." [passage omitted] 
  Fighting died down yesterday but the situation remains tense 
after three days of battles between Cambodian government troops 
and Khmer Rouge forces, Thai army officials said. The two 
sides, weakened by heavy casualties, continued to bring up 
reinforcements in the area across the border from Thailand, the 
officials said. Casualty figures were incomplete, but they said 
at lesst 20 were known to have died. The officials estimated 
that Phnom Penh had mobilized some 700 troops backed by four 
armoured vehicles. More men were being brought in to bolster 
forces based at Phum Changnoi, the officials said. They had no 
estimate of Khmer Rouge strength. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Thai government spokesman Aphisit Wetchachiwa 
said 
the present situation would not affect Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai's planned visit to Cambodia between Jan 12 and l4. 
Chuan's agenda would be to seek the Cambodian government's 
guarantee on the future of Thai businesses in Cambodia which has 
been affected by Phnom Penh's measures, Aphisit said. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Thai Investors Need To Learn Cambodian Lessons"] </F>
  [Text] To many Cambodians, the Floating Hotel symbolized 
much of the worst kind of Thai investment in their country. 
  Moored in front of the Royal Palace and less than 50 metres 
from the National Assembly, its presence was perceived as 
cultural insensitivity and arrogance. Its ability to lift 
anchor and steam out of town if things got a little hot also 
implied a grab and run mentality that many Cambodians say is 
typical of Thai investment in their country. 
  The hotel, on government orders, has since taken up a new, 
less offensive birth further up the Tonle Sap river but much 
resentment still remains in Cambodia over Thai businessmen and 
their activities. A dispute over fees charged for stalls at the 
central Olympic market, redeveloped by a Thai company, continues 
to simmer and in recent weeks Khmer language papers have renewed 
their attacks on Thai investment. 
  Like Thailand's military leaders, Thai businessmen, who 
could 
have served to lay foundations for better relations between the 
two countries have instead only caused greater distrust. And in 
many cases it has been nothing more than naked greed for which 
in many cases they are starting to pay. 
  During the more than two decades that Cambodia was engulfed 
in war and revolution, Thailand prospered and emerged as a 
regional economic power. Cambodia's reopening to the world came 
as Thai businessmen were beginning to assume a relatively new 
role as foreign investors. With the signing of the Paris Peace 
accords in 1989, Cambodia was hailed as a golden opportunity and 
Thai speculators and businessmen rushed in. 
  Poor, undeveloped, closed off to the world for decades and 
soon to host the cash-rich UN peace mission -- the thinking was 
get in now or miss the chance forever. Two years later, 
however, Cambodia has become more like a business nightmare. 
  The new government is indicating it will redraft concessions 
awarded to some of the biggest Thai investors in aviation, 
tourism and telecommunications and a sober reevaluation of the 
country suggests the rewards from doing business there are going 
to be small and slow in coming. 
  In the meantime, Thailand's international reputation has 
been 
dragged through the mud. Thai loggers and gem concessionaires 
became the focus of an international campaign to have their 
operations halted because of the environmental havoc they were 
wreaking. The perception that they were the main financial 
supporters of the Khmer Rouge also did little to help Thailand's 
assertions that it deserved credit as one of the main forces 
behind the peace process. In Phnom Penh, Thai businessmen, in 
particular bar and massage owners were singled out as the worst 
of the carpet baggers who descended on Cambodia in search of 
quick profits from the UN mission. 
  In a pure business sense, the most essential mistake made by 
Thai businessmen was to back the wrong horse. Practising 
business much as they have at home, Thai businessmen invested 
heavily in building up contacts with the despised former Phnom 
Penh based government of Hun Sen. 
  The shock election win by the royalist Funcinpec [National 
United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and 
Cooperative Cambodia] party left many Thai businessmen holding 
dubious and potentially worthless contracts. 
  Thai businessmen in Phnom Penh estimate the cost in pay-offs 
for some of the more spectacular concessions won by their 
compatriots could have been as high as 10 million dollars. If 
such reckoning is correct it is a sad irony because, with the 
exception of the oil exploration companies and a few others, 
there has been little legitimate investment in Cambodia of the 
same magnitude. 
  Thais were obviously not the only foreigners doing business 
in Cambodia, nor were they the only ones involved in the logging 
or bar trades, or the only ones with conspicuously close ties to 
the former government. The behaviour of Singaporean and 
Malaysian businessmen has been little different to their Thai 
counterparts although for the most part they seemed to have 
escaped international condemnation. 
  Part of the problem for Thailand has been the traditional 
suspicion with Cambodians have viewed their larger neighbours. 
The return of peace provided the two countries with an 
opportunity to embark on a new chapter in Thai-Cambodian 
relations but so far there is little to suggest a change from 
the distrust of past. 
  The Thai government itself can do little to control Thai 
companies overseas. That is the responsibility of the host 
countries. It can, however, be more aware of internationally 
accepted standards of business behaviour and not defend the 
worst excesses of its businessmen, as was the case with the 
logging and gems concessions. 
  It is also too much to expect Thai businessmen to heed 
official recommendations. In the world of business the only 
lessons are the ones taught by the profit line. Hopefully, 
after the debacle in Cambodia they may yet learn that good 
ethics may also be good business.

  [Text] Eleven Thai fishing trawlers with 134 crewmen were 
seized in early December by Vietnamese authorities on charges of 
violating territorial waters and later detained in Minh Hai 
Province. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwant assigned his 
secretary, Rayong MP Chakkraphan Yomchinda, in coordination with 
Sananchat Thephatsadin, Thai general consul in Ho Chi Minh City, 
to hold talks with the Vietnamese authorities for the release of 
the vessels and crewmen and reduction of the fines set by the 
Vietnamese Government at $30,000 for each vessel and $800 for 
each crewman. After the negotiations, the Vietnamese Government 
agreed to reduce the fines to $25,000 for each vessel and $700 
for each crewman. The total in fines paid was some 9 million 
baht, with 6.5 million from the Foreign Ministry budget and ship 
owners agreeing to pay the remainder to the Thai Government on 
an installment basis. 
  The 11 trawlers, eight from Rayong and three from Samut 
Songkhram Province, left Vietnam on 29 December and arrived in 
Thailand this morning.

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive interview" with Lieutenant General </F>
Chettha Thanacharo, First Army Region commander, by Ubon 
Chanprichasamut; place and date not given -- first paragraph is 
THAILAND TIMES introduction] 
  [Text] The First Army Region, one of four Army Regions, is 
the most powerful force, with headquarters in Bangkok and the 
most important role in national defence. Clearly, every coup 
attempt would have been successful in their operations if the 
leaders controlled the First Army Region. 
  For example, the successful case of the last coup staged by 
groups from the now-defunct National Peace-keeping Council 
(NPKC), led by former Armed Forces commander Gen Suchinda 
Khraprayun was a result of his being able to control the First 
Army Region. 
  The First Army Region Commander, Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo, 
presenting an exclusive interview to THAILAND TIMES, said the 
overall view of its yearly operation was satisfactory. 
  The most important thing, he said, was that they had fully 
met the policy of the Army Commander-in-Chief, Gen Wimon 
Wongwanit, both in man power and public assistance. 
  This year, the Army Commander-in-Chief voiced concern mostly 
about the drought crisis, said Chettha, adding that the drought 
crisis will reach the critical stage next summer. 
  "It was an urgent matter for the First Army Region to 
coordinate with the other three Army regions to map out 
assistant measures for those affected by the drought. The 
manforce and a variety of equipment are prepared to help the 
people." 
  The First Army remains on alert for the coming drought 
situation, coordinating with three main agencies concerned, 
namely the Provincial Electricity Authority, the Department of 
Mineral Resource and the Army to mobilise equipment and funds 
for those adversely affected areas. 
  "One agency alone can not tackle this serious problem, and 
the joint cooperation was a need to mostly benefit the people." 
  Currently, the country is peaceful, without serious 
problems, 
only problems along the border which affect the nation, such as 
Khmer bandits and stolen car gangs smuggling cars to Cambodia. 
  "The cars must run on the roads, and they will not be 
allowed 
to cross to Cambodia. War weapons and ammunition, such as were 
described to me, are the most serious problem, and serious 
preventive measures must be implemented as much as possible to 
prevent bringing them into the capital city and other cities. 
The violence and crime can not be eliminated if the problem of 
these fatal arms is not tackled first." 
  The Army has tried to do its best to suppress the arms, Lt 
Gen Chettha said, adding that the Suranari Task Force has been 
successful in arresting countless numbers of them. 
  The soldiers and the policemen also have tried to do their 
best to intercept those arms, he said. Lt [as published] 
Chettha also admitted that it was impossible to be 100 percent 
successful, and that 95 or 98 percent was satisfactory. 
  As to the problem of drug smuggling along the border zone, 
Lt 
Gen Chettha said the problem still existed but has been greatly 
reduced. The area where culprits seek to smuggle drugs is along 
border points where the fighting still remains active, as the 
smugglers know the situation well, and know the correct time to 
smuggle drugs. However, smuggling is very rare at border points 
right now as soldiers have been alerted to the situation and can 
prevent the smuggling. 
  Regarding the war weapons and ammunition found in 
Chanthaburi Province, Gen Wimon said the matter had been 
concluded without any problems. Every side understood one 
another, whether problems with soldiers or with police, or 
soldiers with the Khmer. He said the soldiers clearly explained 
the situation. There was no conflict or uncertainty on this 
matter. We have to help each other for the benefit of the 
nation as a whole, Wimon said. 
  As for the incidents along the border zone, the Army has 
continuously trained border villagers to defend themselves from 
the enemy when facing a problem. The training courses go back 
to the period when Vietnam invaded Cambodia. The border needed 
to be trained to defend themselves or they would be affected by 
the fighting. 
  Lt Gen Chettha said the Army has continuously and 
successfully trained the people living along the border zone 
regions to love the nation, and to defend themselves and their 
villages. It was not difficult for them to help society when 
they were well trained by government authorities, he said. 
  Apart from this, he also expressed his ideas over the 
conflicts between permanent officials and politicians, saying 
that he did not consider it as a problem. It was normal to have 
conflict in a democracy where everyone has the right to express 
their ideas. 
  Even opinions of three people on the same thing are not 
always the same, but rather definitely different. The thoughts 
and actions must not be against democracy, he said. 
  "Every side must find the best resolution on matters of 
conflict, by discussion the issues with reason, but not 
emotions, for the benefit of the real happiness and prosperity 
of our nation." 
  "I view everything as normal in a democracy. Nobody can 
force the idea to be the same thing or the same idea. We need 
excellent and clever ideas but they must be in the scope of 
democracy and responsibility," said Lt Gen Chettha. 
  The First Army Commander said the people must be patient, 
even though they are bored with conflicting ideas expressed by 
the permanent officials and politicians. It was against 
democracy if people are blocked in their ideas. So every side 
has to be based on reason, listening to the truth. He said 
clear policies have been drafted for each agency, and that they 
should abide by the rules in order to implement the policy. 
  Every society and group has done things for the benefit of 
the common people. It is normal to have a variety of ideas, he 
said. In a democratic society, a variety of ideas are considered 
a core factor in fostering democracy. 
  Everyone must be a dedicated democrat and his actions has to 
be within the scope of democracy, said Chettha. 
  Chettha said he himself was optimistic about the image of 
the 
soldiers, although many people were pessimistic, saying, that he 
was ready to listen to the voice of the majority. 
  The people would judge it on an individual basis, not 
relating the mistake to the institute. Whoever was found 
violating the rule of the soldier must be punished without 
exception. 
  "I was surprised by the criticism hurled at the image of 
soldiers claiming a soldier was nobody else but the one carrying 
out his duties to defend the nation. It is impossible for every 
soldier in the Army to be good since each comes from a different 
family." 
  Everything must be based on fairness, and violators must be 
face the punishment, said Chettha, adding, everyone must follow 
their commanders. 
  "Every soldier must act like a hero with a compromising 
mind, 
and keep calm when people when with many problems turn to them 
for help," Chettha added. 
  National politics, with the soldiers in 1994, is very strong 
and stable. It is considered the best of all ages of the Army 
institute. He added that the military will not be involved in 
national politics. The Army was to follow all governmental 
policies. 
  Even if political uncertainties exist, it must not affect 
the 
Army. In principle, government must work for prosperity, peace, 
and the well-being of the people. If it strictly follows the 
regulations, problems would not occur.

  [Excerpts] Disney Consumer Products International Inc a 
subsidiary of the world's cartoon king The Walt Disney Co, will 
take more serious action against pirated products as warnings do 
not work in Thailand, said Malathip Khunwattana, country manager 
for Thailand. 
  After two years in Thailand, the company, which handles the 
merchandise licensing and marketing of Disney consumer products, 
found piracy one of the worst barriers to the growth of the 
company and its licensees. 
  "We have worked closely with our lawyers and detectives to 
trace the sources and manufacturers of these pirated products. 
Our licensees also inform us immediately when they see fake 
Walt Disney consumer goods," she said. 
  "Sometimes, we sent letters of warnings, telling them to 
stop 
such unfair practices. But this system does not work 
efficiently here. Sometimes we asked police to arrest them and 
seize the fake goods. But most serious sentence is to fine them 
thousands of baht for malpractice. And we usually see them 
selling the copied products again on the next day, perhaps at a 
different place." 
  To ensure its licensees of protection, the company plans to 
take more serious action against pirates. As the country's 
copyright law has been improved, the company will begin by 
asking the police to arrest the manufacturers and sellers of the 
counterfeit products while the issuance of wamings will be 
reduced. 
  "Licensees would be very happy to be strongly protected 
because they have paid a huge sum for the licence to produce 
copyrighted products," she said. 
  She noted that some people who used to produce unlicensed 
Disney products approached the company, asking to be a licensee. 
The company very much welcomes them because it means that their 
product quality will be improved and there will be less piracy. 
  Strong protection is the most important duty for Disney 
Consumer Products. When the company was formed in late 1991, it 
handled only about 10 licensees. Malathip calls them the 
"grandpa generation" because they are the pioneers in Thailand. 
Now, the company has approximately 60 licensees in the country. 
  The company saw dramatic growth in revenue during the 
1991/92 
fiscal year of around 200 per cent and has continued to enjoy 
remarkable revenue growth in 1992/93 at 160 per cent. 
  With rapid growth, the company is looking forward to 
expanding its marketing department. When the company was 
established two years ago, there was only Malathip and her 
secretary. Now the office has a staff of about ten. To cope 
with the growing business, the company will have to recruit more 
employees. It expects to have more than 20 in 1994. 
  Everybody in the company has to work hard because the second 
most important duty is to provide full support to the licensees. 
The company works continuously to come up with new promotional 
campaigns to help its licensees. 
  "We enjoy ourselves very much creating new promotional 
campaigns. Campaigns allow our licensees to work together to 
promote their products." [passage omitted] 
  "We are here to make our licensees' lives easier. They can 
go ahead with their development plans without worrying because 
we will provide them full support and protection." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [By Somchit Siturongkkhathum] </F>
  [Text] The Foreign Ministry is drastically short of 
diplomats qualified to negotiate multilateral trade agreements. 
The brain-drain to the private sector has gutted the pool of 
experienced talent. There are at most 10 diplomats able to 
negotiate at international levels, the ministry's Deputy 
Permanent Secretary Pratyathan Dawi Tawethikun, told THE NATION. 
"We now lack officials who are eligible to represent Thailand 
at global-level negotiations." 
  "The permanent secretary is very concerned about the 
matter," 
he said. 
  During the fiscal year Oct 1992 to Sept 1993, four C-10 
diplomats left the Foreign Ministry, including the former 
ambassador to Brussels Danai Dulalumpha, one of the few Thais 
well acquainted with the European Community market. Three C-10 
diplomats resigned the preceding three years. Senior officials 
are urgently seeking a way to reverse the drain of talent, and 
to train promising middle-ranking and junior staff. 
  Officials trace the start of the brain-drain back to 1990, 
when the private sector's high pay strategy first began to 
influence Thai society. The number of qualified applicants for 
the annual intake of staff has also dropped. Not all ministry 
officials, however, regard the situation as critical and say it 
is only to be expected that the most experienced people, having 
already fulfilled their ambitions within the ministry, should 
look elsewhere for a fresh challenge. 
  "They have fulfilled their career goals. Now that they have 
honour money and connections they can go into businesses or even 
take a rest," a mid-level official said. 
  Another senior official also said the resignation rate 
amongst senior officials, although high, was not of too much 
concern. 
  "The situation is not worrying when compared to resignation 
levels at other ministries," he said. He admitted, though, that 
the number of resignations had also increased at the lower and 
middle levels. 
  During the past three years, about 20 C-4 to C-8 grade 
employees had resigned from the ministry, which now had a staff 
of less than 1,200 and war, the smallest in the government. 
However, he was not too worried and insisted the Foreign 
Ministry was still an attractive career option. 
  "A career here is promising for people who want to be 
diplomats, to travel and live overseas," he said. 
  There were about 70 C-10 positions in the ministry, and 
ample 
opportunities for people with ambition. 
  Another ministry source said there had also been a dramatic 
decrease in the number of applicants for junior openings, at the 
C-3 and C-4 levels, during the annual recruitment. 
  A decade ago when there were more than 4,000 applications 
for 
the approximately 40 openings each year, this year there had 
only been 1,200. However, Pratyathan Dawi said the drop in 
applications was not a problem as most of the new recruits were 
highly qualified. 
  "It's not only the Foreign Ministry which attracts fewer 
applicants. But we can take comfort that those entering the 
ministry are capable," he said. However, in order to keep 
experienced staff and attract quality recruits the ministry had 
to compete increasingly with the private sector. 
  The ministry recently gave government scholarships to 60 
people to continue their studies, some to PhD levels. 
  "This way we can ensure that these people will come back and 
join the ministry," he said. 
  A C-6 official told THE NATION he was proud to work at the 
Foreign Ministry and had no plans to quit. 
  "I am satisfied with what I am doing here, despite the low 
income," he said. "Most of us here don't have any financial 
problems. But if I was offered a salary of, say, Bt [baht] 
50,000 by a private company, I might go," he said. 
  A C-4 staffer said she would not leave the ministry since 
she 
was accustomed to being part of the bureaucratic system, in 
addition to the pride she had in her career. She said not all 
of her colleagues shared her thinking. Several junior officials 
had left the ministry during her three years there. 
  "The most popular reasons for resigning are the low wages 
and 
the boredom of working in a bureaucracy," she said.

<F P=106> [News conference by unidentified "senior U.S. Government </F>
official" at U.S. Embassy in Tokyo following 12-13 October 
U.S.-Japan discussions on insurance with unidentified reporters] 
  [Text] [Reporter] When will the next meeting be held? 
  [U.S. official] We did not decide at this meeting, but it 
will probably be in mid-November. 
  [Reporter] You stated that quantitative indices will be used 
to observe the change in the Japan market. What level do you 
think the foreign share in Japan should be? 
  [U.S. official] The table I just showed you represents the 
breadth of foreign shares in the G-7 nations, and it indicates 
how apart Japan is from this breadth. We hope that the gaps will 
be bridged. 
  If the points of concern regarding the Japan market, which I 
explained today, are adequately solved within the framework of 
insurance reform, the logical result is that Japan's insurance 
market will approach those of the other G-7 nations. 
Specifically, in terms of openness and the competitive aspect, 
and with the foreign companies able to display their ability to 
offer technical innovations in Japan, Japan will approach the 
other advanced nations and, when that is achieved, the figures 
themselves will naturally change. 
  [Reporter] You stated that the United States has no 
intention 
of indicating specific figures, and that you do not intend to 
retaliate although the figures may not be achieved. If the gap 
is not bridged and the Japan market does not change despite the 
use of other indices, what will happen after that? 
  [U.S. official] A memo was handed by Ambassador Kantor to 
Ambassador Kuriyama concerning the comprehensive framework 
agreement, and in it is written that the United States will 
reserve the right to use the trade act. The U.S. trade act 
includes Article 301 and also Article 1377 concerning the 
telecommunications agreement. The trade act also includes a law 
called "Title VII" which encompasses government procurement in 
the foreign countries. Consequently, if the framework talks do 
not progress smoothly, it is clear that the United States will 
reserve the right to use the trade act. 
  However, I believe that the situation will not evolve to 
that 
point. The reason is that the Insurance Council has issued the 
report from various angles, and the content of the U.S. proposal 
closely corresponds with the content of the report. Also, the 
Hosokawa cabinet is treating the easing of controls as a 
priority task and, if so, the insurance issue should also be 
included. Therefore, we do not believe at all that the situation 
I just described will come to pass, and I believe that we can 
achieve great success. 
  [Reporter] Are you optimistic about expanding the 2-percent 
share to a double-digit level? And if you consider a 
double-digit level to be desirable, what is your target 
timeframe in terms of years? 
  [U.S. official] We would prefer a triple digit over a double 
digit (laughter), but that is unrealistic. We believe that the 
present gap should be bridged in broad form from a medium-term 
viewpoint. By medium-term is usually meant three or four years 
as pointed out by the OECD. However, despite new rules and 
regulations, we do not believe that a nation's market can change 
overnight. 
  First, the attitude and behavior within Japan's market must 
of course change, and also financial investments and agreements 
by the foreign insurers will be necessary. So, in terms of 
generally bridging the gaps between Japan and the other G-7 
nations, we believe that we can easily adopt a medium-term 
viewpoint--that is, expect the gaps to be bridged within three 
to four years. 
  [Reporter] Are you considering the indication of indices in 
areas other than the talks on the insurance problem? 
  [U.S. official] Our purpose is to work together with the 
Japanese Government and to agree on a combination of 
qualititative and quantitative indices. In measuring the 
results, our goal is to achieve them without a trace of 
ambiguity. This aspect will be part of the talks to take place 
within the next several weeks or months. 
  Our desire is to agree on these indices between the United 
States and Japan. However, if it is unsuccessful, we will 
unilaterally formulate qualitative and quantitative indices. The 
reason is that it is necessary to measure whether we have 
succeeded or whether there have been results, and we would like 
of course to proceed jointly with the Japanese Government in an 
agreed form. However, if that is not feasible, we will be 
compelled to proceed independently. 
  [Reporter] Is there a basis on which you indicated the 
shares 
of the foreign companies? Also, the Japan side is protesting the 
basis for the calculation of the figures. What was the response 
by Japan? 
  [U.S. official] By foreign insurers, we mean cases where 
more 
than 50 percent of foreign capital is invested. Some informed 
sources say that it is preferable to use OECD figures. However, 
in reporting statistics to the OECD, various nations submit them 
on the basis of their respective and different definitions. 
Therefore, we believe that the OECD statistics lack credibility. 
  We indicated the figures to the Japanese Government today, 
but the Japanese side has not had the opportunity to read them 
carefully. We believe that the Japanese Government will probably 
review the background sources of the figures and the data. We 
also believe that it will eventually understand what the figures 
represent. Perhaps a debate on these criteria will take place at 
our next meeting. However, we feel extremely comfortable with 
the figures. For example, the share in France is indicated as 10 
percent, but it is not a major problem whether it is 11 percent 
or 9 percent. The problem, after all, is that the gaps between 
Japan and the other advanced nations are excessively large, and 
that these gaps must absolutely be reduced. 
  [Reporter] Do these figures cover both life insurance and 
nonlife insurance? 
  [U.S. official] They cover both life and nonlife insurance. 
However, the 2 percent for Japan is perhaps too high. The reason 
is that the figure for postal insurance is not included. If it 
is included, the denominator will be larger and the result will 
be less than 2 percent. We are presently requesting data on the 
figure that includes postal insurance.

  [Text] In connection with the Japanese-U.S. construction 
talks, the Ministry of Home Affairs is troubled about deciding 
as to what extent it should open the market concerning public 
works projects undertaken by local governments. In view of the 
20 January deadline set by the United States on imposing 
sanctions on Japan, the ministry would have a better chance of 
avoiding the sanctions should it be able to take bold steps 
toward opening the market. What is more important, however, is 
that the decision on opening the U.S. market regarding public 
works projects undertaken by local governments has been withheld 
since the U.S. Government has been unable to obtain the approval 
of state governments concerning the agreement on government 
procurement concluded at GATT's new round of multilateral trade 
talks (Uruguay Round) on 15 December. Therefore, local 
governments in Japan have raised complaints by asking, "Why 
should only Japan have to open its market regarding public works 
projects undertaken by local governments?" 
  To avoid U.S. sanctions, the Japanese Government plans to 
draw up as soon as early January an action program which is to 
include such measures as improvements to the bidding system. 
Among points of primary concern to local governments are: 1) 
the minimum value of construction projects which will be subject 
to a competitive bidding system open to bidders who meet certain 
requirements; and 2) whether the market opening would be 
expanded to include projects undertaken by the governments of 
not only prefectures but also cabinet-order-designated cities. 
  In the recent GATT trade talks, Japan agreed that public 
works projects undertaken by governments of both prefectures and 
cabinet-order-designated cities valued at over 15 million SDR 
(the IMF's special drawing right) units, or about 2.3 billion 
yen at the current exchange rate, would be subject to bidding 
procedures according to the GATT accords. Under MITI's new 
action program, it is possible that the minimum value of such 
public works projects may be further lowered from the current 15 
million SDR units. However, it has become very clear in the 
negotiations on government procurement that "concerning public 
works projects undertaken by local governments, the U.S. market 
is also closed." 
  Consequently, the Home Affairs Ministry apparently feels 
deep 
down that "in terms of the principles of reciprocity, Japan 
cannot make new concessions unless the United States shows its 
market opening plans first." However, the ministry certainly 
cannot take such a hard-line attitude in bilateral trade talks 
considering Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States. 
On the other hand, the ministry would undoubtedly have a hard 
time coordinating matters at home if it were to make concessions 
that would satisfy the United States. Thus, it is racking its 
brain as the deadline approaches for the United States' planning 
to impose sanctions on Japan.

<F P=106> ["Core" column by editorial staff member Tadahiko Nasa and </F>
political department reporter Uichiro Oshima: "`Butrus-Ghali's 
Diplomacy Toward Japan' Has Changed"; first paragraph is 
newspaper introduction] 
  [Text] After finishing a five-day visit to Japan, UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali headed toward Korea on 22 
December. It was his second visit to Japan following his visit 
last February. Compared to his first visit, which gave an 
impression that "the UN secretary general is a hard-liner," his 
remarks during his recent visit on such issues as Japan's 
Self-Defense Forces' [SDF] participation in UN peacekeeping 
operations (PKO) were extremely moderate. In his talks with 
Japanese leaders, he expressed his strong hope that in the near 
future Japan will play a nonmilitary role as a permanent member 
of the UN Security Council [UNSC]. The following is a report on 
the purpose of the visit by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, 
whose position on Japan has softened. 
<H5>  Stand of "Paying Attention to Japan" </H5>
  Although it is unusual for the UN secretary general to visit 
Japan twice in one year, there was a reason. 
  In Egypt, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's homeland, 
there 
is a prominent poet named "Hafez Ibrahim" [as published], who 
wrote a poem called "The Mikado" [Emperor] which praises Japan's 
victory in its war with Russia as a model for the Third World. 
  This poem is very famous in Egypt and is even in a textbook. 
UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, who is 71 years old now, 
said he also learned from this poem in his younger days and then 
deepened his understanding of Japan. The fact that his 
itinerary for both the first and second visits specially 
included a visit to the Togo Shrine in Harajuku, Tokyo, reflects 
his interest in Japan. 
  In a 22 December news conference at the National Press Club, 
the secretary general said "Japan's winning a permanent seat on 
the UNSC will lead to strengthening the United Nations," showing 
his stand of attaching importance to Japan. It can be said that 
underlying such remarks is his understanding of Japan, which he 
fostered in his younger days. 
  Meanwhile, however, we felt that the secretary general, who 
is regarded as "an experienced politician" (from a Foreign 
Ministry source), made such remarks in consideration of the 
Hosokawa government, which is regarded as being "fragile." In 
preparation for his visit to Japan, the secretary general 
reportedly gathered detailed information from Yoshio Hatano, the 
ambassador accredited to the United Nations, on the ruling 
coalition's internal situation, Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
political position, and other problems facing Japan. 
  In separate talks with Prime Minister Hosokawa, Foreign 
Minister Hata, and leaders of the ruling and opposition parties, 
UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali stressed that "there seems to 
be a misunderstanding in Japan that the dispatch of military 
members to the UN PKO is the precondition for Japan's winning a 
UNSC permanent membership." He also said: "Of UN activities, 
the PKO accounts for about 30 percent and the remaining 70 
percent is for environmental protection, economic development, 
and the other activities." In this way, in an attempt to help 
promote the people's interest in gaining a UNSC permanent 
membership, he emphasized Japan's greater contributions to 
nonmilitary affairs. 
<H5>  "Bitter Experience" in February </H5>
  Behind the UN secretary general's strong desire for a 
Japanese visit in December is his bitter experience during his 
last visit in February. Before he visited in February, he had 
said in an interview in New York that "Japan should take part in 
the UN peace enforcement troops, even by revising its 
Constitution." This remark shocked Japanese Government 
officials including (then) Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. 
  Shocked at his remark, Yohei Kono, the then chief cabinet 
secretary (currently the president of the Liberal Democratic 
Party], in his meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, 
affirmed that, "Japan has no intention of becoming a UNSC 
permanent member." (Then) Prime Minister Miyazawa also showed 
cautious views on Butrus-Ghali's remarks on the plea of "Japan's 
Constitution" and "the people's feelings." 
<H5>  Issues Facing the United Nations </H5>
  There are other reasons for UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali's taking a favorable position on Japan. One is 
that he, in his two-year service so far, has come to realize how 
Japan holds an important position in the United Nations. 
  Although Japan's current assessed contribution to the United 
Nations is 12.45 percent, it seems it may be raised to about 13 
percent starting in 1995. In addition, Japan, in line with 
Prime Minister Hosokawa's attendance at the September UN General 
Assembly session, generously contributed approximately $100 
million to PKO activities. For the United Nations, which is 
facing financial difficulties, Japan is an important sponsor. 
Therefore, it is natural for the secretary general to consider 
it expedient to win Japan over to his side. 
  Another reason is that because of a PKO success in Cambodia, 
the secretary general himself has started considering that a 
traditional PKO method is more realistic than a forcible method 
under the "peace enforcement troops," which he proposed in July 
1992. Under the traditional PKO, there would be room for Japan 
to make human resources contributions. 
  As far as Japan's PKO is concerned, what is drawing UN 
attention is how Japan will deal with the issue concerning 
former Yugoslavia. The Japanese Government has announced its 
plan to send fact-finding missions there early next January. 
After the completion of the fact-finding survey, attention will 
then be focused on whether Japan will make personnel 
contributions in addition to its financial cooperation. 
  On the issue of personnel contributions, Mr. Yasushi Akashi, 
chief of the UN peacekeeping forces [PKF] in former Yugoslavia, 
has recently expressed the hope that Japan will take part in 
rear-echelon support troops. Although the connection between 
his remarks and Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's position is not 
clear, the government is negative about sending SDF troops to 
former Yugoslavia at present. 
  The Defense Agency [DA] was nervous about UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali's Japanese visit because it feared that 
"Butrus-Ghali might ask the government to send the SDF to former 
Yugoslavia." 
  Underlying the DA's anxiety is the fact that just before 
Butrus-Ghali's visit, Yasushi Akashi, who is to head the UN PKF 
in the former Yugoslavia, indicated his view that it is possible 
for Japan to join the PKF under the current PKO cooperation law 
if Japan's activity is limited to rear-echelon support. 
  In response, DA Director General Kazuo Aichi met with Prime 
Minister Hosokawa and indicated the DA's cautious view on 
Akashi's proposal; and senior DA officials, including Shigeru 
Hatayama, DA administrative vice minister, also indicated a 
cautious attitude in an effort to check General Secretary 
Butrus-Ghali's move. A voice within the DA has been expressed 
that what made Butrus-Ghali refrain from referring to this issue 
is "the DA's defensive move" (according to a senior DA 
official), thus reflecting DA officials' relief. 
  The reason the DA is cautious about sending the SDF to 
former 
Yugoslavia is that its dispatch would be criticized for running 
counter to the PKO cooperation law that stipulates that "a 
cease-fire agreement should be reached between conflicting 
parties" before the dispatch of Japanese troops. 
  Since a cease-fire accord has often been scrapped in former 
Yugoslavia, the DA points out that the case in former Yugoslavia 
is different from that in Cambodia, wherein the DA says "the 
cease-fire accord was kept although there were sporadic 
conflicts." In this way, the DA stresses that "it is not a 
matter of a type of PKO activities there but of the PKO law." 
  With regard to Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's remarks, 
there is a voice within the DA that "Butrus-Ghali now fully 
understands Japan's difficult position on the PKO." Meanwhile, 
among senior officials, another view has also been expressed: 
"Secretary General Butrus-Ghali must have given priority to 
Japan's contribution in such areas as financial affairs other 
than PKO activities."

<F P=106> [Unattributed "Seismometer" column article] </F>
  [Text] Eight pro-coalition factions of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] have recently united into a 
policy group called "Democrats." It appears the new SDPJ 
faction is getting ready for a breakaway from the party when 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and the ideology-oriented factions 
react negatively toward the enactment of the political reform 
bills. In fact, the Democrats are steadily promoting 
"exchanges" with the Japan New Party [JNP] and the Sakigake. 
The weak point of the Democrats is the fact that they have no 
prominent leader yet, but many members expect Hokkaido Governor 
Takahiro Yokomichi to return to the Diet to lead them. If that 
happens, the Democrats may trigger the second stage of political 
regrouping, with some members actively seeking the foundation of 
"a troika party led by three ex-governors -- Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, and Mr. Yokomichi as 
the leader of the Democrats." 
<H5>  Forty Dietmen Gather at Founding Assembly </H5>
  On 22 December, or the day following the launch of the 
Democrats, SDPJ Diet Administration Committee Chairman Koken 
Nosaka criticized Vice Chairman Churyo Morii in the Diet for 
participating in the Democrats as a commissioner. Nosaka said: 
"I do not think organizing a new, giant faction is a good idea. 
Even in my faction there are members seeking to form new 
groups, but I am stopping them from such reckless action." 
  Morii, however, did not take the complaint seriously, and 
answered: "I agree with you. I just allowed them to use my 
name. That was all I did." 
  Nosaka angrily said: "If you really agreed with me you would 
have tried to stop them." 
  The founding assembly of the Democrats comprised 40 SDPJ 
Diet 
members from both the rightist and middle-of-the-road factions. 
Members include former SDPJ Chairman Makoto Tanabe and former 
Secretary General Hirotaka Akamatsu. While such interfactional 
movements have never had any success so far in the SDPJ, the 
foundation of the Democrats may represent the turning-point for 
the party. In an address given to the founding assembly, 
Secretary General Shogo Abe of the Social Democratic Federation 
said emotionally: "I feel my party has now completed its 
historical role." SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo did not 
address the assembly out of consideration for the position of 
Chairman Tomiichi Murayama; however, the group adopted as its 
main objective the "regrouping of political parties" rather than 
the SDPJ rightists' conventional goal of "party reform." 
  The Democrats use their broadly-acceptable name to actively 
seek ties with other parties. As the secretary general of the 
Democrats, former Secretary General Akamatsu attended the first 
meeting of a study group on "long-term and basic problems" on 22 
December. It was jointly organized by the Democrats and some 
JNP members. Akamatsu stressed that "closer ties between the 
Democrats and the JNP will trigger a greater trend toward 
political regrouping." The study group was organized by 26 
members, with equal numbers from the JNP and the SDPJ. The SDPJ 
members all belong to the Democrats. In its platform, the 
Democrats declared policy is to seek "small central government 
and big local government." This is also an objective of the 
study group. 
  On the evening of the same day, Democrats Commissioner 
Masanori Goto met with Representative Kenichiro Sato and other 
Sakigake members. They discussed positively a "three-party 
tie-up between the JNP, Sakigake, and the SDPJ." 
  Goto proposed: "The JNP, the Sakigake, and the SDPJ should 
carry out a nationwide campaign tour next spring. It will have 
a great impact on the public." 
<H5>  Receiving Yokomichi as Deputy Prime Minister </H5>
  On the evening of 21 December, SDPJ ideologists held a 
meeting as if in competition with the Democrats. At the 
meeting, SDPJ Chairman Murayama predicted: "The coalition 
government may make further concessions to the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] on the political reform bills, and 
further revise them to bring them more into line with the LDP 
proposal. This means the coalition is deserting the SDPJ. In 
mid-January, the SDPJ is likely to be faced with the ultimate 
choice." 
  SDPJ ideologists will not accept drastic concessions on the 
political reform bills, but Murayama is afraid the "Democrats 
may support the coalition even against the wishes of the party 
leadership." When Diet debates on the political reform bills 
reach a climax in mid-January, the SDPJ will face a crucial 
choice. 
  The Democrats group, meanwhile, is not yet fully active 
because it "has a team flag but no captain." The faction is 
currently led by nine commissioners selected from eight 
pro-coalition factions. The lack of one prominent leader is the 
reason the Democrats want Governor Yokomichi, who used to serve 
as an SDPJ lower house member, as their leader alongside 
Hosokawa and Takemura. 
  The Democrats, JNP members, and major union officials are 
excited about the idea of getting Yokomichi back to the Diet. 
Some of them say: "The Democrats, the JNP, Sakigake, LDP 
reformists, and some Democratic Socialist Party members should 
form a 100-man party now, before the next general election, to 
start a new trend in Japanese politics. If that were to happen, 
the party would become popular under its troika leadership of 
Hosokawa, Takemura, and Yokomichi." 
  Yet others say: "If Mr. Yokomichi returns to the lower 
house, we would prepare for him the post of deputy prime 
minister." SDPJ Secretary General Kubo was an ally of Yokomichi 
when they organized the New Trend Association [Atarashii 
Nagare-no-kai]. An SDPJ cabinet member said: "At that time, 
Mr. Kubo's dream was to serve as the party secretary general 
under Chairman Yokomichi. I think he still has the dream." 
<H5>  "Differences" in Attitudes of JNP Members </H5>
  In mid-December, Governor Yokomichi visited Tokyo to make 
petitions about the 1994 budget; however, he had positive 
meetings with senior SDPJ officials and labor unions during his 
stay. On 24 December, he held a news conference at the Hokkaido 
Prefectural Government's Tokyo office, and announced "I am now 
working on Hokkaido's fiscal 1994 budget, and I have to serve my 
third term to the end." 
  However, when he met Shinseito officials Yokomichi 
reportedly 
said he might resign from the prefectural government after 
enacting the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  He was quoted then as saying: "If the general election is 
held in January, I cannot run in that. The governor's position 
is different from that of an assemblyman because I have to 
fulfill my responsibility to the public by enacting the 1994 
budget for Hokkaido." 
  Governor Yokomichi is unlikely to take action if there is an 
election in January. Members of the Democrats are irritated by 
this, saying "contrary to our expectations he seems to be a man 
of indecision." 
  At the JNP secretaries' meeting held on 22 December, Vice 
Secretary General Seishu Makino called reported the foundation 
of the long-term problem study group and called it a joint 
JNP-SDPJ group. 
  Secretary Kodo Kohata reacted strongly to this, saying: 
"What I want is not an explanation, but your apology." There 
are many pro-Shinseito members in the JNP, and they do not 
really welcome closer ties with the SDPJ Democrats. SDPJ 
Democrats may have great expectations of political events next 
year, but they still feel a sense of uncertainty.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Special Article by Michio Watanabe, Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] member of the House of Representatives, entitled: 
"Ozawa-Style Reform Is Pursuing its Objectives Too Hastily."] 
  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], after losing its 
rein on government as the result of the general elections, seems 
to have lost its self-confidence and to be on the verge of 
flight. The coalition government asserts it will carry on the 
LDP's policies, and for all that, the LDP cannot change its way 
of thinking. However, it cannot be construed to be in a posture 
determined to regain the reins of government when the party 
president utters the same thing as what Prime Minister Hosokawa 
says and party members appear in television programs only to 
criticize their party's defects in expectation of popular 
applause. 
  I am fully aware of the uneasy feeling of those who remain 
in 
the LDP amidst the spreading atmosphere that they have lost the 
chance to climb aboard the bandwagon now that Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] has split off and the coalition regime enjoys 
high popularity ratings. However, now is the time for the LDP 
to make clear and have the people understand how it differs from 
the coalition regime and be ready to launch the battle to win 
back power in the near future. The LDP must apologize to the 
people for what it must reflect upon and prepare for the battle. 
  The objective, however, is not to regain popular support and 
win the elections. The objective is to have the people 
understand what will be done with the power regained by the 
victory and how what it will do differs from what the coalition 
cabinet will do. I am telling young politicians frequently: "I 
do not think you have become politicians to put a badge on your 
lapels. Go ahead and do in a dignified manner the things that 
you wanted to do in becoming politicians." 
  It is still fresh in everybody's memory, so I cannot say it 
crisply, but let me say it. In the wake of post-general 
election confusion, many of my colleagues held me back from 
being a candidate in the election for the LDP presidency for 
which people of other factions recommended me. I dared to run 
because I wanted to make clear the difference between the LDP 
from the coalition cabinet as well as my thoughts and ideas to 
recapture power to, first of all, bring business out of 
recession. Miscalculations led me to failure, but I feel a 
responsibility at all times since I received forty percent 
support. 
  After the coalition government came into being, business 
conditions worsened. The people are bewildered by the statement 
of Prime Minister Hosokawa who defined the pre-war Japanese 
activities as the war of aggression, and they are wavering in 
their trust in the state. Such difficult problems are left 
untouched and unsolved as the state of the Self-Defense Forces, 
introduction of the consumption tax, and cutting the income tax, 
pension reforms, and liberalization of rice controls. The 
coalition government is fond of using the term "sense of 
versatile values," which means adjustment of versatile 
interests. And progress is not made in these political 
fundamentals due to the lack of seasoned political personalities 
and the disunited response of the eight groups. Above all, the 
underlying discordance among the coalition about the political 
reform which is the sole adhesive that puts the coalition 
together is widely known. Flowery catch phrases such as 
decentralization of power and deregulation are spoken of, but 
politics is not a forum. 
  I would say that now is about the time for the coalition to 
emerge from the period of the "wakaba mark" [the symbol mark of 
a novice driver, hence meaning political freshman]. In the face 
of a violently changing time of internationalization, the people 
are disturbed if the government deals with such a situation 
leisurely. It is vital to possess a fresh sense, but the 
management of state affairs requires appropriate experience. 
Cars driven by inexperienced drivers are precarious, even if 
seasoned instructors of driving schools help control the 
accelerators. 
  Now is the time, I think, that Japanese politics should be 
retaken into the hands of the professionals who have upheld its 
traditional liberalism, by fighting out the struggle for power. 
Our running about in confusion only serves our adversary's 
advantage. We have to read again the LDP's platform, and only 
those who resonantly agree with that spirit are urged to unite 
to create a new future. It does no good to follow the examples 
of the new political parties because they are popular. I think 
it is important to clarify the difference in vision and the 
different way of exercising power. As a result, if we come 
together in our ambitions, it is more than natural for us to 
sweat it out for the people, discarding all the past 
complications. 
<H5>  `Good Power' and `Bad Power' </H5>
  I was one of the three candidates, including Messrs. 
Miyazawa and Mitsuzuka, for the LDP presidency two years ago. 
At that time, I put forward "Honne [real intention] and 
Determined Leadership" as my slogan. To develop Japan as a new 
world state, I offered the following as the essence of my 
vision: One, changing Japan to an honorable nation among the 
comity of nations; two, building up a social system in which a 
free economy with a society guided by the greying generation 
does not lose its vitality; three, bringing forth a society in 
which an affluent heart is enjoyed in daily life. I appealed 
that now is the time for Japan to challenge the taboo that it is 
a historical inevitability that a prosperous nation will perish. 
  At that time, the Keiseikai was the largest faction and, 
as a matter of reality, it was impossible to become the LDP 
president without the faction's support. Press reports had it 
that Mr. Ozawa, acting Keiseikai chairman, understood my 
assertions. Indeed, Mr. Ozawa's "A Plan To Reform Japan" has 
many points in common with my thoughts. The election ended with 
the formation of the Miyazawa cabinet, at the nomination of Mr. 
Kanemaru. Since then, I have found myself many times in 
agreement with Mr. Ozawa in political ideal and policy matters. 
  The reports that Mr. Ozawa and I might take the same action 
because of these factors are based only on an aspect of politics 
at this time. Contrary to many things in common in policy 
matters, I am saying this because our way of thinking is 
drastically different as it stands now about how to use power to 
realize these policies. However the mass media may agitate, I do 
not think actual politics would work without ideals and policy 
going hand-in-hand with the way of using power to materialize 
them. 
  The realities of power that make the eight-group coalition 
possible do not match with my ideals. I mean that I cannot 
participate in power that is supported by the majority which 
includes not only the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], 
which is out of the question, but also Soka Gakkai [a large 
religious group which supports Komeito -- Clean Government 
Party], the exclusive --going against the principles of 
liberalism -- organization of the faithful of the Ikeda sect 
that was excommunicated by Nichiren Shoshu [religious group]. 
The word "power" tends to be misunderstood, but I want to 
distinguish it clearly between "good power" and "bad power." Out 
of the question is worldly power in pursuit of status, honor, 
and gains. What I mean by "good power" is a democratic process 
with the aim of materializing policies. It requires me to win 
the elections and control the majority--but in doing so, the 
basic standards of following rules and sharing the same ideals 
must be observed. 
  Politics without ideals nor policies would do no good, but 
if 
politics can be managed only with ideals and policies, 
professors can make a prime minister. On the other hand, those 
bent on getting ministerial posts in pursuit of worldly position 
and gain are what they call politicians. What I call "good 
power" is the power -- the technique that materializes political 
ideals and policies step by step through compromise with reality. 
  Someone said to me: "Mr. Watanabe, Max Weber had said the 
same thing as you say." According to them, Weber is quoted to 
have said: "Politics means efforts to get a share of power and 
exert influence over the distribution of power. It is a matter 
of religion what the entities that exercise power should be." 
Mr. Ozawa's "beliefs" -- as I interpret by reading his "A Plan 
To Reform Japan" -- have many identical things with my 
"beliefs." As the matter stands now, "the efforts to exert 
influence over the distribution of power" are not the same. 
However, it may be permissible to a certain degree as was seen 
in the case of bartering policies with other parties when the 
consumption tax was passed. 
<H5>  Why Leadership Was Lost </H5>
  The LDP's ideals, as can be defined from its platform, may 
be 
summarized as follows: Social order should be based on free 
competition; importance should be attached to public interests 
as well as human rights; the economy should be a market economy; 
and in diplomacy, national interests should be considered within 
world harmony. The actual LDP policies, however, were quite 
different. And many of them succeeded. During the postwar 
period when growth was considered a priority and when Japan 
attempted to get rid of poverty, growth was encouraged by 
providing subsidies and controlling free competition. And many 
such handicaps still remain in today's Japan whcih has become an 
economic power. In reality, it is a fact that the peculiar 
situation that Japan is a defeated nation has saved her from 
sharing the costs of international society, and that momentum 
continues as short-sighted insistence on national interests. 
  It was always the LDP that has dealt with such reforms with 
the ideal of a political party professing traditional liberalism 
as its foundation. These are the Japan-U.S. declaration of 
alliance during the Ohira cabinet, the civilian 
vitality-introducing programs and administrative reforms during 
the Nakasone cabinet, the introduction of the consumption tax 
during the Takeshita cabinet, undertaking the peacekeeping 
operations during the Miyazawa cabinet and so on. I am 
astonished to find men of various political parties that 
expressed opposition to these reforms at those times are sitting 
in the cabinet ministers' seats of the coalition government, 
ignoring past claims and tactfully using statements as a 
minister on one occasion and beliefs as a politician on another. 
  Today when Japan has become a world economic power and the 
world structure based on the Cold War between the U.S. and the 
Soviet Union has collapsed, the LDP and few of the then 
opposition parties had ideas to change diplomatic and economic 
policies and social systems. The problem was that some members 
of the LDP were dissatisfied with the speed with which reforms 
were undertaken. One of the reasons behind the delay in the 
reforms can be traced back to a lack of leadership. 
  I, myself, hate talking in a roundabout way as well as in 
indecisive terms. There were times when realization of policies 
was delayed and the nation despaired in the confusion due to a 
lack of leadership. 
  In "A Plan To Reform Japan" are found the following 
passages: "The power of the LDP regime is divided between the 
LDP and the government;" and "it is the problem of how to free 
the prime minister's power which has been contained by 
convention and bad customs under the 1955 order." As Mr. Ozawa 
acknowledges, in the LDP prior to the Tanaka cabinet there was 
vitality originating from severe power struggles between the 
mainstream and nonmainstream factions as well as the leadership 
of the party president-prime minister. 
  Why did that leadership disappear? The primary reason was 
the two-fold structure of power that Keiseikai of the Tanaka 
faction, the most influential and largest intraparty faction, 
gained giving it the key to decide who would head the regime 
without producing prime ministers, except Mr. Takeshita, thus 
actually controlling the party. The power structure of the 
coalition government is quite similiar. Political parties are 
the foundation of the parliamentary cabinet system, and they are 
the eight groups that form the coalition. But their power and 
the power of the Prime Minister's Office are apparently divided. 
It is the same structure of the then LDP which was the target 
of criticism. I wonder how Mr. Ozawa is assessing this point. 
  Keiseikai, however, was split by the unexpected resignation 
of Mr. Kanemaru as the faction's chairman. The best way to 
accelerate reform would have been for Keiseikai to keep a simple 
majority within the party and to maintain its unity without Mr. 
Kanemaru's resignation. I heard that Keiseikai was trying "to 
win 200 Diet members over to its fold" and it might well have 
been true. The second way to accelerate reform without causing 
intraparty friction with other factions is to introduce 
principles of competition in politics under the two-party system 
with Keiseikai in the center. The prerequisite for this idea is 
reform in the electoral system, and the two-party system -- or 
the two great powers -- were to be born as the result of such 
reforms. 
  "The process of political reform I had in mind was, first, 
reforming the system, followed by political realignment," Mr. 
Ozawa honestly confided. If the political world were 
reorganized as the result of changes to the system, a cabinet 
could have never been formed by the eight groups of different 
basic ideas, causing anxiety over crisis management in both 
diplomatic and domestic affairs. 
  Kanemaru's resignation came like a bolt out of the blue. The 
ensuing struggles for leadership and dividing membership into 
"reformists" and "old guards" are hard to understand for 
outsiders. But it was true that they were divided over how to 
proceed with political reform as well as reform in the electoral 
system. Then came the split, the dissolution of the House of 
Representatives, and the formation of the coalition. Mr. Ozawa 
is a man indifferent to such worldly power as honor and status, 
but it seems to me that he is too hastily pursuing "good power." 
  When the eight groups of different basic ideas employ the 
same method to grasp power as intraparty factions do by 
mustering enough supporting members, I wonder which group will 
take the responsibility for the failure of "efforts to exert 
influence over the distribution of power" in executing 
diplomatic as well as domestic affairs, irrespective of the 
righteousness of the "things" over which the power is exercised. 
It is awful to think of it. 
  Mr. Kakuei Tanaka was a politician of foresight and with 
power of execution. Because he was too hasty in seeking power, 
"right things" seemed to have resulted in incompleteness. I am 
the kind of man who has a hasty temper, and therefore I persuade 
myself "less haste, less speed." As for Mr. Ozawa, who is 
reported to be studying the Meiji restoration, I hope and expect 
him to perform the role of Toshimichi Okubo whom he is said to 
respect, not the roles of Shoin Yoshida or Ryoma Sakamoto who 
were too hasty in pursuit of their objectives. Or he may be in 
the state of Takamori Saigo's mind, since he has no big ambition 
for worldly status. 
<H5>  Coalition Cabinet Is `Provisional Being' </H5>
  Assuming the coalition cabinet of eight groups of different 
basic ideas to be an inevitable provisional shape for the 
purpose of speeding up reforms, a question is posed: What 
should the future shape of the Japanese political world be? 
Before answering that question, let me introduce interesting 
exchanges in the Diet. 
  Mr. Imazu [Rep. Hiroshi Imazu of Hokkaido's 2d Electoral 
District] raised a question: "Is the present regime a 
provisional being?" Deputy Prime Minister Hata answered: "It 
could be defined as either a provisional or an unavoidable 
measure." Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura said: "We will hold 
fast to the aspiration that we are not a provisional cabinet." 
Mr. Ochi [Rep. Michio Ochi of Tokyo's 3d Electoral District] 
asked, "What is the central uniting element of the two big 
powers?" and Prime Minister Hosokawa answered: "That depends on 
the kind of political cause put forward at a given moment." 
  I suppose Shinseito has feelings in the back of its mind 
that 
the coalition of the eight groups of different basic ideas is 
not hitting it off together after all. The remarks of Prime 
Minister Hosokawa were beyond political common sense, either due 
to the fact that he unintentionally revealed the lack of basic 
ideas or because he has always been riding on a winning horse. 
As Mr. Ozawa pointed out, "Reform of the electoral system is 
the means for reforming politics, and the objective itself." In 
my opinion, a coalition can be successful when its component 
members share common basic political ideas that direct both 
diplomatic and domestic affairs. 
  Whether the next general election or the one following it 
are held under the new election system depends on the future 
political situation. But the elections under the single-seat 
electoral district system are expected to succeed in fixing the 
present framework of the LDP and non-LDP camps. It is all the 
same, even if the current coalition were an "unavoidable 
measure" or were formed "by a political cause at a given time," 
because the coalition is inevitably required to unite to defeat 
LDP candidates. What is the motive of Shinseito, which 
considers the present situation to be a provisional one and 
which is proceeding with the objective of achieving a 
"nonprovisional" political reorganization? The fact that the 
coalition includes Komeito, which is bent on participating in a 
regime without definite ideas, makes the matter complicated. 
Memoranda of former Komeito Chairman Junya Yano in articles 
published by the monthly magazine BUNGEI SHUNJU vividly expose 
who is exerting influence over both foreign and domestic affairs 
through Soka Gakkai and Komeito. 
  When viewed from the standpoint of the people, I would 
rather 
suggest seeking the possibility of a coalition among those 
sharing common ideas (such as the LDP, Shinseito, Sakigake, and 
the Japan New Party), by discarding personal feelings and 
bygones prior to the elections held under the single-seat 
electoral district system. These were the appeals I made when I 
ran in the last election for the LDP presidency. We have to 
immediately adjust the LDP platform and draw up a chart of 
political reorganization in which the LDP is placed in the 
center as a traditional political party of liberalism determined 
to serve the nation under a vision appropriate to the times. 
  I am confident that the LDP can win back popular support if 
it presents a new vision -- one different from the coalition -- 
with the aim of making Japan more peaceful and its people 
happier than the coalition cabinet can, thus demonstrating the 
LDP to be a traditional political party of liberalism with clear 
responsibility and vitality. If the LDP takes an ambiguous 
attitude devoid of the most important ideals because it is 
distracted by the current situation, its efforts to return to 
power cannot help being termed presumptuous. 
  Because the foreign and domestic policies of the Hosokawa 
cabinet are inconsistent, the LDP is encouraged to be more 
assured about its past achievements. An example is the 
catchphrase of "deregulation." Abolishing and setting up 
controls must be based on firm political ideas. Do the eight 
groups of the coalition have these? 
  How many professional politicians who can carry through the 
persuasion of those concerned (including those supporting the 
coalition) do they have? As for the field of domestic affairs, 
I think that the LDP should have more confidence. 
  In foreign affairs, the concepts of the coalition are more 
contradictory. While Mr. Ozawa insists on Japan's becoming an 
"ordinary nation" with "strong national concepts," Prime 
Minister Hosokawa repeated in his answers at the Diet that he 
"would not take that course." With respect to this point, the 
SDJP is out of the question, and Komeito is ominous because it 
takes elastic stands. Therefore, I advise the LDP to be more 
confident about this. 
  The eight groups of the coalition are in a state of chaos in 
which "those who give priority to popular opinion" and "those 
who give priority to the public interest" are mixed together in 
terms of the basis of their political thinking. I predict that 
they will come to a deadlock sooner or later. And that is a 
problem for the Japanese people. To avoid that situation, the 
LDP must do its utmost to let the people know the merits of the 
LDP's policies. I plan to make appeals to the nation myself to 
clarify our foreign and domestic visions and policies in 
concrete terms. Those assembled under the banner of traditional 
liberalism must be confident and must make efforts to win back 
"good power." 
  To not be carried away by the atmosphere and to not forget 
essential things, I want to mention several points proposed by 
the Hosokawa cabinet. Because the coalition maintains that it 
will continue the ideas and policies of the LDP regime, I agree 
with its catchphrases -- all of them. But the problem is how to 
carry them out, not the proposals. It is important to pay 
attention to essential problems and not to pay too much 
attention to winning popularity. 
<H5>  Government Political Reform Plan Inclined To Control </H5>
  There is no perfect election system. The current 
medium-sized election district system has both merits and 
shortcomings. To our regret, both voters and politicians became 
used to the system because both of them have employed this 
system for so long. Most scandals were the results of their 
failures. The medium-sized election district system alone 
cannot be blamed. Rather, all the political parties have become 
accustomed to the situation in which there have been no changes 
of government since 1955, and then the dregs of the 1955 order 
overflowed. 
  The LDP's perennial hold on power is not the sole fault of 
the LDP. I think that it was due to the good-for-nothing 
political parties headed by the SDPJ which have been unable to 
present better policies than the LDP to the people and to win 
their support. Also, the government actually did change hands 
under the medium-sized election district system. But it is an 
extremely unstable regime composed of a coalition of eight 
groups with different basic ideas. Currently, discord is evident 
in the Diet debates, and I wonder how the Japanese Government 
would respond to such hypothetical situations as military 
tensions on the Korean peninsula or demands for peacekeeping 
operations. On the assumption that the United States will throw 
the SII [Japanese-U.S. structural impediments initiative] 
fastball, I think that there should be a stable government 
responsible for Japan's fate. 
  Since the LDP is reflecting upon the habitual practice and 
inertia [idling away while having done nothing new] it enjoyed 
during its long period of one-party rule, it is inevitable that 
political reform will seek a situation under which two political 
parties with stable foundations for establishing an 
administration will work hard together to respond to the wishes 
of the people. For that purpose, I personally consider the 
single-seat election district system to be the best system. In 
consideration of the small political parties, however, the LDP 
proposes the heiritsu system [which adds the element of 
proportional representation], and I think that this is the 
second-best plan. 
  Under the medium-sized election district system, a plural 
number of candidates from the same party compete in the same 
electoral district to make it an election of individuals. 
Contrarily, under the single-seat election district system, 
political parties are in charge of the election campaign. 
Voters can vote only for candidates who political parties have 
nominated for their districts, and party organizations rather 
than individuals become the center of activity. Therefore, 
political parties have to decide such matters as the selection 
of candidates, the method of the election campaign, and the 
distribution of election funds and personnel in accordance with 
open and fair rules. 
  Under the medium-sized election district system, candidates 
and voters both have freedom of activity and room to act as 
freely as they like. Therefore, in some cases, voters and 
candidates abuse their freedom under the medium-sized election 
system, and this excessive freedom has come under criticism. In 
a free economy, speculations and corners are permitted. But, 
for that matter, those who go to extremes will be criticized as 
"wicked merchants." It is a matter of business morals and the 
human nature of individuals. 
  Under a rationing system, "wicked merchants" may be 
eradicated, but the situation without them may be no better than 
the situation with them, for the benefits of a free economy will 
be lost while black marketeering and the corruption of the 
bureaucracy begin. Now that a reform of the system has begun, 
close attention must be paid so as to not lose sight of the 
important and essential things. 
  There are two things that I worry about. One is that the 
council under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister's Office 
controlled by ruling parties is commissioned to zone single-seat 
election districts. The other concerns subsidizing political 
parties and especially the use of such funds, the auditing of 
which the Audit Board plans to carry out. It is feared that 
both of these contain a lot of systematic possibilities under 
which the activities of opposition parties and politicians might 
be interfered with by public authorities, especially the ruling 
parties. The coalition's political reform plan gives off a hint 
that it would be a controlling one. On the other hand, it must 
be pointed out that political parties have no legal 
personalities; they are not juridical persons under civil law. 
The land and head office buildings occupied by the LDP, SDPJ, 
Komeito, and so on are owned by third persons, and legal 
violations are committed by renting them for unreasonably low 
rents. As an old Chinese fable says, he who suggests it should 
be the first to do it -- and political parties should be given 
legal personalities to make their responsibilities clear before 
subsidizing them. I think that something like a "political 
party law" is necessary to make the rights and responsibilities 
of political parties clear and at the same time to protect them 
from public authorities. 
  Now I will repeat what I have been saying for years. 
However good are the reforms of the system, they will be 
rendered useless unless the voters and politicians who utilize 
them are awakened to what they can and should do. Politicians 
are said to reflect the voters who choose them. Politicians 
worthy of the voters will be elected for the districts where 
voters cast their votes only on the basis of the legislators' 
own activities. In parallel with efforts to let people know the 
role played by politics, nationwide campaigns to clean up 
elections and the political world should be carried out, just 
like the traffic safety campaigns conducted from elementary 
schools to regional communities. However heavy are the 
penalties that are applied, traffic accidents will continue to 
increase if traffic safety campaigns and education are stopped. 
I earnestly propose that national campaigns be launched to 
clean up the activities concerning elections. 
<H5>  "Lessening Public Intervention" Rather Than "Deregulation" </H5>
  Japan's autonomy system is called "sanwari jichi" 
[literally, 
30-percent autonomy, referring to the situation of local 
governments losing independence and power]. It is said that you 
do not have to be a governor to know that the central government 
intrudes too much. Authorities for granting permits and licenses 
and the source of funding are concentrated at the 
central-government level. Therefore, it is hard for local 
governments to proceed with administrations which match the 
localities. The idea that projects and funds for projects 
directly connected to people's daily lives are to be 
decentralized to the local autonomous level is very welcome. 
  In this case, it has not been clearly visualized, for words 
proceed ahead of concrete plans concerning what level of local 
autonomy is being considered for decentralization. In "A Plan 
To Reform Japan," a concrete concept was made public under which 
the country would be divided into 300 "cities" -- in other 
words, into living administration areas. Although it is not 
discussed, it is thought that prefectures will remain as they 
are today, but it is not clear which will receive the 
decentralized authority and funds -- "cities" or prefectures. 
It is not clear either what will become of chartered cities 
[cities with a population of over 500,000 designated by the 
Local Government Act to have a status similar to that of 
prefectural governments] that are bigger than the new "cities." 
  Relations between governors and newly established "cities" 
pose a big problem. If governors are to be entrusted with 
decentralized authority, "cities" which are really in charge of 
local autonomy will be deprived of the authority to grant 
permits and licenses and the source of funding to new local 
governors, although they will be freed from the supervision of 
the central government. 
  I think it is rather important to drastically transfer the 
authority of prefectures to cities, towns, and villages. 
National government officials cite adjustments among prefectures 
and unified standards applicable nationwide as reasons for 
opposing decentralization. Similarly, opposition may be raised 
by prefectural governors because adjustments are necessary among 
"cities" and for administrations covering areas larger than 
"cities." Meanwhile, a province-state system is proposed in 
view of the need for adjustments among prefectures and 
administrations for areas bigger than prefectures. I am all for 
decentralization, but for the benefit of the inhabitants I think 
it necessary to review and adjust relations between cities, 
towns, and villages, and between prefectures, provinces, and 
states. 
  Everybody says that the natural course to follow is to 
"transfer sources of revenue to local governments, in proportion 
to the amount of responsibilities to be transferred to 
localities from the central government." But the matter is not 
so simple. Imagine that certain tax sources are transferred to 
prefectures or cities, towns, and villages. They may be good as 
sources of revenue in such rich metropolises and prefectures as 
Tokyo, Osaka, and other rich cities, towns, and villages, but 
this might not be true in the case of Shimane Prefecture, where 
the authorities to be transferred would not bring in adequate 
sources of revenue. To solve the problem, functions must be 
sought to adjust sources of revenue in localities. At present, 
such roles are handled by the Ministries of Home Affairs and 
Finance. Decentralization contributes to strengthening the 
authority of the Ministries of Finance and Home Affairs in 
relations between the central and local governments and in 
boosting the powers of finance bureaus of prefectural 
governments in relations between prefectural governments and the 
administrations of cities, towns, and villages. 
  Contrary to the fact that central government agencies have 
exerted influence over local autonomy through subsidies with 
strings attached, now, for example, the status of such 
ministries as agriculture, forestry and fisheries, construction, 
transportation, and health and welfare, and so on, will be 
downgraded while the power of the Ministries of Finance and Home 
Affairs, which will handle sources of funds in the form of 
outright grants without strings attached, will be increased. 
Images and words seem to be exceeding the importance and 
desirability of decentralization. It is hoped that concrete 
proposals will be made. In my opinion, the realistic thing to 
do first is to transfer as much authority of the central 
government as possible to prefectures, and as much prefectural 
authority as possible to cities, towns, and villages. 
  Young children are taken care of by their parents. They are 
taught at schools. But they may be interfered with at times and 
regulated by guidance and rules. When they are grown up, nobody 
will help them, although they will be free to do as they wish. 
The selfishness of wanting to be free to do what one wishes and 
at the same time to be helped will not be allowed. During its 
poverty-stricken postwar period, Japan persisted in its priority 
production efforts to catch up with and surpass the United 
States. Both enterprises and individuals grew up under the 
government's protection, assistance, and regulation. Because it 
has become the world's top economic power, Japan wants to "act 
like and be treated" as an adult, and that is what deregulation 
is, in my opinion. 
  There are plenty of annoyingly persistent and 
good-for-nothing systems, as well as complicated procedures to 
receive permits and licenses. It is natural to wish for 
efficient systems after getting rid of the aforementioned bad 
systems or deregulating them. I support wholeheartedly the 
revision or abolition of systems unsuited to the times, because 
these are the fundamentals of administrative reform. The 
fundamental principles for carrying out reforms are free choice 
and personal responsibility. One cannot hope for both a 
relaxing of regulations and at the same time continued 
protection and subsidies. The catchphrase "deregulation" may 
receive a favorable popular response, but we have to clarify the 
principle of self-responsibility. Otherwise, we will end up 
with a whitewashing and say that we are generally in favor of 
deregulation but that we oppose its details. The most important 
thing is an ability to adjust conflicting interests and to 
demonstrate leadership in decision-making and its execution. I 
doubt whether the eight-group coalition can do this. 
  In my opinion, the correct expression is "relaxing state 
intervention" rather than "deregulation." State intervention in 
a market economy means such things as getting taxes cut by 
special measures, receiving subsidies, getting interest rates 
reduced, having competition controlled, and asking the 
government to revise the system. Realistically speaking, it is 
not so easy to abolish all state intervention and to allow 
everything to be ruled by the market mechanism. On the 
contrary, there are regulations and intervention which are 
required to meet the demands of times. These are such things as 
welfare in a society whose members are aging, meaning pensions 
and medical care and so on; environmental problems; controls 
over private rights to land, meaning housing problems; city 
planning, and so on. Whether these are needed or not is a 
political decision, but the consensus of opinion is that a 
number of outdated regulations and instances of intervention 
continue. 
  When everything is left to the tender mercies of the market 
mechanism and free competition, the strong will survive while 
the weak are sacrificed, and colossal monopolies will appear. 
It is a problem to discern the "truly weak" from the 
"self-styled weak." The United States has difficulty as a 
multiracial country, and one of the reasons behind its social 
unrest is said to be the lack of state intervention in the form 
of pensions and insurance which apply comprehensively to the 
whole people. It is well known that the Clinton administration 
has launched a review of the social security system. It is 
natural that assistance and regulations will be introduced. 
Japan, however, cannot compare to the United States in terms of 
strict government monitoring and regulations against giant 
monopolies. 
  Finally, to recognize public intervention, it is better 
to do it in a way that the nation chooses and is thereby held 
responsible for the choice. Compared to granting subsidies, 
providing favorable treatment in taxation and interest rates is 
easier to make self-responsibility apparent. Money borrowed 
even at low interest rates must be paid back, while grants do 
not. Therefore, high-rate subsidies tend to create excessive 
investments. There is nothing more costly than attaining 
something for nothing. Instead of widening the beneficiary range 
for medical insurance, it is better to consider making private 
medical insurance replete through favorable treatment in 
taxation. I would rather place emphasis on indirect 
intervention through market economics than through direct 
intervention. 
<H5>  Do Not Make Trade Surplus a Scape Goat </H5>
  Japan's postwar diplomacy has consistently made note of its 
peculiar situation that it is a defeated nation, and has 
demanded exceptional treatment from international rule on the 
grounds that its economy has not yet been rehabilitated. Thus, 
Japan has succeeded in its maneuver to become the world's second 
largest economic power. Now her movements and actions tend to 
exert influence upon international society. Accordingly, Japan 
is meeting a time when it has to make its mission and roles in 
international society clear and fulfill its contribution in 
accordance with the benefits gained from international society. 
That is the condition for Japan to enjoy peace and guarantee 
prosperity to its people. In the economic field, it has already 
achieved plenty of records, but the problem is contribution in 
noneconomic fields. It was the reason why I, during the LDP 
presidential election campaign, stated: "Steer away from 
economic power without ideals." 
  The collapse of the Soviet Union and disappearance of the 
U.S.- USSR Cold War structure brought about the downfall of 
peace through power tension. At present, a new world order 
centered around the United Nations is being sought. While I was 
foreign minister, Japan took a new step forward by participating 
in UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) and UN Peacekeeping Forces 
(PKF). Under that decision, a number of Japanese shed sweat and 
even lost precious lives in foreign lands. Because of these 
efforts, Japan's international status in all diplomatic fields, 
including economics, has improved greatly. It has become easier 
to proceed with diplomatic negotiations. Dispatches of 
Self-Defense Forces on PKO and PKF missions are not conducted by 
the will of the Japanese Government only, but with the request 
of the United Nations and the consent of the country concerned. 
Therefore it does not violate Article Nine of the Constitution 
at all. The legislation to make the dispatch possible was 
drafted under such concepts and enacted through the Diet's 
consent. 
  In addition to PKO and PKF, UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali 
proposes the creation of the UN Alert Forces for the purpose of 
maintaining order by preventing and terminating conflicts 
through intervention. There remain many problems for Japan to 
discuss with the United States such as transferring the command 
of its troops to the United Nations to secure its influence in 
maintaining world order. Sooner or later, Japan will be asked 
to participate in accordance with Article 42 of the UN Charter. 
  I think Japan should naturally take part in them, rather 
than 
insisting on its peculiar situation. But as for its handling, 
it annoys me that the eight groups that comprise the coalition 
government are split in their opinion, despite the fact that the 
matter is related to Japan's survival. Prime Minister Hosokawa 
continues to make negative responses, and if he means it, the 
coalition should be dissolved in view of a parliamentary cabinet 
system. 
  In "A Plan to Reform Japan," an amendment to Article Nine of 
the Constitution and another plan under new legislation have 
been proposed from the legislative point of view, to open the 
way to participate in the UN Alert Forces. From both a 
realistic point of view and from the Constitution's 
interpretation, I do not deem a constitutional amendment 
necessary. The problem is that Mr. Ozawa, chief secretary of 
the coalition's nucleus government party, and Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, who is supported by the coalition parties, have 
different opinions. Japan, as it is, can hardly break away from 
"an economic power without ideals" to become "a country that 
will work hard with the world." 
  As it stands now, the economic problems of the world cannot 
be discussed without Japan, which has become an economic power. 
Because of its economic power, Japan is considered as a possible 
permanent member to the United Nations Security Council, an 
international political organization. Japan could devote itself 
to its policy of economic growth with light armament, because it 
was protected under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the U.S. 
nuclear umbrella during the U.S.-USSR Cold War. As a result, a 
lightly-armed Japan with offensive economic power made its 
appearance. As a consequence, Japan's trade surplus increased 
year after year and as for now, the trade surplus problem has 
become one of the biggest issues between Japan and the United 
States. 
  The phenomenon, like the sole winner of a mahjong game, 
brought Japan a series of difficult negotiations in maintaining 
the free trade system. It is my opinion that the free trade 
system is fundamental to Japanese prosperity and that all out 
efforts must be made to protect the system to serve the national 
interest. 
  To show that Japan is a country that competes on equal 
terms, it has to respond as much as possible to the demands for 
liberalizing and opening its markets. To transfer the huge 
trade surplus earned by private enterprises to public assistance 
programs, such as funds for foreign economic cooperation, people 
must understanding democracy because they bear the burden. That 
may be a difficult problem, but the government must persuade the 
people to carry it out. And this can be effectively used as a 
means to achieve new diplomatic objectives centering around 
developing nations. Surplus reflux is an important point in 
protecting the free trade system. 
  However, setting up import quotas of a controlled trade 
nature and imposing compulsory export quotas to reduce surplus 
will lead to denial of free trade itself. It is necessary to 
see Japan's future in a broader perspective. One of the 
important points in Japan's diplomacy is Japan-U.S. relations. 
The United States is an indispensable country for Japan. With 
the most friendly and most important nation, it is necessary to 
negotiate through the most powerful negotiating means. Since 
the biggest issue pending between the two nations is the trade 
problem, Japan's negotiations with the United States will focus 
on reducing Japan's colossal trade surplus. In relation to the 
degree of Japanese cooperation in such international 
contributions centering around the United Nations as PKO, PKF, 
and so on and its participation in such international schemes as 
providing assistance to Russia and so on, it is shuddering to 
imagine what the Japanese position would be if it did not have a 
trade surplus in view of its present light-armament status. 
  There are two directions to consider for the future. One is 
to boost negotiating power in noneconomic fields and another is 
to maintain negotiating power in economic fields. If unequal 
treatment of foreign enterprises and foreigners exists at home 
in the economic field, then they should be treated equally. 
Further, the Japanese systems themselves should be changed one 
by one to systems that can pass in the international community. 
At the same time, research and development of new technology 
should be expedited and the tax system should be revised so that 
the desire to work is not hurt and productivity is improved. 
Efforts to promote superiority at all times in international 
competition must not be neglected. Blame must not be laid on 
trade surplus, because surplus earned through fair competition 
is the means of survival for lightly armed Japan. 
<H5>  Measures Against Recession Transcend Political Reform </H5>
  The biggest concern of the people for now is not transition 
to the single-member election district system nor is it 
providing public subsidies to political parties. Rather, it is 
the emergence as quickly as possible, from what they call the 
biggest and longest postwar recession. 
  I have continued to warn that the abrupt extermination of 
the 
bubble economy inevitably accompanies as many aftereffects. And 
that is exactly what happened. Two years ago when those 
aftereffects began to show, I made a series of proposals: 
Interest rates must be lowered in the spring of 1992 and stocks 
must be bought with public funds in the summer of 1992. While 
my proposal with regard to stocks was partially implemented, 
lowering interest rates was forestalled, thus making every 
ensuing rate reduction less effective. 
  Government policy decisions tend to get delayed because 
consultations must take place with those, most often 
bureaucrats, who have a good grasp of statistics. To make 
matters worse, there is the Diet, a time-consuming institution. 
In the twinkling of an eye, three or four months are wasted. 
Budgets for things like emergency measures should be quickly 
dealt with, as long as their objectives are not mistaken. 
Perfectionism is not required. Such efforts can be done in the 
deliberation process. Specifically effective medicines do no 
good if taken after the illness conditions have already 
deteriorated. 
  Another reminder is that the order of priority should not be 
mistakenly handled out of concern for saving face. 
  Political reform can be summarized as bringing about a 
single 
member election district with proportional representation 
system, national treasury subsidies [to political parties], and 
controls over enterprise contributions. They are not so 
imperative that they have to be settled within two or three 
months. The most imperative and important problem is how to 
cope with the current recession. I am dubious about whether the 
government really understands the problem's importance. 
  In relation to stock price policies, the government should 
have publicly announced its intention to buy back NTT [Nippon 
Telephone and Telegraph] stock at half-price, 2.55 million yen, 
at which price the government had originally sold it, when the 
price dropped to 600,000 or 700,000 yen. That would have become 
the bottom price [for the stock]. In theory, it worked out for 
those who continued to possess the stocks until the government 
announcement, but what about those who had already sold them at 
a loss. The same thing holds for the land tax system which was 
enforced to prevent speculators from earning big money from 
sky-rocketing land prices. But when the land prices continue to 
drop and land transactions drastically decrease, antibubble 
measures continue to remain in effect. The way things are, 
business conditions will never be expected to improve. 
  Some people would make the immediate rebuttal: "But what 
will 
you do when land prices go up again?" Raising interest rates 
and controls over loans can be done in a breath. 
  If it were found that antirecession budgets were 
formulated in excess, they could be immediately controlled. It 
takes several months to formulate budgets, but their execution 
can be suspended in a day. The government cannot function 
smoothly when it is split by those who assert priority in 
fairness and those who advocate placing priority in recession 
fighting measures. No leadership can be displayed in recovering 
the economy unless political groups sharing the same views form 
a ruling party and a government. 
  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is urged to refrain from 
permanently crying "hi-jimin [non-LDP]," for the benefit of the 
nation as a whole. We will not spare cooperation from outside 
the cabinet, if it really serves the national interest. 
  I am afraid that trade union confederation leaders are 
deviating from their professed line. They attempt to take the 
initiative in reorganizing political circles, but I do not think 
lower-echelon union members would listen to what their top 
people had to say. I do not think union members could be 
subjugated to the orders from above, orders like recommending 
Komeito [Clean Government Party] in the A District without 
regard to who is on the ticket, a Shinseito candidate in the B 
District, a Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] candidate in the C 
District, a SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] candidate in 
the D District, and so on. That sort of thinking contributed to 
a reduction in the SDPJ's strength by half, which was to our 
advantage. Strong opposition to such ideas is reported within 
unions. It is all right for them to demand tax cuts but I would 
rather propose union fee reductions before making such demands. 
  Prefectural employees told me that they pay 60,000 to 80,000 
yen in union fees annually. Since they are banned from going on 
strike, a two-thirds cut in union fees would provide them with 
the same benefit as a tax reduction in the amount of 40,000 to 
50,000 yen. The supreme leaders above the clouds are unaware 
that a great number of union members did not want to become 
members in the first place and that they want out. If the 
leaders are planning to use them in elections as if they were 
moving chessmen at will, more union members will desert the 
organizations. The current union leaders are excessively 
committed to political intervention. The cry of "hi-jimin" 
alone does not bring about recovery in business conditions and 
increases in basic wage rates. It is better to ask the opinions 
of intelligent union members. 
<H5>  Putting the Cart Before the Horse? </H5>
  With market opening progressing, Japanese enterprises with 
the same line of business are now engaged in life-or-death 
battles. Enterprises are now becoming labor-management 
communities. 
  The current difficulties can hardly be overcome unless labor 
and management cooperate more closely. When competing firms are 
bent on expanding sales, how can union leaders expect union 
members of competing companies to make concerted efforts to back 
the union-designated candidate. It may end up putting the cart 
before the horse. I would advise Rengo [Confederation of Labor 
Unions] to refrain from engaging in excessive election 
campaigns. Union members say they are against Rengo's using 
their high union fees to meddle in elections. 
  Finally, the fluke the Hosokawa cabinet brought about was 
not 
the expulsion of the LDP from the government, but letting the 
SDPJ eat the forbidden fruit and emasculating it. This applies 
at least to those holding cabinet portfolios and seniors on the 
portfolio waiting list who are well-behaved because they thirst 
after positions and greed. It may well be anticipated that all 
such things as PKF, atomic power plant construction, the 
Self-Defense Force's purchase of AWACS' [Advanced Warning 
Airborne Control System], and partial liberalization of the rice 
market will go well. I do not care whether the Hosokawa 
cabinet's political reform bill comes through before the 
year-end or not, if most of the pending difficult problems are 
solved, for which I would not spare my cooperation from outside 
the cabinet. I want to make this prediction: Emergence from 
depression and prevention of huge unemployment by industrial 
restructuring will never succeed through "schoolgirlish fancy 
slogans like "hi-jimin," senility emerging from thirst after 
power and greed, and flattery to win popularity alone." Mr. 
Ozawa is an unparalleled person in thinking of Japan's future 
and in courage, power of execution, and skills in bringing about 
alliances. For him to achieve greater success, I wish for him 
to make efforts to respect principles and rules and to be 
tolerant, but not to take the course of excessive expansionism 
like Mr. Kakuei Tanaka once did, and not to exude the impression 
of a secretive and arbitrary person. A man's strong and weak 
points coexist and they are like both sides. 
  It has been said that life is like walking with a heavy 
burden upon one's back, one should not be hasty and excessive. 
  I dare wish him to be more prudent and pray for more great 
activities of a good fellow.

  [Text] Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], in an interview with YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN on 27 December, said it was highly possible that if the 
political reform bills failed to pass the current special Diet 
session, either the lower house would be dissolved or the 
cabinet would resign en masse. 
  He added emphatically: "Judging from the way the economy 
looks now, unemployment will peak around February or March. We 
must not create a governmental vacuum now by dissolving the 
Diet. We must think of a way to avoid such a situation." 
  "That is one of the reasons why I say the bill to prevent 
corruption must be acted on first," he said. 
  Murayama's remarks made it clear that he wants the ruling 
and 
opposition parties to reach agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by reporters Yasushi Kudo, Shizuo Tazaki] </F>
  [Excerpts] An incumbent cabinet member says: "We were 
unable to get to the heart of the problem." Faced with the 
negative effects of deregulation and resistance by the 
bureaucracy, no bold policy is forthcoming. Bureaucratic 
opinions aside, the global market presses for deregulation. No 
budget progress is possible and there is no room for a 
choice. 
  Why is deregulation necessary now? Why do the corporate 
managers seek deregulation in unison? Some cases are perceived 
of those who seek expansion of their vested interests and make 
self-centered contentions. However, there is an undercurrent of 
reverberating cries that seek a breakthrough in the serious 
blockage of Japan's economy. 
  The present business recession is not as simple as portrayed 
by the optimistic view in the Economic White Paper as 
"relatively large in the postwar years." Unlike the Economic 
White Paper which incorrigibly forecasts a "recovery from the 
last half of FY93," the managers closely sense a potential for 
the worst recession in postwar years. Above all, they are 
troubled by an unprecedented lack of clarity. 
  Conditions now are worse than the recession following the 
oil 
shocks. After the oil shocks, such measures as downsized 
management, massive and intensive exports, and strong budget 
actions were permitted. Today, however, due to the high yen 
resulting from the trade frictions of the past 20 years, exports 
are providing no relief. In addition to a holding balance of 190 
trillion yen in national bonds, the fiscal situation with a drop 
of several trillion yen in tax revenues is at a standstill. If 
downsizing is pushed, a company's loss in volume means a 
personnel cut, and reduced investment will cause a contractile 
spiral that lowers macrobusiness. Moreover, financing which 
should support the struggling real economy has been hurt and has 
lost its leeway. 
  The greatest change of all is the loss of confidence by the 
managers. The fighting spirit that faced the oil shocks and 
high-yen recession is now rarely seen. One reason is that the 
endurance of the high yen has reached its limit. The experience 
of mistakes during the bubble has dulled the edge of judgment. 
  Amid these circumstances, it seems impossible to escape from 
the contractile spiral unless a modest market is created. 
Conditions to utilize the positive aspects of the high yen must 
be formed. The network of protective regulations formed to 
protect vested interests will then become merely "overheavy 
armor." Regardless of how highly efficient and splendid the 
armor, it is just a white elephant if the warriors who wear it 
cannot move in it. Japan's economy will choke to death without 
progress in deregulation. 
<H5>  Although It Is a Small Step... </H5>
  The Hosokawa administration was forced to set forth 
deregulation as the centerpiece of an ad hoc economy policy, 
which inherently cannot serve as a business stimulus measure. It 
conversely exposed its do-nothing posture regarding the present 
fiscal impasse and the record low business level. 
  Moreover, it has ended in half measures in its policy which 
should be based on a long-term vision of deregulation. 
  The Hosokawa administration positions deregulation, its 
centerpice measure, as the "first step in reforming the economic 
structure." However, as far as the recently announced measure 
indicates, it continues to be a shortcut reappraisal under 
bureaucratic leadership, and not even a sense of its direction 
surfaces. 
  Led by cabinet members who received repeated instructions 
from the Prime Minister's Residence, the targets of deregulation 
have increased from the original 60 items to 94 items. The prime 
minister himself reportedly stated that "we will not let 
deregulation end up according to the proposal by the 
bureaucrats." However, there was ultimately not a single item of 
bold deregulation. 
  Chairman Shinji Shimizu of Life Corporation says: 
"Regulation 
means bureaucrats and, as long as the number of bureaucrats does 
not decrease, it is essentially impossible to expect the 
bureaucrats to deregulate. With the majority of the regulations 
essentially unnecessary, what is needed is not easing but 
abolition." 
  Naturally, in this regard also, there was reportedly a 
fierce 
exchange between the bureaucrats, who basically do not wish to 
deregulate, and the prime minister's staff. 
  Displeasure regarding the "cold attitude, considering our 
long acquaintance," was indicated by the bureaucracy also to 
Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations], which 
requested 30 supplemental items and threw the ball into the lap 
of the Prime Minister's Residence. There was also protest from 
the industrial organizations (which are under Keidanren's wing) 
that "we do not recall requesting deregulation to that extent." 
  Ukehisa Iwakami, managing director of the Japan Department 
Stores Association, remarked about the recent measure as 
follows: "The trunk of the tree called regulation remains. Only 
a few branches and leaves were trimmed." That is because, after 
the conclusions and review directions on most of the 94 items 
were decided, they ended up as merely an array of deferred 
items. [passage omitted] 
  Of course, there are some items that can be partially 
evaluated. For example, items excluded from the application of 
the antimonopoly act could be reevaluated by the end of FY95. 
Customs information could be displayed which has been kept 
secret in the past from the shippers, as if in spite, to protect 
the customs brokers. Also, the submission of value declarations 
on prices of duty-free commodities which accompany the payment 
of consumption taxes could be abolished. [pasage omitted] 
<H5>  "Sanctuary" Remains </H5>
  Conversely, what did not surface in the recent deregulation 
measure may be considered important from the standpoint of 
understanding the lack of meaning and substance in Japan's 
regulations. 
  For example, the Finance Ministry has stated that it will 
ease regulations concerning permits to listed large stores of 
more than 10,000 square meters in floor space that are engaged 
in sales of sake. Actually, notification regarding this already 
went out in July 1993 and, in this case, even if they receive 
permits, they will be unable to sell beer or sake for three 
years. Also, the majority of the medium-sized stores of less 
than 10,000 square meters in space are still unlicensed despite 
petitions by industry circles. 
  For a supermarket to open for business, permits and licenses 
are said to be required on the basis of the Large-Scale Retail 
Store Law and 42 other laws, including the Liquor Tax Act. Daiei 
Inc. has made a prior trial accounting which indicates that, if 
permits and licenses are abolished, commodity prices will drop 
by 0.3 percent due to cost reductions. However, because it had 
already been decided to reappraise the Large-Scale Retail Store 
Law in late January 1994, it was included in the recent list, 
but its reappraisal is limited to reporting criteria for 
store-opening times and days of closure, with abolition not even 
considered. 
  Furthermore, all of these regulations on distribution 
obstruct free entry and competition to excessively protect the 
established dealers. 
  Regarding the problem of farm products, deregulation decided 
by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] 
amounts merely to "flexibility regarding the bidding system for 
semirationed rice" and "promotion of new entry by rice 
retailers." Both are established directions and do not probe 
into the formation of a fair price market for semirationed rice 
or the problem of the Nokyo [Agricultural Cooperative 
Association], which has a monopoly on collection of cargo, 
distribution, and sales. 
  For example, the "flexibility of semirationed rice" included 
in the recent deregulation is merely a study of the past 
regional distribution of listed rice on a prefectural basis, and 
the prevention of self-bidding on Nokyo-related wholesales, 
which has already been pointed out as a violation. Moreover, 
improvement is being deferred with the listed rice itself 
remaining at 25 percent of this year's semirationed rice, of 
which 75 percent is being transacted to the Zenno [National 
Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives] on a relative basis, 
and the price range is limited. 
  Also, deregulation that coerces tied-in domestic-foreign 
sales to protect the domestic producers, such as exempting 
customs duties only for dealers who purchase domestic barley 
germ, indicates a deferment of all deregulation despite the 
wishes of industry circles, and protection of the "sanctuary." 
Regarding these circumstances, a person affiliated with the 
ruling coalition parties remarks: "It was said that, 
individually, farm products are not excepted, but the majority 
of the ruling parties themselves belong to the protectionist 
faction, and they are not acting in unison. The result was that 
a judgment was avoided." 
  Another fact seen in the recent deregulation is that, in the 
same context as the 1985 Nakasone plan on the people's 
livelihood, the easing of the capacity ratio and the easing of 
municipal regulations indicate the surfacing of a deregulation 
policy based on emphasis on supply, with the wishes of industry 
circles and the politicians as the backdrop. 
  Regarding the easing of the capacity ratio, there is still a 
discrepancy between the wishes of the industry circles and the 
government's view, which is oriented toward deregulation 
centered on housing. However, aside from the abolition of the 
surveillance areas where the role has already ended with the 
slump in land prices, the introduction of the incentive called 
the expansion of capacity ratio simply means that the outlook 
for deregulation itself is an anachronism. 
  Amid the present office recession without an exit and the 
slump in land prices, the easing of the capacity ratio is 
nothing more than relief for established land brokers who bought 
up land and are suffering, and expectation of another bubble. 
The 1985 Nakasone plan for the people's livelihood, which began 
under the same economic conditions as the present conditions 
with an expansion of domestic demand and deregulation, pushed 
for the sale of government property and large-scale development 
with a supply theory as its slogan, opening the way for the rise 
of the bubble economy. It is now unrealistic to expect the 
return of such a dream. 
  It is more important to conversely control the cities 
through 
downzoning and to expand the livelihood base. Expansion of 
rights is now totally unrelated to deregulation. 
<H5>  Turning to a Debate on the Abolition of Principle </H5>
  We are not exactly unaware of why the recent deregulation 
remained extremely insufficient. When regulations are eased, the 
domestic-foreign price differential is reduced and new entries 
begin in the established domestic fields, and an extremely large 
deflationary effect appears. 
  Instead, the erasure of domestic-foreign price differentials 
means the appearance of new suppliers despite the continuing 
supply surplus and plant-and-equipment surplus. For example, the 
U.S. machine tool industry is being dealt a devastating blow by 
imported products, and the same thing could happen in Japan if 
it takes the wrong approach. Despite arguments that it could be 
a plus for the consumers, such views would undoubtedly die down 
under conditions where unemployment continues to rise. 
  According to computations by the Japan Research Institute, 
the total demand expansion effect of deregulation is 11.9 
trillion yen, while the employment-creating effect will be an 
increase of 1.02 million workers. However, this is based on the 
calculation of 5.12 million newly employed workers versus 4.1 
millison workers layed off due to the price fall. The new 
employment of 5 million workers is premised on the creation of 
consumer purchasing power with domestic/foreign price 
corrections (lower domestic prices). 
  However, the new purchasing power could not immediately 
provide goods and services of corresponding quality and 
quantity. In contrast, there is a possiblity of quicker layoffs 
due to a domestic-foreign price correction. If there is a fear 
of such a mismatch, it will be extremely difficult to move 
toward deregulation. 
  Moreover, as is clear from the requests by Keidanren, in 
terms of smoothly facilitating deregulation, the logic of the 
supply side is in the forefront. The Large-Scale Retail Store 
Law and the reappraisal of the capacity ratio are typical. 
Although deregulation equaling liberalization in the established 
fields is profitable for the consumers due to lower prices, in 
one aspect the world of the survival of the fittest expands. 
Only the share of the strong rises, but total employment does 
not. On the contrary, when the efficient and strong grow, the 
possibility is great for total employment to drop. The same 
result could be seen regarding elimination of the 
domestic-foreign price differential, which would equate to 
promotion of imports. 
  Consequently, in order to really implement deregulation, it 
is necessary to combine it with the creation of a new market 
that absorbs the micro minuses. It is not possible to find a new 
market immediately. When it is found, everyone will have already 
moved into it. 
  In more acccurate terms, it is futile to expect the 
bureaucrats to form a new market. A free market can only be born 
through trial and error. It means detachment from the 
conventional administrative approach of pushing development 
toward a designated model. Deregulation is therefore a kind of 
cultural revolution. 
  On 18th of this month, Eiji Suzuki, adviser to Asahi 
Chemical 
Industry, and Iwao Nakatani, professor of Hitotsubashi 
University, presented an ad hoc proposal as follows. "Reexamine 
deregulation on a zero base. It is quicker to abolish the 
principles and conversely adopt a cumulative approach." This is 
indeed a revolutionary declaration against the bureaucracy-led 
economy. 
  Certainly, regulations are not all bad. There are necessary 
regulations concerning such irreparable matters as life and 
health. By merely taking the cumulative and restructuring 
approach, it should be possible to eradicate the burdens of the 
economy considerably. 
  However, it is not clear whether the awareness of the 
administration is being changed through what is perceived to be 
bit-by-bit deregulation. The number of permits and licenses 
issued by the government agencies by the end of March 1992 
totaled 10,942. Although the necessity for deregulation was 
pointed out repeatedly on the basis of the 1985 Administrative 
Reform Council report, progress was slow and the number of items 
per se rose bynearly 1,000 items. 
<H5>  Real Test To Come </H5>
  An executive of the Management and Coordination Agency said: 
"Although there is criticism that the majority of the 
deregulation items have appeared previously, it is significant 
that they have been taken up as a government measure. It means 
that it will absolutely be done." In other words, in order to 
move still further, it is necessary for politics to make 
decisions based on a long-term vision. 
  Meanwhile, the private sector has also continued to depend 
on 
regulation, which equates to protection. A certain top manager 
does not hold great expectations when he says: "With 
coordination of the industry circles and rejection of entries 
from the outside left up to the government, they do not wish to 
be tainted themselves. Therefore, deregulations notwithstanding, 
there could not possibly be anything that will discomfort others 
or result in their own loss." 
  In the first place, is it the aim of the current 
deregulation 
to correct the domestic-foreign price differential = expansion 
of imports = reduction of the trade surplus, or to dismantle the 
government-bureaucracy-industry alliance, or to improve the 
so-called low-productivity service industries, or to smooth 
business implementation for the established enterprises? A look 
at the 94 items gives an impression of a hodge-podge of those 
aims. 
  Even the Hosokawa cabinet, which proclaims that "structural 
reform is a historical mission of the cabinet," does not display 
any long-term vision. It gathered a large number of bureaucratic 
old boys and formed the Hiraiwa council to draft a second 
Maekawa report, but debate has barely begun. Although it cannot 
avoid the agricultural problems from the standpoint of 
structural reform, there is still no consensus regarding the 
rice problem within the ruling coalition parties. 
  After announcing an ad hoc measure, Minister Hiroshi Kumagai 
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] said: 
"We were not able to delve into the heart of the problem." This 
was probably not a statement in reference to rice, but even an 
incumbent cabinet member is aware of the inadequacy. Jiro Ushio, 
chairmman of Ushio Inc., voices encouragement to the Hosokawa 
administration, saying: "It is not the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP], which grew with regulation, but the non-LDP that can 
implement structural reform. The non-LDP is attempting to 
formulate a policy that is detached from the `zoku' Diet 
members." However, the details depend on future policy. 
  It must be remembered that the structure--which nurtured 
industries with export competitiveness, provided profits as tax 
revenues, enabled the granting of subsidies, and maintained an 
extremely low unemployment rate compared to Europe and the 
United States--is no longer permitted within the global economy. 
If the external balance deteriorates, the form of support 
through fiscal action cannot be expected to expand beyond the 
present state. The argument to increase national bond issues is 
deep-rooted, but who will buy them? Assuming that we depend on 
fiscal investment funds, there is no guarantee that long-term 
interest rates will not jump up. In addition, fiscal freedom 
will inevitably and increasingly be lost due to interest 
payments. 
  If we should look far for the causes, we will eventually 
arrive at the collapse of the Berlin wall. With the cold war 
over, we were no longer able to presume upon U.S. kindness. From 
that point on, our domestic "socialist domain," wherein the 
means of regulation = protection was maintained, probably ended. 
  Amid this trend, a transition to a self-responsible economy 
that does not depend on the bureaucracy means deregulation. A 
rose-colored dream is by no means promised, but there is no path 
except this for the Hosokawa administration.

  [Excerpts] The 94 items of deregulation announced by the 
Hosokawa administration have raised many ripples throughout 
industrial circles. Such established industries as electric 
power fear a collapse of the established order. The distribution 
and beer industries are awaiting the opening of new business 
opportunities. The situation is likely to have a major impact on 
the customs brokerage system. 
  Furthermore, interestingly enough, such reactions suggest 
the 
future outlook of the various industries. The deregulation is 
actually a deregulation of the established economic order. Let 
us examine the reactions of the principal industries. 
<H5>  Jonan Electric, a Discounter of Cosmetic Products </H5>
  "We are not selling this product. We have been notified by 
the Ministry of Welfare not to undersell it. Those who want the 
product can call the ministry. The number is 3503-1711. Please 
use the counter telephone." This notice is posted in the 
cosmetic sales section on the eighth floor of the Jonan Electric 
Co.'s Shibuya branch. 
  In June this year, Jonan Electric began discount sales of a 
famous foreign brand of cosmetics which it acquired under 
parallel import. In the case of cosmetics imported through 
ordinary channels, they are imported by dealers licensed by the 
Ministry of Welfare, and are sold with labels attached that 
indicate the name of the seller and the component materials. The 
purpose is to protect domestic consumers. However, Jonan 
Electric feared that the importers could pressure the cosmetics 
maker, so it removed the labels and began sales. It was a 
premeditated violation of the rule. 
  Regarding this "violation of the rule," the Ministry of 
Welfare judged that removal of the labels was a violation of the 
Drugs, Cosmetics, and Medical Instruments Law, and ordered a 
halt to the sales through the Tokyo prefectural government. It 
resulted in the aforementioned posted notice. 
  The Ministry of Welfare's explanation is as follows. "We do 
not state that it is wrong to conduct discount sales. We do not 
allow sales of imported cosmetic goods without labeling merely 
in order to protect the consumers. As proof, we do not say 
anything about discount sales by Jonan Electric of cosmetics 
made by Shiseido or Kanebo." 
  President Toshio Miyaji rebuts this, saying, "Even though we 
try to qualify as an importer, the Ministry of Welfare shuts out 
new entries. The consumers are knowledgeable about foreign 
brands of cosmetics, and what we sell are all brands that are 
being sold in Japan. There is also no problem concerning safety." 
  President Miyaji adds, "The Drugs, Cosmetics, and Medical 
Instruments Law is nothing but a law that attaches labels to 
foreign cosmetics, and a large number of Ministry of Welfare 
bureaucrats are being assigned after retirement to companies 
that attach the labels." He also emphasizes: "At this stage, a 
great margin is being added on, and the interests of the 
consumers are being injured." 
  With public opinion seeking inexpensive cosmetics as the 
backdrop, Jonan Electric is aiming for resumption of sales. For 
women, being able to purchase a Chanel lipstick worth 4,000 yen 
at 1,800 yen is quite attractive. However, acquisition of a 
permit as an importer is difficult under the present 
circumstances, and the problem is like to be prolonged. 
<H5>  Kawachiya and Daiei Inc. </H5>
  In July this year, the National Tax Administration Agency 
issued a notice on the revision of the liquor sales license. The 
content is as follows: 1) The transfer of the business rights of 
a store under business closure is not permitted. 2) Even in a 
case where the business rights are being taken over from an 
established store that has gone out of business, the store floor 
space cannot be expanded by more than 100 square meters, and the 
overall space cannot exceed 3,000 square meters. 3) A store 
cannot move during its first year of business. 
  The new class of discount dealers has acquired liquor sales 
licenses through capital participation in established liquor 
stores. Inability to acquire the licenses of stores with closed 
business is a matter of survival for them. 
  Also, the discount dealers are making broad discounts 
possible through mass purchase and mass sales. They require mass 
warehousing for that purpose. If they are restricted to 3,000 
square meters including warehouses, business will actually be 
impossible. The tax agency's notice is merely a joint scheme 
between the liquor sales union and the wholesale liquor sales 
union--organizations of the established stores--to shut out the 
discounters. 
  In fact, the pressure applied by these groups on the bargain 
stores is beyond imagination. For example, Kawachiya Co. opened 
a bargain store in the town of Shirane in Yamanashi Prefecture. 
However, because the makers and wholesalers in Yamanashi 
Prefecture joined to deny deliveries to Kawachiya, it was forced 
to ship sake from Tokyo in order to continue business. President 
Yukio Higuchi maintains a bullish posture when he says: 
"Regardless of the pressure, we are doing good business," but 
the transportation costs are not negligible. 
  A person in charge of public relations at Daiei says: "Ever 
since it was reported that Nakauchi went to see Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, there has been a rush of reporters covering 
deregulation." The announcement that "it would be possible to 
lower prices if the various permits and licenses for the opening 
of superstores should be abolished" suddenly attracted attention. 
  According to Daiei, an immense amount of labor is spent on 
food-related permits in opening a store. In the case of 
superstores, meat, fish, ice cream, and delicacies are sold, and 
permits must be obtained from the health bureaus of the various 
prefectures for each store. Moreover, in the case of meat, it is 
not only sold but also simply cooked, and in addition to 
licenses for edible meat, licenses for restaurants are 
necessary. Therefore, applications for about 20 licenses must 
reportedly be submitted to the health authorities. With the need 
for so many licenses, the cost and time spent for renewals are 
enormous. 
  Also, according to the present Food Sanitation Law, every 
store must have a washroom. It is joked that the superstores are 
overequipped with washrooms. This also an "unnecessary cost" 
according to those concerned. 
  The fact that permits and licenses vary according to the 
region and the officials in charge is also a source of headaches 
for the superstores. Although it is said to be based on the Food 
Sanitation Law, the government agency is able to manipulate 
operations in the name of administrative guidance. It is also a 
large waste of time to cope with it. 
  If such a wide range of time, effort, and cost are roughly 
calculated in terms of overall cost, it would come to about 160 
million yen for Daiei. In order to meet this cost, about 7.5 
billion yen in sales is necessary, calculating in reverse from 
from Daiei's business profit rate. If the regulatory system is 
abolished, there would be room to lower prices by the cost 
amount. According to Daiei's estimates, it will result in a 
price drop of about 0.4 percent. Although all regulations are 
not unnecessary, it must be remembered that it is not only 
Daiei, but also the consumers who are forced to carry such cost 
burdens. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Customs as a Barrier </H5>
  Based on his experience in personally importing an American 
car from Australia, Richard Koo of THE ECONOMIST describes his 
anger toward the customs office as follows. "Bureaucrats say 
foolish things such as the market will be open if customs duties 
are abolished. However they do not notice that, amid the rampant 
regulations that harass us, Japan is isolating itself. It is 
such an ordeal to even import a single car. How can the 
promotion of imports be possible?" 
  Let us continue our discussion of Mister Koo. The customs 
duties for cars was zero, and only a consumption tax was 
charged. However, the customs-related costs equaled half of the 
transportation cost from Australia. 
  The greatest problem concerns the complicated documents that 
must be filed at the customs office and the land transportation 
bureau. First, explanations regarding the engine number and the 
chassis number are required. Unless everything can be explained, 
the documents will not be accepted. Inquiries were made of the 
dealer in Australia and the main office in the United States, 
and an explanation was somehow submitted based on conversations 
with the parties concerned in Japan, but the next hurdle was the 
petition for a garage certificate. At the police station near 
his residence, he was asked to show a certificate of his 
personal seal, which he was not required to submit. When he 
protested, the official in charge became defiant and told him: 
"That is why we are asking you." There is absolutely no basis 
for it, but the petition will not be accepted until he shows it. 
Long ago, when an airline company purchased an aircraft, it was 
required to submit a list of its stockholders. However, what 
relationship is there between a car purchase and a personal seal 
certificate? 
  Such "harassment" by import regulations has been experienced 
by numerous domestic importers. In addition to ordinary customs 
procedures, import procedures include nearly 30 other statutory 
permits and licenses. 
  For example, if one wishes to import grapefruits, two 
permits 
under the Plant Quarantine Law (MAFF) and the Food Sanitation 
Law (Ministry of Finance) must be acquired before submitting 
them to customs. The inspection station is distant and, 
depending on the ability of the inspector to respond, the 
inspection takes about two days. There is also a check on 
whether drugs are present, and the inspections are conducted 
separately. 
  Simplification of the inspections and procedures have been 
implemented in many forms. However, it is confined to the 
procedural text, and the burden of the importers remains 
virtually unchanged. For example, a method has been introduced 
whereby the respective inspectors will conduct the inspections 
simultaneously, but virtually no importer has requested it. The 
actual inspections are left to the discretion of the inspector 
on duty. For example, the inspection based on the Food 
Sanitation Law is not necessarily done. If one requests an 
inspection that might not be conducted, it will mean additional 
time and cost (the inspection cost is paid by the importer). In 
the case of a request for consecutive imports of the same 
product, inspection is omitted under the previous analysis 
certificate for period of six months. However, when the 
effective period is up, it will take time to wait in turn for 
inspection. Therefore, the importer generally conducts voluntary 
inspection at his own expense. Deregulation has not taken effect 
at all at the lower reaches. 
  The rigidity of the import procedures has virtually not 
improved. When importing beef, mistaking the quantity and 
discrepancy between the number of parts (of the animal) and 
those listed in the certificate of the exporting country is 
almost a daily occurrence. However, inspection reportedly cannot 
be passed unless the discrepant portion is thrown out or a new 
certificate is acquired. Moreover, it is a problem because only 
the original certificate is accepted. In effect, in general, a 
separate request reportedly can be submitted to the authorities 
for a free pass. If so, why is an inspection needed in the first 
place? 
  Because lawn turf is imported in the form of seeds, a 
palette 
inspection of the seeds is conducted. Even if a single seed of 
another plant is found, the turf must be destroyed because will 
be "injurious to Japan's ecosystem." 
  Such regulations are not only drawbacks of the rigidity of 
vertical administration, but they are also a reflection of the 
excessive spread of the protection tendency. Of course, there 
are such commodities as food products that require safety checks 
at the water's edge, but there is undeniably an aspect of 
excessive regulation that increases import costs and delays 
Japan's structural change. A certain major importer says, "The 
customs office still is a checkpoint where one must beg to be 
allowed passage." There is a great need for improvement.

<F P=106> [Article by Eiichi Takahashi] </F>
  [Text] Deregulation without substance will not stand up. 
Regardless of the changes in the text, that alone does not 
represent a change. The bureaucrats are good at that. This is 
what Chairman Masao Ogura of the Yamato Transport Co. points 
out. It is apropos. 
  With the enactment of the aforementioned two laws on goods 
distribution, the transport charges in the land transportation 
industry were "deregulated" from the permit system to the 
notification system, but the substance has not changed at all. 
In the general language sense, it is normally considered that a 
report is complete if a cost account statement is attached and 
the intended date of implementation is indicated, based on the 
rules of the government agency. However, the language sense of 
the bureaucrat is different. Simply stated, the dealer submits 
the documents, the official checks them and, if everything seems 
to be in order, he stamps them as accepted. The notification is 
completed only if the stamp of acceptance is applied. This 
appears to be the language sense of the bureaucrat. In that 
sense, there is substantially no difference whether a permit 
becomes a license, or a license becomes a notification. 
<H5>  Hidden Essence of Regulations </H5>
  Moreover, the problem was that the standard for the 
official's judgment of approval was not clear. As is well known, 
costs differ widely, depending on the business category, scale 
and management efforts of the respective enterprises. Regardless 
of how capable the Japanese bureaucrat, it is almost impossible 
for him to accurately grasp the cost structure of an individual 
company based on a sheet of document. Nonetheless, he concludes 
that it is either okay or not okay. From the standpoint of the 
individual company, it is natural to be dissatisfied, and it 
feels an urgent need to "become better acquainted" with the 
bureaucrat. It also results in further distrust of government 
agencies. 
  What is worse is that, despite submitting documents, it does 
not know when it will receive a reply. When the Yamato Transport 
Co. acquired two route permits, the Transportation Ministry 
reviewed the request documents only after it became the object 
of administrative litigation. Also, the most insidious is the 
so-called administrative guidance. There is no legal basis for 
administrative guidance, and guidance is often offered verbally. 
The issuance of documents is skirted to avoid leaving evidence. 
During the oil black market cartel incident, and also during the 
recent securities scandal, the government gave its implicit 
approval and guidance, but when the incidents were exposed, it 
persisted in professing its "innocence." 
  Also, among the established dealers were seen moves as an 
industry group to deter new entries, approach the agencies to 
protect their vested interests, and to rely on administrative 
guidance. An aspect of connivance between the bureaucracy and 
the industry from the standpoint of the "established order" 
cannot be denied. 
<H5>  Transparency of Administration Is Urgently Needed </H5>
  Among the advanced nations of the West, most have 
established 
administrative procedural laws and freedom of information laws 
to prevent such evil practices. In Japan also, there is a rising 
demand in recent years to enact a similar administrative 
procedures law. In 1979, the "council on preventive measures 
concerning suspected aircraft scandals," which was created in 
reaction to the Lockheed incident, proposed strengthening the 
General Administrative Procedures Law. The crime by a prime 
minister resulted in self-reflection on unclear administration 
as the breeding ground for a cozy alliance between the 
government, bureaucracy, and industrial circles. 
  The movement toward legislation picked up momentum after the 
Second Administrative Reform Council's proposal in 1983 on "the 
establishment of an ad hoc specialized investigation and 
deliberation organization" for the enactment of an 
administrative procedures act, and after the followup Third 
Administraive Reform Council submitted to the prime minister in 
December 1991 "a report on the drafting of a fair and clear 
administrative procedures law." 
  In May 1993, the Miyazawa cabinet made a decision on 
submission of an administrative procedures act to the Diet. On 4 
June, the gist was explained at the lower house plenary session. 
However, as is well known, it met a doomed fate amid the passage 
of a no-confidence vote in the cabinet and a tendency toward 
dissolution of the lower house. The administrative procedures 
law bill to be submitted to the Diet consists of the same 
content, in principle, as the previous proposal. 
  Its characteristics are generally as follows. First, the 
purpose of the law is to ensure fairness in administrative 
actions and to improve clarity. Simply stated, the purpose is to 
form clear rules regarding regulations and administrative 
guidance, which had been left chiefly up to the convenient 
interpretation of the government agencies. 
  Specifically, they consist of three pillars. First, to 
ensure 
swift and clear processing. Toward that end, 1) to publicly 
announce concrete judgments concerning permits and licenses; 2) 
to decide and publicly announce standard inspection periods from 
petition to disposition; 3) to begin inspections without delay 
on reception of petitions, and to avoid neglect of petitioned 
proposals and delays in processing; 4) when rejecting a 
petition, to indicate the reasons by letter. 
  The second pillar involves procedures on so-called nonprofit 
disposition, including cancellation of permits and business 
suspensions. In principle, 1) the reasons for disposition are to 
be indicated with documentation; 2) perusal of proof materials 
used as the basis are to be permitted; and 3) opportunities for 
pleas are to guaranteed. These are all matters of course 
regarding disposition, but the fact that they failed to be 
implemented is characteristic of Japan's administration. 
  The third pillar concerns administrative guidance. It has 
been decided that: 1) The jurisdictional scope will not be 
exceeded. 2) Administrative guidance is an action premised on 
voluntary cooperation by the petitioner, and unprofitable 
treatment based on lack of obedience will be prohibited. 3) 
Administrative guidance with permits/licenses as the backdrop 
will be banned. 4) In addition to providing documents on 
request, the spirit, content, and responsible official will be 
clarified. 
  Because both the ruling and opposition parties have no 
reservations as far as the Administrative Procedures Law is 
concerned, "the era of `nemawashi' [spadework] has ended" 
(Managenent and Coordination Agency). Therefore, although an 
indeterminate element concerning the conclusion of the political 
reform act bill does exist, the probability of enactment may be 
considered to be good. 
  Of course, as was mentioned before, the behavior of the 
government agencies will not necessarily change instantly after 
enactment of the bill. There is an aspect of politics and the 
industry circles coexisting in cozy comfort amid the permits and 
licenses, and a change of the established order is more 
difficult than the formulation of resolutions. The principal 
corporations licensed by MITI are listed as follows:

    For example, there are six licensed corporations in the LP 
gas-related field alone. Like the oil and black market cartel 
problems, if administrative guidance shifts by using the 
licensed corporations under the name of the industry's 
independent (voluntary) rules, the unclarity will only increase. 
Even if it does not, there will be criticism that administrative 
guidance, which previously had no legal basis, is given a "legal 
basis" within the scope of jurisdictional affairs by this law. 
  However, despite considering the apprehensions and 
criticisms, enactment of the Administrative Procedures Law 
represents a major step forward. In effect, it is probably a 
question of implementation. The answer is the self-discipline 
and awareness of the industrial circles and the individual 
citizen.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article; part 28 in the series "The Coalition </F>
-- A Revolving Stage": "Strange Phenomena in Nagata-cho at 
Year-End; Dietmen Uneasy, Caught by the Wind of the Diet 
Dissolving"] 
  [Text] With the formulation of the 1994 budget having been 
passed over into next year, Nagata-cho [town where the Diet is 
located, thus referring to the Diet itself] at a year-end like 
this year's would normally be bustling with people from the 
dietmen's constituencies arriving at their offices to make all 
kinds of petitions and requests. But this year, Nagata-cho is 
strangely calm, and the dietmen are uneasy. 
  Deliberations on political reform bills in the House of 
Councillors are not making progress, and the dietmen hear 
leaders of both ruling and opposition camps making unsettling 
comments like "the lower house should be dissolved and a general 
election conducted" if the bills fail to get passed. 
  On 17 December, Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and Wataru Kubo, general 
secretary of the party, met at party headquarters. 
<H5>  Party Leaders With Aching Heads </H5>
  One said: "With things in this state, there is no other 
choice but to dissolve the Diet and hold a general election." 
The other agreed, "Maybe we should start getting ready for it." 
  But they need funds to prepare for a general election, and 
the party's vault is empty. One senior party secretariat 
official said: "We need at least 1.2 billion yen in election 
funds just for the party headquarters." The party raised only a 
little over 1 billion yen for the last general election held in 
July -- 600 million donated by supporting trade unions and the 
balance borrowed from banks. The party is not sure when it can 
pay back the outstanding bank debts. 
  The senior secretariat official said in anguish: "How can we 
raise the needed money?" The secretariat first thought about 
providing 1 million yen to each current lower house member in 
the year-end operational funds. But they were unable to come up 
with the 76 million yen necessary for that, and had to give up 
the idea. 
  Things have not been going well with the SDPJ recently, 
anyway. Some within the party think the party should avoid the 
situation of dissolving the Diet if possible. They say if the 
party starts preparing for an election, it could give an 
impression to other parties that the election is forthcoming, 
thus causing alarm. Their thinking is that there is no reason 
why the money-short SDPJ should act rashly. 
  Within the coalition camp, even Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] has not provided year-end "gift expenses" to its members. 
The ostensible reason for this is that the party has no money, 
but one senior party member admitted: "If they go back home and 
run around using the money, it can put fire in the mood for Diet 
dissolution." 
<H5>  Local Constituencies Are Not in the Mood </H5>
  The fact is that local districts are not in the mood for 
another general election yet. A senior Shinseito member said: 
"If I go back to my district and suggest an election, all I 
hear is `what do you intend to do about economic stimulus 
measures?'" A Komeito official said: "The supporters' mood is 
that we had an election only half a year ago; do not even talk 
about another election." 
  Speaking at a gathering held in commemoration of the late 
Dietman Shigeru Hori on the evening of 20 December, Shunpei 
Tsukahara, who is in charge of finance at the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP], said: "I was afraid of how much political 
donations I would be able to raise from corporations. But the 
funds for the latter half of this year have come in. In 
addition, the banks have agreed to extend our debt payment. If 
the election is to come, we have ample money. Please rest 
assured of that." 
  In September following the changing of hands in government, 
the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan [Keidanren] 
decided it should stop recommending its member corporations 
donating to political parties. And at the time of the July 
general election, the LDP had to borrow about 14.5 billion yen. 
With the current economic woes coming on top of that, the LDP's 
treasury should be hard-put as well. 
<H5>  LDP Forwards Money Through Banks </H5>
  Anyway, insisting that the lower house can be dissolved any 
day, the party financial division got banks to accept extension 
of its payment of 4.5 billion yen due this year. The party's 
calculation is that "if it has about 10 billion at its disposal, 
it will be able to manage the next election somehow. Tsukara's 
remarks about "resting assured" probably meant that the party 
would be able to cope with a financial pinch that comes at the 
end of a year. 
  On the following day -- 21 December -- the LDP gave out 
the traditional year-end "gift expenses" of 3 million yen each 
to about 210 upper and lower house members of the grade who have 
not been named to cabinet posts yet. But now being a time when 
political reform is so widely talked about, the party leadership 
agonized over whether it should distribute the money until the 
last moment. With speculations on the Diet's dissolution rising 
and with the party Diet members calling for funds, the party 
eventually decided to give out the money as it has done in the 
past. However, the amount given out this year was smaller than 
in previous years and it was forwarded through banks where money 
flow can be said to be highly transparent. Apparently, the 
party was concerned about how the public will see it. 
  Now, there is the question of whether or not the lower house 
will be dissolved. No doubt, the deliberations on the political 
reform bills in January foretell a danger comparable to trying 
to foretell who will win in a duel of warriors. There are not 
enough days for the bills to be acted on, while the gap between 
the ruling and opposition camps is not narrowing. The coalition 
parties often fall into disarray. There is no denying that the 
situation is grave, and that if the bills do not get passed, 
political responsibility will be asked in the form of the 
cabinet resigning or the Diet dissolving. 
  Shinseito General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa, who is a pillar of 
the ruling coalition, declared on 20 December that he was going 
into a "rest" and has not showed up since in any official 
meeting. Among the ruling coalition, there are many 
speculations about this, and one Social Democratic Party 
official asked, "Could he be doing something about a showdown in 
January?" 
  The LDP is poised to be tough. Party General Secretary 
Yoshiro Mori declared: "An opposition party must be able to 
respond to the call for Diet dissolution at all times." But a 
senior member of the party's Obuchi faction admitted: "All that 
we can say is we will respond. We now have less power to 
initiate Diet dissolution from our side." With so many general 
contractor-involved scandals being brought into the open 
recently, one official said: "We are not too confident about 
winning in an election." 
  On 21 December, a plenary session of the party Tax Research
