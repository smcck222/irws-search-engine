  [Text] Former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe, head 
of the Watanabe faction in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], 
criticizes the ruling coalition more severely than any other LDP 
faction leader. Concerning the high approval rating for the 
Hosokawa cabinet, Watanabe grumbled: "It is no use saying 
anything about it now." He levels caustic criticism at the 
cabinet's failure to launch an effective pump-priming package. 
In particular, Watanabe is critical of the government's 
decision to postpone the compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget 
until next year. Some officials close to Watanabe have begun to 
say: "He may be aiming at the downfall of the cabinet." 
  Just before the government-proposed political reform bills 
passed the House of Representatives on 18 November, Watanabe 
eagerly told LDP members: "If the LDP maintains its unity, it 
will not necessarily be defeated in the elections. It is 
impossible for the ruling coalition, which is composed of seven 
political parties and a parliamentary group, to field unified 
candidates." By making this remark, he tried to ease a sense of 
crisis within the LDP that, "if a single-seat constituency 
system combined with proportional representation is introduced, 
the LDP will be further divided." 
  However, immediately after it became clear that it was 
impossible to enact the political reform bills before the end of 
the year, Watanabe began to say: "Real political reform lies in 
the prevention of corruption." Recently, he severely criticized 
a decision on extension of the current Diet session, saying: "If 
the Diet fails both to promote deliberations on the reform bills 
and to compile the fiscal 1994 budget within the year, we may as 
well call for the dissolution of the Diet." His remark 
indicates he is ready to face a general election following the 
dissolution of the lower house. 
  By continuously passing severe criticism on the ruling 
coalition, Watanabe aims to maintain the unity of the LDP and 
"seek ways to form a new LDP-led coalition" (according to a 
Watanabe aide). Some LDP members claim: "LDP President Yohei 
Kono cannot contend with the ruling coalition because he takes 
the same political stance as Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa." 
They "expect Watanabe, a good contender, to become LDP 
president." It seems that encouraged by their expectations, 
Watanabe is promoting his own strategy for attaining political 
power. 
  The "research commission on security in Asia" is now in full 
swing. Taku Yamasaki, former director general of the Defense 
Agency and a senior Watanabe faction member, serves as chief 
secretary of the commission. Many people think the commission's 
full-swing activities are aimed at strengthening the LDP's 
centripetal force and maintaining party unity. 
  Nonetheless, three out of four LDP members who voted for an 
extension of the current Diet session and left the LDP were 
Watanabe faction members. This fact suggests that Watanabe's 
own centripetal force has weakened. Other LDP factions are 
turning their cool eyes on the Watanabe faction, thinking "more 
members will leave." It is likely that for the time being, 
Watanabe will have difficulty deciding on how he should act.

  [Text] On 23 December, the JIJI PRESS compiled the results 
of its monthly poll for December. According to the poll, the 
approval rating for the Hosokawa cabinet dropped dramatically to 
55.6 percent, a 10.5-percentage change from the previous month, 
while its disapproval rating has jumped to 23.4 percent, up from 
13.3 percent in November. The results show that some of those 
who supported the cabinet in November now disapprove of it. 
This is the first time the Hosokawa cabinet, which has 
maintained a high, 60 percent or more approval rating since its 
inauguration in August, has seen the rate drop below 60 percent. 
JIJI PRESS also surveyed approval ratings for political 
parties. While the support rate for the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] has increased a little, those for most of the ruling 
parties have dropped. 
  The nationwide poll was conducted on 12 and 13 December 
among 
2,000 men and women aged 20 or over. Of them, 70.1 percent 
agreed to be interviewed. 
  The large drop in the cabinet approval rating seems to be 
the 
result of its failure to launch an effective pump-priming 
package as well as its decision to partially open Japan's rice 
market. It is possible that a question about a loan provided by 
the Sagawa Kyubin parcel delivery company to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa also affected the rating. 
  When asked why they supported the cabinet, 18.1 percent of 
respondents noted its "favorable impression," 15.5 percent said, 
"the prime minister is trustworthy," and 15.3 percent said, 
"there is no one better than Hosokawa to do the job of prime 
minister." 
  Asked why they did not support the cabinet, 9.6 percent 
said, 
"the cabinet is incapable of meeting public expectations," and 5 
percent mentioned "its poor policies." The figures are almost 
double those of November. 
  Meanwhile, the poll shows that the LDP approval rating has 
increased a little to 23 percent from 22.2 percent in November, 
while support for most of the ruling parties has decreased. 
  The approval rating for the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
has dropped from 7.4 percent to 6.6 percent; for Shinseito from 
3.5 percent to 3.0 percent; for Komeito from 3.7 percent to 3.1 
percent; for the Japan New Party from 7 percent to 6.2 percent; 
and for the Democratic Socialist Party from 1.4 percent to 1 
percent. Sakigake and the United Socialist Democratic Party are 
the only parties among the ruling coalition whose support rates 
have increased from 1 percent to 1.3 percent and from 0.1 
percent to 0.2 percent, respectively. The approval rating for 
the Japan Communist Party dropped to 1.9 percent from 2.2 
percent in November.

<F P=106> [Article by Akihiko Magoori and Hiroki Fukuda of AERA's </F>
editorial department: "Truth and Falsehood of `Rumored Political 
Change at the End of January'"] 
  [Text] On 16 December, three House of Representatives 
members quit the LDP in defiance of their party's policy 
regarding extending the current extraordinary Diet; on that same 
day, former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka died. 
  The death of the former prime minister, who almost 
personified the LDP's best days, seems to symbolize the LDP's 
decline and the current transitional stage. 
  Shigeru Ishiba, who was present at the plenary session on 15 
December to vote for extending the Diet session in defiance of 
the LDP decision, said: "I decided to leave the party because I 
thought I would have to be responsible for bringing about 
political reform." Masamitsu Oishi revealed his inner thoughts 
at a news conference this way: "I had never imagined until 
yesterday that what happened today could actually take place." 
Takashi Sasagawa said: "I have a very pleasant feeling." 
  It is said that phone calls of encouragement from supporters 
poured in to the office of former LDP General Council Chairman 
Takeo Nishioka, who took action similar to that of the 
aforementioned trio and quit the party on 17 December. 
  The foursome are considering forming a new group with 
independent members of the House of Representatives who 
previously leapt out of the LDP. 
  Even Noriaki Watase, who was absent from the plenary session 
as directed by the party, resolutely said: "Political 
realignment is at the threshold, and there will be plenty of 
chances to put my life on the line." 
  A certain businessman was reported to have personally 
censured LDP President Yohei Kono face to face regarding its 
harassing tactics against the Hosokawa cabinet on the rice 
problem, asking: "What has become of the LDP?" 
  Is the predicament not the same as that of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which repeatedly resorted to 
such tactics as boycotting deliberations and ox-walks during its 
days as an opposition party? Where has the determination of the 
LDP, which had professed that it would become a responsible 
opposition party, gone? That sort of sense of despair is 
spreading in economic circles. 
<H5>  Liabilities From the Days of LDP-Controlled Government </H5>
  "Mr. Hosokawa is an amateur, and it is about time for him to 
give up." "The time has come for professionals to work out 
emergency economic measures. The LDP has to go out to take 
charge." These are the recent words of former Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro Nakasone. 
  Political reform, rice problems, and sluggish business 
conditions are liabilities left over from the days of the 
LDP-led governments. The majority of people are undoubtedly 
aware of this fact, and say that such posturing is too indulgent 
on the part of the LDP. 
  For the time being, the LDP is determined to refuse to 
respond to deliberations on political reform bills at the House 
of Councillors, in opposition to the extension of the Diet 
session. Should such a situation continue, however, there is a 
strong possibility that the public desertion from the LDP will 
accelerate. 
  Not only will the LDP face a predicament, but cracks in the 
SDPJ position will further widen. 
  SDPJ Diet members opposing electoral reform, a crucial 
element of political reform, were conspicuous in demanding their 
party's secession from the coalition regime by adamantly 
opposing opening markets when problems concerning the rice issue 
arose. 
  They seemed to have intended to kill the political reform 
bills by using the rice problem as leverage. 
  Against this background, reform-minded young Diet members 
were reported to have seriously debated leaving the SDPJ if it 
ever broke away from the coalition. 
  One such young Diet member said: "Because of the 
complications involving rice, it became clear to me that I can 
no longer stay with the SDPJ. If a chance ever arises, I will 
leave the party." 
  About the party convention the SDPJ is to hold on 11 and 12 
January, a rumor similar to the following has been circulating: 
"At the convention, Chairman Tomiichi Murayama will retire, and 
for that position, Hokkaido Governor Takahiro Yokomichi is 
expected to be recommended." 
  It seems most unlikely that Mr. Yokoyama will want to go 
along with the proposal, since he is said to be attempting to 
organize a new political party. Such a rumor reflects the fact 
that Murayama and his executives have lost their unifying force. 
<H5>  Recovery of Reliance Sought by Materializing Reform </H5>
  By deciding to extend its session for 45 days until 29 
January, calm temporarily returned to the Diet, where the matter 
of opening markets to rice imports and whether or not to extend 
the session were simultaneously discussed. 
  With the extension of the Diet session, the LDP and the SDPJ 
both survived fears that they would disintegrate during the past 
year. But this amounts to nothing more than putting off finding 
solutions to problems to a later day. Cracks spreading in the 
positions of both parties are likely to bring about splitting 
the parties in connection with whether or not to adopt political 
reform bills to be voted on at the end of January. 
  Komeito's Secretary-General Yuichi Ichikawa said: "After 
many twists and turns, the bills will be passed after all." 
  Against the LDP's heightened insistence on emphasizing 
measures to deal with business conditions, Shinseito's chief 
secretary Ichiro Ozawa noted that he thinks early realization of 
political reform is indispensable to overcoming recession, 
saying: "It is like putting the cart before the horse to say the 
recession problem must be settled prior to political reform." 
  At an "emergency general meeting with both coalition and 
opposition Diet members" held on 14 December by a private ad hoc 
commission on administrative reform, a young Diet member said: 
"As a precondition for implementing policies that will be 
accompanied by sufferings of the people, it is necessary to gain 
popular support. For that purpose, the materialization of 
political reform is a duty of Diet members." 
  On 16 December, the day after the decision to extend the 
Diet 
session was reached, the average stock price of the First 
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose from the previous day 
by 300 yen. This seems to indicate market expectation of 
political stability. 
  There is no guarantee, however, of a smooth deliberation at 
the House of Councillors, which is said "to maintain intact the 
1955 order." Different from the House of Representatives, the 
upper house is controlled by both the LDP and the SDPJ, and 
quite a few SDPJ members oppose the bills currently being 
proposed. 
<H5>  Frontal Breakthrough Eyed in Accordance With Article 59 </H5>
  Close associates of Mr. Ozawa said: "All means imaginable 
are 
being prepared to cope with all kinds of situations in the upper 
house." One is a frontal breakthrough, in accordance with 
Article 59 of the Constitution, which says that a failure of the 
House of Councillors to take final action within sixty days 
after receipt of a bill passed by the House of Representatives 
"may be determined by the House of Representatives to constitute 
a rejection of the said bill by the House of Councillors." 
  In that case, the bill can become law by passing it a second 
time in the lower house by a two-thirds majority or more of the 
members present or by calling for a joint committee meeting 
comprising both Houses. 
  Although it is difficult to obtain a two-thirds majority in 
the lower house, the possibility of a bill being passed will be 
high if the bill is referred to a joint committee of both 
Houses, because it can then become law by obtaining a simple 
majority of both Houses. 
  Since the political reform bills passed through the lower 
house on 18 November, the 60th day falls on 16 January. On and 
after the next day, 17 January, such "surprise moves" can be 
used. 
  The magic of this move is to refer the bill to the lower 
house for a second deliberation. It is based on the calculation 
that once the bill is returned to the lower house, the House can 
be easily dissolved when the bill is threatened to be shelved, 
although it is difficult to dissolve the lower house on grounds 
that the upper house is delaying the deliberation. 
  But actions relying on Article 59 may invite criticism that 
"the House of Councillors are robbed of the right to deliberate 
on bills, thus neglecting the upper house." In the postwar 
history of the Diet, only one precedent can be found, in 1952, 
when the wage bill for Maritime Safety Agency employees was 
passed by a joint committee of both Houses. 
  The coalition ruling parties are considering these plans 
because they want to expedite upper house deliberations by 
threatening that they may take such firm actions. 
  Simultaneous secret maneuvers to undermine the solidarity of 
the upper house LDP members are underway. Those close to Mr. 
Ozawa are confident that "the LDP members of the House of 
Councillors will incline toward the ruling parties if the 
Hosokawa regime maintains high support ratings and increases its 
stability, because many of the LDP members are former 
bureaucrats." 
  Former Minister of Labor Masakuni Murakami, a LDP member of 
the House of Councillors, pointed out that the upper house 
deliberation may be difficult for the time being because the 
Diet session was extended high-handedly. He added: "It must not 
maintain inertial continuation of the 1955 order." "Since the 
upper house is intended to control as well as compliment the 
lower one, ways may be found to amend the bills." 
  As for amendments, it is suggested that the distribution of 
seats in both single-member election districts and proportional 
representation districts be reviewed and that proportional 
districts from the national district be changed to several 
blocks. 
<H5>  Problems Converge Again at the End of January </H5>
  The Hosokawa regime plans to launch measures to boost 
economic conditions by large-scale tax cuts and the third 
supplementary budget bill, simultaneously expediting 
deliberation of the bills. 
  On the other hand, it embraces the problem of raising 
consumption tax rates as possible sources of revenue to fill the 
gap created by tax cuts. 
  The SDPJ strongly opposes the consumption tax raise. 
Therefore, it intends to put off the formation of next year's 
budget bill until next year in order not to be entangled with 
deliberations on political reform. 
  "The Hosokawa regime is on the brink of falling, without 
chance of recovery, because it is obsessed with three 
falsehoods." The LDP's former Minister of Posts and 
Telecommunications Junichiro Koizumi points out that the present 
regime will reach an impasse after all because of the three 
difficulties: the partial opening of the market to rice imports; 
failure to legislate political reform bills before the year end; 
and the 100 million-yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin to the prime 
minister himself. 
  The LDP currently clings to a hope of regaining power, which 
remains nothing more than a wish. 
  However, Prime Minister Hosokawa cannot evade taking 
responsibility if the bills fail to pass, because the Diet 
session was extended on grounds of materializing political 
reform. 
  It is unmistakably clear that the political situation will 
become tense in late January, when a number of problems converge 
at a time when deliberation of the bills reaches a climax.

  [Text] During a YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview on 27 December, 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Tsutomu Hata, who is 
deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister, 
speaking on the outlook for deliberations on the political 
reform bills said: "Since the electoral system is an issue 
regarding rules in a democracy, meetings should be held (between 
ruling and opposition parties) to mutually discuss ways to reach 
a compromise." He thus reiterated the need for ruling and 
opposition parties to reach a compromise for the passage of the 
political reform bills. 
  Concerning the view expressed by some politicians that the 
lower house of the Diet should be dissolved if the political 
reform bills fail to become law during the current Diet session, 
Hata said: "We should be ready and willing to do just that." 
However, he also said: "Dissolving the Diet is not such a 
simple matter."

  [Text] In a news conference held on 27 December, Komeito 
Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa expressed a negative attitude 
toward further concessions on the political reform bills. 
Commenting on recent remarks by Deputy Prime Minister and 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who has showed a flexible stance 
toward major revisions of the political reform bills, Ichikawa 
said: "Different approaches could be possible if the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] is ready to accept our concessions 
without boycotting Diet deliberations. Under the present 
circumstance, it is difficult for coalition parties to allow 
further concessions on the main points of the bills." 
  It is believed that Ichikawa's remarks were made in view of 
opinions among Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] members. 
The quota for single-seat constituencies was already increased 
from 250 to 274 when the bills passed the lower house, and the 
SDPJ would certainly oppose a further increase. 
  As an example of concessions, Hata proposed dividing a 
nationwide constituency for the proportional representative 
election into several regional blocs; however, Ichikawa noted: 
"Not only the LDP, but also each party in the coalition would 
have various opinions on the design of the regional constituency 
blocs. If we set our hands on this issue, it would take at 
least 40 days to reach an accord. I do not think it is a 
realistic idea."

  [Text] On an NHK program recorded on 29 December, Tomiichi 
Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ], and Tsutomu Hata, leader of Shinseito (and deputy prime 
minister and foreign minister), revealed their views on how to 
deal with the current political situation. Discussing the issue 
of further revising political reform bills in the House of 
Councillors, Murayama showed a positive stance on a recent 
proposal, saying: "The proposal that proportional representation 
seats should be decided on a prefectural basis is worth 
studying." However, he took an uncompromising attitude on ways 
to reallocate seats for single-seat constituencies and 
proportional representation and to handle political donations by 
companies and other organizations. He stressed: "If we adopt 
loose rules on them, it will decrease the significance of 
efforts to prevent political corruption and to achieve political 
reform. We should leave these key points untouched." He added: 
"If there is a portion on which political parties cannot reach 
an agreement, a vote should be taken. That is the only 
alternative." 
  Concerning the possibility of the dissolution of the House 
of 
Representatives for the general election following a failure to 
enact the political reform bills in the extended Diet session, 
Hata said: "It may be good for political parties to contend in 
the election for their policies." But he was negative about 
dissolving the house, saying: "It is not time to dissolve the 
lower house since there are many issues to be tackled." As for 
the issue concerning whether Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
should take political responsibility if he fails to have the 
political reform bills adopted, Hata said: "The prime minister 
is making sincere efforts for the reform. And yet, can you hold 
him responsible for failing to achieve reform? The public will 
ask each Diet member to take responsibility." 
  Meanwhile, Murayama said: "If the bills are scrapped, the 
cabinet will be held responsible for it. We should make as much 
effort as possible to avoid the dissolution of the House. But 
if the bills should be scrapped, it is possible the government 
will ask people's judgment on the bills." While stressing that 
the SDPJ would work for the passage of all four political reform 
bills, Murayama said: "If the bills are scrapped, the Diet 
itself will be held responsible for the failure of political 
reform. It may as well try to at least pass the bill on the 
prevention of political corruption to live up to the people's 
expectations. This is one option." In this way, Murayama 
indicated that if it were impossible to enact all four bills, it 
might be necessary to separate the bill on the prevention of 
corruption from the others to have it enacted.

  [Text] On an NHK program recorded on 29 December, Yohei 
Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], discussed 
pump-priming measures to overcome the current recession. He 
said: "I think it is necessary to implement income tax cuts 
worth about 10 trillion yen." He then said he would approve of 
the government issuing deficit-covering bonds to finance the 
cuts. Kono is the first LDP leader to approve the issuing of 
deficit-financing bonds. It is likely that his opinion will 
affect tax reform arguments within the government and the ruling 
coalition. Concerning political reform bills, he stressed that 
they should be enacted during the current Diet session and 
called on the ruling coalition to make concessions in electoral 
reform to agree to the LDP plan that in a single-seat 
constituency system combined with proportional representation, 
proportional representation seats should be decided on a 
prefectural basis. 
  Kono severely criticized the Hosokawa government's economic 
policy, saying: "Politicians should make difficult decisions. 
It is more important than anything else. It is no good that 
they just listen to what financial authorities are saying." He 
indicated a negative view on raising the consumption tax rate, a 
measure considered to fund the income tax cuts. He said: "The 
increase in consumption tax will adversely effect the economy." 
  He said the LDP would watch carefully what kind of economic 
policies and economy-boosting measures the government would 
formulate, and would cooperate with the government if it could 
launch a positive pump-priming package. 
  Kono also said if the government and the ruling coalition 
decide to dissolve the House of Representatives following their 
failure to enact the political reform bills during the current 
Diet session, "we have no choice but to accept the decision." 
In this way, he stressed that the LDP was not afraid of the 
dissolution of the House.

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] plans to include 
revenues from sales of government-held shares in Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) in a draft budget for 
fiscal 1994. It is considering selling 500,000 shares. There is 
criticism that "the MOF places priority on selling NTT shares 
held by the government." However, the MOF appears to think this 
criticism will weaken because a ban on selling NTT shares is to 
be lifted at the end of fiscal 1993 and because it included the 
resumption of public capital increase in measures to deregulate 
the stock market, which the ministry recently announced. It 
will decide whether or not to sell the shares while carefully 
watching the trend of the stock market. If the MOF sells the 
shares, it will be the first time it has done so in six years. 
  The ministry will put the revenues from the sales in the 
debt 
consolidation fund. Although the fund is for repaying national 
debts, part of it will be used for public works projects. The 
ministry plans to estimate the revenue amount by examining NTT 
share prices in the market. If the share price keeps to the 
level of the closing price at the Tokyo Stock Exchange on 22 
December (which was 751,000 yen), the profit will be about 300 
billion yen after a selling charge is deducted. 
  The MOF hopes to spend part of the revenue on public works 
projects to shore up the economy. 
  Nonetheless, it thinks that the stock market is in a severe 
situation. That is why it dropped plans last weekend to list 
Japan Tobacco Inc. shares on the stock market in the current 
fiscal year. Thus, it is still uncertain if the MOF will 
actually sell NTT shares. 
  After giving up selling NTT shares in fiscal 1989, the 
government planned to sell 500,000 shares each year over a 
five-year period starting in fiscal 1991. However, because the 
stock market continued to be sluggish, it hesitated to sell the 
shares. In August 1992, the government announced the freeze on 
the sales of NTT shares in fiscal 1992 and 1993.

<H5>  Cabinet Support Rate Remains High </H5>
  The Hosokawa cabinet still maintains a high level of public 
support four months after its inauguration. Under the LDP 
ruling, the cabinet support rate moved in parallel with the LDP 
support rate. However, under the Hosokawa administration, the 
popularity of the JNP and the coalition parties is in decline 
while the administration itself receives broad support. In 
other words, high public support for the cabinet is due to 
Hosokawa's personal popularity. 
  The LDP support rate remains at 22 percent, or the lowest 
level since the beginning of the survey. Only farmers, 
fishermen, and those over 60 years in age offered support of 
over 30 percent. Support for LDP President Yohei Kono is also 
dropping.

  [Text]Changes in Livelihood 
  After the inauguration of the Hosokawa administration, a 
larger proportion of the public feel more satisfied about 
politics; however, changes in people's livelihood are not 
favorable. During the period from January 1991 to September 
1993, people did not feel the influence of the recession. 
However, since October a greater number of pollees began to 
answer that their living conditions were "becoming worse." If 
things are left as they are, the Hosokawa administration may 
lose its popularity. This reminds me of former U.S. President 
George Bush's failure to win reelection. He had the support of 
90 percent of the public immediately after the Gulf war, but the 
support rate dropped quickly due to the recession.

<H5>  Political Reform and the Hosokawa Cabinet's Responsibility </H5>
  During a news conference immediately after his inauguration, 
Prime Minister Hosokawa said: "I will take responsibility if I 
fail to enact the political reform bills during the ongoing Diet 
session." But the voters are not strict about Hosokawa's 
responsibility for the political reform issue. In our survey, 
only 21 percent said "the cabinet should resign en masse to take 
responsibility." On the other hand, 26 percent said "the 
cabinet should dissolve the lower house, and 38 percent said 
"neither the cabinet's resignation nor the lower house's 
dissolution is needed."

position, beating the SDPJ. Until January 1992, more than 50 
percent of the voters said they would vote for the LDP, but the 
rate declined by half. 
NOTE: The survey, conducted by Chuo Research Inc. on 11-14 
November, was carried on as individual interviews of 2,000 
eligible voters picked at random. Responses were obtained from

<F P=106> [Article by Auto News Coverage Group] </F>
  [Text] Japan's automakers who had prided themselves on 
being invincible only a year and a half ago are now facing the 
consequences of their excessive investments during the bubble 
economy. Amid the effects of the sharp rise of the yen, the 
future is uncertain for the companies that are steadily lowering 
costs aand restricting the number of personnel. 
<H3>  Toyota: Personnel Reshuffle of 20 Percent in the Indirect 
Sector; Faced With Measures Concerning Surplus Plants </H3>
  Toyota Motor Corp., which was a synonym for the 
high-earnings 
enterprise, has been doubly impacted by the recession and the 
high yen. The company's June 1993 settlement shows a business 
profit of 103.629 billion yen, which is a big drop of 23.8 
percent from the same period a year before. The forecast for the 
June 1994 settlement indicates that the profit from its main 
business will decline further by 32.5 percent or 70 billion yen, 
and will definitely fall below the 100 billion yen mark. 
  From the end of last year until this year when the recession 
and the high yen overlapped, Toyota evolved such internal 
company activities as "emergency VA [value analysis]," "VE 
[value engineering]," and the "special VA/VE," and implemented 
cost improvements totaling 100 billion yen. 
  The VA/VE method is a cost-improvement measure generally 
adopted by various automakers in recent years, and is a typical 
post-bubble cost-lowering step. There are various added-value 
factors for autos such as performance, comfort, and endurance. 
The aim of the VA/VE process is to analyze each aspect of 
performance and quality, reexamining them in detail as to 
whether there are any excessive or ineffective parts, and 
linking them to cost-cutting. 
  In the case of Japan's automakers, the ratio of parts made 
outside the company has reached 70-80 percent. Consequently, 
VA/VE activity naturally is a measure that has been adopted not 
only by the main Toyota company, but also by numerous parts 
makers. 
  The slimming down of the indirect sector has also started. 
Limiting the period from six months to two years and centering 
on the management sector, all sectors including the new sectors 
will participate in the operations reform project. 
  Toyota explains that, rather than indicating that it feels 
there is a surplus, it decisively halts work that can be halted. 
However, their explanation can be viewed as justifying the 
reshuffling that will affect about 20 percent of the personnel. 
For Toyota, which has never carried out any temporary transfer 
of sales personnel to the dealerships--a practice common among 
the other automakers, the act of reshuffling itself exposes 
extremely severe management circumstances. 
  It is also planned to drastically downsize plant and 
equipment [P&amp;E] investment. P&amp;E investment in the early 
period 
(June 1993 period) was initially set at 410 billion yen, but it 
was actually reduced by 130 billion to 280 billion yen. It will 
also be kept at a similar level for the current period. 
  Development investment in new cars and technology comprises 
50 percent of overall P&amp;E, and such drastic constraints will 
undoubtedly impact greatly on future plans for new car 
investments. 
  Personnel cutbacks are not limited to reshuffling in the 
management sector. They will also have a major impact on new 
hiring of high school male graduates in the production sector. 
As of this spring, the plan was to hire 1,000 new graduates, but 
it was decided by this fall to pare it down to 500, and notices 
to that effect were sent to high schools nationwide. In order to 
reduce the hiring of new graduates in the management sector 
also, the plan for next spring calls for 1,650 new employees, or 
850 less than this year. 
  Meanwhile, unprecedented moves are seen in the reappraisal 
of 
the production sector. Regarding the popular passenger-car 
Tercel Corsa series, a production system in the form of 
consigned production at Toyota's Takaoka plant (Toyoda City, 
Aichi Prefecture) and Hino Motor--an affiliated company--had 
been maintained previously. However, consignments to Hino Motor 
will be terminated at the end of this fiscal year, and will be 
concentrated at the Takaoka plant. From Toyota's viewpoint, 
consignment to Hino is surplus productivity, and it became 
necessary to terminate production at the two plants for 
efficient production. 
  This fall, Toyota will transfer the entire production of the 
Mark II from its Motomachi plant (ditto) to its new Kyushu 
plant. In accordance with this move, the surplus staff of more 
than 100 key employees at the Motomachi plant has been assigned 
to the group's chassis makers. Such aftermath effects of the 
bubble period are likely to surface in various forms in the 
future. 
<H3>  Nissan: Second Zama Plant To Close in 1995; Is "Profit at 
Zero Growth" Possible? </H3>
  Twice this year, Nissan Motor announced a full-fledged 
restructuring plan for the purpose of drastically improving its 
earnings capacity. The gist of the plan focused on the following 
two points. 1) To close its second Zama plant in the spring of 
1995, and 2) to lay off 5,000 of its personnel by 1995. 
  The major aim of the plant closure is "to create a capacity 
for adequate earnings at zero growth" (Atsushi Muramatsu, then 
vice president). Nissan has five complete-assembly plants 
throughout Japan and, by reducing them to four plants, 
productivity will change from 2.5 million cars to 2.25 million 
cars annually. In order to be profitable with production of 2 
million cars, capacity of 2.5 million production will become a 
burden. That is the reason for the decision to close the Zama 
plant. 
  The policy for the personnel cutback is based on a decisive 
constraint on hiring and not supplementing natural retirements. 
Simultaneously, it has also been decided to begin temporary 
assignment of indirect personnel to the dealerships. When the 
plan was announced, it was intended to lay off 5,000 workers "by 
the end of FY95." However, due to the subsequent sharp rise in 
the value of the yen, it was moved up by about a year, and 
implementation is targeted toward the end of FY94. Nissan's 
total employees reached 59,600 at its peak in March 1989 and, if 
the cutback plan is enforced, they will total 42,000. The figure 
of 42,000 will generally equal the level in 1970. 
  The hiring of new graduates next spring will also drop 
considerably. Although the plan calls for hiring of 200 college 
graduates--a 60-percent reduction from the number hired this 
spring, the probability is that it will fall below 200. At the 
outset, the hiring of 600 new high school graduates was 
scheduled for the production sector, but it was decided by this 
summer to cut the number by half to 300. Of course, the sharp 
yen rise from the spring to this summer provided the backdrop 
for the advancement of the cutback plan. 
  Nissan's restructuring policy is considered to be a typical 
reduce and balance policy, but it is actually farther advanced. 
The company's production figure for this fiscal year seems 
likely to undercut the original estimate by 160,000 cars and 
settle at 1.8 million cars. A production level of 1.8 million 
cars will result in the lowest record in some 20 years. The aim 
of the company's restructuring plan is to "secure profits even 
with 2 million cars." However, due to the export slump caused by 
the high yen, the actual production level already appears likely 
to fall greatly below the original estimate of "2 million cars." 
  The high yen has resulted in throwing cold water also on the 
earnings improvement measure based on bold restructuring. The 
company is firming up a decision to sell about 60 billion yen of 
its share holdings within this period, and this is based on the 
forecast of a deficit resulting from two consecutive periods of 
losses due to the high yen. Normally, the sale of shares as a 
company's settlement measure is intended with repurchase 
following the sale. However, it is likely to merely end in 
selling to lessen the company's capital burden. 
  The company's interest-bearing liabilities exceed 1 trillion 
yen, and employees at the Zama plant which approaches closure 
say: "Depending on the situation, we may have to resign and look 
for jobs elsewhere." The future of the restructuring still seems 
unclear. 
<H3>  Mazda: "Third Restructuring" Inevitable for Correction of 
the Bubble Expansion </H3>
  In September 1993, Mazda announced its forecast on the 
expanded operating deficit for the March 1994 period, and also 
revealed a new restructuring plan. Although the company had 
announced a rebuilding measure in May 1993, it was forced to 
reexamine the plan in view of the continuing recession and the 
sharp rise of the yen. 
  The company had scheduled a cutback of 1,500 employees 
during 
the next three years, but it has decided to lay off 3,000 
workers by the end of FY96 under the new plan. Although a halt 
to the production line was not clear in May, the recent 
announcement points to the closure of the third line (U3) in the 
Ujina district of the parent company, which is a new mainstay 
plant. 
  The breakdown of the rationalization of personnel includes 
1,000 direct employees and 2,000 indirect employees. Among the 
indirect employees, in addition to a drastic cut in hiring of 
new graduates, temporary assignments to dealerships will be 
increased from the present 200 to 1,000 employees. There will be 
an additional 650 employees (annually) who will retire. Among 
the direct employees, the policy is to cut by half the annual 
hiring of about 600, apart from the retirees. 
  Forming the backdrop of the need for such "supplemental" 
restructuring is the unexpected difficulty caused by the sharply 
rising yen. At the outset, Mazda had estimated a rate of 112-113 
yen to the dollar, but it actually climbed sharply to nearly 100 
yen. In the settlement forecast announced in September, the 
foreign exchange rate was adjusted to 105 yen to the dollar, and 
the early forecast saw an expansion of the operating deficit 
from 12 billion yen to 32 billion yen. 
  The company has a high export ratio of 60 percent, with its 
clients concentrated heavily in Europe, centering in Germany. 
However, because the recent high yen occurred not only against 
the dollar, but also tended to rise sharply against the mark, 
export profitability deteriorated and eventually suppressed 
earnings. 
  Mazda's restructuring measure was already being questioned 
at 
the time of the announcement in May by those concerned as to 
"whether it is adequate." The second restructuring measure was 
predominantly interpreted as an inevitable step, but the view is 
voiced by many that "perhaps even this is inadequate." 
  The reason is that sales policy and product policy were 
based 
on the rapid-growth bubble period, and are not able to respond 
to zero growth. Mazda has followed an expansionist policy by 
establishing a domestic five-channel sales system similar to 
Toyota and Nissan, and by introducing a unique model in each of 
the channels. However, the reality is that even Nissan faces 
difficulty in maintaining five channels. During the past five 
years, new models have been introduced successively in each of 
the five channels, but their penetration of the general users 
has been extremely insufficient, and the notification of car 
names cannot be said to be thorough. While massive CM's 
[expansion not given] are necessary for penetration among the 
users, funds are limited. Also, huge funds are required to 
narrow down the once-expanded commercial fronts. In view of this 
situation, it is not strange for a third restructuring plan to 
emerge. 
<H3>  Isuzu: Resources Concentrated in the Truck Sector With 
Withdrawal From Passenger Car Production </H3>
  Isuzu Motor has decided to withdraw from the passenger car 
sector as its ace card for management restructuring. Isuzu's 
passenger cars consist of the Gemini, the Aska and the Piazza 
models, with the Gemini playing a central role with an 
overwhelming number of cars produced and sold. In an inherently 
competitive class of autos for the masses, the Gemini was truly 
a remarkable car with a unique character as its weapon for 
survival. However, amid the post-bubble drop in overall demand, 
its sales have nosedived, and it has become a burden on the 
company's management. 
  For Isuzu, "how to deal with the passenger car sector" has 
been a major operational challenge during the past several 
years. The company fell into a deficit two years ago for the 
first time in five years in its October 1991 settlement and, 
even amid its restructuring, no clear direction was indicated 
regarding the nonprofitability in the passenger car sector. The 
company's number of passenger cars was 200,000 in 1985, but it 
fell to 72,000 in 1992. 
  During this period, technological innovation on passenger 
cars, including electronification made advances, and development 
investment grew unprecedentedly. The inability to win in such 
development competition and sales resulted in lowering its 
competitiveness in the passenger car sector. However, even amid 
the deficit settlements, no revival measures for the passenger 
car sector were indicated, and voices of doubt were heard among 
those concerned as to "what the company intended to do." 
  Ultimately, however, it was decided to discard the sector as 
a nonprofitable sector and to aim for management reconstruction 
under a production system with trucks as the commercial mainstay 
vehicles. Many evaluate such a clearcut decision as "far better 
than continuing the bloodletting endlessly." The reason is that 
withdrawal from the passenger car race not merely has a negative 
aspect, but also has various merits. 
  One positive aspect is that the limited management resources 
can be concentrated in the truck sector. In the truck industry, 
every company is desperately continuing research and development 
in order to clear the medium- and long-term regulations on 
diesel exhaust gases. Naturally, plenty of funds become 
necessary. However, withdrawal from the passenger car sector is 
expected to facilitate coping with exhaust emissions. 
  Also, passenger cars are directed toward the general 
consumers who are the ultimate users and, despite the "hits and 
misses," commercial vehicles such as trucks have mostly fixed 
users. Therefore, if commerciality in the hardware aspect can be 
ensured, it is difficult to fall into a broad decline. In other 
words, it is deemed that, compared to passenger cars, management 
plans for trucks can be easily formulated. The characteristic of 
such products is of course an extremely important element for a 
restructuring company like Isuzu which must follow a stabilized 
schedule. 
  The market scale of trucks is smaller than for passenger 
cars, and the profitability rate is not high. However, they have 
merit as a potentially sound business with little fluctuation. 
Although reducing the product lineup has its risks in a certain 
sense, the risks are smaller than maintaining a front line that 
drains the company's energies. It will probably become the final 
gamble for Isuzu, the distinguished automaker.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, December 30 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
Ambassador of the PRC to Mongolia Pei Jiayi said in an interview 
to the MONTSAME correspondent that 1993 was the year of further 
normal development of relations between China and Mongolia in 
the direction of strengthening of good-neighbourly friendship 
and cooperation. 
  Parliaments, governments, some army organs and public 
organizations of the two countries have achieved expansion of 
friendly exchange, extension of mutual understanding and mutual 
confidence, stregthening of friendship, development of 
cooperation. In 1993 the number of trade points has increased, 
and that of the opened points has reached 11. The border trade 
is developing on a large scale as never before. According to 
the present data, 103 joint enterprises of China and Mongolia 
are registered in Mongolia. 
  Relations between the two countries, said the ambassador, 
have wide perspectives for development, as China and Mongolia as 
the neighbouring countries are pursuing a friendly policy of 
good-neighbourliness. The peoples of the two countries have 
traditional friendship, the two states are developing trade 
relations, having many years history. And plus mutual 
supplement of economy of the two countries. 
  Pei Jiayi expressed confidence that owing to mutual efforts 
relations of good-neighbourly friendly cooperation between the 
two countries will develop and strengthen from day to day 
continuously, being based on five principles of peaceful 
coexistence.

<F P=106> [Report on "New Year interview" by unnamed MONTSAME </F>
correspondent with U.S. Ambassador to Mongolia D. Johnson; "The 
Day Will Come When Mongolia Will Render Assistance to Others..." 
-- MONTSAME headline; date and place not given] 
  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, December 30 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- 1. 
Question: Can you tell us about achievements in 
Mongolian-American relations during 1993? 
  Answer: Before anything else, on behalf of the government 
and people of the United States, I would like to wish the people 
of Mongolia a happy New Year 1994, and express the hope that the 
year will be full of success, good fortune, and happiness. 
  In 1993, our relations continued to show important and 
positive developments. I will cite just a few examples: the 
successful visit of Prime Minister Jasray to the United States 
in June, our statement in support of Mongolia's status as a 
nuclear free zone, the delivery of food and other aid to 
Mongolia in the spring and fall, and the deepening of our 
cultural and educational exhanges with the arrival of our press 
and cultural attache. These are developments for which both 
sides have worked hard and cooperated successfully, so we feel 
great satisfaction over our work this year. 
  2. Question: What would you like to say about the future of 
relations between Mongolia and the U.S.? 
  Answer: In a very short time, our two countries have 
established a very good foundation for stable, friendly and 
active relations. 
  As ambassador, I would like to continue to build on this 
foundation. 
  Of fundamental importance to our relations is our shared 
commitment to democracy, respect for human rights, political 
pluralism, and to a market economy. In this regard, the example 
given by the citizens of Mongolia in this year's presidential 
elections cannot be overlooked. President Ochirbat was 
re-elected in an open, fair, and internationally monitored 
election, an event that all people of Mongolia should feel great 
pride about. 
  Having said all of the above, I must add that there remains 
a 
great deal that we can do to further develop relations. For 
example, our economic links are still far below what they should 
be. Mongolia needs to intensify its efforts to attract 
investment to this country. We need to establish more contacts 
in the areas of science, information, and culture. These are 
things that I am working on as ambassador and will continue to 
pay attention to. 
  3. Question: What do you think about the current reform 
process in Mongolia? 
  Answer : My country supports Mongolia's efforts to make a 
successful transition to a market economy. These efforts have 
involved pain and sacrifice for many Mongolians, and for many 
people it may be hard to see progress. But there has been 
progress. Inflation during 1993 has slowed dramatically, and 
should continue to slow down in 1994. The decline in GDR 
[expansion unknown] has been reduced, and if present policies 
are continued, we believe that there will be positive economic 
growth in 1994. Some areas of business are already expanding, 
for example the textile sector. 
  The important thing is for Mongolia to keep ahead with the 
reform process, because it is beginning to show results. 
  More results will be visible in the next year or two. To 
help ease the transition, my country has provided food and 
economic assistance. We will continue to support your efforts. 
However, we also look forward to the day when Mongolia will be 
assisting others, and not receiving assistance from abroad.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, December 31 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- On the 
occasion of the coming New Year President of Mongolia P. 
Ochirbat has appealed with greetings to the Mongolian people. 
  In his speech the head of state has wished to all the 
Mongolian people that all their wishes would be implemented in a 
new year. The year of 1993 was full of noticeable events as for 
the whole mankind and for Mongolian people as well. 
  We are on the eve of the fifth year of democratic reforms 
started in 1989 succeeding to preserve national unity and 
political stability in spite of all the difficulties and 
complications being experienced in the course of implementation 
of those reforms. For the first time by all the nation was 
elected a head of state, generally accomplished the process of 
reorganization of one of branches of power the juridicial one. 
  So a formation of state organs has been completed which was 
intended for by the Constitution and basis for implementation of 
the fundamental constitutional conception on balanced 
distribution of powers has been created. At the same time a 
laborious work on ensuring a regular interactions of all the 
state structures activities at any level has been started. 
  However it is clear that there remains still great deal to 
do. As head of state he wished the year of 1994 to be a turning 
point for getting up the national economy and living standards 
of the people so that it will be the year of a considerable 
changes for the better for each Mongol and every family. He 
also wished that public order would be ensured in a democratic 
way in 1994, every citizen would be provided possibilities for 
enforcement of his constitutional rights and freedoms. 
  For this purpose our collective efforts, spiritual and 
creative work of everyone are needed. A clever state policy, 
flexible state correlation is needed as well. If we succeed in 
correlating the unity, knowledge and labour of all of us we will 
not have any difficulties arising out of ignorance and inability. 
  As the reforming processes in Mongolia are irreversible as 
the country's foreign policy is steadfast and stable. We are 
striving to further mutually beneficial equal cooperation with 
all states of the world including the Russian Federation and the 
People's Republic of China. As president of Mongolia I welcome 
the approval of a new Constitution of the Russian Federation. 
  On the occasion of New Year I express a cordial gratitude to 
all the international organizations countries and peoples who 
since the very beginning have been rendering assistance and 
support to processes of democratization and reforming in 
Mongolia, he said. 
  The president of Mongolia noted with gratitude that the 
statements by nuclear powers in support of the statement of 
Mongolia on nuclear free zone were of importance for ensuring 
the independence and security for our country by political 
methods.

important step in strengthening the democratic state system in

said the Mongolian Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray in his 
interview granted to the newspaper "MONGOL MESSENGER" the prime

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, December 31 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- This 
year we managed to preserve the social and political stability 
which is the most significant result of the year, said in his 
interview to the MONTSAME correspondent leader of the MPRP 
Budragchaagiyn Dash-Yondon. Concerning the national economy the 
government started functioning at the level of intersector 
correlation as compared to the previous years. 
  The period of extraordinary emergency measures is over, he 
considers. In the next year there would be laid down basis for 
restoration of national economy and there is a danger of 
stagnation. 
  The process of legislatively ensuring the achievements in 
the 
sphere of protection of human rights and freedom is going on. 
In this regard we are committing errors sometimes and taking 
wrong decisions but it is not intentionally he noted. 
  The opposite opinions on this matters were expressed by 
leaders of the opposition parties Dabaadorjiyn Ganbold an B. 
Batbayar. Leader of the National Democratic Party (MNDP) 
Dabaadorjiyn Ganbold said that the process of reforming is still 
continuing in the country but a lot of questions to be solved 
urgently are still out of field of vision of the government. 
The ruling party experiences a lack of civil and political will 
for taking really burning measures which is in its turn 
connected with the absence of a clear cut conception on 
reforming the society. It seemed that we are going on the path 
of extremely underdeveloped countries not having a weighty voice 
even in their own region and dragging out a miserable existence 
by receiving humanitarian assistance of other countries. 
  Owing to efforts of the present leadership we have entered 
ourselves to the ranks of the most under-developed countries. 
The ruling party and the government are being guided by 
momentary needs. As a whole we begin to fail in all positions 
having been reached during the previous years leader of the MSDP 
[Mongolian Social-Democratic Party] B. Batbayar said. It is 
time to understand that the way back is a fatal way, he stressed.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 4 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- According 
to preliminary results released by the Statistical Board of 
Mongolia here today, during the counting of the cattle number 
conducted at the end of the last year, there are some 25 million 
172.5 thousand head of cattle of five kinds registered in 
Mongolia. 
  That is by 521.6 thousand less than in 1992. Among the five 
kinds of animals there is observed an increase in the number 
only for goats. As is shown by the preliminary data there are 
some 367.4 thousand camels, 2,189.8 thousand horses, 2,730.4 
thousand bovine, 13,778 thousand sheep and 6,106.9 thousand 
goats in the country. 
  In 13 out of 18 aymags of the country the total number of 
cattle has recorded to be reduced. Among the consequences of 
the natural calamity occurred in the three western aymags of 
Mongolia, the growth of cattle number has been affected by an 
uncontrolled slaughter of meat and a remarkable weakening of 
maintenance and care of animals provided in many cattlebreeding 
units. [sentence as received] This might be seen from the fact 
that the six aymags with the most favourable weather conditions 
for the last winter-spring period failed to increase the number 
of cattle, specialists of the statistical board points out.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 6 KYODO -- Malaysia hopes a 
report that Japan has decided to back the proposed East Asia 
Economic Caucus (EAEC) is accurate since Tokyo's participation 
will augur well for the region's economic development, a top 
official said Thursday [6 January]. 
  "It means Japan is at last fully convinced that not only is 
it geographically right in the midst of East Asia, but it 
belongs to East Asia," said International Trade and Industry 
Minister Rafidah Aziz. 
  "It's good if the report is true that Japan has now decided 
to recognize the EAEC," she said, commenting on a report 
Wednesday in a Japanese daily that quoted government sources as 
saying that Tokyo has reversed its cautious EAEC stance. 
  The ASAHI SHIMBUN report said the new position hopes to 
create a "diplomatic balance" in the Pacific region following 
implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) among the United States, Canada and Mexico at the 
weekend, and to curb U.S. dominance in the 17-member 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum which held its 
first summit in Seattle in November. 
  The news report was carried on the front pages of all major 
Malaysian newspapers Thursday. The Japanese Foreign Ministry 
declined to comment on it. 
  Rafidah added that Japan joining the EAEC should not detract 
Tokyo's network with groupings in other parts of the world. 
[sentence as received] 
  The six-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN) 
hopes to lure Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan 
into forming the EAEC hopefully by this year, but only China has 
so far publicly welcomed the grouping. ASEAN groups Brunei, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. 
  Japan and South Korea have been noncommittal over their 
participation after the previous U.S. Administration of 
President George Bush strongly opposed the exclusive Asian 
grouping, saying it is a potential trading bloc. 
  Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed proposed the EAEC 
in late 1990 when the recently concluded Uruguay Round of talks 
to free the global trading system was bogged down mainly by 
disputes between the U.S. and the European Community. 
  The ASAHI report said the conclusion of the talks allows 
Japan to reverse its stance on the EAEC which it feared would 
have hampered the round that was held under the General 
Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  It added the change was also due to Japan's concern that 
NAFTA is evolving into an exclusive bloc, especially since 
president Bill Clinton used the threat of Japan edging out the 
U.S in Mexico to garner support for NAFTA from the U.S. Congress.

  [Text] Singapore -- Singapore's manufactured exports 
returned to double-digit growth of 12.4 percent in volume terms 
in November after a 9.8 percent increase in October. 
  Figures released by the Trade and Development Board 
yesterday 
led private sector economists to concede that non-oil domestic 
exports in the fourth quarter will be stronger than they had 
originally expected. 
  This is particularly true in the light of official gross 
domestic product growth forecast of 9.8 percent for 1993, which 
means a 12 percent GDP growth in the fourth quarter. 
  While the financial services sector is likely to account for 
a large part of GDP growth, economists believe the export and 
manufacturing sectors must also have done well in the fourth 
quarter. 
  In the beginning of last year, many of them said non-oil 
domestic exports would moderate from the second half of the year 
due to the high base in the same period of 1992. However, that 
did not materialize. 
  Except for October, non-oil domestic exports continued to 
show double-digit growth well into 1993. 
  Non-oil domestic exports are the most watched export 
indicator for Singapore because they point to the health of the 
local manufacturing sector. 
  Economists told BT [Business Times] that the recovery in the 
OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) 
countries, particularly the U.S., had underpinned the strength 
of Singapore's manufactured exports, and growth this year will 
continue to be U.S.-led. 
  Nevertheless, non-oil domestic exports to the U.S. in 
November came against the high base the year before, and grew by 
only 1.6 percent. 
  Similarly, exports to the EC, which led the export boom in 
late 1992, contracted by 0.1 percent in November. 
  Ray Farris, economist with Crosby Securities, cautioned 
against intrepeting the U.S. and EC markets as being "dead". 
"Part of the OECD restructuring has led to the relocation of a 
lot of industries. So Singapore may be supplying disk drives, 
semiconductors and peripherals to Hong Kong and Taiwan, which 
are then ultimately used in the U.S. and EC," he said. 
  In November, exports to Hong Kong and Taiwan grew by 20.7 
percent and 30.3 percent in volume terms respectively. Non-oil 
domestic exports to these second-tier markets have had some of 
the best showings last year. 
  Overall, non-oil domestic exports grew in November due to 
the 
increased demand for integrated circuits, disk drives, 
microcomputers, printers, computer parts and peripherals as well 
as picture tubes for colour TVs. 
  On the other trade fronts, the volume of domestic oil 
exports 
rose by 19.3 percent, but falling prices kept the rise in the 
value of oil exports at just 2.4 percent. 
  Total trade volume rose by 11.4 percent, while the value of 
total trade grew by 11.2 percent to $22 billion [Singapore 
currency]. The trade deficit narrowed to $1.1 billion.

  [Text] The curbs on the circulation of THE ECONOMIST 
magazine will be lifted from the 15th of this month when it is 
degazetted as a declared foreign newspaper. The magazine was 
gazetted in August last year for refusing to print a reply from 
the government. The reply was sent by Singapore's high 
commissioner in London to rebut a letter which Mr. J.B. 
Jeyaretnam [former opposition MP] wrote to the magazine about 
his 1986 criminal conviction. At the time of gazetting, THE 
ECONOMIST had a circulation of 7,500 copies here. The government 
had then said it would reduce the circulation progressively. A 
statement from the Ministry of Information and the Arts said 
with the degazetting, THE ECONOMIST will not need to appoint an 
authorized distributor. It will also not be required to have 
all its copies marked with stickers.

  [Text] On 24 December, the Broadcast Satellite System 
Corporation [BSSC] (based in Shibuya, Tokyo, with Toshio Kataoka 
as president), announced that it awarded a contract to U.S. 
Hughes Corporation to build the BS-4, Japan's next-in-line 
broadcast satellite. The BSSC, which has been set up for the 
purchase of broadcast satellites, is funded by the Japan 
Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) and other investors. Originally, 
the cost of one such satellite was thought to be around 10 
billion yen. Although the contracted purchase price was not 
disclosed, it is believed to be considerably below this figure. 
This is the first time the Hughes Corporation has won a 
contract for building a Japanese broadcast satellite. A 
consortium consisting of the U.S. Martin Marietta Corporation, 
Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, and NEC Corporation was 
initially considered the likely winner of the procurement bid, 
but wound up losing. 
  In addition to the Hughes Corporation and the Martin 
Marietta 
consortium, the U.S. Space Systems Loral (SSL) Corporation was 
another participant in the bid for procurement of the BS-4. 
Japanese firms had given up on entering the bid as main 
contractors due to such problems as cost and the length of lead 
time for delivery. Among major Japanese satellite makers, 
however, Mitsubishi and NEC entered the bid in a consortium with 
Martin Marietta, and the Toshiba Corporation similarly entered 
the bid in a consortium with the SSL. Since the Hughes 
Corporation entered the bid alone, Japanese firms have been 
completely cut off from the project to build the BS-4. 
  The new broadcast satellite will replace the BS-3, which is 
currently utilized by NHK and the Japan Satellite Broadcasting 
Incorporated (operator of the WOWOW channel). It is the third 
satellite the procurement of which became subject to 
international tender since Japan and the United States concluded 
an agreement in 1990 to open the satellite market. The main 
satellite and a backup spare unit are scheduled to be launched 
in the summer of 1997 and the summer of 1998, respectively. 
They are said to be designed with an expected lifespan of over 
10 years. 
  Originally, the general consensus was that the 
Martin-Mitsubishi-NEC consortium would be the likely winner of 
the procurement contract for the BS-4, since Martin Marietta has 
taken over the aerospace department of the General Electric 
Company (GE), which has so far monopolized the Japanese 
broadcast satellite market. Concerning reasons for Hughes 
Corporation's advance into the Japanese market, a majority of 
sources concerned believe "the fact that Hughes was able to 
offer a much better price than Martin Marietta was the decisive 
factor in the former's emerging victorious in the bid."

  [Text] On 27 December, Minister of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] Hiroshi Kumagai, commented on Mazda Motor 
Corporation's decision to strengthen its cooperative ties with 
Ford Motors, saying: "It is highly desirable from the 
perspective of Japanese and U.S. auto industries building up 
cooperative relations." Automobiles remain a major contributor 
to Japan's large trade surplus, and have been made an issue in 
the Japan-U.S. comprehensive economic talks. As such, Kumagai 
praised the Japanese and U.S. industries' efforts to create 
cooperative relations on their own. 
  But this agreement on beefed-up cooperation, while bringing 
Ford executives into Mazda operations, promises little in the 
areas of production and sales. Consequently, some MITI 
officials think: "Mazda, which is in a business slump, maybe 
wanted to show its workers and the public that the company is 
now regaining stability with the support of Ford." 
  Domestic automobiles are now in oversupply as a result of 
flagging domestic demand and the prolonged appreciation of the 
yen. MITI (a senior official) thinks: "Domestic makers ought to 
take drastic measures such as production cutbacks or 
reorganization," and hopes the Ford-Mazda cooperation will be an 
opportunity for domestic makers to go further toward 
restructuring.

"Putting Pressure on Japan To Get Pledges on Expanded Purchase"] 
  [Text] There are two purposes for U.S. Trade 
Representative Michael Kantor calling for an emergency meeting 
under the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement. One is to request 
Japan to promise further expansion of its purchase of foreign 
semiconductors in 1994 and thereafter, and the other is to 
secure explanatory material to be given to the U.S. Congress and 
domestic industry in case the [foreign semiconductors'] average 
share of 20 percent [in the Japanese market] in 1993 is not 
achieved. 
  Kantor has presented two conditions for implementing the 
agreement: (1) steady growth of the share, and (2) achievement 
of an average of 20 percent in the share in 1993. But these 
conditions are not going to be met. While it is necessary to 
raise the foreign products' share for the October-December 
period to 23.1 percent to meet the 20-percent target for the 
whole year, all Japanese corporations concerned have already 
placed their orders for the year, and "achievement of the target 
is hopeless" (according to an official of the U.S. industry). 
  Upon hearing the U.S. Government announcement [on the 
emergency meeting], Procasini [name as published], managing 
director of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), 
issued a statement supporting such an emergency meeting. The 
Semiconductor Agreement is due to be revised next year. He 
apparently thinks "the United States can achieve more by 
extracting practical promises in the talks on such matters as 
raising the market share" than by just criticizing Japan. 
  The U.S. Government -- going all out to get its way on trade 
policy as seen in getting the NAFTA approved -- is putting 
emphasis on obtaining agreements on priority topics in the 
economic consultations at the Japan-U.S. summit in February. 
Consequently, while it assumes a flexible stand on the question 
of setting objective criteria, it demands strict implementation 
in areas where there are agreements -- as in semiconductors, 
construction projects, and cellular phones. In other words, the 
United States is engaged in "two-pronged operations." 
  Lawrence Summers, U.S. under secretary of the treasury, in a 
28 December TV interview, put pressure on Japan, saying, "I hope 
they (Japan) will keep their word." Meanwhile, Trade 
Representative Kantor has not changed his hard-line position on 
the Semiconductor Agreement, hinting at the possibility of 
enforcing sanctions. But his real purpose is to include the 
semiconductors as a topic in the Japan-U.S. economic 
consultations in January and February -- before the summit -- 
and to force a political decision out of Japan and get the 
maximum possible concessions from it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Japanese-U.S. Economic Consultations </F>
Winding Up; Rift Remains on `Objective Criteria' Question; Focus 
Now Centered on Whether Accord Should Apply To NTT"] 
  [Text] The Japanese-U.S. economic consultations are 
entering their finale -- with the hope of arriving at a 
conclusion by the time of the Japanese-U.S. summit meeting in 
February. Starting with the working group session on government 
procurement in the telecommunications sector, sector-by-sector 
talks will be held in Washington and Tokyo to deal with priority 
areas of government procurement of medical equipment, insurance, 
and automobiles and auto parts. In the focal issue of 
"objective criteria," the United States is showing a flexible 
position of not caring so much about numerical targets as it did 
before, but Japan thinks that "the U.S. stand has not changed 
much." Apparently, the rift between the two countries has not 
been patched. With only a month left before the time for 
concluding the talks, a tough verbal war is expected in them. 
<H5>  U.S. Softens Position </H5>
  The economic consultations on the priority areas are 
supposed 
to arrive at a conclusion before 11 February, when the 
Japanese-U.S. summit is set to be held. The working group talks 
will be succeeded by vice-ministerial-level talks of the 
ministries and departments concerned. Thus, the consultations 
will be entering a final phase of negotiations in early February. 
  The major hurdle in the sector-by-sector talks will be the 
vice-ministerial-level talks on automobiles and auto parts to be 
held in Tokyo in mid-January and in Washington later in the 
month. In the negotiations so far, both Japan and the United 
States have presented their own drafts of agreement, and the 
final negotiations will center on the "objective criteria" aimed 
at measuring the degree of market access. As for the question 
of objective criteria, there has been a clash between the United 
States, which wants to fix the future sales targets as the 
numerical targets, and Japan, which is opposed to doing that. 
  But more recently, when an official of the Office of the 
U.S. 
Trade Representative visited Japan in December, he indicated 
that the United States has softened its position on the matter. 
The official said, "We are not asking that numerical targets be 
set." On the other hand, Jeffrey Garten, under secretary of 
commerce for international trade, insisted that there is a need 
to find a way which replaces numerical targets as a yardstick 
for measuring matters. He declared, "There is no change in our 
position in wanting Japan to increase its purchases of U.S.-made 
automobiles and auto parts." 
<H5>  Japan Not Relaxing Its Guard </H5>
  Regarding this U.S. position, a top official of the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry [MITI] noted: "The United 
States is now using expressions like standards and indicators, 
and the difference of their meanings from that of targets is not 
clear. If they are something similar [to the meaning of 
targets], we will reject them." A senior official of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] insisted: "The United States 
is asking Japan to increase (the share of foreign products on 
the Japanese market) to the level practiced by the seven 
industrial (G-7) nations. But that is equivalent to accepting 
numerical targets." Japan thinks that the United States' basic 
position has not changed, and Japan is not about to relax its 
guard now. 
  Rough sailing is expected in negotiations on other priority 
sectors as well. In the area of government procurement of 
telecommunications equipment, it has become clear that the 
United States wants to apply the draft agreement to the Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corporation [NTT] to increase 
opportunities for the sale of U.S. products [in Japan]. But 
Japan persists in saying that a private-sector business cannot 
be governed by a government-to-government treaty. It is likely 
that the NTT issue will become a moot point in the working group 
meeting which is to start on 4 January. 
<H5>  Possibility of Being Pressured Into Making Concessions </H5>
  What is casting a dark cloud on the future of the 
Japanese-U.S. economic consultations is the offensive of the 
United States, which is hinting at the possibility of taking 
retaliatory actions. Late last month, the United States set 15 
February as the date by which it would decide whether to enforce 
retaliation on Japan with respect to market access on such 
sectors as automobiles and telephones -- under the U.S. trade 
act. The country had earlier set 20 January as the date by 
which it would decide whether to enforce retaliation on the 
construction sector. Apparently, the United States is poised to 
make all-out attacks on Japan before the Japanese-U.S. summit. 
  Last year, the U.S. Congress approved NAFTA, the GATT's 
Uruguay Round of talks came to a successful conclusion, and 
several major trade issues were resolved. Now the eyes of 
Europe and Asia are turned on the progress that the 
Japanese-U.S. economic consultations are making. 
  A senior MITI official said emphatically: "With the Uruguay 
Round of talks having been successfully concluded, the trend 
toward maintaining the free trade system has been set. There is 
no way we can agree to a settlement which would lead to managed 
trade." But as long as Japan maintains its large trade surplus, 
it is true, as a top MOFA official admitted, "that Japan will be 
required to make more concessions [than the United States]." 
The possibility is predictable that eventually Japan will be 
pressured by the United States into making concessions.

  [Text] With the conclusion of the latest multilateral 
trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), Japan is now committed 
to giving foreign rice exporters minimum access to the Japanese 
rice market beginning in 1995. Now, the United States has 
informally asked the Japanese Government that American-grown 
rice account for 40-60 percent of rice imported under the 
minimum access arrangements. This was disclosed on 3 January by 
a source familiar with Japan-U.S. trade negotiations. The 
United States, which is trying to increase its exports of rice 
to Japan, is believed to have made the informal request with the 
aim of securing a long-term share of the Japanese rice market. 
The government does not want to adopt a country-by-country 
quota system for fear of drawing criticism from other rice 
exporting nations. The United States is expected to press hard 
for its demand in the future and the Japanese Government is 
likely to face difficulties in dealing with the U.S. demand. 
  Japan has committed itself to partially opening its rice 
market. It will have to import about 400,000 tons of rice, or 4 
percent of domestic rice consumption, in 1995 and increase 
imports to about 800,000 tons, or 8 percent of the domestic rice 
consumption six years later. 
  The Uruguay Round multilateral trade agreement decided to 
delay the enforcement of tariffication for six years and to 
adopt a "special exception" under which minimum access would 
increase. It is said strong pressure from the United States was 
behind the decision. 
  The U.S. Rice Millers Association (RMA) and American rice 
exporters point out that "the price of American-grown rice is 
relatively higher than Thai rice and that American rice may not 
sell on the Japanese rice market." The prevailing view among 
the RMA and American rice exporters is that it would be 
advantageous for American rice exporters to secure an export 
quota to Japan for six years and use this to increase their 
share of the market. 
  The acreage of rice paddies in Arkansas and California where 
medium- and small-grained rice (the Japonika variety) is grown 
has expanded since Japan decided to partially open its rice 
market and enthusiasm in the two states for exporting rice to 
Japan is gradually growing. 
  The request from the U.S. Government is said to be like a 
country-by-country quota under which each exporting nation is 
allotted a fixed quantity which Japan will import. The Japanese 
Government, however, does not like the idea. 
  A source at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries said: "We cannot set a country-by-country rice import 
quota in writing and notify each rice exporting nation of it." 
  The Japanese Government is believed to take such a dim view 
of the U.S. request after concluding that, "if Japan proposes 
adopting a country-by-country quota system in multilateral trade 
negotiations, it could not avoid facing criticism from such 
major rice exporting nations as Thailand and Australia." 
  Under the current stable food control system, the government 
is obliged to manage the rice that is imported under the minimum 
access arrangements. 
  A spokesman for the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and 
Fisheries said: "We will make a comprehensive decision on which 
countries Japan should import rice from after examining the use 
and price of rice and the capabilities of the rice exporting 
nations involved." 
  Some government officials, however, take the view that given 
the past history of bilateral trade negotiations, Japan will 
have no choice but to accept the U.S. demand.

  [Text] The "Japan-North Korea Provisional Nongovernmental 
Accord on Fishing," which allows Japanese fishing boats to 
operate within 200 nautical miles of North Korean waters, is 
expected to expire at the end of this year. This was disclosed 
on 25 December by a source familiar with Japan-North Korea 
relations. The accord was first concluded between 
nongovernmental organizations of the two countries in 1977, and 
it has since been extended almost every two years. This time, 
however, there have been no prospects for consultations on 
extending the accord on the eve of its expiration. Difficult 
relations between Japan and North Korea following the suspension 
of normalization talks and the issue of North Korea's suspected 
nuclear development are believed to have adversely affected the 
extension of the accord. 
  If the accord is invalidated, it would make it impossible 
for 
Japanese fishermen in the Hokuriku and Sanin regions to continue 
catching squid in the eastern waters near the Korean peninsula. 
A North Korean source in Tokyo, however, says: "Japanese 
fishermen usually begin catching squid in spring following a 
three-month break from January to March, so they should not 
suffer any damage for the time being." 
  Hajime Fukada, a member of the House of Councilors (from the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan), plans to visit North Korea on 
28 December to sound out North Korean intentions.

  [Text] The government has decided to deal positively with 
Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir's proposal to 
establish the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC). 
  In view of U.S. concern over a new economic bloc in Asia, 
Japan has been taking a prudent stand toward the proposal for an 
economic cooperation mechanism to be organized by ASEAN, Japan, 
the ROK, and China. Japan's policy change is aimed at 
demonstrating Japan's policy of attaching importance to ties 
with ASEAN, for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
ministers conference is going to have summit talks on a regular 
basis. Also, Japan wants to check U.S. moves to make the North 
America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) an exclusionary economic 
bloc. 
  The government intends to propose to ASEAN nations that they 
design the EAEC as a consultative body open to the world. 
  The concept of the EAEC is based on Prime Minister 
Mahathir's 
1990 proposal for the East Asia Economic Group (EAEG). At that 
time, the United States and Australia strongly opposed the 
proposal, saying that the EAEG was "an attempt to divide the 
Pacific region." Taking this into account, the EAEC was 
redesigned to not give the impression of a protectionist 
economic bloc. The framework of the EAEC is now under debate at 
the ASEAN economic ministers conference. While some quarters say 
that the EAEC should start as a subsidiary of APEC, details have 
not yet been determined. 
  The Japanese Government has not clarified its stand toward 
the EAEC proposal in consideration of the positions of ASEAN, 
the United States, and Australia. Japan also thought that its 
participation in discussions on regional frameworks might affect 
developments in the Uruguay Round negotiations, which sought a 
global framework. 
  Japan's policy change is based on the following factors: 1) 
The Uruguay Round has already been concluded successfully; 2) 
When the United States announced its "emphasis on the Pacific 
region" at APEC's Seattle summit in November, ASEAN nations 
strongly expressed their concern over U.S. hegemony in Asia; and 
3) ASEAN nations also expressed their concern over the 
exclusionary nature of NAFTA. 
  The government once welcomed the U.S. House's approval of 
NAFTA; however, the Foreign Ministry was displeased with the 
Clinton administration's attempt to use the "Japan threat" in 
persuading the House by stressing that "Japan will invade Mexico 
if NAFTA fails to pass." 
  Under such circumstances, the government judged that Japan 
had better to take part in the "open" EAEC to balance its 
diplomatic policies toward Asia and the United States.

  [Text] The Finance Ministry made it clear on 31 December 
that it would lower the growth rate of the Official Development 
Assistance (ODA) in the general account of the 1994 budget from 
the 1993 level of 6.5 percent to 3 percent on grounds of the 
tight fiscal situation. The Finance Ministry is maintaining 
that it would be possible to keep the ODA at a high level in 
U.S. dollar terms due to the appreciation of the yen. The 
Foreign Ministry, however, is contending that it is necessary to 
increase the ODA by more than 5 percent in order for Japan to 
make clear its attitude toward international contributions. 
Hence, the two ministries are expected to wage a fierce battle 
over 4 percent. [sentence as published] 
  The government, in the 5th ODA Medium-Term Plan (from 1993 
to 
1997) set in June 1993, announced its commitment to a total of 
$70-70.5 billion in the ODA over five years. It is necessary to 
continue to raise the ODA by 7 percent every year in dollar 
terms to fulfill the commitment. In late August last year, the 
foreign minister asked for 1,098.4 billion yen for the ODA in 
its preliminary budget request for the fiscal 1994 and the 
amount was up 8.3 percent from that of a year earlier. 
  In response, the finance minister plans to curb the ODA's 
growth at 3 percent, claiming that: 1) we have no choice but to 
keep the ODA's growth in check; and 2) it is possible to 
maintain the ODA at a high level thanks to the drastic 
appreciation of the yen. The Finance Ministry is also asserting 
that the country's "ODA is the world's greatest in absolute 
terms, and the ODA needs to shift its priority from quantity to 
quality," (according to the Budget Bureau). The ministry plans 
to study the possibility of increasing the amount of technical 
assistance it gives after concluding that to help developing 
countries develop their industries, the ODA must focus on the 
development of human resources rather than on one-time grant aid. 
  Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry is saying that given the 
appreciated yen, sluggish growth in the ODA is inevitable. 
However, the ministry is strongly arguing that it is necessary 
to raise the ODA by 5 percent in order for Japan to make clear 
its posture toward international contributions. Hence, 
coordination of views between the two ministries is likely to 
run into problems.

<F P=106> ["Traitors Seeking Confrontation, Not National Unity"--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
group of traitors seeking confrontation and war against the 
desire of the nation for reunification will never get off 
scotfree, warns NODONG SINMUN in an article today. 
  Recalling that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique last year 
viciously incited confrontation between the North and the South 
and tried to provoke a war, availing itself of the 
anti-socialist moves of the international reactionaries to 
stifle the DPRK, the author of the article says: 
  Upon the publication of the 10-point programme of the great 
unity of the whole nation, we sent letters calling for 
reunification in the 1990s through concerted efforts of the 
nation to the authorities, representatives of the political 
parties and organisations and personages of all strata of South 
Korea. The South Korean puppets, however, did not convey the 
letters to the addressees, totally froze North-South dialogues 
which had continued during the preceding military dictatorship 
and barred a North-South reunification soccer game and a 
reunification concert. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group not only persistently opposed our 
sincere offers for promoting national harmony and unity but also 
resumed, in league with outside forces, the "Team Spirit" 
nuclear war exercises which had been suspended toward the end of 
the rule of the "sixth republic". After the "Team Spirit" 
nuclear war exercises, it staged war manoeuvres such as 
"Ssangyong", "Ulchi", "Ulchi Focus Lens", "Foal Eagle" and 
"Hwarang" in succession. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam in combat uniform of the puppet 
Army 
frequented frontline units and fields of military drill near the 
Military Demarcation Line, inciting confrontation and war. 
Worse still, he flew to the United States and entreated his 
masters to "exercise a powerful influence" and establish "an 
international cooperation system," crying over "suspicion of 
nuclear development" by the DPRK. 
  The whole nation clearly sees that with the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam left alone, harmony and unity between the North and the 
South cannot be achieved nor can peace and peaceful 
reunification of the country be realised but nconfrontation and 
war between the fellow countrymen will be inevitable. 
  The South Korean puppet clique will face a stern judgement 
by 
history and the people.

"Belligerent Outbursts by Warmongers"] 
  [Text] From the beginning of the year, the South Korean 
warmongers have been running amok in instigating war fever which 
is making the situation in our country extremely tense. 
  According to broadcast reports from Seoul, the joint chiefs 
of staff of the puppet defense ministry and the army, navy, and 
air force held a so-called ceremony marking the start of the 
work for the year on 3 January. Puppet defense minister Yi 
Pyong-tae, in the ceremony, raved that the army on the ground, 
the navy on the sea, and the air force in the sky should 
maintain a strong combat posture in the new year. 
  The chairman of the puppet joint chiefs of staff vociferated 
that the military posture should be rounded off to counter the 
North's threat of war and a posture of prompt counteraction 
should be established. He, prattling on about the relations of 
military cooperation between the United States and South Korea, 
enumerated the effective management of the U.S. Forces' rapid 
deployment deterrent force and the development of the U.S.-South 
Korean joint defense posture. In the ceremony, the puppet army 
chief of staff, chief of naval operations, and air force chief 
of staff also bellowed bellicose outbursts. 
  Such belligerent power-reeking outbursts by the heads of the 
puppet military circles from the beginning of the year blatantly 
reveal their scheme of armed confrontation with us and they are 
an intolerable grave challenge to the fellow countrymen who 
aspire to peace and reunification of the country. 
  As it is well known, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, 
stressing in his New Year address that the fatherland's 
reunification is the supreme task of our people which must not 
be delayed, again clarified that our party and the government of 
our Republic will make every effort to reunify the country in 
the form of confederation which is based on one nation, one 
state, two systems and two governments; on the three principles 
of independence, peaceful reunification, and great national 
unity. 
  All the compatriots in the North, South, and overseas, on 
hearing the New Year address, fervently support and welcome the 
principled stance regarding the fatherland's reunification 
clarified by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song and 
turn out in a struggle to implement it, saying that it is a 
programmatic guideline that breaks a deadlock lying in the way 
of the reunification and peacefully expedites the cause of the 
country's reunification by means of the nation's independent 
strength. 
  The South Korean warmongers clique, however, gathered in one 
place, hatched the war conspiracy and enumerated provocative 
outbursts. These facts clearly prove that the South Korean 
puppets are anti-dialogue, anti-reunification elements who have 
no will to work for peace and reunification. 
  What cannot be overlooked is the fact that the South Korean 
puppets are prattling on about military cooperation with outside 
forces instead of exerting their efforts to end the country's 
division in order to achieve national reconciliation and unity. 
In fact, the rascals are attempting to keep the U.S. Forces in 
South Korea forever and collude with them to provoke war aimed 
at northward invasion against their fellow countrymen. 
  Last year, the South Korean puppets--ignoring the 10-point 
program of the great unity of the whole nation which is 
acceptable to anyone who wants the country's reunification and 
our proposal for peace to exchange special envoys aimed at 
discussing and resolving the pending issues between the North 
and South--have staged a large scale war exercises almost every 
day, including the Team Spirit war exercise--a test nuclear war 
and a preliminary war, with the United States and have resorted 
to anti-Republic intrigues, vociferating about military 
countermeasure. 
  Puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, wandering about in units on the 
front line dressed in a puppet army uniform, did not hesitate to 
commit acts of stirring up war fever. Successive belligerent 
outbursts, such as calling for a posture of prompt 
counteraction, enumerated by the South Korean warmongers clique 
from the beginning of the year are done in the projected line of 
such anti-Republic intrigues. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's insidious acts of 
deliberately straining the situation and continuously taking the 
road of northward provocation, challenging all compatriots who 
unanimously aspire to peace and reunification of the country, 
will never be tolerated. If the rascals continue to go on the 
road of war aimed at northward invasion in the new year, they 
will not be safe. We will control the fire with fire and give a 
strict punishment to the provokers. 
  The South Korean puppets must stop behaving rashly, clearly 
realizing that their acts of pushing the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to an acute phase of confrontation will only result in 
their own self-destruction. They should better take the road of 
great national unity and reunification in conformity with the 
aspiration and demand of compatriots.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- "70 million fellow 
countrymen should put an end to the tragedy of national division 
with the great unity of the whole nation," said Cho Il-min, 
chief of the Pyongyang mission of the South Korean National 
Democratic Front (Hanminjon), at a press conference at his 
mission Thursday. 
  He said that vanguard fighters of Hanminjon and people of 
different strata in the Southern part of the country were 
renewing their unshakable will to achieve the cause of national 
reunification with the motive force of the nation in hearty 
response to the reunification programme reclarified by the great 
leader President Kim Il-song in his New Year address. 
  The Kim Yong-sam regime, he said, declared from the 
beginning 
that it would improve South-North relations, placing the nation 
above anything else, but has actually committed such 
anti-national acts as further aggravating the North-South 
confrontation, turning away the North's broadminded proposals 
such as exchange of presidential envoys and the nation's desire 
for reunification and persistently resorting to the policy of 
dependence on outside forces. 
  Hanminjon held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee 
of its Central Committee in Seoul on January 2 and solemnly 
vowed to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam regime, declaring its 
resolute break with the regime, together with the people in the 
South aspiring after independence, democracy and reunification, 
Cho Il-min noted, and stated: 
  The time has gone to watch the "civilian" regime or to 
expect 
something from it. 
  It is the general review and will of our people in the South 
that the Kim Yong-sam "regime" should no longer be left intact. 
  Hanminjon and patriotic people of different strata in the 
South will defend the banner of national independence till they 
have achieved independence, democracy and reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets are engaged in frantic joint air 
war exercises against the North from the beginning of the year, 
rendering the situation on the Korean peninsula strained, 
according to military sources. 
  On the fifth of January, formations of nuclear-capable F-16 
fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes and VTOL [vertical 
takeoff and landing] assault planes based in Japan and flying 
corps of the U.S. Airforce present in South Korea and the puppet 
airforce staged bombing exercises aimed at striking the 
strategic depths of the northern half of Korea in the skies 
above Yongwol, Wonju and Tokjok Islet under the command of an 
E-3 early warning plane. 
  More 360 war planes of various types were flown in the 
manoeuvres. 
  That day, KC-135 tankers refuelled scores of fighter-bombers 
in the aerial war exercises in the sky above the sea off Kunsan. 
  On January 4 and 5, RV-1, RC-12, RF-4C, EH-60, and other 
types of spy planes committed an all-round aerial espionage on 
the coastal and frontline areas of the northern half of Korea in 
the skies above Tokjok Islet, Pochon, Inje and Kojin. 
  Meanwhile, the South Korean puppets, instigated by the U.S. 
imperialists, staged war exercises against the North near the 
Demilitarized Zone of the Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. 
  On January 4 and 5, ground units of the South Korean puppet 
army fired large-calibre machine guns and automatic rifles in 
night attack exercises aimed at a breakthrough on the MDL in 
Inje, Paju, Chorwon and Yonchon Counties and large-calibre 
artillery units fired 50 odd shells into areas near the 
Demilitarized Zone and formations of helicopter gunboats and 
helicopter transports staged exercises of support to ground 
attack units and air-lifting of war supplies. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets must act 
with discretion, clearly mindful of the possible consequences of 
their war manoeuvrings against the northern half of Korea.

  [Text] A meeting took place at the DPRK Embassy to Russia 
on 5 January to explain the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's 
New Year address for this year. Senior officials and reporters 
of Russian newspapers and broadcasting stations were invited to 
the meeting. 
  Ambassador Son Song-pil spoke at the meeting. He said that 
during the New Year address, the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song summed up the brilliant achievements which the Korean 
people brought about in economic construction last year under 
the party's wise leadership and presented tasks for our party 
and people for the new year. 
  He pointed out that during the New Year address, the 
respected and beloved leader had given a programmatic teaching 
on the fatherland's reunification and declared that our nuclear 
issue which the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs are 
babbling about must be resolved only through DPRK-U.S. talks 
because it was raised when the United States brought nuclear 
weapons into South Korea. 
  He also stressed that the respected and beloved leader had 
said that pressure or threats will not resolve the nuclear 
issue, that pressure, threats, or so-called sanctions will not 
work on us, and that the United States must clearly see the 
reality and act with discretion.

people for their great achievements in socialist construction 
last year and wholeheartedly supported the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song's plan for the fatherland's reunification.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- World people and 
broad public circles have exposed the past crimes of Japan. 
  Participants of international meetings including the 
international hearing on sexual enslavement by the Japanese Army 
and the 49th session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights 
denounced the crimes of the Japanese imperialists in driving 
millions of Korean young and middle-aged people like beasts of 
burden and murdering over a million Korean people and making 
fortunes by carrying away a large amount of resources and 
valuable cultural relics. 
  At a meeting of the sub-commission on prevention of 
discrimination and protection of minorities, a representative of 
the Liberation Organization said that the Japanese imperialists 
had drafted over six million Korean young and middle-aged people 
to work them hard and its government and military deprived the 
Koreans of their language and names and forced them to worship 
the Japanese emperor. 
  Lourder Indai Sajor, coordinator of the Asian women human 
rights council task force for Filipino victims of military 
sexual slavery by Japan, said that the crimes of the Japanese 
imperialists in depriving women of their rights and reducing 
them to sexual slaves were most hideous anti-human, 
special-class crimes without parallel in history, that they were 
heinous crimes against human rights and humanity in view of 
international law. Campton Makamure, chairman of the Zimbabwe 
Association of Democratic Jurists, said that the Japanese 
imperialists established a medieval colonial rule after 
occupying Korea and murdered over a million Korean people in 
cold blood and drafted nearly 200,000 innocent Korean women as 
sexual slaves of the Japanese Army. 
  "If Japan really has the intention to improve its relations 
with the DPRK and contribute to world peace and security, it 
must repent of and apologize for its past crimes and show its 
sincerity in practice," he urged.

<F P=106> [Press statement by Kim Pyong-sik, vice president of the </F>
DPRK and chairman of the KSDP Central Committee, on 4 January; 
place not given--read by announcer] 
  [Text] Kim Pyong-sik, vice president of the DPRK and 
chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Socialist 
Democratic Party [KSDP], issued a press statement yesterday [4 
January] supporting the fatherland reunification formula 
clarified by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New 
Year's address. 
  The press statement by Kim Pyong-sik, vice president of the 
DPRK and chairman of the KSDP Central Committee, is as follows: 
  All KSDP members are filled with boundless excitement and 
swelling emotionAll KSDP members are filled with boundless 
excitement and swelling emotion on hearing the New Year, 1994, 
ushered in by the New Year address of the respected and beloved 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song, a peerless patriot and the sun of 
the nation. 
  The respected and beloved leader President Kim Il-song, in 
his New Year's address, proudly summed up last year's 
achievements of our people who gave full play to the indomitable 
spirit of chuche Korea by vigorously accelerating the socialist 
economic construction with revolutionary zeal and achieved 
successive triumphs in political, military confrontation with 
the imperialists and reactionaries. He also clarified the 
invariable principled stance of the government of our Republic 
regarding the fatherland's reunification and set forth 
programmatic tasks for making 1994 a year of historic upturn in 
our country's revolution and construction. 
  In the name of all the KSDP members, I extend warm support 
and welcome the respected and beloved comrade leader's historic 
New Year's address. 
  The respected and beloved leader President Kim Il-song has 
taught: For our people, reunifying the fatherland is the 
supreme task of our nation which must not be delayed. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, in his New Year's 
address, set efforts of the government of our Republic to pave a 
way for the fatherland's reunification on the united strength of 
the nation to counter the South Korean authorities' antinational 
acts which undermine such efforts. He also righteously pointed 
out that a so-called civilian regime in South Korea is only a 
disguise which does not differ from the successive military 
dictatorial regimes. 
  Out of the people's love of the country and desire to break 
the deadlock lying in the way of the country and the nation, and 
to explore a way for the nation, last year, the government of 
our Republic put forward a 10-point program of great unity for 
the whole nation for the fatherland's reunification and made all 
efforts to put it into effect. 
  The 10-point program set forth by the respected and beloved 
president is a great charter of the national unity and a bright 
patriotic torchlight for reunification aimed at ending the 
tragedy of separation and confrontation forced by outside forces 
and turning out all the compatriots in the North, South, and 
overseas to unite their strength to reunify the fatherland at an 
early date. The only way we can reunify the fatherland in the 
90's is thoroughly carrying out the 10-point program of great 
national unity. 
  Under conditions in which the newly-emerged South Korean 
regime professes itself to be a civilian regime, the government 
of our Republic hoped that they would take the road of 
reconciliation and cooperation in response to our 10-point 
program of great national unity, we also took important steps 
for an exchange of top-level special envoys between the two 
sides. 
  But the South Korean authorities, more wicked than their 
predecessors, have taken the path of depending on foreign forces 
and of confrontation between the North and South and ignoring 
our magnanimous proposal and the desire of the entire nation for 
reunification. 
  Contrary to their open declaration that any allied country 
could not be better than the nation and that they would promote 
the North- South relations proceeding from the point that we are 
the same fellow countrymen, they staged large-scale nuclear war 
exercises almost every day against their fellow countrymen in 
collusion with outside forces and drove the North-South 
relations to the worst situation on the pretext of North's 
nonexistent nuclear issue. 
  They left intact evil fascist laws, including the National 
Security Law which is a relic of the previous military fascist 
dictatorship, and the Agency for National Security Planning and 
the Defense Security command, which are suppressive agencies, 
thus brutally suppressing the righteous struggle of the South 
Korean people and students for independence, democracy, and 
reunification. 
  How can the Kim Yong-sam regime be called a civilian 
government and different from preceding military fascist regime 
when it did nothing but treachery, fascist and splittist acts, 
and North-South confrontation [taegyol] during its rule helped 
by outside force? 
  National independence is to love one's country and relying 
on 
outside force is to ruin one's country. The reason that our 
country is divided into two and that the tragedy of division is 
not ended are also because of the outside force. The outside 
force brought us not benefit but misery in the past. It is 
laying on us not mercy but pain today. 
  It is an intolerable antinational crime that the South 
Korean 
authorities keep refusing the fellow countrymen's offer to open 
a road for the nation to live on through reconciliation and 
cooperation between the North and South, and joining the outside 
force to aggravate North-South confrontation and intensify the 
tension. 
  Our nation should never choose to bring about 
self-destruction and let the outside force gain the profit by 
fighting with fellow countrymen under any circumstance. The 
road our nation should walk along is not the road of war due to 
hostility and confrontation but the road of reunification 
through national reconciliation and cooperation. 
  To a nation, independence is life. To defend the life, the 
whole nation should unite together. A nation not united cannot 
display its might, and a nation without might cannot keep its 
independence. If our nation achieves the great national unity 
with the pride of having kept a single nation for over 5,000 
years since Tangun, we can competently repulse any outside 
force's invasion or interference, break off [kkokko porigo] 
great powers' might, and achieve reunification in the nineties. 
  In his New Year's speech, the great leader pointed out that 
the Republic Government will make all its effort in the future 
to achieve the country's reunification in the form of the 
confederal system based on one nation, one country, two systems, 
and two governments, in accordance with the three major 
principles of independence, peaceful reunification, and great 
national unity. 
  If our nation, which has lived as a single nation during the 
long 5,000-year history, joins wisdom and might with national 
ideology, it could establish a pannational united country in the 
form of the confederal system for the North and South to coexist 
and co-prosper as we wish leaving two systems and two 
governments existing in the North and the South as they are. 
  All Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and overseas 
should come out and firmly unite as one under the banner of the 
10- point program of the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunificaiton of the country transcending the differences of 
idea and ideology, and political preference and religion, to 
establish a reunified country in the form of the confederal 
system. 
  In this year's New Year's speech, the respected and beloved 
leader President Kim Il-song also set forth the Republic 
Government's principled position that the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula should by all means be resolved through the 
DPRK-U.S. talks. The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula was 
originally raised not because of the suspicion over the North's 
nuclear development that the United States and its followers are 
talking about but because the United States brought in nuclear 
weapons to South Korea and threatened us with the weapons. 
  Therefore, the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should 
be resolved through the face-to-face negotiations between the 
United States which brought in nuclear weapons, and we, who are 
directly facing the threat. The United States should know that 
there is nothing to gain by clinging to suppression and threat. 
  As the respected and beloved president has taught, the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula should be resolved in 
conformity with the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. 
  The principled position on national reunification declared 
by 
the respected and beloved leader President Kim Il-song in his 
New Year's speech is indeed an inspiring banner for overcoming 
the difficulties faced by the nation and vigorously driving the 
whole nation to the great cause of reunification in the nineties. 
  All party members of our Korea Socialist Democratic Party of 
Korea, of which political ideology is the triad of men's 
independence, national independence, and mankind independence, 
shall make all their efforts to achieve the reunification in the 
nineties with great national unity highly upholding the New 
Year's speech of the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  Taking the opportunity, I firmly trust that all Korean 
compatriots in the North, the South and overseas will come out 
as one to the sacred cause of making this year as the historical 
year that opens a new phase of the national reunification highly 
upholding the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole 
nation for the reunificaiton of the country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- Factories and 
enterprises across the country are seething with a socialist 
emulation to overfulfill the national economic plans for this 
year. 
  Workers of the Hungnam fertilizer complex, the Chenam coal 
mine of the Pukchang District coal mining complex, the Sinuiju 
shoemaking factory and the Tongdaewon garment factory in 
Pyongyang express their determination to thoroughly implement 
the tasks set forth by the great leader President Kim Il-song in 
his New Year address and challenged the factories and 
enterprises of the same trades across the country to a socialist 
emulation. 
  This challenge has evoked response nationwide. 
  The workers of the Hungnam fertilizer complex vowed to 
increase the production of nitrogenous fertilizer 1.4 times and 
phosphate fertilizer 2.5 times compared with last year and are 
maintaining the full-capacity operation of modern equipment 
including the high-pressure compounding tanks and the 
compressors, keeping production on a high level. 
  The employees of the Chenam coal mine resolved to produce 
1.5 
times as much coal as last year by actively introducing 
effective cutting methods, while giving priority to tunnelling 
and pit concreting. 
  The workers of factories and enterprises all over the 
country 
including the Sinuiju shoemaking factory upheld the slogan "Let 
Us Accelerate Vigorously the General March of Socialism in the 
Revolutionary Spirit of Self-Reliance and Fortitude" and those 
of the Tongdaewon garment factory are resolved to fulfil ahead 
of schedule the export plan for this year which is 24 percent 
above last year.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The rural communities 
of Korea are now busy with farming preparations. 
  The agricultural working people throughout the country who 
reaped rare bumper crops last year are now concentrating their 
efforts on the production of compost, storage of water and 
repair and readjustment of tractors and other farm machines in 
order to have a bumper harvest again this year which will mark 
the 30th anniversary of the publication of the socialist rural 
theses (February 25, 1964.) 
  According to data available at the State Agricultural 
Commission, the compost production nationwide reached 84 percent 
of the plan as of January 5 and most of them has been carried 
out to paddy and non-paddy fields. 
  The agricultural working people in North Hamgyong Province 
and kaesong municipality have honored their compost production 
assignments respectively at 105 and 102 percent. 
  Rural communities including those in North Hwanghae and 
South 
Pyongan Provinces and Nampo municipality have stored water 
almost enough for this year's farming. 
  The repair and readjustment of tractors, rice-transplanting 
machines, rice seedling-plucking machines and other farm 
machines are near completion. 
  The adjustment of waterways and the check-up and repair of 
water-pumping facilities have made a substantial progress.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The Central People's 
Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 
January 5 issued a decree on the institution of the 
commemoration order of the 30th anniversary of the rural theses. 
  The decree says a change of the century has been effected in 
the rural communities of Korea over the past 30 years under the 
wise guidance of the party and the leader in the advance along 
the straight path indicated by "Theses on the Socialist Rural 
Question in our Country" published by the great leader President 
Kim Il-song on February 25, 1964. 
  "With the three revolutions, ideological, technical and 
cultural, powerfully accelerated in the rural communities," it 
notes, "our agricultural working people have become the true 
masters of the countryside enjoying an independent and creative 
life, freeing themselves from outdated ideas and customs left 
behind by the exploiter society, irrigation and electrification 
have been completed and comprehensive mechanization and 
application of chemicals have reached a high level and 
agricultural production has made a fast progress on the basis of 
modern science and technology through the application of the 
chuche method of farming. 
  "The Central People's Committee of the DPRK adopts a 
decision 
on the institution of the commemoration order of the 30th 
anniversary of the rural theses for the state decoration of 
officials and agricultural working people who have performed 
distinguished feats in the fruitful efforts to carry the 
socialist rural theses into practice, sincerely following the 
wise guidance of the party and the leader," says the decree.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- Many people have 
become performers of feats and heroes of the time in the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  Last year, 135 people were awarded the title of hero for 
their unexcelled self-sacrificing spirit, patriotic devotion and 
creative activity for the country and the people, for the 
society and collective. 
  Among them are heroes of the Republic Hwang Yong-chun and Yu 
Kyong-nam and labor heroes Kwon Sun-hui, Yi Ung-su and Yi 
Sung-ha. 
  Yi In-mo, a former war correspondent of the Korean People's 
Army, who underwent unspeakable sufferings behind bars in South 
Korea for 34 years, maintaining his patriotic principle, was 
embraced by the great homeland last year and awarded the gold 
star medal of the hero of the Republic amid blessings of all the 
people. 
  Hwang Yong-chun rendered distinguished service in defending 
the country, while serving as a soldier until he was 37 years 
old though he received demobilization orders six times. Yu 
Kyong-nam died at the age of 22 while serving in the Army. He 
saved scores of his comrades by covering with his body a 
handgrenade on the point of explosion. 
  Among the heroes are those who distinguished themselves in 
socialist economic construction, effected innovations in 
production and contributed to the development of the nation's 
science, education and literature and art. 
  It is unthinkable apart from the noblest benevolent politics 
of the illustrious leader that a good many people have become 
heroes while defending socialism. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il published a historic 
work "Let us All Live and Struggle Like Heroes" in May 1988. In 
the work he said that to live like a hero and to become a hero 
is the only valuable and worthy life for a [word indistinct] man 
and encouraged all the people to perform heroic feats. 
  Thus heroism of the Korean people that originated from the 
anti- Japanese revolutionary struggle is being given a fuller 
scope in grand socialist construction today after years of the 
arduous yet worthwhile revolution. 
  Mass heroism and unexcelled devotion have been fully 
displayed in all sectors of the national economy, producing many 
heroes of the Republic and labor heroes every year. 
  Heroes in the Army and among the people remain loyal to the 
leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great brilliant commander. 
This is the true appearance of the Korean society.

<F P=106> ["Imperialists' Anti-Socialist Moves Bound To Go </F>
Busted"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song, analysing the present international 
situation in his New Year address, clarified that the 
imperialists are blustering, but they can neither arrest the 
people's aspiration to socialism nor turn back the trend of 
history. 
  The idea of inevitability of the frustration of the 
imperialists' anti-socialist moves and necessity of the victory 
of socialism, which was elucidated by the great leader in his 
New Year address, serves as an inspiring banner in smashing the 
manoeuvres of the imperialists and vigorously struggling for the 
accomplishment of the socialist cause, NODONG SINMUN today in a 
by-lined article says, and goes on: 
  As in the past, so in the future, too, the anti-socialist 
moves of the imperialists are bound to go bankrupt. This is 
because the old cannot defeat the new, first of all. 
  The imperialists' moves to arrest the development of 
socialism and obliterate it are an anti-historic scheme contrary 
to the law governing historic development and, accordingly, it 
is axiomatic that it cannot be realized. 
  In view of the course of the development of human history, 
capitalism, the old one going against historic development, is 
bound to give way to an advanced socialism as a slave society 
gave way to a feudal society and the latter to a capitalist 
society. 
  The moves of the imperialists to block the development of 
socialism and stifle it cannot but meet a strong counter-attack 
of the popular masses as they are anti-popular and against 
history. 
  The struggle for socialism is the cause to realise the 
aspirations and demand of the popular masses to live and develop 
independently as full-fledged masters of the state and society 
freed from all manner of exploitation and oppression. 
  The plot of the imperialists to block the development of 
socialism and restore capitalism is bound to fail in face of the 
rejection and protest of the popular masses. 
  The more viciously the imperialists pursue anti-socialist 
strategy, the more vigorously the popular masses will struggle 
against them, strengthening unity and solidarity. 
  Socialism is sure to win victory in the struggle against 
capitalism thanks to the active support and struggle of the 
popular masses. It is because socialism, an idea conforming 
with the independent nature of the popular masses and the 
requirement of social development, is daily growing in strength 
with the positive support of the popular masses who are an 
overwhelming majority of society.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The policy of opening 
a new phase of national reunification through the unity of the 
whole nation which was clarified by the great leader President 
Kim Il-song in his New Year address for 1994 indicates the most 
reasonable and realistic way to realize the reunification of the 
country by the internal efforts of the nation in conformity with 
the will and interests of the nation, said Yom Tae-chun, 
presidium member of the Central Committee of the Democratic 
Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland (DFRF), in a 
statement January 6. 
  He pointed out that the DPRK made every possible effort to 
achieve a great unity of the whole nation last year, but the 
South Korean authorities, ignoring it, took the road of 
dependence on foreign forces, the road of North-South 
confrontation. 
  He said the Kim Yong-sam group's criminal acts clearly prove 
that it is a pack of despicable traitors who are clean 
indifferent to the destiny of the nation, only seeking to 
maintain their power, and that it is impossible to achieve 
national reconciliation and unity, peace and peaceful 
reunification of the country while Kim Yong-sam's "regime" is 
left intact. 
  He stressed that all the people who love the country and the 
nation should unite as the same nation in hearty response to the 
"10-point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for 
the Reunification of the Country", the great charter of national 
unity, transcending all differences, whether they be in the 
North, or in the South, or abroad and whether they be 
communists, or nationalists, haves, or have-nots, and pave the 
path to national reunification together.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- Chong Sin-hyok, 
vice-chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of 
the Fatherland, in a statement January 6 said that to found a 
pan-national unified state through a confederacy on the basis of 
the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and 
great national unity as clarified by the great leader President 
Kim Il-song in his New Year address for 1994 is the most fair 
and feasible way of reunification which fully conforms to the 
will and interests of the nation. 
  "If our nation who has lived as a homogeneous one for more 
than 5,000 years from the days of Tangun unites firmly as one 
under the banner of the 10-point programme of the great unity of 
the whole nation, transcending differences in ideology and idea, 
political view and religious belief, it can found the 
pan-national unified state without difficulty while leaving the 
two systems and two governments existing in the North and South 
as they are," he said, and stressed: 
  "The present South Korean authorities, however, broke off 
all 
the dialogues of both governmental and nongovernmental level 
between the North and South which had been held even in the days 
of the preceding military fascist 'regimes', saying they 'cannot 
shake hands with the partner possessed of nuclear weapons', and 
did not hesitate to commit such a treacherous act as trampling 
upon the historical North-South agreement and joint declaration 
on denuclearization which had already been adopted and brought 
into effect, like sheets of waste paper. 
  "What our nation wants is national reconciliation and unity, 
not confrontation and war. 
  "All the Koreans in the North, in the South and abroad 
should 
turn out more vigorously in the struggle for national 
reunification."

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- The construction of 
reservoirs has been pushed ahead in Korea. 
  Some 20 reservoirs are under construction in North Hwanghae 
Province, western central part of the country. 
  Their pondage amounts to tens of millions of cubic meters. 
  The builders are now speeding up the construction of 
reservoirs at the final stage with a target to finish them 
before the 30th anniversary of the publication of the rural 
theses (February 25). 
  The province built the Chitaek reservoir with a pondage of 2 
million cubic metres, the Sinchon reservoir with a pondage of 
1.7 million cubic metres and 30 other reservoirs in the last two 
years for an effective use in the development of agriculture. 
  The work to consolidate irrigation is being pushed ahead in 
other provinces including South Hwanghae, North and South 
Pyongan Provinces. 
  In Korea, all paddy and non-paddy fields have been already 
fully irrigated. 
  The overall irrigation system for paddy and non-paddy fields 
has been established with the construction of 14,000 kilometres 
of water channels including the West Sea 
barrage-Sinchon-Kangryong-Ongjin waterway, the West Sea 
barrage-Lake Changsu reverse current waterway, the West Sea 
barrage-Onchon waterway, the River Yesong-Yonbaek plain 
waterway, the River Nam-Miru plain waterway, the Taechon power 
station-Unjon-Chongju-Kwaksan waterway, over 12,400 pumping 
stations, 192 reservoirs and over 16,000 underground water 
facilities along with the existing irrigation set-ups.

  [Text] Berlin, Jan. 6 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has not sent 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) any message 
signalling its acceptance of IAEA inspections of its nuclear 
sites, IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said Thursday [6 January]. 
  The Vienna-based IAEA is waiting for Pyongyang to provide an 
official message signed by Atomic Energy Industry Minister Choe 
Hak-kun for any kind of breakthrough in the situation in view of 
past negotiations with the communist regime, Meyer said. 
  There has not been any message from Pyongyang since 
unofficial contact between working-level officials from each 
side on Wednesday [5 January], he said. But IAEA expects North 
Korean response regarding nuclear inspections soon and will 
continue to be on the alert this weekend, he added.

  [Text] Panmunjom, Korea, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- It is not in 
the interest of any nation to see North Korea collapse and it is 
dangerous to push Pyongyang hard on the nuclear issue, Maj. 
Gen. Bernard Sandoz, chief Swiss member on the Neutral Nations 
Supervisory Commission (NNSC), said Friday [7 January]. 
  "There is danger of pushing North Korea and having something 
that no one wants to have," he said in an exclusive interview 
with YONHAP. "Be patient," Sandoz, asked about prospects of 
Korean reunification, told YONHAP reporters at the Swiss Club 
inside the truce village of Panmunjom. 
  "It is not in the interest of South Korea, China, Japan or 
the United States to have collapse of North Korea," he said, 
warning of tremendous repercussions. While hailing the progress 
in Pyongyang-Washington dialogue in solving the nuclear 
situation, the major general noted that North Korea basically 
has "no confidence in Americans." 
  North Korea claims it has come close to meeting U.S. terms 
only to see Washington move away by attaching more conditions to 
better relations, and so North Korea is demanding a package deal 
to resolve the nuclear question, he said. 
  "Yongbyon is the only card in their (North Korean) game," he 
said, referring to the site of suspected nuclear facilities 
involved in secretive arms development. U.S. concern for peace 
and stability in Northeast Asia is well understood, Sandoz said. 
  "It's important for North Korea to have something where they 
know they will not be cheated." 
  The 58-year-old general, a diplomat by profession, has been 
at his post since August 1990 and witnessed changes in 
inter-Korean relations and the status of the commission, 
established in 1953 at the end of a three-year Korean war to 
oversee the Armistice Agreement. All official contact between 
North Korea and the NNSC was broken off in May 1991 by 
Pyongyang, a result of North Korea's protest against the 
appointment of the first South Korean chief of the Military 
Armistice Commission in March that year. 
  "It's very frustrating to be here and not be able to fulfill 
the mission completely because of the boycott," he told YONHAP. 
He said they had to accept other channels of dialogue such as 
the ongoing working-level talks between North Korea and the 
United States in New York. 
  Despite North Korea's insistence on dissolving the NNSC, 
Sandoz said, the commission will stay until the Armistice 
Agreement is replaced by a peace treaty. 
  The Armistice Agreement is the only legal base, he said, and 
the NNSC is part of this legal base. 
  "We will stay until both sides (South and North Korea) agree 
we should leave," he said. "This is the official position of the 
NNSC and members' governments."

<F P=106> [Report by Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Panmunjom, Korea, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- Inter-Korean 
relations have changed dramatically during the last 40 years, 
and so have the role, status and responsibilities of everything 
that is related to them. 
  Just ask Maj. Gen. Bernard Sandoz, chief Swiss member on 
the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), who is three 
years and five months into an assigment that secludes him in 
barracks in the middle of no-man's land in the truce village of 
Panmunjom on the dividing line between South and North Korea. 
  "We have to accept other channels of dialogue. They (South 
and North Korea, the United Nations Command [UNC]) don't need us 
so much," Sandoz tells reporters from YONHAP, the first Korean 
journalists to meet him inside the Swiss barracks. The 
commission was powerful when it was formed at the end of the 
1950-1953 Korean war. 
  Purpose -- to supervise, investigate and control so that 
neither side of Korea will increase military tension in 
violation of the Armistice Agreement signed at the end of the 
war. 
  Members -- Czechoslovakia and Poland picked by North Korea, 
and Sweden and Switzerland chosen by South Korea. 
  It had five inspection teams in both halves of Korea to 
check 
every ingoing and outgoing ship, aircraft and train to prevent 
arms smuggling and espionage. 
  "In 1954, 1955, 1956, there were no discussions (between 
South and North Korea)," Sandoz recalls. "We were the only ones 
to be able to cross the border freely. We would tell each other 
what the other thinks. 
  "The main job was to make contact, make them understand the 
viewpoint of the neighbor." 
  It was the NNSC that persuaded South and North Korea to sit 
down for informal, secret talks at the outbreak of the Pueblo 
incident in 1968, when North Korea captured a U.S. spy boat and 
its crew. 
  It was in the NNSC lounge that the two Koreas held sports 
and 
students talks, and here that they exchanged the agreement on a 
non- nuclear Korean peninsula. 
  "This is proof that it (NNSC) is still useful," says Sandoz. 
But NNSC history tells of numerous ups and downs. 
Demonstrators opposing the Armistice Agreement rallied against 
the commission and some people even sent bombs to its barracks. 
All inspection teams were recalled, and staff drastically 
reduced from 96 to about 10 at the Swiss commission. 
  Recent years saw more disappointments. Czechoslovakia left 
the commission after North Korea insisted that its breakup into 
separate states had invalidated its status. 
  The seat has remained vacant since April 10, 1993. North 
Korea is yet to name a successor since it "found no one who can 
give the assurance they will be neutral," according to Sandoz. 
  North Korea refused to recognize the appointment of the 
first 
South Korean as chief of the UNC side of the Military Armistice 
Commission in March 1991, and the next May, when the NNSC chose 
to remain neutral and not pressure the UNC to revoke the 
appointment, North Korea cut off all official contact with the 
commission. 
  "It's very frustrating to be here and not be able to fulfill 
our mission completely because of the boycott," the 58-year-old 
general tells the YONHAP reporters. 
  There are limitations to how much the commission can do 
right 
now because North Korea insists on talking only with the United 
States. 
  "The NNSC is at any time willing to mediate, but the problem 
is both sides have interest to negotiate directly, North Korea 
directly with the United States, South Korea directly with North 
Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) directly 
with North Korea without any intermediary," he explains. 
  Sandoz travels to Pyongyang and other North Korean cities 
every few months at unofficial invitation from his counterparts 
there and China, a signatory of the Korean Armistice Agreement. 
He was invited to Pyongyang for President Kim Il-song's 80th 
birthday celebration in April 1992 and went through North Korea 
last year on his way to and back from Tibet and China. 
  There is no telling when Sandoz will return to his home 
country and resume his diplomatic career. The post is for three 
years, but his stay in Panmunjom was extended at the lack of a 
successor. But he is sure about one thing, that NNSC has to 
stay until the Korean Armistice Agreement is replaced by a peace 
regime. 
  "We believe strongly we are still useful because we are part 
of the Armistice Agreement, the only legal base," he says. 
North Korea wants the commission dissolved, but South Korea and 
the UNC say otherwise. 
  "As long as they have different views, we stay. This is the 
official position of NNSC and the members' governments," Sandoz 
says.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- The presidents of South 
and North Korea exchanged envoys in autumn 1985 as they sought 
to set up a summit, the CHUNGANG Daily News reported Friday. 
  President Chon Tu-hwan sent director of the Agency for 
National Security Planning [NSP] Chang Se-tong to Pyongyang 
after Ho Tam, secretary of the North Korean Workers' (Communist) 
Party, visited Seoul as the special envoy of President Kim 
Il-song, the daily claimed in its story. Ho arrived in Seoul on 
Sept. 4 through the truce village of Panmunjom and stayed until 
Sept. 6, while Chang visited Pyongyang through Panmunjom from 
Oct. 16 until Oct. 18, it said. 
  The presidents discussed through their envoys how to arrange 
the first Seoul-Pyongyang summit. 
  Pak Chol-on, as special assistant to the NSP director, went 
with Chang to Pyongyang while Ho was accompanied by Han Si-hae, 
An Pyong-su and Choe Pong-chun. Ho was chairman of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Fatherland, which is 
in charge of North Korean policy toward the South, from 1984 
until his death in 1991. 
  Chang met with Kim Il-song on Oct. 17 in Pyongyang and gave 
him a letter from Chon asking him to visit Seoul after Chon 
visited Pyongyang, the CHUNGANG said. 
  The two sides discussed ways to hold a summit in Pyongyang 
at 
"an early date" and a second summit in Seoul, but the meeting 
has still to be realized nearly 10 years later. 
  North Korea was more active than the South in seeking a 
summit until the end of 1985, but become reluctant in 1986 as 
the South Korean political situation became unstable due to 
controversy over constitutional revision.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Control Mechanism Is Needed in Dealing With </F>
the Policy Toward North Korea"] 
  [Text] In his New Year's address, asserting that "the 
nuclear issue should be solved only through DPRK-U.S. talks," 
North Korean President Kim Il-song denounced President Kim 
Yong-sam's civilian government by saying it is "a puppet regime 
which is no different from the previous military dictatorial 
regimes." 
  All North Korean mass media, including NODONG SINMUN as 
well, 
have been denouncing the Kim Yong-sam government, calling it "a 
puppet clique." This shows that Kim Il-song and his regime still 
do not recognize our legitimate civilian-led government as a 
party of dialogue while still adhering to the Cold War theory. 
  This notwithstanding, our side tends to assess North Korea 
with good-intended words by saying "We cannot say North Korea 
possesses nuclear weapons," "It is an urgent task to solve the 
North Korean nuclear issue in the first half of this year," and 
"It is possible to hold North-South summit talks this year." 
Thus, a series of encouraging words that pin hopes on North 
Korea as being one party of the North-South dialogue have been 
successively uttered recently. 
  What a contradictory phenomenon this is! It results from the 
fact that confronting views in approaching the North-South 
Korean issue have long existed in our society, and even today a 
view which synthetically grasps the North-South Korean issue has 
not been yet established among our people. Furthermore, such a 
series of words may have been uttered after being perplexed by 
the fact that an agreement is imminent in the negotiations 
between the United States and North Korea. 
  Although such conflicting views on North-South relations 
among our government officials have been rectified to some 
extent following the recent cabinet reshuffle, many of those who 
deal with the North-South relations question still only reveal a 
"good opinion" regarding their personal stance or the stance of 
the organization they belong to. 
  Anyway, in dealing with the issue of North-South relations 
we 
tends to overlook the essence of the issue and, instead, only 
cling to procedures, giving priority to them. For example, we 
have even come to believe that if North Korea accepts nuclear 
inspections and agrees to exchange special envoys, the issue of 
North-South relations can be completely settled. The nuclear 
inspections are nothing but a process to guarantee North Korea's 
transparency, which can prove that it is not developing nuclear 
weapons. North Korea's nuclear transparency is not guaranteed to 
the extent where we can promise to suspend the Team Spirit 
exercise as soon as the International Atomic Energy Agency's 
inspection team arrives in North Korea. 
  Speaking of the issue of exchanging special envoys, 
exchanging special envoys itself is not important. What is 
important is the contents of the messages the special envoys 
deliver. The contents of the messages exchanged between the 
North and the South may differ. It will require much time and 
effort before the North and the South reach an agreement in view 
on the contents included in the messages. 
  We should examine if we have been entangled in North Korea's 
strategy intended to overshadow the essence of North-South 
relations. At the same time, we should establish a sort of 
mechanism which can deal with the issue of North-South relations 
by giving emphasis to its essence. We should develop a policy 
toward North Korea which has principles and continuity. A policy 
toward North Korea should be such that it does not change even 
if a regime or ministers concerned change. It should transcend 
the regime. Such a policy is possible only when it is 
implemented with the spirit that the issue of North-South 
relations should be dealt with by the ROK, not by specific 
ministries or regimes.

<F P=106> ["Special interview" with Vice Unification Minister Song </F>
Yong-tae by Kim Kyo-man; place and date not given--first 
paragraph is MUNHWA ILBO introduction] 
  [Text] We are curious to know how inter-Korean relations, 
which were at a stalemate over the nuclear issue during the 
entire past year of 1993, will develop in the new year. Vice 
Unification Minister Song Yong-tae, examining the prospects for 
inter-Korean relations in 1994, said, "A momentous turning point 
will come about. The government will establish a new attitude 
in its reunification policy." The following is the government's 
reunification policy as disclosed by Vice Minister Song during 
an interview with MUNHWA ILBO. 
  [Kim] What is the direction of the government's 
reunification policy for the new year in order to resolve the 
stalemate in inter-Korean relations? 
  [Song] A momentous turning point will come about this year 
for the progress of inter-Korean relations. Therefore, our 
reunification policy will establish new features both in 
domestic policy and in the policy toward the North. Internally, 
we will develop a picture of the reunified fatherland and induce 
national consensus. The reunified fatherland will be a state 
where freedom, human rights, and welfare are embodied and where 
law and morality prevail. For this, the features of the 
reunified state should be embodied within South Korea in the 
first place. This is why our country's reform process must 
succeed. Reform is a prerequisite for reunification. 
  In our policy toward the North, we will strive so that the 
nuclear issue can be resolved and inter-Korean relations can 
enter the stage of reconciliation and cooperation. We will do 
our utmost so that the working delegates' contact for the 
exchange of special envoys, which was suspended last year, may 
be resumed as soon as possible. 
  [Kim] In connection with our policy on the North Korean 
nuclear issue, the most controversial point was the policy of 
linking the nuclear issue with economic cooperation. Will you 
continue to maintain this policy? 
  [Song] Since the nuclear issue is directly connected with 
our 
nation's survival, the highest precedence should be given to 
resolving it. As long as the nuclear issue remains unresolved, 
practical progress in inter-Korean relations is improbable. It 
was in this perspective that we linked the nuclear issue with 
economic cooperation. Therefore, we will maintain this policy. 
I think that our policy of linking the nuclear issue with 
economic cooperation demonstrated to the international community 
our determination to resolve the nuclear issue and contributed 
to strengthening the international cooperation system. 
  [Kim] One of our main concerns this year is the issue of 
exchanging special envoys. If the exchange of special envoys is 
realized, what issues will be discussed there? 
  [Song] There are differences between the two sides over the 
mission of the envoys exchanged. We think the special envoy 
would be a messenger who would convey the will of the top 
leaders of each side. The North side assigns the special envoy 
the role of discussing the pending issues between the North and 
the South, such as the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, 
alleviation of tensions, the implementation of the North-South 
Agreement, the great national unity, and the North-South summit 
talks. 
  To narrow this difference, we will have to have working 
contacts, but our position in exchanging special envoys is that 
the highest precedence must be given to resolving the nuclear 
issue. North Korea also mentioned the nuclear issue when it 
proposed the exchange of special envoys. The North shares our 
position in the sense that it put forth the issue of 
denuclearization at the top of the agenda. On all accounts, the 
main point in the agenda in the exchange of special envoys is to 
bring a breakthrough in resolving the nuclear issue. 
  [Kim] North Korea-U.S. negotiations to find a solution to 
the North Korea nuclear issue are currently underway. What is 
your view? 
  [Song] Since negotiations are underway, it is not easy to 
have concrete prospects at present. However, it is clear that 
the two nations do not want a catastrophe to result if the 
negotiations fail. I think that the possibility of resolving the 
North Korean nuclear issue is greater than ever before. 
  [Kim] What is the part to be changed above all in the 
government's policy on North Korea in the event that the North 
Korea-U.S. negotiations are concluded successfully? 
  [Song] The expected result in the current negotiations would 
be a complete return of North Korea to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty and acceptance of inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. However, our position is 
that mutual inspections between the North and South should 
follow. In the event that agreement is reached on the mutual 
inspections and those inspections are carried out, our 
government will allow businessmen to visit the North and will 
initiate full-scale economic cooperation. 
  We will also pay attention to joint development of 
resources, 
including nuclear energy. This will not only result in the 
exchange of manpower and materials between the North and the 
South but also will effect unprecedented changes in overall 
North-South relations. 
  In addition, in the event that North Korea accepts all of 
the 
ordinary and ad hoc inspections by the IAEA and responds to the 
exchange of special envoys of the North and the South, the issue 
of suspending the 1994 Team Spirit exercise will be decided 
under our government's authority. The issue of turning the 
Armistice Agreement into a peace agreement, which is closely 
related to consolidation of peace on the Korean peninsula, is 
clearly prescribed in the basic agreement. Therefore, we will 
make efforts to resolve this issue with the initiative. 
  [Kim] What were the noteworthy changes, if any, in North 
Korea's movement and attitude last year? 
  [Song] In the political field, North Korea has been 
reinforcing Secretary Kim Chong-il's system. In view of the 
fact that North Korea admitted the failure of the Third Economic 
Plan, we estimate that the North Korean economy is in a serious 
situation. In the social field, the phenomenon of deviation 
[iltal] has persisted despite the authorities' control. Even 
amid the difficult economic situation, North Korea pushed ahead 
with the expansion of armaments. 
  We can say that its overall internal situation is getting 
worse. However, it is true that North Korea is seeking a series 
of changes in a bid to maintain existing systems. For example, 
the Supreme People's Assembly held last December declared 
agriculture-first, trade-first, and light industry-first policy. 
Besides, North Korea is accelerating the overhaul of its 
juridical system with a view to inducing foreign investment. 
  [Kim] You mentioned changes in North Korea. What is your 
view 
on the degree of such changes? 
  [Song] It is true that North Korea is changing. But it is 
too 
early to consider this as an essential change. I would like to 
personally describe it as tactical change. However, we should 
also remember that when such tactical change is accumulated, 
this change will be linked to strategic change. 
  One of the examples is that North Korea entered the United 
Nations together with South Korea. Up until its entrance to the 
United Nations, North Korea claimed that simultaneous entry was 
a policy for the perpetuation of division. Nevertheless, it 
choose the simultaneous entry in order to maintain its system 
after the international situation changed. In view of North 
Korea's past logic, this can be considered a great change. 
  Likewise, North Korea will continue to seek changes 
according 
to what occurs at home and abroad for the survival of its own 
system. I think the direction of changes North Korea is seeking 
would be that of Chinese-style change. I presume that even if 
North Korea pursues the Chinese model, it will take its own 
characteristics into account and will push for a limited opening 
at a lower speed than that of China. 
  [Kim] People repeatedly say that circumstances for 
reunification have now changed. Will you point out which are 
beneficial to reunification and which are not in recent 
relations among neighboring countries? 
  [Song] The neighboring countries of the Korean peninsula 
support the principle of resolving the reunification issue by 
the concerned parties, North and South of Korea, as well as the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The fact that our 
neighboring countries want the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula and durable peace are aspects beneficial to us, 
because the basis of our reunification policy is to advance 
toward reunification through the peaceful coexistence between 
the North and the South. Therefore, North and South of Korea 
should take advantage of this opportunity, and should gather 
wisdom so that they can ultimately advance toward reunification 
by consolidating durable peace and through peaceful coexistence. 
  Regarding the effort to consolidate peace on the Korean 
peninsula, we are somewhat worried about the indication given by 
some neighboring countries increasing their military power. The 
movements of Japan and China belong to this category. I think we 
should take precautions for the possibility of such movements 
advancing to such a degree as to threaten stability and peace in 
Northeast Asia. 
  [Kim] It is expected that Japan, which kept step with the 
United States, will accelerate the speed of contacting North 
Korea this year. People pointed out that we should also deal 
with this. 
  [Song] We understand that the Japanese Government will 
initiate a full-scale negotiation with North Korea for the 
establishment of diplomatic relations only after the nuclear 
problem is solved. The United States, Japan, and we are keeping 
the step with one another under a close cooperative system. This 
relationship will continue in the future, too. 
  The visits of Japanese businessmen to North Korea do not 
necessary mean that they are going to start economic cooperation 
with North Korea at once. Such visits are made in order to make 
an advance survey of North Korea with the purpose of preparing 
for compensation to be paid to North Korea by Japan after the 
establishment of diplomatic relations. 
  [Kim] What are the tasks that should be pushed ahead by 
North 
and South Korea as short-range projects to prepare for 
reunification? 
  [Song] The top priority task is the issue of separated 
families. This issue stands above any political issue. The North 
and South reached an agreement in 1992 on the visit of old 
parents to their hometown. The work of establishing a meeting 
site for separated families in Panmunjom and exchanging 
home-visiting groups and letters should be pushed ahead without 
any precondition. Two years have passed since the basic 
agreement, which the North and the South pledged before 70 
million fellow countrymen, was adopted. We should make efforts 
so that the work of various joint committees is resumed at an 
early date to implement the agreement.

  [Text] It was learned on 6 January that North-South trade 
was reduced last year for the first time since the guideline on 
North-South trade and cooperation was formulated in June 1989. 
  That day, the National Unification Board [NUB] revealed that 
the volume of the government-approved North-South trade for 1993 
indicates $190.49 million of import and $10.228 million of 
export, thus amounting to a total of $206.647 million. This 
figure shows six percent decrease from the amount of previous 
year of $231.503 million. 
  The NUB observed that the reduction of North-South trade, 
which showed the increase each year, is prompted by strained 
North-South relations since North Korea withdrew from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The NUB, however, revealed that 
the trade of last December amounted to $40.304 million in 64 
cases, showing 8.9 percent increase from the previous month. 
  In particular, the actual trade amount approved by the 
government on processing-for-wage deals was $4.338 million in 43 
cases last year, showing an increase by a factor of 7.8 over the 
$556,000 in 10 cases in the previous year. The NUB official 
noted that this increase indicates a new possibility for 
North-South trade.

  [Text] Concerning the recent views that the international 
community should impose strong economic sanctions on North Korea 
in case there is a brake in the consultations between the North 
Korean side and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on 
nuclear inspections--including U.S.-North Korean negotiations 
regarding the nuclear issue, which have been in going on 
recently--Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev warned on 5 
January that this step would make North Korea withdraw from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. 
  In a meeting with U.S. congressmen visiting Russia on that 
same day, Defense Minister Grachev said that Russia wants North 
Korea to return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and that 
it does not want the DPRK to be isolated from the international 
community. 
  He stressed that the United States must urge China to show a 
more active and correct attitude toward the settlement of the 
nuclear issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- Japan proposed to North 
Korea last autumn that they resume their negotiations on 
normalization of diplomatic relations, suspended in November 
1992, a senior official at the Foreign Ministry said Thursday [6 
January]. 
  "We proposed holding preparatory negotiations," he said. 
  This is a reversal of the Japanese Government position that 
it would not propose resumption of negotiations because North 
Korea one-sidedly broke them off. Tokyo seems to have changed 
its position and made the proposition because it was felt that 
postponing resumption of the negotiations recklessly was 
undesirable in view of a possible breakthrough in nuclear 
negotiations between North Korea and the United States, 
according to diplomatic sources. 
  "Last autumn, a Foreign Ministry official officially asked 
North Korean authorities stationed in a third country to have 
preparatory negotiations with Japan for resumption of talks on 
normalization of diplomatic ties," the Ministry official said. 
North Korea has not answered Tokyo's proposition, he said. 
Japan made the proposal as indirect aid to the United States in 
its negotiations with North Korea on the nuclear problem, he 
said. 
  "The Foreign Ministry could tap North Korea's position on 
the 
preparatory negotiations again if necessary," he said. 
  He had no comment on the results of North Korean-U.S. 
contacts announced Thursday. 
  "It's too early to say anything about the negotiation," he 
said. Blocking special inspections of North Korea's 
non-declared nuclear facilities would affect the resumption of 
Tokyo-Pyongyang negotiations, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Japan will 
send a joint mission to Sakhalin on Jan. 10 to investigate the 
living conditions of ethnic Koreans there, the Foreign Ministry 
said Friday [7 January]. Most ethnic Koreans there were 
mobilized by Japan as miners during World War II and left behind 
after the war, when Russia seized the territory. 
  The joint team will conduct a basic survey on living 
conditions and demands of the Koreans and will seek cooperation 
with the Sakhalin local government and Red Cross for four days. 
Seoul considers the issue of returning the Koreans a symbolic 
work to resolve wrongdoings by Tokyo in the early 20th century. 
  "Most Koreans who want to return to Korea are those who went 
there during World War II and now are aging. So we are to seek 
an early solution to the issue," a Foreign Ministry official 
said. 
  The South Korean delegation, headed by Sin Kak-su, chief of 
the Northeast Asia division of the Foreign Ministry, include 
officials from the prime minister's office, Health and Social 
Affairs Ministry and Korea National Red Cross, while the 
Japanese team will comprise Foreign Ministry and Red Cross 
officials. 
  Russia will send observers from the Foreign Ministry and 
State Committee on National Problems.

  [Text] Korea has been given observer status by the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to 
its committee on capital movements and invisible transactions 
(CMIT), the Foreign Ministry said yesterday [6 January]. The 
CMIT is one of five finance-related OECD committees whose 
observer status Korea requested in July last year as a step to 
becoming a full member of the body composed of 24 advanced 
economies in 1996. 
  A ministry official said that the Paris-based OECD is 
expected to allow Korea observer status to the remaining four 
committees soon. 
  The four are the committee on international investment and 
multinational enterprises (CIME), the insurance committee, the 
committee on financial markets and the committee on fiscal 
affairs. 
  The gaining of observer status to the CMIT, a key move for a 
country seeking to join the OECD, is expected to promote 
internationalization of Korea's financial and capital sectors, 
the official said. 
  Now, Mexico, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are 
active as observers to the CMIT. 
  The OECD has a total of 26 committees and four organs, of 
which Korea is a regular member or observer to 10.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- Korean-French arms dealer 
Jean-Rene Fuan and his Seoul agent, Chu Kwang-yong, conspired to 
cheat the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) out of 6.7 million U.S. 
dollars between 1991 and last year, the joint 
military-prosecution team investigating the fraud announced 
Friday, winding up its two-week probe. The team will shortly 
ask the Korean Embassy in Paris to file a formal accusation of 
fraud against Fuan with the French Government but will suspend 
the filing of formal charges against Chu as he went abroad just 
before the case surfaced in mid-December. 
  For their negligence, which resulted in no action in spite 
of 
the non-arrival of 90mm recoilless rifle ammunition one year and 
seven months after payment was made and in no steps to prevent 
Chu's flight from the country, disciplinary action will be taken 
against former and incumbent DLA directors, the announcement 
said. 
  Four DLA officials involved in the scam have been arrested 
on 
charges of neglect of duty, forgery of documents and taking 
bribes. They are Army Col. Yun Sam-song, Navy Capt. To 
Chong-il, and civilian employees Hong Kol-hui and Yi Myong-ku. 
  Yang Kyu-sok, operating officer of United Shipping Co., was 
arrested for having forged a bill of lading for Chu and Fuan to 
withdraw the payment for the non-existent shells from the Korea 
Exchange Bank's Paris Branch. 
  Of the 6.7 million dollars they swindled out of the DLA, 
just 
630,000 dollars was found in Chu's bank accounts in Seoul, the 
announcement said. 
  As the investigation is complete, the Defense Ministry will 
reform the defense procurement system by the end of June to 
strengthen the function of foreign procurement and transfer as 
many domestic procurements as possible to the office of supply. 
  In addition, the Ministry will lay legal grounds for 
strictly 
punishing arms dealers who break a contract.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry on 
Friday fired Lt. Gen. Yi Su-ik as director of the Defense 
Logistics Agency (DLA) effective Saturday in connection with its 
investigation of a scandal involving false purchases of 
artillery ammunition. The Ministry immediately named Maj. Gen. 
Yim Sam, Chief of Staff of the ROK Army Logistic Command, to 
replace Yi. 
  The joint military and civilian prosecution team 
investigating the fraud announced Friday that it was perpetrated 
by French arms dealer Jean-Rene Fuan and a Korean intermediary, 
Chu Kwang-yong. 
  Fuan, 53, and Chu, 52, who fled the country shortly before 
the start of the investigation, defrauded the Defense Ministry 
of 5.3 billion won using forged documents, the prosecution team 
said. 
  In a related development, the Ministry said that it will 
form 
a committee for reform of the defense system between Jan. 10 and 
Feb. 28. 
  The committee, to be chaired by Superintendent of the Korea 
Military Academy Chang Song, will be divided into two 
subcommittees with one investigating the Yulgok military buildup 
project and the other probing military supplies.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, in 
the second year of his administration, wants to show "tangible 
benefits" of his reform to all the citizens in their daily lives. 
  "Our reform and change will now have to take place in the 
areas where the people's lives are directly involved," President 
Kim said Friday while presiding over a meeting of cabinet 
ministers and leaders of civic groups at Chongwadae. 
  "We have succeeded in laying down a broad framework for 
reform through the disclosures of personal assets of public 
officials and real-name financial transaction system," Kim said. 
  "From now on, reform will have to be carried out on a 
broader 
scale, based on the foundation we laid last year," he said. 
  Reform for the citizens' daily lives, the president 
explained, should be aimed at establishing a community of an 
advanced nation, where its efficiency and productivity is 
maximized and where the people are generally satisfied with 
their lives. 
  Kim, speaking at New Year's press conference Thursday, laid 
down the action outline for his administration: "The government 
must be able to visibly reduce all forms of inconvenience to 
citizens with a spirit of service. It must also seek out and 
help people in need." 
  It was obviously a step forward for President Kim, who must 
have realized that he could not go on receiving popular support 
of the people by just continuing his campaign to wipe out 
corruption and official irregularities. 
  His administration has to work for positive results that 
could immediately be felt by the people. 
  "Reform for living," Kim told Friday's meeting, "is directly 
connected with the welfare of the people." 
  The meeting was attended by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, his 
cabinet, heads of government agencies, provincial governors and 
leaders of large private social organizations. 
  What President Kim was saying was that since he completed 
diagonosis of "the Korean disease" in the first year of his 
administration, he has to start curing it through a brave and 
determined series of operations. His administration has to work 
to offer its people a safer, cleaner environment to live, an 
environment for pleasant living. 
  President also wants to build a much more orderly and honest 
society and help the people change their way of thinking and 
give them a proper and correct sense of values in life. 
  "We cannot join the ranks of advanced nations," Kim said, 
"unless we have got rid of large man-made disasters, waste 
disposal problems, crime and violence, drugs and juvenile 
crimes, conspicuous and wasteful spendings on luxurious things, 
traffic congestion and collective selfishness. All citizens 
should come to realize that law and order are meaningful only 
when they are observed by them, and freedom and individual 
rights can be enjoyed only after they have carried out their 
duty and responsibility," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- The government and its 
Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) agreed in a policy consultation 
on Friday [7 January] to prepare a package of anti-inflation 
measures before lunar New Year's day, Feb. 10. The package will 
include strong controls over cartel practices such as price 
fixing by automakers and measures to stabilize the prices of 
personal services. They also agreed to revise the five-year new 
economy plan to ensure steady growth on the basis of freer 
business activities in the private sector. 
  Under the revision, the government will no longer set goals 
for macroeconomic indicators, such as growth, inflation and 
balance of payments, from this year. 
  Also agreed to in the meeting, where Economic Planning 
Minister Chong Chae-sok led the government team and chief 
policymaker Yi Se-ki headed the DLP team, was a plan to study 
measures to pave the way for companies to pay bonuses in shares 
or convertible bonds instead of cash. 
  The government will take legal steps to encourage 
corporations to invest in infrastructure, while deregulating the 
capital market further so that listed companies have easier 
access to markets for rights issues and corporate bonds. 
  It will also prepare, by the end of March, a plan to raise 
15 
trillion won for rural development, which President Kim Yong-sam 
promised in his New Year press conference. They agreed to study 
positively a plan to allow corporations to introduce foreign 
commercial loans for capital investment.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- South Korean cars are 
popular in Russia because of their relatively low cost at a 
quality similar to Japanese and European cars, sources in Korea 
Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) and automakers said Friday. 
Korean cars sell for 5,000 U.S. dollars to 7,000 dollars less 
than their Japanese and European counterparts in Russia. 
  Because Hyundai and Kia opened dealerships in Russia last 
year, and are able to sell new cars here, and because Daewoo and 
Ssangyong are seeking sales outlets, exports to Russia are 
expected to be over 10,000 cars this year, the sources agreed. 
Hyundai Motor Corp. exported 1,500 cars to Russia last year and 
plans to double the amount this year. Daewoo Motor Co., which 
shipped 1,816 cars to Russia last year, expects to triple the 
number this year after setting up sales outlets. 
  Kia Motors Corp., which insists on cash payment, sold 200 
cars on the Russian market last year, and anticipates exporting 
500 this year. 
  Korean cars are exported to Russia under Generalized System 
of Preferences (GSP) status and subject to a tariff of 12.5 
percent, half the amount levied on Japanese and European cars. 
In addition, they gained price competitiveness from the strong 
Japanese yen. 
  "Because the roads are bad in Russia, cars need to be tough 
and cold-proof and Korean products are assessed to have equal 
qualities of those of Japan, the United States, Germany, and 
Sweden in that respect at a lower cost," a KOTRA official said. 
While other foreign cars cost between 15,000 dollars and 20,000 
dollars each, Korean cars are sold at 8,000 dollars to 15,000 
dollars.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- Container traffic on 
direct lines between South Korea and China will surpass that on 
routes between Korea and Japan this year for the first time, the 
Korea Maritime and Port Administration said Friday. Korea-China 
routes handled 215,000 teus (twenty-foot equivalent units) last 
year, up 67.9 percent from 1992, and will carry 350,000 teus 
this year, up 62 percent from 1993. Korea-Japan lines took 
306,000 teus in 1993, virtually unchanged from 305,000 teus in 
1992, and this year will haul 332,000 teus. 
  China will be in second place in containerized cargo with 
Korea for the first time this year, after the United States but 
ahead of Japan. 
  Korea and America exchanged 680,000 teus last year. 
  There are bright prospects for container traffic between 
Korea and China due to the rapid growth of china's external 
trade, which has expanded more than 20 percent annually since 
1985, and the ever-expanding Korean investment in China. The 
first direct line between Korea and China opened in 1989.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's shipbuilders 
defeated their Japanese rivals to make Korea the country with 
the largest volume of ship orders last year, but face a 
formidable challenge in holding on to the top spot this year. 
Industry insiders say that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has 
received orders for five 300,000-ton very large crude carriers 
(VLCC) from Saudi Arabia's state-run oil company. 
  Many shipbuilders around the world had competed for the 
Saudi 
Arabian VLCC fleet contract since it was announced in late 1991. 
In 1991, when the world shipbuilding market was booming, a VLCC 
was priced at 115 million U.S. dollars, but Mitsubishi cut its 
price to below 90 million dollars. The orders for five VLCCs, 
totaling 1.5 million tons, alone represent one-fourth of the 6.5 
million tons of orders placed with Japanese shipbuilders in all 
of last year. 
  Kawasaki Heavy Industries and other Japanese yards have 
received enough orders in the last month or two to keep them 
busy all year thanks to their stepped-up promotional programs 
and the yen's decline against the dollar. 
  The sources say Korean shipbuilders, who enjoyed a sharp 
price edge over their Japanese rivals on the rising yen last 
year, must now cut their prices to compete with the 
technologically-advanced Japanese yards as the yen is now 
falling. 
  Encouraged by their boom last year, Hyundai Heavy Industries 
and Samsung Heavy Industries are planning to expand their 
dockyards for building VLCCs, and this is feared to put domestic 
shipbuilders in cut-throat competition for the world VLCC market 
of about 20 vessels a year.

Incompatible Party Lines 
  Both the ruling and opposition camps are absorbed in 
wrangles 
over party lines. This phenomenon set in as soon as the 
audit-and-inspection drive, carried on by new government since 
its launching seemingly for the liquidation of the past, 
somewhat slowed down. On the other hand, it is also true that 
the disputes effectively put the brakes on the drive and the 
reform movement in both their speed and width. 
  The party line disputes are likely to reach all the way up 
to 
the Kim Yong-sam government. They are something totally new to 
the nation's political history which is run through with 
confrontations between "power and relationship." 
  Needless to say, it is also a fact that the party line 
dispute is a double-edged sword in that it is a very risky 
experiment that can produce a fatal impact on the whole spectrum 
of the political situation. 
  The dissensions within the ruling camp including the 
Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] led to controversies over whether 
to extend the current audit-and-inspection drive, and to a 
government-opposition dialogue, a leadership-level dialogue, and 
further to abortive National Assembly sessions. The disputes 
centered on two factions in the DLP--the RDP [former 
Reunification Democratic Party] faction dedicated to reforms and 
its rival, the DJP [former Democratic Justice Party] faction. 
  Although it was not open, the most serious of the disputes 
within the ruling camp was over the method of reform. In late 
March, when three lawmakers, including former National Assembly 
speakers Pak Chun-kyu and Kim Chae-sun, were forced to retire 
from politics and Reps. Chong Tong- ho and Yim Chun-won left the 
DLP--all in the swirl from the public disclosure of 
properties--the handwriting was on the wall. The former ruling 
forces led by the DJP faction protested that the crackdown on 
"the past" is outrageous. They unanimously insisted that 
"reforms should be carried out in accordance with law and 
system." "The audit-inspection drive against selected targets as 
in the cases of `targeted investigation' and `individual 
investigation,'" they charged, "points to a possible ulterior 
motive." They contended that the crackdown was politically 
motivated, that it targeted members of the DJP and NDRP [former 
New Democratic Republican Party] factions and on ex-military 
leaders. 
  However, under the pressure of the prevailing circumstances, 
their voices faded before having any chances of stirring an open 
debate. The reformists of the RDP faction brushed off the 
charges as "a nonsense." The group argued that reforms are 
inevitable and that the political purification under the 
keep-the-upstream-water-clean slogan is one thing that has to be 
done even if there are differences over the method. It also 
argued that to say that the past should not be questioned is to 
say that there should be no reform. 
  The factional difference continued and it came to the fore 
at 
every opportunity. The so-called "policy shift controversy" was 
a variation of the party line dispute. Whenever President Kim 
Yong-sam issued a new "declaration," it prompted different 
interpretations between factions. 
  The first clash came over the president's policy speech to 
the National Assembly on 22 October. The speech, focusing on 
"the future," suggested the unity of the two forces--the "Han 
River force" which performed the Han River economic miracle and 
the "democratization force." Leaders of the former ruling 
factions took it as a signal for a policy shift. They welcomed 
it. "The abominable audit-and-inspection drive is nearly over," 
they said. Further, they saw the president's references to the 
unity of the two forces as the show of an intent to form a new 
ruling force unattached to the past. However, it was not the 
case with the reformist group. "Shelving the reforms? No way. 
..." The reform program is the central, keynote policy of the 
new government, they insisted, and therefore it will be firmly 
kept in place through to the end of the President Kim's tenure. 
They warned against "distorting the meaning" of the president's 
speech. Chongwadae's response was even stronger. It usually 
jumps to its feet whenever there is a talk about a policy shift. 
  Trends were even more obvious after the 8 November 
Chongwadae 
meeting held to push for a new economy, in which President Kim 
called for the "building for the future." The former ruling 
faction saw it as a "policy shift" but Chongwadae officials 
explained the next day that "any interpretation suggesting a 
policy shift is at variance with the fact." 
At Feud Over Everything 
  The dispute between Reps. Yu Song-hwan and Kim Yun-hwan over 
the latter's past record was a case typifying the difference 
over "the past" between the RDP and DJP factions. At a 12 
October National Assembly Education Committee hearing on the 
administration of the Education Ministry, Yu questioned the past 
record of Kim, the virtual leader of the DJP faction. 
  He dropped a bombshell by saying "How about inviting Rep. 
Kim 
Yun-hwan to this hearing? He was a member of the Yujonghoe in 
the National Assembly [in the Pak Chong-hui era] and the head of 
the Chongwadae staff in the Chon Tu-hwan government. In the No 
Tae-u government, he served as the minister of state and the 
floor leader of the ruling party. I propose that we ask him what 
prompted him to do what he did in those days and what sort of 
patriotism he has these days to justify what he is doing now." 
  The DJP faction flew into a rage when Yu's remarks were 
reported. The faction was seized with group psychology, 
contending that if that should be a sin, there would be no one 
clean in the DJP faction. The RDP faction and even Chongwadae 
worked feverishly to allay the fury. According to a widespread 
observation, however, the episode eventually proved to be a 
contributing factor to about 36 "rebellious" votes cast by DJP 
faction members in a vote on a proposal for the release of Reps. 
Kim Chong-in and Pak Chol-on. 
  Kim Yun-hwan made no open rebuttal of Yun's remarks. He only 
expressed his feeling by saying that "the important thing is not 
the position a person held in the past but what he did in that 
position." In the RDP faction, while some accused Yu Song-hwan 
of a "grandstand play," it was an undeniable fact that many 
others basically shared the same feelings with Yu. 
  Similarly, the record of Chairman Kim Chong-pil became an 
issue. Although there has been no formal debate inside or 
outside the party, the RDP faction--the reformist group in 
particular--openly discussed an image of incompatibility between 
"reform" and Kim Chong-pil, a former "key leader of the 5.16 [l6 
May, 1961, coup] force." Then came the controversy over the 
qualification of former Secretary General Choe Hyong-u as member 
of the party Supreme Committee, sparking dissensions within the 
DLP. In the wake of that controversy, calls for changing the 
party chairman are not about to subside. The squabbles over the 
presidential decree that prohibited financial transactions using 
false names or aliases and the follow-up measures, plus the 
wrangles over the key economic policies and the government's 
foreign and unification policies, have all added to the 
political line disputes within the ruling camp. 
  The party line disputes, when viewed from a wider 
perspective, extend all the way to the North Korea issue, the 
nuclear issue in particular. Some DLP members of the National 
Assembly Committee on Foreign and Unification Affairs would 
assail cabinet members, particularly Foreign Minister Han 
Wan-sang, at every party-government session, and even at the 
committee's meetings in the National Assembly, for the 
government's appeasement policy toward North Korea. Some even 
accuse Han of espousing a peculiar ideology. 
  Meanwhile, other lawmakers criticize the government's 
political lines, charging that some presidential secretaries 
belong to the activist camp and have connections with 
chaeya [reformist camp] groups. They would argue 
loudly at private gatherings that no leftist or progressive 
reform has ever succeeded. Those presidential secretaries, they 
argue, have given the impression as if the government were being 
pushed around by them and, as a result, business communities are 
left unable to dispel their uneasiness. And the uneasiness is 
making an economic recovery impossible, they add. 
Political Line Dispute in the DP, Too 
  The Democratic Party [DP] under the Yi Ki-taek leadership is 
also seized with a serious case of party line dispute. In the 
configuration of its internal factions, however, the DP today is 
markedly different from what it used to be. First of all, 
factions became far more complicated and diverse. Groupings, 
large and small, cropped up after the retirement of Kim 
Tae-chung from politics, while many former chaeya 
activists have raised their collective voices against 
conservative cliques within the opposition camp. A more 
important change since the launching of the Kim Yong-sam 
government is the fact that diverse voices began to be heard on 
the role of an opposition party and that polemics on the 
political line thus started are heating up as days pass by. 
  Opposition parties in the past also had their shares of the 
party line dispute. And such disputes proved to be a leading 
factor drawing the line between the mainstream and the 
nonmainstream. But in those days, the dispute was structurally 
simple. It was over how to fight a seemingly formidable 
dictatorial regime. Thus, it led to the polemic on a clear-cut 
opposition party, which remains a legacy of the opposition camp. 
This is not to say that there were no differences within the 
opposition over economic and other policies. Such arguments, 
however, were obscured by the absolute proposition--the 
overthrow of the dictatorial regime. 
  Things have changed now. It is true that the various 
policies 
successively announced by the Kim Yong-sam government under the 
banner of reform triggered numerous disputes over their contents 
and speed and the method of implementation; however, they 
reflected the "opposition's perspective" of the past to some 
degrees. This drove the opposition into a new situation in which 
it was compelled to tackle the question of how to deal with the 
new government--more specifically, how to respond to the 
policies of the new government. In this sense, the past 9 months 
were an ordeal and experiment for the DP. Amid this ordeal and 
experiment, wrangles over the party line in various areas came 
to the fore in full details, without being obscured by an 
overthrow-the- dictatorship slogan as was the case with the 
opposition in the past. 
  The dissension is essentially different in nature from the 
"clear-cut opposition party" debate in the past. In the past, 
the question was who resists the dictatorial regime more 
staunchly. The focus of internal struggle now shifted to who can 
develop policies that can captivate the hearts of people and who 
can cultivate the capabilities to take power. Anti-government 
struggle is no longer the only task of an opposition party. The 
opposition is confronted by the new task of self-help and 
self-development. Unveiling itself to the full in the face of 
the new task is the "difference in philosophy" which had been 
dormant within the opposition and which could spawn a long-term 
intraparty discord if not handled properly. 
  This is not to say that the DP is all through with the 
obsolete "clear- cut opposition party" polemic. A typical 
example in this respect is the joint session of party executives 
and legislators of the DP held on 3 November in the National 
Assembly. At the session, Kim Sang-hyon, leader of the 
nonmainstreamers, who lost to Yi Ki-taek in a runoff vote in the 
DP national convention in March, launched a frontal attack on 
Chairman Yi Ki-taek's political line ("New Line"). He said: 
  "I do not think that the Kim Yong-sam government is a 
civilian government. Have we ever defined it a civilian 
government as a consensus of the party? It is a government 
created by a collusion with the military government in the 
three-party merger. Therefore, President Kim Yong-sam can be 
called a civilian president but the Kim Yong-sam government 
cannot be called a civilian government. Presently, the people 
think that the opposition is missing and drifting. We should 
take on the Kim Yong-sam government as an object of reform. We 
must not cling to or be sucked into the reform program of the 
Kim Yong-sam government. During the parliamentary inspection of 
the administration, Chairman Yi said that the DP would shelve 
the drive for the liquidation of the past and instead focus on 
the economy. I do not mean to say that the economy can be put on 
the back burner, but his speech contained no alternative plans 
for a positive liquidation of the past nor an agenda of 
opposition struggle. 
  "Most important is the liquidation of military culture. 
Morality cannot be established without the liquidation of the 
past. We are running the risk of playing bridesmaid to the Kim 
Yong-sam government. The Kim Yong-sam reform is a deception as 
long as an ex-leader of the 5.16 coup stays on as DLP chairman. 
As long as the ex-leader of the 5.16 coup remains as DLP 
chairman, it is necessary for us to cut off official contacts 
with the DLP and maintain unofficial contacts, and to lead on 
the public opinion." 
  Earlier, on 28 September, DP Chairman Yi Ki-taek told 
reporters that he would "put greater emphasis on the economy of 
the people than on the liquidation of the past." And in the 
subsequent National Assembly speech, he declared the 
future-oriented party New Line. Kim Sang Hyon was attacking the 
announced party line. It is a "strategy running the risk of 
reducing the opposition to a bridesmaid's role for the Kim 
Yong-sam government," he charged. 
  At the joint session that day, Yi Pu-yong, member of the 
Supreme Committee, spearheaded the attack. He is the leader of a 
reform group in the DP led by former chaeya 
activists. He said: 
  "There was a conflict in substance between Chairman Yi's 
National Assembly speech and the interpellation by DP 
legislators, causing confusion to considerable degrees. During 
the parliamentary inspection of the administration, while 
legislators requested the presence of many witnesses, the 
chairman held that we should not bring in too many businessmen 
as witnesses, causing a disarray among them. Furthermore, it is 
a problem that the chairman declared that there would be no 
linkage between the liquidation of the past and budget and 
reform legislation." 
  More scathing criticisms were heard at a general meeting of 
DP lawmakers held the next day. Chang Ki-uk, a member of the 
reform group, referred to the "clear-cut opposition party 
polemic," a vulnerable point of opposition leaders in general. 
He cited the cases of Yi Chol-sung, former chairman of the New 
Democratic Party, who proposed a middle-of-the-road merger but 
had to give it up and resign as chairman, and Yi Min-u, former 
president of the New Democratic Party, who, during the struggle 
for direct presidential election system in the Fifth Republic 
days, adopted a lukewarm attitude toward the ruling party's 
offensive for cabinet system and was eventually ousted from 
first-line politics by the two Kim's [Kim Yong-sam and Kim 
Tae-chung]. "The lesson is that the opposition party should have 
a clear-cut goal," he insisted. 
  The nonmainstreamers and ex-chaeya activists thus 
attacked Chairman Yi. Never had their offensive been stronger. 
Their focus was on parliamentary strategy. More basically, 
however, their criticism unveiled the deep-rooted difference 
over the Kim Yong-sam reform and the opposition's response to 
it. Collectively, they demand that the DP leadership recognize 
clearly the limitations of the Kim Yong-sam reform as a spinoff 
of the three-party merger and launch a more clear-cut struggle 
against the ruling party. They are questioning the attitude of 
Chairman Yi Ki-taek in this respect. 
Diverse Perspectives in the DP 
  Their mounting offensive against him took some of the starch 
out of Chairman Yi Ki-taek. Earlier, he had shown a rejection of 
the word "linkage" between pending political issues and a 
National Assembly agenda, but he has modified his line a bit. He 
now says that he is "prepared for a linkage." The National 
Assembly proceedings are currently revolving along this line of 
the opposition. 
  Then, how far can the nonmainstreamers go with their 
political line offensive? The history of the opposition parties 
shows that in a number of cases, forces that led the struggle 
for the cause of "clear-cut opposition party" emerged triumphant 
in the end. Then, does the latest party line dispute in the DP 
after all belong to that category? It is difficult to find an 
answer to that question. One thing is clear, however, and it is 
that judging from the trends, it is not necessarily the same as 
the cases in the past. There are signs everywhere that it is not. 
  First of all, the circumstances surrounding the opposition 
have changed. How it should fight the government remains its 
problem. But more importantly, the public demands that the 
opposition transform itself in conformity to the change of the 
times. The days are gone when people applauded the DP for its 
uncompromising, hard-line struggles. The DP learned its lesson 
from the results of its refusal to attend the inauguration of 
the president and its controversial boycott of a by-election. On 
the other hand, the public reaction to Chairman Yi's National 
Assembly speech was relatively affirmative, unlike the uproar it 
sparked among the nonmainstreamers and ex-chaeya 
activists. 
  Moreover, the "clear-cut opposition party" polemic in the 
past usually involved scandals of behind-the-scenes bargains 
with the ruling camp. Whenever the opposition slackened the 
reins of its anti-government struggle, rumors circulated had it 
that there were briberies or that they struck a secret deal. 
Morality of opposition figures, rather than their political 
lines, were the issue. That has now changed. Today, the line 
itself is literally the issue. 
  The fact that the political line, not morality, has become 
the issue means that a total victory or defeat has become an 
impossible thing in the political game. It means that one can 
compromise but no one can force his or her plan on others. 
  A typical example is the new system outlawing the use of 
false names and aliases in financial transactions. The DP has 
formed an anti-DLP front under a single, umbrella 
slogan--"Alternative legislation be enacted." The removal of the 
umbrella would expose two conflicting currents, however, 
including one demanding that the system be operated and 
reinforced in a more reform-worthy direction. If it were the old 
opposition party, and if the system should still be in the stage 
of a hypothetical one, the demand could have surely been 
applauded as an attitude befitting an opposition party. It was 
not the case this time. Many insisted that "the government plan 
should be eased up drastically in line with economic theories." 
Some lawmakers openly charged that "YS [Kim Yong-sam] is 
preoccupied with his popularity in disregard of the threat of an 
economic collapse." They even appeared to be painting a picture 
of "true courage" of themselves. 
  The controversy over the new financial system did not stop 
at 
it but escalated into a debate covering the whole spectrum of 
the economy. Members of an Economic Justice faction led by 
ex-chaeya activists argued that only when there is 
economic justice can there be a long-term economic recovery. 
They pay relatively greater concerns to the problems of workers, 
farmers and the urban masses and to the justice of distribution. 
On the other hand, realists on the economy contend that the 
pressing task of our economy is to improve its competitiveness 
at world markets and to revitalize itself. Chairman Yi's New 
Line is an indication that the latter have become a major force 
in the DP. 
  Chairman Yi's New Line is condensed in his 27 October 
National Assembly speech. He said in it: "Our economy is 
confronted by an overall crisis. It is bogged down in a serious, 
long-term recession. At a time when we are in what may well be 
called an unlimited economic war, we are growing increasingly 
uncompetitive as days go by." 
  The key words in that speech were "the 21st century" and 
"improvement in the nation's competitiveness." And to that end, 
the speaker stressed the pressing need for internationalization 
and the promotion of science. All these expressions and the 
consciousness behind it were impossible to find in the 
opposition party textbook in the past. Although the speech was 
later criticized by the nonmainstreamers from their standpoint 
of parliamentary strategy, it was positively received by far 
more people in the party on the day it was delivered. Many of 
them found the speech fresh because it was the first attempt to 
push the opposition's perspective to the horizon of the future 
and an alternative plan. 
  In fact, that the opposition leader focused on the future 
rather than the past, on alternative plans as well as on 
criticisms, was not the only important thing about the speech. 
It offered a confirmation that the New Line transcends the old 
framework of the opposition in its awareness of the economy and 
the future course of the nation. 
  Therefore, the party line dispute over Chairman Yi's New 
Line 
essentially takes on the appearance of a confrontation over the 
"difference in perspective." So, it can be said that the dispute 
is, in its nature, difficult to resolve. 
  In addition, the factional interests inside the DP are 
complicated. When former Chairman Kim Tae-chung led the 
opposition, he could manage the diverse forces in the party, 
ranging from the conservative to the progressive, and keep them 
together. He could do so in part thanks to his charisma, but it 
is also true that the circumstances at the time were in his 
favor. First of all, it was then imperative that the opposition 
should be united if it was to take power. The reverse is the 
case now. The DP today has neither a powerful, established 
leadership nor a target clear enough to rally against. 
Especially, the present factions in the DP are still in the 
phase of internal struggle and, consequently, preoccupied with 
gaining the control of the party. Thus, the wrangles over the 
political lines both in the DLP and the DP have emerged as a 
major factor making the whole picture of the political situation 
instable. 
  With regard to future political developments, the political 
line disputes currently going on in the ruling and opposition 
camps are of extremely important significance and nature. 
  First, in view of the inherent nature of the "political 
line," results of the disputes are likely to become a key factor 
determining future political territories. 
  Moreover, they will seriously influence the political 
positions and careers of everyone, be it the primary parties in 
the disputes (or political factions) or the onlookers. The 
disputes will extend into the upcoming series of major political 
agendas, beginning with the DLP national convention scheduled 
for May next year. 
  Second, the political line dispute is different in its 
nature 
from the competition for a position which is temporary and 
limited in scope. Inasmuch as it is a confrontation over 
principle and theory involving both the outlook on the present 
political situation and the blueprint for the future, the former 
takes on far more complicated and serious features than the 
latter. Although the disputes at the moment appear to be limited 
in scale, it is highly possible that they will further expand 
and intensify--depending on developments in the situation. 
  Third, in consequence of these possibilities, the political 
line disputes are working as an element of political 
instability, at the moment at least. 
  Based on these points, it should be noted that the current 
disputes in the political circles have an element in that could 
possibly lead to a political realignment by their "internal" 
energy for the first time in the nation's political history. 
Every transformation made by the political circles in this 
country to date were by the "force from outside." 
  But the current developments in the disputes are different 
in 
that they are of internal origins in every aspect. Especially, 
it should be noted that unlike his predecessors, President Kim 
has few effective means at his disposal to control the political 
forces. In addition, considering the local autonomy elections 
scheduled for 1995, the 15th general election to be held in 
1996, and the 1997 presidential election, the president has, 
strictly speaking, only one year before the first of these 
things begins. In that sense, too, politics under the Kim 
government will revolve around the political line disputes as 
its main axis, rather than factional strife. It seems that it 
cannot be otherwise.

  [Text] Lieutenant General Myo Nyunt, member of the State 
Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] and chairman of the 
Yangon [Rangoon] Division Law and Order Restoration Council 
[LORC], held a meeting with the chairmen of district and 
township LORCs at the conference room of the Yangon Division Law 
and Order Restoration Council Office at 0800 this morning. 
  Speaking at the meeting, Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said that the 
SLORC has assumed state responsibility for five to six years and 
that those present should not take their work lightly, but 
should discharge their duties with a new spirit and personnel in 
the new year of 1994 to strive for greater improvements. Lt. 
Gen. Myo Nyunt noted that it has been six months since the 
positions of chairmen of township LORCs, formerly held by 
military officers, have been held by personnel from the 
Department of General Administration. As former members of the 
LORCs, the new chairmen of the LORCs have no difficulty in 
discharging their duties, but they need to work with enthusiasm. 
  Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said the SLORC government is holding the 
National Convention for the emergence of the State Constitution 
in order to transfer state power to the people in accordance 
with democratic means as soon as possible. Training courses are 
being held to prepare for the administrative machinery, which 
will emerge in the future. Those who have undergone the 
training need to work in accordance with the motto: Quantity 
with Quality. They will be able to prove their ability in the 
workplace. 
  As they work in the capital city of Yangon, they will be 
under the constant scrutiny and supervision by state leaders and 
close observation by their immediate departmental superiors at 
township and district level. They should bear this in mind in 
their work. 
  Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said that in implementing the three major 
tasks of the SLORC, they should observe the following five 
factors: 
  1. Always strive to know who are the old and new residents 
in their respective areas; 
  2. Inspect the area under one's jurisdiction both 
publicly and incognito; 
  3. Move around unnoticed like wind in order to assess 
public behavior and the situation in districts and townships; 
  4. Do not engage in four kinds of improper conduct; those 
who become rich in a short time become poor in a short time; 
those who are wicked do not have enough to eat, those who are 
honest have more than enough to eat. Therefore, honestly and 
diligently work. 
  5. Discharge diligently one's duty. 
  Their constant duty is to ensure the prevalence of law and 
order and peace and tranquility. The basic task of the state is 
to promulgate and execute the existing laws and maintain the 
capabilities of the Defense Services. 
  Regulations on traffic, roads, and trading are being 
violated 
in some townships. There are muggings and robberies by gangs 
and trafficking and consumption of narcotic drugs. It is 
necessary for chairmen and members of district and township 
LORC's to act with care in order to ensure the prevalence of law 
and order. 
  The government is building roads where there are mountains 
and bridges where there are streams as part of its effort to 
ensure good transport and communications and to develop the 
country, including border regions. Irrigation projects are also 
being implemented to bring greenery to the regions. They need 
to cooperate with the development committees in various areas 
for road repairs and to build drainage and reclaim land. 
  A Shan proverb says: Look after one's land in one's country; 
it will be developed and prosperous one day. Accordingly, it 
will be necessary to give priority to agriculture. 
  Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said some who do not desire peace and 
tranquility in the city of Yangon and some power-mad 
politicians, who have entered the business sector with help and 
assistance from spies, are manipulating the market to keep 
prices high and thereby instigate the hungry into creating 
unrest. District and township LORCs must be vigilant against 
this and strive to satisfy the people's need for food, clothing, 
and shelter. Those who are manipulating prices on the 
assumption that commodity prices will fall if the price of rice 
falls will have to face the consequences. 
  Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt also said that security should not be 
overlooked. He said special care should be taken to prevent the 
disappearance of the language, religion, and nation and it will 
be necessary to open monastic schools and conduct courses on 
Buddhist culture. 
  Colonel Thura Myint Maung, deputy chairman of the Yangon 
Division LORC, then participated in the discussion and chairmen 
of district and township LORCs presented the situation in their 
respective areas. 
  In his closing address, Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said the National 
Convention will resume on 18 January 1994. He explained that 
the eight groups had achieved the basic principles for the 15 
chapter headings at the convention and that when the convention 
resumes, discussions will be held to obtain firm basic 
principles for each chapter. He said the Union Solidarity and 
Development Association [USDA] has been formed with five 
objectives, basic principles, and a code of behavior to strive 
for the emergence of a developed and modern state. Branches 
have been formed in divisions, districts, and townships. He 
urged those present at the meeting to give necessary assistance 
for the successful implementation of USDA programs and to serve 
in the USDA. 
  General Aung San said: Think and work for the reconstruction 
of Myanmar [Burma] and the preservation of our nation. Heroes 
plan and work to make our nation become powerful. Lt. Gen. Myo 
Nyunt said that there are currently some political parties with 
a tendency to depend on things foreign -- this could lead to the 
disappearance of the nation. Likewise, among the business 
sector there is the tendency to depend on things foreign as can 
be seen in the signboards with foreign names they put up. The 
meeting ended after Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt said that although names 
of townships, wards, and streets bearing English names and names 
of traitors had been changed during the SLORC administration, 
there are those who put up the foreign names and they must be 
duly informed.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The Malaysian-mooted and ASEAN-endorsed proposal for 
the formation of the East Asian Economic Caucus, EAEC, appears 
to have gained a boost by a report from Tokyo that Japan is 
ready to accept the concept. It is clearly a reversal of 
Japan's previous stance towards the idea and this is certainly 
welcome news for the six- member ASEAN. 
  Japan's change of mind apparently comes as a result of the 
establishment of the North American Free Trade Agreement or 
NAFTA which came into effect last weekend. Previously Japan had 
been non-committal towards the caucus idea for fear of hurting 
its largest trading partner, the United States. The U.S., under 
George Bush, had been vehemently opposed to the establishment of 
the EAEC because it knew that it would left out of the EAEC. 
  However, the present U.S. Administration under President 
Bill 
Clinton had been more receptive to the EAEC concept. So, Japan 
naturally has come to terms with the caucus as a means of 
achieving a diplomatic balance in the Pacific Rim region in the 
way from the expansion of economic ties between the U.S., Canada 
and Mexico. 
  The historic summit of the heads of state of the Asia 
Pacific 
Economic Cooperation in Seattle last November clearly showed 
that the U.S. was pushing for leadership of the 17-member body. 
Now, we have the European Economic Union or EEU and NAFTA 
looming large to become exclusive trading blocs. How then will 
East Asia fend for itself? The EAEC seems to be the right 
answer. The idea of the caucus, mooted by Malaysian Prime 
Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed three years ago, came about after 
the Uruguay Round of GATT talks had failed to produce the result 
as was scheduled in 1990. Japan had previously thought that the 
EAEC idea would jeorpadize the global trade talks. Now that the 
Uruguay Round has been successfully completed, Japan is in a 
position to reverse to its previous stance towards the EAEC. 
  The EAEC, as have been repeatedly pointed out by ASEAN 
leaders, is certainly not aimed at being an exclusive trading 
bloc. It is aimed at being a loose consultative forum where 
member countries can discuss economic issues of common concern 
and cooperate with each other for their mutual benefit. ASEAN 
countries have already commited themselves to an (?indifferent) 
free global trading system. Any of its member countries is free 
into bilateral trade with any other country of its choice. 
  Malaysia and ASEAN welcome the Tokyo report that Japan has 
declared its support for the EAEC concept. The caucus will 
become even more meaningful and fruitful if more East Asian 
countries like China, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong declare 
their support and join the EAEC to make the region the most 
dynamic in the world.

  [Text] Port Dickson, Malaysia, Jan 7 (BERNAMA) -- 
Recruitment of unskilled and semi-skilled workers from abroad 
has been frozen temporarily from Friday by the Malaysian 
government. 
  Deputy Home Minister Megat Junid Megat Ayob said the 
directive was issued by Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed, who 
is also Home Minister, at a meeting with officials of the 
ministry, immigration department and police Thursday. 
  The freeze is also to enable the government to assess the 
total levy that can be collected from foreign workers, he said 
to reporters after closing a national seminar on education for 
parent-teacher associations here. 
  However, he said, the employment of professionals could 
still 
be considered as there was a shortage in the country. 
  He said there were now an estimated 200,000 illegal 
immigrants either working without work permits or roaming in the 
country without valid travel documents. 
  In addition, there were foreigners being held at temporary 
immigration detention centres for working without valid permits. 
  He said the police and immigration department would soon 
step 
up operations to detect illegal immigrants in estates, 
construction sites and factories. 
  Those caught without any travel documents will be deported 
as 
soon as possible, he said.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, Jan 7 (AFP) -- Cambodia's powerful 
Chairman of Parliament Chea Sim endorsed Friday a controversial 
request from the Phnom Penh party to reinstate as members of 
parliament (MP) two hardliners who resigned their seats to lead 
a secessionist movement. 
  "I believe that the request will be accepted by all MPs in 
the spirit of national reconciliation," Chea Sim told AFP. 
  However, the move was adamantly opposed by many MPs from the 
royalist FUNCINPEC party, several MPs confirmed. One of those 
at the centre of the controversial request is Prince Norodom 
Chakrapong -- half brother and bitter foe of co-premier Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh -- who was deputy prime minister in the former 
communist Phnom Penh regime. The other is the former National 
Security Minister General Sin Song. 
  The two resigned their seats in parliament to lead a 
secessionist movement to protest against the Cambodian People's 
Party's loss to FUNCINPEC in the U.N.-supervised polls in May. 
  The movement collapsed within a few days and the leaders' 
seats in parliament were subsequently occupied by other CPP 
representatives as the former battlefield foes formed a 
coalition government. 
  The prince and the general, however, recently reappeared out 
of the political wilderness claiming they wished to "serve the 
nation" and indicated they wanted to return to their seats in 
parliament. 
  Chea Sim expressed his hope that the party leaders would 
instruct their members to approve the move beforehand so the 
reinstatement would not meet opposition in parliament. But 
FUNCINPEC MP Ahmad Yahya said it was "illegal" to let the two 
men back into the assembly as the constitution prohibited it. 
The constitution states that in the case of death, resignation 
or dismissal of an MP, "another representative shall be chosen 
to replace him or her". Another royalist MP deemed the move 
against the law. 
  "Normally the law would not allow for the return of these 
two 
persons to the National Assembly, but Chea Sim counts on the 
spirit of national unity to accept these two persons back," he 
said. 
  "Formally speaking the law does not allow this and he 
acknowledges this." 
  Although ardently opposed to move, the FUNCINPEC MP said he 
was a "disciplined party member" and would abide by the official 
party line on the matter. 
  When asked what the official line was, cabinet director to 
co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh Ly Thuch had no comment. 
  Party Secretary General and Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Prince Norodom Sirivut was unavailable for comment. But MP 
Ahmad Yahya said there was no room for compromise on the issue. 
  "Even if the party agrees on it, I am going against it," he 
said. "I do not want to do something illegal and I believe many 
others will support me". 
  Another FUNCINPEC MP said the two hardliners were 
"blackmailing" the party leadership to get their seats back. 
  "Chakrapong and Sin Song threaten that if they are discarded 
from power, they will reveal many things bad to the CPP 
mainstream," he said. "They're blackmailing them." 
  The radical Khmer Rouge claimed the attempt to rehabilitate 
the two secessionists proved that the government was still under 
the control of the leaders of the former Phnom Penh regime -- 
despite the fact Prince Ranariddh is co-premier and FUNCINPEC is 
the largest party in the coalition government. 
  By appointing "traitors, killers and corrupt officials" as 
MPs, the government was "eating the flesh, drinking the blood, 
and sucking the marrow from the Khmer people's bones", a Khmer 
Rouge statement said.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 7 Jan (AKP) -- The province of Kompong 
Speu, some 50 km west of Phnom Penh, could suffer a food 
shortage of more than 60,000 tonnes in 1994, according to the 
local agriculture service. 
  This shortage is caused by prolonged drought that devastated 
thousands of hectares of rice. During the rainy season the 
province put a total area of 65,000 hectares under rice 
cultivation or 65 percent of the plan. 
  Nearly 30,000 hectares have been harvested with an average 
yield of over a tonne per hectare compared to a tonne and a half 
in the previous year. 
  This year's rice production would be around 65,000 tonnes 
which could feed the province's population of 465,000 for only 
four months, says the same source.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP January 7 -- At least 15 companies 
have applied for a slice of a lucrative domestic telephone 
contract being offered by the Cambodian Government, a local 
newspaper reports Wednesday. 
  The contract would provide provincial telephone systems at 
20 
sites throughout Cambodia. 
  The networks would be linked to the $30-million satellite 
system installed in late 1991 by the U.N. Transitional Authority 
(UNTAC) that policed a peace pact in the country, the 
English-language Cambodian daily said. 
  Before the Australian Company Telstra-OTC installed the 
state-of- the-art UNTAC satellite system, the only working phone 
network in Cambodia was an antiquated domestic one in Phnom Penh. 
  The newspaper quoted Cambodian Minister for Post and 
Telecommunications So Khun as saying: "There is real interest in 
the UNTAC satellite system. We have received 15 applications, 
and I have already had five companies knocking on my door to 
find out what (we) will be offering." 
  According to So Khun, licenses to operate on the UNTAC 
facility would be awarded in April. 
  Cambodia currently has four mobile phone systems in 
operation, mostly set up by Thai companies but with one from 
Malaysia. 
  The 22,000-strong UNTAC force was deployed in Cambodia after 
the signing of an international peace agreement in Paris in 1991.

  [Excerpts] Minister and State Secretary Murdiono addressed 
a news conference in Jakarta this afternoon. He said that 
Indonesia believes a solution to the nuclear crisis in the 
Korean peninsula will boost mutually beneficial economic 
cooperation and ties among the countries of the world. At the 
same time, it will also contribute to the creation of world 
peace, security, and prosperity. 
  Continuing, Minister Murdiono explained that Indonesia, as 
chairman of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM], has been monitoring 
the issue of the nuclear program with concern. The NAM chairman 
[President Suharto] is concerned about the postponement of the 
third round of negotiations between the DPRK and the United 
States, the direct talks between the DPRK and ROK, and the talks 
between the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy Agency. On 
the occasion, Minister Murdiono said that the NAM chairman sent 
Nana Sutresna to the DPRK in December 1993 as the NAM's 
representative to advise the authorities on how to solve the 
issue through negotiations. [passage omitted] 
  According to Murdiono, the NAM representative has been 
assigned to continue monitoring developments surrounding the 
nuclear issue in Korea.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Indonesian Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas welcomed Japan's reported support for a 
proposed East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) after it had 
previously shown a cautious stance to the idea, the state-run 
news agency ANTARA reported Friday [7 January]. 
  It quoted him as saying Thursday, "I'm grateful to hear of 
Japan's commitment." 
  In its Wednesday edition, a leading Japanese daily, the 
ASAHI 
SHIMBUN, quoted unidentified government officials as saying that 
Japan has decided to "commit itself" to the regional forum after 
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into effect 
on January 1. 
  Japan had been guarded in its support for EAEC, proposed by 
Malaysia, because the United States, its major trading partner, 
was against the idea, fearing it would be excluded. 
  Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed stayed away from 
an informal summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum in Seattle in November. 
  Alatas said a ministerial meeting in Singapore last year of 
the Association of Southeast [Asian] Nations (ASEAN) agreed to 
include the EAEC in the APEC framework. "So, the EAEC is not a 
threat to the APEC," he said. 
  ASEAN had accepted the caucus as an economic consultative 
forum, Alatas said, adding that APEC "more or less" agreed to 
the East Asian forum. 
  Potential members of EAEC are the six ASEAN countries -- 
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and 
Thailand -- and China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. 
  APEC comprises these countries plus Australia, Canada, 
Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and the U.S.

  [Text] According to an Agriculture and Forestry Ministry 
news release, rice yields in many provinces fell below the 
targets this year due to considerable losses caused by severe 
natural disasters. Rice production figures this year are almost 
the same as those in 1991 -- the year in which central and 
southern rice fields were devastated by floods. The natural 
disasters were felt in almost all provinces. Some provinces 
were ravaged by floods, while others suffered drought or pests. 
As a result, many provinces, such as Savannakhet, Sayaboury, 
Saravane, Bolikhamsai, Houa Phan, and Luang Prabang Provinces, 
are expected to face rice shortages. As for Champassak, 
Attopeu, Luang Namtha, Vientiane, and Khammouane Provinces, they 
are expected to be self-sufficient in rice. 
  The Agriculture Ministry also reported that this year the 
national shortage is expected to be approximately 299,520 metric 
tons of paddy or 179,712 matric tons of rice. It is estimated 
that some 350,000 people in the cultivated areas and fallow land 
destroyed by pests are expected to face rice shortages beginning 
in the middle of the year.

  [Text] Vientiane, January 7 (KPL) -- Last year, the rice 
harvest of both dry and rainy seasons in Khammouane totalled 
76,986 tons of paddy. The second rice crop's turned out 3,856 
tons while the highland rice farming yielded 1,430 tons. 
  According to an official of the local agriculture service, 
the output may not meet the demand in consumption of 230,000 
residents in this central province. Accordingly, rice shortage 
is likely to loom over the province for two months this year. 
  The shortfall in rice production in Khammouane was due to 
severe floods, drought and pests which damaged 3,321 ha 
[hectares] of farmland. 
  In compensation for the losses, the agriculture service has 
encouraged for the cultivation of starchy crops and for rice 
farming on 154 ha with an expected yield of 4.45 tons of paddy 
per ha.

  [Text] When the 1947 Military Bases Agreement ended in 
1991, the Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) became the avenue for 
continuing security relations between the Philippines and the 
United States. 
  How effective and fair is the MDT to either side? Like the 
other treaties between the two countries, the MDT favors the 
United States and is disadvantageous to the Philippines. 
  Negotiated at the height of the Cold War, the MDT was signed 
in 1951, a time when the Philippines was at its weakest, as it 
was then recovering from the effects of the last world war. The 
United States was at its mightiest, after emerging fairly 
unscathed in the battle of major powers. 
  The Philippines had no choice because it badly needed U.S. 
support to rebuild its war-ravaged economy. 
  Although the MDT was anchored on the two countries' common 
determination for defense against external attack and for strong 
efforts for collective defense to preserve peace and security in 
the Pacific area it contains two main provisions deemed 
disadvantageous to the Philippines. 
  The first is the issue of automatic response; the second, 
the 
scope of "metropolitan area." 
  The MDT's Article IV states: "Each party recognizes that an 
armed attack in the Pacific area on either of the parties is 
dangerous to its peace and safety and declared that it would act 
to meet the common dangers in accordance with its constitutional 
processes." 
  Critics of the treaty admit that the issue of automatic 
response in case of an attack in Philippine territory is not 
guaranteed in the Article, as the phrase "in accordance with 
constitutional processes" signifies. 
  Filipino military officials regard the absence of automatic 
response in case of an aggression on the Philippines as 
psychologically disadvantageous since similar treaties which the 
United States has entered into with South Korea and North 
American Treaty Organization (NATO) countries guarantees such 
automatic response. 
  Article V states: "An armed attack on either of the parties 
is deemed to include an armed attack on the metropolitan 
territory of either of the parties, or the island territories 
under its jurisdiction in the Pacific Ocean, its armed forces, 
public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific." 
  According to critics, this provision assures U.S. military 
action only on attacks of Philippine territory. But it excludes 
other areas, particularly part of the Spratlys, of which the 
Philippines exercises historic or legal right. 
  Since the Spratlys are now a potential "flashpoint" in Asia, 
mainly because of the territorial claims of several other 
nations, this provision means that the Philippines could not 
expect anything from the United States in case any of the 
claimant-nations uses military action in annexing the Spratlys 
portion, which it regards as part of Philippine territory. 
  Critics said President Fidel Ramos should have sought a 
clarification from U.S. President Bill Clinton about these two 
particular provisions in their one-on-one meeting at the White 
House in Washington.

  [Text] With only a year before its application, the 
Philippines still has yet to harness its capability to 
competently implement the Common Effective Preferential Tariff 
(CEPT), Bureau of Customs Commissioner Guillermo L. Parayno, Jr. 
admitted recently. 
  In an interview, Mr. Parayno told BUSINESS WORLD hardly any 
of his staff has been trained to effectively implement the CEPT, 
a set of lowered tariffs for products which contain 40 percent 
ASEAN indigenous products in the intra-regional trade route. 
The tariff scheme is set to take effect starting tomorrow. 
However, the Philippines was able to get a one-year deferment 
as it has its own set of tariff reduction scheme under Executive 
Order 470. 
  Based on the agreed CEPT rates these products will be 
subjected to 30 percent if they are processed goods, 20 percent 
if intermediate products, and 10 percent if raw materials. 
After 15 years, three rates will be further scaled down to only 
a maximum of 6 percent. 
  The crux of the implementation of the CEPT will be in 
verifying if the import fall under the purview of the program. 
  "I have to be honest with you," he told BUSINESS WORLD, "we 
are not organized as of now...I believe that it is going to be a 
very difficult for the BoC [Bureau of Customs]... But with the 
amount of work I have, I haven't given it a thought on how to 
control it." 
  According to Mr. Parayno, "What gives me the creeps is the 
possible extent of fraudulent and inaccurate certification, it 
will affect customs revenue to the effect that transshipment 
from other countries not covered by AFTA [ASEAN Free Trade Area] 
passing through AFTA countries, but will be certified as from 
AFTA." 
  It must be noted that since Singapore, a free port area 
where 
goods from any part of the world can enter freely, has tasked 
its private sector groups, specifically the business chambers, 
to certify the origin criterion of all its exports out of the 
country into its trading ASEAN partners. Some observers pointed 
out that since the Singaporeans will have no interest in 
outbound goods the certification might be done haphazardly. 
  Despite the urgency of the matter, the bureau has yet to 
identify which among the divisions will handle the 
implementation of CEPT. 
  However, Mr. Parayno hinted he might coordinate with local 
business chambers, as they stand to lose due to uncontrolled 
influx of cheap goods, to countercheck the verifications given 
by their counterparts in other countries as one possible 
solution. 
  At present, the bureau is in the thick of computerizing its 
whole port operations and privatizing the release and disposing 
of seized goods.

  [Text] The Philippine Navy said yesterday it will deploy 
more boats in the country's major fishing grounds to deter 
poaching, piracy, and illegal fishing. 
  Vice Adm. Virgilio Q. Marcelo, Navy chief, revealed his 
plans 
to intensify the campaign to stop the unauthorized exploitation 
of the country's waters to discourage foreign fishing boats from 
poaching and crack down on dynamite and cyanide fishing. 
  He added that the Navy started installing cameras and 
satellite-based positioning equipment on naval planes. 
  The Navy chief said this will resolve complaints on the lack 
of documented evidence against poachers and illegal fishermen to 
push their prosecution in court. He said that while the Navy 
gets many reports on intrusions, the government cannot press its 
case against violators without strong evidence. 
  The Navy chief outlined his other goals, including the 
acquisition of a second U.S. built logistic support vessel 
(LSV), the construction of a third 140-foot "Aguinaldo Class" 
patrol boat, the strengthening of search-and-rescue (SAR) 
capabilities, and the increase in the "steaming time" of Navy 
patrol boats and "flying time" of naval patrol planes. 
  Marcelo said the Navy will sustain its programs to produce a 
"lean and compact, efficient and cost-effective organization," 
including boosting the reservist program. 
  Meanwhile, in his 1993 accomplishment report, Marcelo said 
the Navy conducted 2,171 patrols and 205 sealift missions, 
including its transport services to Batanes where there is no 
commercial shipping traffic. 
  Navy ships have been transporting food, medicine, and other 
basic commodities, and construction materials used for 
government projects in Batanes. 
  In counter-insurgency operations, Navy and Marine soldiers 
killed 27 rebels, captured 212 others, and recovered 47 
firearms, mostly from secessionist "Lost Command" groups in 
Mindanao. 
  Marcelo said the Navy seized over P275 million [Philippine 
pesos] worth of smuggled goods, including the interception of 
P150 million worth of "shabu [methaphethamine hydrochloride]," 
its biggest single haul this year. 
  The Navy also seized 108 vessels for illegal fishing and 
another 60 vessels for transporting illegally cut logs.

  [Text] The recent death of former New People's Army [NPA] 
Commander Victor Martinez will not affect the coming peace talks 
between the government and the National Democratic Front [NDF]. 
This was the statement made by Congressman Jose Yap. 
  Yap said that until the identity of the killer of Martinez 
is 
known, its death should not be a destabilizing factor in the 
peace process. 
  According to Yap, there is a possibility that the killer of 
Martinez is NPA. If the military is behind the killing, it is 
acting on its own. It has never been the policy of the 
government to kill anyone leading a rebel group.

  [Text] Government troopers and communist rebels fired at 
each other in Aklan early this week, the first breach so far of 
the 17-day unilateral cease-fire declared by the government and 
the shorter truce declared by communist rebels themselves. 
  Military reports said soldiers of the 47th Infantry 
Battalion 
led by 2d Lt. Fernando Rey battled 15 New People's Army (NPA) 
insurgents near Barangay [village] Malindong, Ibajay. 
  At least one soldier was killed and another wounded, with 
undetermined casualties on the side of the rebels. 
  Two Huey helicopters were sent to evacuate the government 
casualties while an MG-520 gunship provided fire support. 
  The reports said the rebels were believed to have come from 
a 
meeting held during the 25th anniversary of the Communist Party 
last Sunday. 
  The reports said Army troopers were chasing after the 
rebels. 
  The guidelines for the truce released by Defense Secretary 
Renato De Villa ban soldiers from going on offensive operations, 
including combat patrols. They may, however, take purely 
"defensive actions." 
  In Cagayan, an NPA rebel was captured while being treated in 
a hospital. He was identified as Benigno Caru, alias Ka 
[Comrade] Louie, whom the military believes belongs to a rebel 
group operating in the Zinundungan Valley. 
  Caru was moved to a government hospital where he could be 
better guarded, the reports said. 
  The arrest was made possible by citizens who reported Caru's 
presence to the Lasam town mayor who in turn informed the Army's 
65th Infantry Battalion. 
  De Villa had said that while the cease-fire is in effect 
from 
21 December to 6 January, all rebels, including communist 
insurgents, can freely move around the country as long as they 
do not carry firearms. 
  There was no mention in the report of any firearm found on 
Caru. 
  Military officials were unavailable for comment.

  [Text] Two suspected members of the Abu Sayyaf Group who 
were earlier arrested by police authorities in connection with 
the series of bombings in Davao City are reportedly missing. 
  And to complicate matters, higher police authorities in 
Davao 
denied having arrested the suspects identified as Abdul Munib, 
and Jacob Ibrahim. The extremist Abu Sayyaf Group was held 
responsible for a series of kidnappings and bombings in Mindanao 
last year. 
  Senior Inspector Tranjirol Ainin, Sta. [Santa or Holy] Ana 
Patrol Station Commander however, insisted he led a team of more 
than 20 operatives which swooped down on Treasure Inn, where 
Munib and Ibrahim were billeted Tuesday night. The inn is just 
a kilometer away from the San Pedro Cathedral. 
  Ainin said Munib had been positively identified by five 
witnesses as one of three armed men who lobbed one of three 
grenades inside the cathedral Sunday night, which killed seven 
persons and injured 150 others. 
  The Sta. Ana police commander said the two were also among 
25 
Tausugs rounded up near the cathedral at about 10 PM Tuesday. 
  He said intelligence reports had also tagged Munib and 
Ibrahim as being part of the group which planted a bomb at the 
Fortune Inn in Davao which killed three persons in 1992. 
  Presidential Peace Adviser Oscar Santos warned against 
immediately attributing the spate of Mindanao bombings to 
religious fanaticism, saying this could unwittingly encourage a 
religious war. 
  Santos said: "For the sake of the innocent population of 
Davao, let us move cautiously so as not to ignite further 
violence. We do not know if the bombings are religiously 
motivated." 
  "We may be imputing a Muslim-Christian conflict where there 
is none." 
  Earlier, Senior Superintendent Teddy Carian, regional police 
chief, said a group calling itself the New Christian Democratic 
Army claimed responsibility for the attacks on three Muslim 
mosques allegedly in retaliation to the bombing of the San Pedro 
Cathedral. The claim was made in telephone calls made to 
newspaper offices and radio stations in Davao City, he said. 
  President Ramos hailed leaders of multi-sectoral 
organizations of Davao City for joining hands with government in 
its resolve to put an end to the spate of violence in that city. 
  "The people of Davao City have shown us how the people, 
united and working together, can deal with irrational elements 
out to sow fear and hatred particularly during the holiday 
season," he said.

<F P=106> [By Frank Longid Jr. and Nelson Bagaforo] </F>
  [Text] The Philippine National Police (PNP) is offering a 
P500,000 [Philippine pesos] reward for any information that will 
help solve the bombings in Davao City or lead to the arrest of 
the bombers. 
  Director Pantaleon Dumlao, PNP deputy chief for operations, 
said the reward hopefully would encourage reluctant witnesses to 
cooperate fully with the police. 
  The witnesses could even request anonymity, according to PNP 
Director General Umberto Rodriguez. 
  A senior police officer said the reward was put up because 
the PNP still cannot clearly establish which group or groups 
carried out the bombing of the San Pedro Cathedral in Davao City 
and the subsequent explosions at three mosques. 
  The police announced on Wednesday the arrest of two suspects 
in the cathedral attack. 
  Intelligence reports indicated the two suspects, Abdul Munib 
and a man identified only as Jacob, belong to the Abu Sayaf, a 
Muslim extremist group. This has led police to deduce the Abu 
Sayaf is behind the bombing of the cathedral. 
  But the police official said the police is "still looking" 
for more solid evidence against Munib and Jacob. So far, 
investigators are going by intelligence reports which said that 
the two arrived in Davao City from Jolo via Basilan on the last 
week of November along with 23 other Abu Sayaf members. 
  "Even if the Abu Sayaf really is responsible for the attack 
on the cathedral," the source said, "there is still the matter 
of solving the bombing of the mosques." 
  One police official in Davao is certain both the attacks on 
the cathedral and on the mosques were made by only one group. 
  This group, according to Senior Superintendent Teddy Carian, 
police regional director, is out to sow chaos in Mindanao. 
  "There exists a group that is out to create chaos between 
our 
Muslim brothers and Christians. Their targets are religious 
structures," Carian said. 
  During the joint meeting yesterday of the Regional Peace and 
Order Council and the Regional Development Council, Carian said 
the bombers have only one objective: "Open a rift and create 
animosities that will open hostilities between Christians and 
Muslims in Mindanao." 
  Carian and Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte also denied two 
Muslim 
men have been arrested as suspects in the cathedral bombing. 
  "So far, there are no apprehensions made. No one is under 
our custody," Carian said. 
  "We are not in a hurry. We haven't arrested a single 
suspect," Duterte said. 
  It was Senior Inspector Tadgiro Ainin, the Santa Ana police 
chief, who announced the arrest of Munib and Jacob, who was 
positively identified by at least five witnesses. 
  Carian said, "The same criminal groups which initiated these 
bombings in the first place," and a so-called "New Christian 
Democratic Army," which claimed responsibility for the attack on 
the three mosques, was part of this group. 
  "I should not wonder if later on, there will be another 
group 
claiming to be anti-Christian group," he added.

  [Text] Chiang Mai -- Economic prospects in the North seem 
bright this year with 80-100 investment projects near fruition. 
The number of projects launched this year is not likely to be 
much more than last year's 129, according to Chaiyot Santiwong, 
director of the Northern Region Investment Promotion Office. 
This is because of government policy, particularly 
decentralisation of growth to the provinces, and promotional 
privileges for the rural zone three. 
  "Low interest rates, the plan to set up a new industrial 
estate in Phichit, economic cooperation with Thailand's 
neighbouring countries and low labour costs have boosted the 
economy," he said. 
  Interest-rate levels and government stability have made the 
country more attractive to international investors, he said. 
  The global economy is improving slightly, especially in the 
United States, and the economic and trade policies of former 
socialist countries have changed positively: Mr Chaiyot sees 
opportunities for public service infrastructure, hotel, 
residential building and environmental preservation projects in 
Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Lamphun and Lampang. 
  In the lower northern provinces, promotional privileges will 
assist machinery, metal and other industries. 
  "The establishment of a new industrial estate in Phichit is 
intended to stimulate competition in the lower North," he said. 
  The Board of Investment's [BoI's] northern office forecast 
about 8 percent growth for the northern region this year, 
compared to 1993's 7.8-7.9 percent. 
  Last year was seen as a golden time for investment in the 
North he said. The BoI-approved plans involved total investment 
of about 1,000 million baht. These created 25,038 jobs. 
  In 1989, which was seen as a good year, there were 73 
projects worth a total of 11,273 million baht. These created 
18,208 jobs. 
  In 1992, only 32 schemes were approved with a total 
investment of 4,267 million baht. These created 8,749 jobs. 
  Last year, 100 projects (77.5 percent) were located in the 
upper North and 29 (22.5 percent) were in the lower North. 
Thirty-four projects were in Chiang Mai, 30 in Lamphun, 15 in 
Tak, 10 in Lampang and eight in Chiang Rai. Seven projects were 
in Nakhon Sawan and five in Phetchabun. 
  Mr Chaiyot said 35 industrial projects, mostly involving 
mines, ceramics and metal production, had a combined cost of 
2,688 million baht and created 4,388 jobs. These factories are 
in Tak, Chiang Mai and Lampang. 
  Twenty-seven projects involved garments, textiles, shoes and 
ornaments with a combined cost of 597 million baht. These 
created 7,886 jobs and are mostly in Chiang Mai, Lamphun or 
Chiang Rai. 
  Twenty-one projects were related to infrastructure and 
services, 19 were agro-industrial factories, 15 were electronics 
factories, nine involved metal production, machinery, equipment 
and tools, and three involved petrochemical industries paper and 
plastics. 
  Promotional privileges were granted for projects costing a 
total of 1,795 million baht aimed at the export markets. These 
created 5,583 jobs. 
  Mr Chaiyot said Thais spent a total of 7,138 million baht on 
92 projects in the North last year. These created 18,777 jobs. 
  Twelve projects involving foreigners cost a total of 753 
million baht and employed 1,768 people. These factories were 
owned by Japanese, European, US, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korean 
interests. 
  Twenty-five projects were joint ventures between Thais and 
foreigners. These cost 1480 million baht and created 4,513 
jobs, Mr Chaiyot said.

"Discordant Voices Under the Pretext of Religion"] 
  [Text] External anti-Vietnamese forces have tried hard to 
advance slanderous and distorted allegations against Vietnam in 
a bid to portray Vietnam as violating democratic principles and 
human rights. They are looking for excuses to interfere, 
supposedly to protect human rights in Vietnam. They want to 
initiate a permanent and long-term anti-Vietnam campaign to 
foment instability and obstruct our people's national renovation 
now being initiated and led by the Communist Party of Vietnam. 
  Of late, taking advantage of the complex situation created 
by 
the extremists in the former An Quang Buddhist Church, the 
external forces have added fuel to the fire. Promptly seizing 
this opportunity, they have unjustifiably linked the human 
rights issue with religious causes. They have resorted to every 
trick to internationalize this issue by taking advantage of 
foreign forums to give slanderous testimonies against Vietnam. 
  Earlier, a number of foreign strategists who are unfriendly 
to Vietnam held that to carry out a long-term anticommunist 
campaign, it is necessary to rely on the force of religion. 
These strategists also predicted that the puppet army, the 
puppet regime, and other parties would fall apart and that in 
Vietnam, the religious problem is one of the factors that could 
be exploited to stir up the situation, and thus create permanent 
instability. 
  Taking advantage of religion at home and abroad, a number of 
people in priests' robes have been and are following the advice 
of the above strategists. They are allying themselves with one 
another in setting up various single-religion or inter-faith 
organizations and committees. Their purpose is to rally and to 
get external forces to cooperate with internal forces in a bid 
to pressure other countries and international organizations into 
intervening or offering help. They have vociferously claimed 
that at many places -- such as in front of the parliamentary 
buildings of many countries, by the side of the new cathedral of 
the Rome Missisonary College, at the Vienna Human Rights 
Conference, and at the 1993 youth gathering in Denver -- that 
human rights, with freedom of religion being the most important, 
are the yardsticks to measure the degree of democracy of a 
country. Turning to Vietnam, they slander Vietnam for 
persecuting religion and for violating human rights. 
  Everyone knows that assisted and agitated by exiles such as 
Vo Van Ai from France, Thich Quang Ba from Australia, and Thich 
Ho Giac and Thich Vien My from the United States, a number of 
evil elements in the An Quang Buddhist Church have done many 
things at variance with Buddhist scripture. For instance, they 
have driven a wedge into Buddhist unity. They have written 
documents distorting the truth and have taken advantage of our 
open-door policy and our expansion in international exchanges 
and telecommunications to slip these documents out to the 
external forces, rigging up a myth about Vietnamese Buddhism 
crying for help for having suffered from persecution for the 
second time. 
  Taking advantage of exiled Buddhists, a number of elements 
converged on the headquarters of the European Paliament to stage 
a hunger strike to press the parliament -- in session at the 
time -- to pass an anti-Vietnam motion. 
  Regrettably, due to this pressure, representatives of 
various 
groups in the parliament drafted a motion and kept it handy. 
Citing the petition of the exiled Buddhists as an excuse, the 
European Parliament issued a motion calling on member countries 
of the European Coordination Committee to pressure the 
Vietnamese Government into respecting the freedom of religion. 
  In early October 1992, sponsored by a number of on-site 
forces, the Rome-based Central Office of Overseas Vietnamese 
Catholic Apostle Affairs Committee headed by Monsignor Tran Van 
Hoai organized an inter-religious ceremony on behalf of various 
overseas Vietnamese religions such as Buddhism, Protestanism, 
Cao Dai, and Hoa Hao to pray for peace in Vietnam. 
  In their speeches, the head delegates all resorted to false 
arguments to distort the truth, claiming that peace does not 
mean an end to or the absence of war. Instead, peace 
necessitates the respect for human rights, including freedom of 
conscience and freedom of religion for all individuals and 
organizations. In their opinion, the objective of this function 
was to provide each religious group with a chance to think about 
its responsibility toward the cause of democracy-building in 
Vietnam. The Cao Dai group ambitiously maintained that since 
mundane affairs are handled by the United Nations, so should 
religious affairs. The United Religions may request the United 
Nations to intervene with Vietnam in the human rights issue. At 
last, the function gave birth to an extranenous body, the `92 
Roma Group, formed by representatives of different Vietnamese 
religious organizations overseas to continue to give advice to 
the action program for peace and human rights in Vietnam. 
  A survey of the history of the Vietnamese revolution 
indicates that for more than a half a century, the Communist 
Party of Vietnam has guided the entire people in making the 
great August Revolution a success, and henceforth, bringing 
about national independence, civil rights, freedom, people's 
material and moral welfare, and happiness. With the victory of 
the two wars of resistance which lasted for 30 years, the nation 
was reunified and people in both parts of the country now live 
under the same roof. What was lost due to the division and 
separation caused by the war of aggression can be recovered in 
full now through a unified country which opens her arms to 
welcome everyone, including different religious organizations. 
The rumors about a bloodbath following the end of the war 
turned out to be unfounded. We closed a final chapter, 
conducting educational activities to help those criminals who 
had participated in the old regime to mend their ways and become 
useful citizens in society. Afterward, those elements also had 
the chance to make their aspirations come true by obtaining 
permission to leave for resettlement in foreign countries of 
their choices under the ODP [Orderly Departure Program] and HO 
[expansion unknown] Programs. It could be said that only a few 
countries in the world have adopted the same humanitarian policy 
like Vietnam where great importance is attached to human rights 
and peace whereas repression, retaliation, and bloodshed are 
nowhere to be seen. These traits mark the traditions and moral 
values of the Vietnamese people. 
  Over the past years, in the framework of the renovation 
policy, Vietnam has opened its doors to welcome all friends and 
made every effort to integrate itself into the world community. 
It is Vietnam's policy to befriend all countries of the world. 
Vietnam has attracted investment to develop the national 
economy and enhance everyone's material and moral welfare. The 
people's lives have constantly been improved both materially and 
spiritually. Society has become more and more civilized with 
each passing day. The Vietnamese people in general and faithfuls 
of different religions in particular are making joint efforts to 
achieve and preserve noble goals, namely genuine peace and 
respect for human rights that Vietnam has gained and is now 
making sustained efforts to consolidate. There is no such 
things as harsh treatment or discrimination based on religion 
the outsiders are trying to accuse us of. 
  In our opinion, those who have left the fatherland and use 
religion as a pretext to call on Vietnam to show respect for 
human rights and to look squarely at the truth should follow the 
examples set by overseas Vietnamese residents who are seeking 
ways to contribute to national reconstruction, no matter how 
insignificant their contributions may be. Let them stop 
clinging to the human rights float as soon as possible and avoid 
using religion as a smokescreen to cover up their crimes against 
their fatherland and compatriots.

  [Text] Despite difficulties and harsh competition, Hanoi's 
state-run trade sector took positive steps in 1993 to expand its 
services. As a result, it posted a turnover of more than 457 
billion dong. The food catering service alone generated nearly 
83 billion dong and contributed more than 10 billion dong to the 
state budget. The total volume of this sector's trading 
activities accounts for more than 50 percent of all trading 
activities in the market. Of this figure, retail services 
account for 23 percent and wholesale services account for the 
remainder. This sector's corporations, enterprises, and stores 
have invested more than 50 billion dong to carry out capital 
construction projects, build mini-hotels, and modernize 
equipment in order to improve their performance.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, Jan. 6 KYODO -- A senior U.S. State 
Department official lashed out at Japanese trade negotiators 
Thursday [6 January], accusing them of being "quite rigid" in 
bilateral framework trade talks. 
  Undersecretary of State Joan Spero said Washington is 
disappointed with the progress in the four-month-old 
negotiations aimed at securing U.S. access to the automobile and 
other key market sectors in Japan. 
  Spero was particularly critical of Japanese resistance to 
U.S. proposals to use "quantitative indicators" as yardsticks to 
measure whether Japanese markets are as open to imports as other 
developed nations. 
  "I don't think this is something that is negotiable," Spero 
said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE and JIJI PRESS. 
  Spero, the top State Department official in charge of 
economic issues, gave the interview ahead of a trip to Japan on 
Friday for talks with Japanese officials on the framework 
negotiations. 
  Japanese and U.S. negotiators are committed to concluding 
the 
current phase of negotiations prior to a summit between Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on 
February 11. 
  "We don't want to settle for some cosmetic fix on February 
11th. We want to have a real change in this relationship," she 
said. She laid the blame for an apparent stalemate in the talks 
on Japanese negotiators, who she described as tough, rigid 
bargainers. 
  "It seems that in all areas our Japanese interlocutors are 
being quite rigid," Spero told a news conference earlier in the 
day. 
  The current negotiations, based on the so-called "framework" 
trade accord concluded last July, focuses on four key Japanese 
market areas of particular interest to U.S. firms. 
  In addition to increased auto and auto parts sales in Japan, 
the U.S. wants the Japanese Government to buy more foreign 
telecommunications and medical equipment and to allow foreign 
firms unrestricted access to the Japanese insurance market. 
  While the Tokyo Government has promised to make it easier 
for 
foreign firms to do business in Japan as part of a commitment to 
reduce Japan's trade surplus, Japanese officials have balked at 
using numerical figures to assess progress. 
  "They don't want to talk about measurement even though we 
agreed very clearly in our written document that we will discuss 
these indicators," Spero said, referring to a provision in the 
framework agreement for the use of objective indicators. 
  Spero said Japanese negotiators are particularly negative in 
talks on Japan's automobile market. 
  "They are totally resisting any serious dialogue in 
automotive and auto parts issues," she said. 
  Spero accused what she described as her "Japanese 
colleagues" 
of misrepresenting U.S. intentions on the framework talks. 
  "One of the things that our Japanese colleagues have been 
saying to you in the press, and you have been saying in your 
articles, is 'the U.S. wants another series of (market 
share-setting) semiconductor agreements.' I think this is 
disinformation," she said. 
  Spero said the United States is not asking for one single 
indicator but multiple benchmarks to show that foreign firms 
enjoy the same level of penetration in Japanese markets as in 
other developed countries. 
  "By any standard, Japan is not as open as the other 
developed 
market economies," Spero said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- The Forestry Agency on 
Friday [7 January] rebuffed complaints by a group of U.S. 
senators concerning Japan's policy on forestry product tariffs, 
saying that Japan's agreement under the Uruguay Round of market 
access talks to cut tariffs on such products by an average 30 
percent is in line with its previous agreement with Washington. 
  American media reports have said U.S. senators including Max 
Baucus sent letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa saying that Japan is infringing 
on a bilateral agreement to move toward a reciprocal total 
abolishment of tariffs on forestry products. 
  The agreement referred to was one reached in June 1990. The 
United States at the time requested that Japan cut tariffs by 
more than 33 percent on 51 selected items. 
  The senators are requesting that the issue be discussed when 
Hosokawa visits Clinton in February. But agency officials said 
the case is closed with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Japan has called on North 
Korea to hold talks to prepare for resuming stalled bilateral 
negotiations aimed at establishing diplomatic relations, a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday [7 January]. 
  Spokesman Terusuke Terada told a press conference that Japan 
has made the call to Pyongyang for a preparatory meeting. He 
declined to elaborate. 
  Later [as received] in the day, a top Foreign Ministry 
official said Japan has urged North Korea to hold preparatory 
negotiations to decide the timing and place for resuming talks 
on normalization of bilateral ties. 
  The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, indicated 
that Japan may again make the call when a third round of 
high-level talks between North Korea and the United States is 
held, since Pyongyang is currently placing more importance on 
talks with Washington than on anything else. 
  So far, Japan and North Korea have held eight rounds of 
negotiations on normalizing ties. The eighth round was held in 
November l992. 
  The negotiations stalled when North Korea walked out in 
protest at Japan's requests to confirm the safety of a Japanese 
woman Tokyo believes was abducted by North Korean agents. 
  The Japanese Government alleges the woman was forced to 
serve 
as a language teacher for Kim Hyon-hui, a North Korean agent 
responsible for the bombing of a Korean Air jetliner in 1987 
that killed all the 115 people aboard it.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa expressed concern Friday [7 January] about North 
Korea's suspected nuclear arms development and sought close 
contact with South Korea and the United States to remove the 
potential threat, a Foreign Ministry official said. 
  "Japan is deeply concerned about this issue," the official 
quoted Hosokawa as saying during a meeting with U.S. Senators 
Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar at his official residence. "But 
dialogue between the United States and North Korea seems to be 
going in a favorable direction, and we are closely watching its 
development," Hosokawa reportedly said. 
  Washington said Wednesday that Pyongyang has agreed to allow 
international inspections of all seven of its declared nuclear 
facilities. Hosokawa also spoke of the need for Tokyo's close 
contact with Seoul and Washington to get North Korea to erase 
international suspicions about a clandestine nuclear program, 
the official said in a briefing to reporters. 
  Nunn, who is chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services 
Committee, called Japan-U.S. security one of the most important 
issues in the world and said it must be further enhanced. 
  Hosokawa, echoing Nunn's view, reportedly vowed Tokyo's 
continued host nation support for U.S. forces in Japan, saying 
Japan wants to do everything it can in the field. 
  Earlier in the day, Nunn and Lugar met with Defense Agency 
Director General Kazuo Aichi 
  Nunn and Lugar, a senior member of the U.S. Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, arrived in Japan from Russia on Thursday 
for a three-day visit. They will leave for South Korea on 
Saturday.

  [Text] Kyoto, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Representatives of 
pro-Pyongyang and pro-Seoul Korean residents' organizations in 
Kyoto sipped tea together Friday [7 January] in a spirit of 
goodwill. 
  The reconciliation took place at the annual new year tea 
ceremony of the headquarters of the Urasenke School of Tea in 
Kyoto. 
  Kim Chae-ha, chairman of the Kyoto branch of the pro-Seoul 
Korean Residents Union of Japan (Mindan), and Kim Kwang-su, 
chairman of the Kyoto branch of the pro-Pyongyang General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan, (Chongnyon), shared 
the same tea bowl to welcome the new year. 
  Urasenke tea master Soshitsu Sen prepared and served the two 
Kims the thick, green tea in a special bowl lined with gold on 
the inside. Both Kims relaxed and smiled after the ceremony, 
saying they participated in it in a spirit of "partnership."

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Japan plans to step up 
international humanitarian relief activities based on its U.N. 
peacekeeping cooperation law to cooperate in solving problems of 
refugees in areas of conflict, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
indicated Friday [7 January]. 
  Hata told Sadako Ogata, United Nations high commissioner for 
refugees, that he wants to "positively consider" carrying out 
the activities based on the law, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  He made the remarks in response to Ogata's call for Japan to 
utilize the law in the humanitarian field to solve problems 
concerning refugees, the officials said. 
  Neither Hata nor Ogata specified the regions that might 
recieve such Japanese assistance, they said. 
  Tokyo is likely to study possible humanitarian assistance 
for 
the former Yugoslavia, such as in the medical field and in 
rescuing and repatriating refugees, after a government 
fact-finding team returns from the region. 
  The mission, which is to leave Japan later in the day, is to 
visit areas such as Zagreb, Skopje, Sarajevo and Belgrade. 
  The members are scheduled to meet Yasushi Akashi, head of 
the 
U.N. peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia, as well as 
other U.N. officials and government officials.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- A Japanese fact-finding 
mission left for the former Yugoslavia on Friday [7 January] to 
study possible Japanese contributions there, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. 
  The eight-member mission will visit places such as the 
Croatian capital of Zagreb, the besieged Bosnian capital of 
Sarajevo, the Serbian capital of Belgrade and Skopje in 
Macedonia before returning to Japan on January 17, the officials 
said. 
  The members will meet Yasushi Akashi, head of U.N. 
peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia, U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata, as well as other U.N. 
officials and government officials of Croatia, Macedonia and 
Slovenia, they said. 
  The Japanese team is headed by Shunji Yanai, director 
general 
of the ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, who played a key role 
in realizing Japan's legislation on cooperation in U.N. 
peacekeeping missions which enabled the Self-Defense Forces 
(SDF) to join U.N. operations in Cambodia in 1992. 
  Foreign Ministry officials have described the aim of the 
mission as simply to "grasp the local conditions" to study 
possible Japanese contributions, brushing aside speculation that 
the mission might pave the way for sending SDF there. 
  Akashi has repeatedly called for Japanese contribution to 
U.N. peacekeeping forces in the former yugoslavia. 
  Japanese officials have cited difficulties in sending SDF 
troops there because of the absence of a cease-fire agreement, 
unlike that in Cambodia. Japan is expected to send an assistant 
to support Akashi.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Japan need not drastically 
reduce its military strength owing to any changed circumstances 
on the world scene, Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi 
said Friday [7 January]. 
  Officials said aichi made the remarks in talks with U.S. 
Senators Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, who arrived Thursday for a 
three-day visit. 
  Queried by Nunn on an upcoming review of Japan's national 
defense program, Aichi was quoted as saying, "just because the 
situation has changed, that does not mean (Japan's military 
strength) should be drastically altered." 
  He said the strength of Japan's military is not intended to 
correspond to any particular external threat. 
  Officials said Nunn, who is chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, urged active Japanese commitment to United 
Nations peacekeeping activities to help offset U.S. costs. 
  Nunn called peacekeeping an important aspect of U.S.-Japan 
cooperation, they said. 
  Officials said Nunn also urged that Tokyo's host nation 
support for U.S. Forces in Japan be more "flexibly" spent on 
such things as repair of facilities. 
  Defense Facilities Administration Agency Head Ichiro 
Yoneyama 
replied that funds can be allocated under the existing framework 
for such large-scale projects as repairs to runways. 
  Nunn and Lugar, who is a senior member of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, will leave Tokyo on Saturday for South 
Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- The Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP] will submit censure motions in the House of Councillors 
against Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries Minister Eijiro Hata over Japan's decision to 
partially open its rice market, senior party officials said 
Thursday [6 January]. 
  The LDP decided Friday morning to submit the motions Friday 
evening, party officials said. 
  The party decided to exclude Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa 
from the motions, saying including him would have a "serious 
affect," the officials said. 
  The party officials said they decided to submit the censure 
motions because the two ministers violated Diet resolutions 
calling for a ban on foreign rice imports. 
  The two ministers gave deceptive answers to the Diet and 
failed to exert enough diplomatic effort, they said. 
  The government decided in December to end its decades-long 
ban on rice imports as part of the Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade talks and agreed to give foreign growers minimum access to 
Japan's rice market, importing 4 to 8 percent of its annual rice 
consumption over a six-year moratorium, starting in fiscal 1995. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news 
conference the two Hatas fulfilled their duties as ministers in 
charge of the Uruguay Round and therefore need not take the 
blame. 
  "Under the leadership of the prime minister, the government 
dealt with the issue, and both of the ministers also devoted all 
their energy to tackling the years-old formidable task," the top 
government spokesman said. 
  "In this regard, I see no reason for them to be censured," 
he 
noted.

  [Text] Matsue, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Sakigake, one of the seven 
parties in the ruling coalition, on Friday [7 January] became 
the first political party in Japan to open its membership to 
foreigners. 
  Atsushi Nishikoori, a Sakigake (Harbinger) member of the 
House of Representatives, told a press conference that the 
party's Shimane branch opened its membership to foreigners the 
same day. Other branches will follow the Shimane branch, he 
said. 
  Sakigake was founded last June by 10 disaffected members of 
the Liberal Democratic Party. Sakigake leader Masayoshi 
Takemura joined the coalition government of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa as the chief cabinet secretary last August. 
  It currently has 14 members in the 511-seat House of 
Representatives. 
  Nishikoori said at least 14 foreign residents in Shimane 
Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan side of western Honshu Island, 
have expressed interest in joining the party. It will accept 
foreigners who have lived in the prefecture for more than five 
years or who have a Japanese spouse and have lived in the 
prefecture for more than two years, if nominated by more than 
two party members. 
  Nishikoori said opening the party to members of all 
nationalities is an "appropriate" way to create a new party 
suited to the demands of the world community. "Based on the 
principle of equality, we will remove the obstacles one by one," 
he said. 
  Japan's two largest political parties, the LDP and the 
Social 
Democratic Party, stipulate that their members must be Japanese 
nationals. 
  A senior member of Zainichito, a group of Korean residents 
seeking the right to vote, said the Sakigake decision is 
"wonderful." 
  Yi Chin-mi said "They're probably just aiming to expand the 
number of party members, but we should use this as an 
opportunity to work for getting the vote, given that it isn't 
even known that foreigners in Japan don't have the right to 
vote."

  [Text] Naha, Jan. 7 KYODO -- The opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) will help enact political reform bills 
during the current extraordinary Diet session which is to close 
on January 29, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said Friday [7 
January]. 
  Mori, speaking at a lecture session in Naha, Okinawa 
Prefecture, said, "The party wants to finalize deliberations in 
the current Diet session after the government-proposed bills are 
revised to bring them nearer to the LDP-proposed ones." 
  He said the LDP will start compiling its own compromise plan 
on the bills early next week. 
  He cited three major modifications to be made to the 
government bills -- changes to the ratio of House of 
Representatives seats to be determined by direct and 
proportional election, to the controls on political funding of 
individual politicians, and to the electoral district basis for 
the proportional representation. 
  The government and the ruling coalition parties have sought 
274 single-seat districts and 226 seats chosen by proportional 
representation. 
  The LDP wanted a combination of 300 single-seat 
constituencies and 171 proportional representation. It also 
favored seats votes in the proportional representation counted 
on a prefectural basis. 
  Buth the LDP-sponsored political reform bills were voted 
down 
in the House of Representatives in November. 
  The ruling coalition has vowed to complete debate on 
political reform in the House of Councillors special committee 
by January 14 even if the LDP boycotts the session. 
  The government reform package cleared the lower house in 
mid-November but deliberations in the upper house stalled for 
over a month through late December due partly to the LDP's 
refusal to attend reform panel sessions.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- The government may have to 
promise the opposition to revise its package of political reform 
bills after they become law if it wants to get them passed by 
the Diet, a senior official of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
said Friday [7 January]. 
  "We may have to consider first pushing reform bills through 
in the current Diet session and then modifying the laws in the 
next session," said the official of the largest party in the 
coalition government, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
  He said the coalition has to "make a political promise" to 
the opposition on future amendments of the laws in return for 
securing passage of the bills in the current Diet sitting, which 
ends January 29. 
  The political reform measures won approval of the House of 
Representatives in mid-November and are pending in the House of 
Councillors. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has vowed to get the bills 
passed in the current extraordinary Diet term, but the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party is trying to prevent their 
passage. 
  The proposed reform legislation is intended to introduce a 
new system for lower house elections and tighten controls on 
campaign funding.

  [Text] Naha, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Yoshiro Mori, secretary 
general of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, on Friday [7 
January] called for a massive income tax reduction and 
criticized the government for delaying implementation of such a 
cut. 
  He did not refer to the precise scale of the proposed cut. 
  Mori told reporters that raising the consumption tax to make 
up for a shortfall of government revenues would have a "negative 
impact" on the economy's recuperation. 
  Mori said the issue of whether or not to raise the 
consumption tax from the present 3 percent could even lead to 
the destruction of the coalition government. The Social 
Democratic Party, the largest of ruling coalition parties, is 
against a consumption tax hike. 
  He also said a drastic easing or even a temporary freezing 
of 
land taxes and a zero interest rate on housing loans should be 
scrutinized as ways of stimulating slumbering business.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- The Home Affairs Ministry is 
seeking to end the tax holiday that life insurance companies 
enjoy on fees they charge for managing private pension funds, 
ministry officials said Friday [7 January]. 
  The proposal to tax such fees will be studied under fiscal 
1994 tax reform plan, but the officials say opposition is 
expected from the Finance Ministry and the Health and Welfare 
Ministry on the grounds that life insurance companies are facing 
a severe management environment. 
  The employees' pension fund system was created in 1967 and 
the government exempted from taxation the fees charged by the 
insurance companies for managing the funds. Home Affairs 
Ministry officials said the special treatment puts the national 
pension fund system at a disadvantage. 
  In addition, no tax exemption is allowed if the pension fund 
management is entrusted to trust banks, they said. The ministry 
calculates there will be an increase of tax revenues of some 1 
billion yen annually if the special tax holiday is abolished.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance on 
Friday [7 January] denied news reports that the ministry will 
study the possibility of abolishing the securities transaction 
tax as part of measures to get the economy out of the current 
recession. An official at the ministry's budget bureau said the 
ministry "has no such plans whatsoever." 
  The government is expected to come up with a fresh package 
of 
pump-priming steps later this month. 
  The NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, a major economic daily, reported 
in 
its Friday evening edition that the ruling coalition parties 
will consider removing the securities transaction tax. The 
newspaper's report pushed Tokyo stock prices sharply higher, 
with the Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues ending 
242.02 points higher at 18,124.01. 
  The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 
Finance Ministry will "act in line with recommendations made by 
the government's tax commission last November." 
  The advisory body suggested that the government should 
maintain the securities transaction tax "at least for the time 
being." There is no change in the ministry's policy of 
reviewing the tax and the capital gains tax "in the future" as 
suggested by the commission, said the official.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 7 KYODO -- "Karoshi" or death from 
overwork is closely related to Japanese labor practices which 
are characterized by conspicuously longer working hours than in 
other industrial countries, government researchers reported 
Friday [7 January]. This was the conclusion of a study on the 
causes of "karoshi" carried out by the Economic Research 
Institute of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). The report is 
expected to appear shortly in the agency's publication, THE 
ANALYSIS OF ECONOMY. 
  According to the study, Japanese workers' average annual 
working hours came to 2,124 hours in 1990, about 200 hours 
longer than those in the United States and Britain, and 400 to 
500 hours longer than workers in France and Germany. 
  Moreover, Japanese workers are believed to work an average 
1.5 hours daily of so-called "service overtime" or unrecorded 
and consequently unpaid overtime work. Most of the people whose 
deaths are suspected to be caused by fatigue from overwork had 
worked more than 3,000 hours a year, including overtime. 
  As of fiscal 1992, one in six Japanese male workers was 
reported to be working more than 3,100 hours a year, and 46 
percent of workers in a survey answered they are afraid that 
they could die from overwork, the researchers said. 
  Meanwhile, they said, the quality of work has become 
increasingly demanding and stressful due to new technologies 
being introduced in rapid succession. 
  "Long, intensive work is a main factor causing an increasing 
incidence of health-disorder complaints at Japan's 
workplaces...and the most drastic case is karoshi," the report 
says. 
  The researchers said people's sense of values, combined with 
the long-standing labor practices in Japan, tends to aggravate 
overwork. Individuals and corporations need to change their 
attitudes toward work in order to prevent overwork, they said. 
  They suggest the government should extend workers' accident 
compensation insurance to cover karoshi cases and introduce a 
new premium calculation method for the insurance based on the 
working hours at each workplace. 
  Higher premiums that employers would have to pay to the 
government for longer working hours would eventually persuade 
them to take some preventive measures to curb overwork, they 
said. 
  The phenomenon of karoshi was reported as early as in 1960 
when the nation's economy was expanding rapidly, and karoshi was 
recognized widely as a serious problem in the mid-1970s. 
  Karoshi is defined as death due to accumulated fatigue from 
overwork but it is not a recognized medical term and there are 
no official statistics on it. Its most common manifestation is 
in the form of sudden death from stroke or heart failure. 
  The researchers, however, said a group of lawyers has 
recorded 1,416 cases of inquiries in four years from June 1988 
from people looking for compensation for the deaths of their 
relatives from suspected overwork. 
  According to the researchers, most people would feel tired 
on 
the day following one when they worked more than 10 hours, and 
complaints of fatigue would sharply increase if they worked 
overtime of more than 40 hours a month.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Chong Pong-kil: </F>
"Direction of the Operation of So-Called State Affairs by a 
Political Impostor"] 
  [Text] According to South Korean broadcast reports on 6 
January, puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam held a so-called New Year 
news conference and babbled about the direction of the operation 
of so-called state affairs for the new year. However, this is 
mere gibberish that contains nothing new and is completely 
worthless. 
  Therefore, commenting on the New Year news conference by Kim 
Yong-sam, the Democratic Party, a South Korean opposition party, 
said: Even while saying that he would pursue 
internationalization and opening up, he failed to elaborate on 
concrete measures and lapsed into rosy optimism. This is very 
worrisome. He merely repeated the policies he had announced 
before the conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations. 
  During the news conference, traitor Kim Yong-sam said that 
he 
would continuously pursue change and reform and paid lip service 
to politics serving the convenience of people and clean 
politics. This is merely artifice to cheat the South Korean 
people and constitutes an intolerable mockery of people who 
demand new politics and new systems. 
  Even during the election campaign for the puppet presidency, 
traitor Kim Yong-sam loudly babbled about clean politics and 
politics where no money is necessary. However, nothing has 
changed in South Korea. 
  The reforms that the Kim Yong-sam ring have made were 
antipopular reforms which strengthened the puppet traitor's 
one-man dictatorship, deteriorated the economic crisis, and 
worsened people's livelihood. What the reforms gave South 
Korean people were bloody suppression using guns and bayonets 
and chronic hardships of life. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring, under the cloak of reform, exercised 
emergency arbitration power which the previous military 
dictators did not dare to invoke and brutally suppressed 
workers' labor disputes who called for the rights to existence. 
Worse still, they viciously cracked down on the righteous 
struggles of the South Korean people and students for 
independence, democracy, and reunification. 
  The rascals, ignoring the people's demand calling for 
abolition of the fascist-like National Security Law and 
suppressive agencies, including the Agency for National Security 
Planning, have not reformed them and, worse still, have stepped 
up fascist suppression by wielding them. 
  Again this time, traitor Kim Yong-sam vociferated that he 
would reorganize the law and systems. However this is nothing 
but a trick to further step up the fascist suppressive rule over 
the South Korean people. Traitor Kim Yong-sam's prattling about 
sharpening the international competitive edge by pressing ahead 
with the five-year plan for the new economy is also a shameless 
imposture. Due to the five-year plan for the new economy, the 
economy is in tatters as exports remain sluggish, the production 
rate continues to drop, and foreign debts increase, backfiring 
firms to go bankrupt. To make matters worse, farmers and 
agriculture lost ground and the catastrophic crisis in the South 
Korean economy has been deepened overall due to the Kim Yong-sam 
ring's rice market opening. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam admitted that our economy is suffering 
from hardening of the arteries in various places. At such a 
time, how can the advertisement on enhancing international 
competitiveness and so on get through to anyone? 
  What cannot be overlooked is that puppet traitor Kim 
Yong-sam 
came out with our nonexistent nuclear issue again this time. 
Speaking of our nuclear issue prattled about by traitor Kim 
Yong-sam, this is a byproduct of the antisocialist and 
anti-Republic maneuvers persistently pursued by the United 
States. It is the United States that came out with the 
suspicion of our nuclear development and which threatens us by 
actually bringing nuclear weapons onto the Korean peninsula. 
  Therefore, the nuclear issue in our country is an issue that 
must be resolved through DPRK-U.S. talks, not an issue into 
which the South Korean puppets should poke their noses. 
  As is known, in recent contacts, by displaying the spirit of 
mutual understanding and cooperation, the DPRK and the United 
States provided prospects for removing a series of obstacles in 
the way of DPRK-U.S. talks and fundamentally resolving the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Not only all the fellow 
countrymen but also the world welcome this. However, traitor 
Kim Yong-sam presumptuously babbled about the nuclear issue of 
the North and provoked us. This is what only the vicious 
betrayer who does not care about the destiny of the country and 
the nation can do. 
  Envious of the fact that opportunities had been provided for 
making progress in the DPRK-U.S. talks and that prospects had 
been provided for fundamentally resolving the nuclear issue, the 
puppet traitor made those absurd remarks in an insidious attempt 
to put a brake on this development at all costs and harm and 
crush [apsal] his fellow countrymen in collusion with 
international reactionaries. 
  Babbling about the so-called provocation, traitor Kim 
Yong-sam also said that he would see to modernize the puppet 
armed forces and that it would be good for him not to comment on 
the Team Spirit joint military exercise because it was a 
sensitive issue. He made these remarks with the same intent. 
  Facts show that traitor Kim Yong-sam has no will to realize 
reunification and intends to continuously pursue North-South 
confrontation this year. It is also proven that the civilian 
regime is so in appearance only and, in reality, is no different 
from any other preceding dictatorial regime. 
  One has no reason to watch the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime or 
expect something from it. Traitor Kim Yong-sam must know what 
consequences his traitorous remarks and deeds harming his fellow 
countrymen will bring and act with discretion.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
fascist clique recently threatened that the "labour-management 
disputes" will be "dealt with toughly by law" and "emergency 
arbitration power" will be invoked against workers' strikes even 
though they are legal. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says the labour 
movement in South Korea can by no means be a target of fascist 
suppression. 
  Noting that the workers' strikes to push their demands 
including wage hike are the exercise of their elementary rights 
for existence, the analyst continues: 
  When he was active in an opposition party, Kim Yong-sam 
stood 
by the side of the workers, joining them in strikes at their 
request. After climbing to power, however, he executed a swift 
volte-face and began brandishing the sword at the workers. How 
can such a person be called a human being? 
  Not much penetration is needed to see why the Kim Yong-sam 
fascist clique is threatening the workers with "tough 
counteraction" and "emergency arbitration power" from the 
beginning of the year. 
  It is foreseen that the workers' struggle against the puppet 
regime's flunkeyist and treacherous economic policy and 
anti-popular labour policy will grow fiercer in South Korea this 
year. Upset by this, the fascist clique schemes to check their 
struggle by threatening them at the point of the bayonet from 
the beginning of the year. 
  Bayonet-brandishing, however, is not almighty. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst says the more desperate the Kim 
Yong-sam fascist clique get in suppressing the people with 
bayonets, the faster it will precipitate the doom of the 
"civilian" regime.

<F P=106> [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] plans 
to increase significantly the number of inspection experts and 
send them to Pyongyang in order to restore the continuity of 
inspections, which was greatly damaged by the suspension of 
operation of monitoring equipment in North Korean nuclear 
facilities and by North Korea's refusal of inspections. 
  A relevant IAEA high-ranking official said that through 
overall inspections [chonmyon sachal], which will be resumed in 
the future, the IAEA plans to restore the damaged continuity of 
inspections of North Korea. Toward this end, it will send the 
inspection team to Pyongyang after adding three or four 
additional experts. 
  He stressed that the IAEA plans to send an inspection team 
of 
approximately seven experts to Pyongyang for the nuclear 
inspection of North Korea, which will be resumed in the future. 
He said he was not sure if North Korea would accept the seven 
experts because the IAEA has not received an official message 
from the North Korean side yet. He said, however, that the IAEA 
plans to discuss the issue with North Korea through 
consultations. 
  He stressed that the inspections must be regularly conducted 
in order to completely restore the continuity of inspections and 
he expressed the hope that North Korea will respond positively. 
He said that the inspection team, which is ready to go to North 
Korea now, is standing by in order to change monitoring 
equipment in North Korean nuclear facilities, including six 
monitoring cameras and over 40 pieces of sealing equipment 
[pongin changchi] and to check in detail the total stock of 
nuclear material that has not yet been examined.

<F P=106> [Interview with Khamla Keophithoun, economic attache of the </F>
Embassy of the Lao People's Democratic Republic in the PRC, by 
an unidentified reporter in Beijing; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Reporter] How are you, Mr. Khamla? First of 
all, we would like to thank you for granting us an interview. 
In 1993, China and Laos have continued to carry out 
restructuring and have made satisfactory achievements. 
Therefore, as the old year is ending and the new year 
approaching, could you please brief us on achievements of Laos 
in restructuring and in economic development in the past year? 
  [Khamla] [passage omitted] According to the announced 
figures, the GDP has increased by six percent. The total 
production of each sector can be categorized as follows: food 
supply production was 1,448,900 metric tons; agricultural 
production increased by 4.5 percent; industrial and handicraft 
production increased by 9.2 percent; electricity output 
increased by 17 percent; processed industrial products increased 
by 10 percent; and services increased by 6.9 percent. [passage 
omitted] 
  Goods transportion by land, water, air, and sea has been 
developed. The number of private enterprises and partnerships 
has increased rapidly, thus making the distribution of goods 
into every part of the country possible. The volume of goods 
transported has increased by eight percent, while the volume of 
goods in circulation increased by 10 percent compared to 1992. 
[passage omitted] 
  On the trade balance, in the past year the volume of goods 
in 
circulation in the local market increased by 10 percent. The 
total value of goods exported was U.S. $220 million. This 
represents a 34-percent increase from 1992 and four percent 
above the year's target. Total imports were valued at U.S. $385 
million, an increase of 13 percent. 
  Banking has been efficiently managed and the government was 
able to keep the amount of loans under control. At the same 
time, the exchange rates between the Lao kip currency and 
foreign currencies were stable. 
  A new mechanism have been introduced to finance. 
Specifically, efforts were made to clearly separate the two 
roles in management thus making the state financial system 
unified and centralized. This has contributed to the 
implementation of a mechanism that is in line with the open-door 
policy, the setting of a balanced budget, the establishment of a 
national treasury, and the improvement of tax collection 
methods. A number of major rules and regulations have been laid 
out to make the finance and budget managements gradually conform 
with the new mechanism. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] In 1993, China and Laos exchanged more 
friendship visits than in previous years, while economic and 
trade cooperation increased noticeably. Therefore, could you 
please brief us on this issue? What do think about economic and 
trade cooperation in the future? 
  [Khamla] We can say that both China and Laos in 1993 
exchanged more friendship visits than in any previous year. 
This is because Laos and China are close neighbors; the peoples 
of the two countries have enjoyed the traditional solidarity, 
friendship, and good relations since ancient times; their 
mountains, forests, and rivers are linked to each other; their 
weather and natural resources are also similar. All these are 
favorable factors for ties and cooperation. [passage omitted] 
  Over the past four to five years, economic and trade 
cooperation as well as border trade, have increased 
considerably. Trading has increased from only a few kinds of 
goods in the past to more than 300 at present. Two-way trade 
volume has increased from only US$5 million to US$6 million per 
annum in the past to US$30 million a year at present. 
  There have been economic, and science and technology 
cooperation projects carried out in various ways and means and 
participated in by several economic sectors. The process of 
cooperation involved the provision of gratis aid, interest-free 
or low-interest loans for construction of hydropower electric 
plants, or the development of agriculture, forestry, and the 
rural economy. 
  On cooperation in the expansion of industry or in mining 
exploration, many Chinese companies have been awarded contracts 
for the construction of roads, airfields, hydropower electric 
plants in the northern, central, and southern regions of Laos, 
with a combined total cost of more than US$60 million. 
  Over the past four years, the PRC has invested a total of 
US$21,914,000 in 34 projects in Laos. In 1993, the PRC invested 
in 17 projects worth more than US$13 million. 
  To enhance future economic and trade relations and 
cooperation, although both countries have had similar 
experiences, I believe each country has some unique qualities 
and different conditions and levels of development. Despite 
differences, both have similarities in many aspects, such as 
geographically, in natural resources, in labor, funding, science 
and technology, and in the lessons of socioeconomic development 
and other fields. 
  I believe that along with the relations and cooperation 
between the potential markets, Laos and China will be able to 
find basic sectors, projects, forms, and methods of cooperaton 
that can serve as strategies and key factors for firm and 
lasting cooperation. I believe both countries are jointly 
considering basic, lasting, and key cooperation projects in 
several fields. These are integrated agriculture; forestry; 
processing industry for export; hydropower; mining; geology; 
construction materials; communications and land, water and air 
transportation; and tourism. [passage omitted] 
  Our country is the country of peace, stability, and social 
order. Its location is important as the international community 
is interested in development projects in this region, some of 
which are the Golden Quadrangle development project; the project 
to link Asian transportation routes -- roads, railways, 
waterways; the Mekong River waterways transportation project 
from the watershed in Tibet to Vietnam. [passage omitted] 
  Trade and the economy have very important roles for 
Lao-Chinese ties and cooperation. In this regard, all concerned 
agencies of each side will have to make efforts not only to 
increase production but also to consider the natural resources 
of each country, as well as the trade balance. They will also 
have to take into account various main strategic projects, ways 
to increase prosperity, and international competition. For 
example, border provinces may cooperate in agricultural 
cultivation, animal husbandry, logging and timber processing, 
reforestation, mining, the expansion of processing industries, 
the renovation of transportation routes, and tourism development 
through various ways and means. Regarding capital, they may 
discuss loan procurement from different places for established 
projects so that they can be completed within a suitable 
time-frame. 
  With this concept, I fervently hope the organizations 
concerned, PRC businessmen and investors, as well as those from 
other friendly countries will intensify their cooperation with 
the LPDR to bring about real benefits and glorious success to 
all sides. [passage omitted]

  [Text] To sound out the Asean position on the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum, Thailand has proposed hosting 
a meeting of the Asean finance ministers two weeks before the 
meeting of Apec finance ministers, which is tentatively 
scheduled for April. 
  The site of the meeting is expected to be Phuket, where the 
Malaysian minister has informally expressed a willingness to go, 
according to an official who asked not to be named. 
  Prior to the meeting, Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin is 
likely to raise the financial aspect of the Apec forum at a 
meeting with US Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, during the 
latter's visit to Thailand from Jan 17-19. 
  Thailand will ask the Apec finance ministers to maintain the 
original objective of Apec, which is to act as a trade and 
investment consultative forum. Tharin is likely to suggest to 
his Apec counterparts that they discuss the latest global 
financial policy and also sort out the obstacles hindering world 
trade, and how to resolve these problems. 
  The US and some developed Apec countries earlier informally 
suggested the Apec finance ministers meet and discuss how to 
integrate the "harmonization system" and the customs code among 
the Asia-Pacific nations. The proposal was opposed by some Apec 
members on the grounds that the pace of cooperation might be too 
fast. 
  Tharin, meanwhile, said that he would put a double taxation 
treaty and financial liberalization high on his agenda during 
the upcoming meeting with his US counterpart. 
  Bangkok and Washington have failed to come to terms on the 
double taxation agreement for 20 years, and Tharin stated that 
he would accelerate the negotiations for the benefit of the two 
countries. 
  During Bentsen's visit, sources said that both sides are 
likely to discuss the two remaining points: the licensing fee 
and tax exemption for the international transportation business. 
  Bentsen is also expected to urge Bangkok to do more to bring 
down the barriers in the financial sector for the benefit of US 
business, but Tharin said: "Thailand would have to see the 
attitude of the US before elaborating on what to do next." 
  Apart from Thailand, Bentsen will go to China and Indonesia 
to boost US interests in Asia. 
  On the offensive front, Thailand is expected to inform the 
US 
treasury secretary that it plans to amend or revoke the 
bilateral Treaty of Amity and Economic Cooperation signed in 
1966. The treaty grants privileges to US citizens doing 
business in Thailand in the same way as Thais, and vice versa. 
The contentious issue in the treaty is the shareholding 
structure, which allows US investors to hold more than 25 per 
cent of local firms, a source said. 
  Thailand is the only Asean country which has signed such a 
treaty with the US, and Thai officials earlier expressed an 
intention to amend the treaty on the grounds that it is outdated 
and not of benefit to Thailand. 
  One official said that Thailand is likely to stand firm on 
the US request for financial liberalization, and will present 
its liberalization package to show the US the country's progress 
towards financial reform. Bangkok has often said that it will 
not do more, as the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks 
did not include agreements on trade in services.

  [Text] Narita, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Five Japanese women left 
behind in China at the end of World War II returned to Japan on 
Friday [7 January] and demanded permanent residency. 
  The five, who were among thousands of Japanese left behind 
in 
northeastern China in the chaos at the end of the war, were 
accommodated at a government facility for war-displaced Japanese 
in Tokorozawa, Saitama Prefecture, following their arrival at 
Narita Airport. 
  The five women from Heilongjiang Province in northeastern 
China have nobody to sponsor them in Japan and came to Japan at 
their own expense, Health and Welfare Ministry officials said. 
  The new arrivals, aged between 59 and 78, brought the total 
number of war-displaced Japanese women who have sought residency 
since September to 39. 
  A group of 12 Japanese women came to Japan on September 5, 
followed by a team of 17 women on November 26 and another group 
of five women on December 6. 
  The Japanese Government said last month it will accept some 
1,000 Japanese women left behind in China at the end of World 
War II if they express a wish to return to Japan. 
  Health and Welfare Ministry figures show there were 1,759 
war-displaced Japanese women in China as of the end of March 
last year, of whom some 1,000 are believed to want to return to 
Japan permanently.

  [Text] U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale made an 
unusual request to Isamu Miyazaki, president of the Daiwa 
General Research Institute, who was in charge of compiling a 
report while serving as acting chairman of the Economic Reform 
Research Council (a private advisory body for Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa) when the council drafted the report in 
December last year that the report specifically indicate Japan's 
plans to cut its trade surplus with the United States and 
Japan's efforts to expand domestic demand. This was disclosed on 
8 January. A member of the report draft committee said: 
"Bureaucrats and the United States were a major `barrier' to us 
when we compiled the report." He is implicitly admitting that 
the request from the U.S. ambassador was a "pressure" and it 
affected the report's contents. 
  The council, which was created by Prime Minister Hosokawa 
with the mandate to study ways to reform Japan's economic 
structure, submitted the report to the prime minister on 16 
December. 
  It is still unclear when Ambassador Mondale and Mr. Miyazaki 
met. According to an official familiar with the council, 
however, the U.S. Embassy asked for a "meeting between 
Ambassador Mondale and Mr. Miyazaki to discuss the report" when 
the council was about to compile it. According to the same 
official, they met at the president's office in the Daiwa 
General Research Institute located in Koto Ward, Tokyo. During 
the meeting, the U.S. ambassador is said to have asked Mr. 
Miyazaki to incorporate in the report numerical targets for 
cutting Japan's trade surplus with the United States. 
  As for the numerical targets, many council members from 
industries argued strongly that "the report should incorporate 
numerical targets for Japan in order to avoid pressure from 
European nations and the United States to further appreciate the 
yen. The council, however, decided not to incorporate the 
numerical targets in the report in the face of a fierce backlash 
from the Finance Ministry that spoke out against setting any 
macroeconomics targets." Nonetheless, the report calls for 
"Japan's aggressive efforts to cut its current account surplus 
fully and significantly in the midterm" and for an increase in 
the basic plan for public investment under which a total of 430 
trillion yen will be invested by the year 2000. As a result, 
the council compiled the report taking into account the U.S. 
ambassador's request. 
  Mr. Mondale succeeded Mr. Armacost as U.S. ambassador to 
Tokyo in September last year and he is former vice president and 
a big cheese in the United States. During the Japan-U.S. summit 
talks held in New York in late September last year, President 
Clinton told Prime Minister Hosokawa, "Ambassador Mondale is my 
partner who converses by telephone with me most frequently." 
The U.S. ambassador is believed to have made the request after 
conferring with the President.

  [Text] The idea of setting up a quadrilateral economic 
conference for promoting free trade has cropped up among Japan, 
the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The four countries have 
begun studying the idea with the Japanese Foreign Ministry 
playing a leading role. They are expected to hold the first 
working-level meeting as early as mid-1994. It is likely that 
the proposed conference will be in the form of an unrestricted, 
loose consultative organization to study issues such as 
quadrilateral cooperation on economic policies and what the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference ought to be 
like. 
  The idea is based on a report worked out in 1992 by the 
Japan-Mexico Committee Toward the 21st Century--which was 
established by the governments and private sectors of the two 
countries. Concrete details of the idea will be discussed from 
now on. The idea has been formulated with the enforcement of 
the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] taken into 
consideration. Moreover, there are concerns about the U.S. 
attitude of giving priority to bilateral talks other than 
multilateral talks when trying to solve trade issues. 
  The Japanese Government intends to make the quadrilateral 
conference a "stage for multilateral dialogue and consultations 
to enhance economic cooperation and study ways of dealing with 
trade disputes." However, the government has no intention of 
producing a free trade zone like NAFTA that could be 
discriminatory against nonmember nations. 
  As the first summit meeting of the APEC was held in November 
1993, cooperative relations within the Asia-Pacific region have 
strengthened. However, Japan and the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations (ASEAN) have expressed concern that NAFTA will 
lead to a bloc economy. Although Malaysia has proposed the idea 
of establishing the East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), the 
United States and other countries, which are excluded from the 
idea, have opposed it. In this way, discord still remains 
within APEC. 
  Because it is certain that Japan will play a leading role if 
the economic conference is established, the idea is likely to 
arouse the interest of neighboring countries.

  [Text] The DPRK (North Korea) has accepted international 
inspections of its seven nuclear sites and North-South dialogue 
as a result of progress in U.S.-North Korea talks on North 
Korea's suspected nuclear development. In response, Japan-North 
Korea normalization talks, which have been stalled, are expected 
to resume some time in February. 
  Japanese negotiators in charge of the normalization talks 
strongly believe that the Japan-North Korea normalization talks 
will be resumed before or after the third round of U.S.-North 
Korea high-level talks that are expected to be held in February. 
  Since the eighth round of talks, which were held in Beijing 
in November 1992, the Japan-North Korea normalization talks have 
not been held for over one year. The Japanese side has already 
asked the North Korean side to hold preliminary consultations to 
discuss procedures for resuming the normalization talks. 
  The North Korean side has yet to respond to the request from 
the Japanese side because of its position of giving priority to 
the U.S.-North Korea talks. 
  Hajime Fukada, chief of the Youth Bureau of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan (secretary general of the Dietmen's 
League for the Promotion of Japan-North Korea Friendship), 
visited North Korea earlier in January. The North Korean side 
told him that North Korea is willing to hold preliminary 
consultations with the Japanese side, giving the impression that 
North Korea has begun moving to resume normalization talks with 
Japan. 
  Mr. Fukuda visited North Korea at the invitation of Hwang 
Chang-yop, director of the International Department of the 
Workers' Party of Korea. During his stay in Pyongyang, he held 
talks with Mr. Hwang Chang-yop and Kim Yang-kon, deputy director 
of the International Department. North Korea's willingness to 
resume normalization talks may mean that it is fully prepared 
for the talks after overcoming a waver in the recent shakeup of 
the Workers' Party of Korea.

<F P=106> [Interview with Koji Watanabe, ambassador to Russia, by </F>
reporter Tsuneo Kitamura; place and date not given; first 
paragraph is SANKEI SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] The fact that ultranationalist forces made great 
advances in the recent election for the new Russian Federal 
Assembly was a great shock to Western nations. Depending on 
future political changes, Russia may become an "unstable factor 
in the world." Consequently, moves have been observed within CIS 
member states, East Europea, and among Western nations to 
reexamine their strategies toward Russia. We asked Koji 
Watanabe, newly appointed ambassador to Russia who will assume 
his new post in late January, about Japan's policy toward Russia 
with which there exists a territorial dispute. 
  [Kitamura] How do you evaluate the election results for the 
new Russian Federal Assembly? 
  [Watanabe] The results were quite unexpected. The emergence 
of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the ultranationalist leader of the 
Russian Liberal Democratic Party, and the fact that the 
reformists did not make sufficient efforts to communicate with 
the people, were factors leading to such an outcome. 
  [Kitamura] Could the results have any effect on Japanese 
policy toward Russia? 
  [Watanabe] I do not think Zhirinovskiy's "diplomatic 
arguments" will be reflected in the Russian Government's 
diplomatic policies. However, it is also certain the 
dissatisfaction of Russians who are suffering because of their 
living conditions and their nationalistic feelings are reflected 
in Zhirinovskiy's remarks. Therefore, we must be cautious about 
this. 
  [Kitamura] Could the results hamper progress in negotiations 
on the territorial issue? 
  [Watanabe] I cannot tell. When President Boris Yeltsin 
visited Japan last year, a basic framework for territorial talks 
was agreed on between the leaders of the two nations. What is 
important is to persistently negotiate within this framework to 
strive for concrete progress. 
  [Kitamura] Moves have been observed among Western nations on 
reexamining aid to Russia. What is your view on this? 
  [Watanabe] It is true some nations are on the alert, but 
basically there are two opinions. The first is that more active 
support should be provided to Russia, and the second is that a 
few changes should be made on how such aid should be provided. 
Japan maintains it should not change the basic policy on 
Russian aid which has been continued so far, provided President 
Yeltsin continue with his reform efforts. 
  [Kitamura] Voices have also been raised in Japan urging 
caution regarding aid to Russia at this time. How do you feel 
about this? 
  [Watanabe] It is very important, not only in terms of world 
peace but also for Japan as a neighboring country, that Russia 
develop into a stable and democratic nation. It is also of 
great significance for Japan to provide support toward such a 
goal together with other major industrialized nations. Of 
course, I also realize the importance of public support on this 
matter. 
  [Kitamura] What is your view on cooperation between Japan 
and Russia regarding security in the Asia-Pacific region? 
  [Watanabe] Although Russia's existence is very important for 
this region, we must discern Russia's moves in order to 
determine how we can actually cooperate with Russia, 
realistically speaking. After all, Russian politics is centered 
in Europe. 
  [Kitamura] Russia has sought Japanese aid concerning its 
dumping of radioactive waste at sea. What is your view on this? 
  [Watanabe] For its part, Japan must help Russia since 
bilateral relations would be seriously affected should such 
dumping reoccur. 
  [Kitamura] Are there any plans for Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to visit Russia? 
  [Watanabe] I have heard a new Russian cabinet will be 
inaugurated around 10 January. Vice ministerial-level meetings 
are to be held in January to prepare for Foreign Minister Hata's 
visit to Russia. I hope Prime Minister Hosokawa will also be 
able to visit Russia soon.

  [Text] The Governments of Japan and Russia have agreed in 
principle on Russia delaying for 10 years the repayment of 
official debt by Russia of $1 billion which was due by the end 
of 1993. The debt will be repaid over the next 10 years. 
  A formal protocol on the agreement will be signed in Moscow 
in January. Other major creditor nations like Germany, the 
United States, and France have already concluded similar 
agreements with Russia. With the agreement between Japan and 
Russia, the focus of attention will henceforth turn to the issue 
of what to do about the debt that is due in 1994, and 
full-fledged negotiations on it are expected to begin this 
month, primarily dealing with the debt due by around next March. 
  As far as the matter of accepting delayed payment on 
Russia's 
official debt which was due in 1993 is concerned, a general 
agreement was reached at a meeting of the major creditor nations 
(Paris Club) in April 1993. 
  Most of Russia's official debt to Japan is insurance money, 
and the remainder are loans from the Export and Import Bank of 
Japan. While the repayment will be made over the next 10 years, 
first five years will be accepted as a grace period. 
  Regarding Russia's official debt due in 1994, the creditor 
nations--Japan, the United States, and Europe--make it a 
condition to accept the delayed payment that the IMF and Russia 
arrive at an agreement on Russia's economic reform plans and 
that the IMF extend loans to Russia. But Russia's problem of 
fund shortage is only worsening, and there is no telling when 
the IMF will implement its second part of loans for economic 
system transition ($1.5 billion) or short-term relief loans 
($4.1 billion). 
  Consequently, there is now emerging among creditor nations a 
feeling that they should accept delayed payment only on $1-$2 
billion due by March or April. Their assumption is that in the 
meantime the Russian financial authorities will enforce 
money-tightening measures, and economic reform in the country 
will make progress.

  [Text] The government's 1994 general-account revenue and 
expenditure budget is expected to be set at a level of 74 
trillion yen. That will mean an increase of about 3 percent 
over the initial 1993 budget, and represent a higher annual 
growth rate than that for the 1993 budget. 
  But, in order to avoid issuing deficit-covering bonds, 
financial manipulations--like rolled-up repayment of loans from 
profits in the sale of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corporation (NTT) shares--will be made, and expenditure not 
contributing to new projects will have to increase. As such, it 
will be a de-facto "belt-tightening" budget which will in effect 
fall below the initial 1993 budget. The reason for this is the 
expected fall in tax revenue in the year; it is likely tax 
revenue will be less than 58 trillion yen. 
  The Finance Ministry hopes to raise expenses on public works 
projects while containing the total budget amount. The ministry 
also hopes that, in combination with a third 1993 supplementary 
budget, this one will stimulate the national economy. 
  The government and ruling coalition parties plan to carry 
out 
a large-scale income tax reduction retroactive to January 1994 
by revising the taxation system. Once a decision on tax 
reduction is made, the tax revenue estimate must be lowered by 
that much. But since government bonds will be issued to raise 
government revenue, the size of the general-account budget will 
not change much. The Finance Ministry will formulate the third 
1993 supplementary budget while formulating the 1994 budget. The 
ministry is considering increasing public works projects in the 
supplementary budget. It can be said the ministry in fact aims 
to boost the national economy by formulating the two budgets as 
one unit (a budget for 15 months). 
  What normally becomes a point of concern in formulating the 
revenue part of the general-account budget is the estimation of 
tax revenue. This fiscal year, because of the economic 
recession, the revenue from such sources as corporate tax has 
fallen. At the time of formulating the second supplementary 
budget, tax revenue amounted to only 55.68 trillion yen, falling 
short of the budgeted revenue by more than 5.6 trillion yen. 
Although tax revenue for fiscal 1994 will be estimated by using 
these figures as a base, the government is leaning toward 
ironing out differences of opinion on the basis of an idea to 
set an estimated economic growth rate in real terms at about 2.5 
percent. It is likely the growth rate will be about 4 percent 
even in nominal terms. Therefore, it seems that overall tax 
revenue will be only some 58 trillion yen. This is the lowest 
level since the 58,004 billion yen posted in fiscal 1990 as far 
as initial budgets are concerned. 
  Regarding revenue other than from taxes, national bonds will 
be issued to cover expenses related to public works projects. 
The government will also issue construction bonds, which will 
amount to a little more than 8.5 trillion yen, to cover 
occupancy expenses [setsubihi] and other costs. It is expected 
that nontax revenues, including Bank of Japan contributions, 
will amount to a little less than 3 trillion yen. 
  However, following the rolled-up repayment of the loans from 
profits in the sale of NTT shares, the government will issue 
additional construction bonds, which amount to a little less 
than 3.3 trillion yen. Moreover, repayments by municipalities 
will be appropriated in the budget as nontax revenues. 
Therefore, the size of the budget will expand by about 4.5 
trillion yen in total. Due to the shortage of financial 
resources, the rolled-up repayment of project loans from profits 
in the sale of NTT shares, will be used to secure the balance of 
amortization fund, which stops the withdrawal of fixed amount of 
payment from the general account. We can say that it is a 
desperate measure taken under the pressure of necessity to avoid 
deficit-financing government bond issues by issuing additional 
construction bonds. 
  The actual size of the general account, excluding this 
special primary factor, will be some 70 trillion yen, which is 
about 3 percent less than the fiscal 1993 general account. 
Previously, the size of the general account was smaller than 
that of the previous year only in 1956 (it was 0.8 percent less). 
  Regarding expenditures, the amount of grants from the 
national government to local governments [chiho kofuzei kofukin] 
designed to distribute a certain percent of tax revenues to 
local governments, will be a little less than 15 trillion yen as 
far as calculations on tax revenues are concerned. However, due 
to reimbursement of excessively paid local allocation tax and 
other reasons, the total amount of expenditures will be set at 
the 13 trillion yen level. Although the amount of roughly 
estimated budget request for amortization of government bonds, 
which is an expenditure for paying back national debts, is 16.58 
trillion yen, it will be kept down to about 15 trillion yen. 
Moreover, 1.54 trillion yen is needed to cover the revenue 
shortfall of fiscal 1992. 
  Therefore, it is necessary to keep down the growth rate of 
general expenditures to less than 41 trillion yen, which is a 
little more than the 2 percent growth of the previous year.

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] has begun studying a 
plan to increase taxes on tobacco and liquor. This is because 
the MOF has judged that since it plans to abolish additional tax 
on automobile acquisitions and to remove a special tax on 
business corporations as part of the pump-priming measures, it 
needs to cover the expected shortfall in tax revenue -- which is 
expected to be nearly 400 billion yen -- that will occur 
following implementation of the plan. A probable plan is to 
raise cigarette taxes by 1 yen per cigarette. However, the 
situation concerning economic pump-priming measures is a fluid 
one due to the difficulties in coordination on the cost of the 
income tax cuts. Moreover, industrial circles and consumers are 
expected to oppose the MOF plan. For this reason, the MOF 
intends to coordinate with the ruling coalition and other 
parties while watching the situation concerning the shortfall in 
estimated tax revenue. 
  At a request by the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry, the MOF intends to include the plan to lower the 
consumption tax on motor vehicles from the current 4.5 percent 
(which is the standard consumption tax of 3 percent plus an 
additional tax of 1.5 percent) to 3 percent, and to remove the 
(current 2.5 percent) special tax on business corporations in an 
economic pump-priming package which it will compile within this 
month. The MOF plans to raise the consumption tax to 7 percent 
in April 1995. It hopes that demand for automobiles and other 
products will increase in response to the proposed income tax 
cuts and change in tax rates, and this will help the economy 
escape from the current recession. 
  It is expected the drop in consumption tax on automobiles 
will push down the overall tax revenue by approximately 80 
billion yen and the abolition of the special tax on business 
corporations by 315 billion yen. Because an expected drop in 
tax revenue is serious in view of the economic recession, the 
MOF intends to make up for the fall by raising taxes on liquor 
and cigarettes, which are not daily commodities and will have 
little impact on the economy. 
  Since Japan Tobacco Inc. gave up its plan to list shares on 
the Tokyo Stock Exchange by the end of the fiscal 1993, the 
proposed hike in cigarette tax is not expected to affect its 
business profits as well as the listing issue. If the MOF's 
plan is implemented, this will be the first increase in 
cigarette tax since fiscal 1986 and the first increase in liquor 
tax since fiscal 1984.

  [Text] On 7 January, Tsutomu Hata, concurrently deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister, decided to appoint adviser 
for the foreign minister Hisashi Owada--who is former 
administrative vice minister for foreign affairs--to be 
ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Owada will succeed Yoshio 
Hatano, who has served nearly four years. Foreign Minister Hata 
decided to appoint Mr. Owada who has an experience as the former 
vice minister to the post because there is a great possibility 
that Japan will become a permanent member of the UN Security 
Council. Mr. Owada is father of the crown princess. 
Originally, there was a plan to appoint him as ambassador to 
the United States or ambassador to the UK. 
  Moreover, Foreign Minister Hata decided on the following 
personnel changes: Ambassador to Thailand Hiroaki Fujii will 
succeed Hiroshi Kitamura as ambassador to the UK; Consul-General 
in San Francisco Atsushi Tokinoya will succeed Yukio Sato as 
North American Affairs Bureau chief; Ambassador to the ROK 
Yutaka Kawashima will succeed Tadashi Ikeda as Asian Affairs 
Bureau chief; and Consul-General in Los Angeles Koichi Haraguchi 
will succeed Kazuo Ogura as Economic Affairs Bureau chief.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kagehide Kaku, director of the Research </F>
Statistics Bureau, Bank of Japan (BOJ), by unidentified KINYU 
ZAISEI JIJO reporter; place and date not given: "A Period of 
Adjustment to Asset Deflation That Has Resulted From the High 
Yen Burden; Development of a Horizontal Division of Labor and 
`Hollowing Out'"] 
  [Text] In addition to the unforeseen cold summer and 
long rains and the high yen in the original forecasts, the fact 
that the impact of asset deflation exceeded everyone's 
expectations is the reason a business recovery in the latter 
half of the fiscal year is in jeopardy. Even though adjustments 
in inventories appear finally complete, we cannot ascertain the 
period of recovery at present. Although in response domestically 
to the high yen, business continues to shift production 
overseas, the issue is one of creating new production and a 
demand for replacement. Although fiscal and financial policies 
have not changed, they have a truly limited effect, given asset 
deflation. The primary criterion for a business recovery is to 
reverse the mindset of business and households. 
<H5>  Higher Than Anticipated Asset Deflation </H5>
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Low growth in the last fiscal year that 
has continued into this one is certainly evident. What is the 
biggest factor putting in jeopardy the business recovery 
originally forecast for the latter half of the year? 
  [Kaku] Although the possibility of a latter-half recovery is 
not entirely out of the question, there is considerable risk 
that it will be forestalled. 
  I can point to two reasons. The first is an unforeseen 
factor 
which this spring added pressure to the slump and continued into 
summer. These were the external factors of a cold summer and 
long rains as well as a stricter policy vis-a-vis China, but 
even more than this has been the enormous impact of the high yen. 
  However, this is not all. There is also the possibility that 
the impact of asset deflation has exceeded expectations; in 
other words, we have miscalculated the location of the recovery 
launch pad. 
  A symbolic example is domestic sales of passenger cars which 
rose from January through March but which then fell. Of course, 
we knew when the January through March numbers became clear that 
they were artificial and had been brought on by unusual sales 
efforts by dealers and that the April through June figures would 
be different. The issue then is the degree to which the reaction 
to the downturn exceeded expectations, ran counter to then 
current perceptions, and made clear later that passenger car 
sales were no longer "carved in stone." 
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] With capital investment and individual 
consumption in the doldrums, to what extent do you see inventory 
adjustments continuing? 
  [Kaku] Although inventory adjustments have been sweeping, 
each progressed in its own way. Inventory adjustments in unit 
housing occurred the quickest, being completed by the end of the 
year before last. Although sales of condominium apartments have 
been the slowest, inventory adjustments in this category appear 
to have been completed about the beginning of this year. 
  On the other hand, the most prolonged adjustment seems to 
involve office buildings. Because there will still be building 
starts, recovery prospects are not established, given that 
demand continues to be soft. 
  Within this category is the inventory of durable goods and 
business equipment. I have the impression that these adjustments 
have all progressed satisfactorily. But, I don't know the clear 
turning point at which inventory adjustments will have 
progressed far enough. Judging by past patterns, I would not 
find it strange to learn we had already reached that turning 
point, but I couldn't specify when. 
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] It seems appropriate to believe that 
there are factors external to the business environment which are 
lengthening the business slump. 
  [Kaku] This is inconceivable in attacking the high yen. 
Still, the high yen should not be thought of as a sudden 
disaster. Rather, the Japanese economy should be thought of as 
surfacing an issue which it had kept contained until now. The 
Japanese economy shouldered the issue of converting to growth in 
the form of sustained leadership in domestic demand at the time 
of the high yen slump following the Plaza Accord in 1985. But, 
because the illusion was that there was expansion in domestic 
demand which perpetuated the bubble economy following that, the 
resolution of the issue was lost sight of. 
  This issue is now once again being pointed to. Moreover, 
unfortunately, the economy is having to bear the heavy burden of 
cleaning up of asset deflation. Therefore, we must once again 
respond to this issue but this time with a greater handicap than 
that experienced following the 1985 Plaza Accord. 
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] What is the reason for the large size of 
the high yen impact this time? 
  [Kaku] The timing of its occurrence is utterly different 
from 
the last time (about 1985). Although there were dark clouds on 
the horizon last time, this time the high yen arrived following 
a business recession that had lasted over two years. The 
strikingly lower earnings ratio compared to other industries of 
electronics and automobiles, the two strongest export 
industries, is the direct result of the high yen. 
  Additionally, in some industries the superior competitive 
strength of Japanese products in terms of quality, not to 
mention price, continues to be driven downward. For example, 
this becomes strikingly apparent for Japanese cars destined for 
the U.S. market when compared to U.S. cars. It is not as simple 
as blaming high prices as in the prior high yen period. That 
course is a dead end. 
  Still, overemphasizing the view that we have fallen victim 
to 
the high yen which is undermining the Japanese economy and that 
the high yen exceeds the true strength of the Japanese economy 
is incorrect. Such thinking is somehow full of contradictions. 
Supposing such a high yen, not only would exports almost totally 
disappear but foreign exchange would revert to a cheap yen in 
accordance with market principles. It is impossible for the high 
yen to continue endlessly. 
  Eventually, a yen which has gone too high will commonly be 
corrected based on market cognizance. But, if we look at the 
market over time and the type of response we expect to be there, 
such judgments are not always accurate. Because from time to 
time there are such opinions regarding the market, the fear is 
that the market will temporarily go too far. Therefore, there is 
nothing to say that the current level is absolutely rational. 
<H5>  The True Nature of the High Yen </H5>
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Business in reality is taking great 
pains 
in response to the high yen. 
  [Kaku] The response of business is not particularly a 
changed 
methodology, but merely an aggregation of basic efforts to 
switch to internal demand, stop exports, or shift to new and 
rationalized products. 
  The true issue with the high yen is that "Japanese wages 
have 
risen in terms of the U.S. dollar." The plusses and minuses of 
the high yen definitely stem from this. An advantage of the high 
yen is that purchasing power overseas increases because the 
value of the Japanese labor force is highly rated. If domestic 
margins were restored, imported goods could be bought cheaply, 
exclusive of overseas travel. On the other hand, one 
disadvantage is that when we think of the labor force as a cost, 
the cost of Japanese products goes up. 
  It makes sense that business not make use of things that are 
high priced. Basic policy is exhaustive on this point. 
Consequently, although business is moving the production base 
overseas or is importing parts, which is same as importing a 
labor force, the issue is whether or not this is inviting a 
withering of the domestic economy. 
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Is there fear of a "hollowing out of 
production?" 
  [Kaku] I suspect there is such fear. Nonetheless, although 
we 
hear such ugly phrases as the "hollowing out of production," 
this is advancing the horizontal division of labor, to put it 
another way. This is the natural outcome of the high yen, or to 
put it another way, we have the high yen because Japan has not 
developed a full response to this matter. The issue is whether 
to shift production overseas on a scale and with the speed to 
meet changing demands or to change industries to compensate for 
this domestically. It is reckless to try to restrain the 
evolution of "hollowing out" or the horizontal division of 
labor, which is altogether a different discussion. 
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] What do you think about the relationship 
between the high yen and domestic employment? 
  [Kaku] With unemployment rapidly increasing, this in reality 
is not now the issue. The growth rate in the number of employed 
is dropping but it is still growing. The issue is the fear that 
employment will emerge as a major topic in the near future. 
  Although in the long-term employment judgments made by 
business depend on how they forecast demand, that forecast 
itself is influenced just the same if stagnation in real demand 
drags out. In this sense, while the employment issue is 
axiomatic, trends in business conditions are the drivers. 
  In addition to our basic approach, we now must think anew 
the 
process that translates changes in the production structure and 
the issue of what to do about the Japanese employment system, 
which signifies lifetime employment. This has actually changed a 
bit. For example, the percentage of part-time employment has 
steadily increased. Because such changes in the employment 
situation will have to move forward anew from this point on, it 
may be reckless to consider at what pace and in what form. 
<H5>  There Is No Clear Answer </H5>
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Despite the lowest interest rates in 
history, demand is not growing. What do you think about the 
effectiveness of our financial policy? 
  [Kaku] To make the impact of deregulation clear, one needs 
to 
make comparisons with a "period when the discount was not 
lowered." Doing this is appropriate and gets us thoroughly 
comfortable with business earnings. Furthermore, although the 
lowering of interest rates is not a direct objective, the result 
should be a boost in stock prices. Although when actual 
investment activity is not clearly evident, we conclude that 
"financial policy is ineffective," but then looking at it in 
retrospect we find it was too effective. It is all the more 
deeply colored this way because the factor of asset deflation is 
involved this time. 
  If we get away from the general effects of financial policy 
and confine ourselves to the impact of the official discount 
rate, we find significant changes. Although we formerly had 
interest rates that were changed in accordance with the system 
or customary practice when the regulated official discount rate 
moved, now such interest rates are almost gone. In the final 
analysis, unlike the official discount rate before, the idea of 
a "regulated interest axis" has been almost totally lost, 
indicating a major policy judgment. In the final analysis, the 
effect of the announcement in the broad sense has been steadily 
purified. In this sense, even though the position of the 
official discount rate will change as deregulation of interest 
rates progresses, this is not to say that the position of 
financial policy or its effectiveness has changed. 
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] More than 20 trillion yen in public debt 
has been issued since last year. However, this still is not 
linked to private consumption. How about the effectiveness of 
public debt? 
  [Kaku] The extent of the "effectiveness of government fiscal 
policy" is calculated according to the size of the multiplier. 
What determines this are the expenditure trends of business and 
households. In the final analysis, the issue is whether the 
economy itself which receives money expended through fiscal 
policy immediately reuses it. 
  Now, because the overall outlook is bad, expenditure trends 
have dropped. For example, if you do construction, you will 
receive payment for it. However, if general construction does 
not buy new construction equipment with the construction fees it 
has received, or, if the laborers hired to do the construction 
work do not spend the wages they receive, the effectiveness of 
expanded government financing to boost business will be less 
effective. 
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] How can the disposition to spend be 
encouraged? 
  [Kaku] There is no clear answer. The disposition to spend is 
decided by the psychology of the economic entity. There is no 
good scheme for changing that psychology. 
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Are not deregulation and restoration of 
a 
high yen margin effective? 
  [Kaku] Deregulation will have an impact if we do it 
earnestly. On the other hand, restoration of the high yen margin 
is a weird phrase. The advantage of the high yen is that the yen 
base by which payment is made is lowered when importing and this 
occurs instantly. The problem is what this reverts to. Margin 
restoration is chiefly talk of changing that distribution. As 
soon as there is a way to change the distribution, the receiving 
economic entity may use this money. However, it makes no sense 
if it is not used. Therefore, if we do restore margins, we 
cannot say in general it will boost the economy. 
<H5>  Conditions for a Favorable Turn of Mind </H5>
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] Tax reform which would combine a 
decrease 
in the income tax with an increase in the consumption tax has 
surfaced. How do you see the impact of this on the business 
recovery? 
  [Kaku] It is very, very difficult. If a decrease in the 
income tax and an increase in the consumption tax had no impact 
on revenue, that is, if they were in revenue-neutral form, and 
they were enacted at the same time, I think that, whatever you 
say, they would have a negative impact on business conditions. 
  Although decreasing the income tax would increase income, it 
is best to use that money or to save it. A reduction in the 
income tax itself ought to be neutral regarding consumption 
tendencies. I think that if income taxes were definitely reduced 
there would be more spending because take-home pay would 
increase. But there would be no incentive to raise or lower the 
portion of the take-home pay used for consumption. 
  For example, say one's income is 100 yen and the income tax 
rate is 20, then his net income is 80 yen. If he sets his 
consumption rate in this case at 50 percent, then he would save 
40 yen and spend 40. Now, were we to reduce the income tax rate 
to 10 percent, the net take home pay would be 90 yen. However, 
with a fixed consumption rate, only 45 yen would then be used 
for consumption. With the first 40 yen in consumption becoming 
45, the increase in consumption would increase only because net 
pay increased. There would be no change in consumption tendency. 
  However, because the consumption tax depends on consumption, 
but clearly works as a restraint on consumption, in the final 
analysis, we must conclude that it works against consumption. 
Were we to enact a decrease in the income tax and an increase in 
the consumption tax in revenue-neutral form, I believe it would 
have a deflationary impact. 
  If we want this to have a positive impact on business 
conditions, we must put a bridge between tax decreases and 
increases. However, should a gap open up between the two, it 
would be natural for a deficit to develop between the two and 
therefore have a major impact on the fiscal balance. Therefore, 
there are definite tradeoffs in the case of tax increases versus 
decreases between fiscal balance and their impact on improving 
business conditions. This is a major issue. 
  Even having said this, I know of no other way to do it. 
Meanwhile, at some point we must tackle tax reform that will 
have a directly proportional correction unrelated to business 
conditions. Nonetheless, it is only natural that a perception 
emerge linking these two things. 
  [KINYU ZAISEI JIJO] The Japanese economy once experienced a 
high rate of economic growth, even reaching 10 percent. 
Following that, having survived the oil shock, we entered a 
period of stable growth at 4-5 percent. Do you not sense that we 
have now entered a third stage, which is a low rate of growth? 
  [Kaku] I don't know. Everyone agrees that a 5-percent 
average 
growth rate for the four-year period we are calling the "Heisei 
economy" is extraordinarily high. The growth rate for the period 
following the oil shock and preceding the "Heisei economy" did 
not achieve 5 percent. Although one can make various 
calculations regarding the growth rate, I don't think they 
reflect the true earnings. I think a larger issue is the fact 
that various business people are not increasing their demand. If 
everyone thinks this way, the result will be a lower growth 
rate. The major issue is how one should go about changing this 
thinking. It makes almost no sense to argue that the growth rate 
is such and such based on some abstract model.

<F P=106> [Keynote address by Shinyasu Hoshino, chairman of the </F>
National Institute for Research Advancement, at a symposium 
cosponsored by the Takugin Research Institute and EKONOMISUTO in 
Sapporo Grand Hotel, Sapporo City, on 8 September on the theme 
of "Japan's Perspective Toward the Year 2010"] 
  [Text] Recently, when viewing the tides of the world, I 
make it a point to think from angles represented by three words 
which all begin with "S." The first is "south" which implies the 
South-North issue. The second word is "speed." The realization 
of an information-oriented society will further progress, and in 
10 to 15 years from now all means of communications are expected 
to have about doubled their present speeds. The third word is, 
though its use is a little farfetched, "ethnicity" which, when 
transliterated, starts with "es" (S) (esnisity). There will be 
growing interest in the racial or community issue and in the 
so-called "nation state" question--to put it simply, the 
question of the nation. 
  First, as to the South-North issue, I think that this issue 
can also be subdivided into three "E's." They are "economy," 
"energy," and "environment." Harmonizing these three "E's" 
seems to be synonymous with resolving the issue of the "south," 
that is, developing countries, is it not? On the global 
environment problem as well, the following questions are raised: 
Which regions will succeed in development? Will they be advanced 
countries or developing countries? Another question is: Who will 
use fossil fuel? These are the questions which the South-North 
issue involves. 
  I may receive your scolding by saying this, but I think that 
it is proper to use atomic power, to which safety is important, 
as long as its users are advanced countries. 
  As to the second "S" or speed, this aspect can also be 
divided into two "N's." They are "network" and "neighbors." 
These days we frequently hear people talk about downsizing and 
in this connection, as the use of networks expands, the need 
for, say, libraries will dwindle. It also becomes possible to 
obtain copies directly from the U.S. Harvard University library. 
  Referring to neighbors, it is frequently said that borders 
may disappear in the economy-related sector for example. There 
were no economic interchanges on the Sea of Japan in the era of 
the East-West cold war, but exchanges will be carried out 
vigorously through the Sea of Japan in the future. 
<H5>  Harmony Between Nation and Individuals </H5>
  As to the third category "ethnicity," it can further be 
divided into three "H's." The first is "human rights" or 
individual rights. Perhaps, the world will change in such a way 
that each individual will become its center. The second is 
"history." The nation states were formed in modern times, and it 
was after the start of the 20th century that the nation states 
bent their minds on economic issues and began to mention the 
importance of full employment. A nation takes care of its people 
by providing conveniences; however, it is not the nation that 
furnishes them with affluence. Instead, each individual of the 
nation must pursue affluence on his or her own. The most typical 
example of this pursuit is a racial movement. Herein lies the 
reason for the independence of Czechs and Slovaks in 
Czechoslovakia. 
  Racial problems are rare in Japan, and on this score I think 
that they are rather linked to the doctrine of well-being, 
thereby becoming arguments for the decentralization of 
administrative power. 
  Concerning the third point, "harmony," I think that how to 
harmonize relations among the state, the community, and each 
individual will assume importance from now. Such are the 
fundamental tides of the world, and I believe that amid them we 
are now at a period of adjustment. 
  I say that the year 1990 marked the end of World War III. 
That was the year when the cold war ended. The settlement of 
issues ensuing from the termination of this war will require 
very large energies, but when I consider the global distribution 
of economic influences in the future, I believe that the future 
will still be the tripolar era formed by Japan, the United 
States, and the EC nations. Perhaps, regional relations among 
countries surrounding these tripolar forces will increasingly be 
deepened. World War III has ended, and so there will probably no 
need for the present veto-bound Security Council which we began 
to have when World War II ended. It will be necessary to fully 
review the UN organization itself. 
<H5>  So Good That They Would Like To Live in... </H5>
  The foregoing is an outline of the world direction, but 
under 
these circumstance what will become of Japan? I would like to 
view this question also from three points. 
  First, we should build a beautiful national land. I think 
that Japan's future will largely depend on whether we can build 
a national land which is so good that even foreigners would like 
to come and live in Japan. When I visit Europe and see such 
scenes as red roofs, white walls, and potted flowers hanging in 
each house, I feel like living there--though not for life--at 
least two or three years. The estimation of a region or a 
national land will be decided by whether visitors from around 
the world feel like residing there, will it not? 
  Second, what about becoming a "middle power" in the sense of 
restraining ourselves? Of late, our country is frequently called 
an economic superpower, but Japan does not need to become a 
"superpower" at all. I believe that it will be good enough for 
Japan to be a middle power. I think that the recent change of 
regime has provided a chance to animate discussions about the 
state. From a long-term viewpoint, the form of state we choose 
will be a great issue. However, Japan will ruin itself if it 
loses its status as a technology-based nation. And future 
thriving businesses in Japan will be interface industries which 
connect different sectors, will they not? Materials are 
connected by distribution, and funds by banking. What connects 
techniques is research. 
  Last, I think that the decentralization of administrative 
power is necessary for building a beautiful national land as 
well. I propose that local areas be given more authority in the 
utilization of land. 
  What about repealing the Agricultural Promotion Act and the 
Town Planning and Zoning Act and enforcing a space maintenance 
law like one in Germany? This law provides for a formula under 
which the assembly of each local public body designs programs 
for the utilization of land while the head of each local public 
body enforces them. This formula, when followed, makes it 
possible to create a town of red-roofed houses if its members 
all say they like the red roof. 
  Moreover, we will have an aging society from now. It is each 
locality that sustains such a society in a real sense. This has 
thus far been the job of the nation and the family in terms of 
social security. However, support by the family has now reached 
its limit. A helping hand is needed in every resperct, but such 
a thing is the job of each locality rather than of the nation. 
In this sense as well, the decentralization of administrative 
power has become important.

<F P=106> [Discussion by Shinyasu Hoshino, chairman of the National </F>
Institute for Research Advancement; Hiroko Ota, Osaka University 
associate professor; Naobumi Ishiguro, chairman of the board of 
directors of the Takugin Research Institute; and Koji Oguni, 
EKONOMISUTO editor in chief; at symposium cosponsored by the 
Takugin Research Institute and EKONOMISUTO in Sapporo Grand 
Hotel, Sapporo City, on 8 September on the theme of "Japan's 
Perspective Toward the Year 2010"] 
  [Text] Now Is a Turning Point 
  [Oguni] First, I would like to begin this discussion by 
having Ms. Ota and Mr. Ishiguro give their impressions as to Mr. 
Hoshino's keynote speech. 
  [Ota] I felt that after all we were at a turning point. I 
would like to add two important points which we will have to 
experience by the year 2010 in the economic field. 
  First, domestically, our productivity has a large dual 
structure. The productivity of manufacturing industries is very 
high, but that of agriculture, banking, services, and 
distribution is low, and this is pushing prices upward. As long 
as this situation continues, it will be difficult to build a 
beautiful national land as mentioned by Mr. Hoshino. In order to 
remove this dual structure, it is first necessary to ease 
regulation. This will compel us to shift from our past emphasis 
on equality of outcome to emphasis on equality of opportunity. 
The cozy, doing-business-side-by-side structure which has thus 
far maintained Japan's stability will be subjected to a 
weeding-out process amid the market principle. 
  The other point is a change in the working mode in this 
connection. The cost-reduction competition based on the 
conventional formula of quick sales at small profits has now 
reached its limit. On the other hand, there are intensifying 
demands by workers for shorter working hours, and an era of 
labor force shortages will come. Because of the inevitable need 
to raise per capita productivity, the system of additional wages 
for overtime work and that of the lifelong employment will 
collapse. 
  [Ishiguro] I agree almost entirely with what Mr. Hoshino 
said. However, as to the aging society issue he mentioned, I 
think that a more serious problem is rather the trend of 
declining births. I somewhat feel that the year 2010 will mark a 
turning point at which the population begins to decrease. 
  Those born around 1950 now make up the largest segment of 
population. They will retire in huge numbers in about 17 or 18 
years. In addition, women's childbearing is expected to decrease 
at a very rapid pace. I think that the errors in population 
forecasts by the Ministry of Health and Welfare are indeed 
shameful. The ministry always overestimates in its forecasts. 
The birthrate is 1.53 children at present, but about three or 
four years ago, the rate for this year was estimated at 1.8 
children. 
  Another point is the centralization of administrative power 
or the issue of one-party rule by the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP]. It appears that those issues now face a period of 
sweeping adjustments. All want to work with large enterprises, 
and things are converging only into Tokyo. All these cannot be 
blamed on the central government, but we have chosen them on our 
own. We wanted to put our children in private tutorial schools, 
send them to the University of Tokyo, and have them work at 
central government offices, major banks, or large enterprises. 
We sought such things in the belief that they would unmistakably 
bring us happiness. And we have attained these things. However, 
we are now beginning to cast suspicious eyes on them. 
  [Oguni] Mr. Hoshino, do you have any opinion to give 
regarding the comments made by these two? 
  [Hoshino] Concerning the aging society, Mr. Ishiguro said 
that the declining birth rate was a very important problem. I, 
too, think that the decline in births is a very important 
subject. Nevertheless, the process of women becoming liberated 
is a good thing, is it not? Productivity of the male society has 
reached its limit in a sense. By women's participation, there 
may arise a difference in productivity from now. The declining 
birth rate will continue for some time, but after the passage of 
such an era, Japan may develop into a country like Sweden. The 
question is how we should consider such a course of development. 
Perhaps, for about 20 years to come the declining birth rate 
will deepen, and the aging of society will further intensify 
accordingly. 
<H5>  New Industries To Be Nurtured in Localities </H5>
  [Oguni] I think that it is a common recognition that we have 
now come to a great turning point with various issues. In such a 
situation, you are all saying that we may find a solution or a 
direction for our future course in the decentralization of 
administrative power. In this context, I would like to shift our 
discussion to why administrative power should be decentralized. 
  [Ishiguro] The decentralization of administrative power is 
not a question of yesterday. What we now call the Provisional 
Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform, which 
functioned during the Ikeda cabinet with then Mitsui Bank (now 
Sakura Bank) President Kiichiro Sato as its central figure, also 
contended that it was important to decentralize administrative 
power. 
  Thirty years later, there was the second Provisional Council 
for the Promotion of Administrative Reform, led by Mr. Toshio 
Doko during the Nakasone cabinet. Mr. Doko succeeded in bringing 
the government-run NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corporation], etc. into the hand of the private sector. However, 
nothing has been attempted up to date in shifting power from 
central to local quarters. 
  Concentrating everything on Tokyo--as seen in the unipolar 
convergence of things into Tokyo, the centralization of 
administrative power, the one-party rule by the LDP, and all 
huge enterprises, huge banks, and huge newspaper companies 
having their main offices in Tokyo--has been an extremely 
advantageous policy for Japan's growth and efficiency. However, 
with the passage of some 40 years under this policy, all the 
people have begun to think twice about this position. We now 
stand at the crossroads in this regard. 
  There is an auto parts manufacturing company named Dynacs in 
Chitose that produces 60 percent of Japan's automobile clutch 
disks. In the old days, all auto parts company had different 
affiliations like affiliations with Toyota or Nissan, and they 
were, under the keiretsu system, ruled by major firms in all 
aspects such as personnel affairs, capital relationships, and 
distributions. However, nowadays Nissan or Toyota would be 
unable to exist if it followed this practice. Such a brilliant 
industrial firm exists in Hokkaido as well. And the earning 
power of this kind of enterprise has now become much greater. 
When such an industrial change is effected, the unipolar 
convergence of things into Tokyo will also change. 
  [Oguni] The conventional system has become inefficient, and 
the minds of people now seek affluence. However, Japan's 
potential growth rate is no longer very high. 
  [Ota] To be sure, the economic growth rate will become lower 
for the long-term. One thing we do not know at present is what 
industry will become Japan's driving force now. What we need 
most at present is to nurture future excellent companies. I 
think that perhaps, the knowledge-intensive industry will become 
Japan's driving force in the future. However, it is believed 
that a capacity to generate new things will not grow under the 
present Tokyo circumstances where people suffer from accumulated 
stress caused by their endurance of harsh commuting conditions. 
I think that capacity will probably grow in circumstances where 
there is culture, broad space, and greenery, and where it is 
possible to activate human brains to a greater extent. 
  At any rate, it will be necessary to ease regulation and 
thoroughly reduce control so that newer things can be generated 
and that localities can nurture new industries and improve 
living circumstances by means of their own independent 
strategies. And under these conditions, they also need to 
discuss a federal system in earnest. There is no country with as 
much economic power as ours that is enforcing the centralization 
of administrative power. In addition, I would like to mention 
three points which I am now considering with regard to the 
decentralization of administrative power. 
  First, I think that the work of decentralizing 
administrative 
power in Hokkaido should begin with the position that Hokkaido 
no longer needs the Hokkaido Development Agency. When people 
discuss decentralization of administrative power, their 
arguments should also include how to resolve the issue of 
revenue sources. They cannot bring up only favorable aspects in 
their debate. 
  Second, the more decentralization deepens, the more that 
local strategies are needed. How should Hokkaido be dealt with? 
The strategy related to this question is most called for, is it 
not? 
  Third, the need for strategies for all of Japan is also 
being 
called for along with the decentralization of administrative 
power. When the economic growth rate falls, public works are 
scattered in local areas to remove the income gap. Debate is 
necessary on the order of priority to be given to these 
localities. 
<H5>  Abolish Construction and Transport Ministries </H5>
  [Oguni] To carry our discussion a step forward, let us move 
to the question of which work we have to touch first 
strategically. Mr. Hoshino suspected that the question of land 
utilization would emerge as a point of discussion. What 
arguments are now being made in Kasumigaseki [government office 
quarters in Tokyo]? 
  [Hoshino] The centralization of administrative power proved 
to be a quicker means for repairing war damage and improving 
rivers in the postwar period on the basis of uniform standards. 
It was a kind of planned economy. However, the people have 
become fed up with this. So respective local public bodies have 
begun shaping various designs in this regard. 
  I know only partial instances, but as for the way the 
current 
subsidy administration is working, it is collecting good 
examples from local areas, and to have those examples followed 
across the nation, it is asking, for instance, Kyushu to begin 
the same projects that were sucessfully carried out in Hokkaido. 
If so, it would be better that local areas themselves assume the 
whole work directly. There is no need at all to go through the 
filter of Kasumigaseki. 
  The ability of local planners has increased markedly of 
late. 
This is an age in which the people directly make things they 
want most at nearby places, is it not? I think that this is the 
real form of decentralizing administrative power. 
  However, it should be the last phase to entrust revenue 
sources to local areas. Entrusting the use of land should 
precede it. This is because subsidies are generally appendant to 
the utilization of land. When decision-makers on land use are 
reversed, those who assume the subsidy administration are also 
reversed subsequently. Touching the issue of the tax allocated 
to local governments is the next step. Otherwise, small cities, 
towns, and villages will instantly find themselves in an impasse. 
  [Ishiguro] I think that the land issue Mr. Hoshino mentioned 
represents a big proposition. In a sense, it seems that the 
issue of decentralizing administrative power will not be 
resolved smoothly unless we change our position drastically. 
  If we mean business, we had better abolish the Construction 
and Transport Ministries and transfer all of their authority to 
localities. There will be no way of giving such authority to the 
central government again, because it no longer has those organs. 
What the central government requires by all means are the 
Foreign Ministry, the Defense Agency, the Economic Planning 
Agency. 
  At present, people think that tax earnings in Tokyo are 
distributed to localities, but will this be true? Local 
residents should be armed theoretically. For example, the 
Kojimachi Tax Office, which takes in the largest amount of 
national taxes, collects over 2 trillion yen. Tokyo alone 
collects 35 percent of total national taxes. Should these tax 
earnings belong only to Tokyo? No, they should not. Payments are 
made there simply because main company offices are located 
there. These earnings should be divided correctly. 
  The mayor of Izumo City in Shimane Prefecture, Tetsundo 
Iwakuni, says: Old folks send their children to colleges in 
Tokyo and remit 1.5 million yen for their living expenses every 
year. The children do not return to Shimane and work in Tokyo 
for 30 years. The old folks remain in Shimane, and their burden 
falls on Shimane Prefecture. As his remarks suggest, it is no 
wonder that the lion's share is taken by Tokyo, while localities 
are placed "in the red" by accommodating only those old folks 
left behind. I hope that such losses will be compensated 
accurately. I say this because it is localities that brought up 
the children. According to a computation, localities suffer 
losses amounting to 12 trillion yen each year. They need to have 
these losses compensated. 
  As for Hokkaido, it does not need to obtain compensations 
because its losses and gains are about the same. However, some 
say that Hokkaido is not earning enough tax income to take up 
its share of the tax burden which the whole of Japan must bear. 
This may be true. No correct estimates are available in this 
respect, but I think that we still have to make considerable 
efforts in this regard. 
  Moreover, I would like to take an issue with government 
offices' stance that there can be no mistakes. Once they begin a 
thing, even if they find it wrong halfway, they take dozens of 
years to rectify it. This erroneous stance seems to be traceable 
to a notion that government offices are not allowed to make a 
mistake. Furthermore, the prices of government-procured 
commodities are too high. For example, compared with France, the 
per kilometer cost of the Shinkansen [bullet train] Line is 10 
times that of the French TGV Line. The cost of Japan's public 
roads is three times as high. As for buildings like hotels, the 
per tsubo [3.954 square yards] costs stand around 1 million yen 
in Tokyo as against 300,000 yen in New York. This is partly 
ascribed to controls. When it comes to the question of controls, 
we are apt to instantly refer only to agricultural products and 
rice, but in fact many Japanese commodities are subjected to 
control. 
  [Oguni] People seem to share the view that all this should 
be 
changed drastically. However, the problem lies after this common 
perception. What comes next is the question of who on earth can 
make the change in what form. 
  [Ota] I think that as drastic measures there are the 
adoption 
of a federal system and the transfer of the capital city. For 
the time being, however, it is, after all, necessary to 
thoroughly ease regulations as a midterm program. I strongly 
hope that voices will be raised from local areas in this regard. 
For example, I wonder why localities have not voiced their 
support for the land value tax. Raising the land value tax means 
raising the cost of undertakings in places such as Tokyo where 
land prices are high. When the land value tax goes up, extra 
undertakings will spread to localities as they cannot be carried 
out in Tokyo. 
  Another point is that it is important whether cooperation is 
possible among autonomous bodies. It is important whether they 
can formulate laterally oriented programs. Let us take up the 
traffic system for instance: Various inconveniences are caused 
because the Transport and Construction Ministries act 
separately. Cooperation between roads and railways is not 
smooth. Vertically oriented programs represent ideas of the 
supply side, while laterally oriented programs are ideas of the 
demand side. It is simple to abolish the national ministries and 
agencies, but as a precondition for decentralizing 
administrative power, it is desirable that certain regions 
containing several cities or prefectures will work out their own 
programs. If such moves arise spontaneously from localities, I 
think that the groundwork for the decentralization of 
administrative power will be getting solid. 
<H5>  Turn Sapporo Into City for International Conventions </H5>
  [Oguni] Well, last, I would like to hear your ideas as to 
what should be done for the benefit of Hokkaido. 
  [Hoshino] Regarding Hokkaido, I think that it would be good 
if the vicinity of Sapporo were turned into a city for 
international conventions, that is, a city like Geneva. On the 
other hand, Obihiro is a agricultural zone. It is desirable to 
have a beautiful area where an international city and an 
agricultural zone coexist. 
  At present, Singapore is a city for international 
conventions 
in Asia. There is no other city that is fit for holding 
international conferences. As is seen in the visits to Niseko 
and Tomamu [both areas in Hokkaido] by rich people in Southeast 
Asia for pleasure which is developing now, because of its 
climate and natural features, Hokkaido will be considered very 
exotic and interesting for people in Asia. In addition, visitors 
from around the world will not only attend international 
meetings; before they leave they will unfailingly see the sights 
of nearby cities. I think that the scenery of the rural area 
around Obihiro will strike those Southeast Asian visitors with 
wonder. 
  In this sense as well, it would be better to further deepen 
the consciousness that Hokkaido is our northernmost zone. It is 
situated around 40 degrees north latitude. It will turn into a 
crossroads where guests come from the south in endless 
succession. It will thus become a city for international 
conventions. This is the dream I have. 
  [Ota] It is not natural features and rich humanity alone 
that 
form local attractions. If it is, so-called local attractions 
are nothing but slight variations of things in large cities. I 
think that Hokkaido must have its own unique 
attractions--attractions that exist only in its locality. If 
people in Hokkaido find and know Hokkaido's attractions, I 
believe that Hokkaido has plenty of room for further development. 
  One attraction I feel to Hokkaido is its fondness for 
newness. The people there are free of odd prejudices and they 
are liberal. They are magnanimous and broad-minded in their 
receptiveness to heterogeneity. However, I hear that the process 
of stiffening and fixation has gradually begun in Hokkaido as 
well. I hope Hokkaido will remain a place that always gives 
birth to new things. I strongly hope that excellent future 
companies will be nurtured in Hokkaido. 
  [Ishiguro] We have heard two panelists express their 
affection for Hokkaido. 
  Present Hokkaido residents were polled about what towns they 
would like to live in. Sapporo ranked first. Over 90 percent of 
the respondents said that they would like to live in Sapporo. 
Ranking last was Shinjuku-ku with about 4 percent naming it. 
  The reasons why Tokyo is not good are: first, it has no 
natural surroundings; second, it is hard to own a house in the 
city; and third, Tokyo lacks flexibility in terms of time as 
well as mentality. Nevertheless, half the respondents said that 
they liked Tokyo. Why? It is because the city is full of fun. 
It is fun to work there and also relax there. It is an enjoyable 
place intellectually as well. Hokkaido is mildly enjoyable as a 
place to work and enjoy oneself. As to recreation in particular, 
one can enjoy golfing and skiing instantly. The largest problem 
is the lack of intellectual fun. This is important. I want 
Hokkaido University to work hard to this end. 
  Mr. Hoshino talked about making an international city, and 
in 
this regard Hokkaido residents should think more about the 
significance of Chitose Airport. The new Kansai Airport is 
totally hopeless. It costs too much and does not have domestic 
flights. It costs 10 times more than Chitose Airport. Yet the 
Transport Ministry will take sides with the new Kansai Airport 
unless we keep a sharp watch on the ministry's moves. This is 
because its officials are stationed there. We must maintain our 
sharp watch with a determination not to tolerate unfairness. 
  Last, I would like to touch on the issue of moving the 
capital. Many places including Tochigi, Sendai, Osaka, and Kyoto 
are now making activities to induce the authorities to set up 
the new capital in their areas, but I think that when the 
capital is transferred to a new area, the area should be 
independent from the prefecture it has belonged to. It should 
become something like Washington, D.C. The area should be 
considered a common district for 47 cities and prefectures and 
separated from its former prefecture. Otherwise, another Tokyo 
will be created again.

  [Text] Japanese automakers are groping in the dark for the 
right stance to take on development. Unable to read market 
changes, the new cars introduced after making thorough 
preparations are even doing poorly. The Tokyo Motor Show that 
will open on the 23d will symbolize the distress of the Japanese 
automakers. 
  The Tokyo Motor Show has welcomed its 30th anniversary; 352 
companies from 15 nations will participate and more than 2 
million people are expected to attend, making it the world's 
largest motor show, but this time the feeling of a gala festival 
will not exist for Japanese automakers. 
  Change From Elegance to Plain Concept Cars. All Firms 
Talk of "the Future Being in Practicality" 
  According to an executive at Mazda, whose concept car 
exhibition consisted of only one hydrogen engine car, the aim of 
the show was "to have people see as many cars for sale on the 
market as possible and tie that to sales." This idea was held in 
common with other companies as well. Says Yutaka Kume, Nissan 
Motor Chairman, the Motor Show has gone from a festival of dream 
cars abundantly endowed with the latest technology to an 
"opportunity for restoring new car sales." A serious slump in 
sales is threatening to significantly alter the purpose of the 
show. 
  However, even the idea of an opportunity to expand sales 
could end in failure if things stay as they are. Behind that is 
the change in consumer needs. Honda Motor Company Vice President 
Hiroyuki Yoshino puts it as follows: "Previously the car was the 
personification of dreams. However, the domestic market has 
entered a mature period, and there are increasing numbers of 
consumers who clearly think of the car as a tool the way people 
do in Europe and the United States." Customers will no longer go 
along with the idea up to now of making cars higher performance, 
comfortable, and elegant. 
  The "plainness" of all the company concept cars exhibited at 
the Motor Show was the manifestation of trying to anticipate 
this change in needs. Up to and including the previous show (in 
1991), numerous concept cars were displayed with the latest 
technologies, novel styling, and competing dazzling elegance, 
but this time such qualities were completely subdued. 
  Instead, what stood out were concept cars that used gasoline 
substitutes and which stressed the single point of practicality. 
Among the latter were two cars exhibited by Toyota Motor and 
Nissan based on the absolutely identical idea of "having 
interior space rivaling that of a large car, but with the car 
size and fuel consumption of a small car." 
  The pudgy appearance could not be called attractive even as 
an empty compliment, but the two companies both insist that "in 
the future this type of thoroughly rationalized car will become 
mainstream." 
  However, the true feelings of Japanese automakers do not 
welcome such a change. Inexpensive, compact, and practical were 
once characteristics of Japanese cars, but that is no longer the 
case. Since size increased and every conceivable type of new 
technology continued to be piled on during the bubble period, 
cars are no longer either inexpensive or compact. It is pointed 
out that they are excessively equipped and it has also become 
doubtful whether they are practical. 
  Price Difference Between U.S. Cars: Severe Cost 
Reductions Make Development Teams Feel Powerless 
  In January 1994 Chrysler will introduce the Japanese car 
killer "Neon," the focus of much attention, into the North 
American market. It is expected that the minimum price of this 
small passenger car will be about $9,000. A passenger car with 
engine displacement of 2,000 cc, its price at about 1 million 
yen defies the conventional wisdom of the Japanese automakers. 
Such things as power windows, and other equipment not regarded 
very highly by small car customers have been decidedly cut out, 
and it is said that, compared to a Japanese car of the same 
class, it has reduced the total number of parts by 10 percent. 
  There are critics, such as Honda President Nobuhiko 
Kawamoto, 
who says, "The Neon is a car solely in earnest pursuit of 
affordability. It will be necessary to monitor the situation a 
bit longer to make an accurate assessment of its reliability, 
among other things." One thing for certain, however, is that it 
has placed a big gap between the Japanese makers and the Big 
Three in terms of price competitiveness. 
  Lamenting his own company's disposition toward high costs, 
Nissan President Yoshifumi Tsuji says, "No matter how hard we 
try, a car under 1.5 million yen will not generate a surplus. It 
is like producing it merely to maintain the plant's rate of 
operation." Fixed costs such as personnel expenses and repayment 
expenses which soared during the bubble period have become 
encumbrances, and their constitution is such that they cannot 
turn a profit just by the manufacture of inexpensive cars. 
  Of course, they are desperately trying to cut costs by doing 
things like using parts in common with other companies and value 
analysis (VA), but just trying to reduce prices by an 
accumulation of small devices naturally has limitations. 
Confronted by the double punch of the strong yen and the sudden 
change in the Big Three's way of making cars aggravates a 
feeling of ineffectiveness of efforts to reduce costs in units 
of sen [1/10 of a yen]. 
  The drop in morale of the development teams is also a big 
problem. Recently, most of the new cars put on sale had to 
undergo a sudden price revision in the course of development. 
This is due to the need to hold down the sales price even a 
little amid the strengthening cost orientation of consumers. For 
this reason, at the time that development work gained 
considerable ground, they were ordered to use parts in common 
with other models and eliminate equipment. A technician at one 
manufacturer says, "Because top managers say this thing or that 
thing is unnecessary or wasteful, there is a great deal of 
dissatisfaction in development." 
  "Sales Change Just by Appearance. Are Consumers Really 
Emphasizing Practicality?" 
  Companies are also becoming shocked when unit sales drop 
radically once the new car effect dissipates several months 
after the beginning of sales, and this is amplifying the 
bewilderment of development teams. 
  In August Toyota did a minor change to its luxury passenger 
car "Crown," but within the industry there were many who 
described it as "virtually a full model change." Ordinarily, a 
minor change is confined to small alterations such as making 
improvements to parts, the addition of variations, etc. However, 
the Crown received major modifications. 
  It received the "major surgery" of having its front grille, 
bumper, and rear area remodeled so that its rounded styling was 
returned to a sharper cornered version that is closer to the 
older type of Crown. 
  The Crown has been one of Toyota's moneymakers, ranking 
right 
alongside the "Mark II." However, going into this year, its 
sales performance dropped to far less than the monthly target of 
17,000 units, and continued to be extreme sluggish at a monthly 
average of just over 9,000 units. The old angular style Crown 
maintained a respectable level of sales even when it was at the 
end of its model period. Therefore, Toyota decided to bring it 
closer to the old style which had enjoyed such a favorable 
reception. 
  September sales had recovered to just over 14,000 units, so 
the situation has improved, but the analysis of an executive at 
a rival maker is that "this is evidence that even Toyota, which 
is hailed as the representative of the `market in' type firm, 
has started having difficulty getting a handle on the current 
market." 
  The same sort of phenomenon can be seen with Nissan's top 
luxury car "Infiniti Q45." In a minor change in June, a grille 
was newly installed in front. As a result, unit sales which had 
dropped at one point to about 80 per month increased suddenly to 
699 units (in September). 
  The Infiniti has been using the rare grilleless appearance 
as 
a point of appeal to consumers as a luxury car. However, with 
the extremely sluggish sales, it changed its tune. Even though 
sales may increase, the distress will not diminish. One company 
official complains that "for sales to change this much just by 
changing the appearance, one loses confidence in whether 
consumers now are really valuing practicality." 
  Sales of Honda's "Domani," the small passenger car it began 
selling in November 1992, are also lethargic at about half the 
monthly sales target of 3,000 units. The Domani was the first 
small car in Japan to offer a driver's side air bag as standard 
equipment in an appeal to safety considerations. However, Vice 
President Yoshino recognizes the mistaken reading of the market, 
saying, "Many customers say they don't need air bags and that if 
the car's price could be reduced by the cost of the air bags 
they would buy it." 
  Firms understand the direction of change in the market 
viewed 
in the long term toward inexpensive and practicality, but are 
unable to get a reading of the speed of that change. Moreover, 
they have developed an excessively high-cost constitution to be 
able to respond to change. That state of affairs has caused 
Japanese automakers to lose confidence and is causing them to 
stray off course. 
  Nissan and Mazda have fallen into deficit and there are 
rumors that even Toyota will have an operating deficit in the 
coming first half, so all firms are suffering from rapidly 
worsening earnings. Because it is a climate that does not permit 
failure, new car development will be forced to strengthen its 
protective stance. 
  This motor show will be opened in a state of unprecedented 
distress. Will the festival that extolls the future of 
automobiles ironically become a stage where "the curtain will be 
closed on dreams"?

  [Text] The government has decided to establish a 
third-party "Committee on Promotion of Administrative Reform" 
(tentative name) as a nucleus to promote administrative reform, 
mainly through deregulation. The committee will be authorized 
to give advice to the prime minister and ministries and 
agencies. At the strong request of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, the Management and Coordination Agency [MCA] and other 
government offices have been preparing for the committee's 
establishment. The government will include the decision in an 
administrative reform action plan (administrative reform 
outlines) for fiscal 1994, which is expected to be approved at a 
cabinet meeting before the end of January. At the same time, it 
will submit a bill to establish the committee to the next 
ordinary Diet session. Besides monitoring the progress of 
deregulation, the committee will carry out the major task of 
studying enactment of an information disclosure law. The 
government will also include a plan to work out by the end of 
the year guidelines for decentralization of political power -- a 
basic policy to promote decentralization -- in the action plan. 
  As an organ to promote administrative reform, the government 
earlier decided to inaugurate the "Administrative Reform 
Promotion Headquarters" by mid-January. Prime Minister Hosokawa 
will serve as head, and the chief cabinet secretary and MCA 
director general as deputy heads in the headquarters, which will 
be composed of cabinet members and the Fair Trade Commission 
chairman. The aforementioned committee will work as an advisory 
organ to the headquarters and as a watchdog, as proposed by the 
Provisional Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform 
[Provisional Council] and the Economic Reform Research Council 
(chaired by Gaishi Hiraiwa). 
  The committee's major tasks will be devising an action 
program to promote deregulation, monitoring the progress of 
deregulation, and drawing up a bill on the disclosure of 
information. The committee will be established in accordance 
with Article 8 of the National Administrative Formation Law 
[name as published], and will fall under direct control of the 
prime minister. It will comprise intellectuals from the private 
sector. 
  The Provisional Council is authorized only to submit reports 
and opinions when asked by the prime minister. Because of its 
limited power, the Provisional Council is helpless against 
bureaucrats. Therefore, the government plans to give more power 
to the administrative reform promotion committee. It will 
clearly state in the bill on establishment of the committee: 
"The committee is authorized to give advice to the prime 
minister and to each cabinet minister." It will also give the 
committee the right to investigate ministries and agencies, 
local governments, and corporations with special status so it 
will be able to promote active investigation and discussion. 
  The government hopes the committee will be a body similar to 
the Japan National Railway Reconstruction Committee and the 
Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission. To enable the 
committee to make decisions quickly, the government intends to 
form it with three to seven members. The choice of committee 
members will be decided with approval of the Diet. So far, the 
government has not decided on how many members it should select 
from what sectors. 
  The outlines of decentralization will be worked out by the 
end of the year based on the administrative reform report 
released last October. However, it is uncertain whether the 
government will be able to include a plan, proposed in the 
report, to enact a "basic decentralization law" in the outlines 
in defiance of strong opposition from ministries and agencies.

  [Text] Firmly resolving to form an alliance with Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], headed by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, 
on 31 December Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa (representative 
of the Japan New Party [JNP]) began to study the possibility of 
establishing a joint group within the House of Representatives 
or a united consultative body to discuss election cooperation 
and other issues. He did so in anticipation of reorganization of 
the political environment, which is expected to gather momentum 
immediately following approval of the political reform bills. 
Hosokawa ultimately aims to create a political system led by 
"two major parties" by forming a political power base strong 
enough to compete with the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. 
Hosokawa envisions yet another new party to be formed from the 
merger of the Japan New Party, Sakigake [Harbinger] (led by 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura), and Shinseito at 
some point in the future. It will be different from the 
"moderate multiparty system" of the past. Most JNP members and 
some Sakigake members have already expressed support for 
Hosokawa's plan. The prime minister's plan will inevitably have 
a major impact on changes in the political scene. Since the 
potential parties' merger is related to developments at Diet 
deliberations on political reform bills, each party is likely to 
be quite active when the extraordinary Diet session resumes. 
  The prime minister met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura 
and other members of Sakigake at a Tokyo hotel on the evening of 
31 December and exchanged opinions on political realignment, 
including Hosokawa's idea on the merger of the three parties. 
  Reportedly, Takemura disapproved of the idea. However, it is 
said that under Hosokawa's plan, the JNP and Sakigake would 
merge as early as February after the end of the extraordinary 
Diet session, according to sources close to Hosokawa; Shinseito 
would join them later. With the JNP acting as an intermediary, 
the three parties would form a nucleus later to be joined by 
Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party, LDP members who desire 
political reform, and liberal reform-minded members of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. 
  Hosokawa devised these plans for the following reasons: 1) 
it 
is necessary to consolidate a power base within the ruling 
coalition parties to prevent the LDP from regaining power; 2) 
because both the JNP and Shinseito are new conservative parties, 
there are few differences between the parties' political ideas 
and basic policies; and 3) if the heiretsu formula of combining 
single-seat constituencies and proportional representation is 
introduced to the lower house as a result of the Diet's passage 
of the political reform bills, the change will likely initiate a 
shift toward a system featuring two large parties. 
  In this connection, a senior official of the JNP who is 
close 
associate of the prime minister clearly stated the following in 
a YOMIURI SHIMBUN interview on 31 December: "It appears that 
the prime minister is planning for an eventual grand merger 
among all ruling coalition parties. However, for the time being 
at least, he wants his party to merge with Shinseito." 
  When he met with Satsuki Eda, director general of the 
Environment Agency, on 26 December, the prime minister 
reportedly touched on the issue of reorganizing the political 
world, saying: "A merger with Sakigake only is too small. I am 
of the view that a greater change will occur." Eda plans to 
actively take part in such a reorganization. 
  The JNP and Shinseito formed a joint group within the House 
of Representatives (which was also joined by the Democratic 
Reform Parliamentary Group) in November 1993. It is said that 
they formed the group in "preparation for a future merger," 
(according to a senior JNP official). 
  However, Takemura makes a clear distinction between his 
party 
and the Shinseito-Komeito bloc. Therefore, it is said that he 
aims to form a coalition with LDP members who want political 
reform and other groups after the merger with the JNP. 
Reportedly, Takemura is wary of the idea of forming an alliance 
with Shinseito. 
  From this stance, Takemura tried to reconcile different 
views 
at the 31 December meeting. The prime minister explained his 
position: "It does not mean that I promised to form a merger 
with Shinseito. However, as Sakigake and the JNP unite together, 
we must give due consideration to Shinseito." In this way, he 
explained his view of tackling the issue of merging Sakigake and 
JNP while keeping an eye on the possibility of forming a merger 
with Shinseito. 
  However, Takemura and some Sakigake members are not 
favorably 
disposed toward Shinseito, which played a central role in LDP 
politics. Some JNP members disagree with Shinseito's political 
style as well. It can be said that the prime minister's concept 
will have a subtle impact on the issue of the merger between the 
JNP and Sakigake.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shusei Tanaka, special assistant to the </F>
prime minister, by Yutaka Iwasa, chief editor of SHUKAN 
DAIYAMONDO: "Purposeful Deregulation Will Prove Effective in 
Stimulating Business Activity"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Iwasa] Almost 100 days have passed since you were 
appointed special assistant to the prime minister. Has there 
been any change in the situation since you assumed the post? 
  [Tanaka] As you know, the new government was organized to 
carry out political reform. Today, however, three major reforms 
-- administrative reform and economic reform in addition to 
political reform -- are all targets of the new government. This 
may be regarded as a new development, and not a change in the 
situation over the past 100 days. If you seriously tackle 
political reform, you will inevitably be involved in 
administrative and economic reform. Take deregulation as an 
example. There are so many government regulations in Japan, it 
creates a climate in which money politics can take root. 
Political reform aims to change such a climate. Also, needless 
to say, deregulation is the major target of administrative 
reform. Besides, Japan should clear this obstacle in order to 
grow into a new economic community. Thus, it has become 
necessary for Japan to realize these three fundamental reforms. 
Though, at first, the new government was organized as a 
specialty store to pursue political reform, it was inevitable 
that the government would increase the number of targets. We 
are hoping that, as the prime minister said in his statement, 
fundamental reforms will pave the way for a better and more 
substantial quality of life in Japan. 
<H3>  The Problem Is Whether Business Recovery and the Three 
Reforms Can Be Realized Concurrently </H3>
  [Iwasa] But is it not very difficult to break down the 
existing relationship among politicians, bureaucrats, and 
businessmen? 
  [Tanaka] There are particular circumstances in any time 
which automatically show us the right direction. However, it 
really is a very hard task to break down the existing structure. 
  [Iwasa] At present, the problems of political and economic 
reform are being mixed up in the public discussion. What is 
your understanding of current business conditions? 
  [Tanaka] I understand conditions are very serious. Last 
year, I was a staff member of the Economic Planning Agency and 
had the opportunity to attend lectures on business conditions. 
What I learned from the lectures was totally different from 
what I had learned in the electoral districts and what I heard 
from taxicab drivers. Therefore, it should be frankly admitted 
there was a misjudgment on the part of the government. At 
present we are in a serious economic condition we have never 
before experienced and the prime minister shares the sense of 
crisis. 
  [Iwasa] The government has to improve business conditions 
and pass the political reform package at the same time, does it 
not? 
  [Tanaka] That is the main problem. If we want to secure 
long-lasting prosperity for Japan, we must, by all means 
necessary, reorganize the existing economic community. We 
should liberalize the economic community, which has been trussed 
up by regulations, and create an environment for new businesses. 
It is also necessary to frame a system under which the fruit of 
economic growth is returned to the people who make a steady 
living. The Economic Reform Study Group is currently studying 
hard to create such an economic community. The process is like 
a surgical operation on Japan's economy. We need to have basic 
physical strength in order to undergo the operation. It is 
impossible to perform an operation when you are physically weak, 
suffering from a cold or stomach upset. Our target for the time 
being, therefore, is to build up our physical strength in order 
to be strong enough to undergo this vital operation. It is true 
that the necessity of performing the operation and the necessity 
of recovering physical strength tend to be mixed up in public 
discussion. Put another way, our problem at the moment is 
deciding what measures must be taken to prevent our community 
from collapsing at the base. 
  [Iwasa] The only action possible seems to be an increase in 
government disbursements, does it not? 
  [Tanaka] I am sorry, but I am not in a position to talk 
about that. 
  [Iwasa] We are already in a period of deflation, a 
process which might be accelerated if further deregulation is 
carried out. In the short-term, this situation may be 
accompanied by some pain. 
  [Tanaka] It is certain that, for the time being, 
deregulation will have a negative influence on employment. It 
is also true that drastic deregulation does produce surplus 
manpower. Therefore, I am saying that we need to build up 
physical strength to meet the situation. Another point is that 
there are certain deregulatory measures which show an immediate 
effect in stimulating business conditions. 
  The government is to organize a deregulation promotion 
headquarters. I hope its promotion does not involve merely 
enumerating the regulations to be removed. Deregulation should 
be effected for various purposes, even if it deals with only one 
regulation. 
  Take as an example housing construction, which is a key 
industry in the Japanese economy. If we want to further 
activate this sector, it is necessary to further reduce 
construction costs. If we want to promote deregulation with the 
focus on cutting construction costs, it will not be enough to 
simply remove the regulations under the jurisdiction of the 
Ministry of Construction. We must also remove the regulations 
under the control of the Ministry of Transport to ease the 
transportation of materials, and regulations controlled by the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry to help import 
those materials. If we carry out deregulation for a purpose and 
look beyond simply the extent of accountability of ministries 
and agencies, we may be able to link deregulation to measures to 
stimulate business conditions. If we remove regulations placed 
on newcomers, it also becomes possible to create an investment 
opportunity for enterprises and industries which are now facing 
deadlock. 
<H5>  The Prime Minister, as `Political Leader' Must Be Helped </H5>
  [Iwasa] Is it true that deregulation based on political 
policy is desirable? 
  [Tanaka] According to our interim report, the deregulation 
promotion plan is to have a five-year lifetime. In principle, 
economic regulations will be removed during this period. 
However, if the five-year period proves insufficient, we will 
try another five-year period. 
  [Iwasa] But people are hoping to see deregulation come into 
effect as early as the latter half of 1994. 
  [Tanaka] Actually, we have not even organized a deregulation 
promotion headquarters. Yet, I appreciate your comment as 
information. However, I am sure that, this time, the new 
headquarters will operate powerfully in a quite different way 
from past operations. 
  [Iwasa] Will the new headquarters make it clear to the 
general public that it will deal with the government offices 
very differently from the past? 
  [Tanaka] Regulations are the authority and assets of 
government offices. There is a limit, therefore, to the extent 
that they will contribute their assets voluntarily. Political 
leadership will be required to secure the cooperation of 
government offices in removing regulations. I feel the 
promotion headquarters must play the role of leader. As for me, 
I am to play an unpopular role (laughter). 
  [Iwasa] Will there be strong opposition from staff members 
of government offices? 
  [Tanaka] Contrary to our belief, people within the 
administration are developing a deeper understanding. They have 
a sense of crisis. They are afraid the Japanese economy may be 
pushed more and more into a corner if nothing is done, and that 
only those industries which are protected by regulations will be 
left in Japan. 
  Therefore, since the start of the Hosokawa administration, 
we 
have been surprised by the number of regulations reported to us 
by each government office which they believe should be removed. 
Also, when we were trying to correct the difference between 
foreign and domestic prices, I had a telephone call from the 
director of the Price Bureau at the Economic Planning Agency who 
told me he was glad to see more items reported by government 
offices than he had expected. 
  You can be sure though, that there are still regulations 
which could usefully be cut. The role of the Prime Minister's 
Office is to further promote deregulation. Hosokawa is fully 
prepared to play his part. 
  [Iwasa] How about Prime Minister Hosokawa's leadership? 
  [Tanaka] Hosokawa seems to be a prime minister chosen by the 
times. Though at first I opposed the decision to give him the 
post, now I feel he may have been destined to become prime 
minister. 
  [Iwasa] The prime minister is supposed to be the leader of 
the administration and, at the same time, the political leader. 
In which of these two areas do you think you are best able to 
assist the prime minister? 
  [Tanaka] In the world of politics, there is a large 
emotional element to the job in which you are required to 
coordinate people's feeling, or to persuade people. Therefore, 
as leader of the administration, the prime minister will every 
day experience a serious sense of conflict within himself. The 
conflict becomes even more serious when you feel the existing 
systems do not work. I could well understand his feelings while 
working for him. So my best role is the assistance I can give 
Hosokawa as political leader. 
  [Iwasa] Don't you think there are a variety of ways to carry 
out reforms? 
  [Tanaka] No, I think there are only two -- the successful 
and the unsuccessful. I think the process of carrying out 
reform is very important. In carrying out political reform for 
example, one way may be to force the bills through without any 
sort of consensus, the other way is to deal with the bills in 
such a way that even opponents of reform will be able to 
cooperate once the bills are passed into law. In carrying out 
political reform, we should make every effort to take the latter 
road, as this is important in the world of politics. I envy, 
though, the freedom of the mass media to make bold statements. 
<H3>  After Reform, We Aim To Form a Brilliant Country, Even 
Though It May Be Small </H3>
  [Iwasa] What type of a leader will be needed in the future? 
  [Tanaka] I am not good at talking about leadership. We are 
currently at the stage of drawing up plans for the three major 
reforms. Once our social system has undergone the changes 
envisaged in the reforms, then the setting will also be changed. 
The "Sakigake" (Harbinger) to which I belong is trying to 
visualize the sort of ideals we should have then, what type of a 
nation we should build, and what type of a people should we 
become. It is rather on these points that I can communicate 
with Hosokawa. In 20 or 30 years from now, Japan will be able 
to establish its life-style as a whole with its identity as a 
nation also established. Personally, I hope that, by every 
means, Japan will become a country where importance is placed on 
quality and substance. Whenever I have a drink with Takemura, 
he says, "it is our earnest dream to build a brilliant country, 
even though it may be small." Hosokawa shares the same dream. 
Their philosophy seems to be closest in this respect. 
  [Iwasa] How is he going to deal with foreign countries? At 
the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference], the 
United States expressed its intention to stress inter-Pacific 
relations. 
  [Tanaka] The United States is more concerned with Asia than 
we suppose it to be. It is true that Asia is a very active 
area. However, there exist in Asia certain countries which have 
different social structures and which are in different stages of 
development. The best approach for Japan is to assist each 
country bearing in mind its level of development. Japan should 
not try to assume leadership. The United States should also try 
to be patient in dealing with Asia, or it may fail. I 
accompanied [the prime minister] when he attended the APEC the 
other day. When President Clinton said "let us toast" at the 
dinner party sponsored by the APEC, I found the wine had not 
been served yet, and there was only a glass of water before me. 
Well, since I love water, I was happy to give my toast with 
water (laughter).

<F P=106> [From Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Jan 94 Morning </F>
Edition] 
  [Text] According to a survey the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan [SDPJ] conducted of Diet members affiliated with the 
party, a majority of SDPJ Dietmen favored joining hands with the 
Japan New Party [JNP] and the Sakigake [Harbinger] Party in the 
event of a regrouping of political parties. On the issue of the 
consumption tax, around 60 percent of the pollees expressed 
conditional approval. 
  The SDPJ organ SHAKAI SHIMPO conducted a survey of all Diet 
members belonging to the SDPJ-Goken Minshu Rengo [Democratic 
Alliance to Safeguard the Constitution, the SDPJ's floor 
grouping in the Diet] from late November to early December. 
Results of the poll were published in the 1 January issue of 
the paper. 
  Valid answers were received from 112, or 74.3 percent, of 
all 
pollees. 
  To the question "which parties should the SDPJ join hands 
with in the forthcoming regrouping of political parties?" (more 
than one answer possible), 30.4 percent favored the JNP, topping 
the list, followed by 29.5 percent opting for Sakigake, and 28.6 
for the United Social Democratic Party. Both the Komeito and 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] received minimal support at 3.6 
and 1.8 percent, respectively, indicating the strong antipathy 
toward these two parties. While none of the pollees cited the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or the Japan Communist Party as 
possible partners, as many as 21.4 percent of the SDPJ Dietmen 
polled preferred to cooperate with "certain LDP members." 
  As to the decisive political value in the regrouping of the 
political parties (more than one answer possible), 42.9 percent 
said the crucial issue would be whether a party "gives priority 
to human rights, welfare, and the environment, or to development 
and economic growth," followed by 41.4 percent stressing whether 
it "favors dominant power for the consumers [seikatsusha, 
consumers in the broad sense] or for the state," and 39.3 
percent attaching importance to whether it "defends the 
Constitution or attempts to amend it." 
  With regard to the "steering of the coalition government," a 
considerable majority, 53.6 percent, favored "enhancing unity in 
the administration while gradually realizing the SDPJ's 
political ideas." On the other hand, those attaching more 
importance to the coalition, asserting "the party's basic 
policies should be further revised to support the coalition 
government more forcefully" made up only 18.8 percent, while 
17.9 percent favored cooperation outside the framework of the 
cabinet, and 0.9 percent advocated secession from the coalition. 
  According to the poll, 58 percent expressed the opinion that 
the consumption tax "should be tolerated somehow," far exceeding 
the 22.3 percent who opted for "abolition" of the tax -- which 
was a SDPJ electoral promise -- or the 11.6 percent who favored 
"changing this to a specific-purpose tax." 
  SDPJ Deputy Secretary General Masanori Goto wrote in the 
SHAKAI SHIMPO that "Our stance is different from that of the 
Komeito and Shinseito. The image the SDPJ wants to create has 
become quite clear. I think the `social democratic label' will 
be the key word in the regrouping of political parties."

  [Text] The Science and Technology Agency and the Power 
Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation have decided on 
a plan to build the world's first "monobloc reactor" that will 
have fuel reprocessing facilities and fuel assembly facilities 
incorporated into a single unit. This prototype reactor 
(Reactor No. 2) will be a successor to the plutonium-fueled 
"Monju" prototype fast breeder reactor which is due to become 
fully operational in April. 
  In a monobloc reactor, nuclear materials can be handled 
internally and need not be brought out of the facility. Hence, 
there is no need to worry about the possibility of plutonium 
being robbed by terrorist groups. It will be an advanced atomic 
reactor which burns fuel with highly toxic transuranic elements 
mixed in it, thus reducing the danger of producing nuclear dust. 
The plan will be included in the government's "long-term plan 
on nuclear power development and utilization" which will be 
finalized this summer, and it envisages putting the reactor into 
operation around 2015. The system is expected to contribute to 
soothing foreign countries' concerns about Japan's use of 
plutonium. 
  Normally, plutonium is generated when uranium is burnt in a 
nuclear reactor, and highly enriched plutonium can be used on 
the warheads of nuclear missiles. Plutonium reprocessing and 
fuel processing, as such, are considered very delicate 
technologies, and even peaceful-purpose facilities are subject 
to strict inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
and de facto surveillance by the United States. 
  Japan, which believes the fast breeder reactor (FBR) should 
be the country's main nuclear reactor in the forthcoming 
century, needs to make its plans transparent so it will not be 
suspected of having nuclear weapon designs -- as the DPRK (North 
Korea) currently is. Japan must also develop an FBR system which 
cannot be converted for use in making nuclear arms. 
  A monobloc reactor will not require plutonium shipments, 
except for one initial load. Therefore, the system is expected 
to easily gain the understanding of the Clinton government which 
wants to enforce the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  In addition, the system has the great merit of being able to 
burn the transuranic elements, which can emanate strong 
radioactivity for hundreds to tens of thousands of years, in the 
reactor. When the atomic nuclei of these elements are bombarded 
by neutrons, the elements change into substances of shorter 
radioactivity or lower radioactivity, which means they can be 
easily stored underground. 
  Above all, the system precludes the possibility of pure 
plutonium--which is generated in the reprocessing process at 
present--being used in making arms. 
  In order to incorporate this new technology into a prototype 
reactor, the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development 
Corporation intends to change--in the future--the core of the 
"Monju" reactor, which will become operational in April. Going 
into the 21st century, the corporation will also launch related 
research and development projects including one to study the 
burning of transuranic elements. 
  On the first prototype reactor to be built in the early 21st 
century, the electric power industry has already decided that it 
should be of a "top-entry" [word published in English] type 
wherein coolants are poured in from the top of the reactor.

  [Text] On 6 January, Prime Minister Hosokawa made it known 
that he has no intention of cutting defense spending in the 1994 
fiscal budget. A specific growth rate for defense spending for 
fiscal 1994 will be set in the course of compiling the budget. 
With the prime minister expressing his intention not to cut 
defense spending, there is a high possibility that defense 
spending will grow by 1.95 percent, the same percentage point as 
the growth rate of the 1994 budget. 
  Asked by a reporter if he intends to cut defense spending 
for 
fiscal 1994 after a Japan Security Council session on 6 January, 
the prime minister said: "I will not cut defense spending." The 
prime minister also reiterated his plan to review the "Guideline 
for Japan's Defense Buildup," a basic policy for the buildup of 
Japan's defense capabilities and to reflect the review's results 
in the 1995 fiscal budget. 
  The Japan Security Council session was called to discuss a 
draft preliminary budget request for the 1994 defense budget. 
At the session, Foreign Minister Hata and Defense Agency 
Director General Kazuo Aichi sought an understanding by other 
cabinet members about the need to increase the defense budget, 
saying: "Although the U.S.-Soviet confrontation has ended, the 
unstable situation still continues in Asia and disarmament has 
yet to be carried out in the region." In response, some cabinet 
members attending the session said: "Japan should define its 
defense budget in light of the global disarmament trend." 
During the session, cabinet members from the ruling Social 
Democratic Party of Japan did not oppose the government's plans 
to purchase two Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) 
aircraft and modified Patriot antiair missiles. 
  The preliminary budget request for the 1994 defense budget 
amounts to 4,731.1 billion yen [Y], an increase of approximately 
Y96 billion from a year earlier. The increase is comprised of 
approximately Y60 billion to meet increased wages for members of 
the Self-Defense Forces and approximately Y36 billion to meet 
the cost of maintaining U.S. Forces in Japan, while 42 percent 
of the defense budget is allocated for personnel expenses and 
food and 37 percent of it is set to be spent for military 
hardware payments for 1993 purchases. For this reason, the 
Defense Agency [DA] has made a "minimum request to avoid facing 
any further cuts" (says a top DA official). The Finance 
Ministry, however, has openly said that it will cut the defense 
budget without regard to its sanctuary. 
  While some believe that the prime minister indicated his 
intention not to cut defense spending because of his full 
understanding of the present state of Japan's defense, others 
believe that with Japan-U.S. summit talks set to be held in 
January, the prime minister expressed his intention not to cut 
defense spending after concluding that it was not good policy to 
cut the sympathetic budget for U.S. Forces in Japan and the 
budget for the AWACS aircraft purchase for which the United 
States has asked Japan as part of the efforts to cut its trade 
surplus with the United States.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 6 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs that the State Great Hural (SGH) 
session heard and agreed with the final wording of the [word 
indistinct] on struggle with smoking. Many parliamentarians, as 
the newspaper notes, consider that the law has become tough 
enough, which would influence its realization. 
  The State Great Hural session started consideration of the 
draft law on struggle with hard drinking. The necessity of 
adoption of this law is based on the increasing use of strong 
drinks, which is one of the main reasons for infringement of 
public order and law. At present 6.3 litres of strong drinks 
fall on an adult citizen in the country over 20 percent of the 
adults are using alcohol regularly. The working group, which 
prepared the draft law, considers expedient to struggle with 
hard drinking in four directions: production, sale, use, import. 
  An official of the Statistical Department D. Gombodorj in an 
interview with the newspaper correspondent notes that according 
to the preliminary data of the census of cattle, the number of 
[word indistinct] in the country has dropped by 2 percent as 
compared with the previous year. For the present the final data 
is not received yet, announces D. Gombodorj, but in the course 
of the census there were many cattle-breeders, having more than 
a thousand heads of cattle in private possession. The final 
results of the census will be summed up in January 20. 
  The newspaper publishes an article by the Minister of 
Construction and Town-Building T. Damiran devoted to the 
town-building problems. As the minister considers, optimum 
establishment and foundation of the main centers of regions in 
the country is of great importance. T. Damiran explains this by 
an advantage of regioning the country's territory, which is 
connected with problems of development of infrastructure. 
  The newspaper Beijing correspondent T. Surenjav in his 
article points out to the increase of the number of Mongolian 
students and post-graduate students, studying in China since 
normalization of bilateral relations. At the same time, he 
criticizes that probationers are often sent to China on 
different lines for training, not having knowledge in the 
Chinese language. 
  The newspaper publishes an article "Colours of the New Year" 
by the parliament correspondent of the Mongolian People's 
Revolutionary Party newspaper "UNEN" S. Tserenpil. He notes 
that in the last 70 years the Mongols got used to celebrate 
[words indistinct], he says that it is just that the Mongols are 
called the Asians with European thinking. In any case, writes 
the correspondent, I talked to some members of the parliament on 
the occasion of the new year. The parliamentarians consider that 
the State Great Hural becomes more professional. 
  As the newspaper "UNEN" informs, the Mongolian People's 
Revolutionary Party (MPRP) group in the parliament discussed the 
issues of its activity. The head of the parliament MPRP group 
D. Demberel in his report at the meeting pointed out to the 
necessity of activization of its work in the State Great Hural. 
In Demberel's view, a successful work of the parliament depends 
to a large extent on efforts of the MPRP group, uniting the 
majority of the parliament members. 
  The newspaper carries an article devoted to the issues of 
property in land. The author S. Badam considers that the 
transferring of a land to the possession of citizens should be 
solved carefully, taking into consideration national [words 
indistinct], including interests of pasturable cattlebreeding.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 7 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper ARDIYN ERH informs that the State Great Hural (SGH) 
session continues discussing the draft law on struggle with hard 
drinking. For the present the parliament members agreed with the 
provision banning the use of strong drinks by under age persons. 
  As the newspaper informs, at the first in the current year 
sitting the government discussed an issue about making 
amendments and additions in the draft laws on social insurance. 
The government agreed in principle with the draft laws and 
empowered the Minister of Demographic Policy and Labour E. 
Gombojav to submit the draft laws for consideration to the 
corresponding parliament committee. 
  The government considered amendments and additions made in 
the draft law on statistics. The law is to regulate relations 
connected with foundation of a single system of statistical 
information up to market conditions and international 
requirements. 
  At the sitting heard was an information about the course of 
elaboration and realization of programmes and projects approved 
by the government and planned for 1993-1996, and also an 
information about purveyance and use of meat in 1993. 
  The government decided to submit for ratification to the 
parliament the convention and the rules of the international 
telegraph communication organization. 
  In an interview with the newspaper correspondent the General 
Director of the Trade and Development Bank E. Sandagdorj 
announces that the bank headed by him has considerably 
strengthened its solvency and can render its clients any service 
on internal and external operations. E. Sandagdorj notes that 
in 1994 the bank decided to reduce by one third the interests 
for the credits granted. This measure, he notes, is directed to 
production expansion and creation of new work-places. 
  The newspaper informs about different exhibitions, including 
international ones, which are planned to be organized in the 
Mongolian capital in 1994-1995 on the line of the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry. 
  Among these exhibitions there are exhibitions of Italian and 
South Korean goods, the trade union newspaper, HODOLMOR, carries 
an interview of its correspondent with professor of the 
Management' Institute, Doctor of Economic Science D. Lhaashid. 
In his view, the present difficulties in the country can be 
called an economic crisis. The professor considers that for the 
present, the government is taking only provisional, artificial 
measures on reduction of inflation rates. The main thing, 
stressed the professor, is in internal production increase, 
providing at the expense of that the population with goods. D. 
Lhaashid considers as right the tough credit-currency policy of 
the government, which is directed to a support for new 
enterprises. In D. Lhaashid's view, in the country a process of 
dividing the population into rich and poor will continue, which 
is connected with market relations. 
  D. Lhaashid considers that in the new year positive changes 
will take place in the country's economy. 
  The newspaper carries the readers' answers to the newspaper 
questions. The readers are sharing their impressions on 1993 
and plans for 1994.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 8 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper ARDIYN ERH informs that the State Great Hural (SGH) 
session finished consideration in the first reading of the draft 
law on struggle with hard drinking. The draft law envisages 
production of strong drinks, except the traditional milk vodka, 
only with permission of the government on the basis of 
suggestions of corresponding state and professional organs. 
  Permissions on sale of standard strong drinks will be given 
by aymag and city administration heads. 
  The draft law envisages measures on anti-alcohol propaganda. 
In connection with the expected adoption of the law on struggle 
with hard drinking an issue about additions and amendments in 
the law on administrative responsibility was discussed. 
  The draft of the corresponding law is agreed in the main. At 
the session an information of the Chairman of the Constitutional 
Court G. Sobd was heard. He informed that the court has 
considered as groundless the complaint of the two citizens of 
the capital, concerning the elections of the State Great Hural 
in 1992, these citizens considered that the elections have been 
conducted with violations of the Constitution. The session 
approved the resolution on recognition of the conclusion of the 
Constitutional Court. The parliament set to consideration of 
the draft law on regulation of foreign currency activities. 
Discussion of the draft law in the first reading finished at 
the yesterday's sitting. 
  As the newspaper notes, moulding of bronzea monument to D. 
Suhbaatar on the central square of the capital, seemingly, is 
postponed for an uncertain period of time. The chief painter of 
the capital N. Vanchig, the chief architect T. Jadambaa and 
other persons write in the newspaper about this issue. The main 
reason for this is the lack of financial means. 
  The chief painter of the city N. Vanchig expresses 
confidence 
that the moulding of the monument of bronze will be 
accomplished, when it will become possible. The newspaper 
informs about the planned realization of some projects on 
reconstruction of the country's railway transport at the expense 
of assistance and credits of foreign countries and international 
organizations. With a gratis assistance of Japan works on 
expansion of the border railway station Zamyn-uud have started. 
Japan agreed also to grant credit worth of 71 mln [million] US 
dollars on favourable terms for development of railway 
transport. An agreement on granting in the first instance 30 
mln dollars within the next two years was signed between the 
governments of the two countries. 
  Besides that, credits for renewal of the rolling stock will 
be granted by the World Bank. The newspaper points out to the 
necessity of an effective use of credit means, in an interview 
with the newspaper correspondent an official of the National 
Development Department P. Danspanjav announces that for building 
a hydroelectric power station on the River Egiingol 268 mln US 
dollars are needed, the Asian Development Bank agreed to allot 
700 mln US dollars. The rest of means should be allotted by the 
Mongolian side. The issue, as it is supposed, will be 
considered in the first quarter of the current year. The 
hydroelectric power station project is accomplished by Mongolian 
specialists jointly with the Swiss company "Electrowatt". As P. 
Dansranjav considers, capital investments in building the 
electric power station, in all probability, will be allotted 
starting from 1995. 
  The agricultural newspaper MONGOLYN HUDOO publishes an 
interview of the Chief of the Food Department of the Ministry of 
Food and Agriculture B. Alzahgui. He tells about measures on 
realization of the government programme "Food '93". B. Alzahgui 
tells that in 1993 measures have been taken on mobilization of 
internal resources for improvement of food supply of the 
population, involving in this work all citizens. In 7993 many 
families started breeding cattle, pigs, raising poultry, growing 
vegetables. According to the preliminary data, more than 40 
thousand families and 1000 economic units started being engaged 
in agriculture. Approximately the same number of families and 
organizations in cattle pig-breeding, poultry farming, at many 
places in rabbit breeding and bee-keeping. For these purposes 
the state has granted to aymags and cities 180 mln tugriks 
credit on favourable terms. Realization of the projects on 
production of vegetable oil and granulated sugar in the country 
has begun. B. Alzahgui notes that there are all opportunities 
for supplying the population with food at the expense of 
internal sources, the newspaper publishes an interview of its 
correspondent with the administration head of Ulaanuul Somon of 
Hubsgul Aymag D. Seseer, he notes that in the majority of bags 
(primary administrative units) [word indistinct] persons are 
elected their chairmen. The new persons, notes D. Seseer, are 
striving to work in a new fashion. D. Seseer notes that the 
local authorities have to face also many difficulties, lack of 
means, premises, transport, he considers the administration 
heads as the main support for local authorities.

in all probability, will be allotted starting from 1995. 
  As P. Dansranjav informs, the Academy of Sciences has 
submitted for consideration to the government a project on 
foundation of small solar electric power stations with the 
Japanese assistance. In case of granting a credit worth of 08 
[as received] mln tugriks there is a possibility to found more 
than 3000 solar electric power stations attached to rural 
hospitals, schools, cattle breeding camps, the details for such 
stations will be delivered from Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- Vice Foreign Minister 
Kunihiko Saito denied reports Monday [10 January] that Japan is 
pessimistic about the prospects for framework trade talks with 
the United States. 
  Saito told a press conference that it is "clearly a 
misunderstanding" to assume that Japan has lost its drive in the 
trade talks. 
  He pointed out that there is still a month before February 
11 
when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton meet in Washington. 
  Japan and the United States have promised to come up with an 
agreement on the bilateral framework trade talks by then. 
  Little progress has been reported so far on the talks, which 
is being held under the Japan-U.S. trade framework accord 
concluded last July. 
  Saito also said the trade negotiations are "two-way talks" 
and are not aimed at having Japan alone make concessions. 
  He said there are various points where the United States 
should compromise and called for Washington's continued efforts 
to boost its competition and to reduce its financial deficit. 
  Specifically, Saito urged some U.S. states to further open 
their markets to foreign companies and businesses, saying 
markets in some of the U.S. states are "not as open as some 
foreign countries desire" because of the difference in systems 
from state to state.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 8 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
remain widely divided on automobile trade as they were prepared 
to start negotiations on the issue next week, Japanese 
Government officials said Saturday [8 January]. 
  The four-day subcabinet-level negotiations will begin in 
Tokyo on Tuesday under an agreement to work out a new framework 
for bilateral trade. 
  The officials said Washington insists on a tough stand 
concerning auto and auto parts trade, pressing Japan to make 
further concessions to open its automobile market wider to 
imports. 
  The negotiations will focus on a U.S. demand that Japan set 
a numerical target for imports of U.S.-built cars and parts, 
they said. 
  In previous sessions of the talks, the United States 
proposed 
that the Japanese Government ask Japanese automakers to extend 
their programs for imports of U.S.-made auto parts beyond fiscal 
1995 and that the Japanese and U.S. Governments work out rough 
measures setting the value of Japanese imports of finished cars 
and parts from the United States in the future. 
  Sluggish automobile sales at home and overseas have made it 
difficult for the Japanese auto industry to compromise on the 
U.S. stance, the officials said. 
  They said Washington will find it equally difficult to back 
down on its stand as automobile trade accounts for a large 
portion of its trade deficit with Japan. 
  The officials said the negotiations may drag on toward a 
February 11 summit between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 8 KYODO -- Japan plans to stop its 
self-imposed quota on passenger car exports to the United States 
after the fiscal 1993 quota expires March 31, government sources 
said Saturday [8 January]. 
  The export quota, first imposed in fiscal 1981 amid growing 
friction between Japan and the U.S. over auto trade, is set at 
1.65 million vehicles for fiscal 1993. 
  But since fiscal 1987, Japan's car exports to the U.S. has 
fallen short of the quota, as Japanese automakers were boosting 
production at U.S. plants. 
  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is to make 
a 
final decision on whether to eliminate the voluntary restraint 
after consulting with domestic automakers and reviewing ongoing 
bilateral trade talks on autos and auto parts, the sources said. 
  As the "Big Three" U.S. automakers are regaining the 
competitive edge from the Japanese, their executives have voiced 
support for scrapping the export quota, despite stalled 
bilateral talks on auto and auto parts trade. 
  Under the so-called framework negotiations, Tokyo and 
Washington remain at odds over the numerical targets demanded by 
Washington, but rejected by Tokyo, to measure progress in market 
opening.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 8 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
plans to introduce a new action program designed to open its 
construction market to foreign bidders at informal negotiations 
with the United States in Tokyo next week, officials said 
Saturday [8 January]. 
  The government officials said the program, featuring 
improvement of a bidding system for public works projects, is 
aimed at dodging possible U.S. retaliatory action against Japan. 
  Japan hopes to wind up the talks successfully by the end of 
next week, they said. 
  The U.S. has threatened to take retaliatory action against 
Japan unless the negotiations produce satisfactory results by 
the January 20 deadline. 
  The negotiations, which will open Tuesday at the earliest, 
will focus on a foreign share of the Japanese construction 
market and foreign access to 40 large-scale projects, which have 
been opened to U.S. contractors as a special step, the 
officials said. 
  The program will allow foreign contractors to participate in 
tenders for national projects valued at 4.5 million special 
drawing rights (about 850 million yen under the official 
exchange rate) or more and for projects valued at 15 million 
SDRs (2.85 billion yen) or more to be undertaken by local 
governments or public corporations, they said. 
  Japan will also offer to improve the process for reviewing 
the qualifications of foreign bidders in order to boost foreign 
access to the domestic construction market, they said. 
  Standard rules agreed on at the recently concluded world 
trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade will be applied, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- Four cabinet ministers 
compared notes Monday [10 January] on a fresh action program to 
open Japan's large-scale public works projects to foreign 
bidders, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara said. 
  The ministers confirmed that the action plan should be 
designed to boost transparency, objectivity and free competition 
in Japan's construction market and secure greater foreign 
access, Ishihara said. 
  They were Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Construction 
Minister Kozo Igarashi, Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato and 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  The 20-minute meeting was in line with Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's instruction on October 22 to hammer out an 
action program in early 1994 to open Japan's construction market 
to foreign firms. 
  The government issued an outline of the scheme to improve 
its 
public works bidding systems on October 26 to avert U.S. 
punitive actions against Japan. 
  Ishihara told a news conference the government hopes to 
thrash out details of the action program by around mid-January. 
  He denied, however, that the timetable has anything to do 
with the January 20 deadline for U.S. sanctions against Japan 
over construction procurement practices. 
  "It is not that we are working out an action plan in the 
face 
of threatened sanctions but at our own volition," Ishihara said. 
  The United States has threatened to impose sanctions if 
Japan 
fails to take steps to increase the openness of its construction 
market and secure greater foreign access by January 20, an 
extended deadline from the original October 31. 
  Ishihara also said that all cabinet ministers, except Sadao 
Yamahana who is in charge of political reform, will meet prior 
to a regular cabinet session on Tuesday morning to exchange 
views on the planned action program. 
  At the meeting, Ishihara said, Hosokawa will explain the 
outcome of Monday's talks and seek cooperation from the 
ministers. 
  He revealed that ministers did not discuss the value of 
projects undertaken by national and local governments, or by 
public corporations, for which foreign contractors will be 
allowed to participate in tenders. 
  The four ministers also did not talk about a possible halt 
to 
preferential treatment for U.S. construction firms in bidding 
for Japan's major public works projects, the deputy chief 
cabinet secretary said. 
  Igarashi, the construction minister, has said Tokyo may stop 
such preferential treatment for U.S. firms in return for the 
introduction of an open bidding system. 
  U.S. construction firms have received work on 34 Japanese 
projects worth a total of nearly 100 billion yen, including New 
Kansai International Airport near Osaka, western Japan, since 
the two governments agreed on the idea in 1988.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 8 KYODO -- Defense talks between Japan 
and China will be held in Beijing in late February as part of 
confidence-building measures, government sources said Saturday 
[8 January]. 
  In addition, the sources said, representatives of the agency 
and the Russian Defense Ministry will meet in Tokyo in early 
February for a second round of official consultations on 
security matters following a similar meeting in Moscow in June 
1992. 
  The working-level talks with China, which will be attended 
by 
defense officials and ranking members of the Self-Defense Forces 
and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are the first since 
the visit of China's defense minister in 1984. 
  Following a trip to China by then Defense Agency Chief Yuko 
Kurihara in 1987, regular working-level defense talks were 
envisaged, but the plans were suspended after Beijing's military 
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators at the Tiananmen Square 
in June 1989. 
  Tokyo, however, decided to go ahead with the original 
project 
after Washington and Beijing resumed defense talks with the 
visit of a senior Pentagon official to China last autumn, the 
sources said. 
  The defense talks come at a time of allegations that China's 
long-time ally North Korea is pursuing a nuclear weapons 
development program. 
  "Through dialogue with other countries such as China and 
Russia, we aim not only at fostering mutual understanding, but 
also at making sure that Japan has a say concerning North 
Korea's alleged nuclear development," a Defense Agency source 
said. 
  The talks also reflect the agency's efforts to launch a 
broader security dialogue with Asian neighbors to revise 
outdated Cold War defense patterns, the sources said. 
  Defense consultations with Russia will therefore focus on 
security guarantees and be upgraded to section chief level, the 
sources said. 
  In line with more active military exchanges to build trust 
in 
the Asia-Pacific region, Japan will see the first ever visit by 
an incumbent South Korean defense minister at the end of March, 
the sources said.

  [Text] Narita, Chiba Pref., Jan. 8 KYODO -- Japanese 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata left for Beijing on Saturday 
morning [8 January] for a two-day visit to China for talks with 
Chinese leaders. 
  Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, is scheduled to 
have 
separate talks later in the day with Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen and Premier Li Peng. Hata will meet President and 
Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin on Sunday before 
returning to Tokyo later the same day. 
  Talks between Hata and Qian, who met twice last year -- in 
New York in late September and in Seattle in November -- will 
cover bilateral and international affairs, according to Foreign 
Ministry officials. 
  The two foreign ministers will discuss the situation on the 
Korean peninsula as well as problems concerning North Korea's 
suspected development of nuclear weapons, the officials said. 
  Japan is likely to call on China to urge Pyongyang to accept 
international inspections of its nuclear facilities, since 
Beijing has the "largest official channel" with Pyongyang, they 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- Japanese shipbuilders are 
worried that the capacity expansion by South Korean shipbuilders 
could spark a global discount race for new orders, industry 
sources said Monday [10 January]. 
  The sources said the Japanese industry plans to raise the 
issue at high-level negotiations in Tokyo in March with its 
South Korean officials. 
  They said the South Korea's Hyundai group conglomerate plans 
to complete a new facility for construction of large-sized oil 
tankers by 1995. 
  Samsung, another industrial giant, reportedly is set to 
start 
construction of a large-scale dockyard this month, they said. 
  South Korean shipbuilders apparently are trying to 
strengthen 
their position as the world's leading shipbuilding nation by 
capitalizing on a slump in the Japanese shipbuilding industry 
resulting from the yen's appreciation, they said. 
  The South Korean shipbuilding industry received a record 
high 
of new shipbuilding orders aggregating 9.52 million gross tons 
in 1993, replacing Japan as the world's leading shipbuilder for 
the first time. 
  The sources said that Japanese shipbuilders have refrained 
from expanding their production capacity because of a global 
surplus.

  [Text] Zagreb, Yugoslavia, Jan. 9 KYODO -- Yasushi Akashi, 
the Japanese national who heads peacekeeping operations in 
former Yugoslavia, asked Saturday [8 January] if Japan could 
send personnel to the United Nations mission in the region, a 
Japanese delegation said. 
  The head of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former 
Yugoslavia suggested parts of Macedonia and Croatia as sites for 
Japan's possible participation. 
  Akashi made the request during a meeting with an 11-member 
fact-finding mission which arrived in the Croatian capital of 
Zagreb from Japan earlier in the day, officials said. 
  He did not specify if he sought military or civilian 
peacekeepers. The Japanese team did not give an immediate 
response, the officials said. 
  Akashi told the delegation that the situation is relatively 
stable in parts of Macedonia and Croatia. 
  He noted that some Asian states like Nepal and Malaysia are 
joining the U.N. Protection Force in former Yugoslavia. 
  In an interview with Fuji TV of Tokyo, delegation head 
Shunji 
Yanai said Akashi did not ask Japan to send peacekeepers to the 
Balkan region. 
  Yanai, speaking by telephone from Zagreb, said Akashi merely 
told the team that he hopes Japan will positively engage in a 
personnel contribution. 
  Yanai told Fuji's news report 2001 program that Akashi did 
not specify if the contribution meant dispatch of peacekeepers 
or sending medical or communication teams. 
  The Japanese delegation left Tokyo on Friday and arrived in 
Zagreb on Saturday via Amsterdam and Vienna. Members are there 
to study possible roles for Japan in the U.N. operation. They 
will stay in former Yugoslavia through January 16, visiting 
Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and the new Yugoslavia. 
The mission returns home January 16. 
  Yanai, head of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy Bureau, 
played a key role in realizing Japan's legislation in June 1992 
on cooperation in U.N. peacekeeping missions. He was then 
director general of the ministry's Treaties Bureau which 
supervises treaties and laws under its jurisdiction. 
  Under the U.N. Peace Cooperation Law, Japan sent two 
600-member engineering teams in rotation from the Self-Defense 
Forces (SDF) to join U.N. operations in Cambodia between the 
fall of 1992 and the fall of 1993. 
  A smaller SDF transportation support team is helping a U.S. 
peacekeeping mission in Mozambique.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 8 KYODO -- Strengthening ties with the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is becoming a major 
task for Japan's diplomacy, Foreign Ministry officials said 
Saturday [8 January]. 
  The Foreign Ministry aims to boost Japan's ties with NATO 
this year by cosponsoring a seminar in Europe and hosting a 
high-level political and security dialogue in Tokyo, they said. 
  Japan's increasing interest in ties with NATO reflects 
concern over the strong showing of nationalists in Russia's 
recent elections, the problem of control over nuclear weapons in 
Ukraine, and other uncertainties in the political situation of 
the former Soviet Union. 
  The officials said the two forums will focus particularly on 
the unstable situation in Russia, which is the most crucial 
issue commonly facing Japan and NATO. 
  In addition, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is expected to 
reschedule his postponed trip to NATO headquarters in Brussels 
for July, just prior to the annual summit that month of the 
Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations in Naples. 
  Hata was originally scheduled to make the visit this month, 
but postponed it due to the extension of the current Diet 
session. 
  Japan has also begun participating in meetings of the 
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) with a 
special status short of full membership. 
  The officials said closer ties with such European bodies, in 
addition to expanding opportunity for dialogue on issues of 
mutual concern, will be of benefit to Japan as it considers how 
to enlarge its contribution to international efforts now under 
way in the former Yugoslavia.

  It was the first time this year a boat reportedly carrying 
refugees was spotted in the vicinity of Okinawa, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry (MITI) will stop the 
controversial practice of promoting officials who are about to 
quit government service to run in elections, its vice minister 
said Monday [10 January]. 
  The move comes shortly after a high-ranking MITI bureaucrat 
resigned following the trade minister's intervention in such a 
case. 
  Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano said at a press conference that 
the ministry will exercise impartiality in personnel changes 
even for officials intending to enter politics. 
  "We will strictly refrain from creating a new post for an 
official who plans to quit for elections, for example, so as not 
to cause suspicion of any special consideration on the 
assumption of transfer to the political world." 
  Late last December, Masahisa Naito resigned as director 
general of the ministry's Industrial Policy Bureau following 
conflict with MITI Minister hiroshi kumagai. 
  The minister had urged Naito to resign, saying he had shown 
favoritism in promoting a junior when Naito was director general 
at the minister's Secretariat. 
  Naito contended at his last press conference that he could 
not understand nor accept Kumagai's reasons for demanding his 
resignation, saying, "the promotion in question followed MITI's 
conventional practice." 
  Such promotions are regarded as boosting the curricula vitae 
of prospective political candidates.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- The government and the 
ruling coalition decided Monday [10 January] to push a set of 
political reform bills through the House of Councillors on 
January 19, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama said. 
  At a meeting of leaders of the government and ruling 
parties, 
Social Democratic Party Secretary General Wataru Kubo reported 
that the coalition parties want the reform bills to clear an 
upper house special panel on political reform on January 18 and 
the full upper chamber on January 19, Hatoyama told a news 
conference. 
  Kubo was quoted as saying the coalition parties intend to 
set 
aside January 17 for a public hearing on the 
government-sponsored reform measures even if the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) opposes the idea. 
  Once a public hearing finishes, a bill can be put to a vote 
at a Diet committee. 
  The government approved the coalition plan to finish upper 
house deliberations on January 19 on political reform aimed at 
rooting out corruption that seems endemic to Japan's money 
driven political system, Hatoyama said. 
  The reform package is intended to introduce single-seat 
constituencies combined with proportional representation for 
lower house elections and impose stricter controls on campaign 
funding. 
  The bills cleared the lower house in mid-November and are 
pending in the upper house. 
  Kubo reportedly said the coalition has no intention of 
beginning talks with the LDP on possible modifications of the 
bills unless the ruling and opposition parties agree to 
enactment of the bills in the current Diet session, which closes 
on January 29. 
  The government and coalition parties should wait for the 
LDP's move on political reform despite LDP Secretary General 
Yoshiro Mori's remark on Friday that the party would help pass 
the bills in the current Diet sitting if they were first revised. 
  Hiroyuki Sonoda, secretary general of Sakigake (Harbinger), 
and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, also called 
for prudence about talks with the LDP on possible amendments of 
the bills, saying it is still unclear whether the LDP is serious 
about reform, according to Hatoyama. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said earlier 
Monday that he welcomes Mori's remark, which was interpreted as 
suggesting a shift in the LDP's stance on political reform. 
  Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi said the government 
and the ruling coalition parties should make clear that they pay 
due attention to minor groupings in the Diet, Hatoyama said. 
  While Ichikawa voiced concern about the tight Diet schedule, 
Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the Democratic Socialist 
Party, expressed hope the LDP will present its plan as early as 
possible if it seeks modifications of the government reform 
bills. 
  Kubo also proposed that the government promise the LDP to 
revise the bills after they become law in a bid to secure their 
passage through the Diet by January 29, Hatoyama said, adding 
that Ichikawa expressed his personal approval of the plan.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- The yen should decline 
against the dollar to reflect economic fundamentals, Gaishi 
Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations 
(Keidanren), said Monday [10 January] . 
  Hiraiwa said at a press conference the yen's further drop 
will help stimulate Japan's economy, pointing out that the 
United States has hoped that Japan's economic recovery would 
also benefit the U.S. economy. 
  His remark was made following a comment by U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen last week warning Tokyo against relying 
on a weaker yen. 
  "Allowing the yen to slide is not an acceptable way out of 
recession for Japan," Bentsen said. 
  The dollar closed in Tokyo on Monday at 111.73 yen, down 
0.75 
yen from last Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- Japan's potential and 
desirable economic growth is in the lower half of the 3 percent 
level, a high-ranking trade ministry official said Monday [10 
January]. 
  Vice International Trade and Industry Minister Hideaki 
Kumano 
said at a press conference, "I don't think our potential to 
attain 3 percent level economic growth has changed so much," 
despite the current business conditions. 
  While noting cyclic factors, Kumano stressed the need for 
implementation of middle- and long-term policies, both 
macroeconomic and microeconomic, so as to realize the nation's 
economic potential in the 21st century. 
  Kumano said the recent drop in the yen's value against the 
U.S. dollar on foreign exchange markets was not yet enough from 
the viewpoint of corporate profitability. 
  "Companies were a bit relieved by the recent trend toward a 
weaker yen, but you should not be too optimistic," Kumano said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 9 KYODO -- The government and ruling 
coalition parties plan to work out a 7 trillion yen package of 
stimulative measures, excluding income and residential tax cuts, 
to lift the economy out of the doldrums, sources close to the 
coalition government said Sunday [9 January]. 
  The government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will 
start 
working on the package as early as Monday, the sources said. 
  The pump-priming package is expected to feature, among other 
things, an additional 3 trillion to 4 trillion yen in spending 
on public works implemented by the central and local governments. 
  The government will also raise the ceilings on housing loans 
extended by the governmental Housing Loan Corp. and on loans 
supplied by Japan Finance Corp. for small businesses to promote 
restructuring of smaller firms, the sources said. 
  These measures will be incorporated into a third 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 that ends March 31. 
  In addition, in the national budget for fiscal 1994, the 
government intends to ease tax burdens to reactivate real estate 
deals which have remained lackluster due to the bursting of 
bubble economy of the late 1980s. 
  Moreover, it will take steps to promote house purchases by 
consumers, they said. 
  On tax cuts, the sources said the government is considering 
implementing income and residential tax cuts of 6 trillion to 7 
trillion yen retroactively from January. 
  The government is coordinating views with the ruling parties 
over ways to finance the planned tax cuts, bearing in mind the 
possibility of raising the 3 percent consumption tax in the 
future. 
  Late last year, Prime Minister Hosokawa came up with a 
six-point proposal to rev up the stagnant economy, calling for 
deregulation of government controls, the drafting of a 15-month 
budget -- made up of a third supplementary budget and the fiscal 
1994 budget -- and taking measures to help smaller businesses 
and farmers. 
  He also proposed safeguarding jobs, adding liquidity to land 
transactions and reducing the income tax. 
  On the third supplementary budget, the government is 
planning 
to boost the central government's spending on public works by 2 
to 3 trillion yen and local governments' projects by 1 trillion 
yen, the sources said. 
  In the fiscal 1994 budget, the government intends to put 
emphasis on ways to improve the quality of life and promote 
scientific research. 
  In order to expand public works projects, it will also study 
the possibility of revising upward a 10-year public investment 
plan which calls for spending 430 trillion yen over 10 years 
from fiscal 1991, the sources said. 
  Moreover, the government will set aside an additional 500 
billion to 1 trillion yen for the acquisition of land for public 
use and consider extending interest subsidies to local housing 
supply corporations to help them acquire land lots. 
  Other stimulative measures now being considered by the 
government and ruling parties include an easing of tax burdens 
on land acquisitions for commercial and cultural facilities, and 
replacements of houses. 
  The government is also expected to lower the consumption tax 
on motor vehicles from the present 4.5 percent to 3 percent in 
response to strong requests from the auto industry, the sources 
said. 
  In addition, it is likely to remove a special tax on 
business 
corporations and allow businesses to buy their own stock in a 
bid to stimulate the faltering securities market, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- The government still 
intends to unveil an additional economic stimulus package around 
January 20 despite slow progress in talks among the ruling 
coalition parties on specifics, Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura said Monday [10 January]. 
  "As of today, we still intend to unveil it by around January 
20," the government's top spokesman told a news conference. 
  He cited the talks among the ruling parties and Diet debate 
on political reform as potential stumbling blocks to the release 
of the new measures to stoke up the languishing Japanese economy. 
  Asked if the package will include income tax cuts, Takemura 
said the government will take high public expectations of such 
cuts into account in working out details of the pump-priming 
measures. 
  Earlier Monday, a government source predicted the government 
will have to delay the announcement of the additional stimulus 
measures beyond January 20 because of conflicting views in the 
coalition on whether the consumption tax, now standing at 3 
percent, should be raised to finance proposed income tax cuts. 
  The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 
timing of the announcement of the income tax reduction should be 
decided by February 11, when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is 
scheduled to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- The schedule for a third 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 has yet to be fixed, Vice 
Finance Minister Jiro Saito said Monday [10 January]. 
  The Finance Ministry [MOF] cannot begin to formulate the 
budget unless a specific framework of economic stimulus measures 
being worked out by the Economic Planning Agency is made clear, 
Saito told a press conference. 
  The third extra budget will be formed to finance additional 
public works projects and other fiscal steps expected in the 
pump-priming package to help the Japanese economy out of the 
long slump. 
  Saito avoided comment on whether or not his ministry will 
allow issuance of deficit-covering government bonds to fund 
proposed income tax cuts. 
  The MOF will respect the conclusion on the matter to be made 
by a joint economic forum between the government and ruling 
coalition parties, he said. 
  The ministry, which had been adamant about hiking the 
consumption tax to offset income tax cuts and against the 
issuance of deficit-covering bonds, reportedly softened its 
stance on the issue recently.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- Broader exemptions to the 
land-holding tax are being considered as a way to stimulate the 
stagnant economy, government sources said Monday [10 January]. 
  The tax, introduced January 1, 1992, is aimed at curbing 
Japan's astronomically high land prices. 
  The business community has called for the tax to be scrapped 
or its rate of 0.3 percent to be lowered. 
  While refusing to accept these calls, the Finance Ministry 
has decided to increase the exemptions from the tax. 
  Points being considered are a cut in the tax burdens on 
holders of land which is open to the public, public parking lots 
or sites for urban development, the sources said. 
  They said the plan will substantially ease the tax burden on 
retailers, financial institutions, realtors and the leisure 
industry, which pay hefty taxes at present because much of their 
land is located in big cities.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- Income tax reductions are 
more effective in stimulating the economy than other fiscal 
measures such as boosting public works projects, a leading 
economist said Monday [10 January]. 
  The squeeze on corporate earnings will end only after 
consumption at the household level picks up, Susumu Taketomi, 
chief economist at the Industrial Bank of Japan, told reporters 
at the Japan National Press Club. 
  Completion of corporate inventory adjustment, the first 
stage 
of economic recovery in the usual economic cycle, cannot take 
place in the absence of a recovery in personal spending, 
Taketomi added. 
  Proposed income tax cuts are expected to expand the 
purchasing power of consumers, he said. 
  Taketomi said the Japanese economy is in a crisis 
unprecedented since the end of World War II. It is suffering 
"three kinds of stagnancy" -- slack corporate capital spending, 
falling profits and near-zero real economic growth, he said. 
  The current slump is different from past ones, which were 
overcome by cyclical economic forces, he said. "The current 
economy has been stalled in a big industrial adjustment wave 
under the heavy weight of excessive manpower and investment," he 
said. 
  "The economy has been trapped in the Bermuda triangle, an 
area where many shipwrecks are said to have taken place due to a 
water level difference between the Pacific and the Atlantic." 
  "Taking a great leap over this cross-section is necessary 
for 
Japan's economy to smoothly shift from high growth to stable 
growth," Taketomi said, noting the need not only for additional 
fiscal measures by the government but for more corporate efforts 
for industrial innovation. 
  Taketomi said personal consumption could pick up in Japan if 
pent-up demand is stimulated, for example, by the launch of new 
products tailored to the varying needs of consumers. 
  Despite the domestic recession, Japan's imports have risen 
recently because consumers are going for overseas products which 
are discounted heavily but still have a qualitative appeal. 
  Demand could also emerge at any time because of the need to 
replace major durable goods like cars and televisions, he said. 
  Taketomi refrained from guessing when Japan's economy will 
hit bottom. 
  He limited himself to saying that recovery in 
nonmanufacturing sectors such as nonbank moneylenders and real 
estate will only come after that of makers and is unlikely to 
take place in 1994. 
  Low productivity may stand out in nonmanufacturers when they 
are exposed to price-cutting competition under ongoing 
deregulation, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- The Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications may halve the amount of postal insurance 
funds invested in stocks in fiscal 1994 if it is not allowed to 
make such investment directly, ministry sources said Monday [10 
January]. 
  The move could affect the faltering stock market as 2 
trillion yen worth of postal insurance funds are set aside for 
stock investment through a special account. 
  The special account lends such funds to the Post Office Life 
Insurance and Annuities Welfare Corp., which comes under the 
Postal Ministry's jurisdiction. The corporation in turn places 
the funds with trust banks for stock investment. 
  The Postal Ministry has been negotiating with the Finance 
Ministry to allow it to invest in the stock market directly 
through the special account because a stock market slump makes 
it difficult for the corporation to pay back the interest on the 
borrowed money without selling assets held in stocks. 
  The special account lends postal insurance funds to the 
corporation for 10 years and the corporation places the money 
with trust banks for five years and is required to pay the 
interest every year on the money borrowed before August 1992. 
  The postal insurance funds lent by the special account to 
the 
corporation totaled 1.4 trillion yen in fiscal 1991, 1.67 
trillion yen in fiscal 1992 and 2 trillion yen in fiscal 1993. 
  The corporation, for its part, had losses totaling 44.6 
billion yen in fiscal 1992, forcing it carry over a loss of 10.3 
billion yen into fiscal 1993 although it tapped 34.3 billion yen 
in reserves against possible losses. 
  Postal life insurance is administered by the Postal Ministry 
and nearly 70 percent of the funds are placed with the Finance 
Ministry's Trust Fund Bureau as a major capital source for 
public works projects.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 8 KYODO -- Former Construction 
Minister Kishiro Nakamura, who allegedly received a payment in 
1992 from major construction firm Kajima Corp., played a key 
role in revising penalties in bid-rigging cases, informed 
sources said Saturday [8 January]. 
  The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) proposed in December 1991 to 
raise the maximum criminal fine from 5 million yen to more than 
100 million yen against firms which violated the Antimonopoly 
Law by bid-rigging, the sources said. The FTC was planning the 
revision following U.S. criticism of Japan's bidding system in 
the Structural Impediments Initiative talks. 
  Nakamura, then deputy chairman of a panel on the 
Antimonopoly 
Law in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), and other LDP 
legislators, who had close links to the construction industry, 
strongly opposed the FTC's plan. 
  Nakamura allegedly received an undeclared donation of 10 
million yen in mid-January 1992 from then Kajima Vice President 
Shinji Kiyoyama. 
  The LDP legislators, including Nakamura, stopped resistance 
to the plan in February 1992, the sources said. 
  The FTC submitted its revision plan on the law raising the 
maximum penalty to 100 million yen in March 1992 and the LDP 
panel accepted the plan. 
  A senior member of the LDP panel said the FTC set the amount 
after frequent contact with Nakamura, and another member said 
disgraced LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru directed the legislators to 
fix the amount at 100 million yen. 
  Meanwhile, the FTC was investigating a bid-rigging scandal 
involving public projects in Saitama Prefecture but in May 1992 
the commission announced it would not file a criminal complaint 
and ordered 66 companies to stop alleged unfair business 
practices. 
  A local executive of Kajima, one of Japan's three largest 
general contractors, reportedly served as head of a "club" of 
the 66 construction companies involved in bid-rigging in the 
prefecture. 
  Industry sources said there was a possibility that the FTC 
gave up filing criminal complaints in exchange for fixing the 
maximum fine at 100 million yen. FTC sources deny such a deal. 
  Kiyoyama and other top Kajima executives were arrested last 
year over the giving of bribes to then Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii 
and Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 8 KYODO -- The Transport Ministry will 
test launch two prototypes of next generation ultra-high-speed 
freighters as soon as construction is completed, ministry 
sources said Saturday [8 January]. 
  The freighters, dubbed as Techno Super Liner (TSL), which 
can 
sail at a speed of 90 kilometers per hour with a cruising range 
of some 1,000 kilometers, will be completed in June and March 
respectively, the sources said. 
  The two types of TSL -- a hovercraft freighter and a 
hydrofoil freighter -- will be capable of delivering 1,000-ton 
cargoes from Tokyo to the major islands of Hokkaido and Kyushu 
in half a day, they added. 
  The 1,590-ton prototype of the hovercraft freighter measures 
70 meters by 18 meters. This is half the size of the projected 
freighter to be commissioned in the mid or late 1990s, they said. 
  The 30-ton prototype of the hydrofoil freighter measures 17 
meters by 6 meters. This is one-sixth of the size of the 
projected freighter, to be commissioned around the same time. 
  The sources characterize the TSL as a cargo shinkansen 
bullet 
line that runs through the sea. 
  More than 10 prefectures, including Hokkaido, Aomori and 
Kagoshima, have already asked the ministry to designate them as 
major ports of call for the TSL. 
  The hovercraft freighter will be tested in Tokyo Bay 
immediately after its completion in late June. 
  It is now being manufactured as a joint project between the 
ministry, Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Co., and 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., the sources said. 
  The hydrofoil freighter, manufactured by another 
ministry-commissioned group of five major shipbuilders, led by 
Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., will be tested in Osaka Bay 
after its completion in late March, they said. 
  If the project is commercialized and there is sufficient 
demand for the service it would give a boost to the shipping 
industry, as the freighters could deliver a greater volume of 
cargo than trucks or planes. Both freighters cost more than 15 
billion yen. 
  It is expected among industry circles that the completion of 
the two types of freighters might make it possible to deliver 
cargo from Tokyo to Asia's newly industrializing countries in a 
day or two, at one-tenth the cost charged by conventional 
container vessels.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] held 
the first official contact with North Korea in Vienna, Austria, 
this morning and discussed the issue of resuming the inspections 
of the seven nuclear facilities North Korea had reported to the 
IAEA but a conclusion has not been reached. 
  The three North Korean representatives, including Yun 
Ho-chin, counselor of the North Korean Embassy in Vienna, 
visited the IAEA at 0000 this morning, Korean time, and 
delivered North Korea's official message containing its will 
[uisa] to accept overall inspections [chonmyon sachal]. Then, 
the North Korean representatives held the first official 
working-level contact with (Belcos), director of the IAEA 
Inspection Department, and negotiated working-level problems 
regarding the resumption of inspections of the reported seven 
nuclear facilities for two hours. 
  After the working-level negotiations, North Korean 
representatives revealed in an interview with KBS that even 
though the two sides have failed to reach an agreement, they 
held very productive negotiations. 
  Counselor Yun Ho-chin, North Korea's representative, said 
that during the official contact the two sides discussed their 
opinions regarding the resumption of inspections and shared 
opinions to settle the points at issue through negotiations so 
that inspections may be smoothly conducted. He said they agreed 
to meet once again early next week.

  [Text] Berlin, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) held its first official working-level 
contact with North Korea in Vienna on Friday on inspection of 
North Korean nuclear facilities, the IAEA announced. 
  The meeting was attended by Yun Ho-chin, a councilor at the 
North Korean Embassy in Vienna, and two other North Korean 
diplomats and by inspectors at IAEA Headquarters. The meeting 
lasted for two hours from 4 in the afternoon, it said. 
  "There had been the working-level contact (between North 
Korea and the IAEA) on problems related to inspection of North 
Korea's reported nuclear facilities," IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer 
said. "The two sides agreed to continue their contact early next 
week." 
  It has been reported that the two sides agreed in principle 
that they will resolve problems related to inspection activities 
through negotiation. 
  Sources said the North Korean officials conveyed Pyongyang's 
official position but the two sides could not reach any 
agreement on the scope and number of inspections or on the size 
of the inspection team and date of its visit to North Korea. 
  One North Korean official described Friday's meeting as 
"very 
productive," however, and said that there are some items left 
for further discussion and the two sides have decided to solve 
the problems, according to an IAEA official.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 8 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has accepted 
U.S. demands to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) to inspect its nuclear sites in principle, but with the 
proviso that the IAEA inspectors do not take samples of the fuel 
rods, the ASAHI SHIMBUN reported Saturday. 
  The IAEA is going to consult with North Korea on details of 
the inspection soon, and the United States is trying to persuade 
it to allow the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks 
to make a decision on the issue of taking samples, the daily 
newspaper quoted a South Korean Government source as saying. 
  North Korea said that, of its seven declared nuclear 
installations, it would rather not allow inspections of the 
5,000 kilowatt experimental reactor and radiochemical 
laboratory, according to the paper. 
  Pyongyang has insisted that it would never allow the 
inspectors to take samples from fuel rods, a process that is 
indispensable to measuring of the amount of plutonium that has 
been extracted. 
  The United States agreed to discuss the sample problem and 
special inspections of two undeclared sites in the high-level 
talks, the paper said. 
  At an inspection in 1992, the IAEA asked North Korea for 
fuel 
rod samples but was rebuffed. 
  "We had not prepared to halt our experimental reactors," 
they 
were told. "The crane to pull up the fuel rods is out of order." 
  With the North Korean condition, the IAEA is dissatisfied 
with the inspection, but the United States is persuading it that 
it is more important to solve the North Korean nuclear problem 
through dialogue, the ASAHI said.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan. 9 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) and North Korea, which had a working-level 
contact Friday, will need several more meetings to reach an 
accord on full-scope inspections of North Korea's seven declared 
nuclear sites. 
  One of these meetings will be early this week, possibly on 
Monday, an IAEA official said Sunday on condition of anonymity. 
  In Friday's meeting, North Korea said it would open just 
five 
of its nuclear facilities to IAEA inspectors. This was a 
reversal of the agreement reached in principle late last year 
with the United States on full inspections of all seven declared 
sites. 
  It is also a far cry from the IAEA demand for inclusion in 
the full-scope inspections of what are seen by the IAEA as two 
key facilities, a radiochemical laboratory (virtually a nuclear 
fuel reprocessing facility) and a 5-megawatt reactor, the 
official said. 
  The difference will be discussed in future meetings, in 
which 
inspection of the two key facilities will be a key issue along 
with the timing of the inspections and strength of the 
inspection team.

  [Text] Vienna, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Monday morning 
(local time) opened the second official working-level contact on 
matters related to IAEA inspection of North Korean nuclear 
facilities. 
  IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said that at the meeting, the IAEA 
produced to North Korea technical requirements related to 
nuclear inspections. 
  Meyer said the contact was going on between the two sides, 
and he could not discuss any details. 
  He added, however, he expects additional talks could take 
place this week on the inspection of the seven declared North 
Korean nuclear facilities. 
  Another IAEA spokesman, David Kyd, said he doesn't believe 
there would be any immediate progress over the question of 
inspecting two undeclared facilities. 
  North Korea was represented at the second contact held at 
the 
IAEA headquarters here in Vienna by Yun Ho-chin, a councilor at 
the North Korean embassy in Vienna, and a couple of other 
diplomats.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) is expected to wind up working-level 
negotiations on inspections of North Korean nuclear sites in a 
day or two and dispatch a team of inspectors to Pyongyang, a 
source said Monday. 
  The source quoted Vice Unification Minister Song Yong-tae as 
telling members of a National Assembly committee that when the 
IAEA team arrives in Pyongyang, South and North Korea and the 
United States will simultaneously announce their positions on 
three issues. 
  Song explained the government position on the process and 
prospects of Pyongyang-Washington negotiations to members of the 
National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification 
Committee in a meeting at the Federation of the Korean 
Industries, said the source who attended the meeting. 
  The three issues are inter-Korean exchange of special 
envoys, 
suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint South Korea-U.S. military 
exercise, and high-level talks between Pyongyang and Washington. 
  What the three countries will say about the issues has not 
been decided, and Washington seems unsure of Pyongyang's 
negotiating posture, a second source who also attended the 
meeting said. 
  When the IAEA inspectors arrive in Pyongyang, North Korea is 
expected to announce that it has decided to resume inter-Korean 
talks and is willing to open working-level contacts with the 
South to discuss mutual nuclear inspections based on the 
South-North non- nuclear declaration, he quoted National 
Unification Board officials as saying. 
  Seoul will announce that it is willing to suspend Team 
Spirit, while Washington will announce that it will hold a third 
round of high-level talks with Pyongyang on condition of the 
IAEA nuclear inspection and progress in inter-Korean talks. 
  An opposition Democratic Party lawmaker said: "I've heard 
that even if the government announces suspension of Team Spirit, 
it will make the final decision on when to suspend it after 
watching progress in inter-Korean talks and settlement of the 
North Korean nuclear problem."

delivered at city hall in Loikaw, Kayah State during his visit 
on 8 Jan] 
  [Excerpts] Lieutenant General Khin Nyunt, chairman of the 
Work Committee for Development of Border Areas and National 
Races and secretary-1 of the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council [SLORC], accompanied by Lt. Gen. Maung Thint, minister 
of development of border areas and national races; Brigadier

personnel left Yangon [Rangoon] on a defense services plane this 
morning. They arrived at Loikaw Airport in Kayah State at 0900 
in the morning. [passage omitted] 
  In his address Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that a delegation 
led 
by him visited Loikaw last September [month as heard], and 
during the meeting with town residents, native village leaders, 
and departmental personnel, the SLORC invited the jungle-based 
armed organizations to return to the legal fold so as to meet, 
coordinate, and to hold discussions for the reunification of 
national brethren. [passage omitted] 
  He added that Myanmar [Burma] is a union which comprises 
various indigenous nationals who reside together. Moreover, in 
Myanmar the indigenous nationals have been residing unitedly in 
the union through weal and woe for more than 1,000 years, and it 
is a country with its own culture. The colonialist-imperialists 
coveted the country's prosperity, and the abundant natural 
resources, staging three wars of aggression and enslaving 
Myanmar. [Passage omitted]. Although it has been over 40 years 
since independence, regions with the rule of law and tranquility 
have been developed to a certain extent, while regions infested 
with insurgency are still lagging behind. 
  He added that The SLORC's objectives are: the brethren who 
are indigenous nationals in the union must develop evenly, and 
all indigenous nationals must have a right to enjoy the taste of 
independence, which is achieved by all indigenous nationals 
joining hands and working unitedly. It is realized that 
national reconciliation is crucial in the implementation of 
these objectives. That is why, jungle-based armed organizations 
are invited to return to the legal fold. The state government 
has been extending this invitation with genuine goodwill and is 
intent on working for the consistent development of all states, 
including the border areas; allowing all the indigenous 
nationals to enjoy the taste of independence; and seeking the 
rapid development of the whole union. 
  He said that due to the invitation, the SLORC will meet and 
coordinate with some jungle-based armed organizations in the 
near future. The light of hope for peace is emerging. Every 
one has to continue to work for the full-fledged emergence of 
this light of hope for peace. In the upcoming meeting, the 
SLORC will participate with complete sincerity, and honesty. He 
added that, while people are needed to support this meeting 
actively and unitedly, the jungle-based armed organizations are 
also required to hold discussions with genuine goodwill and an 
honest attitude. These objectives will be accomplished for sure 
if both parties base their discussions on honesty, and loyalty. 
He also said that the cabinet ministers are accompanying him to 
accelerate development activities in Kayah State if it becomes 
peaceful and tranquil. 
  He said the light of peace is beginning to emerge in Kayah 
State and the SLORC is ready to implement rapid regional 
development in Kayah State once the region becomes stable and 
tranquil. The SLORC is simply explaining and presenting the 
state government's genuine attitude and intention to all the 
indigenous nationals. That is why all people, regardless of 
their race and religion, and all indigenous nationals who are 
residing in the Kayah State are needed to work together for the 
success of SLORC's objectives and aims. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Dispatch from Neil Kelly, correspondent in Bangkok] </F>
  [Text] Leaders of the Karenni [or Kayah] nationals in 
Burma have appealed to British Prime Minister John Major to 
intervene in their long struggle for independence. Meanwhile, 
other ethnic groups have been holding peace talks with the 
Burmese Government and the Karenni are in danger of becoming the 
only group left fighting the Burmese Government. 
  Karenni is a branch of the Karen ethnic group -- the biggest 
ethnic group in Burma. There are reports that Karens are on the 
threshold of ending its 45-year hostility against the Burmese 
Government. 
  In a letter to the Prime Minister's Office in London's 
Downing Street, the Karenni provisional government based in 
northern Thailand, has appealed to the British Government to 
play a leading role in supervising their peace talks with 
Rangoon. The letter of appeal also said that the Karenni State 
would have been given protection by the British Government had 
the Conservative government been in power when Burma gained 
independence from Britain in 1948. The letter also cited 
documents which stated that the Karenni State was a British 
protectorate during the colonial era and was never a part of the 
Indian Empire or Burma. 
  Britain's official view is that the official representatives 
of the Karenni State, which now has a population of over 
300,000, chose the path of independence and to jointly work with 
Burma at the time of independence. 
  In an interview with the BBC, the Karenni foreign minister, 
Abel Tweed, said he wanted Britain to mediate in the peace 
talks. He said Britain has growing sympathy for the Karenni, and 
that it could still do a lot for the Karenni's goal. 
  The Karenni has appealed in the past to Britain, India, and 
Australia to recognize them as an independent state. Abel Tweed 
also said that although the low-level preliminary peace talks 
are being held with the Burmese Government at a secret venue 
inside Karenni territory, full-scale peace talks could not be 
held as long as the Burmese troops are not withdrawn from 
Karenni territory and the forceful recruitment of porters and 
interrogation and imprisonment of people continue.

  [Excerpts] THE Burmese junta's calls for ceasefire 
negotiations with armed ethnic groups have started to bear fruit 
with the Karen, Karenni and Mon -- the final hold-out minorities 
-- either being pressed to enter talks or already tied to a 
"loose truce" with Rangoon. [passage omitted] 
  "Since the beginning of this year (1993), we have come under 
increasing pressure from some Thai sources, most probably in the 
line with the Thai government policy of constructive engagement 
with Slorc," leaders of the three ethnic groups said in a signed 
joint letter to one of Thailand's highest institutions. 
  "Some forms of pressure involve the threat to push our 
refugees back into the war zone or cut off food supplies, and 
restricting our travel for medical treatment ... 
  "Our understanding is that for positive or constructive 
results, pressure should be applied equally to both sides. 
  "Actions perceived as not evenhanded could only be 
counter-productive," they said. 
  A copy of the Dec 3 letter signed by Karen leader Gen Bo 
Mya, 
Karenni leader Saw Maw Reh and Mon leader Nai Shwe Kyin was 
obtained by THE NATION. [passage omitted] 
  According to well-informed border sources, the Mon and Slorc 
agreed at a meeting late last year in Moulmein, in Burma's Mon 
State, to an "unofficial" or "loose truce deal". The deal 
effectively ends the fighting in southern Burma's Thaton, Mergui 
and Tavoy areas. 
  Several more rounds of talks are needed to finalise details 
before an actual truce agreement can be concluded, said the 
sources. 
  Burmese southern commander Maj Gen Ket Sein headed the 
Burmese negotiating team while Nai Htaw Mon a senior military 
affairs officer, led the Mon delegation to the Moulmein meeting. 
  Meanwhile, the Karenni have delegated a three-member mission 
to meet Slorc officials this week, according to a senior Karenni 
leader, Abel Tweed. 
  He said Karenni Deputy Army Chief Maj Aung Mya will head the 
team, which also includes Karenni officials Paulu and Shan Reh, 
to a "preliminary meeting" in Daw Gnew Khu, a small border 
village of about two-days walk from the Thai border. 
  Tweed said no agenda has been set. The forum will look into 
the possibilities of further talks. 
  Tweed conceded that the bilateral talks could eventually 
lead 
to a military ceasefire, but said the Karenni National 
Progressive Party has not abandoned its political objective of 
an independent Karenni state. 
  He expressed the hope that future peace talks would be held 
in Thailand, and said the Karenni mistrust Slorc too much to 
ever go to Rangoon. 
  "They (Slorc) refused to meet in Bangkok or Chiang Mai but 
if 
there is some progress from the (first) meeting then we may have 
the next talks in Thailand... Thai authorities are willing to 
host peace talks either in Chiang Mai or Mae Hong Son if both 
sides agree," said Tweed. 
  Sources said the Burmese armed forces attache in Bangkok, 
Col 
Thein Swe, travelled to Mae Hong Son at the end of last year to 
propose that the two sides meet. 
  As for the Karen, their leader Gen Bo Mya sent a letter last 
week to Prime Minister Chuan Likphai urging the Thai government 
to "persuade" or "pressure" Slorc to enter into a peace dialogue 
with the collective ethnic opposition. 
  An informed border source said that the Karen group has 
finally agreed to meet Rangoon officials to seek out common 
ground for further truce negotiations. 
  The source said the group has already appointed a team to 
engage in "preliminary talks" with Slorc. 
  It was not known when they will meet. The source added that 
Gen Bo Mya at a meeting last Friday with a senior Thai security 
general urged Thailand to host the Karen-Slorc talks. 
  Bo Mya sent a similar letter, which bears his title as 
chairman of the Democratic Alliance of Burma (DAB), to Foreign 
Minister Prasong Sunsiri and Interior Minister Gen Chawalit 
Yongchaiyut. [passage omitted] 
  In his letter, Bo Mya accused Slorc of trying to disunite 
the 
opposition and warned Rangoon's policy of approaching individual 
groups would not lead to "a stable peace" or a "comprehensive 
solution" to the problems in Burma. 
  "Slorc's insistence, needless to say, could only be viewed 
as 
a crude attempt to divide the resistance forces and, at the same 
time, to improve its international image," he said. 
  "Moreover, Slorc's approach would never lead to a stable 
peace as desired by the people, and a comprehensive solution to 
the problems besetting the country. 
  "Whatever the circumstances, the DAB is the only 
organisation 
that can bring about general reconciliation and peace in the 
whole country. 
  "If you have the means to persuade or make pressure bear on 
Slorc, we would like to urge you to use it for the emergence of 
a peace negotiation between the Slorc and the DAB as a whole," 
said the Karen leader.

  [Text] Malaysia is urging the United Nations to allow 
troops from Muslim countries to serve as UNPROFOR [United 
Nations Protection Force] peacekeepers in Bosnia if Western 
countries withdraw their forces. Foreign Minister Datuk 
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said in Kepala Batas that reports that 
several Western countries wanted to withdraw their peacekeeping 
troops from Bosnia were the most serious development. As such, 
he said Malaysia does not want the withdrawal to cause a vacuum 
which could be detrimental for the Bosnians who are under 
Serbian insurgency. 
  Datuk Abdullah added that Britain, France, and Canada were 
among several countries which had warned that they might pull 
out from UNPROFOR if the chaotic situation continued in Bosnia 
and was endangering their forces. He said Malaysia viewed the 
statements with concern and hoped the UN would not allow the 
Bosnians to be left without any means to defend themselves. Any 
vacuum, apart from complicating the security situation, would 
also jeopardize UNPROFOR's role in the dispatch of food, 
clothing, and medical needs. He also urged the UN to lift its 
arms embargo imposed on former Yugoslavia to enable the Bosnians 
to secure weapons to defend their nation.

  [Text] On 6 January His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, 
president of the Democratic Kampuchea Party [DKP], sent a 
telegram to Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, president of 
FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, 
Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], in reply to the latter's 
letter of 1 January. The telegram reads as follows: 
  Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, FUNCINPEC president, 
Phnom Penh 
  Respected Samdech Krompreah: I would like to acknowledge 
receipt, with deep and sincere thanks, of Samdech Krompreah's 
letter of 1 January 1994. May I be permitted to make the 
following clarifications? 
  I. The points we agreed upon at our meeting on 17 December 
1993 discussed the basis (?that) the cause to be pursued must be 
the five-point guideline set forth by His Majesty [H.M.] the 
King. As Samdech Krompreah is fully aware, this five-point 
guideline clearly stipulates the following: 
  1. An immediate and complete cease-fire over the whole 
territory of Cambodia; 
  2. An immediate and unconditional transfer of the Preah 
Vihear temple, Pailin, and other Democratic Kampuchea-controlled 
zones to the state and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia; 
  3. The dissolution of the National Army of Democratic 
Kampuchea [NADK] and its partial inclusion into the Royal Army 
of Cambodia; 
  4. The government shall in return give the post of 
co-ministers, co-vice ministers, co-secretaries of state, and 
advisers to acceptable personalities of the DKP. H.M. the King 
would appoint a Democratic Kampuchea high-ranking personality as 
his senior personal adviser; 
  5. The DKP and the government must hold talks to settle all 
the issues. 
  The points of the five-point guideline cannot be separated 
one from the other. These five points form a single body to be 
simultaneously dealt with altogether. H.M. the King has pointed 
out that the DKP alone cannot make any progress. The 
government, for its part, must do something through talks. 
  The essence is clear, that is, the first three points are 
what the DKP must give to the other side, and the last two 
points are what the government must give to the DKP in return. 
Altogether these five points make national reconciliation 
possible. On the contrary, if one side insists on the other 
three points, then the other two points cannot be fulfilled. By 
the same token, if the DKP demands only the two points for 
itself, then the three points cannot be fulfilled either. In so 
doing, the five-point guideline cannot be [as heard] 
materialized. 
  II. As Samdech Krompreah has been fully aware all along, the 
Vietnamese communists and the Phnom Penh party have for a long 
time insisted on their points, namely: 
  1. An unconditional cease-fire by the national resistance 
forces; 
  2. The handing over of Democratic Kampuchea-controlled zones 
to the Vietnamese-controlled Phnom Penh party; 
  3. The dissolution of the NADK, which is an important 
component of the national resistance forces. 
  Samdech Krompreah may also be well aware of the the fact 
that 
our Cambodian nation and people, like the DKP, have not 
accepted, nor can they accept, these conditions set by the 
Vietnamese communists and the Phnom Penh party. Our tripartite 
national resistance forces have also unequivocally rejected 
them, for they are like a guillotine beheading the national 
resistance forces enabling the Vietnamese communists and the 
Phnom Penh party to perpetuate their occupation of Cambodia. 
This would amount to blotting out our Cambodian nation and 
people. 
  The three points of the Vietnamese communists and the Phnom 
Penh party are the opposite of the five-point guideline of H.M. 
the King. The former are a scheme aimed at continuing the war in 
Cambodia, while the five points would lead to national 
reconciliation. The five-point guideline aims at true national 
reconciliation without excluding any national force. The DKP 
would (?thus) be included so that there would be sufficient 
national forces within the army and the government in order to 
make them truly national forces. And all the national forces 
would work together to tackle the present situation, which is 
worsening day by day, so that peace, independence, national 
unity, and territorial integrity could be restored. 
  I sincerely believe that Samdech Krompreah personally wishes 
to support the five-point guideline of H.M. the King as well. 
However, the Vietnamese communists and the Phnom Penh party 
have been resorting to all sorts of maneuvers and pressures to 
ensure that only the three points are singled out, the aim of 
which is to dismantle the DKP according to their dark and dirty 
scheme. They categorically oppose Cambodian national 
reconciliation since the strategy of the Vietnamese communists 
and their lackeys is to swallow up Cambodia through a military 
war and a war conducted by sending massive Vietnamese nationals 
into the country and to the state power they installed in 1979, 
which is now running Cambodia. 
  Thus, as far as the technical group is concerned, and as 
Samdech Kromopreah is fully aware, we had reached an agreement 
according to which that group should have no name at all. 
  I would like to recall that at that time I proposed that the 
technical group be formed by the representatives of the DKP and 
FUNCINPEC. However, in case the representatives of the 
Cambodian People's Party are also included, then those of the 
[words indistinct] democratic parties should be brought in as 
well. 
  The content of Samdech Krompreah's communication of 1 
January 
1994 has departed from this point of agreement we reached on 17 
December last and did not give an answer to my letter of 28 
December which I addressed to you. I would like to propose that 
we should proceed as fast as we can on the basis of what we 
achieved on 17 December 1993, that is, the points of agreement 
which I have recalled above. 
  Please accept, Samdech Krompreah, my high and respectful 
consideration. 
  [Signed] Khieu Samphan, president of the DKP 
  [Dated] 6 January 1994

  [Text] A government official has disclosed that the heads 
of the royal government of the Kingdom of Cambodia [KOC], Prince 
Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister; and Hun Sen, 
KOC second prime minister; and a number of ministers, state 
secretaries, under state secretaries, and leading officials will 
pay an official visit to the PRC from 17 January. 
  This trip by the two heads of the royal government of 
Cambodia [RGC] is made at the invitation of His Excellency 
[H.E.] Li Peng, PRC prime minister. It is also their first 
joint visit since the official establishment of the royal 
government on 29 September 1993. 
  It ought to be specified that during this trip to China, the 
two RGC heads will probably inform King Norodom Sihanouk, who is 
receiving medical treatment in Beijing, of the royal 
government's major plans, projects, and principles for 1994. 
  Political analysts on the Cambodia issue have affirmed that 
during this visit to Beijing by the two RGC heads -- made after 
the attack by Khmer Rouge troops on Romchang village in the 
liberated zone of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an 
Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] on 1 
January -- discussion and consultation with the king will 
probably be held concerning the Khmer Rouge, who also want a 
role in the royal government, because China in the past was a 
major supporter of the Khmer Rouge.

  [Excerpts] Phnom Penh, Jan 8 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge 
guerrillas and government forces traded fire across the main 
road to Cambodia's port of Sihanoukville holding up traffic for 
more than 30 minutes, a police officer said Saturday. 
  A group of 60 guerrillas seized a stretch of the road about 
mid-way between the port and the capital early Friday. 
  The guerrillas proceeded to hold up cars and rob their 
occupants, the police official said. [passage omitted] 
  Government forces were sent to the area and traffic was held 
up as the two sides exchanged fire. 
  After some 30 minutes the government troops managed to repel 
the guerrillas, who retreated into nearby forest, and cars were 
allowed pass, the police officer said. 
  The officer had no information on casualties. 
  Another police officer said that the guerrillas were 
"probably angry" because the government forces had recently 
attacked their bases in Kompong Speu Province which lies between 
the capital and the Sihanoukville. 
  Government forces bombarded Kompong Speu Province Saturday 
with leaflets urging the guerrillas to defect, a military 
official said. 
  One of the leaflets carried an appeal from co-premiers 
Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen which urges the guerrillas " to 
stop following the belligerent policy of the Khmer Rouge 
hardliners which will be disastrous for the national society of 
the whole Kingdom of Cambodia" and called on them to defect 
quickly. 
  Printed on the other side of the leaflets were several 
colour 
photos of a smiling Ranariddh shaking hands and handing out 
clothing to guerrillas who had defected. 
  The text of a second leaflet from the military called on the 
guerrillas to desert as soon as possible to avoid a "forthcoming 
confrontation". 
  Meanwhile Thai immigration officials said they had closed 
the 
border crossing at Poipet as government forces attacked nearby 
Khmer Rouge positions in northwestern Banteay Meanchey Province. 
It was the first reported clash after a three day lull in the 
fighting in the area. 
  Government and Khmer Rouge guerrillas had clashed daily 
since 
Thai military officials reported the government had launched an 
offensive on the guerrillas' bases starting New Year's day. 
  Meanwhile Minister of Tourism Veng Sereivut said Saturday 
that "specific measures" were to be taken to ensure security 
along the road to Sihanoukville. 
  He refused to elaborate but said the defence and interior 
ministries had been instructed to do everything possible to 
maintain security along the vital road. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Phnom Penh -- THE Cambodian government hopes 
Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's visit this week will encourage 
reputable Thai businessmen to invest in Cambodia and result in 
the departure of business "cowboys", Cambodian Minister for 
Economics and Finance Sam Rainsy said yesterday. 
  Among the preferred investors he named Sahawiriya, Dusit 
Thani Group and Ital-Thai. Representatives from these companies 
will be in a delegation of about 50 businessmen who will 
accompany Chuan to Cambodia on Wednesday. 
  "We hope that these groups will come to replace (some) 
existing bad ones," Rainsy told THE NATION. 
  "Prestigious and honourable businessmen will only come when 
there is a clear situation and transparency," said Rangsi. 
  "We have not seen prestigious Thai investors in Cambodia -- 
only middlemen or brokers who came and got licences (to do 
business) unfairly through private arrangements." [passage 
omitted] 
  While maintaining that not all Thai businessmen are bad, 
Rangsi likened some of them to cowboys intent on plundering the 
Indians in the far west without respect for the law, regulations 
sovereignty or national identity. 
  "If you send only cowboys to Cambodia to look down on us as 
the far west, you will not have peace and friendship. In 
return, the Indians will rebel against you," he warned. 
  Rangsi singled out the Floating Hotel as the worst case, 
because it was allowed to operate without an official contract. 
  He did not say to what extent other Thai businesses would be 
affected, but said the government would look into ways of 
putting all previous contracts into the regular system. 
  "They will also have to adapt to the new situation," he 
said. 
  However the minister admitted the government would have to 
rely on Thai investors given the similarity of their experience 
in economic development which Thailand went through 20 years ago. 
  He hopes that by learning from the Thai experience, Cambodia 
can catch up to the present level of development in Thailand 
within 10 years. 
  "I hope we will not need 20 years if we can learn to follow, 
or to avoid, what Thailand went through," Rangsi said. 
  During Chuan's three-day visit he will sign an agreement to 
set up a Joint Commission on bilateral relations. 
  The Thai businessmen will also attend the first major 
seminar 
on prospects for trade and investment in Cambodia since the new 
government took power in November. The seminar will be jointly 
hosted by Thailand's Board of lnvestment and Cambodia's newly- 
established National Investment Committee (NIC). 
  The government of Cambodia is set to finalize by the end of 
this month its first investment law, which is crucial to provide 
a conducive environment for much-needed foreign investors, said 
Rangsi. 
  He said the government is also preparing to sign specific 
bilateral agreements on investment cooperation with each foreign 
government if such deals are needed to provide more secure 
investment for them. 
  "It (the investment law) will be very easy and transparent 
and includes provisions that leave no room for interpretation 
and corruption. The law will be the same for everybody," said 
Rangsi. 
  Basically, the law will provide more incentives for foreign 
investment in the government-encouraged sectors, helping create 
jobs and train inexperienced Cambodians. 
  The minister cited as priority projects the processing 
industry, namely rubber plant, food processing and furniture 
factories. Among incentives to investment are five-year 
business and corporate tax holidays, tax exemptions for the 
import of raw materials and transferring of profits back to the 
home countries. [passage omitted] 
  Rangsi asked Thailand to help give Cambodians expertise in 
tax collecting and training on customs procedures. 
  He will raise the request with his Thai counterpart Tharin 
Nimmanhemin, who is accompanying Chuan. 
  The minister said he already wrote Tharin about such 
requests 
following their meeting at the World Bank and IMF meeting in New 
York in October.

  [Text] Yesterday [8 January], Samdech Chea Sim, acting 
head of state and chairman of the National Assembly, visited 
troops of the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] in Division 1 in 
the Kirirom area and also visited the area's major tourist 
sites. Accompanying him on this trip were His Excellency 
General Tie Banh, co-defense minister; princes; excellencies; 
and many officials from the National Defense Ministry. 
  Speaking on this occasion, Samdech Chea Sim most cordially 
and warmly enquired about life in the KRAF's Division 1, which 
is stationed in Kirirom. He further said that there are two 
tasks for Division 1: first, defend the Kirirom area and protect 
the local natural resources; and second, build bridges and roads 
coming into Kirirom. Samdech Chea Sim also called on the 
officers and men in charge of the entire area to continue 
further heightening their spirit of responsibility in the 
protection of the area's natural resources as well as in the 
speedy and timely construction of roads and bridges leading to 
the Kirirom area. He also appealed to Division 1 to strengthen 
and expand national unity with forces from all political parties 
in order to become the KRAF under the direct leadership of the 
Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  Samdech Chea Sim also distributed some gifts in the form of 
foodstuff to officers and men stationed in the Kirirom area.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 7 January at the office of the 
Cambodian People's Party [CPP], a meeting was held to mark the 
15th anniversary of the 7 January 1979 victory day. 
High-ranking leaders of the CPP attending this meeting were His 
Excellency [H.E.] Heng Samrin, the party's honorary chairman; 
H.E. Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the party Central Committee; 
H.E. Hun Sen, vice chairman of the party Central Committee; 
members of the standing committee and of the CPP Central 
Committee; and thousands of CPP members. Furthermore, 
personalities representing a number of political parties taking 
part in the May 1993 general elections; representatives of 
international organizations; ambassadors of some countries in 
Cambodia; and representatives of the clergy, intellectuals, 
students, workers, farmers, ethnic groups, and the armed forces 
were also invited to attend. 
  Speaking at this big meeting H.E. Heng Samrin, CPP honorary 
chairman, stressed that we always remember the great and 
energetic movement of our people throughout the country under 
the banner of the front for national salvation of Cambodia and 
the leadership of the CPP that helped save the nation and the 
motherland and won back the rights, freedom, and hope that were 
lost. As a result, conditions were created for the revival of 
various achievements that had been brought about after national 
independence 40 years ago. 
  H.E. Heng Samrin affirmed that without the 7 January 1979 
victory day, the history of our country and nation -- famous for 
building the wonderful Angkor civilization -- would have been 
very unjustly concluded. H.E. Heng Samrin said proudly that we 
now have a progressive constitution genuinely born of the 
people's aspiration. We have rebuilt the Kingdom of Cambodia 
under the banner of Nation, Religion, and King, which is the the 
symbol of solidarity, peace, and progress. Under the roof of 
the constitution, our land and people are united; no person or 
force can break up our land and people. Going against this goal 
is a crime that can destroy the nation -- one which the 
Cambodian people cannot tolerate. 
  At the end of his speech H.E. Heng Samrin stressed heavily 
that: 
  [Begin Heng Samrin recording] The brilliant results achieved 
by our people are certainly most worthy of pride. However, this 
is only the preliminary and necessary basis for our motherland's 
long process. Although vigorous demands to raise economic and 
social living standards are being made, many large obstacles, 
and minor ones, confront us. If we are negligent and lack 
vigilance or make any mistakes, this can certainly push society 
and the nation back to the great disaster of the past. 
Therefore, all of us should clearly understand the significance 
and the main goals of this historic phase. We should strive to 
hold aloft the banner of national independence and the banner of 
great national solidarity to unite the nation with the aim of 
vigorously rallying all kinds of forces from all circles to 
defend the nation; building peace, unity, and stability; and 
promoting social rehabilitation and development. 
  On this solemn occasion, on behalf of the CPP, we would like 
to appeal to the clergy, all religious followers, intellectuals, 
pupils, students, civil servants and officials, workers, 
employees, the Khmer Royal Armed Forces, the national police, 
artisans, artists, traders of all ethnic groups, and all 
citizens in and outside the country to unite around the king; 
firmly abide by the constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia; 
actively take part in successfully implementing the political 
program of the Royal Government; and strive to defend the social 
and national achievements in order to reinforce the foundation 
of happiness and prosperity of our nation. We appeal to various 
parties, all social forces, and various political forces to 
sincerely cooperate in implementing multiparty liberal democracy 
by putting the supreme interests of the nation and people above 
everything else. 
  We appeal to all countries the world over, international 
organizations, and various nongovernmental organizations to 
continue providing all manner of assistance and support to the 
poor Cambodian people to help them restore and rebuild the land. 
  The 7 January spirit will forever remain in the soul of the 
people. It is a voice reminding all Cambodians to strive to 
preserve national solidarity in order to defend and build their 
history and make it shine. The 7 January spirit has again 
linked us to the nation's past glory and has created a new 
revival force moving toward a brilliant future. The 7 January 
spirit is an excellent example of our nation's genuine 
patriotism. Without the 7 January 1979 day, there would be no 
life today. [end Heng Samrin recording) [applause]

  [Text] Banda Aceh, Indonesia, Jan 8 (AFP) -- Hundreds of 
Indonesian fishermen in the nortwestern province of Aceh have 
attacked several Thai boats off the province's west coast, but 
no casualties were reported, a source said here Saturday. 
  Armed with Molotov bombs and metal weapons, the local 
fishermen aboard some 30 to 45 motor boats Friday attacked 
several Thai boats operating in the waters off the west coast of 
Aceh, the source said. 
  "Several Thai fishermen were injured, but there were no 
casualties," the source said. 
  Deputy Police Chief Major Wahid confirmed the report. 
  A fisherman blamed the attack on the marine authorities for 
their alleged lack of response to reports in the last six months 
that an increasing number of Thai boats have been operating in 
Indonesian territorial waters. 
  The fisherman alleged that Indonesian Navy officials based 
in 
Sabang had protected the Thai fishermen. 
  The fisherman quoted a Navy official as saying that "the 
Thai 
fishermen have the permit to fish around the waters of the 
exclusive economic zone." 
  But the fisherman said that "in fact, they fish only two 
miles from the coast, using trawls, which have been banned by 
the government," the fisherman said. 
  Sabang Navy Base Commander Lieutenant Colonel Azmi Idris 
told 
AFP that the Thai fishermen were cooperating with the navy. 
  However, Indonesian marine patrols last month nabbed Thai 
fishing crews for alleged illegal fishing about 360 kilometers 
(223 miles) off Aceh. 
  The Thai fishermen held three Indonesian policemen hostage 
for five hours following the arrest of their colleagues. 
  They demanded to exchange the three police officers for the 
16 Thai fishing boat crews the police had arrested earlier. 
  The three policemen were released after an exchange of fire 
between the Thai fishermen and a police team specially deployed 
to free the hostages. 
  Reports also said that Indonesian fishermen in Aceh had been 
repeatedly shot at by Thai fishing boats armed with modern 
fishing equipment.

  [Text] The Indonesian Government has temporarily barred 
anyone from visiting East Timor rebel leader Xanana Gusmao in 
prison. The indefinite decision also applies to his relatives 
and officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross 
[ICRC]. Baharuddin Lopa, director general for corrections of 
the Justice Department, told reporters in Jakarta this afternoon 
that the decision was made because Xanana had discredited 
Indonesia's reputation in the international community by sending 
a letter to the Portuguese Government and the International 
Commission of Justice. 
  Baharuddin Lopa said the Indonesian Government was generous 
enough to allow Xanana's family and ICRC officials to see him 
without the presence of any Indonesian official. Xanana, 
however, had abused the generosity by smuggling out the letter. 
  According to Baharuddin Lopa, an agreement will 
automatically 
become null and void if either party violates it under 
international law. In the wake of the incident, the director 
general for corrections has instructed his subordinates to 
closely guard Xanana in case the rebel leader is again allowed 
to receive visitors.

  [Excerpt] Cotabato City -- The Moro Islamic Liberation 
Front (MILF) has offered its help to hunt the suspects in the 
recent bombing of a Catholic Cathedral and three mosques in 
Davao City which it said were a "machination" to bring 
Christians and Muslims at war. 
  This developed as Southern Command chief Major General 
Thelmo 
Cunanan endorsed an investigation of the relatives of the 
victims in the 26 December bombing of the cathedral to find out 
if they have knowledge in the "retaliatory" attacks on the 
mosques. 
  "Let us join together to identify (those involved) and bring 
them into the open to expose their evil agenda and let them 
answer their ungodly and barbaric acts," MILF spokesman Mohagher 
Iqbal said in a press statement on Tuesday. 
  But Iqbal warned the government to avoid "witchhunting as 
what had happened in the Buluan massacre," an incident that also 
almost sparked a Muslim-Christian conflict. 
  Iqbal was referring to the 13 December ambush-massacre in 
which 10 bus passengers were killed and 10 others wounded in 
Buluan, Maguindanao which the military blamed to a certain MILF 
Kumander [Commander] Ustadz Dua Mantio. 
  "Kumander Dua was made the sacrificial lamb for a crime he 
was never involved in," Iqbal said, adding that Dua was found 
innocent of the charges in an MILF initiated investigation. 
  Iqbal said the Davao City bombings were "befitting only to 
barbarians, ungodly and bloodthirsty" who "deserve the highest 
condemnation of every sane, upright and God-believing individual 
or group." 
  The MILF spokesman also appealed to the people of Davao City 
and nearby areas to "observe sobriety, patience and perseverance 
in the face of this machination to drive a wedge between our 
peoples." 
  In the same statement, Iqbal reaffirmed the MILF support to 
the on-going peace talks between its rival Moro National 
Liberation Front and the government, which he considered a hope 
leading to the implementation of the 1976 Tripoli Agreement. 
  "If any group cannot contribute to this forward move (peace 
talks), at least it must stop rocking the boat of peace and 
autonomy," Iqbal said.

  [Text] Commenting on the allegation that Thailand is 
supporting the Khmer Rouge in the fighting between the Cambodian 
Government and the Khmer Rouge faction, Foreign Minister 
Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said this comment was made by 
people who are ignorant of the facts and that it is not 
constructive. He said Thailand has not supported the Khmer 
Rouge since the peace agreement was signed in Paris. 
  [Begin Prasong recording, in progress] ...not supporting any 
party. Our support for the tripartite faction was suspended 
when the peace agreement was signed in Paris. Those people at 
the local level in Cambodia who are responsible for such 
allegations should think about making more constructive 
comments. Thailand wants to see reconciliation among the 
Cambodian people so that national reconstruction can be 
achieved. Comments that are not constructive only cause 
misunderstanding. [end recording] 
  Touching on the Thai prime minister's upcoming visit to 
Cambodia, the foreign minister said they would discuss 
Thai-Cambodian relations with the Cambodian leaders. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, meanwhile, granted 
an interview to reporters concerning the call made by Prince 
Norodom Sirivut, Cambodian deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, for Thailand to clarify with Cambodia its position 
regarding the Khmer Rouge during the Thai prime minister's 
upcoming visit to Cambodia on Wednesday. Minister Surin said he 
did not think Thailand would make any clarifications, because 
the matter is over and Thailand's position is clear. Concerning 
the weapons arsenal, the deputy foreign minister admitted that 
Cambodia wanted the weapons left over in Thailand, but this is 
not the Thai Government's policy. 
  [Begin Surin recording, in progress] ...support from 
outside. 
Whatever happened inside Cambodia, we never interfered. We 
support and recognize only one government; that is, the elected 
government in Phnom Penh. Concerning the leakage of weapons, 
this could happen. But we will try to correct the situation. 
The Thai Government has a clear position and has never deviated 
from that policy. You can be sure of that. And I believe the 
world in general has a correct understanding of that issue.

  [Excerpt] Thai businessmen involved in logging in Cambodia 
will have until March 31 to bring out their wood under the 
deadline extended by the Phnom Penh government, according to a 
report brought to the attention of state agencies last week. 
  Thai Government sources said the new deadline was discussed 
at a joint meeting of representatives of the Interior and the 
Foreign ministries, the National Security Council, the Army the 
Customs and Forestry departments and the Immigration Police. 
  The Foreign Ministry told the meeting that Cambodian Finance 
Minister Sam Rangsi had informed them that Phnom Penh had 
extended the deadline from December 31 to March 31. 
  The Interior Ministry asked the Foreign Ministry to confirm 
the new deadline to enable it to extend the opening of temporary 
border passes to allow importation of the wood. 
  The meeting agreed it would help Thailand if agencies 
involved were able to negotiate with Phnom Penh to extend new 
logging concessions to Thai businessmen after the deadline. 
  Thailand now needs 9.4 million cubic metres of wood 
annually. 
It has been importing three million cubic metres each year.

  [Text] Khachatphai Burutphat, deputy secretary general of 
the National Security Council [NSC], talks about the problem of 
Burmese refugees fleeing the danger of war into Thailand's 
border areas since 1984. He says there are about 50,000 of them 
in Tak Province, 10,000 in Kanchanaburi Province, and several 
thousands in Mae Hong Son and Prachuap Khirikhan Provinces. 
Under the original plan, these people will be sent back to 
Burma once the situation has improved and there is no fighting. 
But they have not been sent back yet because they claim that 
the situation in Burma is never safe for them. 
  The NSC deputy secretary general said these Burmese refugees 
have been here for more than 10 years now. They received help 
from seven or eight private organizations, the so-called NGO 
[preceding word in English], which have been allowed to carry 
out operations without strict control by Thai authorities. Some 
of those NGO officials are involved in political activities with 
the refugees. Certain organizations used Thailand, which has 
diplomatic relations with Burma, as a transit point for certain 
leaders of the resistance ethnic minority groups to leave for a 
third country where they can launch resistance activities 
against the Burmese Government. Such an act could affect 
relations between Thailand and Burma as well as security along 
the Thai border. 
  In order to promptly control these refugees, Khachatphai 
Burutphat said that concerned authorities would form an 
apparatus in order to oversee these people. At the beginning, 
existing officials will be told to take strict action against 
them. The new agency to be set up will deal with these refugees 
based on humanitarian principles, but it will not permit them to 
engage in any kind of activities in violation of Thai law or 
activities which will affect security along the Thai-Burmese 
border.

  [Text] A Chinese military delegation led by General Liu 
Huaqing, vice chairman of the Chinese Central Military 
Commission, arrived in Bangkok yesterday for a six-day goodwill 
visit to Thailand at the invitation of the Thai Supreme Command. 
  At 1647 yesterday, his majesty the king granted an audience 
to Gen. Liu Huaqing, who was accompanied by Supreme Commander 
Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari, at the grand place. 
  At 1700, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai received Gen. Liu 
Huaqing and his entourage at Government House. 
  During the talks, Gen. Liu Huaqing thanked the prime 
minister 
and the Supreme Command for the warm reception accorded to his 
delegation. He felt greatly honored by an audience with his 
majesty the king. 
  Gen. Liu Huaqing said that his delegation's visit to 
Thailand 
is aimed at promoting friendly relations between the Thai and 
Chinese peoples. He stressed that the friendship between the 
Thai and Chinese peoples is fraternal. 
  Gen. Liu Huaqing also praised Thailand's rapid economic 
development. China is devoting itself to construction in all 
fields and is giving special attention to economic reform. 
  Gen. Liu Huaqing stressed that China's military buildup is 
aimed at self-defense. China will never seek hegemony. Like 
Thailand, China hopes to see peace and stability in the 
Asia-Pacific region. On the occasion, he also conveyed Chinese 
Prime Minister Li Peng's best regards to Prime Minister Chuan. 
  Prime Minister Chuan welcomed the visit of Gen. Liu Huaqing 
and his delegation to Thailand. He said that the Chinese 
military leader's visit to Thailand will further promote 
relations between Thailand and China, especially closer military 
contacts. 
  Prime Minister Chuan praised the achievements in China's 
construction. He said that China has experience and capability 
in producing weapons. Thailand still needs to buy weapons from 
China. He said that he had visited the Shanghai Zhonghua 
Shipyard to observe the construction of Thai ships during his 
recent visit to China. Chuan praised China for playing a vital 
role in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific 
region, especially its contribution to the restoration of peace 
in Cambodia. It was commendable that China also achieved the 
fastest economic growth rate in the world last year. 
  After the talks, Prime Minister Chuan conferred the Order of 
the Knight, First Class, on Gen. Liu Huaqing for his important 
contributions to the friendly relations between the armed forces 
and peoples of the two countries.

ordered by the Navy are now under construction in China. 
  ACM Woranat also said that Thailand has no policy of setting 
up refugee holding centers along the border. Any rumors 
regarding such a matter are untrue.

Natural Resources of the U.S. Senate led by its chairman J. 
Bennett Johnston who arrived here yesterday morning. 
  During the reception, Senator J.B. Johnston thanked General 
Secretary Do Muoi and Vietnamese agencies for their hospitality

  Mr. Johnston expressed his satisfaction at the results of

  [Text] A delegation of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Commission [as heard] is on a visit to Vietnam. The 
delegation includes seven senators. While they were in Hanoi, 
six senators of the delegation met with Vietnamese and foreign 
press men. Following is the report about this press conference, 
held in Hanoi on Sunday: 
  At the press conference, all American senators welcomed the 
Vietnamese Government and people's goodwill in cooperation with 
the United States side to settle the MIA issue. They called on 
the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton, to lift the economic 
sanctions against Vietnam and set up diplomatic relations with 
Vietnam. Senator Bennett Johnston, a Democrat from Louisiana 
who is chairman of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources 
Commission, said: 
  [Begin Johnston recording] It is very clear that the 
Vietnamese have been cooperative -- most of the way if not all 
the way -- and the way to reward cooperation is not by 
punishment. An embargo is punishment -- it is a sanction -- and 
the punishment ought to stop, and start a new chapter. [end 
recording] 
  Senator Johnston noted that as Vietnam has been very 
cooperative in the settlement of the MIA issue, the U.S. 
Administration should respond to this goodwill. The embargo 
should be lifted. He added that Washington should close the 
past and reconcile with Vietnam. It was in the interests of the 
families whose sons were reported missing during the war in 
Vietnam. He noted that there was no obstacle for President 
Clinton to lift the embargo. 
  For his part, Senator Mark Hatfield, a Republican from 
Oregon, noted that the lifting of the embargo and trading with 
Vietnam would promote a true sense of the settlement of the MIA 
issue, which is the most concerned issue of Americans. 
  On impressions of his visit to Vietnam, Senator Bennett 
Johnston said: 
  [Begin Johnston recording] There is tremendous vitality and 
energy in this country. That is the first thing you notice -- 
activity everywhere; entrepreneurship everywhere. It's the kind 
of thing you saw in China a few years ago, and of course China 
is now an economic miracle of Asia. I would expect that 
economic miracle to take place here. The second impression is 
the friendliness of the Vietnamese people toward us -- toward 
Americans; toward the United States. You can't hide that sort 
of thing and you can't fake it. And that came through very 
clear. [end recording]

  [Text] The Hanoi Labor, War Invalids, and Social Welfare 
Agency met on 7 January to evaluate its work performance for 
1993 and initiate its tasks for 1994. Attending the function 
were Comrade Pham The Duyet, member of the Political Bureau and 
secretary of the Hanoi party committee, and representatives of 
the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, and Social Welfare and 
other concerned sectors. 
  In 1993, the Hanoi Labor, War Invalids, and Social Welfare 
Agency patterned its action program after the city's political 
tasks and 10 fundamental orientations. Thanks to well-defined 
guidelines and positive steps, the agency gave advice to local 
party committee echelons and administrative organs on ways to 
ensure the positive implementation of labor, war invalid, and 
social welfare policies. Satisfactory steps have been taken to 
generate jobs. More than 20 billion dong has been drawn from 
different public funds to create jobs for 33,500 unemployed 
people. A total of 181 households with 345 working people have 
been sent to various new economic zones. 
  Due effort has been made to look after the well-being of war 
invalids and survivors of fallen combatants. Altogether, 91 
houses have been built and 4,265 savings accounts have been 
opened for distribution to families that rendered meritorious 
service to the revolution. Furthermore, 560 seriously ill 
soldiers and 60 parents with two or more children listed as 
fallen combatants have undergone treatment or been admitted to 
nursing homes. The agency has also made extra efforts to 
educate and provide vocational training to drug addicts and 
prostitutes. 
  In 1994, the agency will work out a program to eliminate 
hunger and reduce poverty. It is expected that by 1995, no 
family in the city will be affected by hunger.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA Jan. 8 -- In 1993 nearly 1.5 million of 
land tenure certificates were granted to farmer households in 47 
(out of 52) provinces and cities in Vietnam. 
  The area of land whose ownership was transferred from 
agricultural collectives to households or individuals accounted 
for only close to 14 per cent of the plan. 
  The transfer of land ownership (mainly land for agricultural 
production) was carried [out] in more than 1,330,000 communes in 
the 47 cities and provinces in accordance with the government's

<F P=106> [Resolution issued by Fourth Session of Ninth National </F>
Assembly] 
  [Text] In 1993 our economy continued to improve. All major 
economic targets were reached or overfulfilled. In an important 
step, the socioeconomic situation was put under control. 
Political stabilization was maintained. Our external relations 
were broadened. Vietnam's reputation in the world was 
heightened. The achievements recorded in 1993 and previous 
years created a momentum for the country to develop in the 
following years. 
  However, our economy still has many weaknesses. Many urgent 
cultural and social issues have not been solved in an efficient 
manner. The evil practices of waste, corruption, and smuggling 
is still prevalent. Order and discipline in economic and social 
management are still not firm enough. 
  Based on that situation and the new requirements, the 
National Assembly resolves that the main duties and targets for 
1994 will be as follows: 
  1. Orientations and Duties for 1994 and Following Years: We 
must strengthen all recorded achievements, carry out the first 
step of industrialization and modernization, and grasp 
opportunities to accelerate our economic development rate in 
order to move our country on to a new developing stage. At the 
same time, we must make important cultural and social changes, 
intensify the fight against corruption and smuggling, maintain 
political stabilization, broaden external relations, and protect 
our national independence, sovereignty, and integrity. 
  2. Main Targets in 1994: General domestic production will 
increase by eight percent. General industrial output and 
agricultural production will increase by 11 percent and four 
percent respectively. Food production will be 25 million tons. 
Exports will increase by 20 percent. The inflation rate must 
be below 10 percent. The rate of population growth must be 
lowered by 0.06 percent. 
  The National Assembly Resolution outlines the major duties 
and measures to be executed in 1994: 
  1. The Economy: 
  A. Agriculture, forestry, and aquaculture must be 
comprehensively developed together with the development of their 
respective processing industries. All production, business, and 
service activities must be accelerated in a diversified manner 
in cities and rural areas. 
  In 1994 we must carry out the granting of land as regulated 
by the law. External economic activities must be intensified, 
especially the export sector. We have to replace imported 
products with those that can be produced locally; we have to 
limit the import of nonessential goods, and efficiently protect 
local production. We must restore, upgrade, and construct our 
material and social infrastructure and selectively build some 
heavy industrial establishments in key sectors. 
  B. We must practice thrift in production and consumption to 
save money for development investment and improve the 
productivity, quality, and efficiency of our business and 
production. We have to increase our accumulated savings for 
future investment and promulgate, amend, or supplement 
mechanisms for efficient mobilization and use of capital 
resources. We must quickly and satisfactorily provide funds 
from the state budget for the implementation of approved 
planning and reform the infrastructure management to prevent 
negativism and waste. 
  We must fully exploit all our saving capacity for 
development 
investment in all economic sectors. In macro-management, we 
have to create favorable legal conditions to enable people to 
invest their money in business and eliminate administrative red 
tape and embarrassing actions which may discourage investors. 
  We must implement policies to strongly encourage foreign 
investment and set up mechanisms that clearly define 
responsibility regarding foreign loan applications and 
repayment, ensure good use of foreign loans, and avoid heavy 
debts for subsequent years. 
  We must immediately form economic courts according to the 
stipulations of the revised and amended Law on the Organization 
of People's Courts and issue relating legal documents -- 
especially legal documents dealing with the implementation of 
the Law on Business Bankruptcy and the Regulation on Court 
Procedures of Economic Cases -- to ensure the early operation of 
economic courts. 
  C. We must continue to reform the national financial policy 
and banking system and set up and develop a capital market and 
share holding companies, gradually introducing shares, credit 
notes, and bonds to create the requisite basis for the 
establishment of stock markets to meet the increasing demand for 
the movement of capital and use of the economy. We have to 
amend and supplement mechanisms and policies to ensure strict 
implementation of the guidelines on practicing thrift in 
government offices, army, public security forces, mass 
organizations, and business enterprises for more development 
investment. 
  D. We must continue to strengthen and build efficient 
state-run economic units in key areas and sectors so that they 
can shoulder their leading role in the national economy. We 
have to strengthen and improve the state trading sector and 
firmly control the import- export of necessary materials. We 
also have to firmly hold the wholesale service and maintain a 
necessary part in the retail service so that the state trading 
service can work together with other economic sectors to 
accelerate production development and protect the benefits of 
the producers and consumers. 
  We must fundamentally reform the organization and management 
mechanism of state-run economic enterprises and introduce a 
shareholding system for suitable businesses to attract more 
capital resources and create more of a driving force to prevent 
negativism and improve business operations. We will gradually 
apply firm steps to share business profits according to basic 
salaries and sell a percentage of shares with concessional 
conditions to officers and workers working directly at the state 
enterprises. We will sell shares and bonds of some state-run 
enterprises to other economic sectors and to the public on a 
experimental basis. We must perfect all contractual forms used 
in state enterprises. 
  On the basis of equitization, it is necessary to organize 
administrative councils and adopt other suitable organizational 
forms to effectively manage the production and business 
activities of enteprises. 
  We should undertake the setting up of large trading 
consortiums capable of competing in domestic and foreign 
markets; enhance the state management functions of integrated 
and specialized ministries and of the administration at various 
levels in order to ensure that the business of enterprises is 
autonomous; and advance toward gradually discarding the system 
of managing ministries and administrative echelons as well as 
the discrimination between the central and local enterprises. 
  E. We must provide assistance and guidance for the 
renovation of cooperative economies, develop the dynamic role of 
cooperative members, and renovate and develop various forms of 
economic cooperation in agriculture, forestry, and fishery. We 
must deal in a proper manner with those cooperatives still beset 
with sluggishness; promote various forms of economic cooperation 
in artisan and handicraft production, and in trade and services; 
formulate policies to provide assistance to private economic 
units so they can operate effectively; create more employment; 
and make contributions to national development. Meanwhile, we 
must promote the development of various forms of voluntary and 
mutually-beneficial cooperation in production and business. 
  The state must continue to encourage the private sector to 
make development investment in those branches and areas which 
are not restricted by the law, protect the ownership and legal 
interests of private businessmen, help and guide these 
businessmen in overcoming difficulties and in doing their 
business in accordance with the law, and have specific 
regulations and organizations capable of adequately performing 
various state management functions in connection with those 
business firms with direct foreign invested capital. 
  F. We must continue to renovate the economic management 
mechanism in order to create necessary conditions for the market 
system to operate effectively. We must increase state 
macro-management efforts in order to orient and direct the 
development of the entire national economy. We must develop 
positive aspects and avert and contain negative aspects; we must 
overcome the deficiencies of the market system if we are to make 
the marketplace truly become an important instrument in the 
regulation and effective use of various sources of supply. We 
must distribute and redistribute national income, ensure the 
relations between accumulation and spending, and regulate the 
interests of economic components between themselves and between 
various strata of people in order to meet the requirements for 
faster and steadier economic growth and better social justice. 
  2. Science and technology: 
  We must link scientific and technological activities with 
dirrect efforts to serve production and life. We must continue 
to deploy and apply the results of various key projects and 
acquire the scientific and technological advances of various 
countries in support of the renovation process in order to 
contribute to further improving the technological level and 
increasing labor output and product quality. We must deploy the 
law on environmental production and continue to renovate 
managerial work aimed at enhancing the efficiency of scientific 
and technological activities. We must build our potential in 
advanced science and technologies so as to serve 
industrialization and modernization in the new stage. 
  3. Culture and science: 
  We must attach importance to the human factor in all areas 
of 
social life. 
  A. We must increase our leadership activities and formulate 
annual plans for compulsory elementary education if we are to 
ensure the application of compulsory elementary education 
nationwide by the year 2000 and introduce compulsory high school 
education in areas where conditions permit. We must mobilize all 
available resources for the cause of education and training, 
care for the pedagogical sector, consolidate public high 
schools, encourage the opening of privately-built semi-public 
schools, rearrange the system of vocational colleges and middle 
schools, build high-quality training centers, turn out young 
talents, and draw up policies to create conditions for sending 
students and cadres for further study abroad. 
  We must gradually improve the quality of the contingent of 
school teachers by providing training and retraining for them. 
We must adopt an appropriate incentive policy for good teachers 
and those teachers in high-lying, inaccessible, or remote areas. 
Specific attention must be given to academic work in mountain 
areas and areas inhabitated by ethnic minority groups, 
especially to boarding schools for ethnic students. We must 
activiely train teachers of various ethnic groups and ensure 
adequate and timely allocation of educational and cultural funds 
for the grassroots. 
  B. We must maintain and develop our national cultural 
identity; build a civilized lifestyle and cultural families; 
care for the contingent of people involved in cultural and 
artistic creation; and step up cultural, artistic, information, 
physical education, and sports activities, particularly at the 
grassroots, in order to gradually improve the level of cultural 
enjoyment of the people. 
  We must rectify our management of publishing activities and 
the import and export of cultural works, and effectively fight 
against noxious culture, unhealthy lifestyles, and 
superstitions. We must promote the practice of thrift in 
organizing festivals, funerals and weddings. We must preserve 
the heritage of our folk culture, restore historical and 
revolutionary relics, and prevent illegal occupation of these 
relics and other acts of vandalism. 
  C. We must resolutely avert and dispel all social ills such 
as drug addiction -- through smoking or intravenous injection 
--, gambling, and prostitution, particularly in major urban 
areas and cities. We must take stern punitive measures as 
defined by law against offenders. Meanwhile, we must actively 
combine correctional education with vocational training and 
productive labor and must adopt preventive and control measures 
against HIV infection. We must reserve necessary funds for the 
resolution of these social ills. 
  D. We must pay appropriate attention to and care for 
people's primary health, especially for mothers and children in 
rural and mountain regions; we must accelerate the immunization 
campaigns against epidemic diseases and endeavor to curb the 
rate of malnutrition among children. We must also strengthen 
the tasks relating to population and family planning, as well as 
solidify and develop tbe network of local medical stations, 
especially in mountainous, remote, and not readily-accessible 
regions. We must be active in training locals to become medical 
cadres and speed up the promulgation of regulations that treat 
grassroot medical cadres adequately. An adequate budget for the 
treatment of malaria and leprosy must be guaranteed, and iodine 
salt for the grassroot level to treat goiter must be provided. 
Concerned provinces will be authorized to distribute free of 
charge iodine salt to poor people living in highland regions. 
Free medical consultation and treatment for poor people must be 
guaranteed, and the hospital management task must be 
strengthened so as to counter the degradation of hospitals. We 
must speed up the establishment of two advanced medical centers 
in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and try to develop the 
traditional ethic of the medical profession, that likens a good 
doctor to a tender mother. 
  E. We will form effective policies and measures to create 
more jobs for people of working age, especially for young people 
who have been trained, and for discharged soldiers. We will 
also motivate capital from various sources to develop 
production, business, and service activities in both urban and 
rural areas in order to attract and exploit labor. We must also 
continue the effective implementation of the program to 
eliminate hunger and reduce poverty, with special attention paid 
to regions suffering the most from natural disasters, highland 
and remote regions, or former resistance bases. The 
entitlements and living standards of those eligible for social 
security assistance must be guaranteed and improved. We must 
speed up the promulgation of a decree that stipulates rewards 
for people with meritorious deeds and implement effectively the 
new wage policy, correcting any unfair consequences in the 
process. 
  4. Regarding National Defense and Security: 
  We must motivate all the people and all the army in building 
an ever steadfast national defense mechanism and security for 
the people. Every contribution must be mobilized to create a 
favorable environment for socioeconomic development. All 
sectors and levels, all people and armed forces nationwide 
should be in a permanent state of high vigilance against the 
peace evolution plot. We must set up and carry out plans to 
safeguard our sovereignty and security on all national terrains, 
especially on the major localities; we must build up strong 
local defense regions in all levels of provinces, cities, 
districts, and other areas; and coordinate socioeconomic plans 
harmoniously with national defense and security ones, and vice 
versa. We must also create coordination between the armed 
forces and the mass movements in order to increase the 
protection of social order and safety as well as national 
defense bases, especially major localities. We must endeavor 
to improve the quality of the steadfast armed forces, which are 
upstanding, having excellent combat ability, good 
professionalism, formality, and discipline. We must also be 
active in production, exercising frugality, and participating in 
the fight against corruption, smuggling, and other social ills. 
We must strive to enhance the quality of selection criterion 
for youths joining the army; pay attention to building up the 
reserve force; guarantee the supply of military equipment; 
invest appropriately in the development of military production 
and business industries in 1994 and the coming years; bring 
about concrete progress in improving living standards in both 
the material and cultural life of the armed forces; and 
successfully mobilize support for the army from the people. 
  5. Regarding External Affairs: 
  Developing our past achievements, we must continue our 
independent, self-reliant, diversified, and multidirectional 
foreign policy; and we must expand friendly and cooperative 
relations in all aspects with our neigboring countries, 
Southeast Asian countries, Pacific Asian countries, and other 
countries as well as the international organizations. We must 
strive to create an ever more favorable international 
environment for our process of building and safeguarding our 
fatherland. 
  The National Assembly resolution reserves its last part for 
discussion of the improvement of leadership and management 
tasks, and heightening the effectiveness of the supervision, 
control and judiciary tasks. It stresses that we must exercise 
harmoniously all legal tools and all financial and monetary 
programs in order to effectively enhance the efficiency of 
macro-management in the economy, and to clearly determine the 
responsibilities and rights of administrative authorities at all 
levels, so as to ensure the centralization of the government on 
the one hand, and to develop the innovative role of localites on 
the other. We must also strive to overcome the decentralized 
and factional situation; speed up administrative reform; set up 
administrative law and administrative judiciary agencies; 
strengthen the tasks of inspection, control, and auditing; 
solidify law enforcement agencies; reorganize the state 
mechanism aiming at making it light and effective; reaffirm the 
role of managing ministries and separate the state management 
role from the business one; retrain the cadre contingent; and 
speed up the establishment of the public service award and the 
system of public liability of employees working in the state 
mechanism. We must also strive to enhance the efficiency of the 
supervisory role of the National Assembly, the National Assembly 
Standing Committee, the Nationalities Council and other 
committees, and the National Assembly deputies and delegations; 
we must strongly develop the efficiency of the judicial 
activities of the people's courts, and of the control activities 
of the people's organ of control on the tasks and measures 
approved by the National Assembly. 
  The National Assembly cordially urges all people, combatants 
countrywide, as well as fellow countrymen living overseas, to 
develop our solidarity tradition, heighten the spirit of 
self-reliance, and endeavor with our utmost effort to seize the 
opportunities and develop every potential of the country to 
successfully fulfill all the tasks of 1994, with the aim of 
building up a wealthy people, a strong country, and a fair and 
civilized society.

<F P=106> ["False Reports of U.S. and South Korean Media About 'Food </F>
Shortage' Refuted" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
DPRK State Agricultural Commission answered a question put by 
KCNA today concerning the rumor of "food shortage" in North 
Korea spread by some U.S. and South Korean media recently. 
  He said: 
  Some time ago, the Voice of America and the U.S. paper WALL 
STREET JOURNAL set afloat false reports that North Korea was 
suffering "a serious food shortage" and it was in "an extreme 
food crisis". 
  Meanwhile, South Korean press went so far as to spread the 
unfounded rumor that North Korea asked some one to supply rice 
and would send a delegation to a certain country to request an 
emergency food aid. 
  The fuss made by some U.S. and South Korean media about our 
"food shortage" is nothing but a dastardly farce invented with a 
view to tarnishing the image of the socialism of our style and 
covering up the reality of South Korea where agriculture now 
faces a catastrophic crisis due to the anti-popular agricultural 
policy. 
  Last year, the agricultural sector of our country not only 
completed irrigation and electrification on a high level and 
made an advance in mechanization and application of chemicals 
but reaped an unusual bumper harvest by doing farming on a 
scientific and technological basis as required by the chuche 
method of farming. 
  We, regarding food as a main strategic supply, have long 
since stored much extra rice. This was proved by the fact that 
when South Korea suffered flood damages, we, out of compatriotic 
feeling, sent to South Korea rice which had been in storage for 
more than four or five years. This was admitted by the South 
Korean authorities. 
  Nevertheless, U.S. and South Korean media are vociferating 
about the "food problem" of the North. This is aimed at 
slandering our socialist system and lulling the South Korean 
people's anti-U.S., anti-"government" sentiments which have 
mounted with a crop failure and rice market opening. 
  Solid foundations for agricultural production have been laid 
in our country in accordance with the theses on the socialist 
rural question. This always guarantees bumper crops. 
  If the U.S. and South Korean media want something to report 
about food crisis, they had better find it in the South Korean 
countryside suffering from bad harvest every year and crying 
over rice market opening. Only then, they will save their face 
as mass media.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 9 (KCNA) -- Some 800 students 
under the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils 
held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul 
Saturday [8 January] in protest against the opening of the rice 
market. 
  They occupied the road in front of the embassy and denounced 
the United States for forcing agro-market opening and Kim 
Yong-sam the puppet for his treacherous compliance, shouting 
"oppose America forcing market opening" and "oppose Kim 
Yong-sam's sycophant diplomacy". 
  Upset by the protests of the students, the fascist clique 
mobilized police to disperse the protesters by force.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- National Chairman of 
the Communist Party of the USA Gus Hall in an article published 
in the party's organ PEOPLE'S WEEKLY WORLD urged all the 
Americans to protest Clinton's policy threatening North Korea 
with a nuclear preemptive strike. 
  In an article calling for a nuclear-free world he pointed 
out 
that the current threat to world peace comes from the US policy 
of nuclear aggression against North Korea. 
  He noted that the United States is stepping up preparations 
for a nuclear preemptive strike at North Korea. 
  Direct nuclear threat to North Korea is part of the anti- 
communist and anti-socialist policy pursued continuously by the 
United States, he said, and added: It is the same policy as the 
nuclear business in the old cold-war era. 
  Facts show that Clinton is more bellicose than his 
predecessors, he stated. 
  He branded the U.S. imperialists as the very one actually 
threatening world peace. 
  He called upon the anti-war, anti-imperialist forces to 
rebuild America's peace movement to conduct activities with a 
demand for a stop to the threat to North Korea and demand for 
the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea.

  [Text] Comrade Li Peng, premier of the PRC State Council, 
on 8 January held talks with the Japanese foreign minister and 
stressed the need to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula through dialogue, according to XINHUA news agency. 
  Referring to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, he 
pointed out: China supports the stance of realizing the 
denuclearization on the Korean peninsula and maintaining 
security and peace on the peninsula. We hope that the nuclear 
issue will be resolved reasonably through dialogue. We do not 
approve of using means of imposing pressure or sanctions since 
such ways can bring an adverse effect and produce discrepancy on 
the issue.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Yi Yong-tok, the new 
minister of the South Korean puppet Unification Board, at a 
press conference on January 5 reportedly uttered very 
provocative words that he "will not respond unconditionally even 
if the North proposes a North-South dialogue." 
  He meant that the South Korean puppet clique would refuse 
dialogue with the North by setting every conceivable condition. 
This clearly proved once again that they actually do not want 
any contact and dialogue between the North and the South but 
continue seeking confrontation and division, although they are 
loud-mouthed about dialogue and the exchange of special envoys. 
  The mishmash of Yi Yong-tok is grave because it came at a 
time when a breakthrough has been made in the solution of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S. 
contacts and work is being done for a progress of the DPRK- 
U.S. talks. Yi's words are a base blast to foil the DPRK-U.S. 
talks at any cost and isolate and stifle the North by setting an 
"international cooperation system" in-motion. 
  Judging from this, "preconditions" for DPRK-U.S. talks cried 
for by the South Korean puppets are, in the final analysis, a 
brake on the DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Still more intolerable is that he, ridiculously enough, spun 
out the venomous trash that "the North's human rights problem 
will be dealt with" and "things touching the North on the raw 
will be mentioned in the future". 
  It is preposterous for Yi Yong-tok to have cried over the 
North's "human rights problem", while keeping mum about the 
reality of South Korea riddled with human rights abuses.

<F P=106> ["Sugar-Coated Words of Hypocrite" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim 
Yong-sam, a puppet, called a "New Year's press conference" 
Thursday outlining "the orientation of the administration of the 
state affairs" this year, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  The tirade spun out by the traitor at the "press conference" 
was, in a nutshell, a base rigmarole full of disgusting honeyed 
words to justify his towering crimes in seeking flunkeyism and 
treachery, fascism and violence, division and confrontation last 
year under the "civilian" veil, prop up the puppet regime facing 
a crisis of destruction caused by the already bankrupt "policy 
of reforms" and break the fighting spirit of the people who had 
risen up resolutely to overthrow the "civilian government", 
disillusioned with it. 
  Viciously taking issue with the fictitious "nuclear problem" 
of the North again, he wagged his tongue freely, blaring that he 
would make his "maximum effort for the settlement of the nuclear 
issue of the North". 
  Recent contacts between the DPRK and the U.S. opened up a 
prospect for the solution to the "nuclear problem" of the Korean 
peninsula and paved the way for a progress of the talks between 
the two sides. Quite upset by this, the South Korean puppets 
are raising such terrific outcries over the "nuclear issue" of 
the North in a bid to set the "international cooperation system" 
in-motion at any cost. 
  The bellicose blast of the traitor Kim Yong-sam about the 
"modernisation" of the puppet Army and "establishment of a 
security posture" shows that the puppets are virtually seeking a 
showdown of strength. 
  It is an unpardonable anti-national criminal act for the 
South Korean puppets to take the road of inciting North-South 
confrontation and aggravating the tension in the Korean 
peninsula, in league with outside forces, turning down the offer 
of fellow countrymen to open a way out for the nation through 
the reconciliation and unity of North and South.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Papers here today say 
the traitor Kim Yong-sam's "New Year press conference" proved 
again that the South Korean "civilian" regime is only a disguise 
and it is not different from the successive military fascist 
regimes and that there is nothing to be expected from it. 
  A NODONG SINMUN analyst says: 
  What he said at the press conference boils down to the 
praise 
of his "achievements" whereby he embellished his treacheries as 
patriotism with flowery words, the advertisement of "policy" 
without any concrete proposal and deceptive, infeasible 
"commitments." His self-praise was intended to defend his 
monstrous crimes against the country and the nation in the first 
year of office and avoid his responsibility for them. 
  Kim Yong-sam got on the nerve of the North, groundlessly 
charging it with the "nuclear problem." He cried for "military 
reform and modernization" and "security posture" to cope with 
possible "provocations" by the North. He obtrusively blared 
that they have the "final say" as regards the "Team Spirit" 
joint military exercises and the United States "respects" their 
will. 
  This year, too, he, far from showing his willingness for 
reunification, intends to seek North-South confrontation as he 
did in the first year of office marked by treacheries. He is 
really a traitor to the nation and a human dreg who deserves 
condemnation by the 70 million people of our nation. 
  Regarding the internal problems of South Korea, Kim Yong-sam 
cried for "continued progress of change and reform" and 
"internationalization of the whole society," as if he would do 
something in the second year of office. He, however, failed to 
put forward any concrete proposal. 
  His voluble eloquence at the hurriedly called press 
conference in the new year is the extension of the old game of 
the political prostitute to attain the "security of power" by 
quelling the protest of the people against such treacherous acts 
of the "civilian" regime as rice market opening and taking the 
edge off their anti- "government" struggle. 
  A MINJU CHOSON analyst says that whatever honeyed 
"commitments" the "civilian" traitor may make, while enriching 
outside forces and the privileged circles at the sacrifice of 
the people, no one will be deceived.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Human Rights Infringer's </F>
Ballad on the Respect of Human Life"] 
  [Text] The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam held a so-called 
report meeting on life reforms on 7 January. Talking about life 
reforms, he raved that the spirit of respecting human life 
should be put into practice and that many people must not be 
made lawbreakers because of unrealistic legal systems. The 
rascal raved that the people should actually feel the success of 
life reforms within a year at the most. This is another 
brazen-faced mockery of the people, which can be raved by 
traitor Kim Yong-sam, that is, the political impostor well 
versed in fraud, trickery, cheating, and machination. 
  To renovate the spirit of respect for human life in South 
Korea, the colonial fascist rule should, above all, be put to an 
end. Fascist vicious laws, including the National Security Law, 
which systematically infringes upon the people's freedom and 
rights; and suppressive organizations, such as the police, 
prosecution, and the Agency for National Security Planning 
[NSP], and the Defense Security Command should be abrogated and 
dissolved. Then new laws and organizations centered on the 
people should come into being. Otherwise, the spirit of 
respecting human life cannot be displayed. 
  In fact, even today, that is, the era of respecting human 
life, human dignity, and freedom have been fully trampled 
underfoot in South Korea. It is in South Korea where youths, 
students, and patriotic figures who struggled for independence, 
democracy, and reunification, have been secretly assassinated 
and dumped into rivers and seas. It is also in the rotten South 
Korea where husbands kill wives and vice versa, sons and 
daughters kill parents and secretly bury them, and traffickers 
in human flesh for a little money prevail. The worst human 
right infringement activity has been committed by the Kim 
Yong-sam ring babbling about respecting human rights. 
  Under the pretext of a civilian regime, the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet ring is suppressing the people more mercilessly than at 
the time of the military dictatorial regimes. By mobilizing the 
police, the puppet ring trampled underfoot the workers who 
staged sit-ins calling for the right for subsistence last year. 
It mercilessly suppressed youths, students, and citizens 
calling for revealing the truth behind the Kwangju incident and 
punishing those responsible for the Kwangju incident, by 
mobilizing approximately 100,000 policemen. The number of 
people who were injured by the police is more than three times 
those injured at the time of the Sixth Republic. This shows 
that the Kim Yong-sam puppet ring is mercilessly suppressing the 
people. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam raved that many fellow countrymen must 
not be made lawbreakers because of an unrealistic legal system. 
This is also a brazen-faced maneuver. Many kinds of vicious 
laws, which can be applicable under any circumstances, exist in 
South Korea. The National Security Law is the most vicious law 
of all laws. 
  It goes without saying that the National Security Law is an 
unrealistic one in view of the background of the enacted law and 
its reactionary characteristics. For this reason, the South 
Korean people have strongly demanded that the National Security 
Law--the vicious fascist law against democracy and 
reunification--be rescinded. 
  However, the Kim Yong-sam ring has aggravated North-South 
relations and arrested and persecuted many people by brandishing 
this law. This nonetheless, he had the face of raving that many 
fellow countrymen must not be made lawbreakers because of an 
unrealistic legal system. How brazen-faced the rascal is! 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam babbled about the spirit of respecting 
human life from the beginning of the new year. The reason he 
spat out such words is clear. As everyone knows, since traitor 
Kim Yong-sam seized power under the pretext of a civilian-regime 
president, he has babbled about the improvement of human rights 
and the development of democracy. Even though one year has 
passed since he seized power, nothing has changed in South 
Korea. Vicious fascist laws, including the National Security 
Law, which is a legal and systematic device for infringing upon 
human rights, have existed as they are or have been turned for 
the worse. The NSP, the hotbed of human right infringement, has 
remained intact. 
  In addition, the rulers' infringements of human rights are 
more prevalent than those of the time of the Fifth and Sixth 
Republics. Thus, people cannot breathe to their heart's content. 
  The so-called civilian regime's color was clearly brought to 
light. The people, who have been deceived by the rascals' 
ballad of reform, are trying to rise up to struggle against the 
rulers. Taken by surprise, traitor Kim Yong-sam is trying once 
again to deceive the people and maintain power by means of the 
ballad on human rights. It is unreasonable to babble about the 
respect of human life in South Korea--a land barren of democracy 
and a living hell-- where human rights have been fully trampled 
underfoot. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet ring should abrogate and dissolve 
the 
vicious fascist laws, including the National Security Law, and 
the other suppression organizations, including the NSP; should 
stop suppressing the people; and should immediately release all 
patriotic figures who have been illegally arrested.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "The Civilian Fascism is </F>
Further Intensifying"] 
  [Text] The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique revealed its 
criminal attempt to further intensify the suppression of the 
labor movement in the beginning of the new year. 
  According to reports, the puppet Labor Ministry set labor- 
management stability as the prime goal for this year's labor 
policy and growled that it would take stern legal measures on 
illegal labor disputes, and invoke the right for emergency 
mediation on strikes in key industries even if they are legal. 
  It also said that it would use the full extent of the law in 
force concerning the ban on the intervention of a third party to 
prevent the intervention of outside forces. This shows that the 
fascist clique's suppression maneuvers to the workers' just 
demand and struggle will be further intensified. It is not a 
coincidence that South Korea's main radio station reported that 
government measures on labor-management dispute were expected to 
become harder. 
  As in any society, those who create material wealth are 
workers, and therefore, those who enjoy the wealth should also 
be the workers. However, South Korean workers are driven to 
long hours of hard labor in adverse conditions where there is no 
basic protection facilities for workers. They are only targets 
for exploitation and suppression. It is inevitable for them to 
struggle for their right for existence and democracy. 
  Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique brands their 
just struggle illegal and intends to brutally suppress them. 
The one who pretended to support the workers' struggle during 
his days with the opposition party, is betraying the workers and 
suppressing them now that the sword is in his hands. Traitor 
Kim Yong-sam, who said in the commitment of his election 
campaign that he would make a society where workers are honored, 
once advertised as if he would do something for workers putting 
out the signboards of civilian government after he seized power. 
However, his nature is not the one that can side with working 
people. 
  Suppression of people is a way to survive for the puppet 
clique. That the puppet clique intensified suppression of the 
people in the very beginning of the new year by throwing away 
the nominal labor- management data which it once showed around, 
and invoking the emergency mediation right that even the 
preceding military dictator regimes, which were notorious for 
suppression, could not have dared to attempt to use, proves that 
it has undisguisedly drawn the sword of suppression completely 
casting off its civilian skin. 
  Could there be any fascist more brutal than this? The Kim 
Yong- sam traitor clique is a rare fascist tyrant more brutal 
than its predecessors. 
  The reason that Kim Yong-sam's clique ran amuck to brutal 
suppression in the beginning of the new year is not elsewhere. 
As it has been exposed, during his junket to the United States 
in November last year, traitor Kim Yong-sam promised to open the 
South Korean rice market to his master backing down on his 
commitment that he would keep the rice market with his 
presidential post. Subsequently, he formally accepted the demand 
to open the rice market in the Uruguay Round negotiations. 
  It is not simply to ruin the South Korean agriculture and 
drive the six million farmers to death. As described by the 
South Korean publications that the Uruguay Round storm was 
coming, South Korea has no choice but to open not only the 
agricultural products market but also the South Korean economy's 
overall market including clothes and industrial products. 
  Therefore, this year in South Korea, it is inevitable for 
not 
only farmers but also many people from all walks of life to come 
out to an antigovernment struggle against Kim Yong-sam clique's 
treachery and traitorous acts. 
  Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's uncovering of its suppression 
attempt from the beginning of this year is a precaution for fear 
of the people's struggle that is expected to explode like a 
volcano in the future. 
  However, it is merely the last rave of those who have no 
future. The more brutal the suppression, the stronger will be 
the people's struggle against it. South Korean people will 
never cease before the end of the struggle against the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique that sold out the dignity and interest of 
the nation and country to a foreign force for its own comfort 
and good and ran amok to fascist suppression. 
  The day the people's fascist will stand on his trial by the 
people and be thrown to history's night soil bin is not far away.

their operations. 
  Former puppet Army soldiers who had been taken to the war

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- South Korean 
opposition parties denounced the puppet Army-prosecution joint 
investigation headquarters which concluded an arms import 
scandal as a "mere fraud", according to a radio report from 
Seoul. 
  6.7 million dollars disappeared in 1992 and some 1,300 
million South Korean won in 1991 when the puppet Defence 
Ministry was dealing with a French company over the import of 
ammunitions. 
  The (?seamy) side of the case was disclosed in December last 
year. The puppet Army-prosecution joint investigation 
headquarters clinched off the case as a "mere fraud" committed 
by a South Korean arms broker and a French arms dealer vis-a-vis 
the logistics headquarters of the puppet Defence Ministry. 
  The Democratic Party in a commentary January 7 branded the 
joint investigation headquarters' behavior as ridiculous, and 
urged the invocation of the "parliamentary investigation power" 
in order to probe the truth of the case. 
  The national party in a statement demanded that the 
"government" nullify the results of investigation of the 
headquarters and appoint a special prosecutor to make a full 
reinvestigation into the case.

firmly united under the banner of great unity of the whole 
nation, regardless of differences in ideology, idea and system. 
  Chu Song-il said that if the South Korean authorities really 
want to pursue civilian politics, they must begin with the 
abolition of the anti-democracy, anti-reunification fascist laws 
and repressive tools and with reforms of the system for 
democracy and institutional reforms for reunification and ensure 
free activities of people of all strata calling for national 
reunification. 
  Choe Yong-hae held that the nuclear problem of the Korean 
peninsula must be peacefully resolved by means of negotiation, 
that is through DPRK-U.S. talks in any case. "The imperialists 
and reactionaries must act with discretion, looking straight at 
the indomitable will of the young people of Korea to defend 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander with their lives, 
becoming 5 million shells and bombs, and defend the sovereignty 
of the country and the gains of revolution with their blood," he 
warned. 
  Choe Song-suk said: 
  "Our agricultural working people can never pardon the 
criminal act of the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique in opening the 
rice market, even wringing the necks of the South Korean 
farmers, driven by the foolish intention to do harm to fellow 
countrymen."

  [Text] The following are the Declaration on the Current 
Situation and the Immediate Fighting Slogans, which are 
documents of the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF] 
Central Committee, which were approved by the expanded meeting 
of the Standing Committee of the SKNDF Central Committee held in 
Seoul on 2 January. 
  The Declaration on the Current Situation approved by the 
expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the SKNDF Central 
Committee follows: 
  The political situation of the new year demands that we wage 
a definitive struggle [chong kyolsan] against the Kim Yong-sam 
civilian regime. The Kim Yong-sam regime, which was launched by 
publicizing its civilian status in the womb of the Sixth 
Republic, loudly beat the drum of change and reform during its 
10 months of power. The result is only the sediment of military 
dictatorship and the regime has done nothing for the people. 
  Our people cried out calling for genuine democratization, 
but 
the Kim Yong-sam ring blocked the road to genuine 
democratization by false democratic reform and built a civilian 
fascist dictatorship more vicious and crafty than the military 
fascist dictatorship. His political reform resulted in the 
revival of the notorious National Security Law and the Agency 
for National Security Planning and the lengthening of the billy 
club used for the repression of demonstrations from 71 
centimeters to 105 centimeters. Business conglomerates were 
given special favors for investment and the working masses were 
forced to face a new nightmare of sharing pain in his political 
reform. At the same time, the drama of state fraud and four 
unconstitutional cases, used to judge social reform, were sealed 
off unrectified and the main culprits have begun to reappear. 
  Our people have waged a bloody struggle for independence, 
but 
the Kim Yong-sam ring, in an attempt to shore up its fragile 
power, sold our people's national sovereignty and interests to 
outside forces. There has been no ruler in South Korea who did 
not engage in treachery, but no ruler has ever dared to sell out 
the rice market -- the people's flesh and blood. The Kim 
Yong-sam gang began to bargain over the opening of the rice 
market as early as when he contended for power as a presidential 
candidate, and sold it out completely as a card to check the 
North-proposed package solution to the nuclear problem. 
  There has been no ruler in South Korea who did not serve as 
a 
stooge for the United States, but there has never been a stooge 
like Kim Yong-sam, who asked the U.S. forces in South Korea to 
remain continuously and left all human and material resources in 
U.S. hands as strategic supplies in return for his role as a 
shock brigade to implement the U.S. concept of a new Pacific 
community. 
  As the five bandits of Ulsa in 1905 sold out the country to 
the Japanese imperialists and as traitors Pak Chong-hui and Kim 
Chong- pil signed the treacherous South Korea-Japan agreement in 
exchange for the property claim of $300 million, the Kim 
Yong-sam gang today is opening wide the door for reinvasion of 
the Japanese reactionaries, who are attempting to ignore the 
claim for the liquidation of the past wrongs they committed 
during the Japanese imperialist colonial rule and for the wrongs 
they committed against the Korean women forced to prostitute for 
the Japanese Army, and who are attempting to come to the fore as 
a military power and a nuclear power. 
  All the fellow countrymen have been ardently wishing to 
realize reunification in the nineties, but the traitorous Kim 
Yong-sam clique is leading North-South relations to a state of 
extreme confrontation under the pretext of the nuclear issue, 
thus driving the nation toward the calamity of nuclear war. 
Because of the Kim Yong-sam clique's treacherous act, the door 
for dialogue and exchange, which was open even under the Sixth 
Republic's military dictatorship, is completely closed under the 
civilian regime, the North-South agreement is nothing but mere 
paper, North-South relations are totally frozen, and dark clouds 
of a nuclear war are looming over the nation. 
  As traitor Syngman Rhee started the Korean war with the U.S. 
imperialists' backing yesterday, so traitor Kim Yong-sam is 
instigating a nuclear war with the backing of nuclear powers 
today. The Kim Yong-sam ring, seeking stability in its ruling 
system, is blocking and obliterating our masses' movement of 
change for independence, democracy, and reunification. The Kim 
Yong-sam regime even enforces the right of emergency 
coordination [kingup chojongkwon] and the right of forced 
dispersion [kangje haesankwon] with its new public 
security-dominated rule far worse than the Sixth Republic's 
public security-dominated rule in order to turn the movement of 
various strata into ruins. At the same time, it is employing 
all sorts of tactics to discolor the change-aspiring mass 
movement into a citizen's reformist movement. 
  Because of the birth of the Kim Yong-sam government, South 
Korea is not heading for independence, democracy, and 
reunification, but for a hell of fascism, subjugation, and 
nuclear disaster under an illusion of a civilian government. It 
is our people's general view that the traitorous Kim Yong-sam 
government must not be forgiven any more. 
  Along with all people who aspire for independence, 
democracy, 
and reunification, the SKNDF announces its resolute separation 
from the Kim Yong-sam government and solemnly declares that it 
will overthrow it. 
  1. We must overthrow the fake civilian government and 
establish a real, independent, and democratic government. The 
Kim Yong-sam government is the traitorous group that is 
poisoning democracy and is bringing a fire of nuclear war to the 
country with outside forces after creeping into Chongwadae 
[presidential office] under the cloak of a civilian government. 
  Our people cannot introduce the cause for independence, 
democracy, and reunification -- which is written in blood -- 
into the illusion of the civilian government. All strata of the 
patriotic masses, who want to live for independence and 
democracy, must bravely struggle to overthrow the fake civilian 
government, which is fascist-oriented, and to establish a real, 
independent, and democratic government. 
  2. We must earnestly carry out the movement for 
independence, democracy, and reunification. Kim Yong-sam 
government's reform is fake and is aimed at maintaining the 
stabilization of a ruling system. The real reform lies in 
achieving independence, democracy, and reunification. Earnestly 
accelerating the movement for independence, democracy, and 
reunification in a proper manner is a solemn order of the times 
and a historic mission. 
  The masses from all walks of life must make the 
popular-oriented struggle, which started as a result of the 
struggle against the rice market opening, become the movement 
for independence, democracy, and reunification. 
  Reality is not a situation for compromise, but rather a 
situation for struggle. All change movement organizations must 
not be involved in a dirty reformist trend, but instead they 
must make the masses become conscious through struggle; organize 
them through struggle; and create a vitality for the new leap of 
the reform movement. 
  Let us more clearly uphold the chuche banner of reform by 
driving out the wind of reformism. The anti-U.S. struggle is a 
basis of the national and democratic movement. Without the 
anti-U.S. struggle, we cannot expect independence, 
democratization, national peace, and reunification. Let us 
terminate the colonial fascist rule by waging a nationwide 
anti-U.S. struggle to expel [chubang] the United States and 
establish national sovereignty. 
  3. We must make all patriotic democratic forces unite as 
one. Chongwadae is now plotting to disperse our patriotic 
democratic forces from within and to obliterate them by 
isolating them from the masses. The present situation requires 
the patriotic democratic forces to unite unconditionally as one. 
Let us unite over and over again. The change movement of our 
masses -- which has inherited the vigor spirit of our nation by 
experiencing the 19 April uprising, the May Kwangju popular 
uprising, and the June democratic uprising -- will adhere to the 
chuche banner of change to the end and move forward until the 
day we remove colonial rule, the fascist dictatorship, and the 
national division from this land and when we achieve 
independence, democracy, and reunification. Destruction will 
be brought to the traitorous persons who aspire subjugation, 
fascism, and separation. The victory is our masses, who fight 
for independence, democracy, and reunification. 
  Hurrah for independence, democracy, and reunification! 
  The following are the Immediate Fighting Slogans, adopted 
at the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the SKNDF 
Central Committee. 
  Overthrowing the Kim Yong-sam traitorous regime and opening 
a 
road toward independence, democracy, and reunification today is 
the will of the popular masses and the call of national history. 
  At the call of the situation and the will of the popular 
masses, the SKNDF Central Committee releases the Immediate 
Fighting Slogans. 
  Let us overthrow the Kim Yong-sam treacherous fascist regime 
and establish a genuine independent and democratic regime! 
  Let us overthrow the Kim Yong-sam dictatorial regime, which 
is strangling democracy under the cloak of the civilian regime! 
  Let us abolish the National Security Law and all other 
vicious antidemocratic laws and dissolve dictatorial government 
agencies. Abolish the Agency for National Security Planning, the 
den of antipopular conspiracies and slandering! Let us destroy 
the Democratic Liberal Party, the den of civilian fascism and 
conspiracies! 
  Let us not be deceived by false democratic reforms but 
achieve democracy through struggle! Let us abolish the civilian 
fascist regime, which enforces the grass roots to share the 
pains! Let us abolish the vicious labor laws through struggle

agriculture and turned this land into a market for U.S. rice! 
Let us rake up civilian irregularities and end corrupt politics! 
  Let us execute Kim Yong-sam, who hushed up the [words 
indistinct] incidents and spared the criminals! 
  The civilian regime's toadyist and treacherous policies 
deepen dependence on the United States and Japan. Let us 
execute Kim Yong- sam, a pro-U.S., pro-Japan toadyist traitor! 
  Let us reject outside force and achieve national 
independence! There is no democracy or reunification without 
anti-Americanism. Let us more highly hold the torch of anti-U.S. 
struggle! 
  Let us remove the U.S. imperialists' colonial rule and 
achieve national independence! Let us drive out the United 
States, which instigates civilian fascism! 
  Let us bring an end to U.S. internal intervention through 
pan- national struggle and crush the pressure to open our 
markets! Let us keep U.S. rice off our market through anti-U.S. 
struggle! 
  Completely stop conducting the Team Spirit joint exercise, 
which brings in the dark clouds of nuclear war! There can exist 
the South only when there is the North. Let us crush the United 
States' slanderous maneuvers concerning suspicions about the 
North's nuclear development and defend the nation! 
  Remove U.S. forces and nuclear weapons from South Korea! Let 
us turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free zone through 
powerful anti-U.S. and antinuclear struggle! 
  Let us crush South Korea-Japan political alliance and 
prevent 
subordination to Japan! Let us nullify the South Korea-Japan 
agreement [on normalizing relations] and liquidate the past 
crimes of the Japanese imperialists! Let us awaken ourselves to 
Japan's attempt to become a military power and maneuvers to arm 
itself with nuclear weapons! 
  Let us bring an end to North-South confrontation and achieve 
the fatherland's independent, peaceful reunification! Let us 
deal a hard blow to the Kim Yong-sam divisionist regime, which 
has driven North-South relations to extreme confrontation! A 
nuclear war will break out if Kim Yong-sam is left alive! Let 
us behead [mogulchija] the Kim Yong-sam ring, the nuclear war 
servant of the United States! 
  Let us oust the Kim Yong-sam traitorous regime, which is 
frantically trying to crush [apsal] its fellow countrymen by 
pursuing an international cooperation system! Let us resolutely 
oppose all war exercises for northward aggression against our 
fellow countrymen! 
  Let us crush the divisionist maneuvers and achieve 
reunification under a confederal system! Let us accelerate the 
march toward reunification, in which the 70 million people will 
become one, under the banner of the 10-point program of great 
unity of the entire nation! 
  Let us develop the popular movement for independence, 
democracy, and reunification! Let us maintain the 
chuche-oriented reform ideology and highly hold the banner of 
independence, peace, and reunification! 
  Let us crush the maneuvers by the civilian fascist 
dictatorial regime to reform the movement circles and achieve a 
breakthrough in the movement for national salvation! 
  Let us reject the treacherous call for labor-management 
cooperation and industrial peace through struggle and activate 
the labor movement! 
  [Words indistinct] One million students! Lead the way in 
inciting 40 million people as demanded by the political 
situation! 
  Making reforms and criticizing while participating in the 
establishment leads one to self-destruction. Let us remove the 
dirty trend of reformation in a chuche-oriented way. Workers, 
peasants, and the youth and students! Highly raise the flames 
of the popular movement, realizing that they are masters among 
the three major groups [as heard]! 
  Let us expand the solidarity and joint struggles of people 
from all walks of life! 
  Let us combine the ranks of national, democratic, and 
patriotic forces into one! 
  Let us wage struggles with unity and achieve unity with 
struggle! 
  All people! Overthrow the aggressors and nation-sellers and 
hasten the coming of independence, democracy, and reunification! 
  These were the Declaration on the Current Situation and the 
Immediate Fighting Slogans, which were adopted at an enlarged 
meeting of the Standing Committee of the SKNDF Central Committee.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 4 January editorial: "Let Us Strenuously </F>
Advance Toward a New Victory With Revolutionary Optimism"] 
  [Text] All party members and working people are now 
vigorously accelerating the grand socialist march with a high 
sense of spirit by upholding the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song's New Year address. 
  This year is the year of a revolutionary upturn in which our 
country's socialist construction enters a new stage of 
development, as well as the rewarding year of struggle in which 
the entire party, the whole country, and all people should be 
mobilized to effect a great revolutionary upsurge on all fronts. 
  To make the New Year 1994 become a historic year of an 
upsurge in our country's revolution and construction, all party 
members and working people must continue to fight more 
strenuously and vigorously than ever before with revolutionary 
optimism. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: 
Optimistically living and struggling with a faith in victory is 
a noble character of revolutionaries. 
  Revolutionary optimism is an ideological and spiritual 
driving force, enabling the people to endlessly embark upon the 
revolutionary road. It is also a firm faith in the justness and 
invincibility of the revolutionary cause that the party and the 
leader [suryong] are leading, as well as a strong revolutionary 
spirit to overcome trials and obstacles with a smile without the 
slightest vacillation. 
  For the people to endlessly carry out revolution, they 
should 
vigorously fight on with revolutionary optimism. Our people are 
the proud and revolutionary people who are creating the 
socialist heroic epic with revolutionary optimism under the 
leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. 
  The socialist road on which our people have embarked was the 
road of an ardent struggle leading to obstacles and trials. 
However, our people have vigorously struggled with a firm faith 
that one can surely win victory only if one moves forward under 
the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. As a 
result, they could defeat the strong imperialist enemies who 
were proud of their numbers and technologies. Also, they could 
establish strong, independent, self-reliant, and self-defensive 
socialist country on a lump of ashes in which everything was 
destroyed. The spirit of revolutionary optimism became a major 
spiritual source in leading the people to win a great victory 
and to perform a world-shaking miracle in the socialist 
construction. 
  The more we face the difficult and heavy tasks, the more we 
make strenuous efforts to implement them filled with conviction 
and optimism. This is a traditional trait of our people. 
  The spirit of revolutionary optimism, which was created from 
the beginning by the first generation revolutionaries of the 
Korean revolution, has been handed down to generation after 
generation. This spirit is also being displayed more highly in 
today's struggle in which socialism of our own style is 
consummated under the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  Last year, our people could resolutely smash challenges by 
the imperialists; firmly safeguard and adhere to the socialist 
cause of our own style; and highly demonstrate the might of 
chuche Korea. This is because all people are firmly united 
around the party and the leader [suryong] and fight on with full 
conviction and optimism. 
  When the country and the revolution were faced with a stern 
trial, our people, without any vacillation, turned out as one to 
resolutely smash [chitpusida] the enemies' challenges and 
aggressive maneuvers with invincible conviction and roaring 
spirits, and brilliantly adorned the final year of the Third 
Seven-year Plan by vigorously accelerating the socialist 
economic construction. 
  Through the last year's harsh trials and struggle, our 
people 
have come to cherish deep in their hearts the firm conviction 
that as long as we have the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who 
possesses an iron will and seasoned leadership we wil easily win 
victory over any formidable enemy and will triumphantly advance 
toward the socialist cause. 
  We have before us glorious yet heavy tasks of vigorously 
accelerating the general onward march of socialism so as to add 
luster to the socialism of our own style while upholding the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year's address. 
  We are building socialism in a sharp confrontation with the 
enemy. By thoroughly carrying out the revolutionary economic 
strategy of our party in this year, we should consolidate the 
foundations of the nation's independent economy solid as a rock 
and further improve the people's standard of living to meet the 
socialist requirements. 
  Today's situation and enormous tasks lying before us call on 
all the party members and working people more than ever before 
to stir up themselves in a struggle to advance toward a new 
victory with revolutionary optimism. The conviction of victory 
and revolutionary optimism are our invincible ideological and 
spiritual weapon in the general march of socialism at the 
present time. 
  The key to consolidating and developing the single-minded 
unity of our revolutionary ranks around the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong- il as well as the way to create a history of great 
revolutionary upsurge by highly displaying the revolutionary 
spirit of self- reliance and arduous struggle lie the fact that 
all the people have the conviction of victory and revolutionary 
optimism. 
  "Let us strive harder and advance toward a new victory with 
revolutionary optimism," this is an important militant slogan 
which our party and people must hold high now. When we strive 
harder and work militantly with revolutionary optimism, we can 
brilliantly fulfill programmatic tasks set forth in the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address and further 
display the might of the socialism of our own style. 
  What is important in winning a new victory, full of 
revolutionary optimism, is that the entire people have the 
unshakable will and faith that they will surely win when they 
advance under the leadership of our party. For those who do the 
revolution, there should a spiritual support. Those who have a 
strong will and conviction for their party and people do not 
waver in whatever circumstances and do not fear of any 
difficulties. 
  The spiritual support for our people is the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il. All the party members and working people 
must always keep in mind the conviction of victory and the 
future of the revolution, deeply understanding his greatness. 
Loudly singing the song "We Will Win Because You Are Leading 
Us," we must have a strong will, fearing no difficulty, 
adversity and formidable enemy as long as we have the dear 
comrade leader. 
  All the party members and working people must also be firmly 
convinced of the invincibility of the cause of the socialism of 
our own style which is vigorously advancing under the banner of 
the great chuche idea. 
  Our cause of socialism is a just cause that fulfills the 
most 
noble idea of the popular masses and an invincible cause that 
has been smoothly adhered to without a hitch by withstanding any 
upheaval of history. The fact that our country shines as a 
fortress of socialism at a time when socialism has been 
frustrated in some countries and anti-socialist foul winds sweep 
the world displays the invincibility and justness of our 
revolutionary cause. 
  We should deeply realize the superiority of the popular 
masses- centered socialism of our own style which provides a 
creative and independent livelihood for the popular masses by 
comparing our proud reality with the tragic realities of 
countries where socialism has been frustrated. 
  We must fight resolutely with hope for and confidence in 
the bright prospects of our economy, which is being developed 
vigorously according to the party's revolutionary economic 
strategies, and the future when more bountiful and civilized 
lives will blossom. 
  Having revolutionary optimism is all the more important to 
guiding officials who command the revolution. Experience shows 
that when officials work with overflowing confidence and 
optimism, the masses will become enthusiastic and the entire 
country will be filled with confidence in victory. 
  All guiding officials must thoroughly demonstrate, in their 
work and lives, the indomitable revolutionary spirit and 
revolutionary optimism of the fallen anti-Japanese 
revolutionaries who maintained their fidelity as the great 
general's revolutionary warriors, saying that they could see a 
revolutionary victory even though their eyes had been plucked 
out. Our officials must loudly sing songs of struggle filled 
with confidence and optimism when they sing; walk filled with 
enthusiasm and high spirits when they walk; and always lead 
optimistic lives. 
  To live and fight with revolutionary optimism, our officials 
and workers must learn the ideological and spiritual world of 
Comrade Yi In-mo. Comrade Yi In-mo has genuine revolutionary 
optimism in that he firmly believed in the victory of our 
revolutionary cause led by the party and the leader [suryong], 
overcame horrible tortures and punishments and persistent 
appeasement, and maintained his fidelity as a revolutionary. 
  Comrade Yi In-mo's noble spiritual world is fully shown in 
his poem dedicated to the dear leader. An idea contained in his 
dedicated poem is that the road to which the dear comrade leader 
is leading us and which he points is the most correct and just 
road on which we can always win. Such confidence and will 
signifies revolutionary optimism, which we must possess. Such 
devotedness is the philosophy of the revolutionaries and leads 
one to the revolutionaries' noble spiritual world. 
  All party members and workers must live, cherishing deep in 
their hearts the idea contained in the poem Comrade Yi In-mo 
dedicated to the dear comrade leader with single-minded loyalty. 
  For party organizations of all levels to strengthen 
organizational and political work is important for making all 
party members and workers strenuously live and fight filled with 
revolutionary optimism and confidence. In step with today's 
situation and environment, party organizations must give 
priority to strengthening education in revolutionary optimism 
and the greatness of the party and the leader [suryong]. 
  Party organizations must positively carry out work to make 
party members and workers deeply embody the great leader's New 
Year address and the decisions of the 21st Plenary Meeting of 
the Sixth Party Central Committee. In this way, they must make 
the party members and workers speed up their onward march in the 
new year with hope for the future and confidence in the 
revolution's future. 
  Revolutionary optimism sharply contrasts with corrupt and 
decadent antisocialist trends. Party organizations must keep 
reactionary trends -- which the imperialists and the betrayers 
of socialism spread -- from infiltrating into our society, and 
fill the entire society with vigorous revolutionary spirit. 
  The people's struggle today is arduous, the future of the 
struggle is bright, and a victory is certain. 
  At the vanguard of our revolution are the dear leader 
Comrade 
Kim Chong-il, the invincible great party, the invincible 
revolutionary Armed Forces, and the strong self-reliant national 
economy. 
  When all people, filled with revolutionary optimism, 
courageously march forward with high spirits, the victory will 
eternally be ours. 
  Let us all resolutely march forward to win a new victory 
after cherishing deep in our hearts the revolutionary optimism 
that they can win victory when they march under the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership and more single-mindedly unite 
around the party and the leader [suryong].

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- Plenary meetings of 
the provincial (municipal) committees of the Workers' Party of 
Korea were held recently. 
  The plenary meetings discussed tasks of implementing the 
resolution of the 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth Party 
Central Committee. 
  The plenary meeting of the party Central Committee held in 
December last year, on the basis of a deep analysis of the 
practical requirements of socialist construction in Korea, 
decided to set the next three years as a period for adjustment 
in socialist economic construction and put forth strategic 
agriculture first, light industry first and foreign trade first 
policies in this period. 
  The plenary meetings of the provincial (municipal) party 
committees stressed that the Korean people are now faced with an 
honorable task of stepping up socialist economic construction to 
further increase the might of the Korean-style socialism and 
bring its advantages into fuller play, while consolidating the 
achievements made in the implementation of the Third Seven-Year 
Plan. 
  They expressed the determination to implement the party's 
revolutionary economic strategy of directing primary efforts to 
agriculture, the light industry and foreign trade in the period 
of adjustment for socialist economic construction.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 9 (YONHAP) -- Normalization talks 
between Japan and North Korea, suspended for more than a year, 
are likely to resume next month at the earliest, the TOKYO 
SHIMBUN here reported on Sunday. 
  Quoting an official working with the Japanese delegation to 
the talks, the paper said that if the meeting were actually 
resumed, the time would most likely be some time in February 
shortly before or after the third-round U.S.-North Korea 
high-level talks expected to take place next month. 
  The report said North Korea expressed the willingness to 
return to the talks during the visit to Pyongyang by Hajime 
Fukata, a Dietman and organization director of the Japan 
Socialist Party, late last year. 
  Fukata had talks with Hwang Chang-yop, North Korean Workers' 
(Communist) Party international affairs director, during his 
stay in Pyongyang. 
  The normalization talks were last held in November 1992 in 
Beijing when the meeting broke up after Japan demanded a probe 
to determine whether a woman named "Yi Un-hoe" who allegedly 
taught Japanese language to terrorist Kim Hyon-hui was a 
Japanese woman.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- A group of American 
congressmen showed support Monday for South Korean and U.S. 
efforts to solve the North Korean nuclear problem through 
dialogue rather than by punitive sanctions. 
  Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, and other congressmen told Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu that they expect positive progress in ongoing 
negotiations, according to Chang Chai-ryong, director-general of 
the Foreign Ministry's American Affairs Bureau. 
  The U.S. visitors agreed that dialogue, at least for now, is 
the best way of solving the problem, Jang said. 
  The group came to Seoul last week after a field trip to 
Russia and Japan. 
  Nunn was quoted as telling Han that Moscow officials 
explained to him that they opposed North Korea's acquiring 
nuclear weapons. 
  The U.S. senator mainly asked questions, mostly about South 
Korea's evaluation of North Korea-U.S. dialogue, the degree of 
Seoul-Washington cooperation in countering the situation, and 
China's possible contribution to solving the problem. 
  He also is said to have asked about South Korea's position 
on 
possible relations improvement between North Korea and the 
United States once the nuclear question is resolved. 
  When Nunn inquired about the possibility of sanctions if 
dialogue fails, Han said that he hopes to clear up the problem 
before it goes that far, Jang said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The North Korea-U.S. Nuclear Negotiations in </F>
Which the United States Made Compromises"] 
  [Text] A high-ranking U.S. Government official confirmed 
that North Korea and the United States agreed on a one-time 
inspection of seven nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. Therefore, 
it seems that the tedious nuclear tug-of-war has overcome one 
stage for the time being. The result of this negotiation may 
have been a choice under the necessity of avoiding a 
catastrophe. It is a result which is somewhat unsatisfactory. 
  What was agreed upon at the negotiations between North Korea 
and the United States was to carry out limited inspection. This 
is an agreement which is worse than the conditions that were met 
before North Korea announced it would withdraw from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] in March of 1993. North Korea is 
claiming that since it has withheld its withdrawal from the NPT, 
it is not a full member country of the NPT. Therefore, it is 
saying that allowing the one-time inspection is not an 
obligation but a form of cooperation. 
  This does not even meet the condition of the ordinary 
[tongsang] inspection that could have been carried out before 
the demand for inspection was made by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] on unreported nuclear facilities in 
Yongbyon. As such, North Korea is carrying out acts lacking 
international level but on the other hand it is gaining profits. 
North Korea has fulfilled its demand of making us withhold the 
Team Spirit exercise and obtained direct contact with the United 
States since March. While North Korea achieved such results, 
not one demand by our side was met. 
  In the beginning, the United States had demanded that North 
Korea accept complete nuclear inspections. However, the United 
States made a strategic compromise as a last resort to make 
North Korea receive complete nuclear inspections by committing 
North Korea to the NPT system. The U.S. plan is that rather 
than breaking off negotiations, it hopes to maintain a dialogue 
to consecutively resolve issues at the next high-level talks. 
  Therefore, the remaining problem at this point is on how 
negotiations will progress between North Korea and the IAEA to 
discuss the method and time of the inspection. It is uncertain 
whether the IAEA will agree on the method of a one-time 
inspection which will stop at examining the continuity and 
safety of North Korea's nuclear inspection. If such an 
inspection is carried out, it will be regarded as a bad 
precedent. 
  A more important issue is whether North Korea will show a 
sincere attitude in the third round of North Korea-U.S. 
high-level talks as anticipated. Judging from North Korea's 
means of dialogue up until now, we cannot rule out the fact that 
North Korea may lead the high-levdl talks to slow progress by 
launching its offensive in waves through endlessly new 
conditions and proposals. The U.S. strategy is to reach an 
agreement on inspection of unreported facilities at the 
high-level talks but it is expected that there will be many 
critical stages. 
  As a result of its interest in negotiations with the United 
States up until now, North Korea may well treat South-North 
dialogue superficially. That kind of sign has appeared on 
several occasions. We must be prepared to defend our firm 
principle of guaranteeing North Korea's nuclear transparency and 
securing South-North dialogue.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Dubious U.S.-North Korean Nuclear Negotiations"] </F>
  [Text] It can only be desirable that because North Korea 
has decided to receive nuclear inspections of the seven nuclear 
facilities in Yongbyon and begins negotiations for inspections 
with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], a clue to 
the solution of North Korea's nuclear issue could be found. It 
has been learned that the United States and North Korea have 
reached an agreement that if the IAEA begins inspections of 
North Korea's nuclear facilities, the discontinuation of the 
Team Spirit exercise should be announced and the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean talks should begin. Because the third round 
of U.S.-North Korean talks is expected to discuss the issue of 
improving U.S.-North Korean relations and economic cooperation 
and is expected to greatly change and develop North Korean-U.S. 
and North Korea-Japanese relations, attention is focused on the 
sincerity of North Korea, which is to receive inspections. 
  However, as we watch the solution of North Korea's nuclear 
issue, we have mixed feelings and are rather displeased because 
there are not just one or two dubious things about the 
U.S.-North Korean negotiations. First, even though it is said 
that North Korea's nuclear issue is "nearly settled," the United 
States and North Korea have not revealed the contents of the 
agreements they have reached. That is, they have not revealed 
what procedure and which method will be used to resolve North 
Korea's nuclear issue. We cannot know whether there is a tacit 
understanding with the ROK or the issue of persuading the ROK 
has not been completed. Second, the opinions of the United 
States and North Korea over the method of inspecting the seven 
facilities are incongruous. We are bewildered because North 
Korea says that it will receive the IAEA's nuclear inspection 
just once; the United States stresses that the continuity of 
nuclear safeguards accord should be maintained. Third, when on 
earth can the North-South dialogue be resumed in the wake of the 
"settlement" and what will become of mutual nuclear inspections? 
This question is as obscure as ever. We cannot but doubt about 
why our government keeps silent even though it has stressed 
close cooperation with the United States. 
  We should never overlook the "just one inspection" if it is 
true, as claimed by North Korea. The fact that just in order to 
reinspect the seven facilities, a year after the IAEA already 
inspected them as many as six times in 1992, and in order to 
replace the monitoring films and batteries, the United States 
has been strained for nearly 10 months over the North Korea's 
nuclear commotions and that it will offer diplomatic relations 
and economic cooperation to North Korea cannot be anything but 
nonsense. 
  When the main U.S. press pointed out that the one time 
inspection is a great concession, the U.S. Government, saying 
"inspecting seven facilities is a great advance," stressed the 
continuity of the nuclear safeguards accord. The United States 
may think that North Korea will be forced to constantly receive 
inspections in exchange for economic cooperation. However, it 
is doubtful whether North Korea will truly and easily respond to 
receiving inspections. 
  Regarding the issue of resuming North-South dialogue and 
mutual inspections, after the summit talks with President 
Clinton last November, President Kim Yong-sam stressed that the 
solution of North Korea's nuclear issue involves "a thorough and 
broad-scale approach method." Speaking at the New Year's press 
conference, President Kim Yong-sam said "dialogue and mutual 
inspections cannot be absolutely excluded" in resolving North 
Korea's nuclear issue and "it is the firm position of the United 
States and the ROK that the IAEA inspections and mutual 
inspections should be conducted at the same time." However, the 
U.S. side still has not announced a clear schedule, nor has it 
declared its promise to put into practice mutual inspections. 
  In fact, if North Korea's nuclear transparency could be 
completely ensured through any organization or method, we would 
not need to insist on mutual inspections. The IAEA can inspect 
the facilities that North Korea reported to the IAEA. On the 
other hand, mutual inspections means that each party can 
mutually inspect all facilities, including the facilities that 
are not reported. Thus, mutual inspections should be realized 
without fail. Of course, U.S.-North Korean negotiations have 
not been completed yet and we will have to watch the first step 
taken by the U.S. and North Korea, that is, the IAEA-North 
Korean inspection negotiations. However, all suspicions should 
be cleared up without fail. The government should explain the 
process of nuclear negotiations and the direction the solution 
of the nuclear issue is taking.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Where Is the `Special Inspection' Issue?"] </F>
  [Text] The North Korean nuclear issue was caused by the 
demand by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] for 
special inspections [tukpyol sachal] of the two unreported 
facilities [sisol] in Yongbyon, North Korea. Without the two 
facilities, the quarrel for the past year over North Korea's 
nuclear development would not have occurred. Now when a 
conclusion of U.S.-North Korean negotiations on the nuclear 
issue is reportedly near-at-hand, the special inspection issue 
has been placed outside the argument. 
  Is the nuclear issue really solved if special inspections 
are 
not addressed? The third round of U.S.-North Korean talks can 
be held, but cannot be considered progress in guaranteeing North 
Korean nuclear transparency. 
  Nuclear inspections by the IAEA begin with specific 
inspections [tukchong sachal]. A specific inspection means 
confirming a list of nuclear materials reported by a signatory 
of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] by comparing it 
with an on-the-spot inspection. When the IAEA fulfills a 
specific inspection of a NPT signatory, the signatory has to 
inform the IAEA of the design of its facilities engaged in 
preservation and research of nuclear materials. After receiving 
such information, the IAEA installs monitoring video tape 
recorders to inspect the facilities. We call this ordinary 
inspections [tongsang sachal]. 
  Inspections of only reported facilities are not sufficient 
nuclear inspections. The inspection of unreported, suspicious 
facilities can help in guaranteeing each country's nuclear 
transparency. This is a special inspection. After inspecting a 
nuclear waste specimen of North Korea in the course of its 
specific and ordinary inspections of the country, the IAEA 
suspected that high-density plutonium had been extracted without 
being reported. This is why the IAEA wants to see the North 
Korean facilities. 
  The United States said that it had given up the special 
inspection of the North Korean nuclear facilities because it 
wanted to maintain the continuation of at least ordinary 
inspections. It also said that it may find a resolution of 
special inspections during the third round of U.S.-North Korean 
talks. 
  Judging from the North Korean attitude shown up to the 
present time, I cannot help but point out that there is no 
likelihood of the success of the U.S. approach. North Korea 
agreed to allow ordinary inspections of its seven reported 
facilities and to hold South-North working-level contacts for an 
exchange of envoys in return for the resumption of high-level 
talks with the United States and suspension of the Team Spirit 
exercise. This is nothing but a one-sided concession made by 
the United States because it will enable North Korea to assume a 
highhanded attitude in South-North working-level contacts 
without allowing practical nuclear inspections and to hold 
negotiations with the United States on various pending issues -- 
such as the establishment of diplomatic relations, the issue 
concerning light-water reactors, and the issue of signing a 
peace treaty -- after the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise. 
  The United States cannot exercise overall nuclear control 
over North Korea by this approach. It is nothing more than 
overlooking the nuclear development of unreliable countries. It 
will obviously strike a serious blow to the plan for the 
limitless extension of the term of the NPT, which is supposed to 
expire in 1995. The United States will have difficulties in 
leading the new world order of the post-cold war era if it loses 
the confidence of Asian countries, which are sensitive to the 
nuclear issue.

<F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "No Concessions to North Korea"] </F>
  [Text] We are paying close attention to news reports that 
North Korea has agreed to only a one-time international 
inspection of seven declared nuclear sites but has avoided a 
much more serious issue -- IAEA [International Atomic Energy 
Agency] access to undeclared sites, especially two nuclear waste 
dumps needed to verify clearly whether Pyongyang has been 
building nuclear weapons. 
  At this moment we do not expect the U.S. to knuckle down to 
the crafty ploys of Pyongyang, whose words have been seen in the 
past to bear absolutely no relation with its intentions. Nor 
will it allow North Korea to wring out of it concessions in 
their negotiations because it will also have learned that the 
North, if given an inch, will take a mile. 
  Despite the reported accord, as U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher pointed out Thursday [6 January] in an 
interview, the U.S. and its allies still face some difficult and 
sensitive steps before they reach the goal of regular 
inspections and a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. 
  As far as the nuclear issue is concerned, the fundamental 
question is whether North Korea has really cast aside its 
intention to go nuclear. We are particularly suspicious of what 
appears to be North Korea's strategy to sidestep the crucial 
issue by allowing only an inadequate single inspection. 
  It cannot be denied that North Korea has delayed things as 
long as possible anticipating a slip in the basic U.S. position 
on North Korea which it will exploit for all it is worth. 
  In this connection, both the U.S. and the IAEA must play 
their cards carefully in their separate talks with North Korea, 
not unilaterally giving in to North Korea's persistent demand 
for U.S. diplomatic recognition and cancellation of the Team 
Spirit military exercise. We stand to lose more than we gain if 
we resort to a hasty approach in dealing with North Korea.

<F P=106> [Seoul YONHAP in English at 0942 GMT on 7 January transmits </F>
the following item together with a note stating that it is to 
replace a previously transmitted version; the earlier replaced 
version was published in the South Korea section of the 7 
January East Asia DAILY REPORT, page 17, under the headline 
"NNSC Official Warns Against Pressing DPRK"] 
  [Text] Panmunjom, Korea, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- An official of 
the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) agrees with 
those who think it is not the interest of any nation to see 
problems arising in the Korean peninsula because of the North 
Korean nuclear issue. 
  "There could be a danger of having something that no one 
wants to see happening," Maj. Gen. Bernard Sandoz, chief Swiss 
member on the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), 
said Friday, warning of tremendous repercussions in case 
concerned parties try to carry the nuclear issue to extremes. 
  "Be patient," Sandoz, asked about prospects of Korean 
reunification, said in an exclusive interview with YONHAP 
reporters at the Swiss Club inside the truce village of 
Panmunjom. 
  "It is not in the interest of South Korea, China, Japan or 
the United States to see a failed reunification taking place in 
Korea," he said. 
  While hailing the progress in Pyongyang-Washington dialogue 
in solving the nuclear situation, the major general noted that 
North Korea and the United States must build mutual confidence. 
  By 1996 North Korea claimed it has come close to meeting 
U.S. 
terms only to see Washington move away by attaching more 
conditions to better relations, and so North Korea is now 
demanding a package deal to resolve the nuclear question, he 
said. 
  "Yongbyon seems to be the only card in their (North Korean) 
game," he said, referring to the site of suspected nuclear 
facilities involved in secretive arms development. 
  U.S. concern for peace and stability in Northeast Asia is 
well understood, Sandoz said, but it is also important for North 
Korea to obtain something in return. 
  The 58-year-old general, a diplomat by profession, has been 
at his post since August 1990 and witnessed changes in 
inter-Korean relations and the status of the commission, 
established in 1953 at the end of a three-year Korean war to 
oversee the Armistice Agreement. 
  All official contact between North Korea and the NNSC was 
broken off in May 1991 by Pyongyang, a result of North Korea's 
protest against the appointment of the first South Korean chief 
of the Military Armistice Commission in March that year. 
  "It's very frustrating to be here and not be able to fulfill 
the mission completely because of the boycott," he told YONHAP. 
  He said they had to accept other channels of dialogue such 
as 
the ongoing working-level talks between North Korea and the 
United States in New York. 
  Despite North Korea's insistence on dissolving the NNSC, 
Sandoz said, the commission will stay until the Armistice 
Agreement is replaced by a peace treaty. 
  The Armistice Agreement is the only legal base, he said, and 
the NNSC is part of this legal base. 
  "We will stay until both sides (South and North Korea) agree 
we should leave," he said. "This is the official position of the

  [Text] Minister of Trade and Industry Kim Chol-su revealed 
on 10 January that if North Korea's nuclear issue is resolved, 
the South-North trade will be changed into a direct trading 
system and cooperation in the resource and energy fields will be 
promoted on a full-scale. 
  In an interview with YONHAP on 10 January, Minister Kim 
said: 
"In preparation for the resolution of the nuclear issue, the 
government is hastening its preparations to change South-North 
trade to direct trade. In energy, possibilities of supplying 
South Korea's electricity to North Korea and of bringing in 
North Korean coal and zinc ingots are being examined." 
  In connection with the Samsung Group's advance into the 
automobile industry, Minister Kim said that a decision will be 
made based on the result of the research on "The Vision and 
Direction of Development of the ROK Automobile Industry for the 
21st Century," conducted by the Industrial Research Institute in 
April.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 7 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry on 
Friday denied as "groundless" the North Korean charge that South 
Korea and the United States have been staging a joint war 
exercise threatening North Korea. 
  The North KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, monitored here, 
claimed 
earlier in the day that South Korea and the United States were 
using more than 360 F-16 and other war planes in a bombing 
practice with major facilities deep in North Korea as potential 
targets.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 9 (YONHAP) -- The government is 
studying multi-pronged ways to address to the human rights 
conditions of North Korea step by step in the future. 
  A source at the National Unification Board said on Sunday 
the 
measures being reviewed are for implementation in two separate 
stages: One for the period of reconciliation and cooperation 
and the other for the period of South-North Commonwealth. 
  In the initial stage, the source said, the government plans 
to call for improved human rights conditions in the North in 
collusion with international human rights organizations like the 
Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red 
Cross. 
  Through these organizations, Seoul would ask Pyongyang to 
allow, for instance, visits by human rights inspectors and stop 
perpetrating torture and all other forms of maltreatment of 
prisoners. 
  Another method under review is to adopt a human rights 
manifesto applicable to all member countries in return for 
economic cooperation for North Korea when a Northeast Asian 
multilateral security dialogue involving North Korea is held. 
  The source said that when inter-Korean exchanges and 
cooperation are promoted in earnest, the South could extend 
support to the North with emphasis on those areas which could be 
helpful to elevating the quality of the North Koreans' lives, 
the source said. 
  In this stage, efforts could also be made to resolve the 
dispersed family question on a priority basis without linking it 
to political questions, he said. 
  The source said the board also feels the need to think about 
the method of obtaining the release of political prisoners and 
facilitating the reunion or meeting of displaced families in 
return for some prices. 
  He noted that before their integration, West Germany paid 
3,440 million marks in all to East Germany from 1963 to 1989 to 
have the communist regime set free 34,000 political prisoners 
and allow the reunion of 250,000 dispersed families. 
  Measures reserved for the stage of a South-North 
Commonwealth 
are centered on the promotion of mutual opening of the press. 
  In this stage the South could one-sidedly lift control on 
the 
viewing of North Korean television programs or subscribing to 
North Korean newspapers, and, based thereon, ask North Korea to 
reciprocate it, the source added.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Yong-tok predicted Monday that Pyongyang will agree to resume 
inter- Korean talks once enough time has passed. 
  "Pyongyang will soon recognize that mutual nuclear 
inspection 
between South and North Korea to implement the South-North non- 
nuclear declaration is an unchangeable position of South Korea 
and the United States as Pyongyang-Washington negotiations make 
progress," Yi, who is also unification minister, told the 
National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National Unification 
Committee. 
  The two Koreas were negotiating an exchange of special 
envoys 
when working-level contacts were abruptly suspended by the North 
in early November last year. Seoul had asked that the special 
envoys discuss the North Korean nuclear problem and summit 
talks, but Pyongyang insisted they should only talk about a 
summit. 
  "We cannot rule out the possibility that an exchange of 
special envoys to settle North Korea's nuclear problem can be 
realized and that, with gradual settlement of the nuclear 
problem, inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation in the fields of 
personnel and materials will be promoted little by little," he 
said. 
  Yi said he also expected North Korea to propose a contact 
and 
exchange of personnel with private organizations in South Korea 
in a bid to weaken the government's position. 
  North Korea, which has reinforced its underground military 
facilities and saved enough war materials to fight without 
outside help for up to five months, is expected to maintain its 
war mobilization posture this year, he said. 
  "North Korea is developing a SCUD-E (Nodong-2) missile as a 
strategic weapon and has expanded its SCUD regiment to a SCUD 
brigade," he said. 
  Yi explained the government's basic policy on the North and 
said that the government, if it judges that North Korean nuclear 
transparency is secured, will begin putting into practice the 
projects contained in the basic and attached North-South 
agreements. 
  "The reunion of divided family members, which could help 
alleviate their agony and sadness, should not be delayed any 
longer. It is a basic human matter transcending ideology and 
political system," he said. 
  To bring about reunions, Seoul will establish a meeting 
house 
in Panmunjom where members of separated families from South and 
North can meet and a post office where mail can be exchanged, he 
said. 
  The South will actively push ahead with consultations with 
the North on ways to allow old people to visit their birthplaces 
in the other half, Yi said.

  [Excerpts] Amid the expectation that North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency will resume contacts early 
this week to adjust their positions regarding the nuclear 
inspection, the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs and 
Reunification Committee held a plenary meeting on 10 January to 
discuss the prospects of the North Korean nuclear issue and 
South-North dialogue after listening to a government report on 
the recent trends in North Korea. 
  The following is a report by reporter Han Yong-kyu from the 
National Assembly: 
  [Begin Han recording] [Passage omitted] In today's report, 
the National Unification Board [NUB] reported that North Korea 
deployed over 40 camps and 300 ground-to- air guns near Yongbyon 
where nuclear facilities are located before and after it 
announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty last year, and that it conducted 21 air drills last year. 
It was also revealed that North Korea reinforced and upgraded 
the branch commands of Yanggang, Chagang, and North Hwanghae 
Provinces to divisions and expanded its SCUD missile regiment to 
brigade. 
  The NUB reported that as a part of North Korea's effort to 
strengthen the system for Kim Chong-il's succession, North Korea 
shifted the Public Security Ministry, an intelligence 
organization, to the National Defense Commission, controlled by 
Kim Chong-il, and strengthened its power. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kim Chong-hwi, who was a top aide to ex-President No 
Tae-u on foreign affairs and national security, is reportedly 
seeking status as a permanent resident of the United States. 
  Kim has been sought by the government since last year for 
his 
alleged involvement in irregularities in the nation's military 
build-up program, Yulgok. 
  A local newspaper report yesterday said Kim, who has been in 
the United States since May 1993, has recently filed an 
application for permanent residentship with the U.S. government. 
  The report added there is possibility that Kim may seek 
political asylum in the United States to avoid Seoul's 
investigation. 
  But officials of the Foreign Ministry in Seoul said they 
have 
no such information. They said the U.S. State Department is 
expected to notify them when such a celebrity as Kim seeks a 
U.S. residentship. But there were no such report from the U.S. 
government concerning Kim, the officials said. 
  Nor has the ministry any plans to inquire with the U.S. 
government about the matter at the moment, they said. 
  The officials doubted the possibility that Kim had filed a 
request with the U.S. government. They said Kim doesn't need 
new permission to stay in America for his visa still holds good 
for a few more years. 
  Kim went to the United States in May 1993, three months 
after 
the inauguration of the Kim Yong-sam government, at the 
invitation of a research institute in Washington. 
  He has not returned home since then, even when his mother 
died late last year.

  [Excerpt] A U.S. court has ordered Ilchin, a ROK company, 
to stop producing industrial diamonds, ruling that Ilchin had 
used General Electric [GE] technology. Ilchin decided not to 
accept the ruling. Therefore, it is expected that an 
intellectual property dispute in trade relations will emerge 
between the ROK and the United States. 
  Yi Kwan-u, who represents Ilchin, said on 8 January: "We 
cannot accept the U.S. court ruling that Ilchin must suspend 
production for the next seven years because it used GE 
technology." He added: "We will immediately appeal the ruling." 
  He also said: "Ilchin and the Korea Advanced Institute of 
Science and Technology developed the technology after three 
years of joint research. We even presented the letter of 
technological research contract to the U.S. court as evidence. 
However, the U.S. court only accepted GE's allegation. We 
cannot understand this." 
  In October 1989, GE filed a suit against Ilchin in a Boston 
court, contending that "Ilchin obtained the core technology from 
(Song Tsienming), a Chinese technician who had left GE." 
  The U.S. court ruled Ilchin lost the case, stating that "it 
should have known that the data the former GE technician 
provided was GE's." However, Ilchin said that it had received 
technological advice from the Chinese technician and had not 
applied in production the technology he provided because most of 
it was outdated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 (YONHAP) -- Leaders of the Citizens' 
Coalition for Economic Justice [CCEJ] delivered a policy 
recommendation to Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang on Monday morning 
that criticises the government's handling of the Uruguay Round 
[UR] trade talks. 
  CCEJ Secretary-General So Kyong-sok said that there had been 
problems during the Uruguay Round talks, and he called on the 
government to take measures to revive agriculture and rural 
economy in coping with rice market opening. 
  So said the lack of experts caused by frequent reshuffles of 
concerned public officials, the absence of an active negotiating 
strategy and the lack of investment in rural areas during 
negotiations were problems noticed in the course of handling the 
UR talks. 
  The government should fully support farmers' and fishermen's 
organizations and the fund for this support should be supplied 
by the non-agricultural and urban sectors, the policy 
recommendation says. 
  While predicting farm products market opening will affect 
not 
only related industries such as fertilizer, farm machinery and 
farm products processing but living conditions in urban areas 
because of migration to cities, it calls on the government to 
take measures as early as possible.

  [Text] The government's new economic team, buckling under 
to mounting pressure from the public and political parties, has 
abandoned its plan to shift its price policy from direct to 
indirect controls. 
  At Friday's meeting of working-level officials on price 
stabilization, the participants decided to resort to old methods 
based on "administrative guidance" to control the prices of some 
commodities and services which have recently shown signs of 
increasing. 
  Among major steps decided in the meeting were to increase 
the 
number of commodities and services to be subject for special 
price control from the previous 20 to 30, including rice, sugar 
and underwear, the prices of which will be curbed within 5 
percent. The government's antitrust watchdog and tax 
authorities will conduct investigations into businesses which 
raise prices. 
  Some businesses, apparently threatened with the government's 
adamant anti-inflationary stance, backed away from their planned 
price hikes. 
  Domestic auto makers, which had announced plans to raise the 
prices of some models by up to 400,000 won ($500), have changed 
their minds. Makers of coffee and soft drinks who have recently 
increased their prices will likely soon follow the example of 
auto companies, industry sources said yesterday. 
  The price spiral has been triggered by the recent remarks of 
Chong Chae-sok, new deputy prime minister and minister of 
economic planning. The government's top economic official, as 
soon as he was inaugurated, made it clear that the government 
will allow some public service charges which had long been 
forced down to go up, reflecting cost-push factors. Chong's 
remarks were followed by actual raise in transportation fares 
and cigarette prices, giving a much-anticipated excuse for 
private industries to follow the government's example. 
  Chong, faced with mounting concerns in various sectors of 
society about the resurging specter of inflation, later 
retreated from his initial position, which he said was aimed at 
respecting market forces and giving a freer hand to the private 
sector to strengthen competitiveness. 
  Thanks to the swift return to old inflation-combating 
methods, the brief but turbulent social turmoil rooted in deep 
fears about price pressure will likely subside, at least for the 
moment. 
  Damaged amid this uproar will once again be the 
administrative credibility, analysts said. Also, price 
stabilization will likely re-emerge as the most contentious 
issue in Korean society this year, when and if the government 
appears to let up its tight inflationary control, they said. 
  The price controversy which hit the domestic economy from 
the 
start of 1994, however, should in no way affect the new economic 
team's much-heralded policy switch to give priority to market 
force and the private sector, the analysts said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Choe Song-chin] </F>
  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam Thursday [6 January] declared 
1994 as the year for strengthening Korea's international 
competitiveness, a proclamation which surprised few. The 
President's first year in office, despite many remarkable 
achievements in political and social arenas, lost some of its 
luster because of his failure to bring about the much-hoped-for 
economic recovery. 
  Even the "new economic five-year plan" ambitiously launched 
by Kim's administration could hardly turn the adverse economic 
tide at home and abroad in its first year, which ended with 
rather disappointing economic growth of 4.9 percent. On top of 
this, the recent conclusion of global free trade talks will 
expose domestic industry to fiercer competition than ever with 
foreigners. 
  Taking the nation's economic helm at this difficult moment 
was Chong Chae-sok, who was sworn in as the new deputy prime 
minister and minister of the Economic Planning Board (EPB) in 
last December's cabinet reshuffle, which also affected 13 other 
ministers. Ever since his inauguration more than two weeks ago, 
the 63-year-old new EPB minister, known for both his economic 
expertise based on long experience and his strong personality, 
has been the focus of attention within the government and 
business circles. In a joint written interview with the EPB 
press Chong stresses bolder internationalization and 
deregulation as the keys to Korea's economic survival. 
  Q: Korea's internationalizing strategy, though appearing 
quite innovative to Koreans themselves, still falls short of 
meeting foreigners' expectations. Can't you come up with a 
bolder market-opening program, including a complete lifting of 
bans on capital movement? 
  A: To induce more foreign capital, we need to change our way 
of thinking as a whole. Numerous administrative regulations on 
direct foreign investments should be improved and complex 
procedures simplified. 
  More fundamental problems are financial restrictions, poor 
infrastructure and labor problems, which combine to make the 
overall business environment here worse than that in industrial 
countries. Our internationalizing strategy should start with 
improving this business environment not only for foreigners but 
also for domestic companies. 
  Q: Despite the continuous administrative deregulation 
pursued by the Kim administration, businessmen say they hardly 
feel the effect. Why so and how would you overcome the 
bureaucratic resistance to bolder deregulation? 
  A: I have been briefed that out of the 966 targets for 
deregulation, 751 have been completed. The problem is that 
actual implementation of a new system takes some time to be felt 
by business people. 
  With new approaches and resolve, the government will push 
ahead with deregulation. It will soon come up with a more 
systematic and comprehensive program, suited to the diverse 
functions and sectors of businesses. 
  Q: You mentioned the need to raise prices, including public 
service rates, to a "realistic level," which sparked speculation 
among businesses that the new deputy premier had shifted the 
keynote of economic policy from stability to growth. What is 
your position? 
  A: Stability is a must for growth, and the most important 
thing in economic operations is to balance these two elements. 
I will pursue the objective of reinvigorating the economy while 
working for price stabilization, a policy which will be 
explained in detail in this year's economic operation plan to be 
reported to the President next Tuesday. 
  Q: You have often expressed an intention to rectify the 
distorted price structure by raising public service charges when 
the need arises. Is there any change in such position? 
  A: I believe extreme caution is needed in raising public 
service charges in view of their enormous effect on overall 
commodity prices. It is true that the excessive curbing of 
public service rates has resulted in distorting the price 
structure, degrading the price structure, degrading the quality 
of services and weakening our competitive edge. 
  Still, the government will keep the price of public services 
to a minimum level by more efficient management of state-run 
corporations. It also will try to ensure price stabilization of 
daily necessities, minimize the price raise of manufactured 
goods and crack down on illegal or unfair price hikes. 
  Q: Analysts say that limiting wage increases and prevention 
of labor disputes will be the two biggest economic concerns this 
year. What do you think? 
  A: To win in the unlimited competition in the coming era of 
global borderless business, we must have industrial peace and 
technological development. Because all of us know that wage 
increases in excess of productivity gains have been one of the 
biggest factors weakening the nation's competitive edge, I am 
sure that both labor and management will cooperate now. 
  Q: What is your plan to revive the agricultural sector, 
hardest hit by the successful settlement of the Uruguay Round 
trade negotiations? 
  A: So far, farm policy has been a defensive policy of 
protecting the weak sector. From now on, we will turn to a more 
aggressive approach by helping the domestic farm industry 
sharpen its competitive edge. 
  More specifically, the government will accelerate structural 
adjustment, rationalize the farmland ownership system and 
improve the farm administration to better suit the international 
trends. 
  For this purpose, the "Rural Development Tax" will be 
introduced as proposed earlier, and the government will, taking 
the views from all sectors of society into consideration, come 
up with a comprehensive policy package by the end of June. 
  Q: What change have you found in the government's role 
between 1979, when you served as the last trade minister of the 
late President Pak Chong-hui, and now? 
  A: We are now living in a democratized, deregulated and 
internationalized era. The government's role should also change 
from that of a guider to helper. 
  Particularly, it should play the role as the fair supervisor 
of the economy, while supplying social infrastructure, fostering 
human resources and protecting the environment.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 8 (YONHAP) -- The Foreign Ministry 
plans to restructure its trade negotiation team, installing 
bureaus for multilateral economic and environmental issues, 
officials said Saturday. 
  One of the additions, which has been tentatively named the 
"Economic Cooperation and Environment Bureau," will handle talks 
with developing countries. 
  The "Economic Organizations Bureau" will take up 
multilateral 
negotiations such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), World Trade Organization (WTO), Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and U.N. Development 
Program (UNDP). 
  The current International Trade Bureau will be responsible 
for bilateral trade negotiations with added functions in 
aviation and maritime talks, officials said. 
  The changes will be proposed to President Kim Yong-sam in 
the 
ministry's New Year report Jan. 21. 
  The ministry is considering hiring Koreans with foreign 
citizenship for the new bureaus to promote South Korean 
participation in multilateral trade organizations, according to 
the officials. 
  This plan calls for hiring 50 to 100 people of Korean 
ancestry with degrees in economics and professional backgrounds 
in related fields. They will be placed at the foreign and other 
ministries.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 9 (YONHAP) -- Cases of tax evasion by 
some foreign firms in Korea are feared to escalate into 
diplomatic squabbles as their home governments come to their 
rescue showering the Seoul government with a barrage of protests. 
  The National Tax Administration has found out in its 
year-long tax inspection that ICI Korea Co. of the United 
Kingdom and six to seven other foreign firms doing business in 
Korea has dodged large amounts of tax. 
  "The taxes dodged by ICI Korea, BASF Korea and Hoechst Korea 
are especially large, running to the 10- to 20-billion-won level 
each," a government official said on Sunday. Both BASF and 
Hoechst are German firms. 
  The tax inspection was launched in February last year into 
25 
major foreign firms. 
  The official said the tax office will soon wind up the probe 
and formally notify them of the amount of penalty taxes to be 
collected. 
  The foreign firms involved react furiously against the tax 
office's move, lodging protests with the government and 
threatening, in some instances, to withdraw from Korea unless 
the penalty taxes are withdrawn. 
  British Minister of State Alastair Goodlad called on Vice 
Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong during his recent visit to Seoul 
asking him to see to it that the penalty taxes on ICI Korea be 
reassessed downward. 
  Germany and the Netherlands have filed letters of protests 
to 
the Foreign Ministry and tax administration against the penalty 
taxes on their firms in Korea. 
  Besides, the head of the European Chamber of Commerce (ECC) 
in Korea visited the Foreign Ministry to express protest. He 
has gone so far as to flash a petition to the OECD (Organization 
for Economic Cooperation and Development) headquarters at last 
year end against the penalty taxes, a source said. 
  He suggested in the petition that South Korea has been 
imposing undue taxes on foreign firms and should therefore be 
kept from joining the OECD, the source said. 
  An ICI Korea official complained, "foreign trading firms are 
supposed to pay tax only on commission fees they received on 
foreign commodities imported. But, the Korean tax office is 
trying to assess tax on the whole sales of imported goods." 
  He said his firm would have no choice but to seriously 
consider pulling out of Korea if the huge penalty tax is 
actually assessed. 
  South Korean officials say the foreign firms involved have 
expressly dodged taxes in breach of the law of the land and also 
international practices. 
  "Since these firms are fixed business concerns under the tax 
law which directly marketed imported goods locally, they should 
naturally pay taxes on their whole sales," a tax administration 
official said. 
  He said that in light of tax laws both at home and abroad, 
there is no problem at all in the collection of penalty tax 
retroactive to five years before. 
  "It is proper for the tax administration to collect the 
penalty taxes. This is a customary practice done in foreign 
countries as well," a Foreign Ministry official said.

  [Text] A package of new incentives are being drawn up by 
the government to induce more private capital into social 
infrastructure construction projects such as roads and railways. 
  These forays will include allowing private companies to 
introduce commercial loans for investment in facilities and 
granting massive tax breaks to participating companies, an 
official at the Economic Planning Board [EPB] said. 
  At the same time, participating companies belonging to the 
30 
largest business groups will be exempted from the application of 
intricate rules of investment ceiling stipulated in the Monopoly 
Regulation and Fair Trade Act for up to 30 years, the EPB said. 
  The EPB said these incentives will be contained in a new 
draft bill now in the making. It is learned that the government 
is due to complete the formation of the bill by this weekend and 
the bill will go before the Democratic Liberal Party-controlled 
National Assembly for legislation. 
  Officials said these incentives will be effective in 
encouraging private companies to take part in the expansion of 
social overhead capital projects. 
  Specifically, allowing private companies to introduce 
low-interest commercial loans for their investments in 
facilities will boost corporate eagerness to take part in the 
expansion of social overhead capital, the officials said. 
  With regard to tax reductions, the government is allegedly 
planning to cut acquisition, registration and corporate taxes. 
  The government has been preparing legislation to give the 
private sector greater incentives to invest in public-works 
projects in its belief that government spending alone is unable 
to offer a clear-cut solution to the looming shortage of 
infrastructure. [passage omitted] 
  In the past, the government had sought to encourage private 
companies to invest in infrastructure but withdrew its plan in 
the face of strong criticism about any "special favors" for the 
large business conglomerates known as chaebol. 
  Conglomerates, for their parts, were also reluctant to get 
involved in taking part in infrastructure projects as the 
government didn't allow them to charge sufficient tolls to 
recoup their investments. 
  This time, however, the government appears more aggressive. 
"The government is mulling substantial incentives for 
participants to ensure returns on their investments which were 
hardly expected under the past regime," an EPB official said. 
  Under the new law, companies will be given more freedom to 
levy tolls and rents from the public-sector projects in order to 
help them recover their investments more easily. 
  They may also be allowed to build leisure and tourist 
facilities alongside the roads or railways to attract more users.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 8 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry on 
Saturday [8 January] dissolved the joint military-prosecution 
investigation team that was formed to look into an arms purchase 
fraud, and gave the military prosecution the task of hunting 
down the suspected masterminds -- Chu Kwang-yong and Jean-Rene 
Fuan. 
  Chu, Korean agent of the French arms dealer, is believed to 
be either in the United States or Northeast Asia. He fled the 
country Dec. 15. 
  The military prosecution is seeking to catch Fuan in a way 
that minimizes international diplomatic friction, and will 
consult with the Foreign Ministry and maintain close ties with 
law-enforcement agencies in countries such as France. 
  The military prosecution freed an Army colonel and Navy 
captain in charge of overseas procurement at the Defense 
Logistics Agency on Saturday, suspending the charges against 
them. 
  The duo are Col. Yun Sam-song, head of the agency's overseas 
procurement office, and Capt. To Chong-il, a division chief in 
Yun's office. 
  The two officers and a Defense Ministry civilian, who was 
also released, will be referred to a disciplinary panel, a 
Ministry source said. 
  The Ministry said Friday [7 January] the probe had revealed 
that the 6.7 million-U.S.-dollar shell fraud was the product of 
a conspiracy between Fuan and Chu.

  [Text] Concerning Japan-U.S. aviation talks to be held 
following the Japan-U.S. summit in February, the Transport 
Ministry on 6 January decided that it should shelve the question 
of revising the aviation agreement for now, and instead 
concentrate its efforts on the question of the number of flights 
to and from Kansai International Airport, which is due to open 
in September. The Transport Ministry has so far called for a 
revision of the agreement on grounds that it is unfair to Japan. 
  In the negotiations on flights into Kansai so far, the 
United 
States has said that seven companies, including United Airlines 
and Northwest Airlines, want to launch services, bringing the 
number of flights requested by the U.S. airlines to more than 
200 a week -- a number much higher than expected. The United 
States has insisted that "based on the aviation agreement, the 
United States has unlimited rights to fly into Japan. Nor are 
there any limitations on the right to fly from Japan to other 
Asian countries or Australia." 
  In turn, Japan has pointed out that U.S. companies at 
present 
hold a 70-percent market share for flights between Japan and the 
United States. Japan has said that it cannot accept additional 
U.S. flights without limit, which would raise the percentage of 
U.S. services further, and has insisted that a limitation be put 
on the right to fly beyond Japan as well. In addition, Japan 
has called for a revision of the aviation agreement, noting, for 
instance, that U.S. companies can use almost twice the number of 
airports in Japan and the United States that Japanese companies 
can. 
  More recently, however, U.S. demands have become more 
realistic, and companies like United and Northwest have more 
than halved the number of flights they requested for Kansai. As 
a result, now that the time for opening Kansai is nearing, the 
Transport Ministry has decided that it should be able to gain 
more by concentrating its efforts on the question of flights 
into the new airport rather than by seeking a revision of the 
agreement. Michihiko Matsuo, administrative vice minister of 
transport, said: "We will reiterate our position on the question 
of the right to fly beyond Japan, but in the forthcoming talks, 
we would like to concentrate more on the question of flights 
into Kansai rather than on such a grandiose subject as revising 
the agreement."

  [Text] A survey conducted by the Japan External Trade 
Organization [JETRO] on manufacturers with overseas operation 
bases has shown that most of the companies surveyed plan to 
increase "imports back" into Japan of products from their 
operations overseas. About one-fourth of the companies 
expressed concern about hollowing out of the domestic industry. 
The survey was conducted in October by sending out 
questionnaires to 571 manufacturing companies which have 
production bases overseas. A total of 219 companies have 
responded to the questionnaires. 
  The companies which said "we will expand overseas production 
in the next five years" ran to 90.1 percent of the respondents. 
Five years ago, 6.7 percent of the companies answered "our 
overseas production exceeds our domestic production," but the 
recent survey shows 8.5 percent of the companies as having 
produced more overseas than at home, and the survey predicts the 
percentage of these companies to grow to 20.3 percent in five 
years from now. 
  Moreover, while only 41.7 percent said "we will raise 
exports 
in five years from now," 67.8 percent said "we will raise 
`imports back' from their production bases overseas." According 
to the survey, the companies which will "import back" from 
overseas will grow to 75.1 percent in five years from now. 
  Regarding the danger of "industrial hollowing out" that can 
bring reduction in the domestic production and employment as 
well as lowering of capabiliites for technological development, 
65.3 percent answered, "there is such a danger, but we think we 
can avoid that situation by taking appropriate actions," while 
25.3 percent replied "we see that danger well enough" and 8.9 
percent said "we do not foresee that danger at all."

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 7 KYODO -- Trade negotiators from 
Japan and the United States wound up two days of framework trade 
talks Friday [7 January] on the Japanese Government's purchase 
of medical equipment, but reported little progress. 
  Japanese officials who participated in the negotiations said 
the two sides spent an "endless" length of time exchanging ideas 
on drawing up a mutually acceptable draft, but said no agreement 
is in sight. 
  A major sticking point that has bogged down a series of 
working-level negotiations that began last September is a U.S. 
demand for numerical benchmarks to measure import penetration in 
Japanese markets. 
  "There was no progress in this area," a Japanese official 
said. 
  Medical equipment procurement is one of four priority market 
sectors under the Japan-U.S. framework trade accord concluded 
last July. 
  The two governments have promised to come up with an 
agreement by the time Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
meets with President Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11. 
  Japanese officials said the two sides plan to meet again to 
discuss medical equipment procurement, but no date has been set. 
  Trade negotiators from the two countries are scheduled to 
hold talks in Japan next week on the insurance and automobile 
markets. 
  Neither Japanese nor U.S. officials appear optimistic of an 
early breakthrough. 
  "There was no movement at all on the quantitative and 
qualitative indicators," a senior U.S. trade official said 
Friday of the telecommunications framework negotiations. 
  U.S. officials say Washington wants to introduce a multiple 
set of yardsticks to peg import penetration in Japan to the 
other industrial countries. 
  Japanese officials have rejected the U.S. proposal, saying 
Japan cannot accept any criteria that "smack of market share." 
  The framework talks were only one set of trade negotiations 
that took place in Washington between Japan and the U.S. on 
Friday. 
  While Japanese and U.S. negotiators huddled at the Commerce 
Department over medical technology, another group of officials 
met at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office to review the 
purchase of foreign telecommunications equipment by Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. [NTT]. 
  A senior U.S. trade official who spoke to Japanese reporters 
following the NTT session said while Washington is pleased with 
the progress in the amount of foreign equipment purchased by NTT 
in recent years, the U.S. feels the foreign share "should be 
significantly higher." 
  According to Japanese figures, the amount of telecom 
equipment purchased by NTT from foreign suppliers increased to 
100 billion yen in fiscal 1992 from 80 billion yen in fiscal 
1991. 
  Japanese officials said the foreign suppliers accounted for 
14 percent of the high-tech equipment sourced by NTT in fiscal 
1992, compared with 11 percent in fiscal 1991.

  [Text] Hakodate, Hokkaido, Jan. 10 KYODO -- Grains of 
rice which may have been discolored by mold have been found in 
an emergency shipment of rice from Thailand, Hokkaido 
Prefectural Government officials said Monday [10 January]. 
  The discolored rice was discovered in a 5,775-ton shipment 
of 
long-grain rice for food processing that arrived from Bangkok at 
Hakodate Port on January 1. 
  Inspectors found the discolored rice in some of the 
50-kilogram bags that are being unloaded from a 
Panamanian-registered freighter. A total of 1,400 tons of the 
rice had been unloaded through Sunday. 
  The Hakodate Bureau of the Hokkaido Food Office was not 
certain if the discolored rice was like that when it left 
Thailand or if it became discolored during the trip to Japan. 
  The officials said that the rice was not discolored by the 
kind of mold caused by condensation that was found in imported 
rice from Thailand at the port of Maizuru, Kyoto Prefecture last 
month.

  [Excerpts] Phnom Penh, Jan 8, (AFP) -- King Norodom 
Sihanouk has defended Cambodia's human rights record, denying 
that the rights of the country's ethnic Vietnamese are abused. 
  Sihanouk, in a statement released by state news agency AKP 
Saturday, said that apart from Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, the only 
anti-Vietnamese pogroms took place after the then Prince 
Sihanouk was ousted in a 1970 US-backed coup d'etat led by 
General Lon Nol. 
  "The non-Khmer Rouges patriotic Cambodians only struggled 
against the Vietnamese agressors but never allowed the human 
rights of civilian Vietnamese men and women to be violated," 
Sihanouk, who is undergoing surgery for cancer in Beijing, said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Sihanouk said an "Australian personality" made the 
accusation 
during an interview with BBC television. 
  Sihanouk turned the accusation around, asking: "Were the 
white Australians themselves perfectly irreproachable in their 
policies and acts towards the (non-white) ethnic minority who 
were the original owners of Australia?". [passage omitted] 
  Some 20,000 ethnic Vietnamese fishing people fled Cambodia 
in 
the run-up to last May's U.N.-supervised elections to escape a 
Khmer Rouge campaign of ethnic cleansing. [passage omitted] 
  Although many of the families could speak Khmer and had 
fished the waters of the Tonle Sap, Cambodia's great lake, for 
generations and others were married to Cambodians, they found 
themselves stranded as the government would not let them return. 
  Sensitive to the effectiveness of Khmer Rouge propaganda, 
the 
government said it first needed to draft an immigration law. 
  But months later, Minister of Information Ieng Mouli said no 
decision had been made on whether the boat people could return 
as the law had yet to be discussed.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Suharto presenting the 1994-95 budget </F>
to the House of Representatives in Jakarta on 6 January -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Honorable session! The draft 
state budget which I will present to the honorable House is the 
1994-95 draft state budget in the first year of the Sixth 5-Year 
Development Plan. [passage omitted] 
  We should make more concerted efforts to further lower the 
inflation rate in 1994 -- below the 1993 inflation rate. We 
should make wiser and careful decisions concerning our monetary 
and fiscal endeavors. We should also anticipate difficulties in 
obtaining easy access to the supplies of certain commodities -- 
particularly commodities which are important for implementing 
our development projects. In the effort to further improve our 
economic efficiency, we need to continue with the deregulation 
and debureaucratization processes. Several deregulation and 
debureaucratization measures undertaken should be seriously 
implemented and secured at the central and district levels. 
[passage omitted] 
  We still need attractive foreign assistance to further 
hasten 
the pace of our national development. The more we acquire 
attractive foreign assistance, the lesser will be our export and 
commercial credit obligations. As such, our foreign debt burden 
will not impose a heavier burden for us. We truly need to 
upgrade our efficiency in making full use of all existing 
foreign assistance. We must avoid wasting the attractive 
foreign assistance by eliminating all unbeneficial and slow 
development projects. [passage omitted] 
  In my state address on 16 August 1993, I presented the 
estimates that served as the basis for the formulation of the 
Second Long-term Development Masterplan and the sixth Five- Year 
Development Plan as well as the main targets to be achieved. Now 
I want to present the drafts of the sixth Five-Year Development 
Plan and the 1994-95 budget to the honorable session. I hope to 
receive comments from the honorable session and I shall pay 
serious attention to these comments in my efforts to complete 
the formulation of the sixth Five-Year Development Plan. The 
1993 GBHN [Broad Outline of State Policy] stipulates that the 
second Long- term Development Masterplan is a process of 
continuity, intensification, expansion, and renewal of the first 
Long-term Development Masterplan. In the second Long-term 
Development Masterplan, the Indonesian people are entering a 
process of take-off toward the realization of a just, 
prosperous, and autonomous society based on the Pancasila 
ideology. 
  The 1993 GBHN on the fundamentals of development has served 
as a guideline in formulating development plans in the second 
Long-term Development Masterplan. All development efforts must 
be directed at consolidating and strengthening our nation's 
economic independence. To achieve the desired stage of progress 
and independence, we must make the efforts to achieve reasonably 
high economic growth during the second Long-term Development 
Masterplan, or higher than that recorded in the first Long-term 
Development Masterplan, namely, an average of seven percent 
annually. Such an economic growth rate must also be supported 
by a declining population growth rate and be accompanied by 
structural changes in the job market, which should be more 
balanced and productive. The population growth rate must be 
reduced to 0.88 percent annually by the end of the second 
Long-term Development Masterplan from 1.66 percent annually at 
the end of the first Long-term Development Masterplan. If we 
can achieve these two main objectives, per capita income will 
have increased four-fold by the end of the second Long-term 
Development Plan, namely, at about U.S. $2,600, based on the 
prevailing price of goods in the 1989-90 fiscal year. The 
nominal price will automatically be higher. 
  We must promote education to make it more available to the 
people, serve development needs, and produce more qualified 
manpower. An important step in promoting education in the 
second Long-term Development Masterplan is the introduction of 
nine years of compulsory basic education. We only have six-year 
compulsory education now. We must achieve this target in 10 
years, or three Five-year Development Plans at the latest. We 
will not only make education more available, but also upgrade 
its quality. Our education will also be more focussed and 
adjusted to the manpower needs in all fields and sectors of 
development activities. [passage omitted] 
  In the sixth Five-year Development Plan, we will try to 
achieve an average 6.6-percent growth rate annually. We set 
this growth rate lower than the average rate of the second 
Long-term Development Masterplan because of the heavy challenges 
and the need to strengthen our economy. We have set the growth 
rate of the agricultural sector at 3.4 percent, manufacturing 
industry at 9.4 percent, and nonoil and nongas industry at 10.3 
percent. The growth rate of other sectors are projected at six 
percent. At the end of the sixth Five-year Development Plan, 
the growth rate of industrial and agricultural sectors is 
projected at about 24.1 and 17.6 percent respectively. 
  The population growth rate will be reduced to about 1.51 
percent annually at the end of the sixth Five-year Development 
Plan from about 1.6 percent at the end of the fifth Five-Year 
Development Plan. With this level of population growth and 
economic growth, per capita income will surpass U.S. $1,000, or 
an increase of about 4.7 percent. [passage omitted] 
  The improvement of our economy will be reflected in our debt 
situation and we always make efforts to keep it within safe 
limits. Indonesia's [words indistinct] is projected to decrease 
from about 57 percent at the end of the fifth Five-Year 
Development Plan to 45 percent at the end of the sixth Five-Year 
Development Plan. We will also make efforts to reduce the debt 
service ratio [three preceding words in English] from 32 percent 
to 20 percent. 
  Efforts will be made to further reduce the role of foreign 
aid as a source of funds for the development budget during the 
Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. In the meantime, efforts will be 
made to further enhance the role of government savings during 
this period. The share of government savings in the development 
budget is expected to increase from some 62 percent at the end 
of the Fifth 5-Year Development Plan to some 68 percent at the 
end of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. In addition, the debt 
service ratio in the routine expenditure will decrease from some 
45 percent to some 33 percent. [passage omitted] 
  Investments totaling some 660 trillion rupiah will be 
needed during the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. This will be 
78 percent higher than the actual investment during the Fifth 
5-Year Development Plan or 176 percent higher than the projected 
investment for the Fifth 5-Year Development Plan. To achieve 
this target, the role of the business circles must be further 
enhanced because more than 73 percent of the investment is 
expected to come from the people. The source of investment will 
be domestic savings conmprising the government's and people's as 
well as foreign funds. Government savings [words indistinct] 
before the repayment of loans is estimated to reach some 169 
trillion rupiah, while people's savings will amount to some 453 
trillion rupiah. Foreign funds are estimated to total some 37 
trillion rupiah. Government funds to finance development 
projects during the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan are estimated 
to amount to 443.5 trillion rupiah made up of 382 trillion 
rupiah from internal revenue and 61.5 trillion from foreign 
loans. Meanwhile, routine expenditure is estimated to reach 
267.6 trillion and development expenditure 175.9 trillion 
rupiah. The state budget is estimated to grow by an average of 
12.4 percent annually in the next five years. 
  Ladies and gentlemen! Internal revenue is estimated to 
increase from 59.7 trillion rupiah in the first year of the 
Sixth 5-Year Development Plan to 97.3 trillion rupiah in the 
last year of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan. Internal 
revenue will be optimally increased from the nonoil and nongas 
sector, particularly various taxes. For this end, intensive and 
extensive campaigns will be launched to exploit taxes, the 
actual collection of which is lower than their potential. 
[passage omitted] 
  A total of 11.9 million new jobs are expected to be created 
through various efforts and on the basis of a projected 6.2 
percent annual economic growth. The agricultural sector is 
expected to absorb some 1.9 million workers, the industrial 
sector some three million, and other sectors seven million. 
Thus, the rate of open [terbuka] unemployment will be reduced 
to 0.8 percent at the end of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan 
from an estimated 3.2 percent in 1990. [passage omitted] 
  Honorable Speaker, allow me to briefly outline the 
perspective and direction of the draft budget for the several, 
major sectors in the upcoming Sixth Five-Year Development Plan. 
In the plan, about 6.4 trillion rupiah will be allocated to the 
agriculture and forestry sectors. The irrigation sectors will 
receive an allocation of 10.4 trillion rupiah, which will cover 
the cost of the expansion of water resources, including 
irrigation. During this development plan, the irrigation sector 
will be an independent sector, taking into account its 
increasingly important role vis a vis the other nonagricultural 
sectors such as the industrial, housing, health, and environment 
sectors. 
  Regarding the infrastructure sector, the transportation 
sector will receive a large allocation of 33 trillion rupiah. 
Of this amount, 22 trillion rupiah will be allocated for the 
construction of road infrastructure. The major road 
infrastructure will be concentrated outside Java, including the 
construction of roads in the rural regions. Apart from this, 
the large amount of 21.3 trillion rupiah has also been allocated 
toward improving energy resources, including the development of 
a rural electrical supply. By the end of the Sixth Five-Year 
Development Plan, it is hoped that 79 percent of the community 
will be able to enjoy an electricity supply compared with only 
49 percent at the end of the Fifth Five- Year Development Plan. 
  The education sector receives one of the highest amounts in 
the draft budget. In the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan, the 
education sector will receive an allocation of 20.3 trillion 
rupiah, which includes the budget for national culture. The 
health sector will be given greater attention. During the next 
five years, a budget of 8 trillion rupiah will be allocated to 
the health and population sectors. Housing and community 
development sectors will receive an allocation of 5.7 trillion 
rupiah; this is intended to hasten the pace of construction of 
houses for low-income groups. 
  An estimate of 3.62 trillion will be allocated for the 
science and technology sector. This includes expenditures for 
the aerospace and maritime sectors, which have been merged and 
which should be given more attention. 
  One of the highest allocations in the budget, standing at 
34.2 trillion rupiah or 19.45 percent of the total development 
budget for the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan, is for the 
regions and the transmigration sector. Regional development 
will be intensified toward a more equitable distribution of 
development and a more concrete, dynamic, harmonious, and 
responsible regional autonomy. [passage omitted] 
  We have been unable to utilize our economic capacity to its 
fullest because efficiency and productivity are still below par. 
As yet, neither a much needed system nor regulations to support 
our economic institutions has been able to fully function as 
expected. 
  In addition, even though there are indications that the 
global economic situation is heading toward reform, a feeling of 
instability still prevails. Any increase in exports will face 
heavy obstacles. The emergence of economic blocs was brought 
about by political issues which have been interlinked with trade 
and economic cooperation and also by the existence of new, 
progressive, and competitive nations. These are factors which 
could affect our efforts toward increasing our exports. We 
could possibly be faced with stiffer challenges in our efforts 
to attract the much-desired foreign resources. 
  Apart from this, our future plans will also be influenced by 
oil prices, which are ever declining even though our dependence 
on oil has been lessened. But in the next five years the role 
of oil will have a greater influence on our national income and 
revenues. All these factors should be seriously taken into 
account when charting our future plans. With the implementation 
of the GATT agreement in 1994, it is hoped that global trading 
conflicts will be further lessened. This will provide greater 
opportunities for us to increase our exports in international 
markets. However, we will have to face certain consequences. 
Undoubtedly, our internal market will then be fully opened. 
This means that our internal market will face greater 
competition. In that case, we will have no alternative but to 
upgrade the competitiveness of our internal production with the 
aim of further widening our export markets. 
  Honorable members, bearing in mind the global economic 
situation and based on what we have achieved thus far, we have 
formulated the 1994-95 draft budget. We plan to set a balanced 
budget for the first year of the upcoming Sixth Five-Year 
Development Plan at 69.7 trillion rupiah, which means a 11.9 
percent increase over the current budget. The national income 
from revenues is estimated at 59.7 trillion rupiah and the 
income from development is estimated at 10 trillion rupiah. 
This means that the national income is more than 85 percent of 
the overall income. Routine expenditure is estimated at 42.3 
trillion rupiah, while development expenditure will be set at 
27.4 trillion rupiah. It can be observed from the total amount 
that the national expenditure stands at 17.4 trillion rupiah or 
10.3 percent more than the state expenditure in the existing 
budget. Domestic income, which is 59.7 trillion rupiah, is 
derived from the oil and gas sector, which amounts to 12.8 
trillion rupiah, and income from the nonoil and nongas sector is 
46.9 trillion rupiah. The income from the nonoil and nongas 
sector makes up 78.6 percent of the total domestic income. This 
development is very heartening because the national income is 
becoming stronger and we are confident of weathering any 
external turbulence. The income from the gas and oil sector is 
still needed as one of the major sources of income providing 
assistance in funding national development. However, with the 
increasingly important role of revenues, we should not be fully 
dependent on the income from the oil and gas sector. Following 
the sharp decline of oil prices in 1986 -- a decline which has 
continued up to now, except for the Gulf crisis in 1990 -- the 
crude oil price was at around U.S.$16-17 per barrel; however, at 
the end of 1988 the crude oil price was only U.S.$11-12 per 
barrel. Therefore, we should be wary and should not hope for 
crude oil prices to increase again. Recently, there were signs 
that the crude oil price would again decline because of 
weakening demand from the industrialized countries and 
speculation that Iraqi crude oil would re-enter the world market. 
  The crude oil price has been estimated at U.S.$16 per barrel 
in the 1994-95 draft budget based on these developments. 
Therefore, based on these calculations and the production of 
1.5 million barrels per day, receipts from the gas and oil 
sector in the 1994-95 draft budget are expected to amount to 
12.8 trillion rupiah. Receipts from the nongas sector amounting 
to 46.9 trillion rupiah come from the services sector -- 40.1 
trillion rupiah; the nontax sector -- 4.3 trillion rupiah; and 
net oil profits -- 2.3 [figure as heard] trillion rupiah. 
  The receipts from taxes indicate their important and 
strategic role in development as a source of funds. This can be 
seen from the high amount received from taxes. The receipts 
from taxes in the Fifth Five-Year Development Plan were at an 
annual average rate of 22 percent. The income from taxes for the 
1994-95 draft budget is estimated at 69 percent. Among the 
receipts from various tax sectors, the biggest portion has been 
estimated to come from income tax, value added tax, and land and 
building taxes. The three forms of taxes are the current and 
future major source tax incomes. As I stated earlier, we cannot 
be fully dependent on the gas and oil sector to provide us with 
total income. On the other hand, we have determined to be 
self-dependent in implementing our development. [passage omitted] 
  As I stated earlier, domestic income from the nongas sector 
also included receipts from net oil profit. These receipts are 
derived from the excess amount from the domestic sale of fuel 
based on the price of crude oil at U.S.$16 per barrel. In 
general, the national income from the gas and oil sector 
experienced a sharp decline due to the lower crude oil price. 
  Apart from domestic incomes, the estimated receipts from the 
development are set at 10 trillion rupiah. This figure 
represents the [word indistinct] from the liquidity of foreign 
aid, which we received from international organizations and from 
several countries. The amount is 4.8 percent more than the 
receipts from development in the existing budget. The 
relatively low increase indicates the lesser role of foreign aid 
in funding development. Allow me to further clarify the basic 
national expenditure, which are made up of routine and 
development expenditures. 
  Routine expenditure is estimated at 42.3 trillion rupiah, 
which means an increase of 14.2 percent over current 
expenditure. Of that amount, nearly half -- that is, 20.1 
trillion rupiah [words indistinct]. 
  The current national funds should be utilized for 
development. Because of this, the pay rise for civil servants 
and members of the Indonesian Armed Forces cannot yet be 
implemented. If the country's future situation warrants it, the 
government will definitely honor its obligation. Regarding the 
routine expenditure, it is estimated that the subsistence 
allowance for armed forces personnel will be increased from 
1,800 rupiah to 3,000 rupiah per day. 
  Honorable members, with domestic income totalling 50.9 
trillion and routine expenditure for administration totalling 
42.3 trillion rupiah, then the national savings in the 1994-95 
budget are estimated to be 17.4 trillion rupiah. This amount 
will be used to fund a large portion of the development 
allocation, which stands at 27.4 trillion rupiah. A balance of 
10 trillion rupiah is development expenditure in the form of 
[words indistinct] project aid. It is then clear that the 
portion from development expenditure has utilized more national 
savings. Besides, since the 1991-92 fiscal year, the amount 
subsidized by national savings has exceeded the subsidized 
amount from project aid. This means that we are becoming more 
self-reliant in funding our development. 
  Honorable members, I shall continue to clarify the broad 
guidelines on development expenditure. The amount for 
development expenditure is estimated at 27.4 trillion rupiah or 
an increase of 8.6 percent compared with the current budget. 
This is not a heavy increase. On the other hand, on entering 
the Sixth Five-Year Development Master Plan, the government will 
be given heavier responsibilities by parliament. [passage 
omitted] These are the priorities which should be given to the 
allocations for development: 
  1. To complete and continue all ongoing projects; 
  2. To fully utilize all the allocations for the 
implementation of projects; 
  3. To provide allocations tapped from the development 
expenditures for operational and management purposes; 
  4. To fund the development projects within the framework 
of trying to achieve the development objectives. [passage 
omitted] 
  All presidential funds will total just over 5.3 trillion 
rupiah. This will represent a 10-percent increase over the 
current fiscal year, generally because the scope of presidential 
programs will be expanded and particularly because a new 
presidential program for backward villages has been created. I 
presented to the House the main points of the new presidential 
program on 16 August. Every village categorized as being 
backward will be given 20 million rupiah unless it has already 
been taken care of under the current coordinated territorial 
development program. The total funds for the backward villages 
are estimated to amount to 389 billion rupiah. Beginning the 
first fiscal year of the Sixth 5-Year Development Plan, some 
presidential programs will be simplified by according greater 
responsibility to regions. This step shows our serious 
determination to develop regional autonomy more concretely, 
harmoniously, dynamically, and responsibly. Emphasis will be 
placed on second-level regions. This also shows our greater 
confidence in the ability of our development officials in the 
regions. Presidential funds for villages will be increased. 
Every village will get additional aid of 500,000 rupiah. Thus, 
every village will get six million rupiah in aid. Of this 
amount, one million will be used for family welfare development. 
The additional aid of 500,000 rupiah will be used primarily for 
village child and youth development. Thus, presidential funds 
for villages will total 423 billion rupiah or an increase of 8.5 
percent. Presidential programs for second-level regions will 
also be enhanced. More aid for these programs will be 
proportionate to their areas. 
  Beginning the next fiscal year, every second-level region 
will get additional aid on the basis of its area -- 20,000 
rupiah for every square kilometer. The additional aid is aimed 
at helping develop backward areas, which are generally remote 
due to their vastness and inaccessibility. Additional aid will 
also be given to second-level regions whose areas are made up of 
populated islands. This additional aid will be useful 
particularly for vast regions made up of islands in Eastern 
Indonesia. Based on these considerations, 2.4 trillion rupiah 
has been earmarked for presidential programs in second-level 
regions. This will represent an increase of some 135 percent 
over the current fiscal year. In the meantime, presidential 
funds for first-level regions will increase to 1.2 trillion 
rupiah, an increase of 55 percent over the current funds. There 
will be a slight increase in aid for first- level regions from 
56,000 rupiah to 60,000 for every square kilometer. Additional 
aid will also be earmarked for monitoring development projects 
in first-level regions. Thus, sectional and regional 
coordination will be enhanced in these regions. [passage omitted] 
  The second, third, and fifth biggest sectors in terms of 
fund 
allocations pertain to infrastructure. Transport is to receive 
over 5.2 trillion or 19 percent of the total development budget. 
Mining and energy is to get 3.5 trillion rupiah, most of which 
will be used to generate electricity. Almost 1.7 trillion 
rupiah will be for irrigation as the fifth largest sector. 
  Being the fourth biggest sector, education, national 
culture, 
religion, youth, and sports will receive some 3 trillion rupiah. 
About 97 percent of the amount will be used for education, 
including extracurricular education and official training 
programs. The amount has been greatly increased primarily to 
support a 9-year compulsory basic education program, which will 
begin in the next fiscal year. Similarly, religious education 
will also get a much bigger funding as part of the 9-year 
compulsory basic education program. 
  Only two other sectors will be allocated over 1 trillion 
rupiah each. Some 1.1 trillion and just over 1 trillion will be 
allocated to defense and security and health respectively. 
Health development will continue to get top priority as part of 
efforts to enhance the quality of human resources. Agriculture, 
which is currently under the combined sector of agriculture and 
irrigation, will receive 990 billion rupiah, while housing and 
settlement will get some 888 billion rupiah. 
  The fact that other sectors will not receive huge funds does 
not mean that they will receive less priority. They will 
receive the smaller funds because they have different needs to 
sectors which will need huge investment. The industrial sector, 
for example, will receive a relatively small development fund of 
450 billion rupiah, although industries will be an important 
sector during the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan. 
Essentially, industrial development is undertaken by the 
business circles, including state enterprises, while the 
government plays mainly a guiding or supervisory role and 
creates a healthy climate in which the industries can grow.

  [Text] The Philippine Government has lifted all forms of 
trade restrictions against South Africa, the Department of Trade 
and Industry announced yesterday. 
  Trade and Industry Undersecretary Tomas I. Alcantara said 
the 
resumption of trade ties with South Africa will jack up the 
exchange of trade between the two countries to $200 million this 
year from the existing cap of $50 million. 
  He added that Filipino businessmen can also use South Africa 
as an entry point for exports to central African countries, 
adding that Filipino exporters can already go into 
oleochemicals, garments, electronics, and software. 
  South Africa can then ship in its exports of steel, coal, 
phosphate rock, and capital equipment. 
  Moreover, the lifting of the trade embargo would also mean 
the flow of South African investments into the country, said Mr. 
Alcantara. [passage omitted]

  [Text] During a reception given in Hanoi to the 32-member 
U.S. Senate delegation led by Senator Johnston, Vietnamese party 
General Secretary Do Muoi wished that the U.S. make a further 
effort to improve the relations between the two countries. 
  Meanwhile, Senator Johnston said that the relations between 
the two countries have reached an important point and nowadays 
the U.S. should choose either normalize of relations or 
maintaining its sanction against Vietnam. He said the 
normalization of the U.S.-Vietnamese relations in economic and 
cultural fields will not only be in the interests of the two 
peoples but also influence world and regional peace and 
stability. 
  A press conference was held in Hanoi on Sunday afternoon by 
U.S. Senator Johnston and his party. Senator Johnston commented 
that the Vietnamese government and people have been cooperative 
in most of the ways, and the way of the world cooperation is not 
by punishment and the punishment ought to be stopped and start a 
new chapter [sentence as heard]. He said there is a tremendous 
vitality and energy in Vietnam. He hoped that his party and 
himself will make further efforts to consolidate and develop the 
cooperative relations between the two countries.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 10 KYODO -- North Korea has placed a 
sacked official of its governing Korean Workers Party in charge 
of U.S. affairs, informed Western sources in seoul said Monday 
[10 January]. 
  Kim Yong-sun, who was sacked as a candidate Politburo member 
in December, has been placed in charge of affairs with the 
United States, the sources said. 
  Kim met with U.S. Undersecretary of State Arnold Kanter in 
New York in January 1992 for the highest level contact ever 
between the two nations to discuss concerns arising from North 
Korea's suspected program to develop an atomic arsenal. 
  North Korea and the U.S. held two rounds of talks at the 
vice ministerial level last June and July aimed at resolving the 
impasse over international inspections of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear facilities. 
  Pyongyang has indicated a desire to upgrade the contacts 
after the third round meeting, which has not yet been held. 
  Kim, who has served in a number of foreign relations 
positions in the Workers Party and in the government over the 
years, was removed as a candidate Politburo member in a party 
reshuffle last month. 
  Meanwhile, the vice chairman for the party's section on 
reunification of the Korean peninsula, Kang Chu-il, was placed 
in charge of working-level affairs with South Korea, which had 
been directed by Kim, the sources said. 
  They expected little change in Pyongyang's South Korea 
policies in the wake of Kang's appointment. 
  With the recent political revival of Kim Yong-chu, the 
younger brother of North Korean President Kim Il-song, there 
have been reports that the younger Kim would have a special hand 
in South Korean affairs.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 9 (YONHAP) -- Visiting Japanese 
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata formally 
proposed to North Korea here on Sunday [9 January] that the two 
countries resume their normalization talks suspended since 
November 1992. 
  In a press conference at the end of his two-day visit to 
China, Hata said, "Japan hopes to resume the normalization talks 
at an early date." 
  The Japanese minister said that he discussed this offer 
during his meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, 
who he said welcomed it. 
  Western sources here said unofficial contacts had already 
begun between the Japanese and North Korean Embassies in Beijing 
on matters related to resuming the normalization talks. 
  They said Japan first expressed their willingness to resume 
the talks to the North Korean Embassy in Beijing toward the 
close of last year. 
  "The time of the resumption of the talks could possibly be 
either next month or March," one of the sources said. 
  Regarding the North Korean nuclear issues, Minister Hata 
said 
Japan and China agreed that the recent substantial progress in 
U.S.- North Korea contacts was a welcome development. 
  Hata added he believes North Korea would not resort to any 
careless acts inasmuch as their nuclear question is directly 
linked to peace and stability in the whole region of Northeast 
Asia let alone the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [By YOMIURI SHIMBUN correspondent Masaichi Nosaka] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 7 Jan -- Bowman Cutter, special 
assistant to the U.S. President for economic affairs, granted an 
exclusive interview to YOMIURI SHIMBUN on 6 June and commented 
on the current situation of the Japan-U.S. comprehensive trade 
talks, which are experiencing difficulties, saying: "We are 
pessimistic about the Japan-U.S. summit talks, slated to be held 
on 11 February, as to whether they will produce good results. 
We cannot have a Japan-U.S. summit that is satisfactory to us 
unless the Hosokawa administration works not only on the 
political reform but also on the economic issues as well." It 
is the first time for a senior White House official to explain 
severe prospects of the summit talks, which will be held about 
one month later. 
  Clearly denying the establishment of target figures in the 
microeconomy, against which Japan is keeping guard at the 
comprehensive trade talks, Cutter criticized Japan's negotiation 
stance, saying: "There is no such thing as target figures. The 
United States is asking for introduction of a standard which 
will be used to evaluate (expansion of market access)." 
Regarding reduction of Japan's trade surplus, on the other 
hand, Cutter pointed out: "Japan should aim to reduce it to a 
little less than 2 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP). 
We do not understand why it does not disclose its guideline." 
In this way, he explained his view that the Hosokawa 
administration should voluntarily disclose its trade surplus 
reduction plan. His comments indirectly explained his intention 
to produce some results at the framework talks by striking an 
agreement in the area of macro economy to find a way out of 
discussions, which are coming to a deadlock in the area of macro 
economy. 
  Regarding Japan's additional economic measures, Cutter said 
that "income tax reduction is the only way." At the same time, 
he doubted the effect of a package plan designed to reduce 
income tax and increase the consumption tax rate at the same 
time. He called for a large-scale tax reduction, saying that it 
should be reduced at "a scale that is large enough to promote 
economic growth." 
  On construction talks, he said: "There is a possibility of 
imposing sanctions against Japan. However, it is not desirable 
to do that." Regarding the issue of foreign semiconductor 
makers' market share in Japan, which dropped to below 20 
percent, Cutter criticized Japan which refuses to accept the 
USTR's call for holding emergency consultative talks.

<F P=106> [By reporter Hiroaki Ito] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 7 Jan -- Working-level meetings in 
Washington regarding government procurement of medical equipment 
in the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks ended on 7 January. 
Although some progress was made, such as making procurement 
procedures transparent, Japanese and U.S. officials remained at 
odds as they failed to fill the gap between their basic views 
concerning the issue of objective criteria. The procurement of 
medical equipment is one of the priority sectors in the 
bilateral trade talks. Dispute over this sector must be settled 
before the 11 February Japan-U.S. summit meeting. Therefore, 
negotiators plan to resume talks as early as after mid-January. 
  Concerning objective criteria, the United States demanded 
setting criteria to evaluate Japanese efforts "toward increasing 
imports to the level of other major industrialized nations." 
Japan, however, objected that "this idea would result in 
setting numerical targets." Thus, the two nations remained at 
odds, both refusing to compromise. 
  Working-level meetings regarding the government procurement 
sector in the bilateral trade talks have been held continuously 
since 4 January. A high-ranking U.S. trade official expressed 
strong dissatisfaction, saying: "Although an agreement was made 
during the summit meeting last July to set up numerical targets, 
Japan is now objecting to it. No progress has been made in the 
discussions because of Japan's attitude."

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 8 Jan 94 Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] The government has drafted an action program 
presenting plans on step-by-step opening of large public works 
projects to foreign companies beginning in April 1994 in order 
to reach a breakthrough in the Japan-U.S. construction talks, 
since the 20 January deadline for the U.S. Government making a 
decision on whether to take retaliatory measures against on 
Japan is soon approaching. 
  According to the draft program, details of which were 
revealed on 7 January, open competitive biddings will apply to 
central government projects worth more than 4.5 million SDR 
[special drawing rights] (about 700 million yen), and foreign 
companies will be granted rights equal to those granted to 
domestic companies in the biddings. Projects conducted by the 
metropolis, major cities and prefectures [todofuken] and 
designated cities [seirei shitei toshi] will be opened to 
foreign companies as well. In addition, companies' 
qualifications to participate in bidding will be set on the 
basis of objective assessments, and at least 40 days will be 
allowed from the time biddings are announced to the time they 
are conducted, so that foreign companies will have enough time 
to prepare for them. 
  The government wants to sound out the view of the United 
States on the action program in informal Japan-U.S. talks to 
open next week, and to have it approved by a cabinet meeting to 
be called on 18 January. 
  The action program calls for the opening of projects now 
under direct jurisdiction of the central government, as well as 
projects conducted by 84 government-related organizations, such 
as Japan Highway Public Corporation, East Japan Railway Company 
(JR East Japan) and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation 
(NTT). The central government will also request that 47 
governments -- including the metropolis, major cities and 
prefectures, and 14 designated cities -- open up their projects. 
  As far as the projects to be subject to open competition are 
concerned, the program applies to central government projects 
worth more than 4.5 million SDR and projects for local 
government and government-related organizations worth more than 
15 million SDR (about 2.5 billion yen). In the area of 
construction design, instead of the conventional bidding system, 
the program calls for adopting a system of publicly offered 
proposals, which would require bidding companies to propose 
technologies to be used. Design projects to be opened up are 
those worth more than 450,000 SDR (about 70 million yen) for 
government-related organizations and more than 1.5 million SDR 
(about 250 million yen) for local governments. Concerning local 
government projects, the United States demands that the 
applicable level of the projects' value be further lowered. 
Hence, the numbers are not yet definite. 
  The central government and government-related organizations 
will start to implement the action program as of the beginning 
of 1994 [April in the fiscal year] and will complete the 
implementation by March 1995. The schedule for implementation 
at the local government level is not given. 
  According to the new plan, construction companies that want 
to participate in the open competitive biddings need to achieve 
certain scores in the performance review process. This 
performance review will entail ratings in terms of six issues, 
such as net worth, years of operation, and number of engineers 
employed. Records of overseas performance will be taken into 
consideration so that foreign companies may not be 
disadvantaged. In the open competitive bidding system currently 
being used by the Construction Ministry, qualifications for 
participation are limited by a rating system based in part on 
subjective judgment. This will be completely replaced with a 
scoring system that is objective and internationally acceptable. 
  A minimum of 40 days will be given from the day of the 
bidding announcement to the day of actual conduct of the 
bidding. In making the announcements, the names of projects and 
the deadline for submission of bidding applications will be 
given not only in Japanese, but also in English. This action 
program is intended to apply to 24 nations -- including Japan, 
the United States, and European nations -- which are parties to 
the GATT's treaty on government procurement. 
  This action program has apparently taken many of the demands 
of the U.S. into account so far, but does not refer to the 
adoption of measuring indicators such as figures on the share of 
business won by foreign companies. 
  Japan is cautious about adopting measuring indicators which 
could end up as numerical targets. However, it is possible that 
the matter will become an issue in the [Japan-U.S.] talks next 
week.

  [Text] It seems that insurance services negotiations at 
the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, which will be held on 10 
and 11 January in Washington, will "soon come to a stage of 
seeking compromises" (according to a senior Finance Ministry 
official). There is not much time left for the negotiators 
because Japan-U.S. summit talks, which will complete the 
negotiations, will be held in less than one month. However, 
Japan's policy is to "make no concessions at all" in accepting 
U.S. demands, which may be linked to setting numerical standards 
or intervening in private companies' business affairs. 
Therefore, it seems that representatives of both countries will 
continue to have rough sailing at the negotiations. 
  The United States is calling for the following five points: 
1) rectify Japan's customary practice of doing business among 
companies related to each other through corporate affiliation; 
2) further liberalization of government-related insurance 
services to foreign companies; 3) securing transparency of 
government procedures for issuance of approvals or licenses for 
goods; 4) introduction of a broker system; and 5) shelving 
liberalization of the third sector [daisan bunya]. In addition, 
the United States also wants to adopt foreign insurance 
companies' rate of market share in Japan as a standard to 
measure the degree of market liberalization and to use such a 
standard in future negotiations. Among other things, Japan is 
asking the United States to unify supervisory regulations, which 
vary from state to state. 
  The Finance Ministry, which is in charge of promoting 
negotiations in the area of insurance services, thinks that many 
U.S. requests are consequences of insufficient understanding 
regarding insurance services because the United States Trade 
Representative, which represents the United States at the 
negotiations, is not an organization that is responsible for 
supervising insurance companies.

<F P=106> [Article by editorial staff member Hideo Tamura: "Confusion </F>
Continues In U.S.-Japan Framework Talks"] 
  [Text] The U.S.-Japan economic framework talks will reach a 
climax at the U.S.-Japan summit conference which is scheduled to 
be held on 11 February. Progress, however, has hardly been made 
in the ongoing U.S.-Japan negotiations on reduction of the 
Japanese current account surplus and on market opening in 
individual fields such as automobiles. The U.S. side is 
pursuing an excessively utilitarian goal and the Japanese side 
lacks a responsible world view. 
<H5>  Distrust of the Bureaucratic Structure </H5>
  For the United States, the U.S.-Japan economic framework 
talks constitute a framework through which the United States 
manages its confrontational economic relationship with Japan. 
The United States proposes the Japanese current account balance 
surplus be reduced by half in proportion to the gross domestic 
product. It also proposes introduction of a "market entry 
index" for individual markets, which include the market share 
for foreign enterprises in such areas as automobiles, auto 
parts, insurance, government procurement, and so forth. The 
purpose of such a target and of the introduction of indexes is 
to clearly elucidate "results." The United States believes that 
to bring about results, an automatic mechanism must be created 
and the United States must keep continuous surveillance over it. 
To maintain this surveillance, the United States believes that 
the indexes are necessary. 
  The U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement is a precedent for 
the 
framework talks. Because the goal of a 20-percent market share 
for foreign-manufactured [semiconductors] was achieved through 
the administrative guidance of the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry (MITI), the United States, both government 
and private sectors, praised it, saying: "It is the first case 
in which the Japanese side honored a U.S.-Japan agreement." 
  But Japan today refuses the U.S. demand entirely. MITI puts 
forth its position that "the semiconductor agreement was a very 
great mistake." One Japanese official spurned a high-ranking 
U.S. Government official who proposed establishment of market 
shares at the beginning of the framework talks, saying: "As for 
myself, your proposal is improper." This attitude has not 
changed since then. U.S. Government high-ranking officials, in 
turn, have been irritated ever since, saying: "Japanese 
officials can not be trusted." 
  There is also thinking on the U.S. side that the bureaucrats 
are interfering, even though Prime Minister Hosokawa advocates 
"change" for the Japanese economy. 
<H5>  Go Over the Heads of the Bureaucrats, Use Politicians </H5>
  An impatient U.S. negotiation team in December met with 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Representative Secretary Ichiro 
Ozawa, skipping over the heads of the bureaucrats. They are 
leaning toward the use of the directive power of "politics" over 
the bureaucrats. This reminds us of a revival of the method used 
by former Ambassador Armacost. He was called "Mr. Gaiatsu" by 
Kasumigaseki [government office district] because he went over 
to Nagata-cho [Tokyo political district] any time an issue arose 
and negotiated with influential Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
members. 
  But a solution is not necessarily found by going over the 
"wall" of the Japanese bureaucrats. As for quantitative 
indicators, should Japan create bilateral rules at a time when, 
as the new round is concluded, the rules are to be strengthened 
for multilateral free trade through GATT? As for imports, 
should Japan adopt methods of managed trade or conclude an 
agreement with the United States on voluntary import expansion, 
even as a temporary measure?... Such decisions concern 
fundamental issues of international trade policy and are outside 
the competence of individual politicians. 
  Bureaucratic organizations themselves are losing the basis 
of 
their power for domestic regulation. Just at that time [when 
the U.S. representatives were approaching the politicians], at 
MITI, [Masahisa] Naito, Industrial Policy Bureau director 
general, was driven to resignation. Naito had inherited the 
line of former Vice Minister Tanahashi. Tanahashi had expanded 
his authority through dealing with LDP legislators who 
represented trade and industry interests. The U.S. negotiation 
team had scheduled its meeting on that very day with Mr. Naito, 
hoping to find a break through for the issue. But the commotion 
over his resignation had already started, and the meeting was 
canceled. 
<H5>  Ambiguous Agreement Possible </H5>
  The management of trade which has depended on cooperation 
with powerful politicians, and leading industry with a heavy 
hand when dealing with U.S.-Japan friction has failed. The 
method of guidance such as calling the presidents of the 
automobile industry and making them buy U.S. products can not be 
carried out without the political back-up which can determine an 
industry's gain or loss. The U.S. side is at a loss because of 
the politicians' and bureaucrats' confusion. 
  Still, the framework talks will not break down. This is 
because, for high-ranking officials of both the United States 
and Japan, "non-agreement" will become proof of a "lack of 
ability" and a "lack of power." As for macroeconomic policy, 
the U.S. side formerly wanted a "10 trillion yen tax cut," but 
now is indicating a compromise of a "total of 10 trillion yen 
for a tax cut and public investment." But there is a great 
possibility that the vague agreement on quantitative indicators 
will accelerate differences of interpretation and intensify 
mutual distrust and confrontation. 
  Japan's continued accumulation of a surplus and refusal to 
accept foreign products and capital will disturb the world 
economy and accelerate the argument in the United States for 
retaliation against Japan. The basic thinking of the United 
States, which proposed the framework talks, is that, under such 
circumstances, the post-cold war U.S.-Japan relationship in 
which concern will be focused on economic interests cannot be 
maintained. They one-sidedly seek a change in Japanese policy. 
The current confusion stems from the fact that Japanese side 
could not indicate a clear counter plan to deal with such 
thinking and has merely continued to respond to the other side's 
language. What is sought from the Hosokawa government is 
finding a stable axis for the U.S.-Japan relationship.

<F P=106> [By Shigeru Komago in Washington; from the "Undercurrent" </F>
column] 
  [Text] The U.S. Government has adopted a more realistic 
attitude toward Japan. This was because of advice from U.S. 
Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale. According to a number of 
senior U.S. officials, Mondale, through his contacts with U.S. 
Government officials visiting Japan, and correspondences by 
telephone or telegram, has persistently stressed that "we must 
make the Japan- U.S. summit meeting in February a success in 
consideration of the difficulties facing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa." The former vice president's judgment about the 
situation may have reminded the Clinton administration, however 
briefly, of the story of "The North Wind and the Sun" in Aesop's 
fables. 
  The Clinton administration's demands on Japan have become 
much more acceptable to Japan, compared to its previous 
position, since mid-December. Comments on the issue of the 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks can be taken as a softening 
of the U.S. position, including the suggestion that "we will not 
seek market share targets," and the remark "we would like to 
reach agreement only on guiding Japan to open its market to a 
degree comparable to other advanced nations." 
  Even in the area of macroeconomic policy, the United States 
has refrained from making concrete demands, claiming "we are not 
in a position to talk about the precise scale and schedule of 
the income tax cut in Japan." And on the matter of the yen 
exchange rate, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen went beyond an 
acceptance of the present exchange rate to make remarks which 
could be taken to mean a toleration of a further depreciation of 
the yen against the dollar. 
  This change came after Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger 
Altman 
visited Japan in mid-December. Senior U.S. Government officials 
not only exchanged views with Japanese officials, but were also 
briefed by Mondale on the economic and political situation in 
Japan, and given the advice that "it will not do to be on the 
offensive all the time." 
  In other words, "the sun will be more effective than the 
north wind in making Japan, which is wrapped in warm clothing, 
disrobe, or open its markets and expand domestic demand." 
  Since then, the U.S. Government has not publicly made any 
unreasonable demands regarding Japanese economic stimulation 
measures, and has temporarily toned down its unacceptable 
demands at the framework talks. 
  Admittedly, U.S. officials in charge of the talks are also 
anxious because "our performance will be assessed on the outcome 
of the framework talks." The Clinton administration has made 
"three consecutive hits" in trade policy with the ratification 
of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Asian 
Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (APEC), and the GATT 
multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round). U.S. Trade 
Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor is eager to "make a `cycle 
hit' [a Japanese-coined baseball term referring to the same 
player making a single-base hit, a two-base hit, a three-base 
hit, and a home run in one single game] by concluding the 
framework talks successfully." However, it will reflect poorly 
on the officials concerned if there is no agreement reached in 
February. 
  It now remains to be seen how the Japanese Government will 
take advantage of the realistic line adopted by the United 
States, which has been the combined result of the advice from 
the former U.S. vice president and the desire of U.S. officials 
to put on a good performance.

<F P=106> [By reporter Hiroaki Ito] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 21 Dec -- On the question of setting 
numerical targets -- a focal issue in the new Japan-U.S. 
economic talks -- the United States' attitude has apparently 
softened. For instance, Secretary of State Spallow [name, title 
as published] formally announced on 21 January that the United 
States is "not asking to set targets for market shares (of 
foreign products)." This may be interpreted as a move to probe 
for a point to bring the talks to a conclusion. Several factors 
may have contributed to the change in the U.S. Government's 
attitude -- such as U.S. President Clinton's unswerving economic 
policy of "giving priority to getting results even at the cost 
of making concessions," and his consideration for Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, who is in a difficult position over such 
issues as political reform. 
  The economic talks started with a not-too-clear agreement on 
"setting objective criteria to measure progress of market 
liberalization" at the Japan-U.S. summit in July. In the course 
of the talks, Charlene Barshevsky, deputy U.S. trade 
representative (USTR), demanded that Japan "improve the market 
shares of foreign products to the level practiced in the seven 
major industrial nations (G-7) within a few years. Japan 
reacted negatively toward the demand, insisting that "setting 
numerical targets goes against Japan-U.S. agreements." 
  In attempting to understand the reason for the U.S. 
softening 
its attitude, a parliamentarian concerned said: "Making 
concessions, striving for substance rather than agreements in 
name only, is the usual routine of the Clinton economic policy." 
Concerning the rice issue, the United States abandoned its 
stand on "tariffication without exception" but succeeded in 
drawing concessions from Japan by presenting a compromise to it 
in the form of a "special measure." Consequently, it succeeded 
in securing for itself the "substance" of assured participation 
in the Japanese rice market and stepped-up liberalization of 
beef and citrus products markets. 
  A senior USTR official said: "Judgments on whether Japan has 
made progress in opening up its market will be reached by taking 
into account several factors in a comprehensive manner -- not by 
whether or not certain numerical targets have been reached." 
However, he also added: "If there are gaps in judgment between 
Japan and the United States, the United States will take action 
based on its own judgment." In other words, the United States 
can decide to put the U.S. Trade Act into motion, depending on 
its judgment. This would mean that "the United States could 
compromise on the question of numerical targets, but there is no 
change in the effect of putting pressure on Japan." 
  Another factor is the consideration given for the difficult 
position Prime Minister Hosokawa is now facing. Bowman Cutter, 
deputy assistant to the President, is said to have spent much 
time when he was in Japan recently gathering information 
relating to the future of the Hosokawa government. In the White 
House, there are many who view positively the market 
liberalization and deregulation policies advocated by Prime 
Minister Hosokawa -- regardless of whether he has real power or 
not. 
  In a news conference on 20 December, Mickey Kantor, U.S. 
trade representative, made a remark supporting the prime 
minister in an indirect way, saying bureaucrats should be 
sensitive to what the prime minister seeks to achieve. 
Undersecretary of State Spallow [name, title as published] has 
also viewed Prime Minister Hosokawa's policies in a positive 
light. The official's concern was apparent when he said: "It is 
not good to press Prime Minister Hosokawa, who is in a difficult 
position over the issues of budget formulation and political 
reform bills." 
  Another point to note is that there has been a gap of views 
between the Office of the USTR on one hand and the White House 
and the Department of State on the other from the beginning. 
Under Secretary of State Spallow has said, "the United States 
has never talked about numerical targets," and White House 
officials have also been conspicuously cautious. But people 
like Barshevsky, deputy U.S. trade representative, have demanded 
setting the numerical targets, going so far as to assert, for 
instance, that "Japanese bureaucrats function better when they 
have concrete targets." 
  It is highly possible that the United States is employing in 
the economic talks the strategy of Trade Representative Kantor, 
who was a lawyer formerly, of "making as many demands as 
possible in the beginning, and then conducting negotiations on 
them later." 
  However, while attitudes may have changed superficially, it 
does not mean that the Clinton government has given up its 
intention of including in the agreement figures of market shares 
held by foreign products of companies from the G-7 nations. The 
White House has suggested that "standard G-7 market share 
figures should be included."

<F P=106> [By Shigeru Komago] </F>
  [Text] Washington, 24 Dec -- There has been increasing 
criticism of Japanese bureaucrats from senior U.S. Government 
officials. While this is seen to be due to impatience with the 
deadlock in Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, it is also 
believed that statements by Japanese bureaucrats portraying the 
recent change in the U.S. position as "a concession to Japan" 
have enraged the U.S. officials. Such a war of words "does more 
harm than good" to the framework talks. Industry leaders in 
both countries are annoyed that "bureaucratic friction has 
surpassed actual Japan-U.S. economic friction in intensity; this 
is aggravating the problem." 
  Recently, U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor and 
Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president (concurrently 
vice chairman of the National Economic Council), criticized 
Japanese bureaucrats in public, mainly for: 1) distorting U.S. 
proposals in the framework talks when presenting them to 
Japanese Government leaders and the Japanese people, and 
creating a "mistaken impression"; and 2) stopping the Japanese 
political and industrial sectors from taking steps to open 
markets, ease regulations, and reduce income tax. 
  Senior U.S. officials are particularly annoyed that the 
Japanese counterargument which claims "the United States is 
obsessed with market share targets, and is forcing managed trade 
on Japan" has received international support, and has even given 
rise to criticism of the government in the United States. In 
any case, the Japanese argument is not entirely a distortion of 
facts. 
  In the beginning, the Clinton administration had indeed made 
repeated statements which showed a preoccupation with market 
share targets. It is only in the past month, when reaching an 
agreement in the framework talks before the Japan-U.S. summit 
meeting in February has become the priority task, that remarks 
to the effect that "we are not obsessed about market share 
targets" became prominent. 
  The truth is, the U.S. Government is extremely anxious that 
this recent shift of position may be taken as "a concession to 
Japan," and subjected to criticism in Congress. That is the 
reason why U.S. officials have criticized Japanese bureaucrats 
in public despite the possible adverse effects on the framework 
talks.

  [Text] At a news conference held by the Japan Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry [JCCI] on 6 January, JCCI president Kosaku 
Inaba, and Norio Oga, vice president of the Tokyo Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry [TCCI] (president of Sony Corporation), 
said: "We wonder if Treasury Secretary Bentsen is trying to 
increase his country's trade deficit," thus indicating strong 
reaction against remarks by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, who 
said: "Allowing the yen to slide is not acceptable." They 
added, "Japan has to say what it has to say to the United 
States." 
  Such criticism was touched off by TCCI Vice President Oga, 
who said: "I was surprised at hearing Bentsen's remarks because 
the U.S. economy is improving." He added: "The United States' 
computer industry is one of the driving forces of its economy, 
but such computer parts as liquid crystal displays [LCDs] are 
all Japanese made. Unless industries producing such computer 
parts are established in the United States it has to continue to 
import them from Japan, and therefore its trade deficit with 
Japan will continue to increase if the yen continues to rise. 
The Japanese Government should make the United States 
understand this." He indicated that, not only for Japan but 
also for the U.S. economy, the yen's appropriate rate against 
the dollar is 120. 
  JCCI President Inaba said: "The United States is an 
importing country. Its attempt to raise exports by making use 
of the appreciated yen is merely a partial effort." He 
stressed: "Japan, in its past relations with the United States, 
weakly threw back the ball cast by the United States. From now 
on, we have to cast back the ball properly." 
  This indicates the verbal intervention into the yen's 
exchange rate by the U.S. high-raking official has irritated the 
industry leaders who seem to be nervous about the U.S. 
Government's move because Japan is still in a serious depression.

<F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 7 Jan 94 </F>
Morning Edition] 
  [Text] The working group meeting on government procurement 
in the telecommunications sector held in Washington on 4 and 5 
January closed without making any significant progress. While 
there has been some progress on the issue of improving the 
transparency of the bidding procedures, Japan rejected the U.S. 
proposal to include Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation 
(NTT) in the agreement on government procurement, and the two 
sides have not been able to close the gap on the issue of 
objective criteria. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will be meeting President 
Bill Clinton for the third time at the summit talks on 11 
February. The Clinton administration seems to have refrained 
from making tough demands on Japan so far "for fear of hurting 
the Hosokawa administration." However, the present government 
has been in existence for six months, and the prime minister's 
close aides believe that "this time, they will be asking for 
results." The government is, thus, hoping that some progress 
can be made in the framework talks, which is the focal issue at 
present. 
  According to one government source, however, "the point of 
compromise remains unclear," and more rough sailing is expected 
in the talks. 
  As far as Hosokawa is concerned, he has no choice but to 
push 
for "political reform first," even though he also faces the need 
to adopt pump-priming measures and pass the budget, not to 
mention his visit to the U.S. In contrast to Clinton, who will 
be well- prepared, Hosokawa cannot claim to have fully prepared 
a well-thought-out strategy for the U.S. summit meeting. 
  At the framework talks, government procurement, insurance, 
and automobiles and auto parts have been named as priority 
areas, and both sides expect to reach agreement before the 
summit meeting in February. After the negotiations on 
telecommunications, the working group on government procurement 
of medical equipment is holding meetings on 6 and 7 January, the 
working group on insurance on 10 and 11 January, and deputy 
ministerial level discussions on automobiles and auto parts are 
due to start on 11 January, leading up to the critical 
negotiating phase in February. 
  According to the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry, objective criteria still represent a controversial 
issue because "they might lead to managed trade." The United 
States would like to introduce such things as future sales 
volume as numerical targets, while Japan is strongly opposed to 
the idea. Recently, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative, the United States has taken the more flexible 
position of "not seeking the setting of numerical targets." 
Japan, however, remains unconvinced. It believes "the United 
States is still asking for an increase in our purchase of 
U.S.-made automobiles and auto parts; this will still lead to 
numerical targets." 
  Furthermore, in government procurement and insurance, the 
United States is seeking to measure the degree of openness of 
the Japanese market by comparing the share of foreign products 
and companies on it to those in the other G-7 nations. 
According to the Foreign Ministry, Japan maintains it will "not 
agree to any targets," on this issue either. 
  However, since Japan has been unable to come up with any 
effective measures to reduce its current accounts surplus, some 
government officials believe "Japan will have to make some sort 
of concession." In the end, Hosokawa may have to make a 
political decision overriding the wishes of the bureaucrats.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 7 Jan 94 Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Regarding the question of liberalizing the cellular 
phone market -- an issue of concern to Japan and the United 
States -- the government has confirmed the position that it will 
not take any new administrative measures to promote 
participation of U.S.-model products in the Japanese market. 
The government is expected to formally notify the United States 
of this position in an urgent vice-ministerial-level meeting it 
has called to hold in Washington early next week. The United 
States has called on Japan to open up its cellular market 
further, by setting 15 February as the date by which it will 
decide whether to take retaliatory measures, but Japan is poised 
to maintain the position of insisting "this is an issue which 
should be resolved by the private sector." 
  With the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks going into 
full- 
scale negotiations soon, the government hopes the confirmation 
of this basic stance can remind the United States on the 
principle of the economic talks that "measures should be limited 
to those which the hands of government can reach." Meanwhile, 
most likely, the United States will insist that measures should 
be instituted at the government level. The issue of cellular 
phones is not a topic of discussion at the economic framework 
talks. However, this issue is likely to loom large when trying 
to predict what will happen to the framework talks henceforth. 
  A Japan-U.S. vice-ministerial-level meeting on cellular 
phones has been requested by Japan, and negotiations are now 
underway toward holding it on 10 or 11 January. Masahito Tani, 
deputy vice-minister of posts and telecommunications, and 
Charlene Barshevsky, vice U.S. trade representative, are 
expected to attend the meeting, representing Japan and the 
United States, respectively. 
  In December, the U.S. Government announced that it was 
moving 
up the deadline for deciding on retaliatory measures from the 
end of March to 15 February 1994, on the grounds that the 
adoption of Motorola systems in the Japanese market is lagging 
as compared to that of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) 
systems. The United States appears to be wanting to extract 
concessions from Japan by associating this issue with the 
economic framework talks which Japan and the United States want 
to conclude in a summit on 11 February. 
  Japan insists, "The Motorola systems have been used in the 
metropolitan area and the central region since 1989. Enough 
frequencies have been assigned to them already." A source in 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "There is nothing more 
that can be done at the government level." In the 
vice-ministerial-level meeting expected to be held early next 
week, Japan will ask the United States why it has moved up the 
deadline for deciding on retaliatory measures, and will make 
clear its position that "whether or not the Motorola systems 
should be adopted is a question to be dealt with at the 
private-sector level."

  [Text] China is becoming a leading player in the world 
economy. The real economic scale of the "great China sphere," 
encompassing Hong Kong and Taiwan, will probably exceed that of 
Japan and even the United States in the 21st century. 
Economically depressed advanced countries are queuing up to 
converge on China with its huge potential market of 1.2 billion 
persons. Japanese enterprises might miss the opportunity for 
growth if they are late in starting. China is swaying the world. 
<H3>  Restraining Measures Ineffective--Even Universities Enter 
Joint Ventures </H3>
  To prevent economic overheating, the Chinese Government set 
forth in May 1993 a policy to not only control establishment of 
development zones in regions but to strictly examine the 
soundness of project plans and fund procurement of development 
zones below the county level and, in some cases, to abolish 
them. However, it appears that local entities are ignoring the 
government policy. 
  Presently, Songjiang County, adjoining Shanghai, is becoming 
the focal point of foreign capital attracted to China. Land 
prices (usage rights) in Shanghai City have risen considerably, 
but are still cheap. Moreover, the expressway linking Shanghai 
and Hangzhou City, which is under construction by the nation, 
will pass through this county. Tahui "xiang" (equivalent to a 
town), located about 10 km west of the center with the county 
offices, is a typical farming village with vast paddy fields 
seen in the outskirts of Shanghai. At present, this town is 
trying desperately to sell its development zone. The area of the 
development zone is 2,700 mu (1 mu is 666 square meters), or 
approximately 15 percent of the town's agricultural land. A 
20-meter road was built in the middle of the paddy fields and 
land on both sides is being sold. 
<H3>  "Local Countermeasures to Central Government 
Policies"--Expediency Measures Increase as Restraints Are 
Tightened </H3>
  The population of this town is 17,000. Since it is close to 
Shanghai, there are many branch factories of state-owned 
enterprises and 63 of them are in this town. It is a 
"semi-agricultural, semi-manufacturing" town with factories now 
contributing more than 50 percent of the town's total output of 
400 million yuan (approximately 7.4 billion yen). To further 
increase cash revenue, the buildup of the development zone is 
being promoted. 
  As its name implies, this town has old pagodas built during 
the Tang dynasty and a Taiwanese enterprise is now engaged in a 
development project with total investment of 40 million yuan 
(approximately 740 million yen) to build a comprehensive resort 
area with golf courses and hotels. Chen Jinrong, secretary of 
the CPC Tahui Town Committee, says, "Even if the present 
development zone is completely sold out, there are other sites 
we can offer. We would greatly welcome the entry of Japanese 
enterprises." 
  Xinping Town, located about an hour's ride west of Tahui, 
has 
converted 10,000 mu of agricultural land into a development zone 
and started a full-scale program to attract foreign capital. 
With a population of 33,000 persons and an area of 45,000 mu, 
this town is the largest in Songjiang County but relatively few 
factories have entered because of difficult accessibility. Even 
today, it takes over two hours from Shanghai but, as early as 
next spring, the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway might open and an 
interchange will be built nearby, so, using the claim, "only 35 
minutes to Shanghai" (Wang Yougen, town mayor), as the selling 
point, efforts to attract foreign capital were started in 
earnest. The mayor says, "If the contract is concluded this 
year, we will sell you 1 square meter for $30.00." 
  Of course, Songjiang County, which administers these towns, 
is operating its own development zone. In July 1992, 
agricultural land was converted and an "Eastern Economic 
Development Zone" was newly established. The size is 30,000 mu, 
equivalent to about 30 percent of the county area, and 160 
million yuan (approximately 2.9 billion yen) were spent on 
infrastructure buildup, including roads, electricity, water 
supply, etc. 
  So far, the entry of 40 companies from 11 countries is 
certain. Among them are eight Japanese companies, including 
Yakult and Toyo Denso Co. (Minato-ku, Tokyo), an automobile 
parts manufacturer affiliated with Honda Motor Co. 
  Wang Min, deputy director of CPC Songjiang County Propaganda 
Department, nonchalantly makes a comment that would surprise 
Pudong officials: "If you are planning to enter national-level 
development zones, such as Shanghai's Pudong area, you have to 
go to Beijing to obtain permits each time and the procedure is 
cumbersome. You can enter easily here and the prices are less 
than half of other places. We are very anxious for Japanese 
enterprises to come." 
  Actually, land prices (50-year usage rights) are $40-$50 per 
square meter, including infrastructure expenses, so the level is 
less than half of that in Shanghai's Pudong area or Shenzhen 
City. 
  Taking the case of Songjiang County alone, most of the 
county's 19 towns and villages have established development 
zones and are competing for foreign capital. 
  Furthermore, the inducement methods might be called 
versatile. Recently, an increasing number of Japanese firms have 
been contemplating entries into local development zones, seeking 
low-priced lands, but the Chinese business methods are 
complicating their decisions. 
  A certain town is encouraging investments through a type of 
expediency measure, i.e., "to make it a joint venture in form 
only; in reality, independent financing (full capital 
subscription) is acceptable." As compared with independent 
financing, a joint venture has many advantages, such as lenient 
export requirements, payment of subscription in installments, 
etc. 
  On the other hand, through independent financing, foreign 
capital enterprises can freely conduct business operations as 
they wish. In other words, the towns are encouraging the clever 
method of having the towns formally register the incoming 
foreign capital as a joint venture and do all the required 
paperwork until the factory opens, but, in reality, permit free 
operation through independent financing. 
  Also, leaders of other towns say, "There is government 
guidance, but we can make arrangements for prices and methods of 
establishing companies without regard to it." If factories are 
built, cash revenue can be readily earned as compared with 
farming, which is burdened with extremely low purchase prices 
for crops. Once the benefits of factory management are enjoyed, 
it becomes difficult to backtrack. 
  As revealed in the statement, "there are local 
countermeasures against central government policies," local 
actions are difficult to restrain. As control measures become 
tighter, expedient methods, which have a stronger element of 
"human politics" than legal rule, become more active. This 
technique is very difficult for Japanese firms to understand. 
  Onoda Cement Co. established the Dalian Huaneng-Onoda Cement 
Co., Ltd., in Dalian City, Liaoning Province, as a joint venture 
with a local enterprise. Dalian Onoda started full-scale 
production of cement in July 1992, but the company has been 
concerned recently about pressure being applied to maintain 
product prices at a certain level though there is no such legal 
provision. 
  Production capacity of the company's plant is China's 
largest 
at 1.37 million tons per year. Investments totaling 26 billion 
yen are among the largest of Japanese firms. 
  At present, approximately 60 percent of the output is 
exported to the United States. The export ratio set when the 
contract was drawn was 70 percent but, because "demand for 
high-quality cement became urgent with the construction boom in 
China and domestic shipments were increased sharply" (So Kojima, 
general manger), the level below the quota is being permitted. 
  That is not a problem, but Dalian Onoda's headache is the 
administrative guidance for minimum export prices from Dalian 
City. 
  There are other state-operated cement manufacturers in 
Dalian 
City. If Onoda exports too cheaply, the sales of state 
enterprises might decline, so the minimum price instruction was 
issued that "shipments below this price are not permitted." 
  For the present, sales are somehow being made, but 
competitive power will be lost eventually if prices remain high. 
There is also fear that the minimum price might be raised in the 
future. There is no legal basis, but if not obeyed, export 
permits will be suspended, so the company must comply. 
  Increase in materiel costs, without consultation, is another 
source of concern. There was an occasion when the fees for 
electricity provided by the city were raised sharply by over 20 
percent, without advance notice, and calculation of 
manufacturing costs was thrown off badly. There was an upsetting 
experience, too, when the water supply was cut off abruptly. 
<H3>  "Inability To Estimate" Plant Construction 
Costs--Japaneses-Style Feasibility Studies Are Useless </H3>
  Also, even with plant constructions, there were problems 
that 
could not be imagined in Japan. Construction costs could not be 
estimated accurately and were inflated substantially. 
  In China, there are no business practices like the full 
turnkey contract, whereby a plant is constructed at a set cost 
and turned over to the owner. For this reason, construction had 
to be started without detailed plans. Through discussions with 
individual state and private sector officials, after 
construction was started, construction costs finally become 
known. In Onoda's case, investments exceeded the budgeted amount 
by over 20 percent. 
  Honda Motor Co., too, was troubled by the "inability to 
estimate." In July 1993, as a joint venture with the state-owned 
munitions manufacturer, China Jialing Industrial Co., Ltd., 
Honda established the Jialing-Honda Motor Co., a two-wheeled 
vehicle manufacturing firm, in Chongqing City, Sichuan Province. 
  In Chongqing Economic and Technological Development Zone, 
located in Nanping on the south bank of the Yangzi River, 
construction began this June on a plant with production capacity 
of 300,000 vehicles a year. 
  The first problem that arose was the financing of the costs 
to prepare the site. There were a hill, 10 meters high, and four 
lakes at the site. 
  According to the land-use contract, preparatory costs were 
to 
be borne by the city's development zone, but costs doubled 
because work did not proceed smoothly and the development zone 
ran out of money. Since there was no way out, Jialing-Honda had 
to cover the deficiency. 
  Even with the electric supply contract with the power 
generation bureau, the contracted rate had been 460 yuan per 
kilovolt-ampere (kv-amp) but the rate actually jumped to 760 
yuan. In the case of Jialing-Honda, usage is to 10,000 kv-amp so 
the increase meant an additional charge of approximately 55 
million yen. Yuji Yamahata, director and manufacturing division 
chief, says resignedly: "It seems the rate was raised because 
they had to install a new large-capacity transformer. We are 
building the plant with the spirit of cooperation to build the 
infrastructure of the development zone." 
  Marubeni Corp.'s Beijing branch is worried about the 
unexpected jump in rental rates of foreigner-use apartments 
which are occupied by its resident employees. 
  Rates increased by about 35 percent over last year to $35-40 
per square meter a month. Since an apartment is about 100 square 
meters because of larger floor space for foreigners, the monthly 
rent is approximately $4,000. Converted to Japanese yen, that 
exceeds 400,000 yen. 
  Until early 1992, there was a renter's market for 
foreigner-use apartments and rents were declining. Subsequently, 
however, as the number of resident employees increased with the 
steady advance of foreign capital, demand exceeded supply and 
rates began to rise. 
  When unforeseen events occur, the Japanese-style feasibility 
study (FS/corporate research) is not useful. 
  Akira Sera, senior director of Nisshin Oil Mills, which 
started to operate a joint-venture oil plant in September 1990 
in Dalian, states that "a thorough FS was conducted over five 
years but it was not very useful." 
  During the FS stage, edible oil was rationed and supply 
continued to be limited in China but, after the plant started to 
operate, large quantities of imports from other countries, 
including the United States, began to flow in with 
liberalization of sales, and selling prices fell. Moreover, raw 
material prices soared because of inflation and profits could 
not be earned for a while. 
  Situations might also arise where counterparts, which cannot 
be imagined in Japan, become candidates in a joint venture. 
  Located along the middle reaches of the Yangzi River is the 
city of Wuhan of Hubei Province. Japanese firms investing in the 
joint Japan-China software development company, Wuhan Anluo 
Computer Systems, Ltd., which has its main offices in this city, 
are software development subsidiaries, Yaskawa Information 
Systems (Kita-Kyushu City) and Y.E. Data, of Yaskawa Electric 
Manufacturing Co. The Chinese subscriber is Wuhan Dongluo New 
Technology Research Institute but it is the Wuhan University 
which is providing the capital in full. It is under the direct 
jurisdiction of the State Education Commission of the State 
Council and an important university in which only the top 
performers in entrance exams can enter. 
  It is inconceivable for a national university in Japan to 
establish enterprises but it is a government policy in China. 
Various departments in Wuhan University have started businesses 
and at present, the number has reached over 20 companies. Of 
them, five are joint ventures with foreign firms. 
  Zhang Yumin, general manager of Wuhan Anluo, also serves as 
an assistant professor in Wuhan University's computer science 
program (equivalent to a department). It would the same as if, 
in Japan, an assistant professor of a famous national 
university, supposedly far removed from businesses, were to take 
on the dual role of running a foreign capital-affiliated 
enterprise. Business profits are used to supplement shortages of 
academic departments and are also distributed among professors. 
At the most, there is nearly a threefold differfential in pay 
among departments. 
  The biggest earner is the university's economic institute. 
Trainees are accepted from state and city governments as well as 
stock brockerages and insurance companies and lectures are given 
on market economy. In other words, a "Chinese-style business 
school" is being operated. In addition to running the joint 
venture, the computer science department, too, is teaching 
computer technologies to approximately 100 trainees from outside 
the school. The professors' salaries rank fifth among the 
university's 33 departments. 
  The method of raising capital is also unique. Of the capital 
subscription of $100,000, Wuhan University invested $45,000. For 
this investment, funds were allocated to build a departmental 
research institute. Shi Quangchao, assistant general manager and 
Wuhan University lecturer, explains the reason for the budget 
transfer as follows: "The technological level can be elevated 
faster by receiving the newest technology from foreign companies 
in a joint venture than by building a research institute and 
exchanging technologies with foreign universities. Moreover, 
profits can be expected." 
  In Chinese corporations which are growing rapidly, there are 
many customs and systems that are beyond the comprehension and 
commonsense of Japanese corporations. 
  Business operations are carried out without strict adherence 
to laws and regulations and in such cases, personal contacts 
play an important part. 
  These Chinese business practices appear to present big risks 
to Japanese companies. If one has to say, "we cannot know the 
costs until we try," he probably cannot even bring the subject 
up at a board meeting in Japan. 
<H3>  Inadequate Land-Air Routes and Communications 
Facilities--Infrastructure Problem Poses an Obstacle </H3>
  The infrastructure problem is another big risk concern of 
Japanese corporations. 
  Yukio Seki, chief researcher and head of Asia Research 
Office, Economic Research Division, Nomura Research Institute, 
points out: "Production in mining and manufacturing industries 
is increasing at a double-digit annual rate but the railroad 
transportation capacity is growing at only about 3 percent. At 
this rate, economic growth will be constrained." The fact is 
that "railway freight transport in 1992 was able to meet only 
about 60 percent of demand" (Tadao Nishi, head of Research and 
Publications Division, Association for the Promotion of 
International Trade, Japan). 
  When employees of Yamaha Motor Co.'s joint company in 
Chongqing leave by plane on domestic business trips, they depart 
without setting an anticipated return date. Fumiaki Kamiya, 
administrative department chief of the joint company, states 
matter-of-factly: "Passenger aircraft are always filled and only 
tickets for outgoing trips can be obtained in Chongqing. 
Employees must remain at their destinations until they can make 
reservations for the return trips, so I send them out thinking 
they should return in 10 days." 
  Road conditions are not good, either. The main highways 
leading out from big cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and 
Chongqing, are heavily congested all the time. Trucks and busses 
fill the roads and there is constant honking of horns. It seems 
as though there are no traffic regulations. There is a steady 
stream of cars rushing by at high speeds. Pedestrians and 
bicyles weave through them. 
  In fact, when a trip was made to a plant in the suburbs 
about 
30 km from Chongqing, an allowance of two to three hours had to 
be made one way. En route, a truck that had broken down was 
abandoned in the middle of the road. There was an occasion when 
we were stalled for nearly two hours in a traffic jam. Car 
performances are still unpredictable and vehicles that overheat 
or that do not restart worsen the congestion. For a simple 
business transaction in the suburbs, one or two days are wasted 
in getting around. 
  Communications facilities are poor, too. Even in big cities, 
during the company's business hours, telephone calls jam the few 
circuits and long-distance calls are difficult to make. 
Construction of relay facilities is moving slowly and portable 
telephones are often not serviceable. 
  In Wuhan, power outages occur almost daily in the summer 
when 
air conditioners are turned on all at once during the day and in 
the evenings when meal preparations begin. NEC Corp.'s joint 
company, Wuhan-NEC Optical Communications Co., Ltd. (Wuhan 
City), will prepare for outages by installing its own generator 
in the optical communications equipment plant being built with a 
March 1994 completion target date. 
  Deficiencies are also noticeable in the legal system. Kenji 
Hattori, chief of Information and Research Section, Japan-China 
Association on Economy and Trade, states: "There are criminal 
laws and criminal litigation laws but there are no systematic 
codes of civil and commerlcial laws which serve as the legal 
basis for corporate activities. The legal system is a big 
problem, too." 
  The Japan-China Investment Promotion Agency, which has 
expertise in handling problems related to investments in China, 
recommends that time be spent on negotiations before concluding 
contracts, draw up detailed contract agreements and do not carry 
over matters to post-contract negotiations. After contracts are 
concluded, it is also necessary to check whether all of the 
contractual items are being carried out faithfully. 
<H3>  Only Risks Stand Out, But There Is No Other Growth Market 
Like China </H3>
  Masanada Hirano, assistant secretariat chief of the above 
agency, advises that: "To conduct business smoothly in China, it 
is important to wine and dine persons in key positions. Japanese 
companies should understand this and should not be stingy with 
social expenses." In China, where prices are cheap as compared 
with Japan, the social expenses of a certain Japanese general 
manager soared to 3 million yen in one year. 
  However, if attention is paid only to risks, another aspect 
of China will be overlooked. 
  Izumi Hara, chief of the Project Development Section, China 
Committee, Industrial Bank of Japan, makes this statement: "The 
aim of the recent economic tightening is to stop inflationary 
practices such as land speculation. In essence, the entire 
economy will not be stalled because of this move. There is no 
other developing country with as abundant manpower as China and 
also, there is no other economy with so much waste. If the 
manpower is used and waste is eliminated, there is limitless 
room for growth." 
  The economic environment differs greatly from the time of 
the 
Tiananmen incident in 1989. Consumer goods are plentiful and 
there is no panic-buying of goods as happened then, while the 
harvest last year was rich enough to record record crop 
production. 
  The move to restrain overheating, led by Vice Premier Zhu 
Rongji, Deng Xiaoping's protege, is achieving results: "Before 
August, one-third of the loans by financial institutions to 
companies had been recovered" (a senior official of the State 
Council). At the least, money is no longer available for 
speculative real estate investments. 
  It is true that there is great risk in the Chinese market. 
Political aberrations occur constantly. There is the observation 
that "China is like the battleship Yamato. Unlike maneuverable 
Japan, China is not easily stirred into action but, once it 
begins to move, it is difficult to stop, so extreme measures 
must be taken" (Ryoichi Kawai, chairman of Komatsu, Ltd.). 
  However, for Japanese companies troubled with recession, 
entry into China, a huge market nearby, has become an important 
operational issue. Nevertheless, as compared with European and 
U.S. firms, the hesitancy of Japanese companies is noticeable.

  [Text] Risks Must Be Taken To Succeed--Part With 
Hothouse-Nurtured Japanese Management; Overturn Domestic 
Rankings in New Market 
  There are huge potentials as well as various risks in China. 
However, now that dependence on the U.S. market has reached the 
limit, Japanese companies should manage their own risks and 
develop the Chinese frontier. There are no returns without risks. 
<H3>  "Neophyte Group to Virgin Market"--Uniden Corp. Depends on 
Youngsters in Thirties </H3>
  Direct investment by Japan in China during the past year 
totaled $2.1 billion, surpassing the aggregate amount of the 
previous 13 years. The underlying factor is the increase of 
smaller enterprises planning to make inroads into China because 
of deteriorating profitability of domestic production with the 
rapid yen appreciation but views are being raised that "the time 
is gradually approaching to reassess making entries as stopgap 
measures" (Akiko Mase, deputy chief of Joint Venture Consulting 
Office, Japan-China Association on Economy and Trade). 
  However, among Japanese firms, there are some which are 
promoting business with China with a clear vision and long-range 
strategy. Though by no means in the industrial mainstream in 
Japan, these companies, which have begun to occupy important 
positions ranking with Overseas Chinese and U.S.-European 
capital in the new territory called China, are showing the 
frontier spirit which big corporations have begun to lose. 
  Xinyou S&amp;T Development Co., Ltd.--a joint venture of 
communications equipment manufacturer Uniden Corp. and Chinese 
state-operated investment company CITIC (China International 
Trust and Investment Corp.)--which sells Uniden products, opened 
its fourth domestic branch office in Wuhan in mid-September. 
  Mariko Osato (30 years old) assumed the position of chief 
representative of the new resident employees' office. Osato was 
interviewed when she returned to Beijing to attend an 
electronics show. She said nonchalantly, "Last week, I went 
alone to Wuhan and selected the office location. I will be 
residing in Wuhan from next week and I'll be alone for the time 
being. However, there's no need to worry. I have many things to 
do." 
  Osato joined Uniden only a year ago. After graduating from 
Tokyo University, she worked at Japan IBM. Subsequently, she 
enrolled at Northwestern University and earned an MBA degree. 
While in the United States, she was recruited by Uniden and soon 
after returning and joining the company, she was sent to 
Beijing. She is by no means an expert on China and she began to 
study Chinese after her assignment there, so she is a neophyte. 
  "Looking at barefooted persons, you can think what a 
terrible 
place you came to or you can think of all the shoes you can sell 
here, so there are two ways of thinking for a person and a 
company. China is a frontier." That is the way Osato thinks. 
  At present, Uniden has eight resident employees in China, 
including Hong Kong. Nobuya Sada, chief representative in Hong 
Kong, formerly served in the subsidiary, Uniden 21, and is 30 
years old. He had an outstanding record in the company's foreign 
sales of crystal oscillators and was handpicked by the parent 
company. Isao Sakai, chief representative of the Shenzhen 
office, is also 30 years old. Akira Fukushima, chief 
representative of the Shanghai office, is 28 years old. 
  Both were unequaled top salesmen in Tokyo. All of the 
employees are young and each is competing in the huge Chinese 
market as the chief of his own sector. 
  Eyeing the potential of the Chinese market, Uniden started 
consignment production of portable telephones in Shenzhen in 
April 1989 and started joint production at an adjoining new 
plant in October 1989. 
  Chairman Yoshio Fujimoto's pet theory is: "With one-fourth 
of 
the world's population, China is certain to surpass 
U.S.-European markets. In the near future, China will account 
for one-half of this company's sales." 
  Uniden's strengths are its young, highly efficient force as 
well as the selection of a powerful partner, CITIC. CITIC is a 
type of conglomerate with a wide range of activities, including 
trade and finances, in addition to investment operations, and 
has a big pipeline to the core of the government. In June 1993, 
Uniden received approval for a type of portable telephone for 
China only two months after application, a procedure that 
normally requires from half to one year, thanks to CITIC's 
support. 
  The challenge now to Uniden is to break the domination of 
the 
U.S. giant, Motorola, which holds approximately 80 percent of 
the portable telephone market in China. In 1993, Uniden hopes to 
acquire a 20-percent share of the market, estimated at about 
500,000 units, and rise to the position next to Motorola. Takuya 
Kumagaya, who is serving as the general manager of Xinyou S&amp;T 
Development Co., says: "In China, companies with marketing 
strengths in their home countries do not necessarily win. Since 
this is a virgin market, you can devise operations through your 
own means. China's attraction is that neophyte groups, without 
preconceived ideas, have a better chance of displaying their 
strengths." Kumagaya, a former Sony technician, is another 
member of the group that studied in the United States and is 
only 39 years old. 
  Resident employees are staying in the same hotel in Beijing, 
where the main office is located, and gather almost nightly to 
drink and encourage each other. The vigor forgotten by Japanese 
companies that had passed the growth stage is alive here. 
<H3>  Rapidly Consolidating Production, Distribution, and 
Retailing--Yaohan Is Taking Advantage of Being First </H3>
  In state-owned department stores, 7 percent of the 
merchandise is stolen by employees and others, goods are 
carelessly thrust to customers, employees do not greet 
customers, employees litter the floor, etc. That is China, but 
Yaohan is trying to implant the Japanese-style customer-first 
retail service. 
  As the first store in China, the Saide shopping center 
(Beijing Yaohan) was opened last fall. Four times a day, 
Masahiro Kurosugi, the general manager, stands behind the cash 
register clerk and checks on the customer service of sales 
personnel. He checks to see if product names and prices are 
being read aloud as the cash register is punched, whether 
customers are being greeted sincerely, etc.; at first, employees 
resented his close guidance. 
  Kurosugi says: "There is still a misunderstanding in China 
that capitalism means moneymaking. I want to convey to the 
Chinese people the cultural aspect that service is the heart of 
capitalism and that, if one pleases the customer, one will 
benefit in the future." 
  Yaohan Japan's investment ratio in this store is 19 percent. 
The Chinese subscriber, CVIC (China New Technology Creation 
Investment Co., Ltd.) has the authority over finances, 
merchandise stocking, and price setting; Yaohan only has the 
right to act as business adviser under the contract. 
  At first, the Chinese placed illegal prices of 100 yuan 
(approximately 2,000 yen) on a package of sashimi for two or 
three persons, allegedly because the main customers of 
foodstuffs were Japanese who were rich, and asked to sell 
teakettles next to the cosmetics corner near the first-floor 
main entrance because "they sell well." Kurosugi painstakingly 
explained why each of these actions was wrong. At times, he let 
the counterparts do as they please and waited patiently until 
they realized their own mistakes. 
  His efforts paid off and Kurosugi says, "In less than a 
year, 
the employees certainly changed. Personally, I'm beginning to 
think that the idea of service is taking root unexpectedly fast 
in Chinese minds." 
  Chairman Kazuo Wada of Yaohan states: "In Japan, we cannot 
compete with our major predecessors like Daiei, Inc. and 
Ito-Yokado Co. However, Asia and China are unopened new 
territory." The aggressive inroad into China is based on Wada's 
thinking which stresses the importance of garnering markets 
first. 
  Starting with construction of the distribution center in 
Beijing and building of production bases for its own products, 
such as the ham factory in Shenzhen, Yaohan's large-scale plans 
to consolidate production, distribution, and retailing are 
advancing rapidly. Ahead are plans to establish 1,000 stores in 
China with the year 2010 as the target. The Beijing store and 
the Shanghai Pudong department store, scheduled to open next 
year, are the first steps. "If we can quickly nurture personnel 
with accumulated know-how, becoming the leading store in China 
will not be a dream" (Kurosugi). 
  Yaohan is receiving tie-up offers from 40 to 50 Japanese 
cosmetics, toiletries, and candy manufacturers, covering 
operations from production to sales in China. There is the 
expectation that "a retail-oriented distribution pattern, which 
is impossible in Japan where the manufacturers' domination is 
firm, is attainable in China" (Masaichi Tajima, Yaohan vice 
president). 
<H3>  Yamaha Undertakes Joint Venture Promptly--Aiming for Joint 
Production With Future Rival </H3>
  Traveling 30 minutes by car along the northern bank of the 
Yangzi River from Chongqing City in Sichuan Province, one begins 
to see on the left side a section along which a concrete wall 
stretches for a distance. The area behind the wall is the 
property of the state munitions manufacturer, Chongqing 
Construction Industry (Group) Co. 
  In a joint venture with the Construction Industry Co., 
Yamaha 
Motor Co. is building a two-wheeled vehicle factory at this 
site. Plans are to produce 60,000 vehicles annually in FY94, at 
the start of operations, and 200,000 units annually in FY97. 
  Shozo Arai, Yamaha director in charge of the China project 
headquarters, gives the following explanation for the decision 
on the joint venture: "China produced approximately 2 million 
two-wheeled vehicles in 1992 and is already one of the world's 
largest producers. The growth of China's two-wheeled vehicle 
industry will inevitably continue. In the near future, it will 
surely become Japan's tough rival. Therefore, assuming the 
risks, cooperative relations must be established with China 
using our technological superiority as the trump card." The 
strategy is to get close to China voluntarily and find the way 
for joint survival instead of competing as rivals. 
  China's annual production of two-wheeled vehicles was 3 
million this year and is expected to reach 5 million in several 
years. In contrast, Japan's domestic production was 
approximately 3 million vehicles in 1992 but production is 
leveling off. It is certain that China will become the big 
producer of two-wheeled vehicles, leaving Japan far behind. 
  Two-wheeled vehicles account for 50 percent of Yamaha's 
sales. Of the four domestic two-wheeled vehicle manufacturers, 
Yamaha depends most heavily on two-wheeled vehicles. The 
appearance of a powerful rival will have a big impact. 
Therefore, it joined forces before the future rival can become 
competitive. 
  For that reason, business with China was started early. In 
December 1979, soon after the reform and liberalization line was 
adopted, Yamaha held a product show independently in Guangzhou. 
Subsequently, the company provided technical guidance to 
motocross riders in Guangdong Province and established service 
centers in Guangzhou and Beijing. In 1983, the company concluded 
a technological assistance contract with Chongqing Construction 
Machinery Plant, the predecessor of Construction Industry Co., 
which is the present joint venture partner. 
<H3>  Daihatsu Ranks Next to Volkswagen--Failure To Make Inroad 
into United States Was Fortuitous </H3>
  Yamaha's sincere cooperation with the Chinese side helped 
win 
the trust of the Chongqing City government. Moreover, Chen 
Zisheng, president and general manager of Construction Industry 
Co., is a deputy of the National People's Congress elected from 
Chongqing City. He has a pipeline to key personages. 
  There are 21 technicians from Japan stationed at the 
joint-venture company, "Yamaha Construction." The biggest future 
task is the nurture of affiliated parts manufacturers. The 
success of local operations depends on whether high-quality 
parts can be procured stably. For this reason, for three months 
from March 1993, machinery manufacturers in Sichuan Province 
were personally inspected. 
  In Chongqing, a leading industrial city in China, production 
bases are still scattered in mountainous areas for national 
defense reasons. Just to visit one company requires a jolting 
10-hour one-way car ride. Once a trip is undertaken, it is not 
possible to return to Chongqing for one or two months. 
  However, the support of the Construction Industry Co. was of 
big help on this occasion. They took care of various matters 
from selecting which parts manufacturers to visit and obtaining 
permission to thoroughly inspect manufacturing processes. 
  Main parts manufacturers have already been narrowed down to 
about 30 companies. Of the 500 parts to be procured outside of 
the company, trial manufacture of 100 parts was consigned and 
the parts began to arrive from around August. "Initially, we had 
thought that it would be a success if the acceptance rate were 
about 20 percent, but 80 percent of the parts passed inspection. 
We will continue technical training on a three-year plan, 
henceforth, and hope to raise the domestic production rate from 
the 55 percent set when operations started to 80 percent." So 
stated Tsutomu Akusawa, assistant general manager, who was 
surprised at the unexpectedly fast improvement of China's 
production technology capability. 
  For the time being, Yamaha plans to retain the profits of 
the 
joint venture instead of allotting them to the main company. 
Rather than making immediate distribution of profits for the 
sake of Japan's main office, Yamaha opted to sustain growth in 
China. 
  Of the Japanese firms succeeding in China, many are not 
major 
companies in Japan. For example, Kentaro Shimizu, director in 
charge of the overseas business division of Daihatsu Motor Co., 
says: "When major companies were making inroads into the United 
States, our company wanted to enter, but couldn't. For that 
reason, we concentrated our efforts on Asia but strategically, 
that was fortunate for us." 
  Daihatsu is presently producing 50,000 vehicles a year 
locally and estimates it can expand production to 150,000 in 
1997. Of course, it is the leader among Japanese firms and, even 
including U.S.-European companies, it ranks second after 
Volkswagen. 
<H3>  Limit Reached in Low-Risk Business Dependent on United 
States--Self-Reform Needed To Attain Growth </H3>
  After World War II, Japanese companies sold surplus 
industrial products to the United States and continued to grow 
using that as a leverage. Simply put, under such circumstances, 
businesses could be run profitably by only watching U.S. trends. 
Risk factors, such as market selection and timing and scale of 
investment, did not have to be considered carefully as long as 
firms were under the U.S. umbrella. Japanese companies, which 
were given a stable export market and the opportunity to operate 
at low risk, were able to manage somehow if they did not neglect 
efforts to move ahead. 
  However, it has become impossible to run on the track laid 
by 
the United States. Japanese companies can no longer depend on 
the U.S. market. Putting aside firms that are determined to 
survive only in the saturated domestic market, many Japanese 
firms, which think that "enterprises must seek growth," will 
probably be forced to enter the Chinese market, willy-nilly. 
  China is a high-risk market that is totally different from 
the United States. There are many risks that are different in 
nature from past risks, such as inadequate legal systems and 
business methods that are totally unlike capitalistic countries, 
defective financial systems, bottlenecks in distribution, 
energy, and communications infrastructure, etc. However, it is 
difficult for Japanese companies to escape from the current 
confined environment unless they enter China. The strength is 
needed to risk entry into the huge Chinese market and survive 
without being swallowed up. 
  Wang Songnian, director of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese 
Association and chairman of Ashu Kogyo (Asian Industrial 
Promotion) Co., a consulting firm for investments in China, 
points out that Japanese companies entering China fail because 
"those in charge do not think on the local level." In Japanese 
firms, responsibilities are shared so it is difficult for a 
person to make decisions independently and few responsible 
officials can speak Chinese. Persons who make decisions might go 
on short visits, but do not take the trouble to learn the actual 
situation firsthand by living there. He says that it is 
important to undertake the task with the intent to be personally 
involved instead of making judgments based simply on desktop 
feasibilities studies. 
  As for these Japanese firms in the effluent stream, so to 
speak, whether they view their ventures to achieve success 
through their own means as "making inroads into China because 
they cannot succeed in Japan" or "because Japanese society is so 
rigid that new businesses cannot be accepted" will determine the 
dynamism of their future development. 
  Japanese-style management, which is strong on joint sharing 
of information based on bottom-up collective operations and 
internal group control, is suitable for moving rapidly in a 
specified direction, but is likely to be slow in making 
judgments when the direction must be changed expediently in 
response to risks. Developing the frontier called China is a 
challenge to Japanese corporations to undertake self-reform. To 
be tested is the Japanese-style management which was nurtured in 
a hothouse.

  [Text] Optimistic View on Inflation Control "Because 
of Tenacious Zhu Rongji" 
  Since Vice Premier Zhu Rongji assumed the position of 
Central 
Bank president concurrently, China has undertaken adjustment 
measures in earnest. There are many problems, including 
financial system reforms, but Japanese companies on the scene 
are generally optimistic. 
  Approximately 40 km from Shanghai City center, the 
industrial 
zone of Songjiang County, Shanghai City, is located. Since land 
prices and personnel expenses are cheaper than in Shanghai City 
center and laborers who do not dislike factory work are 
plentiful, the interest of Japanese companies in the zone has 
been increasing recently. 
  A neatly paved highway runs from Shanghai City to Songjiang 
County. The scenery of Shanghai outskirts, observed when 
traveling on this road to visit the industrial site, was very 
impressive. 
  Waterways ran here and there in the extensive paddy fields. 
Groups of several farm houses were standing. It was a rural 
scene commonly found in Japan. Many apartment houses and deluxe 
villas were under construction. There were even buildings to 
which access roads could not be seen at all. 
  When I asked, "With all these apartments and villas being 
built, are people really going to live in them," the local guide 
replied, "Hong Kong and Taiwan investors are buying them for 
speculative purposes." 
  Redevelopment projects have climbed to approximately 300 in 
the center of Shanghai. Concerning this real estate development, 
a knowledgeable source said: "From around last fall, the names 
of influential figures began to appear. I had been thinking it 
might be a recurrence of `government corruption' (illegal acts 
by government officials), which became a problem during the 
Tiananmen incident, when the big campaign to prevent corruption 
started." 
  Though not related to real estate, an agent who personally 
brokered currency exchanges without going through the foreign 
exchange control center and collected commissions was said to 
have been prosecuted recently. This action might be considered a 
part of the campaign to prevent illegal and corrupt practices. 
  Since Deng Xiaoping's visit to the south in early 1992, 
China 
accelerated the speed of economic growth. As growth accelerated, 
inflation spiraled and speculative property and stock 
manipulations intensified throughout China. 
  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji is the official who is fighting to 
restrain the economic overheating that the Chinese call the 
"bubble." 
  As soon as Vice Premier Zhu took over the Central Bank 
presidency concurrently in July, control measures, such as 
reraising of interest rates, early recovery of illegal or 
speculative loans by financial institutions, 20-percent cut in 
fiscal expenditures, etc., were presented one after another. 
<H5>  Control Measures Begin To Show Results </H5>
  "Prices of steel materials and cement have stopped rising 
and 
in fact, seem to be falling. For construction companies like 
ours, that is a desirable trend." 
  So states Hachiro Yamano, acting chief of the China Office, 
Fujita Corp. At present, the company is independently developing 
an industrial site in Shanghai's Pudong New Area, a national 
project. 
  Construction materials have spiraled in cost because of the 
real estate boom. In Shanghai, during the one-year period 
beginning April 1992, prices increased approximately 70 percent 
for cement, 95 percent for steel rods, and 150 percent for 
lumber. 
  "Land prices soared, too, because of the infrastructure 
buildup in the Pudong New Area and redevelopment of the old 
urban area. However, probably out of caution for monetary 
tightening, real estate has not moved since summer" (Shinichiro 
Sugano, manager of Shanghai branch, Industrial Bank of Japan). 
  As for stocks, too, the price index jumped from 393 in late 
1992 to 1,532 in February 1993 in the Shanghai market, out of 
speculation craze, but it plummeted after control measures took 
effect and has fallen to the 800 level. 
  Also, at the Shanghai foreign exchange control center, the 
exchange rate has stabilized from approximately 11 yuan to 8.8 
yuan to the dollar after enforcement of the control measures. 
  Thus, as far as curbing excessive property and stock 
investments are concerned, the effect of the restraining 
measures has become evident. However, separate from the central 
government's concern, the effect has begun to appear even in 
sound corporate operations. 
  Liu Shunxin, deputy director, Shanghai City Commission of 
Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, and head of its foreign 
affairs office, denies the effect of the control measures on the 
current Pudong development, saying "it is a priority national 
project and there is no problem in fund procurement." On the 
other hand, he says, "There is some effect on procurement of 
renminbi yuan (RMB) in joint ventures. 
  Since banks are extremely tight on granting new loans, there 
are cases where counterpart state enterprises cannot procure 
people's yuan and joint venture plans tend to be delayed. 
  "State-owned enterprises, with which we are not familiar, 
contact us unexpectedly or send letters asking for loans" 
(Tsutomu Hiroe, deputy manager of Shanghai branch, Bank of 
Tokyo). 
  There are cases where the opening of a letter of credit (LC) 
is delayed because of the squeeze on the Chinese company's 
funds. "There are even cases where the banks demand 100-percent 
deposit in foreign currency" (Terumasa Iohara, head of Shanghai 
office, Mitsubishi Corp.). 
  Also, Hiroshi Komata, general manager of Shanghai Isetan, 
says, "Since September, sales of all Shanghai department stores 
have been falling." A native of Shanghai pointed out that 
Isetan's location on "Nanjing Road was a place where people from 
the country and foreign tourists visit; fashion-conscious 
Shanghai residents go to Huaihai Middle Road." A store was 
opened in June 1993 on that Huaihai Middle Road. 
  The effects of these restraining measures are beginning to 
appear gradually not only in Shanghai but in various places. 
<H5>  Financial System Reform Is the Key </H5>
  "Macroeconomic control"--that is the phrase that is 
presently 
being used like a catchword in China. 
  Zhang Yunfang, deputy director of the Development Research 
Center, affiliated with the State Council of the central 
government, states, "I think that the reform and liberalization 
course has entered a new stage." He adds: "The reform was 
carried out until now while maintaining the planned economy 
setup, but hereafter, there must be a substantive change toward 
market economy. To do that, a systematic reform must be promoted 
to build the system that is suited to market economy. 
  Future economic management will be switched from the 
"command-type," based on fiscal policies, to the 
"coordinated-type," based on market economy. That is the real 
meaning of "macroeconomic control." 
  Therefore, the central government is now pushing financial 
system reform as the top-priority task. At the "Japan-China 
International Monetary and Financial Symposium" (sponsored by 
the State Council's Development Research Center and Japan-China 
21st Century Economic Symposium) held on 13 September in Beijing 
with deputy director Zhang Yunfang as the Chinese secretariat 
chief, the basic steps of the financial system reform were 
announced. The main points are: 
  1. Separation of governmental and commercial banks. 
Long-term 
development credit banks, export-import credit banks, and 
agricultural banks will be newly established while governmental 
banks will be converted to independently operated commercial 
banks. 
  2. Nurture of financial markets. Short-term capital markets 
and intra- enterprise short-term loan markets as well as short 
exchange markets, securities markets, etc., will be organized 
and developed. 
  3. Strengthen the functions of the People's Bank of China as 
the central bank. Devise means to stablize the RMB rate and 
control currency supply. 
  As the economic overheating worsened, the so-called "three 
financial misdeeds," i.e., illegal procurement of funds by 
financial institutions, illegal loans, and chaotic business 
operations by the banks, began to occur frequently. These 
practices aggravated the disorderly establishment of development 
zones and speculation in real estate and stocks. 
  "Even the regional branches of the People's Bank of China, 
which is the central bank, have stronger ties with local 
entities than with the main bank. For that reason, although the 
central bank tries to control currency supply, branches make 
loans in response to requests of local governments and 
influential local leaders" (Japanese corporation). 
  Reportedly, there are many cases where the banks themselves 
engage in property and stock speculation through nonbanks. 
  With respect to loans by financial institutions, call-in 
instructions were issued with the deadline of 15 August. "Loans 
by banks that were illegitimate because of interest rates, time 
limitations or usages were recovered" (Chinese bank official). 
According to the media, 72.7 billion yuan, or one-third of the 
targeted amount, were recovered nation-wide. 
  Unless these systematic defects are overcome, "macro 
economic 
control" through financial policies is still just a dream. 
  Under present conditions where policy tools are still far 
from adequate, coercive tightening by the government is 
inevitable. The fact that extreme restraints on bank loans are 
presently affecting not only property and stock speculations but 
even sound business operations may be said to be the negative 
effect of such policies. 
  Because "triangular claims" (bad claims with debts being 
passed along among companies) have reappeared, views are being 
expressed that the policy might change again to monetary easing. 
However, the problem is how the aforementioned financial reform 
can be realized by relying on such short-term tightening and 
easing measures. Whether it is possible to get on a stable 
growth track, or not, also depends on that point. 
<H5>  Views Toward China Change </H5>
  "They should make a soft landing, somehow." 
  When Japanese companies in three locations--Dalian, Beijing 
and Shanghai--were questioned as to whether the current 
adjustment measures would be successful, the replies were 
generally optimistic. 
  The reasons given are the early start with countermeasures 
being planned from last fall, the lessons learned from the 
Tiananmen incident, etc., but above all, the fact that Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji, "who understands economics," has taken 
command is building up a strong confidence. 
  In fact, daily sundries and foodstuffs are abundantly 
available. Personal income has risen more than increases in 
commodity prices and conditions are different from those 
existing immediateldy before the Tiananmen incident. 
  A factor behind this optimistic view of Japanese companies 
is 
the basic change in posture of the Japanese industrial circle 
toward China: "Even the management of companies listed on the 
stock exchange's first section foresee the growth and future 
potentials of China and are beginning to think of long-term 
investments" (trading company source). 
  Sun Hunchao, director of the China-Asia-Pacific Region 
Economic Research Institute, expresses hope for steady 
investments by Japanese corporations: "As compared with U.S. and 
European enterprises, Japanese companies require time in making 
decisions but most of the projects that are undertaken are 
successful." 
  Jiao Sufen, director of the Foreign Investment 
Administration 
Office, Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Commission, 
states: "A liaison conference of multinational companies, 
including Japanese, was held for three days beginning 9 
September. During the conference, demands and proposals of 
multinational firms were brought up and there were many requests 
to establish holding companies and investment firms in China." 
He adds: "There are also companies that wanted to establish an 
Asian headquarters in China and conduct foreign currency 
exchanges at the headquarters." 
  When asked about concrete procedures for establishing 
holding 
companies, the reply came that "they are under scrutiny, at 
present" (Director Jiao Sufen). For the present, the guideline 
for approving holding companies seems to be that permission will 
be granted to a company with more than three established local 
corporations and over $10 million in new investments. 
  As large companies make inroads into China and start 
production in various areas, the advantages of establishing 
holding companies in China increase, such as consolidated 
management of taxes and finances, bulk purchases of raw 
materials, currency control among various bases, etc. 
  The emergence of these requests to establish holding 
companies probably signifies that entry into China of foreign 
capital enterprises has entered an important stage.

  [Text] Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, is scheduled to visit China from 8 January. A Foreign 
Ministry source said on 6 January that during a meeting with his 
Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen, Hata would confirm the gravity 
of security dialogue between Japan and China, and ask China to 
disclose as much military information as possible because ASEAN 
nations have expressed apprehensions over China's moves to 
strengthen its military power. Specifically, Hata is 
considering asking China to compile a "defense white paper" in 
accordance with international standards, the source said. 
  In recent years, China has increased its annual defense 
budget by two digits, has claimed rights over the Spratly 
Islands, and has intensified its activities in the waters near 
the islands. 
  Hata plans to tell the Chinese Government that Japan is 
interested in how China's military power will change. At the 
same time, he will ask China to use the "Japanese-Sino Security 
Council" as a place to open its military power to the world. 
The council held the first meeting of foreign ministerial 
officials of both countries in Beijing on 20 December. It is 
said that Hata plans to make those requests because he believes 
the repeat of frank exchanges of views between the two countries 
will lead to substantial multilateral security talks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Satsuki Eda, director general of the Science </F>
and Technology Agency, by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
correspondent; place and date not given; first paragraph is 
introduction] 
  [Text] Director General Satsuki Eda of the Science and 
Technology Agency gave an interview to a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
correspondent concerning his views on atomic energy and science 
and technology policies. In the interview, Eda stressed his 
stance to render decisionmaking procedures more flexible via 
such measures as public hearings on revision of the government's 
long-term atomic energy program. He also disclosed Japan's 
desire to construct the International Tokamak Experimental 
Reactor (ITER), a new reactor being jointly developed in Japan 
by Japan, the United States, Europe, and Russia. Following are 
questions and answers from the interview: 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There is an opinion among the public 
that no change has been observed in the coalition's atomic 
energy policy since the period of the Liberal Democratic Party 
[LDP]. What is your comment? 
  [Eda] I have no intention to revise construction policies 
for plants' reprocessing of used nuclear fuel, or for policies 
promoting the fast breeder reactor [FBR] project. The coalition 
took over the LDP policies on these points. However, we are 
happy to hear the opinions of those who oppose the government 
projects. If a public hearing is held successfully, the next 
long-term atomic energy program will contain more flexible 
decisionmaking procedures. To make some significant changes in 
atomic energy policies, it is necessary to revise practices 
established during 38 years of LDP rule. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Are you progressing in establishing 
the coalition parties' consensus on atomic energy policies? 
  [Eda] It is true the stances of the coalition parties toward 
the atomic energy policies are widely varied, and they have 
never had a uniform opinion on any subject in this field. Since 
atomic energy issues are evoking much controversy worldwide, it 
is quite normal that the coalition parties have various opinions 
on these issues. Even if there are differences in opinion, we 
can still go ahead. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] It is believed a revision of the 
government's long-term atomic energy program is badly behind 
schedule. What is your position on this? 
  [Eda] The delay in revising the long-term program will not 
affect any projects. While construction of demonstration 
reactors for the new converter reactor and FBR will be slightly 
delayed, these have nothing to do with the revision of the 
program. The delay in the revision of the program is quite 
normal because this is a part of policy revisions following the 
political turnover. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What are the future goals of the 
science and technology policies? 
  [Eda] While Japan has been growing smoothly, it is now 
facing a great recession. Science is a major tool to 
systematically overcome the present situation. Therefore, we 
must think about such drastic measures as building up 
information super highways and constructing an ITER in Japan. 
Economic policies should be discussed in line with the 
direction of science and technology policies.

  [Text] On 29 December the government disclosed it is 
considering plans to increase official funds for the Housing and 
Urban Development Corporation [HUDC] to promote new purchases of 
land so as to construct apartments as part of its pump-priming 
package. By increasing official funding, the government hopes 
unused and under-utilized land in large cities will be put to 
public use and will encourage private real estate transactions. 
It also hopes this will help increase the money supply and stop 
the current economic downturn. 
  In the fiscal 1993 budget, the government allocated 4.5 
billion yen to the HUDC to encourage the purchase of land for 
building apartments (3 billion yen for regular apartments and 
1.5 billion yen for specially-designated apartments). The 
government plans to provide additional funding in the fiscal 
1994 budget as well as possible allocations from its third 
supplementary budget. It is also considering easing 
requirements regarding official funding. 
  Funding to help the public corporation secure land for 
apartment buildings was first established in 1991. Funds 
extended from the government's general account are a maximum 14 
percent of the purchasing cost of the land (allocated as 
treasury investments and loans). 
  Starting in fiscal 1993, the government can extend funds for 
use in the corporation's large-scale projects, such as apartment 
buildings. These funds will be used to purchase land from the 
Japan National Railway Settlement Corporation and unused lots 
where closed factories are located. In such projects, the 
government can extend funds not exceeding 10 percent of the cost 
of the purchased land. 
  The government and the ruling coalition parties have begun 
considering other possibilities to help promote the liquidation 
of land. For example, they have begun to consider easing the 
land trade monitoring system, reviewing the capital gains tax on 
land transactions, and establishing a "Land Holding 
Organization" (tentative name). By increasing funding to the 
HUDC, the government can also hammer out financial support 
toward this effort. 
  The amount of additional funds will be determined by the 
Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Construction, and other 
related government ministries and agencies. The government is 
also considering easing funding requirements concerning such 
aspects as the ratio of building volume to lot, floor area, and 
the number of permissible housing units. 
  When the purchase of land for HUDC apartments has 
progressed, 
the outlook will become certain on the price of land in the 
surrounding commercial areas where land transactions have slowed 
due to uncertainties in future land prices. It is hoped this 
would lead to resumed market activity and help promote 
liquidation of land through the recovery of market demand.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Japan will take spontaneous 
actions rather than depend on foreign pressure to conclude the 
stalled framework trade talks with the United States, Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata said Tuesday [11 January]. 
  Hata told a news conference that there are priority areas in 
the ongoing trade framework talks with the United States and 
that Tokyo wants to do its utmost to come up with good results. 
  Japan will negotiate with the United States with 
independence 
and will keep in mind the improvement of Japanese living 
standards, and not just place importance on its relation with 
the United States, he said. 
  Hata also called for U.S. efforts in bringing the bilateral 
talks to a successful conclusion. 
  He countered U.S. calls for Japan to boost market shares of 
foreign goods to the level of other industrialized nations, 
saying there is agreement on free trade.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Japan's trade minister 
suggested Tuesday [11 January] that Tokyo will reject U.S. calls 
for administrative guidance to reduce its trade surplus. 
  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai 
said at a press conference, "We cannot practice managed trade or 
allow administrative guidance only to reduce the surplus with 
the United States by using double standards at home and abroad." 
  "The government of (Prime Minister Morihiro) Hosokawa is 
trying to create transparency in markets," Kumagai said. 
  Referring to reported U.S. criticism that bilateral trade 
framework negotiations have faced hard going due to Japan's 
bureaucracy, Kumagai said that bluff or dissatisfaction may be 
expressed when negotiations reach the final stage. 
  "At least, I don't think the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry insists on its own logic being accepted," Kumagai 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- A senior U.S. official 
urged Japan on Tuesday [11 January] to make efforts for progress 
in bilateral "framework" trade negotiations, a cabinet official 
said. 
  Joan Spero, U.S. under secretary of state for economic and 
agricultural affairs, made the call in her talk with Deputy 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama at Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's official residence. 
  During the 45-minute talk, Spero said she understands well 
that Hosokawa has been focusing on political reform but demanded 
that Tokyo work to produce favorable results of the bilateral 
trade talks once the domestic task is completed, the official 
said. 
  Pinpointing priority fields in the negotiations, including 
automobiles and auto parts and the Japanese Government 
procurement of U.S. equipment, the U.S. under secretary 
reportedly sought Tokyo's efforts to achieve progress in such 
fields. 
  Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton are scheduled to 
meet in Washington on February 11 and assess progress in the 
framework talks. 
  Hatoyama voiced hope the bilateral negotiations will be 
successful with efforts from both sides, the official said. 
  Saying the Japan-U.S. trade talks should be two-way talks, 
Hatoyama also reportedly told Spero that Tokyo is opposed to the 
setting of numerical targets to measure the openness of Japan's 
markets. 
  The deputy chief cabinet secretary also noted that the 
Japanese Government cannot promise anything out of its reach in 
the talks on the opening of its markets, the official said. 
  Spero responded that Washington is only insisting on setting 
"quantitative and qualitative indicators" to gauge improvement 
in U.S. access in Japanese markets, the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- A U.S. senator voiced hope 
Tuesday [11 January] that Japan and the United States can 
achieve some progress in bilateral trade talks in February, a 
Foreign Ministry official said. 
  Sen. John Rockefeller IV said in a meeting with Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa that the U.S. Congress will focus its 
attention on a meeting between President Bill Clinton and 
Hosokawa scheduled for February 11 as a "checkpoint" of 
bilateral trade ties, the official said. 
  The Democratic senator elected from West Virginia also 
reportedly said the U.S. legislature hopes the two leaders can 
chart a new future course for U.S.-Japanese trade relations at 
the planned talks. 
  The statement apparently means the U.S. Congress wants some 
progress in trade negotiations between Washington and Tokyo, 
which are being held under the bilateral trade framework 
agreement reached last July. 
  While acknowledging the importance of progress in the trade 
negotiations, Hosokawa touched on the need for efforts from both 
sides, the official said. 
  Calling Clinton and Hosokawa reform-oriented leaders, 
Rockefeller said he is pleased with Hosokawa's emergence as a 
new leader in Japanese politics and that he wants to be a friend 
of the premier, according to the officials. 
  Rockefeller told reporters after the meeting that his talks 
with the premier were "just a private conversation."

  [Text] Sapporo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Visa-free exchanges of 
visits between Russians from a group of disputed islands off 
Hokkaido and Japanese have brought Russian islanders to a point 
where they no longer view Japan as an enemy state, the leader of 
a delegation of islanders said Tuesday [11 January]. 
  Kuril District Administration Chief G. Dolin, assessing the 
results of two years of visa-exempt exchanges, said, "the fact 
that we islanders have stopped viewing Japan as an enemy is the 
most important change." 
  Speaking at a press conference in Sapporo, the capital of 
Hokkaido, Dolin said friendships have developed between Russians 
and Japanese, while the views of the Russians on the territorial 
dispute have moved closer to those of the Japanese. 
  The Russian delegation arrived in Sapporo on Sunday for a 
six-day stay in Hokkaido and Tokyo to coordinate a plan for 
visa-free group exchanges between neighboring regions of the two 
countries this year. 
  South Kuril District Chief N.A. Pokidin pledged at the press 
conference that efforts would be made to expand access for 
former Japanese residents and their relatives to graves dating 
from before the Russian takeover of the disputed islands. 
  The four islands -- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the 
Habomai islets -- were seized by Soviet forces at the end of 
World War II and subsequently repopulated by Russians. 
  Russian refers to them as the South Kurils, while Japan 
calls 
them its northern territories.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa on Tuesday [11 January] welcomed Ukraine's tentative 
agreement to completely remove nuclear weapons from its soil. 
  "That is a very fine thing," Hosokawa told reporters. 
  Hosokawa's remarks came after U.S. President Bill Clinton 
announced Monday in Brussels that Ukraine will sign an agreement 
with Russia and the United States on Friday on the scrapping of 
its 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and 1,800 warheads. 
  A government source noted that the fate of nuclear weapons 
left on Ukrainian soil after the disintegration of the Soviet 
Union has served for some time now as a source of anxiety. 
  The source called it "good news" that Ukraine will agree to 
remove them. 
  But when asked about the prospect for Japanese technical or 
financial assistance in helping Ukraine with that task, the 
source replied that no such assistance is planned.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- A private forum between 
Japan and Britain will hold its meeting from Friday to next 
Monday in London and Newport, Wales, to discuss security, 
bilateral ties and cooperation on global problems, the Foreign

  The Japan-UK 2000 Group, established based on an agreement 
reached in June 1984 between then Prime Ministers Yasuhiro 
Nakasone and Margaret Thatcher, will draw 12 participants from 
Japan and 19 from Britain, the ministry said. 
  Hisashi Owada, an adviser to the foreign minister, will also

  The participants will discuss security, bilateral economic 
relations, cultural and educational interchange, bilateral 
cooperation on common global problems, and future bilateral 
ties, and report the results of the discussions to the heads of 
government of both countries, it said. 
  The group has been holding meetings annually since 1985, 
alternately in each country. 
  To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the establishment of 
the group, a symposium will be cosponsored with the Royal 
Institute for International Affairs on January 17 and 18 in

  [Text] Kumamoto, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Police have obtained an 
arrest warrant for two crew members of a Thai freighter who are 
suspected of helping to smuggle 19 Thai men into Japan, police 
officials said Tuesday [11 January]. 
  According to investigators, the two crew members are 
suspected of violating the immigration and refugee recognition 
law by helping the Thai men slip into Japan when the freighter 
Jutha Jessica docked at Misumi, Kumamoto Prefecture on January 5. 
  The freighter left Misumi in Kumamoto Prefecture on Saturday 
and arrived in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture, on Tuesday. 
  Kumamoto police searched the ship for evidence that the crew 
members had violated the immigration laws and questioned the 
freighter's crew.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- Japan will cosponsor an 
eminent persons' meeting on the subjects of population and 
development on January 26 and 27 in Tokyo, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Terusuke Terada said Tuesday [11 January]. 
  The meeting will formulate its recommendations to a 
UN-sponsored conference in Cairo next September. 
  Some 20 high-level scholars, academics and political leaders 
who are well-versed in the problems of population will attend 
the meeting at the UN University in Tokyo, Terada said. 
  Participants will include such prominent figures as 
Norwegian 
Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, former Mexican President 
Miguel de la Madrid, former World Bank President Robert McNamara 
and Taro Nakayama, former Japanese foreign minister. 
  The meeting is to be held under the cosponsorship of the 
U.N. 
Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN University and the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa will address the 
opening ceremony. 
  The participants are expected to adopt a Tokyo declaration 
on 
the closing day. 
  The deliberations at the meeting will be recommended to the 
U.N.-sponsored International Conference on Population and 
Development, which is to be held in Cairo in September to 
discuss measures for problems related to the rapidly increasing 
world population. 
  Terada said Japan is by far the largest donor country for 
UNFPA, donating 59 million dollars in 1992 and as much as 63 
million dollars in 1993.

  [Text] Zagreb, Jan. 11 KYODO -- A Japanese fact-finding 
mission to the former Yugoslavia on Monday [10 January] 
inspected a United Nations protected area and a refugee center 
in Croatia. 
  The eight-member Foreign Ministry mission is looking into 
possible areas for an expanded Japanese contribution to the 
international efforts under way in the former Yugoslavia. 
  Shunji Yanai, director general of the ministry's Foreign 
Policy Bureau, said there is much Japan ought to do in the way 
of humanitarian assistance, such as helping with refugee camps. 
  He suggested that Japan could also help with reconstruction 
after the conflict is over. 
  The team, which left Japan last Friday, visited an inland UN 
protected area that is one of four such demilitarized sites set 
up in Croatia. 
  They also crossed a cease-fire line between Croatian and 
ethnic Serbian forces and visited the country's border with 
Bosnia-Hercegovina at the Sava river. 
  At each site, the Japanese were briefed by local officers of 
the UN protection force. 
  On Tuesday, the mission will visit the besieged Bosnian 
capital of Sarajevo and meet officials of the government there. 
They will also visit the Serbian capital of Belgrade and the 
Macedonian capital of Skopje before returning to Japan on 
January 17.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- An open bidding system will 
be introduced in April for state-ordered public works projects, 
according to a draft of the action program to open Japan's 
construction market. 
  The draft, obtained Monday [10 January] by KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE, said the step will be implemented from April "as much 
as possible" for public works projects sponsored by the central 
government and 85 public corporations, including the Japan 
Highway Public Corporation. 
  Under the current system, only designated contractors are 
allowed to participate in bidding for most public works 
projects, a practice which has drawn much fire from the United 
States. 
  Although the draft action program failed to specify the 
scale 
of projects which are subject to open bidding, it indicated that 
the minimum scale is 850 million yen if they are state-ordered. 
  But the draft did not come up with a clear answer to a U.S. 
request for bringing down the size of projects sponsored by 
local governments which will be put to open bidding. 
  The Japanese Government has proposed the threshold be 2.85 
billion yen. 
  The draft action program was submitted to a meeting of four 
concerned cabinet ministers earlier in the day before being 
reported to Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa. 
  It will be approved at a cabinet meeting on January 18, 
which 
will fulfill a Japanese pledge made last October to hammer out 
such a program early this year. 
  The pledge was made in a bid to avert yet another trade row 
with the U.S., which has threatened to retaliate if Japan fails 
to take steps to increase foreign access to its construction 
market by October 31. 
  The Japanese move helped soften the U.S. stance, persuading 
it to extend the original deadline to January 20. 
  The draft plan has been worked out mostly on the basis of 
recommendations made late December by a government advisory body. 
  As to public works projects concerning designing and 
consulting services, areas in which the U.S. has shown 
particular interest, the plan calls for the introduction of a 
half-open bidding system under which contractors selected in 
advance for their technological and other abilities will be 
qualified to place tenders. 
  Government sources said designing and consulting works which 
will be covered by the plan will be worth 85 million yen or more. 
  To prevent rigging and other types of malpractice, the 
program proposed the drafting by the Fair Trade Commission 
(FTC), the nation's antitrust watchdog, of guidelines on bidding 
by the coming summer. 
  Under the plan, a cabinet-affiliated body will deal with 
complaints about bidding procedures and results. 
  The program, however, failed to touch upon a proposal to 
halt 
preferential treatment as agreed bilaterally in 1988 for U.S. 
contractors in bidding for Japan's major public works projects. 
  The sources said the failure to deal with the problem is due 
to differences in opinion among government officials.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 10 KYODO -- The government is studying 
the possibility of raising the tobacco tax by about 1 yen per 
cigarette from April to make up for a revenue shortfall, 
government sources said Monday [10 January]. 
  The increase, if decided, would be the first since fiscal 
1986. 
  The government is also to consider raising the liquor tax, 
the sources said. 
  They said the government's revenue shortfall is expected to 
widen in fiscal 1994, starting April 1, as the consumption tax 
on automobile purchases are expected to be lowered to 3.0 
percent from the present 4.5 percent from April. 
  The tobacco tax now stands at 6.252 yen per cigarette. 
  A 1 yen increase in the tax would raise the government's 
revenue by about 320 billion yen per year while the reduction in 
the consumption tax on automobiles will decrease the revenue by 
about 100 billion yen, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 11 KYODO -- The government will not 
separate a consumption tax hike from an income tax cut to be 
included in the new economic stimulus package, Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [11 January]. 
  "That's not possible," Fujii told a regular press conference 
after the morning cabinet meeting. 
  He was referring to reported comments Monday by a senior 
government official hinting at an economic package including 
only an income tax cut in view of the strong opposition by the 
Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] to a consumption 
tax increase. 
  The SDPJ, the largest party in the coalition government, 
decided Monday to set up an action group to call for a large 
income tax cut without increasing the rate of the consumption 
tax, now standing at 3 percent. 
  Fujii also strongly rejected the government official's 
remarks that a November report by the Tax Commission, an 
advisory panel to the prime minister, proposing an income tax 
cut and a consumption tax hike in a single program, could be 
reviewed. 
  The finance minister stressed that Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa has vowed to "respect the tax panel's report" and this 
is publicly recognized. 
  Concerning the timing of the new pump-primer, Fujii 
reiterated that the Economic Planning Agency is working to have 
it ready by around mid-January as instructed by Hosokawa. 
  In press remarks earlier this week, Fujii indicated the 
government may launch the package on schedule even without 
including the tax cut, saying "inclusion of a tax cut was 
unclear" in Hosokawa's instructions. 
  Turning to the budget, Fujii said the Finance Ministry has 
never mentioned any intention of compiling a 15-month budget for 
fiscal 1994, as rumored in some quarters. 
  He said the ministry just intends to handle a third 
supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the fiscal 1994 budget 
together.
