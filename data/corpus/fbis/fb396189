<F P=106> [Article by Hiroshi Nakagawa, Bank of Japan: "The Commercial </F>
Service Price Index; Flexibility Through Deregulation; Favorable 
Effect on Consumption Levels; Abolishing Rigidity as 
Productivity Increases"] 
  [Text] [Boxed item: 1. The commercial services price 
index (CSPI), which captures price movements for all types of 
services transacted between businesses, is the third price 
index, the first two being the wholesale price index (WPI) and 
the consumer price index (CPI). 
  2. Changes in the CSPI chiefly reflect changes in 
supply costs, such as real estate prices, personnel costs, and 
the strength or weakness of service demands by business. 
  3. If we compare the CSPI to the domestic WPI 
(commodity prices), we find that in addition to the difficulties 
in making judgments directly overseas, the service industry is 
easily subject to upward pressures in personnel costs because 
the service industry overall is labor intensive. If labor 
productivity in the service industry can be increased by 
abolishing some firmly established fees through deregulation, 
the CSPI will move a bit more flexibly.] 
<H5>  Recent Stable Movement for the Third Price Index </H5>
  The commercial services price index (CSPI), created by the 
Bank of Japan (BOJ) and announced in January 1991, tracks price 
statistics which show price trends for each type of service 
transacted between businesses. For a long time this remained a 
void in price statistics despite a shift toward services in 
Japan's economic structure. 
  Heretofore in Japan the wholesale price index (WPI), which 
tracks price movements of commodities (things) transacted 
between businesses, and the consumer price index (CPI), which 
tracks the prices of goods and services purchased by households, 
have been employed as the representative price statistics. The 
CSPI, with the other two indexes, measures currency purchasing 
power and business trends and is a third set of price 
statistics, which carries with it a deflator function. 
  The current CSPI, which uses the 1985 inter-industry 
relations tables as its baseline, divides 714 products into the 
seven categories of "finance and insurance," "real estate," 
"transportation," "information services," "communications," 
"advertising," and "other services." The identified prices as a 
rule are contracted prices between businesses. About 2,400 
prices are currently collected in cooperation with 369 companies. 
  In calculating the index, the weighted average (Laspeyres 
formula), which is determined by a fixed weight given to an 
article taking as the basis from the inter-industry relations 
table the amount of intermediate trading, is calculated and then 
indexed with the base year (1985) equal to 100. Although 
previously this was released on a four-and-a-half period basis, 
beginning this July the index is released monthly. 
  If we look at the changes in the CSPI since 1985, we find 
that it generally moved laterally until about the middle of 1988 
and then climbed upward considerably into 1991, while its 
movement since has settled down (figure 2). 
  CSPI movements become clearer if we compare them to the same 
month the preceding year (because there are large seasonal 
increases in April and October when service contracts are 
modified, it is useful to look at movements in the CSPI in 
comparison to the same month for the preceding year as a basis 
for making judgments). 
  According to this, after being negative for the most part in 
1986, it shifted to the plus side and remained for a time within 
a stable range of a just less than 1 percent. However, since the 
fall of 1988, allowing for a temporary period of expansion in 
its growth rate brought on by the introduction of the 
consumption tax, until the end of fiscal 1990, it accelerated 
upwards almost in a straight line (its peak was February 1990 at 
5.7 percent; however, ignoring the consumption tax, the 
substantive peak was December 1990 at 4.1 percent). Following 
this, the rate of increase turned sluggish beginning in 1991 and 
from this April we have seen a growth rate of barely 1 percent 
(figure 3). 

  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  It is appropriate as with other prices that commercial 
service price movements be based on the relationship between 
supply and demand which in this case encompasses target 
services, but we do need to keep in mind the following points. 
<H3>  Trends in Commercial Demand and Their Reflection in Supply 
Costs </H3>
  First, regarding movement on the demand side, commercial 
service demands change reflecting trends in business earnings, 
economic transactions, the distribution situation, or investment 
trends in construction and equipment. Basically, commercial 
service prices follow these occasional trends in business 
conditions as a result. 
  Second are cost factors on the service supply side. Various 
cost factors for service providers, such as shifts in operating 
expenses for materials, fuel costs, and necessary real estate 
prices, etc., have an effect on CSPI as do increases in 
personnel costs and shifts in labor costs brought on by 
improvements in labor productivity from investments in 
automation. Among these, because the input weight for labor as a 
service category is currently high, changes in personnel costs 
have a powerful influence on commercial service costs (above all 
in civil engineering and construction, legal, and accounting 
service costs for "other services," software development under 
"information services," and passenger travel and freight 
shipments under "transportation"). 
  Third, exogenous factors such as movements in interest rates 
and currency exchange prices, competitive promotion and 
deregulation mechanisms, and technological improvements have an 
impact on service prices in related fields. For example, both 
long-term interest rates for various leases under "other 
services" and maritime and international air freight for which 
numerous contracts are negotiated in foreign currencies under 
"transportation" have a tendency to manifest movement which 
reflects trends in exchange rates. 
  Moreover, although prices in airline passenger transport 
under the categories of "communications," "finance and 
insurance," and "transportation" have on the whole been trending 
downward since the index was started, this appears to be the 
effect primarily of lower fees and commissions brought on by 
deregulation and the promotion of competition through 
competitive rate drops and financial deregulation involving new 
entries into the electric power transmission business. 
  By the same token, the upward trend in the CSPI from 1988 
through 1990 reflects rising wage costs brought on by a tight 
labor supply and expanded commercial service demands together 
with increased construction activity and livelier corporate 
earnings, trading, and distribution. 
  Added to this was a further sharp increase in "real estate" 
service prices. Upward pressure on prices for "real estate" 
service costs such as office, store, and parking rentals can 
easily occur in any event given the supply side constraints at 
work in real estate. It is fresh in our memories how the rapid 
increase in demand for office and store space pushed up "real 
estate" service prices as land prices in the center of major 
cities skyrocketed during the so-called bubble economy. 
  By contrast, we can explain the recent sluggish rate of 
growth during this business recession in terms of a lowering of 
the upward pressure on wages caused by a combination of a 
softening in the demand for labor, decreased corporate demand 
for services, and a softening in the demand for real estate. 
  When we compare the movements in the CSPI, which is in phase 
with service prices among businesses, with those of the domestic 
WPI, which is the cost of things, there is a similar pattern on 
this point which reflects the fabric of supply and demand among 
businesses and which follows trends in business conditions. 
However, at the same time, the CSPI throughout has risen at a 
pace exceeding the domestic WPI and has reached a higher level 
with relatively less flexibility. 
<H5>  The Path To Reduced Differences With Commodity Prices </H5>
  Regarding this, first, the drop in import prices in recent 
years, reflecting stable international crude oil prices and the 
high yen exchange rate, has created an environment contributing 
enormously to the stability of the domestic WPI (direct 
judgments are difficult to make regarding the CSPI in terms of 
overseas factors, given the unique nature of service activities). 
  This and existing practices and regulations (licenses and 
notices), which directly relate to the setting of fees, and 
commercial services have influenced not a few fields, which 
impedes flexible price movements. 
  Further, there are differences between the CSPI and the 
domestic WPI in the impact of upward pressure in personnel 
costs. Excluding some fields such as finance and insurance, 
labor productivity in the service category is lower than for the 
manufacturing industry. There is a high weight assigned to 
labor costs in the input matrix (from preliminary calculations 
based on an extension of the inter-industry relations tables for 
1988, personnel costs nearly doubled to 35.0 percent for the 
CSPI subject services average as opposed to 18.7 percent for the 
domestic WPI). 
  This is one factor behind the sharper increase in the CSPI 
than in the domestic WPI during periods of tight labor supply 
and for its never falling smoothly when demand for services 
weakened. On the other hand, should productivity increase in the 
future in the service industry and shrink relative to the 
manufacturing industry, the potential is there for the gap 
between the CSPI, which represents service costs, and the 
domestic WPI, which represents commodity prices, to shrink for 
the same business phases. 
  Currently, expectations in numerous fields have burgeoned 
for 
deregulation as one pillar of our economic strategy. If we look 
at commercial services, we see that should relaxing or 
abolishing all regulations and ingrained practices move forward, 
prices will advance a step toward flexible responses to supply 
and demand relationships through the deregulation of established 
fees. Further, we can expect that productivity will be pushed 
upwards through the promotion of new entries and investments, 
making it easier to lower prices in the mid-term. 
  This will bring about a rise in the level of qualitative 
consumption through lower prices for the consumer and the 
elimination of foreign and domestic price differences and will 
contribute to an increase in the economic well being of the 
Japanese people.

<F P=106> [Article by Shigetaka Mayumi: "Information Highway: Japan </F>
Leads in Equipment, But United States Is Market"] 
  [Text] In hardware, Japan has led, but demand has burgeoned 
in the United States. Japan, too, must relax its regulations so 
as to encourage its communications companies to compete over 
services and use these high-tech products. 
  In 1992, the University of North Carolina in the United 
States began an experiment using a high-speed communications 
network for a cancer treatment involving X-rays. This is one 
part of the "information highway," a concept that Vice President 
Gore has taken the lead in promoting. In this treatment, 3D 
images from a CT scanner (a computer tomography device) are 
sent, through a telecommunication line, to a computer center, 
where they are processed by a supercomputer. CT images are 
normally difficult to tell apart, but the supercomputer 
three-dimensionalizes them, changing them into images that make 
it easy to determine at what angle and to what extent x-rays 
should be applied, and that are then sent to the physician. 
  A state-of-the-art "asynchronous transmission mode" (ATM) 
machine developed by Fujitsu is being used in the experiment. 
AT&amp;T in the United States, Northern Telecom in Canada, 
Siemens 
in Germany, Alcatel in France and other manufacturers throughout 
the world are frantically trying to develop ATM machines and 
other systems necessary for the information highway. However, 
NTT has led the way in the ATM field with the B-ISDN (broad-band 
ISDN = integrated digital communications network) concept, so 
that, according to an NTT representative, "The performance of 
[the machines of] Japanese manufacturers is presently at the 
top." 
  NTT's animated television pictures, the first to be 
developed 
in the world, can also be easily transmitted 
  In February 1990, NTT, in preparation for the age of 
high-speed communications, announced a plan to lay optical fiber 
to all the homes in Japan by the year 2015. In September 1990, 
NTT was the first in the world to experimentally manufacture an 
ATM switching machine, which it began supplying internationally 
in the fall of 1992. In response to NTT's activities, Japanese 
communications equipment manufacturers, such as Fujitsu and NEC, 
quickly began developing ATM switching machines and other such 
systems. 
  The United States feels threatened by these activities. 
Accordingly, one of the aims of Vice President Gore's 
information highway concept is for the United States to build an 
optical fiber network and take back the initiative in the 
optical fiber field. Ironically, the Japanese manufacturers, due 
to the above-mentioned activities, have a strong hold on ATM 
switching machines, which are the core for such a network. 
  ATM switching machines are the key technology that will be 
used in the next generation of communications services and 
B-ISDN. They are far more efficient than current digital 
switching and can also regulate data traffic, so that they are 
able to transmit at the high speed of 150 megabits/second (mega 
= million). They are from 100 to more than 1,000 times faster 
than the N-ISDN (narrow-band ISDN) that NTT is currently 
providing. 
  The data volume of animated pictures is more than 200 times 
that of compact disks; and with ATM, animated television 
pictures can easily be transmitted. Also, ATM can partition 
large-capacity telecommunication lines. Thus, ATM will become 
pivotal in cases where a multiplicity of computers spread out 
over remote areas are linked by telecommunication lines and 
large volumes of information are exchanged. 
  If ATM switching machines spread throughout the world, it 
will be possible for a company's Tokyo head office to retrieve 
document data from its research center in the United States and 
design data from its plant in Nagoya and conduct a television 
conference on product development with the staff of its Osaka 
office. 
<H3>  U.S. Telephone Companies Lead in Commercial Services; 
Japanese Companies Shift Their Focus to U.S. Market </H3>
  According to Kazuo Iwama, Product Planning Director of NEC's 
Switching and Transfer Communications Department, "In 1997, the 
ATM market worldwide will be 250 billion yen." Of this, the U.S. 
will account for 50 percent; Europe, 20-30 percent; and Japan, 
15 percent. There are already 20-30 switching machines operating 
in the United States. 
  The Williams Communications Group (Wilter), a long-distance 
telephone company, is using switching machines for its 
commercial services. It has installed them in eight locations, 
and plans to install them in still more. Of the Bell telephone 
companies, which split off from AT&amp;T, four--including Nynex 
and 
US West--have begun experiments aimed at using switching 
machines for commercial services. 
  On the other hand, NTT, in 1994, will introduce an ATM 
switching machine into a relay station and use it for relaying 
data transmissions. In 1995, moreover, it will begin a 
common-carrier-lease-line service; however, this will ultimately 
use no more than part of the functions of an ATM switching 
machine. A genuine B-ISDN service that can make full use of the 
capacity of an ATM switching machine will not appear until after 
the U.S. information highway project: in 1994, NTT will begin 
experiments [for such a service] in Kansai Scientific Research 
City. 
  In a word, Japan has led in the development of ATM machines 
and other hardware, but the United States is far ahead in 
communications services. With NTT at the forefront, Japanese 
manufacturers developed [this hardware] with the aim of 
introducing it domestically, but due to the domestic market's 
slowness in getting started, they have shifted their focus to 
cultivating the American market. 
  And they have steadily been achieving results. For example, 
NEC will deliver switching machines to Wilter and the 
independent company, GTE; and Fujitsu will deliver equipment to 
the four Bell companies for use in their experiment. In 1992, 
moreover, Fujitsu supplied Nynex and US West with switching 
machines for their commercial services. 
  The spread of ATM machines will depend on whether new 
services that fully use the power of ATM are created in the 
communications field. As in the experiment at the University of 
North Carolina, applications using images have already been 
developed; therefore, Fujitsu, believing that there is a strong 
possibility that ATM will be used at subscription telephone 
companies, has been aggressively trying to sell their product to 
the Bell telephone companies and other regional [phone] 
companies. 
  At the end of 1994, Fujitsu will begin manufacturing ATM 
machines at a plant in Texas. Since Fujitsu will provide the 
Bell companies with machines, the Bell companies asked it to 
establish a manufacturing division in the United States and to 
set up a support system for after sales. According to Akio 
Moritera, a representative of Fujitsu's Core Communications 
Headquarters, "Basically, it isn't profitable to carry out local 
production if there aren't sales of near 20 billion yen." 
However, Fujitsu has judged that the market for ATM machines 
will start up by 1995, and that adequate demand can be expected. 
  On the other hand, NEC believes that, for the time being, 
ATM 
switching machines will be used in a trunk line role, for 
relaying between switching machines. Its strategy is to wait to 
begin selling until after the regional telephone companies that 
link users to switching machines start coming up with truly 
high-speed applications, such as image transmission. 
<H3>  U.S. Companies Connect Their Individual LAN's; Relaxation of 
Regulations Also Leads to Transmission of Rental Videos </H3>
  Computer aided design (CAD) has come to be used in the 
development of semiconductors and automobiles. There are also 
examples of companies in which the main office's local area 
network (LAN) is connected to the research center's LAN by a 
telecommunication line. And LANs are installed not only in 
research centers and plants; in the United States, they also 
link various other places of work, thereby shortening the time 
required for product development. 
  According to NTT, the U.S. has 40 times more LAN-equipped 
plants than Japan. In computer graphics data, the data volume is 
large, so a large-capacity transmission route--from several 
megabits/second to 100 megabits/second--is necessary. Among LAN 
products, there are already high-speed ones that can handle 100 
megabits/second. For N-ISDN, 64 kilobits/second is basic, so LAN 
is faster by a double-digit factor. If high-speed LANs are 
installed and a system for sending image data--from CAD and the 
like--is set up, the system will be meaningless if the LAN's are 
connected with a line that has a small capacity. 
  If an ATM switching machine is used, a large volume of data 
can be sent even with a telecommunication line. Therefore, every 
service company is trying to deal with data transmission by 
introducing ATM's. Actually, ATM standardization has still not 
been completed. It is currently impossible to phone just anybody 
[with ATM]. Those who connect LANs are large corporations and 
other major customers of communication companies. U.S. 
communication companies have taken the bold step of introducing 
[ATM machines] with the as yet unstandardized parts made 
according to the company's own specifications. This is because 
they want to quickly respond to the desires of their big 
customers who connect LAN's. 
  In the United States, competition among communication 
companies is severe; there are over 100 regional telephone 
companies; and the competition is increasing. This is greatly 
different from Japan, where NTT has almost a monopoly. 
  As a result of liberalization, a new rival, CAPS, has 
recently appeared. CAPS are communication companies that, using 
optical fiber, link relay-related telephone companies, such as 
AT&amp;T, with their large corporate customers. Since CAPS do 
this 
without going through regional phone companies, they are called 
by-pass companies. The reason that Nynex, Bell South and other 
regional phone companies are hurrying to introduce ATM is to 
prevent their important customers from being lured away by the 
optical fiber of CAPS. 
  The relaxation of regulations has also been important. 
Because the Bell telephone companies are powerful telephone 
companies that succeeded to the assets of AT&amp;T, they were put 
under numerous regulations. Image transmission, such as cable 
TV, was also regulated. In 1992, however, the authorities 
concerned, the FCC, lifted the ban on video on demand (VOD) 
service. VOD is a service that could be described as the 
communication industry's version of rental videos: a customer 
informs the telephone company of a movie that he or she wants to 
see, and the telephone company then takes the movie from its 
data base and delivers it by telecommunication line to the 
customer. 
  This service is expected to become a main source of income 
for regional telephone companies. Nynex expects that "over the 
next 10 years, income from our voice service alone will be flat, 
but if, to [this] high-speed data transmission, image 
[transmission] is added, our income will double." The 150 
megabits/second capacity of ATM switching machines is basically 
unnecessary for data transmission alone, but it is necessary for 
image transmission. 
  Cable television companies have also developed a policy of 
installing optical fiber so as to counter the image transmission 
service of telephone companies. TCI, the top cable TV company in 
the United States, has invested about 1.9 billion dollars in 
building a digital optical fiber network with a total length of 
12,000 kilometers. 
<H3>  In the Regulation-Bound Japanese Communications Market, It 
Is Difficult To Develop Services for ATM </H3>
  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will install an ATM switching 
machine in the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama Building, 
which will open in the spring of 1994. Telephones, fax machines, 
and computers will be connected by LAN. An ATM machine will be 
used for the trunk line. At the stage when animated pictures and 
other multimedia start being sent from terminals, other ATM's 
will be installed for the branch lines. 
  In order to start a B-ISDN, an enormous investment is 
required. In an estimate announced by NTT in the spring of 1993, 
this amount was put at 45 trillion yen. Annually, NTT's total 
facilities investment is about 1.8 trillion yen. Even if all of 
this is invested in an B-ISDN, completion will take 20 years. In 
order to maintain this kind of investment, services that will 
increase income are needed. The one that is easiest to 
understand is an image transmission service. At present, 
however, telephone companies are unable to provide images to a 
large number of people simultaneously. 
  The Research Committee of the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications has estimated that, by 2015, the diffusion 
rate of B-ISDN's [in Japan] will be 77 percent. However, this is 
if attractive applications appear and transmission charges are 
inviting. If attractive applications do not appear, the 
diffusion rate will rise no higher than 12 percent. 
  In 1988, NTT began an N-ISDN, "INS Net 64." This N-ISDN was 
for the purpose of switching over from an analog phone line; at 
the same time, it kept charges down to analog phone levels. The 
goal was a system that "anyone can use anywhere." Thus, the 
region in which it is used has rapidly expanded. 
  As of the end of May 1993, however, the number of 
subscribers 
was 30,425. In May 1994, the number of registered telephone 
customers is expected to reach 59 million. As was anticipated, 
customers did not initially switch to the INS network, which was 
thus a service for which NTT ran a deficit. With the Japanese 
communications market hedged round with restrictions, there is 
little possibility that competition over the kind of services 
that require ATM will rapidly develop within it. Through much 
effort, Japanese ATM switching machines have become the most 
advanced in the world, but it seems that it is American 
communication companies who will be able to fully enjoy their 
performance.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Count-down Starts for Launching of </F>
`H-2' Rocket on 1 February"] 
  [Text] The launch date, 1 February, is nearing for the 
"H-2", Japan's first completely domestically-made large rocket. 
Japan has poured the best of its technologies into this program 
with the hope of joining the group of nations now leading the 
aerospace industry. Its performance is about to be tested. 
However, even if the test launch is successful, there remains 
the cost problem, which is much higher compared to European 
countries and the United States. The country's entry into the 
satellite launching market will not be easy. Moreover, the 
technology involved is an adventurous one that could be 
implicated in military use. As such, eyes of foreign nations 
are watchful. The future of Japan's rockets for space efforts 
does not look easy. 
<H5>  Tribulations </H5>
  The H-2 is a two-stage rocket. Its first-stage's main 
engine, the "LE-7," uses high technology that has only been 
practically applied in the United States in its Space Shuttle 
and in Russia in its Energia. As such, development of that 
engine has been painstaking. 
  In August 1991, a prototype engine exploded while underoing 
pressure resistance tests at a factory in Aichi Prefecture. The 
accident caused Japan's first casualties in its space 
development history. Masao Fukuda, chief of the Engine Team at 
the Guided-Propulsion System Manufacturing Plant in Nagoya of 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, recalled: "It was indeed 
incredible." 
  An overnight investigation revealed that an alloy-made pipe 
had cracks in its joint. The joint had been made by applying 
six to seven welds, but it was found that in the course of 
repeated welding, the alloy's composition, made of 10 different 
metals, had changed, thus reducing its strength. 
  That problem was later resolved by changing the method of 
making the pipe. But the engine exploded in a combustion test 
again in June 1992. The cause, once again, was bad welding of a 
pipe. Cracks developed inside the joint where high pressure and 
heat are concentrated. Mitsubishi's Takasa Research Institute 
had to develop a robot that could travel inside the pipe, much 
like a gastric camera, and scrape off bruises from welding. 
  A senior official of the National Space Development Agency 
of 
Japan [NSDAJ] recalled: "A failure in the engine's development 
was unpermissable from the standpoint of time and money, but if 
we did not experience those explosion accidents at the time, 
irreparable troubles could have occurred in actual future 
launchings." 
  Kenji Seyama, director of the Space Development Division in 
the Science And Technology Agency, said: "If the European 
countries, the United States, and Russia are professionals in 
rocket development technology, Japan is a fresh graduate of 
technical school." 
<H5>  19 Billion Yen </H5>
  The launching cost of the first H-2 rocket will run about 19 
billion yen. It is much higher than that ($100 million or about 
11 billion yen) needed for the Arian Rocket which is the leader 
in the industry. The NSDAJ issues very strict instructions to 
manufacturers, telling them, for instance, how to put bolts on, 
what tools to use, and how tight they should be. Invisible 
parts are required to be checked with X-ray machines. 
  Inspections by NADAJ technicians are scrutinized by the 
agency. Tomio Nakano, chief of the NSDAJ's Nagoya Office, said: 
"The processes are almost like court trials. We become judges 
sometimes, but then sometimes defendents also." 
  Akio Suzuki, chief of the Space Technological Department 
of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Nagoya Aviation and Space System 
Manufacturing Plant, said if they were to collect all the 
specifications stipulating items to be checked, and the report 
papers covering the mistakes they found and recording the 
troubleshooting methods used, the pile of papers, "would become 
three or four meters high." 
  Like its cars and semiconductors, Japan's rocket technology 
gained reliability as a result of strict quality control and 
successful launches. However, some people are concerned about a 
possible decline in quality control. 
  Suzuki said: "People who were working at the forefront of 
development have been promoted. It is very difficult to hand 
over to young engineers technology which requires strict quality 
control." 
  Development costs are also a concern. Jairun Claudon [name 
as published], Asia and Pacific regional representative of 
Arianne Space Corporation, the European rocket launching 
company, said: "The Japanese have been perfectionist in their 
rocket development. They are too nervous." 
  Hiroshi Imamura, director of "Rocket System," a company 
formed in July 1990 to launch the H-2 rocket, also commented on 
quality control, saying: "A review of cost savings may be 
needed." 
<H5>  Anxiety </H5>
  In November last year, staff members of the National Space 
Development Agency of Japan [NASDA] were astonished to read a 
WASHINGTON POST they found using a database search. 
  The article pointed out the possibility that Japan might 
turn 
to nuclear weapons to meet the threat posed by the DPRK's 
nuclear development program. It said the H-2 rocket "can be 
used as a missile and is a good match for the intercontinental 
ballistic missile (ICBM)." 
  NASDA officials became nervous, saying: "This is a 
misunderstanding. Japan's rocket development is strictly for 
peaceful purposes. It is unthinkable that we would use the H-2 
rocket as a missile." 
  Anxiety among some in the United States notwithstanding, the 
H-2 rocket is equipped with apparatus which has weapons 
applications. 
  One item is the "gyroscope," which is a core part of an 
inertial guidance system. It is used to determine the current 
location and flight position of the rocket and to calculate the 
orbit needed to meet a target. Although the United States 
provided gyroscopes to Japan, for a long time it refused to 
reveal its internal workings because, it argued, high-level 
military technology was involved. 
  However, Japan has developed a new type of rocket gyroscope 
which uses laser beams to cope with rapid changes in rocket 
position. 
  The United States did not provide Japan with the technology 
needed for reentry from outer space, either. Thinking that 
reentry technology could be used in the development of an ICBM, 
it stipulated in an official document signed in 1969 on space 
development cooperation between Japan and the United States, 
that "reentry technology and other related technology are 
excluded." 
  The first H-2 rocket will carry an experimental reentry 
machine [jikkenki]. The purpose is to develop a Japanese 
version of a space shuttle which will be called "HOPE." 
  NASDA regulations and Diet resolutions make clear that 
Japan's space development is strictly for "peaceful purposes." 
However, it is certain that Japan will obtain through its own 
work, technology which was previously the exclusive preserve of 
major nuclear states.

  [Text] Manila, Jan 25 (AFP) -- The Philippines may invoke 
a mutual defense treaty (MDT) with the United States if its 
forces are attacked by other claimants in the disputed Spratly 
islands, Defense Secretary Renato de Villa said Tuesday. But De 
Villa told foreign correspondents that the 1951 treaty, which 
calls for assistance against a third-party aggressor, does not 
guarantee automatic aid from Washington, unlike the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
  The Spratlys are a reputedly oil-rich and strategically 
located archipelago in the South China Sea which are claimed in 
whole or in part by China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, 
Taiwan and Brunei. 
  De Villa said any attack on Philippine troops, vessels or 
aircraft is considered an "act of aggression," in which case 
Manila can invoke the MDT, which exists despite the closure of 
US military bases in the country. But he said that "there is no 
such thing as an automatic response" if the Philippines invokes 
the pact although "it will trigger an action on the part of the 
US government." De Villa did not elaborate. 
  China and Vietnam maintain the largest garrisons and naval 
patrols in the Spratlys, and all claimants save for Brunei have 
some form of armed presence to press their claim. 
  Regional security experts warn that the Spratlys remained a 
flashpoint for conflict and urged wider dialogue and cooperation 
among the claimaints to avert a new Southeast Asian war. So far 
four informal workshops have been held. 
  The experts also said the United States is not likely to be 
dragged into a regional conflict unless its own national 
interests were directly affected, citing US reluctance to get 
involved in Bosnia and Somalia. 
  China routed Vietnam in a 1988 naval battle in the Spratlys, 
leaving an estimated 78 dead and 24 wounded on the Vietnamese 
side. 
  Security analyst Bilveer Singh of the Singapore Institute of 
International Affairs told a Manila seminar of regional think 
tanks earlier this month that China had overwhelming military 
supremacy over the other Spratly claimants. 
  China has 260,000 men, 94 submarines, 19 destroyers, 37 
frigates, 870 patrol vessels, 128 mine warfare vessels, and 60 
naval aircraft deployed in the South China Sea, he said, while 
Vietnam has the second most powerful presence.

  [Text] Source rocks for petroleum generation are present in 
the sub-surface of the Ragay Gulf Basin, about 200 kilometers 
southeast of Manila, Australian scientists reported. 
  The Australian Geological Survey Organization (AGSO) has 
released its first report on the petroleum potential of an 
offshore area in the Philippines. 
  The AGSO scientists' report includes 10 new maps, based on 
current and previously collected seismic data, and shows the 
structure of key horizons at a detailed scale, together with 
results of the offshore geochemical survey and analyses of 
samples taken from onshore oil seeps and exploration wells. 
  Findings on three other Philippine offshore basins would be 
due for release in March. 
  "In the Ragay Gulf Basin, the first of the four offshore 
basins, major fault systems controlling the distribution of 
hydrocarbon traps are now better understood and have been mapped 
more accurately than previously. An important limestone 
formation containing possible petroleum source and reservoir 
rocks is shown to be much more extensive than was thought 
previously, and includes reefal deposits which may provide 
attractive targets for future oil exploration. Large potential 
hydrocarbon traps in various parts of the basin were mapped with 
sufficient accuracy to estimate likely reserves," AGSO's project 
leader, Dr. Chao-Shing Lee said. 
  From March to May 1992, AGSO and the Philippine Department 
of 
Energy conducted a cooperative geophysical and geochemical 
survey to evaluate the petroleum potential of four offshore 
basins in the Philippines. 
  The $5 million project was funded by the Australian 
International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB). A total of 
nearly 3,000 line kilometers of seismic and 5,000 line 
kilometers of geochemical data was collected using AGSO's 
geoscientific research vessel, Rig Seismic. 
  "The new-seismic shooting achieved penetration to a greater 
depth than previously, allowing improved definition of key 
horizons and structural features," Lee said. 
  In geochemical surveying, a towed 'fish' measures the 
concentration of hydrocarbons dissolved in sea-water a few 
meters above the seabed. Analysis of the hydrocarbons will 
determine whether they are "fossil" hydrocarbons such as oil, 
gas, or condensate escaping from sub-surface rocks, or the 
product of recent biological activity in the water column or 
bottom oozes. 
  "Zones with anomalously high hydrocarbon concentration mark 
the sites where hydrocarbons are escaping from the seabed. By 
examining these zones in relation to the seismic data, it is 
possible to identify areas where hydrocarbons are likely to be 
accumulating," Lee said.

  [Text] THE police are keeping a close watch on some 
Chinese who came to Thailand as tourists but later applied for 
licences to run import-export companies. These people are 
suspected of involvement with human trafficking and other 
serious crimes, a police source said yesterday. The Chinese 
were mainly from China but some were from Taiwan. 
  The Chinese who were granted business licences would later 
name themselves managing directors and then seek permission to 
bring in their Chinese "colleagues" to fill other positions such 
as foreign affairs managers, quality-testing officials and 
overseas coordination officials, the source said. 
  Police suspected these people would then smuggle into 
Thailand Chinese who wanted to resettle in third countries 
before making overseas trips, mostly to the United States, when 
they would take the illegal immigrants with them, he said. 
Several Chinese have already been arrested in the provinces in 
connection with drug trafficking, evasion of criminal charges in 
their countries and killing of their business partners. 
  Police investigators were focusing on five cases where eight 
Chinese aliens were all shot to death with .38 revolvers, the 
source said. 
  In the first case, Nakhon Pathom police found the bodies of 
two Taiwanese men, Chuen Si Yuan and Lin Tong Huan, in Nakhon 
Chaisi district on July 9, last year. The second case occurred 
on August 10 last year, in Phetburi's Tha Song Yang district, 
where local villagers heard three gunshots before finding Siew 
Si Tong and Lai Sun Kiang, both from Hong Kong, had been killed. 
  Also on the same day, Phetburi's Muang district police found 
Li Chang Ho and So Seng Liang, who came from China, were shot to 
death.

  [Text] The Asian Music Industry Association recently 
suggested in a letter to the Secretariat of the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations [Asean] that Asean should implement a 
common agreement on copyrights to tighten protection within the 
region. 
  In response to the proposal, Khanitson Nawanukuro, deputy 
director-general of the Business Economics Department, said 
Asean senior economic officials will bring up the issue at their 
upcoming meeting in Jakarta Jan 27-28 to sound out opinions. He 
said apart from the copyright issue, Asean senior officials will 
discuss how to reduce tariffs on pulp under the Asean Free Trade 
Area (Afta) programme to a maximum of five per cent this year 
instead of within eight years as previously agreed. 
  Afta requires its members to cut tariffs on pulp to 
zero-to-five per cent over an eight year period. But Khanitson 
said Asean members will try to move faster on the tariff cuts to 
make Afta a reality as soon as possible. 
  Earlier, the Afta working committee studied the 
harmonization 
of product codes for customs purposes in a drive to lower 
barriers to trade. They concluded that Asean nations should 
accelerate tariff cuts for pulp, among others because it would 
be most beneficial to the member countries.

  [Text] The recent reshuffle of 1,784 police officers from 
the level of chief investigator up to deputy commander is facing 
stiff opposition from some officers who feel they were treated 
unfairly, a senior police officer said yesterday. 
  Pol Lt Col [Police Lieutenant Colonel] Nithi Charucharit, 
deputy commander of mounted police, said he has already 
submitted a letter to acting police chief Prathin Santiprapop 
seeking a review of the reshuffle list. Nithi said his 
seniority met the criteria for advancement, but he was 
overlooked. He is a law graduate of Ramkhamhaeng University. 
He said he has been a deputy superintendent for nine years 
without any sign of being advanced. Some of the officers 
promoted in the reshuffle had far less seniority. 
  Metropolitan police commissioner Pol Lt Gen [Police 
Lieutenant General] Chamlong Iamchaengphan had recognized his 
abilities in a certificate, Nithi said, but did not have the 
authority to change the reshuffle. 
  Pol Lt Col Thawisak Tuchinda, deputy superintendent of a 
special unit, has also petitioned Prathin to reconsider the 
reshuffle. 
  Pol Maj Gen [Police Major General] Suwan Suwandecho, a 
senior 
police of General Affairs Division, also said he will forward a 
protest letter to deputy interior ministers Suthat Ngoenmun 
(Democrat) and Chamni Sakdiset (Phalang Tham) requesting the 
reshuffle of 130 police generals be reconsidered. Suwan said 
justice should prevail in every reshuffle.

  [Text] The Australian Government is encouraged by a 
Chinese decision to cut tariff on some wool imports. From the 
start of this year, China reduced the tariff on short greasy 
wool from 15 percent to 10 percent, in recognition of the 
exchange rate effects of the recent float of the Chinese 
currency. Australia's trade minister, Peter Cook, and the 
primary industries minister, Bob Collins, say although the 
decision is subject to review in 12 months, it is a constructive 
development they say will help maintain wool's position as a 
textile in China. China also decided last November to reduce 
from 20 to 15 percent its tariff on wool tops. Australia has 
actively lobbied China on wool tariff reductions, including 
representations from Prime Minister Paul Keating during a visit 
to China late last year.

  [Text] Sydney, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Annual iron ore price 
negotiations between Australian iron ore suppliers and Japanese 
steelmakers were deadlocked this week following "a fundamental 
difference in views of the market," an industry source said 
Thursday [20 January]. 
  Australian negotiators are arguing that increased demand in 
other markets for their iron ore should have an effect on 
prices, while Japanese buyers say that a continued downturn in 
sales in 1994 will result in further "substantial" price cuts, 
the source said. 
  "We see that for 1994 the iron ore market is at worst evenly 
balanced" between supply and demand, an industry source said. 
"The Japanese believe that the market is soft. They're 
allowing their own difficult circumstances to color that 
perception," he said. 
  Contending with continued financial difficulties, the 
Japanese steel mills still set the prices, buying some 50 
million metric tons of iron ore from Australia each year. Last 
year they won a 10 percent drop in prices. But Australian 
negotiators believe that China's place in the market must now be 
considered. The Australians believe that China will take up the 
iron ore that the Japanese do not want, leading them to believe 
that there is no room for a price decrease. 
  China is expected to increase its annual purchase of iron 
ore 
from 28 million tons last year to approximately 34 million tons 
in 1994. 
  Australian negotiators believe that the tight supply-demand 
balance in the rest of the world could even justify a slight 
increase in prices. 
  Meanwhile, they are interpreting their Japanese 
counterparts' 
description of a "substantial" cut to mean a 10 percent drop. 
  Australian negotiators are prepared to factor in Japan's 
economic difficulties but are refusing to consider any 
modification while Japan insists on "substantial" cuts, the 
source said. 
  "So, the way forward would be for us to form a common view 
of 
the market," the source said. 
  Negotiations will resume at the end of the month.

  [Text] Australia's annual inflation rate has fallen below 
2 percent to the surprise of many economists and the federal 
government. Belinda Trump reports that the latest consumer 
price index data shows the cost of living rose just 1.9 percent 
in the year to December. 
  [Begin Trump recording] During the December quarter, the 
cost of living rose 0.2 of 1 percent. This brings the annual 
rate down from 2.2 to 1.9 percent -- well below the federal 
government's 3 percent forecast for the financial year and below 
many market predictions. Contributing to today's figures were 
falling mortgage interests and consumer credit charges. These 
were offset by rises in cigarettes, petrol, fruit and vegetable 
prices, local government charges, and the cost of overseas 
travel and accommodation. 
  Of the capital cities, Hobart has the highest cost of living 
increase with a yearly inflation rate of 3.3 percent. Sydney 
has the lowest with an annual rate of 1.3 percent. 
  The federal treasurer, Ralph Willis, says today's 
encouraging 
inflation figures have put to rest, at least for the time being, 
any increase in interest rates. Mr. Willis says economists 
predicting interest rate increases later in the year will have 
to rethink their forecasts. 
  The treasurer says the annual inflation result of 1.9 
percent 
for the year to December will also result in an upward revision 
of economic growth forecasts. Mr. Willis says he will soon 
announce how far the growth prediction will rise beyond the 3 
percent rate set out in the budget. [end recording]

  [Text] Majuro, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Top Marshall Islands 
government officials have criticised what they say is the 
failure of the United States to release information about the 
effects of its nuclear test program here. Officials said they 
believed the lack of data had led to inadequate compensation 
being paid to Marshall Islanders. 
  In the wake of US Department of Energy (DOE) admissions that 
US citizens were used as unwitting guinea pigs for nuclear 
experiments, Foreign Minister Tom Kijiner said Monday that the 
United States had failed to release full information about its 
nuclear test program in the Marshalls. His comments followed a 
recent medical study confirming that the Marshalls had a rate of 
thyroid tumours dramatically higher than in other parts of the 
world. 
  The study indicated health problems were not confined to the 
atolls of Rongelap, Utirik, Bikini and Enewetak, which the 
United States said were the only radiation-exposed areas in the 
Marshalls. 
  During the early 1980s, Marshall Islands negotiators sought 
detailed information about the 66 announced nuclear tests, 
Kijiner said in an interview. 
  "But US officials told us there was no further information 
to 
provide to us," he said, adding that the US statements had 
proved to be false. "The United States wasn't fair to the 
Marshall Islands during the negotiations (of a treaty known as 
the Compact of Free Association between the two nations)." 
  Last month, the DOE released previously classified 
information about the size of a majority of its nuclear tests in 
the Marshalls, information Kijiner said the Marshalls first 
requested more than a year ago. 
  The foreign minister said the United States released only 
selected information during the negotiations on the Compact of 
Free Association so that nuclear compensation would be minimised. 
  Marshall Islanders had brought lawsuits in US courts seeking 
about five billion US dollars in compensation for damages from 
the nuclear tests. 
  The United States provided a 150 million dollar trust fund 
to 
yield about 270 million dollars over 15 years in the compact 
that was negotiated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
  Marshalls Washington ambassador, Wilfred Kendall, said here 
that the matter of US compensation "needs to be revisited." 
  He concurred with Kijiner, saying that "all the details 
(about the nuclear tests) were not on the table during the 
negotiations." 
  Their contention is supported by a leading US congressman, 
California Democrat George Miller who is chairman of the House 
Committee on Natural Resources. 
  In a letter to US President Bill Clinton earlier this month, 
Miller wrote: "This committee has long been concerned that the 
entire story of the testing done in the Marshalls Islands has 
not yet been told and that the health and well-being of a 
significant number of Marshallese may depend on a look at all 
the facts." 
  Miller said some Rongelap islanders, who were engulfed in a 
cloud of radiation from a 1954 hydrogen bomb test at Bikini, 
have charged that they were used as guinea pigs to further US 
understanding of the effects of radiation. 
  "In the light of the recent disclosures regarding actual 
radiation experimentation in the United States during this 
period, that possibility cannot be ignored," he wrote. 
  He called on the Clinton administration to declassify 
information on the nuclear test program in the Marshalls.

  [Text] A bilateral fishing agreement between Vanuatu and 
Taiwan is to be reviewed. The Taiwan-based (Minda) Association, 
which adminsiters Taiwanese vessels fishing in Vanuatu, called 
for the review in protest against the Vanuatu's Supreme Court 
finding a Taiwanese fisherman guilty of breaching Vanuatu 
fishing laws. In its letter to Vanuatu's Fisheries Department, 
the (Minda) Association complained that Vanuatu is much stricter 
than other South Pacific nations in policing its laws. The 
director of National Surveillance Center, John Toleo, says 
fishing management in Vanuatu's exclusive economics zone is very 
important and Vanuatu will continue to police its laws. But 
Capt. Toleo says he will advice (Minda) that Vanuatu will set up 
a committee to review and consider amendments of the 1989 
Agreement.

<F P=106> ["U.S. Conservative Forces Must Give Up Reckless Racket of </F>
Pressure" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- Some conservative 
forces of the United States, slinging mud at the contents of 
agreement at the New York contact between the DPRK and the 
United States at the end of last year, are crying that 
compromise does not deserve welcome and continued pressure must 
be put on North Korea. And some paid media of the United States 
urge the DPRK to accept a special inspection, spreading the 
rumor that it agreed to accept routine and ad hoc inspections at 
the New York contact. 
  This is an act of throwing a wet blanket over the solution 
of the nuclear issue the way of which has been paved with so 
much efforts; it cannot be construed otherwise than a folly of 
those who do not know the essential nature of the nuclear issue 
or the direction of its solution but seek other purpose, says 
NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today. 
  The news analyst notes: 
  The nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula was caused by the 
introduction of nuclear weapons into South Korea by the United 
States. It is also the United States which complicated the 
situation by bringing forward "suspected nuclear development by 
the North". 
  Thus the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is a matter 
to 
be solved between the United States and the DPRK in view of its 
origin and background of its complexity today and the DPRK and 
the United States have the authority to solve it. 
  For the United States to remove the nuclear threat to the 
DPRK and renounce its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK is the 
precondition for a fundamental solution of the nuclear issue 
and a matter of clearing the debt owed by the United States to 
the DPRK down through history. 
  The DPRK agreed with the United States on the matter of 
inspection because we took into account the fact that the U.S. 
side accepted our formula of package deal and proposal for both 
sides to move simultaneously and manifested its willingness to 
discontinue the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises this year 
and hold the third-round DPRK-USA talks. 
  As for the inspection we intend to allow this time, it is an 
inspection needed merely for the guarantee of the continuity of 
safeguards according to the promise we made to the United States 
when we suspended temporarily the effectuation of our 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] for 
the solution of the nuclear issue through negotiations. 
  The conception of the inspection for the continuity of 
safeguards is a new one that originated from our special 
position in the state of temporary stop of the effectuation of 
the withdrawal from NPT. The inspection for the continuity of 
safeguards is, therefore, quite different from the routine and 
ad hoc inspections pursuant to the obligation under the NPT and, 
moreover, the "special inspection" cannot be an object of debate. 
  The DPRK is in a state of temporary suspension of the 
effectuation of its withdrawal from the NPT. Therefore we are 
not under obligation to implement the safeguards agreement like 
a full-fledged signatory. 
  This notwithstanding, the anti-dialogue forces of the United 
States, setting in motion intelligence plotters and paid 
trumpeters, are painting an exaggerated picture of the fact as 
if the U.S. side has made a unilateral compromise and crying 
that the DPRK must be made to undergo the routine and ad hoc 
inspections and "special inspection" of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency first. This is an imprudent act that does not 
hold water. 
  That the rightwing conservative forces of the United States 
are crying for pressure by demanding even the "special 
inspection" cannot be construed otherwise than an attempt to 
bring the situation to a catastrophe by totally driving the DPRK 
out of the NPT. This real intention is to break up the 
DPRK-U.S. talks at any cost and persistently pursue the hostile 
policy to stifle the DPRK. 
  We will counter toughness with toughness and our tough will 
will be manifested more strongly in practice than in word. 
  If the U.S. hard-line conservative forces do not want to 
regret for their act tomorrow, they should act with discretion 
before it is too late.

Fujii opened a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen on Sunday [23 January] with an explanation of Japan's 
current political turmoil. The meeting, which began at 2 P.M., 
is to be followed by a meeting of Bentsen and Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa at the premier's official residence at 4 P.M. 
  Greeting Bentsen at his office in the presence of reporters, 
the finance minister said he recognized that the defeat of the 
government's political reform bills "has caused you concern" and 
said he would explain the matter. The rejection of the bills 
Friday in the House of Councillors is expected to complicate 
Hosokawa's efforts to introduce economic stimulus measures in 
time for a February 11 summit between Hosokawa and President 
Bill Clinton in Washington. 
  Bentsen stopped over in Tokyo on Saturday night on his way 
home from a tour of Russia and Asia. His talks with Hosokawa 
and Fujii are expected to focus on efforts to reach an agreement 
in bilateral trade talks in time for the summit.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States held working-level coordination sessions on the 
North Korean nuclear issue over the weekend as Pyongyang and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are engaged in 
inspection negotiations. 
  Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of State and top 
U.S. 
representative to contacts with North Korea, flew into Seoul on 
Sunday and met with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and other 
South Korean working-level officials. Hubbard accompanied 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on a leg of his Asian trip and 
flew in separately to Seoul to consult on the nuclear issue, 
Ministry officials said. He leaves for Washington on Monday 
afternoon. 
  Pyongyang-IAEA negotiations on resuming inspections are 
dragging on beyond expectations and the two sides are likely to 
meet again sometime soon. 
  If these talks go well and Pyongyang reopens inter-Korean 
dialogue, the United States is expected to hold high-level talks 
with North Korea for comprehensive discussions, including 
relations improvement.

  [Text] The Japanese Government and the auto industrial 
circles have begun to study the possibility of working out a 
voluntary plan aimed at increasing procurement of U.S.-made auto 
parts in connection with the deadlocked Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks on auto and auto parts. This was disclosed by a 
source connected with the Japan-U.S. negotiations on 23 January. 
  The details of this voluntary plan include promotion of the 
"Design-In" Project, according to which American and Japanese 
auto parts makers will join in the new product development from 
the stage of designing; and plan to lay groundwork for 
increasing procurement of U.S.-made auto parts through such 
measures as promotion of joint ventures to be established by 
Japanese and U.S. makers. However, it will probably be all the 
more a tough choice for Japanese makers because they are faced 
with several difficulties such as sluggish sales on the domestic 
market and a continuous drop in their share of the U.S. market. 
  The priority has been given to the negotiations on auto and 
auto parts so that an accord can be reached before the 
Japan-U.S. summit scheduled for 11 February. The United States 
demands that Japan should not only increase its target of 
importing auto parts (in the amount of $19 billion for fiscal 
1994), which was worked out by Japan in January 1992 as the auto 
industrial circles' voluntary plan but also extend this target 
even after fiscal 1995. In fact, the United States demands that 
substantial numerical targets be set. In response, Japan has 
rejected setting targets and sharp confrontations have continued 
between the two countries. The situation now indicates "no 
progress even by an inch has been made in negotiations," (as 
stated by U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten). 
Maintaining that it is impossible to reach an accord before the 
February summit, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' 
Association, Inc. [JAMAI] have begun to suggest a plan to extend 
negotiations until the next summit talks. 
  However, the fact remains that export of auto and auto parts 
accounts for 60 percent of Japan's trade surplus to the United 
States and that the U.S. market is of the greatest importance to 
Japanese makers. Therefore, it is necessary to work out a 
compromise that will satisfy the United States to a certain 
extent. U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce Garten arrived in Japan 
last week for a visit and he has asked all the auto makers for 
their cooperation. Reportedly, he got the impression that 
"Japanese makers have begun to realize the importance of the 
U.S. market and to seek ways to break the deadlock," (according 
to a high-ranking U.S. Government official). Moreover, 
favorable signs of compromise have begun to appear at long last. 
For example, JAMAI Chairman Yutaka Kume expressed at a news 
conference on 20 January positive views about the prospects for 
setting up joint ventures. It is observed that the study of the 
voluntary plan is part of such moves. 
  By preparing conditions for increasing the original target 
of 
$19 billion, Japan's intention lies in concluding the 
"theological argument" over the propriety of setting numerical 
targets so as to proceed to substantial negotiations. However, 
due to the sluggish situation of the auto industry, "it is 
difficult to attain the target of $19 billion," (according to a 
MITI source). Even if the voluntary plan should be worked out, 
there is a strong possibility that the United States will 
threaten Japan with sanctions if the situation unfavorable to 
the United States should continue to exist. Thus, it is expected 
that drastic confrontations may continue between Japan and the 
United States over the interpretation of the issue.

  [Text] The Keidanren [the Federation of Economic 
Organizations of Japan] plans to seek cooperation from economic 
organizations in the United States and European nations in 
issuing a joint statement calling on industrialized nations to 
implement their respective trade policies in line with accords 
that were concluded among negotiating nations at the end of the 
multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round of GATT). 
There have been reports that protectionism has been emerging in 
the United States where the U.S. Government and some members of 
Congress have been exploring ways to revive the Super 301 
provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. In reaction, the 
Keidanren has concluded that as a Japanese economic 
organization, it needs to work to block those U.S. moves toward 
protectionism and to call for the promotion of free trade. The 
Keidanren intends to set up a task force comprised of officials 
from major industries and enter specific consultations with 
economic organizations in the United States and European nations. 
  A plan under study by the Keidanren is that the Keidanren, 
the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) in the United 
States, and the Union des Industries de la Communaute Europeenne 
(UNICE) [Industrial Union of the European Community] will issue 
a joint statement this spring at the earliest. With the Uruguay 
Round accords set to go into effect in mid-1995, there is a fear 
that European nations and the United Stats would take measures 
to slap sanctions against their trade partners based on 
bilateralism in the intervening time. The Keidanren, therefore, 
intends to call on the U.S. and European governments to rule out 
protectionism and adhere to the spirit of the accords.

  [Text] Geneva, Jan. 25 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
appeared at odds Tuesday [25 January] over whether to include 
North Korea, Iraq and 21 other nations in an expanded conference 
on disarmament. The United Nations-backed conference opened 
Tuesday to discuss a total ban on nuclear weapons tests, while 
suggestions of expanding the 37-member conference to 60 divided 
the meeting. 
  John Holum, director of the U.S. Arms Control and 
Disarmament 
Agency, said it would be important for an expanded conference to 
include the nations that are suspected of trying to develop 
nuclear weapons. 
  Japanese Government sources, without specifically mentioning 
North Korea, said Japan cannot agree to allowing into the 
conference nations with which there are problems with the 
inspections of nuclear facilities by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) and problems with executing disarmament 
related treaties. North Korea has repeatedly denied that it is 
attempting to develop an atomic bomb, but its refusal to permit 
IAEA and inter-Korean inspections of its facilities has aroused 
suspicion about its motives. 
  While the U.S. was apparently indicating no objection to 
adding North Korea to the conference, it did indicate that it 
would be opposed to including Iraq, against which the U.S. led a 
multinational coalition against [as received] in the 1991 
Persian Gulf war.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hans Blix, director general of the </F>
International Atomic Energy Agency, by special correspondent 
Romain Franklin in Vienna; date not given: "North Korea's 
Nuclear Program -- the IAEA's Headache" -- first two paragraphs 
are LIBERATION introduction] 
  [Text] International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Official 
Hans Blix explains why Pyongyang's refusal to let inspectors 
check its nuclear sites is a major problem. 
  It has now been a year since North Korea's nuclear ambitions 
sparked a crisis on January 1993, with Pyongyang refusing to let 
IAEA inspectors carry out a "special inspection" of two nuclear 
waste sites. Such an inspection might have provided evidence as 
to the nature of North Korea's nuclear program; North Korea is 
thought to be engaged in a program to manufacture nuclear 
weapons. In March, Pyongyang announced that it was withdrawing 
from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which it had 
signed in 1985, then "suspended" its withdrawal in June, a few 
hours before it was to become effective. The United States has 
been trying since last Summer to convince North Korea's 
Communist regime to rejoin the NPT and to agree to the IAEA's 
requirements. North Korea recontacted the IAEA last week; 
however, the agency said on Thursday that Pyongyang still 
rejected its requirements. The following is an interview with 
IAEA Executive Director Hans Blix. 
  [Franklin] Is North Korea's attitude especially problematic 
for the IAEA as well as with respect to the more general issue 
of non-proliferation? 
  [Blix] I would say that this is the most acute and 
politically most sensitive non-proliferation issue we have to 
deal with. The IAEA has been demanding, unsuccessfully so far, 
that a number of inspections which require additional 
information and site visits be carried out, and the case has 
been referred to the Security Council of the United Nations. 
That the inspection process should be paralyzed in such a 
manner is quite a serious matter. 
  [Franklin] The CIA says that North Korea could be in 
possession of up to 12 kilograms of plutonium, enough to make 
one or two atom bombs. Is that a fact? 
  [Blix] We do not know. The North Koreans have declared 
having extracted minimal amounts of plutonium (from their 
Yongbyon reactor). However, our inspectors have concluded that 
the amount declared was not the whole picture. This could be 
very serious if the amounts involved are substantial. It might 
be possible to get a better idea of such amounts by checking how 
long the nuclear fuel has been in place in the reactor -- 
whether it has been in place since the initial start-up or if it 
has been changed since. 
  [Franklin] What did you hope would come out of the 
inspection of the two sites Pyongyang has made off-limits? 
  [Blix] Evidence or confirmation of plutonium production 
there; there is no guarantee that we will be able to determine 
the amount of plutonium produced, however. 
  [Franklin] If all IAEA requirements are met, will you be in 
a position to guarantee that North Korea is not working on a 
military nuclear program? 
  [Blix] There will always be some uncertainty, all the more 
since inspecting the Yongbyon plant does not in any way rule out 
the existence of other (clandestine) facilities. 
  [Franklin] Is it still possible to hide an underground 
nuclear facility from all current detection techniques? 
  [Blix] That must be no easy task. 
  [Franklin] But it is technically feasible? 
  [Blix] In Iraq, we looked for an underground plant...and 
even though we did not find one, we remain cautious. Never, for 
any country, do we give a 100-percent guarantee that there is no 
clandestine nuclear program in operation. 
  [Franklin] Are the cameras installed by the agency on the 
Yongbyon site still operational? 
  [Blix] None of them is as their film supply is now 
exhausted. 
  [Franklin] Then, is it possible that fissionable materials 
might have been taken out of the reactor in the meantime? 
  [Blix] This cannot be ruled out. 
  [Franklin] The United States, acting under a UN mandate, is 
currently arranging an agreement which would make it possible to 
reinstate the inspection scheme in North Korea. Some people say 
this agreement is too advantageous for North Korea. What are 
your basic requirements? 
  [Blix] We do not intend to carry out any inspection that 
would not be significant, that is, which would not let us 
determine whether fissionable materials have been diverted since 
our previous inspection. The agreement being negotiated would 
be implemented in two phases, at least. First, we ask to be 
allowed to carry out the types of inspections we were performing 
on the seven declared nuclear sites last year. Then we ask for 
a consultation with the North Koreans on the inspection terms 
for the two additional [undeclared] sites. Furthermore, such 
inspections must take place on a regular basis in the future. 
  [Franklin] Does fissionable material smuggling create a new 
danger? 
  [Blix] This is not a very serious problem. We never found 
any enriched uranium when investigating the cases brought to our 
attention by the media. As for plutonium, the amounts involved 
were minimal. Likewise, we never noted a defection by any 
nuclear scientist from the former USSR's military machine. 
  [Franklin] What other dangers may arise? Some of your 
colleagues have referred to the atom bomb as becoming a "poor 
man's weapon..." 
  [Blix] More and more developing countries are reaching the 
technological level needed to separate plutonium or enriched 
uranium. There is a definite overall risk, and what matters is 
retaining the political will to curtail it.

  [Text] Tokyo, January 19 (KNS-KCNA) -- New Year lectures 
have been given in different parts of Japan by the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon). 
  The first vice-chairman of the Chongnyon Central Standing 
Committee, Yi Chin-kyu, gave a lecture on the subject "on the 
current situation surrounding Korea and patriotic work of 
Chongnyon" in Saitama Prefecture on January 16. 
  He said the Democratic People's Republic of Korea won the 
most acute confrontation with the international reactionaries 
last year under the wise guidance of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il. 
  Noting that this would be a historical year of turn, he 
called on Koreans in Japan to participate in the patriotic work 
of Chongnyon with firm confidence and make this year a year of a 
new advance in the history of the movement of Japan-resident 
Koreans.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 25 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu called for a stronger multilateral bonding in the 
Asia-Pacific Tuesday, mobilizing all available regional forums 
like the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and the East 
Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC). 
  Speaking before the Korea-America Friendship Society in a 
dinner speech, Han predicted an end to confrontational division 
of the Korean peninsula by the 21st century. 
  To better facilitate this, the Asia-Pacific region needs to 
strengthen a multilateral cooperation forum and incorporate 
North Korea in this new order, Han said. 
  The region, for example, could embark on security dialogue, 
give APEC a bigger role, and cooperate closely with North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and link it with EAEC, the 
foreign minister said. 
  To prevent NAFTA and EAEC from becoming regional blocs, 
South 
Korea and other mid-economy nations of East Asia should link up 
with both forums in due course, he suggested. 
  "No matter what the situation, South Korea and the United 
States should continue to work to retain and develop world free 
trade order and make APEC which connects North America with East 
Asia the basic framework for the economic order in the 
Asia-Pacific," said Han.

<F P=106> ["Full Text" of speech by U Aung Toe, chairman of the </F>
National Convention Convening Work Committee and chief justice, 
at the plenary session of the National Convention held in the 
President's House compound in Rangoon on 18 January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Mr. Chairman, concerning the 
discussions of the chapters of the constitution, I would like to 
present and explain some matters on the state, the state 
structure, and the head of state chapters. The basic principles 
concerning the chapter entitled The State are: 
  1. Myanmar is a sovereign independent state; 
  2. The state shall be called the Union of Myanmar; 
  3. The sovereign power of the state which stems from the 
citizens shall reside in the entire state; 
  4. The territory of the state is the territory on the day 
the constitution is adopted. 
  These basic principles will be included in the chapter The 
State. Moreover, if there are any other suitable fundamental 
principles to be added, the delegates are encouraged to present 
their suggestions. 
  Mr. Chairman, the basic principles concerning the chapter 
State Structure are: 
  1. The state shall be established as a union system; 
  2. The existing seven divisions shall be prescribed as 
seven regions [preceding word in English] and the existing seven 
states will remain as states [preceding word in English]. The 
said seven regions and seven states are equal in status; 
  3. The seven regions and seven states shall retain their 
current names; 
  4. If a region or a state wishes to change its name, a 
law shall be promulgated on a name change after the wishes of 
the citizens of the region or state concerned are obtained; 
  5. Self-administered areas [three preceding words in 
English] are to be prescribed for national races other than 
those who already have state status as either a region or state, 
if they have the appropriate population and have existed as a 
united group in a continuous territory; 
  6. Self-administered divisions [three preceding words in 
English] or self-administered zones [three preceding words in 
English] shall be prescribed as appropriate based on the 
population and the extent of the territory, and the state shall 
form a commission to prescribe such divisions and zones; 
  7. The territory of the state in the regions, states, and 
self- administered areas shall never secede from the state. 
  These fundamental principles constitute the main essence 
concerning the state constitution. In discussing the chapter 
State Structure, if any other suitable detailed principles lying 
within the fundamental principles are to be added, the delegates 
should present their suggestions. 
  Mr. Chairman: In the principles concerning state structure 
it has been prescribed that the existing seven divisions will be 
prescribed as seven regions and the existing seven states will 
remain as states. The said seven regions and seven states are 
equal in status. The seven regions and seven states will retain 
their current names. In accordance with the basic principles, a 
fundamental principle should be adopted in naming the regions 
and the states as follows; 
  1. The state is divided into seven regions [preceding word 
in English] and seven states [preceding word in English]: 
Kachin State, Kayah State, Karen State, Chin State, Sagaing 
Region, Tenasserim Region, Pegu Region, Magwe Region, Mandalay 
Region, Mon State, Arakan State, Rangoon Region, Shan State, and 
Irrawaddy Region. 
  2. The various regions and states are equal in status. 
  Mr. Chairman: Regarding the principles concerning state 
structure that I presented earlier, the following fundamental 
principles for self-administered areas have been prescribed; 
  Self-administered areas [three preceding words in English] 
are to be prescribed for national races other than those who 
already have state status as either a region or state, if they 
have the appropriate population and have existed as a united 
group in a continuous territory; 
  Self-administered divisions [three preceding words rendered 
in English] or self-administered zones [three preceding words 
rendered in English] will be prescribed as appropriate based on 
the population and the extent of the territory and the state 
shall form a commission to prescribe such divisions and zones. 
  Mr. Chairman: In accordance with the prescribed fundamental 
principles on self-administered divisions and self-administered 
zones, conditions exist for the formation of such divisions and 
zones. In the regions and states, there are national races 
other than those who already have state status as either a 
region or state. Some national races have the appropriate 
population and have existed as a united group in a continuous 
territory. The national convention has already adopted a 
fundamental principle prescribing self-administered divisions or 
self-administered zones as appropriate for those national races 
based on the population and the extent of the territory. 
  Mr. Chairman: The national convention delegates should 
present suggestions on how to determine the self-administered 
divisions and self-administered zones. Since the 
self-administered divisions will have the legislative, 
administrative, and judicial powers in accordance with the 
constitution, they should include districts and townships. 
Although the status of a self-administered division is not as 
high as a region or state, it is higher than the districts from 
the regions or states. A self-administered zone should be 
prescribed for the national races that have resided in unity in 
that zone. A fundamental principle that the state should form a 
commission has been adopted to determine a self-administered 
division or a self-administered zone, if conditions exist, and 
the formation of a commission concerns procedural matters. The 
intention for brother national races to quickly receive due 
privileges is unanimous in the minds of convention delegates. 
Instead of the state forming a commission to determine which 
deserving national races should be granted either 
self-administered divisions or self-administered zones and to 
determine the places and zones, it will delight the concerned 
national races and will further strengthen national unity if the 
delegates prescribe them after discussions and deliberations. 
The delegates should present their proposals on whether it is 
feasible to prescribe outright the self- administered divisions 
or self-administered zones for national races other than those 
who already have either a region or state that meet all the 
requirements of the fundamental principles. 
  Mr. Chairman: There will be a need to prescribe the basic 
principle for the chapter on state structure for the structure 
of the Union of Myanmar including the self-administered 
divisions or self-administered areas. In accordance with the 
1974 constitution, villages are combined into village tracts; 
wards are classed together as towns; village tracts, wards, and 
towns are put together as townships; townships are combined into 
divisions or states; and divisions and states are organized as 
the state. Since the State Law and Order Restoration Council 
[SLORC] took the responsibilities of the country, there are ward 
and village level, township level, district level, and state or 
division level state organizations for easy and speedy 
communications and effective administration. A fundamental 
principle should be prescribed regarding state structure where 
villages are combined into village tracts; wards are classed 
together as a town or township; village tracts, wards or towns 
are put together as a township; townships are combined into a 
district; districts are organized into a region or a state; in a 
self-administered zone, self-administered townships are combined 
as a self-administered zone; in a self-administered division, 
self-administered townships are combined as a district and these 
districts are organized as a self-administered division; if 
there is a self-administered division or self-administered zone 
in a region or state, the self-administered division or 
self-administered zone and the districts are organized as a 
region or a state; and the regions and states are organized as 
the state. The basic principle on territory of the state in the 
regions, states, and self- administered areas will never secede 
from the state has already been adopted and these must be 
presented in the chapter concerning state structure. 
  Mr. Chairman: The fundamental principles to be prescribed 
in the chapter on state structure are: 
  1. How will it be done when the need arises to change the 
national territorial boundary? 
  2. How will it be done when the need arises to change a 
region or state boundary? 
  3. How will it be done when the need arises to change or 
form boundaries, or change the name of a village, village tract, 
ward, town, and township in a region, state, self-administered 
division, or self-administered zone? 
  These must also be put into consideration and discussed. 
Delegates should present suggestions in view of the country's 
benefit, on how to solve above mentioned boundary matters if the 
need arises. The National Convention Convening Work Committee 
[NCCWC] based on the overall study would like to present some 
suggestions. 
  Mr. Chairman: If the need arises to solve boundary matters 
in view of the country's benefit, suggestions will also include 
some legislative matters. So, some principles concerning 
legislative affairs will also be included in the suggestions. 
In prescribing fundamental principles for legislature, there 
will be a bicameral Union Parliament with one elected chamber 
based on population representation and another chamber with 
equal representation from the regions and the states. There 
will also be persons to head those parliaments. 
  Mr. Chairman: When the need arises to change the national 
territorial boundary, the president should first inform the head 
of the Union Parliament to get the approval of the Union 
Parliament. The Union Parliament should then take the vote of 
the members of parliament as follows to change the national 
territorial boundary: 
  1. More than half the vote of representatives of the 
parliament made up of equal number of representatives from 
regions and states; 
  2. More than half the vote of representatives of the 
[Union] parliament elected on the basis of population; 
  3. More than half the vote of representatives of the two 
parliaments in the concerned region or state. 
  The convention is to discuss and suggest on whether a basic 
principle should be prescribed to enable the president to alter 
the national territorial boundary after receiving the stipulated 
support vote. If either one of the parliaments or 
representatives of the two parliaments in the concerned region 
or state decide to disagree to change the national territorial 
boundary according to the methods mentioned above, the president 
can change the national territorial boundary if the matter 
received more than three fourth of the vote in the Union 
Parliament. The convention is to discuss whether such a basic 
principle should be prescribed. 
  Mr. Chairman: I will explain measures to be taken when it 
becomes necessary to alter the territorial boundary of a region 
or a state. When the need arises to change the territorial 
boundary of a region or a state, the consent of the voters 
residing in the region or state should first be obtained. The 
changing of territorial boundary is not to be carried out if it 
does not receive more than half of the vote of the eligible 
voters in the concerned region. If more than half of the voters 
vote to change the territorial boundary, the vote of the 
representatives of the region or state concerned is to be 
obtained. If more than three-fourths of the vote of the 
representatives of the region or state concerned vote to change 
the territorial boundary of a region or a state, the president, 
with the consent of the Union Parliament, can change the 
territorial boundary of a region or state. The convention is to 
discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed. If 
either the regional or state parliament decide to disagree to 
change the boundary, the decision of the Union Parliament should 
be obtained. If more than three-fourths of the total 
representatives of the Union Parliament vote to change the 
boundary of a region or a state, the president can change the 
territorial boundary of a region or state. The convention is to 
discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed. 
  Mr. Chairman: There is an indication for reasons to appear 
to change or form boundaries, or change the name of a village, 
village tract, ward, town, township, and district in a region, 
state, self-administered division, or self-administered zone. 
The convention should present suggestions on how to act when 
the need arises for such a change. This matter to change or 
form boundaries, or a name change, is solely a regional concern. 
If a need occurs, the administrative authority of the region or 
state concern should recommend to the president and the 
president should take action as needed. The convention is to 
discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed. 
  Mr. Chairman: A basic principle has been adopted if the need 
arises to change the name of a region or state by passing 
legislation with the consent of the citizens residing in the 
region or state. This basic principle should be included and 
prescribed in the chapter concerning state structure. The 
convention is to discuss whether a basic principle should be 
prescribed if the need arises to change legislation of 
self-administered divisions or self- administered zones by using 
similar methods as outlined above. 
  Mr. Chairman: During the panel discussions by national 
convention delegate groups, a delegate group suggested a basic 
principle that the state capital be put under a separate 
administrative zone and not under the administration of a region 
or a state. This suggestion should be seriously considered in 
the discussions concerning the chapter on state structure. 
Since the basic principle has been adopted regarding the seven 
regions and seven states in the state structure, if the state 
capital is to be considered as a separate administrative union 
zone, then there is a need for it to be included in the basic 
principles. Although matters relating to the state capital are 
to be discussed in the state flag, state seal, national anthem, 
and state capital chapter, there is a need to discuss it in the 
chapter on state structure. According to international practice, 
the seat of the central government is considered as the state 
capital and in some countries, those capitals are directly 
governed by either the president or the central government. In 
Myanmar [Burma], if Yangon [Rangoon], where the central 
government resides, is considered as the state capital, the 
delegates should discuss and decide whether to adopt a basic 
principle to have the administration of the state capital, 
Yangon, directly under the president as a union zone rather than 
having it under the administration of the Yangon Region. If the 
administration of the state capital, Yangon, is put directly 
under the administration of the president, then there will be 
basic principles to be discussed in the concerned chapters on 
legislative, administrative, and judicial powers regarding the 
capital, Yangon. Moreover, special places like the Cocos Islands 
Township should be considered as union zones and should be put 
under the direct control of the president. The convention is to 
discuss whether such a basic principle should be prescribed. In 
future, zones with special conditions concerning state defense 
and security, administration, and economics, should by 
legislation be put under the direct supervision of the president 
and should be considered as union zones. The convention is also 
to discuss whether such a principle should be adopted. 
  Mr. Chairman: I have presented detailed explanations of 
basic principles on the chapters on the state and the state 
structure. Continuing, I would like to present the basic 
principles on the chapter on the Head of State as prescribed by 
the National Convention Plenary Session. They are: 
  1. The president is the head of state; 
  2. The president will be elected through the Electoral 
College. 
  Based on the prescribed principle that the president is the 
head of state, detailed discussions on the status, qualities, 
duties, responsibilities, election by electoral college, term of 
presidency, and (?accusations and blame), should be made whether 
such principles should be prescribed. Based on the prescribed 
principle that the president will be elected through the 
Electoral College, detailed discussions should be made on the 
formation of the electoral college, who should be included, and 
how the president should be elected, whether such principles 
should be prescribed. I will continue to present some points 
for discussions concerning the president. 
  Mr. Chairman: The president, who is the head of state, is a 
figurehead in some countries while he is just an administrative 
head in others. In accordance with the basic principles 
concerning the head of state, the state president of our country 
will have full administrative powers. The state president, who 
is like a shining star for the country, should also be a 
national leader whom the people rely upon. There is a need to 
fully and precisely specify the qualifications of the president 
to elect the person who is going to take a very important 
position in the country. That is why, apart from prescribing 
the basic principle that the president is the head of state, the 
convention is also to discuss whether principles should be 
adopted on the president representing the state, the president 
as the national leader of all national races, and the president 
assuming the paramount position of all national races in the 
entire Union of Myanmar. Next, I would like to present some 
suggestions regarding the qualifications of the president. 
Since the state president is a national leader, the president 
should be the person who can diligently work for the 
nondisintegration of the union, nondisintegration of national 
solidarity, perpetuation of national sovereignty, and the 
wellbeing and development of the country. The president should 
also be well versed in state matters like politics, 
administration, economics, and military and be able to make 
experienced, effective, and concise decisions. Therefore, the 
basic qualifications of the president should be prescribed as 
another basic principle. Moreover, the president, who will be 
leading the country, should be especially loyal to the state and 
the people. Thus, another basic principle should be adopted 
citing the president to be loyal to the country and the people. 
  Mr. Chairman: Studies show that constitutions of most 
countries clearly state that the person who is to be president 
should be born of two parents who are citizens of that country. 
The Constitution of the United States of America requires that 
the U.S. president be born to two parents who are U.S. citizens, 
must attain a minimum age of 35 years, and reside in the United 
States for at least 14 years. 
  The Constitution of the Philippines states that those 
running election as president of the Philippines should be a 
Philippine citizen born of two parents who are Philippine 
citizens. The Constitution of Indonesia that those running for 
election as president of Indonesia should be an Indonesian 
citizen born of two parents who are Indonesian citizens. 
  Mr. Chairman: The constitutions of some countries clearly 
state that the place of birth of the person running for 
president should be within the concerned country. In our 
country, too, the basic principle on the citizenship of the 
president should be adopted such that the person running for 
president and their parents should be citizens born within the 
legal boundaries of the country. Regarding age limits of 
presidents, the Constitution of Bangladesh stipulates that the 
minimum age of the president should be 35 years old, according 
to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China the 
president should be more than 45 years old, according to the 
Constitution of Egypt the age of the president should not be 
less than 40 years old, the Constitution of India stipulates 
that the president must be older than 35 years, and the 
Constitution of Pakistan requires the president to be at least 
45 years old. 
  The president should have rich experience in the political, 
adminsitrative, economic, and military affairs of the country. 
The person elected as president should be at least 45 years 
old. Therefore, the delegates are to discuss whether to lay down 
a basic principle prescribing that the president should be at 
least 45 years old. Furthermore, in addition to meeting the 
requirements for running in the parliamentary elections, the 
president should meet separate qualifications set for the 
president. Similar provisions can bee seen in the state 
constitutions of Bangladesh, the PRC, India, Pakistan, the 
Philippines, and Sri Lanka. 
  Article 49-B of the 1947 State Constitution of the Union of 
Myanmar stipulates that no person is be eligible for election to 
the office of president unless he or she is qualified for 
election to the Parliament. Therefore, discussions should be 
held to prescribe separate qualifications in addition to 
qualifications for contesting in parliamentary elections. 
  The constitutions of some countries contain provisions on 
continuous length of residence in the country. As the president 
is the national leader and the head of state, it is necessary 
for the president to be well-informed on political, 
administrative, economic, social, and indigenous national 
affairs to provide effective leadership to the nation. 
Therefore, a basic rule should be made to stipulate that the 
president should have continuous residence for at least 20 years 
prior to the time of election as president. 
  Mr. Chairman: Myanmar was under the servitude of the British 
imperialists for over 100 years because of traitors, and the 
people suffered a bitter experience. Furthermore, there were 
instances after independence when the nation's independence and 
sovereignty were almost lost because of these traitors and the 
Defense Services had to defend the nation in time. Therefore, 
the president, who is to serve as the national leader and the 
head of state, should have allegiance to the nation and 
citizens. To ensure that the people have full trust in the 
president without any suspicion, it is especially necessary for 
members of the president's family to have allegiance to the 
nation and citizens. Therefore, the president himself, one of 
the president's parents, the spouse of the president, any one of 
the president's legal children, and the spouse of any one of the 
president's children must not owe allegiance to a foreign power, 
not be the subject of a foreign power nor be a foreign citizen. 
Especially, they must not be entitled to the rights and 
privileges of a subject of a foreign power or foreign citizen. 
  Mr. Chairman: Section 1-A of Article 74 of the 1947 State 
Constitution contains the provision to prevent foreign 
interference in our internal affairs. It states that any person 
who is under any acknowledgment of allegiance or adherence to a 
foreign power, or is a subject or citizen or entitled to the 
rights and privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign 
power shall be disqualified for being chosen as and for being a 
member of either chamber of Parliament. Similar provision is 
included in Article 10-E of the 1989 Parliamentary Election Law. 
  Therefore, a basic principle should be laid down on 
qualifications for the president as I have presented above. 
Other qualifications can be also added. 
  Mr. Chairman: All tasks, other than legislative and 
judicial affairs, concern administration. The president is to 
carry the heavy burden as the national leader, head of state, 
and chief executive. A basic principle has been laid down to 
elect the president through an electoral college. Therefore, 
discussions should be held on organization of the electoral 
college and procedure for electing the president. 
  It is found that when an electoral college is formed the 
country's history, political affairs, and other conditions are 
taken into consideration. Among the countries that practised 
the election of a president through an electoral college are the 
United States, Indonesia, India, and Pakistan. These countries 
elect their presidents through the electoral college, which was 
formed under the constitution according to the concrete 
conditions in their countries. 
  Mr. Chairman: We are to elect a president according to our 
country's course of history and political and other conditions 
and the six objectives of the National Convention. The 
electoral college does not have to be elected separately, but it 
can be prescribed that all members of the Union Parliament are 
members of the electoral college, which should be divided into 
three groups. The first group will be formed with 
representatives of the parliament made up of equal number of 
representatives from regions and states. The second group will 
be formed with representatives of the parliament elected on the 
basis of population. The third group will be formed with 
representatives from the Defense Services from the two 
parliaments mentioned above and who are nominated by the 
commander in chief of the Defense Services. 
  As our president will be a national leader as well as the 
chief executive, the responsibility of the president is huge. 
Many countries elect deputy chief executives to assist the 
chief executive in his work. Likewise, we should appoint vice 
presidents to assist the president in our country. Therefore, 
the three groups in charge of electing the president should 
first select vice presidents from among the members of 
parliament or those who are not members of parliament. 
  The vice president is a potential president. Therefore, a 
body composed of the heads and deputy heads of the Union 
Parliament and the two parliaments will clear candidates to see 
if they meet the qualifications set for president. Members of 
the electoral college or members of the Union Parliament are to 
cast a vote to elect the president out of the three vice 
presidents. The person who receives the most votes becomes the 
president. Suggestions should be made on whether this method 
should be adopted. 
  If this system is practiced, we will have a president and 
two 
vice presidents in our country, and they will be able to 
effectively carry out their duties. It will be also necessary 
to lay down a basic principle to enact a law necessary for 
election of the president. 
  After the president and vice presidents are elected, matters 
concerning these persons, such as tenure of office, oath of 
allegiance, salary and privileges, responsibilities, liaison 
with the Union Parliament, and impeachment of president and vice 
presidents should be considered. 
  Mr. Chairman: Our country plans to practice the 
administrative system with president as chief executive. Hence, 
it will be necessary to stipulate the suitable term of office 
for the president and vice presidents to enable them to 
discharge their duties effectively. Limitations on terms of 
office should be also considered. 
  I would like to present constitutional provisions in some 
countries that stipulate limitations on term of office for the 
president. Under the PRC Constitution, the term of office for 
the president is five years and only two consecutive terms of 
office are allowed. The term of office for president in Egypt 
is six years, and there is no limit for right to reelection. 
The term of office for president in Indonesia is five years, 
and there is no limite for right to reelection. The term of 
office for president in India is five years, and there is no 
stipulation on reelection. The term of office for president in 
Pakistan is five years, and there is no more than two 
consecutive terms of office. The term of office for president 
in the Philippines is six years, and reelection is not allowed. 
The term of office for president in Sri Lanka is six years, and 
the term of office is limited to two consecutive terms. The 
term of office for president in the U.S. is four years, and 
reelection is limited to two terms. We are to consider the 
suitable term of office for the presidency in our country. 
  We are to work very hard for the country's economic, 
administrative, and social affairs to catch up with other 
countries. Therefore, term of office of president and vice 
presidents should be five years to allow time to carry out the 
tasks that benefit the nation and the people. Discussions 
should be held to consider whether a basic principle should be 
laid to allow the president and vice presidents to serve until 
the new president is elected and to limit the term of presidency 
to two terms. 
  Furthermore, discussions should be held to consider whether 
to lay down a basic principle stipulating that the person 
replacing the vacant position of the president or vice president 
is to serve until the end of the original term of office. 
  Mr. Chairman, I have already explained the election of the 
president and vice presidents by the electoral college, as well 
as the requirements for the offices of president and vice 
president. One point should be taken into consideration in 
electing a member of parliament as president or vice president: 
the convention put forward a principle on the separation of 
executive, legislative, and judicial powers. Therefore, if a 
member of parliament were to be elected president or vice 
president by the electoral college, it would contravene the 
principle of separation of the three state powers. Furthermore, 
the president and vice presidents are national leaders who 
should work for the national interest rather than political 
parties. They should not have to be involved in the affairs of 
their political party. 
  Section 1, Article 47 of the 1947 Constitution states that 
the president cannot be a member of either chamber of 
parliament. Section 2 states that if a member of either chamber 
of parliament is elected president, they will be deemed to have 
vacated their seat in that chamber. Therefore, neither the 
president nor the vice presidents will be members of parliament. 
If the president or vice presidents are either members of 
parliament or public servants, they will be deemed to have 
resigned or retired from that position upon the date of their 
election to office. If the president or vice presidents are 
members of a political party, they will cease their involvement 
in the affairs of that political party upon their election to 
office. A basic principle to this effect will have to be 
discussed. 
  Mr. Chairman, the president and vice presidents have to take 
the oath of office before assuming their positions. The 
president and vice presidents can only perform their duties 
after they have been sworn in before the members of the Union 
Parliament. Constitutions usually contain provisions on how the 
oath of office will be administered to the president and vice 
presidents. Therefore, discussions should be held and 
suggestions presented regarding the oath of office for the 
president and vice presidents. 
  The president and vice presidents have to shoulder the heavy 
burdens of the state. As such, they wield power. There should 
be a prohibition against organizations influencing the president 
or vice presidents by giving them salaries or positions. 
Therefore, discussions should be held on whether there should 
be a basic principle forbidding the president and vice 
presidents from accepting salaries and positions from outside 
organizations. 
  Mr. Chairman, the president is fully empowered as chief 
executive. The vice presidents will have to discharge heavy 
duties. As such, they should have the respect of the people. 
Discussions should be held on a basic principle requiring the 
president and vice presidents to declare their family assets -- 
such as land, houses, buildings, economic enterprises, savings, 
and other valuables -- to the head of the Union Parliament. 
  The president and vice presidents should be entitled to 
salaries, allowances, and privileges as prescribed by law. 
Furthermore, they should have appropriate official residences. 
Therefore, discussions should be held on whether to lay down a 
basic principle outlining the salary, allowances, privileges, 
and official residences of president and vice presidents. 
  The rights and responsibilities of the president and vice 
presidents will be included in the constitutional provisions and 
other laws. Therefore, a basic principle should be laid down on 
the rights and responsibilities prescribed by the constitution 
and other laws for the president and vice presidents. 
  Mr. Chairman, so far I have explained the election of the 
president and vice presidents as well as some of the president's 
responsibilities. 
  Although executive, legislative, and judicial powers will be 
exercised separately, there should be legal provisions for 
checks and balances. It is necessary for the president -- who 
is the chief executive -- and the vice presidents to conduct 
themselves in a manner befitting their positions. Basic 
principles should be laid down for impeachment procedures 
against the president and vice presidents if they commit a 
breach of conduct. 
  Under the U.S. Constitution, the president and vice 
president 
can be impeached for betraying their country, corruption, and 
other serious offenses, as well as a breach of conduct. The 
Bangladesh Constitution provides for the impeachment of the 
president for violating the Constitution or misconduct. 
Impeachment requires that a minimum of three quarters of the 
signatures of the members of parliament be submitted to the 
parliamentary president. The Egyptian Constitution provides for 
an impeachment motion against the president for betraying the 
country or any other offense. Such a motion requires the 
support of a minimum of one third of the members of parliament. 
Impeachment cannot proceed if the motion is not approved by two 
thirds of the members of parliament. 
  Discussions should be held on laying down a basic principle 
providing for the impeachment of our president and vice 
presidents for any of the following offenses: betraying the 
country; violating constitutional provisions; or misconduct. 
  Procedures for impeaching the president and vice presidents 
should also be considered. In order to bring impeach 
proceedings against the president or vice presidents for one or 
all of the offenses I have mentioned, the signatures of at least 
one quarter of the members of one of the chambers of the Union 
Parliament must be obtained and submitted to the head of the 
parliamentary chamber concerned. The impeachment procedure can 
continue only if it is supported by at least two-thirds of the 
members of the parliamentary chamber concerned. An impeachment 
motion submitted by one parliamentary chamber will be 
investigated by a team from the other. The president, vice 
presidents, or their representatives will have the right to make 
a defense. 
  Once the charges have been investigated, if at least 
two-thirds of the members of the parliamentary chamber that 
investigated the charges or that caused the investigation decide 
that the charges are correct and that the offense makes the 
president or vice president unsuitable to carry out their 
duties, the parliamentary chamber will make a submission to the 
head of the Union Parliament to terminate the accused president 
or vice president's term of office. As soon as the submission 
is received, the head of the Union Parliament will announce the 
accused president or vice president's termination from office. 
Basic principles to this effect should be discussed. 
  The president and vice presidents are national leaders as 
well as heads of state. Other than impeachment conducted 
according to constitutional provisions, the president and vice 
presidents should be protected from being sued during their 
terms of office. Only if such protection is given will the 
president and vice presidents be able to discharge their duties 
courageously. Therefore, other than the president and vice 
presidents being impeached according to constitutional 
provisions, they should be protected from being sued during 
their terms of office, and a basic principle to that effect 
should be discussed. 
  Mr. Chairman, the president and vice presidents should be 
allowed to resign before their term of office expires if they so 
wish. A basic principle should be laid down to deal with a 
situation whereby the presidency becomes vacant because the 
president resigns from office, dies, becomes permanently 
disabled, or any other reason before the term of office expires. 
If the presidency becomes vacant, an acting president should be 
chosen to continue the work of the president. The acting 
president should be whichever one of the two vice presidents 
received the second highest number of votes in the presidential 
elections. 
  If there is a vacancy in the presidency, a new president 
will 
need to be elected. If a vacancy develops while the Union 
Parliament is in session, the acting president should inform the 
head of the Union Parliament as soon as possible so that the 
vacancy can be filled within seven days. When this information 
is received, the head of the Union Parliament should take the 
necessary steps for the electoral panel to choose a new vice 
president. When the respective electoral panel has chosen a new 
vice president, the Union Parliament members should elect a new 
president as they see fit from among the three vice presidents. 
If a vacancy arises when the Union Parliament is not in 
session, the head of the Union Parliament should convene a 
special parliamentary session within 21 days of receiving the 
information from the acting president and carry out the 
above-mentioned process of choosing a new president. Therefore, 
appropriate discussions should be held by the delegates to lay 
down a basic principle on the election of a new president when a 
vacancy arises. 
  Mr. Chairman, I would like to make some basic suggestions on 
electing a new vice president if a vacancy occurs because one of 
the vice presidents resigns from office, dies, is removed from 
office before their term of office expires, becomes permanently 
disabled, or any other reason. If the position of vice 
president becomes vacant while the Union Parliament is in 
session, the president should inform the head of the Union 
Parliament as soon as possible so the electoral panel can fill 
the vacant office within seven days. If a vacancy arises when 
the Union Parliament is not in session, the head of the Union 
Parliament should convene a special parliamentary session within 
21 days of receiving the information from the president, so that 
the electoral panel can elect a new vice president. Thus, the 
delegates should deliberate on whether to prescribe a basic 
principle on the election of a new vice president if a vacancy 
arises. 
  Mr. Chairman and National Convention delegates, the 
presentations I have made on the chapters concerning the state, 
the structure of the state, and the head of state are just some 
suggestions for the delegates to consider in trying to prescribe 
the basic principles. When presenting suggestions for adoption 
as basic principles, the delegates should present them 
separately in accordance with their respective chapter headings, 
just as I have done. I have presented some abstracts of the 
facts the National Convention Convening Work Committee studied 
concerning the chapters on the state, the structure of the 
state, and the head of state, so that the delegates will have a 
wider scope in their discussions on proposing basic principles. 
If there are any suitable and appropriate additions to be made, 
the National Convention delegates should do so in accordance 
with the six National Convention objectives, the 
previously-prescribed basic principles, and the National 
Convention convening procedures. The National Convention 
delegate groups, after studying my suggestions, will begin panel 
discussions on 21 January regarding the chapters on the state, 
the structure of the state, and the head of state. It is 
requested that they present a paper compiling their 
chapter-by-chapter suggestions to the work committee in 
accordance with the National Convention convening procedures. 
  I thus conclude my address. [applause]

<F P=106> [by Bertil Lintner in Chiang Mai; quotations marks as </F>
received] 
  [Text] A semblance of peace may be returning to Burma 
after years of civil war, but it is increasingly apparent that 
the chief beneficiary of the cessation in hostilities will be 
the ruling military junta in Rangoon rather than the ethnic 
rebels it has been battling. 
  In October last year, Burma's biggest ethnic rebel group, 
the 
Kachin Independence Army, made peace with the junta, or State 
Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), and now the Karens, 
the Mons and the Karennis along the Thai border have begun talks 
with the central government. 
  The junta has benefited from being able to negotiate 
separate 
peace treaties with each rebel group, a process that also 
resulted in the increasing marginalisation of Burman 
pro-democracy groups who sought refuge in rebel strongholds. 
While the patchwork peace process will probably result in a 
cessation of hostilities for the time being, analysts say 
fundamental differences between the Slorc and the rebels must 
still be resolved before any long-term solution can be reached. 
  "There's a fundamental difference between the Slorc's 
perception of how to solve the ethnic issue and what the 
minorities themselves have been demanding throughout the years 
of civil war," a Rangoon-based analyst told the REVIEW. "The 
minorities and their Burma allies in the DAB (Democratic 
Alliance of Burma) are basically advocating a modified version 
of the federal system that existed before (the first military 
coup in) 1962. 
  The Slorc, on the other hand, wants a system similar to 
China's -- let the minorities do what they want within their 
respective areas as long as they don't interfere with national 
politics. Bring them to the capital dressed up in their 
colourful costumes to attend conventions and congresses, but 
don't let them have a say in the running of the country as a 
whole." 
  Rangoon's actions so far lend credence to this analysis. 
When the first talks were held with the Kachins in the border 
town of Panghsai near China in late 1991, the government 
representative, Col. Kyaw Thein of the powerful intelligence 
apparatus, stated clearly that he wanted a separate deal with 
the Kachins only. He also referred to the Burman members of the 
DAB -- various pro- democracy groups, student organisations and 
an association of dissident Buddhist monks -- as "a nuisance," 
indicating that they would not be part of the peace plan. 
  "It's the pro-democracy movement that is the main enemy. The 
strategy is to neutralise the ethnic groups in order to 
eliminate what's left of the Burman opposition," another analyst 
in Bangkok said. 
  If that is indeed the government's goal, it is succeeding. 
Since late 1990, the Karen headquarters at Manerplaw has also 
been the main base not only for dissident students, but also for 
fugitive MPs, who were elected in May of that year but prevented 
from assuming office, as well as numerous activists from what 
was Burma's main prodemocracy party, the National League for 
Democracy. 
  A number of recent events have effectively separated the 
Burman opposition from the ethnic rebels at Manerplaw. The 
current peace talks -- which the Burman dissidents are opposing 
-- are only one example. In September last year, five leading 
Burman activists left Manerplaw to travel to the United States 
to lobby at the United Nations. They have been barred from 
entering Thailand by security authorities in Bangkok, whose 
connivance they would need to return to Manerplaw. 
  Thai participation in brokering the peace talks is evident 
also in the pressure that has been placed on the ethnic rebels 
to negotiate with Rangoon. The Mons were the first group along 
the Thai border to strike a deal with the Slorc in late 
December. The Karennis, who are closely related to the Karens, 
met government representatives in their area in early January. 
A meeting in the border areas also reportedly took place at 
about the same time between the Karen rebel leader, Gen. Bo 
Mya, and Lieut.-Col. Thein Swe, the Burmese defence attache in 
Bangkok. 
  Originally, the DAB's stated policy was not to talk to 
Rangoon's representatives individually but to insist on a 
political settlement that included the entire front. Under Thai 
pressure, this policy now appears to have been abandoned. "But 
even worse is that the ethnic groups lack any kind of 
coordination. They're entering into these talks just to see 
what the Slorc has to offer, not with a comprehensive, 
coordinated agenda," a source close to the ethnic rebels said.

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 22 Jan 94 Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] With the political reform bills having been 
rejected by the House of Councillors, the outlook for the 
Japan-U.S. summit on 21 February, as well as for the ongoing 
Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, looks uncertain. A 
vice-ministerial-level meeting is set for 23 January in 
Washington to discuss government procurements and other matters, 
but negotiations in all sectors are experiencing very rough 
sailing over issues like U.S. demands for numerical targets. 
  Meanwhile, regarding to the impact which the current 
political chaos will have on the talks, there are now two 
contrasting views emerging within the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs [MOFA] -- one predicts "the United States will push 
hard, becoming despaired of the Hosokawa government," and the 
other says "they will soften their position out of consideration 
for the chaotic political situation in Japan." 
  The United States is now beginning to show irritation over 
the negotiations which are making slow progress. Secretary of 
Treasury Lloyd Bentsen will arrive in Japan on 23 January. U.S. 
Trade Representative Micky Kantor has expressed his intention to 
visit Japan. The country is calling on Japan to make a 
political decision to reach a breakthrough in the talks. 
  Meanwhile Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade 
and industry, insists "there is no discrepancy in views between 
the government and bureaucrats." But according to a senior MOFA 
official, there are increasing views in Japan that because of 
the problem raised by the political reform issue, "it is now 
possible Japan's political alternatives will narrow." 
  An official of the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry was perplexed, saying: "If revised political reform 
bills are promptly adopted, there will be no major impact on the 
negotiations. But if this situation leads to a weakening of the 
coalition government by the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
breaking up, or leads to the fall of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa from power, there is no telling what will happen to the 
talks."

<F P=106> [By Shegeru Komago in Washington; from Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI </F>
SHIMBUN in Japanese 24 January Morning Edition] 
  [Text] The U.S. Government will probably send very 
high-ranking officials, including Chairwoman Laura Tyson of the 
president's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), to the vice 
ministerial level plenary meeting of the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks opening in Washington this week. It intends to 
make an all-out effort to "gather information" on the tumultuous 
political situation in Japan after the political reform bills 
were rejected by the House of Councillors on 21 January]. As 
early adoption of "economic stimulation measures, including an 
income tax cut," which the United States had strongly hoped for, 
has become quite improbable, this week's meeting may well decide 
the fate of the Japan-U.S. summit meeting scheduled for February. 
  The vice ministerial level plenary meeting on 24 and 25 
January is supposed to make an interim assessment of the 
framework talks. Regular members on the U.S. side of this 
meeting include Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president 
(concurrently vice chairman of the National Economic Council), 
and vice ministerial level representatives of the Departments of 
Treasury, State and Commerce, and the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative. The Japanese side will be headed by Koichiro 
Matsuura, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs. 
  According to a White House source, aside from Tyson, CEA 
member Blinder [name as published], Deputy Secretary of the 
Treasury Roger C. Altman, and National Intelligence Council 
officer for East Asia Ezra Vogel may also participate in the 
meeting "if time permits." It will be an unusual meeting, with 
all the officials in charge of economic policy and intelligence 
in the Clinton administration attending. 
  Behind this lies U.S. anxiety about the situation. While the 
U.S. Government has expressed its discontent at the lack of 
progress in the framework talks by criticizing Japanese 
bureaucrats, it always felt a final breakthrough could be 
achieved through a political decision by Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. However, with the rejection of the political reform 
bills, the prime minister's leadership has been weakened, and it 
has become difficult to make an early decision on any income tax 
cut, not to mention market liberalization. 
  The U.S. administration, under pressure from Congress, is 
now 
forced to decide between pushing through or postponing a 
Japan-U.S. summit which is unlikely to be fruitful. Therefore, 
following the visit of Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen 
to Japan on short notice to learn about the political situation, 
the United States would again like to assess how effectively 
Japan can respond in the framework talks at this week's meeting. 
  There is concern that if Tyson leads the discussions, there 
will be heated exchanges between Japan and United States at the 
meeting. If the meeting is characterized by confrontation at a 
time when U.S. expectations of the Hosokawa administration are 
being lowered, it could lead to a decisive deterioration in 
Japan-U.S. relations.

  [Text] Sydney, 20 Jan -- On 20 January, an Australian 
Foreign Ministry source told YOMIURI SHIMBUN that the DPRK 
(North Korea) recently contacted Australia in an attempt to 
normalize its ties with Australia and that both countries held 
unofficial meetings in third nations. The Australian Foreign 
Ministry is paying attention to the fact that North Korea has 
contacted Australia while the DPRK's discussions with the United 
States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are 
coming to their final stages. 
  Australia and North Korea established diplomatic ties in 
1974. Relations between the two countries were ruptured because 
North Korea had one-sidedly closed its embassy in Australia and 
deported Australian diplomats from North Korea. 
  According to an Australian Foreign Ministry spokesman and 
diplomatic sources in Australia, North Korea took the initiative 
in contacting Australia and high-level diplomats of both 
countries held meetings at Australian embassies in Bangkok and 
Jakarta between late last month and early this month. 
  In the meetings, it is said that North Korea called for 
normalization of diplomatic ties and that Australia, as a 
condition for normalizing diplomatic ties, demanded that North 
Korea accept nuclear inspections by an international 
organization and that it promote discussions with the United 
States and the ROK. Australia says it informed Japan, the 
United States and the ROK about details of the meetings. 
  In the past, Australia and North Korea promoted partial 
diplomatic exchanges in Beijing and other places.

  [Text] At a news conference on 21 January at the Diet 
building, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] leader Tsutomu Hata 
(who is foreign minister and concurrently deputy prime 
minister), commented on the possibility of taking the political 
reform bills to a joint conference of the two houses for 
discussion. He said: "Privately, I can accept any (compromise). 
The most important thing is to change the election system." In 
this way, he explained his view that the ruling coalition 
parties should try to have the political reform bills approved 
even at the risk of having to accept all the demands of the 
Liberal Democratic Party for revision of the bills. 
  Moreover, regarding how the government should deal with the 
situation if the bills are scrapped, Hata said: "We should not 
create a (political) void because we have a pile of work to do. 
However, since the political reform bills are worth making an 
appeal to the confidence of the whole nation, I will not rule 
out any possibilities." In this way, he referred to the 
possibility of dissolving the lower house and holding a general 
election.

Affairs Kanju Sato held a joint news conference at the Ministry

  When asked if they were ready to resign as a result of the 
upper house's disapproval of the political reform bills, State 
Minister Yamahana denied his immediate resignation, stating: "I 
think I should carefully consider if it is appropriate to resign 
right now. I have to consult with the ruling parties about this. 
In fact, I am not allowed to determine my course of action at 
my own discretion." 
  Minister of Home Affairs Sato said: "I have the primary 
responsibility for the enactment of the reform bills. I should 
fulfill my duties by trying my best as a cabinet member at least 
until 29 January (when the extraordinary Diet session closes)."

Edition] 
  [Text] On 21 January the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
submitted to House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi two 
no-confidence motions against Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime 
minister and concurrently foreign minister, and Eijiro Hata, 
agriculture minister, in connection with their handling of the 
opening of the rice market under the new multilateral trade 
negotiations (Uruguay Round). The lower house Committee on 
Rules and Administration will discuss how to deal with the 
LDP-submitted motions at a board of directors meeting on 24 
January. 
  As reasons for the no-confidence motions against them, the

<F P=106> [Discussion between Hiroshi Kato, dean of General Policy </F>
Science Department, Keio University and chairman of the 
government Tax Commission, and Masaru Yoshitomi, deputy director 
of the Long-Term Credit Bank General Research Institute: "On 
the Problems and Future of the Japanese Economy"; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Kato] For the reduction of the income tax to bear 
full fruit, it is important to implement it at the right time, 
when all conditions for it are completed. 
  I think that such conditions have been considerably 
completed 
already. We had better implement an income tax cut starting 1 
January 1994 ahead of schedule and consider raising the 
consumption tax rate during the period when they coincide. 
  [Yoshitomi] It is said that, "in a democratic society there 
are people who call for tax reductions in time of recession, but 
there are none who call for tax increases in time of 
prosperity." However, if the combination of the present tax cut 
and the future tax hike, which can overcome the problem 
mentioned above, is consolidated, we should implement an income 
tax cut as a means of economic recovery and we can fully expect 
its fruit. 
<H3>  Implementation of an Income Tax Cut and a Consumption Tax 
Hike </H3>
  [Kato] A recent sharp drop in personal consumption has a lot 
to do with the negative assets effect -- a decrease in family 
assets due to the bubble economy's collapse. Worried about a 
decrease in their assets, people have hurriedly decreased their 
consumption and have increased their savings. I think that a 
higher savings rate among the aged in particular might have been 
caused by such a phenomenon. 
  The fruits of the income tax cut cannot be expected and the 
income tax cut cannot become an economic stimulus measure unless 
we can stop the negative assets effect. 
  Recently, however, the negative assets effect has finally 
disappeared and conditions which can produce a positive assets 
effect have been created. If land prices decrease another 15 
percent in the case of residential areas and another 25 percent 
in the case of commercial areas, the rate of variation of land 
prices and the rate of increase of nominal gross national 
product will approximately match, where the land prices become 
stable in general. If that happens, a positive assets effect 
will come about, which in turn will further ensure the income 
tax cut's fruit. 
  [Yoshitomi] What is important in discussing the income tax 
cut is to determine the extent of expansion of consumption in 
proportion to the scale of the tax cut. In theory, it is 
possible for the consumers to save all the taxes reduced in 
anticipation of a future tax hike. Will 3 trillion yen or none 
be consumed out of the 5-trillion-yen tax cut? Only the actual 
proof can answer such a question. One actual proof study shows 
that nearly 3 trillion yen will be consumed. 
  [Kato] In any case, I do not think that the income tax cut 
alone will be enough to stimulate consumption. Unless we 
provide an opportunity to consume the income increased through 
the tax cut, motivation to spend will not come about. 
  For that purpose, we should decide in advance that the 
consumption tax will be raised after one year or 15 months. If 
we do that, we can expect the last-minute expansion of 
consumption during that period. There are people who say that 
since this is only a last-minute demand, consumption will 
decline after a temporary increase in demand. However, if the 
economic environment improves even through such a temporary 
expansion of consumption, that will trigger a continuous 
expansion, and there is a very fair possibility that the economy 
as a whole will pick up. 
  [Yoshitomi] I agree with your opinion that the fruits of the 
last-minute demand can be expected. Therefore, what is 
important is how to realize a combination of the present tax cut 
and the future tax hike. 
  [Kato] However, the government and ruling coalition 
parties intend to issue deficit-covering bonds to finance an 
income tax cut. It is not that I have an antipathy to 
deficit-covering bonds. If it is certain that we can reduce 
deficit-covering bonds in the future, I am not against them. 
  Actually, however, it is impossible to extinguish 
deficit-covering bonds once they are issued, which has already 
been proven by history. In Japan, former Prime Minister 
Masayoshi Ohira promised to extinguish deficit-covering bonds, 
but to no avail. The Ad Hoc Commission on Administrative Reform 
chaired by Mr. Doi decided to extinguish deficit-covering bonds, 
but it took the Commission as long as 10 years to do so, 
including an additional period necessitated by the collapse of 
the bubble economy. 
  [Yoshitomi] Since 1973, which was called the first year of 
welfare, the welfare budgets have been expanded; the prolonged 
recession after the oil shock, as well as the tax reductions, 
had increased budget deficits; furthermore, the theory that 
Japan and West Germany should be the locomotives of the world -- 
the locomotive theory -- was developed in 1977-78. Because of 
the various demands from both within and without the country, 
Japan's budget deficits showed a rapid increase in the 
seventies. For this reason, Japan had to dedicate the eighties 
to financial reconstruction. 
  [Kato] Government finances, once expanded under a recession, 
can never be reduced, even when business prosperity returns. In 
economics there is Peacock's "the rule of transfer" [as 
published] but, the government finances once expanded in time of 
emergency do not return to normal even after the end of the 
emergency. This is a common occurrence. 
  [Yoshitomi] Since we have promoted our financial 
reconstruction to such a level with much effort, we should exert 
our ingenuity in implementing short-term economic stimulus 
measures without committing the same error committed during the 
seventies and eighties. 
  [Kato] Issuing deficit-covering bonds will bring serious 
consequences. I was against the income tax cut financed by 
deficit-covering bonds which we cannot be sure of redeeming. 
However, if the present tax cut is combined with the future tax 
hike, I do not mind the issuance of short-term deficit-covering 
bonds as a revenue source. 
  What is important in that case is not a revenue source but 
seeing the present tax cut and the future tax hike always in the 
same perspective. 
  I think that as a temporary measure there should be a 
one-year to about a one-and-a-half-year grace period between the 
initiation of the tax cut and the increases of the consumption 
tax. However, if the resultant economic recovery is not 
satisfactory, the initiation of the tax hike should be 
postponed, with a future tax hike in mind. 
  [Yoshitomi] I think that the grace period of one and a half 
to two years is enough time before the consumption tax rate is 
raised; I think that a certain degree of economic recovery is 
expected in the first or latter half of 1994. 
  It was said around the spring of 1993 that there would be a 
slow economic recovery in the latter half of 1993 due to the 
adjustment of capital stock. Things turned out quite contrary 
to our expectations. There are three reasons for that: 30 
percent appreciation of the effective exchange rate of the yen; 
the cooler summer; and the delay of the execution of public 
investment due to the general contractor scandals. For these 
reasons, economic recovery was delayed for about a year. 
  However, if an income tax cut is feasible starting in 
January 
1994, its effects will be produced in the latter half of 1994. 
If the prospect of the deferred adjustment of capital stock 
becomes certain, an economic recovery will begin in the latter 
half of 1994, although it was one year behind schedule. 
Therefore, the necessary conditions for a tax hike will be 
ready by 1996. Of course, since an income tax cut alone is not 
sufficient as an economic stimulus measure, it is necessary, for 
example, to discuss the problem of the bad debts held by banks. 
<H3>  The Method of Introducing Public Funds for the Writing Off 
of Bad Assets Held by Financial Institutions </H3>
  [Kato] Concerning the question as to whether or not public 
funds should be used for the writing off of bad assets held by 
financial institutions, the important thing is whether the 
financial institution themselves are really serious about 
writing off their bad assets and are making efforts for that 
purpose. 
  [Yoshitomi] If bad assets are to be written off by the 
introduction of public funds, financial institutions must 
clarify such managerial problems as nondividend-paying and 
deficit settlement of accounts; otherwise, the market does not 
function well. 
  [Kato] Concerning the introduction of public funds for the 
writing off of bad assets, I think it is good to provide a 
chance for that. For example, agriculture and forestry-related 
bad assets amounting to 6 trillion yen is held by housing loan 
companies. I think it is right that the government should pay 
the 6 trillion yen in the form of public funds, based on the 
idea that public funds should be used for public industries. 
However, such an undertaking will cause an objection -- why 
should the government help private financial institutions? 
  [Yoshitomi] As you said, the media calls for the 
implementation of economic stimulus measures, but at the same 
time, it calls a stop to whatever measures are to be taken to 
stimulate a sluggish economy caused by bad assets held by 
financial institutions. 
  [Kato] I am not for the introduction of public funds without 
reservations, but I am sure it is time to think of introducing 
them. 
  [Yoshitomi] Chairman Greenspan of the U.S. Federal Reserve 
Bank commented on the issue of bad assets held by financial 
institutions: "Because of their bad assets, the banks are 
unwilling to extend loans. As a result, economic recovery is 
unsatisfactory, thus delaying the solution of employment 
problems. If that is the case, a drastic reduction of interest 
rates will be conducive to the economy as a whole." 
  In short, a drastic reduction of interest rates will let the 
banks earn interest margins and at the same time make them lower 
loan interest rates -- let the banks earn business net profits 
and make the banks use the profits as depreciation funds. When 
you make the banks lower loan interest rates when they are 
intent on earning interest margins, you have no alternative but 
to drastically lower deposit rates. 
  [Kato] Concerning the money flow, we must change the present 
framework in which postal savings are overwhelmingly 
predominant. As compared with the 18 trillion yen collected by 
private financial institutions in 1992, there is 19 trillion yen 
of postal savings, less than half of which, about 8.8 trillion 
yen, was used for fiscal investment and loans. The rest went to 
the Bank of Japan for the purchase of government bonds or to 
stock markets for the purpose of so-called price-keeping 
operations. 
  [Yoshitomi] Concerning stock price-keeping operations, I was 
in charge of the comprehensive economic measures concerned with 
those operations. When the average stock price is on the point 
of dropping below the 14,000-yen level, the market runs into a 
kind of system crisis. Therefore, every effort is made by all 
concerned, including securities firms, so that the average stock 
price will not drop further. However, the purpose is to 
strictly prevent the rapid fall of stock prices and to avoid a 
system crisis; therefore, instantaneous countermeasures must be 
taken. 
  However, the countermeasures were taken for more than a year 
thereafter, and stock prices came to be formed artificially. As 
a result, the stock market transaction balance has continued to 
dwindle to the dismay of securities firms, which has caused 
people to entertain the opinion that price-keeping operations 
are for the rescue of financial institutions. 
  [Kato] Seen from such an angle, it is evident that the 
aggrandizement of postal savings distorts the flow of Japan's 
money. Therefore, postal savings, taking up a little more 
reserved position, should play a more supportive role for the 
sake of private financial institutions. 
  [Yoshitomi] Concerning postal savings, the discussion 
inevitably centers on how to implement "the outflow" of postal 
savings, since it is impossible to hold back "the inflow" of 
postal savings. At present, however, it is difficult to discuss 
the outflow of postal savings. 
  For, when private loans by financial institutions do not 
increase because of their holding bad assets, or when small and 
midsize firms, in particular, are unable to obtain loans, other 
countries cannot take direct action against these; but, for the 
purpose of fiscal investment and loans, Japan has governmental 
financial agencies intended to help small and midsize firms; and 
to our amazement, the agencies' loans are still increasing at 
the rate of 7 percent a year. Therefore, even when financial 
institutions find it difficult to extend loans, small and 
midsize firms are relatively free from troubles. 
  Things are going rather well on a short-term basis, and that 
may be the reason long-term reforms are difficult to implement 
at present. 
<H5>  The Economy Is on the Track to Gradual Recovery in 1994 </H5>
  [Kato] Now, concerning the economy in 1994, first of all, I 
think that adverse assets effect will change into positive 
assets effect. In addition, if a deregulation series is 
implemented, local beer will be made in various places and 
medicine will be sold at convenience stores, thus increasing 
business opportunities. 
  [Yoshitomi] Recently, there have been people who say that "a 
depression is coming," but I am absolutely sure that there will 
be no depression. 
  For example, if Japan's unemployment rate rises to 25 
percent 
like the Great Depression in the United States, we may call it a 
depression. At present, Japan's unemployment rate is 2.7 
percent, which may rise to nearly 3.5, but that is anything but 
a depression. In addition, the former Great Depression was a 
worldwide phenomenon and each nation resorted to extreme 
protectionism. At present, however, there exists GATT, and 
trade rules are in good order. Moreover, at that time, there 
were no thriving countries like Asia today. 
  [Kato] If general contractor scandals subside and public 
works begin to be undertaken, then an income tax cut should be 
implemented. The consumption tax should be raised in the 
future; but, for the time being, the present 4.5 percent 
consumption tax on passenger cars, for example, should be 
lowered to 3.0 percent. We can expect the last-minute stimulus 
effects. 
  [Yoshitomi] People say it is terrible to have their overtime 
work shortened and their bonuses reduced. Conversely, the 
reduction of wages keeps Japan's employment as it is. The 
reason Europe's unemployment rate is high is because wages do 
not decrease even in time of recession because of the downward 
rigidity of wages. In addition, enterprises have to bear a 
tremendous amount of nonwage labor costs, such as installments 
for social security systems, besides wages. A wage system with 
such extreme downward rigidity and high nonwage costs have 
raised Europe's unemployment rate. 
  This is not the case in Japan. Such an adjustment mechanism 
of Japan's labor market is highly evaluated all over the world. 
Wages should be determined flexibly at the market. In 
forecasting the economy for 1994, no opinion is more erroneous 
than the one that the higher spring wage settlements go up, the 
weaker the consumption recession becomes. 
  Higher wages will increase unemployment and strengthen the 
consumption recession. In addition, an income tax cut of 5-6 
trillion yen will probably have the power to raise real wages 
nearly 2 percent. Furthermore, the rise of consumption prices 
will become almost zero. 
  [Kato] Concerning land measures, reconsideration of the land 
tax has not been made yet. However, we can make an exception to 
the rule when one uses the proceeds of land sales to buy a 
choice lot, or we can reduce the tax on the profit upon 
alienation. If these are complied with, the economy's bottom 
will further firm down more than ever before. 
  [Yoshitomi] The appreciation of the yen exerts a negative 
influence on the economy for the first year, but afterward it 
works for the raising of real income through a deduction in 
commodity prices. A combination of three excess stock 
adjustments -- the adjustment of capital stock of manufacturing 
industries, of excess stock of office buildings, and of excess 
stock of durable goods for domestic use -- is the fundamental 
reason for the current recession. Of the three adjustments, the 
adjustment of capital stock of manufacturing industries and of 
excess stock of durable goods for domestic use had been expected 
to be almost completed by the latter half of 1993. 
  For this reason, a slow economic recovery was supposed to 
begin around early autumn of 1993, which was delayed for another 
year due to the higher yen, the scandals of general contractors 
and a cool summer. 
  Judging from this, it is certain that there will be an 
economic recovery in the latter half of 1994. The medium- and 
long-term growth rate of Japan's future economy may be weaker by 
about 1 point compared with the growth rate of a little over 4 
percent after the oil shock. However, Japan has the power to 
grow at about 3 percent due to its higher savings rate and its 
greater research and development investment than Europe and the 
United States. 
  [Kato] Both of us have a bright prospect for 1994. However, 
unless political reform bills are agreed upon and budget 
compilation is moved forward, this scenario may come to naught.

<F P=106> [Article by Eiji Hirano, Bank of Japan: "Loans Unlikely To </F>
Increase for Time Being Based on Grim Real Economy--Debate on 
Expansion of Government Affiliate Share"] 
  [Text] The amount of increase in loans from city 
banks, long-term credit banks and trust banks for the first half 
of fiscal 1993 is anticipated to be a minus 1 trillion yen. 
Since the initially projected amount was 5 trillion yen, the 
plummet will be 6 trillion yen. A homogenization of loans also 
has been seen, and a trend slanted toward short-term loans can 
be inferred. While loans by private financial institutions have 
been sluggish, it is a fact that [loans from] government 
affiliated [banks] are increasing. It probably would be proper 
to have debate on this point. Their plans for the second half of 
the year are rather enthusiastic, like the first half. It 
appears to be a kind of united goal. Steady efforts probably 
will be necessary to increase loans. 
<H5>  Lowest Level in History </H5>
  Looking back over the first half of fiscal 1993, the loan 
record for private financial institutions began and ended on a 
very low note. Initially, the 21 city, long-term, and trust 
banks had established a loan increase plan of about 5 trillion 
yen in the first half. In reality, however, it is anticipated 
that there will be about a 1 trillion yen net decrease. It will 
be a plummet of about 6 trillion yen compared to the initial 
plan. Even viewing recent figures, it seems that the growth rate 
for the average monthly balance compared to the same month the 
previous year for the three business sectors of city banks, 
long-term credit banks, and trust banks in September will be no 
more than 0.6 percent to 0.7 percent, the lowest level in 
history. Loans by private financial institutions continue to be 
as sluggish as ever. 
  Therefore, let's consider first the factors why the plans of 
the financial institutions have been greatly off the mark. One 
probably is that the various financial institutions established 
rather over-enthusiastic numerical values for loan programs in 
the first half. The BIS net worth ratio at the end of March this 
year showed a considerable improvement, affected by the high yen 
and rally in stock prices. Consequently, the BIS standard was 
not a factor curbing loans this term. Rather, it seems that an 
awareness that securing profits by expanding loan volume in 
order to find a source of capital for amortizing mounting bad 
assets was strongly at work in the continued sluggishness of 
loans. Consequently, there is the side effect that the plan 
itself was set high in terms of an unified target, so to speak. 
  The actual trend of the economy, however, was worse than 
expected and demand for funds was weaker by far than anticipated 
at the time the plans were established. Looking at corporate 
plant and equipment funds, for example, there was a strong 
feeling of an unclear future due to the advance of the high yen, 
many firms postponed plant and equipment plans or strived to 
reduce them, and the demand for plant and equipment funds 
continued to be a very weak situation. 
  For working capital also, on the other hand, in addition to 
no increase in sales due to the sluggish economy, inventory also 
already has been reduced considerably, and naturally, demand for 
those funds has been poor. Overall, corporate fund demand has 
been weaker than anticipated amidst stagnated corporate activity. 
  Even viewing the personal field, on the other hand, consumer 
loans recently have been in a minus world compared to the 
previous year. Moreover, there also is the side aspect that a 
demand for home loans was expected due to the rally in housing 
starts, but actually, a considerable portion of the fund demand 
was fulfilled by loans from the Housing Loan Corp. Moreover, in 
so far as there were quite a few repayments of home loans 
executed in the past, there inevitably only was a very low 
increase on a balance basis, even though there was a good 
showing to a certain extent on an execution basis. On the 
financial institution side, the actual situation in the first 
half probably was that although the desire to expand lending was 
great, it was not manifested in performance at all. 
<H5>  Medium- To Long-Term Fixed Loan Swaps </H5>
  Even under such an environment, however, there have been 
various efforts and schemes to increase loans somehow. A typical 
example, centering on city banks, are medium- to long-term fixed 
loans incorporating swaps. In a low interest situation like now, 
corporate needs are for medium- to long-term borrowing. Rather 
aggressive moves have been seen in the form of meeting these 
needs. 
  Moreover, it has been observed that many financial 
institutions are proceeding with adjustments in structural 
aspects such as mechanizing screening procedures and 
strengthening financial planning functions. For example, they 
are attempting to strengthen competitiveness by providing for a 
system which can execute lending rather swiftly with regard to 
lending conditions which can clear screening standards by, for 
example, shortening screening procedures or conducting a rather 
close and organic exchange of information between the lending 
division and screening division. 
  Right now, however, the state of interest competition, which 
is both good and bad for lending growth, is by no means 
perceived to have increased loans at all. That is to say, it is 
because there also is the situation that the huge amount of bad 
debts has considerably curbed the flow of profits and as 
financial institutions, they strongly recognize the need to make 
a profit by ensuring a profit margin. The profit margin indeed 
became very thin as the result of intense interest competition 
in the golden age of the bubble, but in so far as volume was 
rapidly expanding at the time, they were able to ensure a 
profit. However, under a situation like that now when large 
volume expansion is not desired, financial institution operation 
will not be effected at all if there is a concentration on 
lending with a thin margin. Actually, after the profit margin of 
private financial institutions took a trend toward expansion 
from fiscal 1991 after the collapse of the bubble until the 
first half of fiscal 1992, a leveling-off situation has 
continued for the most part since the second half of fiscal 
1992, supporting the move toward profit margin normalization. 
  In addition, the deregulation of liquid deposit interest 
rates next year is drawing near and probably will bring another 
increase in costs for financial institutions. Consequently, it 
can be said that it will not be a situation where they can 
rashly make loans to the point of disregarding profitability. 
Moreover, as a real problem, it is believed that there is the 
side aspect of not being in an environment that can evoke a 
demand for funds by having made some drop in interest. 
<H5>  Midsized to Small Firms Have Further Cooled </H5>
  Not a few voices of criticism have been heard, concentrated 
in the media, about the sluggishness of financial institution 
loans that "the attitude on loans is becoming excessively 
cautious because of reflection on the bubble era." Indeed, in 
comparison to past periods of relaxation, whether good or bad, 
the overall loan attitude is cautious. However, even when 
viewing the August "Tankan" [Bank of Japan (BOJ) short-term 
business review], the DI which determines the loan posture of 
financial institutions has been steadily moving in the direction 
of relaxation, and rather, it can be said that it is in the 
direction of gradually becoming positive as a change in the loan 
attitude. 
  Looking at the vital demand for funds, however, not a few 
financial institutions point out that large corporations have 
hit bottom and medium to small firms have become cool at this 
point. A further concern is the fear that fund demands for 
non-expansionary purposes are gradually increasing, centering on 
auto and electrical machinery subcontractor firms who have 
suffered blows from the high yen. Specifically, funds to offset 
substantial deficits, retirement fund allowances for employment 
adjustments, or funds to finance non-expansionary inventory are 
cited. In these cases, the price of real estate that is 
considered collateral by medium to small firms has fallen 
considerably and in so far as mortgage power is declining, the 
situation of difficulty in borrowing certainly exists. 
<H5>  Decrease in Market Share for Regional Banks </H5>
  In so far as the demand for funds, especially when it comes 
to the best customers, is very limited, loan competition by 
taking over business from other banks and scrambling for market 
share seems to be increasing in intensity. Comparing the growth 
rate level throughout the first half by business sector, the 
regional bank and credit association sectors, rather than the 
city bank and long-term credit bank sectors, generally show a 
somewhat high growth rate. If taken as a trend, however, the 
growth rate for city banks, long-term credit banks, and trust 
banks continues to be leveling-off at this time, but that of 
regional banks, second tier regional banks, and credit 
associations continues to go down month by month. This suggests 
that they have sustained a blow in loan competition and it has 
taken on the appearance of regional bank and second tier 
regional bank shares being eaten up, with the city bank portion 
at the center. 
  Speaking of city banks, long-term credit banks, and trust 
banks, their limited actions are becoming rather homogenous. 
That is to say, it can be inferred that city banks, of course, 
and also trust banks and long-term credit banks, have a tendency 
to be slanted toward short-term loans rather than long-term 
loans. The needs of the firms themselves are for medium- to 
long-term, low interest, fixed loans, but considering the 
interest risk based on such super low interest rates, in 
addition to competing with government affiliated financial 
institutions for this portion, naturally there are limits to the 
ability of financial institutions to respond. As a result, 
lending has come to be centered on short-term loans. 
<H5>  Government Affiliates and Life Insurers </H5>
  As long as they are under a situation where the demand for 
funds from firms is very limited, it is not completely off the 
mark to point out that loans from government affiliated 
financial institutions have become a large threat to private 
financial institutions. In this regard, while private financial 
institutions cannot realize a 1 to 2 percent growth rate 
compared to the previous year, government affiliated financial 
institutions across the board have shown a two-digit increase 
compared to the previous year. If there is a supplier with low 
interest, fixed, and super long-term funds right before your 
eyes, naturally, for example, large corporations will run to the 
Japan Development Bank and medium- to small-sized firms to the 
Small Business Finance Corp. and People's Finance Corp. 
Furthermore, as previously stated, loans by the Housing Loan 
Corp. have shown a marked increase in the home loan market. 
Viewed from the private sector which wants to increase loans but 
cannot, it probably is linked to the impression that fields in 
which they themselves inherently should expand are being stolen 
somewhat by the government affiliates. 
  On the other hand, however, a move to make use of government 
affiliated financial institution agency loans, centering on 
medium- to small-sized financial institutions, has been seen. In 
cases where terms to satisfy the customer with the proper loan 
cannot be offered, it makes use of a method to hook up with a 
customer by brokering a government loan with good terms. In this 
case, it can be taken as the government affiliated financial 
institution playing the role of supplementing the functions of 
the private financial institution. Of course, the intention is 
not to deny the important fixed role which government affiliated 
financial institutions perform, but like today, when loans by 
private financial institutions are hardly increasing at all, it 
probably is natural that the current situation where government 
affiliated financial institutions are greatly increasing their 
share will be debated more. 
  Moreover, regarding the aspect of competitors of private 
financial institutions, some point out an offensive by life 
insurance loans in the large corporation sector. Certainly, life 
insurance loans, viewed relatively, are increasing compared to 
banks. It seems that behind that is the situation that they are 
increasing their loans by offering long-term fixed funds with 
better terms than banks. In the case of life insurers, however, 
different from government affiliates, a price mechanism clearly 
is working there since they must be conscious of the cost of 
procuring funds. They cannot continue forever a low interest 
loan offensive ignoring the cost of procuring funds. Actually, 
the offensive by life insurers had become quite a topic of 
conversation up until around summer, but recently it has 
subsided. 
<H5>  Steady, Accumulated Effort </H5>
  Looking once again all together at the trends of the first 
half, the desire to try to expand loan volume is strong on the 
side of financial institutions, but under the current situation 
where bad debts are curbing the flow of profits, they cannot 
assume an easy posture in maintaining profitability and cannot 
venture into trying to increase loans to the point of carrying 
out interest dumping. Moreover, with this economic situation, 
they must be cautious about risks and cannot expand clients 
haphazardly. As a result, they probably are in a deadlock 
situation where loans do not increase. 
  Nevertheless, the loan programs for the second half of this 
fiscal year established by the various financial institutions 
have become rather enthusiastic at the present stage, like the 
initial plans of the first half. The loan environment certainly 
is not good, but they are strongly aware that a profit cannot be 
secured unless they increase volume to a certain extent. It is a 
situation where they have set plans high implying a kind of 
effective target. 
  It is believed that the emergency economic measures some 
time 
ago, especially the lowering of the official interest rate, 
decidedly have had no little effect in bolstering the economy, 
but considering the grim situation in which the Japanese economy 
now has been placed, it is difficult to believe that the economy 
overall will be refloated immediately by this. Lending and the 
real economy inherently should move in parallel. Since a grim 
situation is anticipated for the real economy in the future 
also, it is believed that an environment where it is difficult 
to increase loans will continue for a while. Bearing this in 
mind, it probably will be important for financial institutions 
to tax their ingenuity in dealing with it while making an steady 
accumulation of effort.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Sumio Hirose: "City Banks: Commencing </F>
Fundamental Job of Digging Up Demand for Funds"] 
  [Text] "Loans are really not increasing." "Results 
were not greatly achieved in the first half." Howls about loans 
not increasing are being raised in every city bank. Due to the 
sluggish economy which has been more prolonged than expected, 
all that meets their eyes is the need for non-expansionary 
funds. It is a situation where the little demand for funds has 
been absorbed by government affiliates. In Greek mythology, in 
Hades after his death, Sisyphus, the king of Corinth, had to 
roll up to the top of a mountain a rock that constantly rolled 
down. The rock rolled down no matter how many times he rolled it 
up. Loans today are truly the rock of Sisyphus. 
<H5>  Plans Unfulfilled </H5>
  The various city banks are not presenting absurd loan 
increase goals such as half-year net increase of 1 trillion yen 
as happened in the bubble era. At most, they say "about a 3 
percent increase on a fiscal year basis." (person in charge of 
domestic operations planning) It is about half the level 
compared to the time of the peak of the bubble. 
  In performance, however, even viewing the loan trends 
announced by the Bank of Japan, the figures continued to be 
about 1 percent throughout the first half. Why have they been 
unable to fulfill the plan? The head offices of all the banks 
say in unison, "the greatest factor was that the economic 
forecast scenario at the time of setting the plan was greatly 
out of kilter." 
  In February to March this year, they had the view that "in 
so 
far as the summit in July and House of Councilors election are 
close at hand, the government will embark on a full-scale 
bolstering of the economy. Due to this, the tone of the economy 
will turn to recovery in summer and thereafter, and we will 
enter a complete recovery situation in the second half." (person 
in charge of planning at high-ranking city bank). In reality, 
however, they could not meet those expectations at all. 
<H5>  Corresponding to the Loan Spread </H5>
  Of course, those on the scene did not sit and wait because 
the economy is bad. In the meantime, they offered loan terms 
less than short-term prime if they were to make the most of 
lending spread with market interest as the base. Moreover, if 
they incorporated a yen-yen swap in this, low interest, medium- 
to long-term loans on a 3 percent interest level would be 
possible. With these attractive lending terms as a weapon, a 
life or death sales effort centering on large corporations 
developed. 
  However, large corporations have not changed their policy of 
basically curbing borrowing. Yet it is a fact that "there were 
quite a few successful cases of converting existing short-term 
prime borrowing to long-term fixed borrowing or narrowing the 
target to [acquire] redemption funds for such as warrant bonds 
or convertible debentures." (person in charge of loan planning 
at high-ranking city bank) 
  Loans below prime rate are taboo in so far as "once they are 
executed, it takes several years to return to principal." 
Consequently, banks must concentrate on spread lending other 
than prime loans. In the operations office of one bank, it was 
such that "in the first half, spread lending on a limited basis 
accounted for 70 to 80 percent." 
  However, all the banks have a line up of the same kinds of 
commodities. So, the next thing that happens is interest 
competition by reducing the spread margin. It is said that at 
one time, "excessive competition was seen such that it closely 
resembled the bubble era." (city bank operations department) 
However, a strong rival besides other banks exists in this 
field. It is life insurers who have been troubled by fund 
employment difficulties. 
  Voices of chagrin are heard everywhere that "regardless of 
reduction in the spread margin, the level of a 0.5 percent 
addition to the swap rate is our limit, no matter how much we 
try. Life insurers, however, are offering an addition of 0.1 to 
0.2 percent even with medium- to long-term ones with a 3 to 5 
year period, and they are snatching away loan cases one by one." 
(person in charge of loan planning) This life insurance 
offensive, however, was conspicuous in early spring, but 
recently seems to have disappeared. 
  Rather, those in charge at various banks vehemently say the 
problem is "the government affiliates such as the Export-Import 
Bank of Japan and the Japan Development Bank." It is the term 
period rather than the interest level in which they are unable 
to compete with government loans. That is because "with low 
interest like today, an interest risk extending for a term 
period of 10 years cannot be borne at all by private 
institutions." (same) 
  Of course, that does not mean a situation is occurring where 
government loans are "devouring" even existing loans by private 
financial institutions. However, "the actual situation is that 
while fund demand is very meager today, we are steadily pursuing 
cases of 500 million yen and 1 billion yen and somehow linking 
them to loans. If government affiliates continue to execute 
loans of 1 billion yen or 2 billion yen on the strength of 
advantageous lending terms, it inevitably will be a big threat 
in a limited field." (person in charge of domestic operations 
planning) 
<H5>  Strengthening of Internal Bank Structure </H5>
  On the other hand, what about the medium- to small-sized 
business market? There is a strong feeling that they "would like 
to increase loans aggressively in the medium to small market" 
only to the class of customer that has a high degree of 
dependency on bank borrowing. (person in charge of loan 
planning) However, they "cannot steadily loan to firms with a 
continued deficit." (same) If this economic situation continues, 
naturally "clients to whom they can loan will be very few in 
themselves." 
  On the other hand, it is a deadlock situation in which great 
success cannot be expected in so far as other banks also are 
stampeding to the few firms with favorable performance. Among 
them, stories have been heard that up until last year when other 
banks changed to a negative lending policy in order to reduce 
assets as far as BIS measures were concerned, they contrived to 
contact them and were able to skillfully take over the business, 
but such examples were extremely few. 
  At this point, the demand for funds that is increasing is 
"non-expansionary." (high-ranking bank). They are "funds for 
lump sum retirement allowances due to plant closures or employee 
reduction programs" or "clothing-related inventory has increased 
because of the cold summer and it is borrowing to provide for 
those funds." (person in charge of loan planning) 
  Looking back over this war situation in the first half, 
there 
is a move among the high ranking banks to attempt to correct 
downward the plans for the second half. However, that does not 
mean that they are greatly pessimistic. The move by firms to 
reduce borrowing due to the collapse of liquidity in hand, which 
had continued since last year, has calmed down at this point. In 
so far as surplus funds have become meager on the corporate side 
also, borrowing for the portion to pay off commitments should be 
a necessity. The view is strong that "in the future, the loan 
balance probably will not turn to a net decrease." (person in 
charge of domestic operations planning) 
  However, it is viewed that "the results from economic 
measures and the drop in the official rate will appear in the 
spring of next year or thereafter at the earliest." 
(high-ranking Kansai-related city bank) The fact has not changed 
that demand for expansionary funds cannot be expected in the 
second half. 
  Therefore, the various banks are prepared to deal with the 
second half, strengthening loan business capability by applying 
their hand to internal bank structure. 
  Specifically, it will be in the fashion of "raising the 
weight of loans in the performance rating, or increasing public 
relations personnel." (high-ranking bank) "While the economy is 
sluggish, expansion of markets for sales growth, or needs for 
various kinds of business information will rather increase. 
Therefore, if we fully demonstrate the bank information function 
and meet these customers' needs, we should be able to link it to 
new acquisitions." (person in charge of loan plans) 
  The only way to do that is "return to the foundation of 
lending operations, grasp the commodities which firms are 
handling and their vendors, and steadily grasp demands for 
funds." (same) Every bank firmly feels the need to look back 
once more on the foundation of lending operations that was 
forgotten in the bubble.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Haruo Tanikawa: "Diligently Maintaining </F>
Balance by Effectively Peeling Off Deferred Loans"] 
  [Text] Although life insurance loans for the first 
half were favorable at the start, growth has been slowing since 
June because of interest rate sensitive clients. For life 
insurers, who cite an increase in loans for stable earnings 
assets as their priority policy, it seems a discouraging start. 
At one time, there had been criticism from the banking world 
about the interest dumping of life insurance loans, but the 
various major companies strongly denied it. Rather, they are 
troubled by the level of long-term interest prime rate that is 
less than the cost of liabilities. 
<H5>  "No Dumping" </H5>
  "The scant demand for funds has been consumed by government 
affiliated financial institutions and life insurers who are 
waging an offensive with low interest as a weapon. There is no 
room left for us to enter." 
  Thus laments a person in charge of loans at a long-term 
credit bank. According to the talk of those involved, the 
various major trading companies borrowed 50 to 100 billion yen 
from life insurers between this April and June. The term is 10 
years, and the rate that was accomplished with callable terms 
(repayment midway is possible when interest drops) was according 
to their rating and sometimes yen-yen swap quotes, but on the 
level of LIBOR flat. It is said that even were some cases with 
minus 20 basis points. The cries rose from banks that "it is 40 
basis points lower than the rate that can be offered by our 
bank." 
  It is true that the various life insurance companies deny 
"suspicions of dumping" by the banking world, saying that "loans 
with interest lower than the long-term prime, which broke the 
record for lowest in the past, strangle our own necks. Even 
though the term of life insurance loans is longer compared to 
long-term credit banks and has the advantage, it is not greatly 
lower than long-term prime." (Meiji Mutual Life Insurance) 
  Indeed, super excellent firms which have a high rating can 
select the interest that is the best bargain from diverse forms 
of interest such as long-term prime fixed, long-term prime 
variable, new long-term prime, LIBOR spread, and bond issue cost 
while looking at the trends of the swap market. Depending on the 
interest situation, it seems that there have been loans at 
interest lower than long-term prime rate (including fixed 
interest returned to LIBOR base) which life insurers "inevitably 
from the viewpoint of general transactions" (leading life 
insurer) consider their standard. 
  It is true that the intense interest competition in loans to 
such super excellent firms is "reciprocal," including city 
banks, trust banks, and long-term credit banks. (A major life 
insurer) Conversely, they complain of the restrictions on life 
insurers, saying that "there is no concept of a spread loan in 
life insurance where the acceptance of liabilities can only be 
limited term buy backs and limited impact loans." (same) 
  Moreover, Sumitomo Mutual Life Insurance considers that 
"firms to which LIBOR apply are basically an AA rating or above 
and the number of companies can be counted on both hands. 
Additions to LIBOR are over 30 basis points as a rule." Both on 
the point of scale and in the aspect of interest, they deny the 
prominence of life insurers. 
<H5>  Start Was Favorable, But... </H5>
  The changes in balance truly indicate that life insurance 
loans are struggling the same as banks. The total amount of 
general lending at the end of July for 27 domestic companies was 
50 trillion yen. It was a 7.2 percent increase over the previous 
year and seemed favorable compared to city banks and long-term 
credit banks, but these figures included deferred loans to banks 
for the second half of fiscal 1992. In the first half of this 
year when the acceptance of new deferred loans ceased, life 
insurance loans also were directly affected by the blow of the 
sluggish economy. 
  The start in the first half (April, May) was favorable. 
Expectations were high for an economic recovery and while 
feelings of future higher quotations for long-term interest 
rates were rising, an increase close to 10 percent for the 
annual rate was realized as the result of "the demand for funds 
by firms which had held off borrowing from January to March 
being manifested centering on April and May." (Nippon Life 
Insurance) 
  "Not much difference is seen in loan clients viewed by 
business sector" (Sumitomo Mutual Life Insurance), but in these 
times, the weight of funds of restructuring has been great in 
fund needs. In other words, they have been equity redemption 
funds and allowances for early repayment funds for borrowing in 
the period of high interest rates. 
  However, when a yellow signal lit up in the economic 
recovery 
at the beginning of June and a feeling of future lower 
quotations for interest rates spread, the corporate demand for 
funds quickly cooled. Rather, repayments exceeded new loans, and 
the balance declined in June and July. It leveled off during 
August, had a slight increase during September, and it seems 
there will be a 1-2 percent increase in the total for the last 
half. 
<H5>  "Would Be Good If It Were a Net Increase" </H5>
  For the past several years, many life insurers have 
clarified 
their position on the importance of loans. The share of loans in 
increased assets exceeded 60 percent prior to 1975. However, the 
share gradually dropped and fell to 10 percent in fiscal 1986 
with the situation of life insurers in the background such as 
the invigoration of aggressive investment in designated money in 
trusts and investment in foreign bonds aimed at profits from a 
rise in stock prices due the external factors of the decline in 
demand for funds accompanying the shift to a period of low 
growth and shift by big corporations to direct procurement of 
financing. 
  Afterward, while corporate demand for capital again became 
brisk in the bubble era, bank loans became subject to the 
introduction of BIS regulations, increases in them were curbed, 
and the loan share of life insurers recovered and in the past 
several years has progressed on the level of 40 percent. 
  For life insurers who must stably employ long-term funds and 
earn a working profit (income gain) exceeding the assumed 
interest rate, it is said that "long term loans are the most 
appropriate as the portfolio." (major life insurer) Especially 
now that the myth of the upward slant of stock prices has 
crumbled and they have learned the bitter experience of 
investments in foreign bonds having suffered large exchange 
losses with the rapid rise of the yen, that idea is even 
stronger. 
  Nippon Life Insurance, for example, in the period of the 
past 
three years has increased the staff of branches in charge of 
medium to small firms and individual loans from 100 to 150 
people. 
  Meiji Mutual Life Insurance developed "a total corporate 
service (TS system)" beginning in 1991. The corporate division, 
which handled only corporate insurance and corporate pensions 
also had a loan function along with the existing finance 
division. In April 1992, persons in charge were also assigned to 
branches in major regional cities, and "success has been 
achieved in cultivating new customers." 
  With the increase in corporate bankruptcies, however, there 
also is a concern that "life insurers who do not touch daily 
fund settlement of accounts will be beaten by banks in 
safeguarding credit." Sumitomo Mutual Life Insurance is 
proceeding with a review of in-house financing regulations for 
thorough credit management of all their client corporate groups 
for this reason. 
<H5>  Laments Amount of Drop in Long-Term Prime Rate </H5>
  For life insurers, who are bound by the assumed interest 
rate 
agreed upon with the insurance contractor, the prolonged low 
interest rate situation "has hit like a body blow." (Medium life 
insurer) Regardless of the fact that the assumed interest rate 
dropped from the 5.5 percent up to then to 4.25 to 4.75 percent 
beginning in fiscal 1993, overall liability costs are in "the 
mid 5-percent level." (major life insurer) Although it was 
settled by finally dropping the lowest guaranteed interest rate 
for pension funds and qualified pensions to 4.5 percent, 
application begins in April 1994 and it will remain at 5.5 
percent until then. Looking only at long-term prime which is the 
base interest for loans, it has become a complete backspread. 
  At the present time, there are no signs that major life 
insurers are relaxing in their position of emphasizing loans and 
at least they are not publicly talking of another drop in the 
assumed interest rate. However, the shadow cast by the prolonged 
sluggish economy is gradually becoming larger.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Norikazu Ozaki: "Interest Rate Response </F>
Dull, No Growth in Long-Term Fixed Rate Loans"] 
  [Text] Generally, corporate borrowing at fixed 
interest rates over long-term should increase at times of low 
interest rates, but the long-term fund needs of corporations are 
as weak as ever. There is the effect of the burst of the bubble, 
but the high yen has made a big, direct attack on the major loan 
clients of long-term credit banks. The will for capital 
investments in the auto, electronics, and machinery [industries] 
has withered. There also is intense competition with life 
insurers and government affiliates on long-term fixed rate 
loans. For the time being, demand for funds has been limited to 
non-expansionary short-term funds such as inventory funds or 
high interest transfer portions. 
<H5>  Miscalculation of Second Half Recovery </H5>
  The long-term prime rate, which is the standard for the loan 
interest rates of long-term credit banks, dropped to the lowest 
level in the past (4.8 percent) in September. It reflected the 
recent weak economic trend and further dropped to 4.5 percent in 
October. However, regardless of this historically low interest, 
it is the consensus view of the three long-term credit banks 
that "unfortunately, it has not been linked to increases in 
loans." 
  Viewed by business sector, long-term credit bank loan growth 
has continued to be minus since last year and the sluggishness 
has continued to be less than that for other business sectors 
such as city banks, regional banks, and trust banks. Generally, 
in a low interest rate situation like the present, long-term 
fixed rate borrowing naturally has been desired by corporations, 
but that is not so. "While stock adjustments are continuing, the 
interest response has been low." (Takashi Watanabe, chief of 
Business Development Section, Business Planning No. 2 
Department, Nippon Credit Bank) 
  It seems that the loan growth for the three long-term credit 
banks was much less than initially anticipated for the first 
half of this year. When all is said and done, the greatest 
factor has been that the actual state of the economy has been by 
far worse than forecasted. Amidst this, the fact that "the rapid 
high yen has withered the corporate investment mind" has had an 
effect. (Hitoshi Nakamura, councillor, Business Planning 
Department, Long Term Credit Bank of Japan) The recent high yen 
has directly attacked the leading industries of Japan such as 
autos, electronics, and machinery. These can be called the most 
important clients of long-term credit banks. Although the high 
yen has not directly made bank earnings a minus, it is not a 
stranger to long-term credit banks which have business financing 
as their principle aim. 
  However, the degree of worry is greater for the second half 
to come rather than the first half which has passed. In the 
annual plan, the first half had been positioned as a so-to-speak 
"time for patience" when the demand for funds would not 
increase. Therefore, the minus level for the growth in loans 
could be tolerated. However, signs of a recovery in the real 
economy were seen for the second half and a scenario of "a time 
to grasp business chances" was painted. However, anxiety has 
deepened where "there even is apprehension that the bottom will 
fall out of economy and the future is completely cloudy." 
  Furthermore, although it can be called loan sluggishness in 
short, the quality has greatly changed. Let's take a bird's eye 
view of the content of loans from last fiscal year to this 
fiscal year. 
  In the first half of fiscal 1992, the burst of the bubble 
was 
actualized, and the demand for funds related to Tokyo 
metropolitan area real estate, which had played a major role in 
new borrowing, stopped. Like city banks, long-term credit banks 
had the goal of improving the contents of assets and exercised 
self discipline on real estate related lending. Upon entering 
the second half, one after the other withdrew from so-called 
financial engineering such as reducing the finance division 
centering on trading companies. This appeared in the form that 
the demand for funds by non-banks stopped in long-term credit 
banks. Then in the first half of fiscal 1993, with the advance 
of the high yen and sluggish economy, plant and equipment 
investment funds for export industries such as auto, 
electronics, and machinery also just about stopped. 
  The net increase amount in loans for the Long-term Credit 
Bank of Japan for the second half of fiscal 1992 dropped to 
one-third of the first half of fiscal 1992, and further fell to 
half of that in the first half of fiscal 1993. If it continues 
this way, there is a fear that the net increase in loans for the 
second half of fiscal 1993 will end up zero. 
  "If the level of 1 dollar equals 105 to 112 yen remains 
fixed, the demand for funds probably will continue bottoming 
until the first half of next fiscal year," say the three banks 
in unison. 
<H5>  Shift to Short-Term Borrowing </H5>
  The increase in loans for all three banks has become a minus 
of about 1 percent over the previous year, but that does not 
mean that there have been no new loans up to now. Viewing the 
breakdown of first half loans by long-term credit banks, "the 
greatest minus factors are the cancellation of hedging loans by 
trading companies and the withdrawal of funds from non-banks. As 
opposed to this, it was equity bond redemption funds centering 
on large firms and plant and equipment funds for some medium and 
medium to small firms centering on the manufacturing industry 
that increased as the demand for new borrowing." (Tsutomu Abe, 
deputy chief, Business Department, Industrial Bank of Japan) 
  However, it seems that the expectations are weak that this 
portion which increased as new demand in the first half will be 
firm in the second half and thereafter. That is to say, 
redemption of equity bonds will peak this year and will decrease 
as a whole next year and thereafter. It seems that there also 
are many "who have shifted to procurement by straight bonds." 
(Watanabe) Moreover, borrowing by medium and medium to small 
firms, which had been comparatively firm up until now, 
inevitably will have a minus increase in the second half," like 
large firms. (Nakamura) At the present time, the balance itself 
in the case of long-term credit banks has not greatly dropped 
immediately because there is a demand for conversion of the 
contract repayment portion. However, there are no prospects for 
enough new loans to cover the withdrawal portion other than 
contract repayment created in the process of changing the 
composition of asset portfolios and it appears that "it 
inevitably will be a difficult situation for one to two years." 
(same) 
  The current demand for funds seems to have become limited to 
non-expansionary short-term funds, which do not make [the banks] 
very happy, such as inventory funds and transfers for high 
interest portions. 
  The fact that long-term loans are not increasing is greatly 
related to the view on interest rates and corporate profits. At 
the present time, the city bank short-term prime rate has become 
3.25 percent and the margin with the long-term prime rate is 
over 1 percent. In the borrowing of funds which they inherently 
wanted to be long-term and fixed, there seems to be a tendency 
in firms which have fund procurement capability to alleviate the 
recent interest rate burden by immediately rolling over with 
short-term borrowing. 
<H5>  Securing Rather Than Increasing </H5>
  What should they do if loans do not increase? Naturally, the 
future environment will not be an extension of the past. First 
of all, above all, "it is necessary to deepen the relationship 
further with business companies." (Abe) In other words, it will 
be necessary to cooperate and demonstrate their special 
character as long-term credit banks by indicating a new vision 
on changes of the industrial structure which is in upheaval. 
  Amidst this, the loan goals for the second half will not be 
established that high. "It is presumed that growth will be about 
the same as the growth of the nominal GNP." (Industrial Bank of 
Japan) So, it tells the painful feeling that "it is not a time 
to take chances. Conversely, we must have a constitution to 
produce earnings even with this much of an increase." 
  Long-term credit banks are procuring funds by bonds, 
especially 5-year interest bearing bank debentures. For this 
reason, the ALM must be viewed in a longer range than city 
banks. At the present time, the high coupon wide of the fall of 
1990 still remains and while loans do not increase, this will 
become a big factor in holding down earnings. It seems that they 
will be forced to take difficult risk control in the next one to 
two years.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Yogo Ito: "Assertion That Financing of </F>
Plant and Equipment Funds on Same Level as Private Institutions"] 
  [Text] Looking askance at the loan slump of private 
financial institutions, government affiliated financial 
institutions are increasing their loan balance with low interest 
financing as a weapon. In so far as it is a time when there has 
been a lot of debate surrounding division of public and private 
roles such as administrative reform, it is a situation where the 
view is gaining prominence that government affiliated financial 
institutions are suppressing private enterprise. However, the 
government affiliate side has not changed its consistent 
perception on functions that supplement private enterprise. 
However, due to the expansion of loan limits that was 
incorporated in the emergency economic measures, the market 
feeling is that a crowding out of fund demand has been generated 
for commercial banks. 
<H3>  Plant and Equipment Funds Also Favorable for Private 
Institutions </H3>
  "We can't help being resentful about the fact that such a 
one-sided view is rampant." A person in charge of business at a 
government affiliated financial institution thus refutes the 
point of the clamorous opinion that public enterprise has been 
suppressing private enterprise in the aspect of loans. 
  Viewing the loan balance by business sector for the period 
from June last year to June this year, according to the 
"Economic Statistics Monthly Report" of the Bank of Japan, the 
growth rate for plant and equipment funds was 5.8 percent of 
city banks, 6.2 percent for long-term credit banks, and 5.6 
percent for nationwide bank accounts. On the other hand, the 
growth rate of non-facility funds was sluggish with a minus 2.0 
percent for city banks, minus 0.5 percent for long-term credit 
banks, and minus 0.9 percent for nationwide bank accounts. 
Totalling plant and equipment funds and non-facility funds, the 
growth rate was 0.6 percent for city banks, 1.5 percent for 
long-term credit banks, and 1.2 percent for nationwide bank 
accounts. 
  In other words, the refutation in the opening paragraph 
views 
as an issue the point that it does not clearly distinguish plant 
and equipment funds and non-facility funds and only argues with 
figures on a total basis where private financial institutions 
are sluggish. On this point, the Japan Development Bank 
summarizes the recent loan trends by saying, "if you consider it 
from the point that the corporate desire for plant and equipment 
investment is sluggish with the seriousness of the recession and 
the circumstances that large corporations are actively procuring 
funds by straight bonds, it is no exaggeration to say that loans 
of plant and equipment funds by private financial institutions 
are steadily increasing and are favorable." 
  The Japan Development Bank is completely specialized in 
long-term loans of plant and equipment funds such as for big 
projects or improvement of infrastructure, and does not make 
short-term loans of working funds. The average lending period is 
about 15 years. Consequently, it stresses that special factors 
are at work, saying that "as opposed to repayments increasing 
within a short period of time and increases in the loan balance 
being small when the lending period is short like with the 
private institutions, the aggregate balance is increasing for 
the Japan Development Bank due to the long-term lending period." 
  Moreover, it emphasizes the point of developing functions 
that supplement the private institutions in terms of quality, 
saying that "by our bank financing projects whose profitability 
cannot be measured precisely by private financial institutions, 
the credibility of said projects rise also. If that happens, it 
also is possible for the private institutions to participate in 
syndicate groups. We are linked, so to speak, in producing 
external results on the private institution side also." 
<H5>  Zenith Age of Functions Supplementing Private Institutions </H5>
  Regarding the cause for the sluggish loans of private 
financial institutions, the analysis at the Japan Development 
Bank is that "it is because compared to plant and equipment 
funds, corporate needs for borrowing working funds are extremely 
sluggish." Because they do not handle working funds, the Japan 
Development Bank concludes that "basically, we are not batting 
with the private institutions." 
  So, what about the Small Business Finance Corp. and the 
People's Finance Corp. which have a relatively high loan ratio 
of working funds for medium to small enterprises? 
  The loan balance situation for the Small Business Finance 
Corp. was an increase of 7.5 percent over the previous year at 
the end of fiscal 1992. Viewing several recent years, it was 
similarly an increase of 8.8 percent for the end of fiscal 1988, 
an increase of 19.7 percent at the end of fiscal 1989, and 
increase of 11.0 percent at the end of fiscal 1990, and an 
increase of 6.7 percent at the end of fiscal 1991. 
  Generally, in recessionary periods, the lending limit of 
government affiliated medium- to small-sized business financial 
institutions is increased by establishment of economic measures 
to facilitated fund procurement by medium to small business. For 
this reason, the loan balance easily has a high growth rate in 
recessionary periods. However, the growth rate of the loan 
balance actually was higher in the bubble era. 
  Moreover, the number of agency loans through private 
financial institutions which have become "a kind of 
characteristic in the aspect of supplementary functions to the 
private institutions," (Small Business Finance Corp) was 2,729 
in July, exceeding the 2,266 direct loans. In fiscal 1993 up 
until July, there were 10,767 direct loans and 13,579 agency 
loans. It is obvious that "viewing the numbers, the growth rate 
of agency loans has been higher than direct loans." (same) 
  The Small Business Finance Corp. is self-confident saying 
that "if we inherently were batting fiercely with the private 
institutions, including working fund loans, agency loans would 
not increase. However, since agency loans actually are 
surpassing direct loans, can it not be said that right now is 
the period when supplementary functions are operating most 
skillfully?" 
  On the other hand, the People's Finance Corp. has less than 
100 employees (commerce and service less than 50) and targets 
petty businesses with capital less than 10 million yen. In so 
far as this field is "difficult for private financial 
institutions to handle aggressively considering the risk," 
(People's Finance Corp.) the Finance Corp. recognizes that 
"intense competition with the private institutions is 
impossible." Actually, the criticism from private financial 
institutions about the People's Finance Corp. is not as strong 
as that for the Japan Development Bank or the Small Business 
Finance Corp. 
<H5>  New Kindling </H5>
  However, it is an undeniable fact that "historically in low 
interest rate situations, the need for long-term, fixed rate 
funds on the corporate side increases." (Small Business Finance 
Corp.) On 21 September, the official rate dropped to an 
historical low of 1.75 percent, but "it has been fully 
considered that loan applications to government affiliated 
financial institutions will rapidly increase in terms of a 
refuge if the feeling of an end to the lowering of the official 
rate has appeared with this." (long-term credit bank) 
  In addition, emergency economic measures have been 
established and while some of the loan limits for government 
affiliates have been further expanded, it can be said that the 
possibility is great for the government affiliate share to 
expand in a situation where the corporate desire for plant and 
equipment investment recovers. 
  Furthermore, there also are cases where the expansion and 
diversification of system financing has become new kindling. For 
example, in order to expand "import system provision financing" 
and "financing to promote investment in Japan," which have the 
expansion of imports and promotion of foreign capital corporate 
investment in Japan as objectives, the Ministry of International 
Trade and Industry incorporated a loan amount of 65 billion yen 
in its rough estimate request. These financing systems have been 
implemented by the Japan Development Bank and the 
Hokkaido-Tohoku Development Corporation under this, but with 
regard to the import system provision financing, special 
interest rates less than the long-term prime rate of 4.3 percent 
have been applied. 
  With regard to project financing and infrastructure 
improvement related financing, since adequate accommodation 
cannot be made just by private financial institutions in the 
aspects of risk and profitability, the significance of the 
existence of the Japan Development Bank there is fully perceived 
by the private side also. However, if it is financing with 
foreign capital corporations as the objective, "it is a field 
that can be fully accommodated by private financial 
institutions." (long-term credit bank) The concern that "the 
private institutions are being crowded out in demand for funds" 
bears a touch of reality. 
  However, the Japan Development Bank considers the same 
system 
to be "based on national policy and we would like to deal with 
it aggressively." They have no comment about crowding out. 
  A person in charge of business at a government affiliated 
financial institution who criticizes the view that public 
enterprise suppressing private enterprise on loans, shut the 
door on it so to speak, saying "with regard to government 
affiliated loans, it is a problem clearly of a different 
dimension than the postal savings problem in the aspect of fund 
procurement." 
  However, regarding fields which have inherently been 
accommodated by private institutions, government affiliated 
financial institutions have been aggressive in lending based on 
expansion of the lending limit and system financing and as a 
result, money transferred from the general account (subsidies) 
are increasing and concern that it will invite an addition to 
the public burden in the future probably cannot be denied. The 
basis for a review and debate of public enterprise functions 
lies here.

<F P=106> [Article by Haruo Kurahashi: "`Savior' of the Heisei </F>
Recession; Looking Into Real Estate Resolution Corporation"] 
  [Excerpts] The Japanese economy was "advised" by the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) "to deal quickly with banks' 
bad assets." The effects incurred from the bubble economy's 
collapse are great, and--still gasping amidst the Heisei 
recession--one can see no sign of recovery. Some even say the 
problems of the financial system are hurting business 
conditions; and the Real Estate Resolution Corporation [RERC], 
created as a "savior" for business recovery, started operations 
on 1 February 1993 with a full awareness of its heavy mission. 
Yet, limitations apparently exist for that corporation, too. 
<H5>  Established Subject to "Restrictions" </H5>
  The collapse of the bubble economy brought on a drastic 
lowering of stock and real estate prices. That caused reductions 
in financial organizations' internal capital accumulations and 
increases in their bad assets, and drove the financial 
institutions into situations more severe than any seen since the 
start of the postwar high-growth period. Since financial 
institutions having a "duty" to aid businesses that have fallen 
into recession have themselves suffered managerial stagnation, a 
situation is even now continuing in which the bottoming out of 
the Heisei recession cannot be confirmed. 
<H5>  Start Was Favorable, But... </H5>
  Let us look at a summary of the RERC, which started on 1 
February to take requests effective for March. 
  The president is former Mitsubishi Bank managing director 
Goto, while the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank's previous chief of the 
operations promotion first division, Akira Miyagawa, was 
appointed executive director and former Bank of Japan inspection 
division chief Masa Ando was appointed fulltime auditor. The 
fulltime officers number three, but besides them there are seven 
non-fulltime directors and one auditor. The organization 
includes 23 persons in the lineup below the division chief 
level. The entire staff below the directors is made up of 
persons on loan from a variety of businesses such as banks and 
life insurance firms. 
  The operations of the RERC begin with financial organs 
bringing in their bad liabilities. The financial institutions 
that can bring these in are all financial bodies that have 
equity in the RERC. Also the National Federation of Trust Banks, 
the National Federation of Credit Unions and those under the 
umbrella of the Central Cooperative Bank for Agriculture and 
Forestry. For banks not under its purview to bring in bad 
liabilities, that "will be considered premised on the buying up 
of such bad liabilities not running counter to the RERC's 
founding precepts nor to the interests of the RERC and all its 
stockholders." 
  As for the liabilities that special housing loan 
institutions 
and non-banks hold, it will be possible to bring these in 
through the equity-holding financial institutions on the premise 
that "a reasonable reconstruction assistance program" exists. As 
for bringing them in directly, that is to be treated in the same 
manner as with financial institutions mentioned before that are 
not under the corporation's purview. 
  Liabilities that are the object of buy-ups are bad 
liabilities secured by real estate, those setting up (basic) 
mortgages as security for the stated liabilities, and so forth. 
The current minimum buy-up unit is 10 million yen for each 
individual liability (original value of said liability at time 
of buy-up), with no upper limit being set. 
  The types of such liabilities are not limited by the 
purposes 
of the funds; but housing loan liabilities for residences are 
excluded. In principle, limits are not set on the term, interest 
or payback conditions. Such liabilities as have conditions under 
which they cannot be dealt with by disputation (such as 
liabilities secured by real estate under dispute in court or 
liabilities subject to application for bankruptcy, arbitration 
or corporate restructuring) are excluded in principle. As for 
liabilities secured by real estate that is under declaration for 
auctioning or under attachment or provisional attachment, they 
will be included if the RERC can confirm that it will not be 
drawn into any dispute. 
  Because trading of bad liabilities has not been done in 
Japan's financial markets heretofore, neither fixed evaluative 
methods nor markets exist for them. Due to that, once they have 
been sold between the RERC and the financial institution 
bringing in the bad liabilities at prices based on reasonable 
estimates, the selling price is fixed based on the amount 
ultimately recovered. 
  At the time bad liability is sold, the financial institution 
calculates the sale loss for the difference in the sale amount 
from the cost of the liability and its estimated value. However, 
at the time the price is set, the institution will recalculate 
the profit or loss for the portion returned to the RERC that 
exceeds a "proper range" within any difference from the initial 
selling price. 
  The most important finding on the buy-up price is the setup 
adopted for a dual check: an appraisal and evaluation of the 
mortgaged real estate by a real-estate inspector in order to 
assure objectivity and fairness (a normal price aiming at a sale 
with a real estate appraisal and evaluation), as well as 
appraisal and evaluation of the bought-up liability by a 
price-adjudicating committee (the rated value of the liability, 
with the evaluation of the mortgaged real estate as a base, 
adding in the element of the liability's estimated recoverable 
value based on the situation of the debtor and the guarantor, 
while excluding the costs involved in recovery). 
  Selection of the real-estate appraisal firm and real-estate 
appraiser is handled impartially on the basis of the RERC's 
selection standards. Also, the price-adjudicating committee is 
made up of members with high discernment and specialized 
knowledge of law, accounting, tax administration and real-estate 
appraisal and evaluation. 
  Incidentally, the members are Gen Takahashi (former 
permanent 
vice minister for finance and former chairman of the fair trade 
commission), Tsuneo Shirai (vice president of the tax 
accountants federation), Hiroshi Kawakita (former president of 
the Japan public accountants association), Ryoichi Inanohe 
(managing director, Japan real-estate appraisal association) and 
Shigeru Yamada (former vice president, Japan lawyers league). 
This committee is independent of the structure of the RERC's 
board of directors and so on. 
  The prices for mortgaged real estate determined in this 
manner are published so as to stimulate and accelerate 
disposition. With the prerequisite of agreement by those 
involved, the RERC publishes such items as 1) the location (in 
principle, down to the town or village name); 2) the type 
(distinguishing between residence, commercial business, factory 
and so on); 3) legal cubic measurement ratio (%); 4) type 
(distinguishing between vacant lots, lots with buildings and so 
on); 5) Size (indicating scale of land by levels); 6) 
(indicating land price by 1,000 yen units per square meter, 
making the unit price the "appraised and evaluated price for 
mortgaged real estate" determined as proper by the price 
appraisal committee, which is the RERC's advisory body); and 7) 
the time of pricing (date when the appraisal and evaluation in 6 
was done). 
  From 1 February the RERC was taking the portion of 
applications for March implementation. On 25 February, it held 
the first price-appraisal committee meeting and on 15 April 
published the first mortgaged real estate prices. Because of the 
fiscal year ending [31 March] the first fiscal year results 
cover this March-implementation portion only. As financial 
institutions had held up their settlements, the number of cases 
of bought-up liabilities was 229 (categorized by amount per 
case: 26 at 500 million yen or less, 39 between 500 million and 
one billion yen, 85 between one and three billion yen, 34 
between three and five billion yen and 45 above five billion 
yen)--a total of 681.7 billion yen, with a buy-up price of 452.1 
billion yen, making it a favorable start-up.

Unit: billion yen 


<H5>  Issue Is Dealing With Special Housing Loan Institutions </H5>
  The results since the start of this fiscal year are as shown 
in the table. When we add the totals for the first half of this 
year to those of the bought-up liabilities for last fiscal year, 
we get about two trillion yen. This shows that deliveries by 
financial institutions are being made smoothly and that 
redemption of bad liabilities is progressing well. However, if 
we look at the results from April through July, a mere 36 
cases--98.6 billion yen in money terms--have been bought up. 
Financial institutions bringing bad liabilities to the RERC are 
to judge the details of their own accounts and promote 
redemptions programmatically according to their earnings. In 
short, after checking out the balance figures to some extent, 
they bring the bad liabilities to the RERC. Thus, deliveries 
would become concentrated after the March settlements and 
September mid-term book closing. Due to that, some people 
criticize that this is shifting bad liabilities as an accounting 
measure; but we have the "major premise" of redeeming bad 
liabilities based on the principle of self responsibility, so 
that in some respects there may be nothing for us to do about 
this. 
  The RERC's organization is as stated above; but under this 
system it reportedly takes some two months to get a decision on 
the buy-up price. We cannot deny that efficiency is low because 
the office focuses on it only for certain set periods. 
  Also, while we say that the processing of 2 trillion yen has 
gone forward, there are those in the finance industry who say, 
"The fact that redemptions cannot proceed on the 7 trillion yen 
in bad assets that are held by the special housing loan 
institutions cannot erase the unease in the financial system." 
  As stated before, under current conditions the special 
housing loan institutions and non-banks cannot sell liabilities 
directly to the RERC. Financial institutions with equity in the 
RERC will have to take them on in part and buy them. Under this 
method an undue burden falls on financial institutions that take 
them in. To resolve this problem, some people ask, "How about if 
the special housing institutions and non-banks buy equity in the 
RERC and then sell the liabilities directly?" Also, we have had 
the suggestion that the securities firms suffering from the bad 
liabilities of the keiretsu non-banks, too, "might as 
well invest in the RERC." 
  Somehow this seems like useless advice. Many special housing 
loan institutions and non-banks are firms whose earnings are 
actually in the red. Considering the functions of the RERC, 
there is no value in those financial institutions not making 
enough profits to be bringing in bad liabilities. In the red 
even if that were free, they cannot take on the further burden 
of the sales losses. That would merely mean further deficits 
being be piled onto them. For example, firms like the Nihon 
Housing Finance Corporation have problems with both their parent 
banks and the farm banks; and there would seem to be no value in 
their bringing in bad liabilities so long as those are not 
resolved. Of course, there would be no problem if the special 
housing loan institutions had the strength to make profits, but 
under current conditions they are not in such a stage. 
  One cannot deny that at the stage when the induction public 
funds became a blank sheet, expectations of the RERC fell. Most 
bad liabilities are held by non-banks in banking systems, 
including the special housing loan institutions and, as already 
stated, there is little sense in their being brought in under 
present conditions. In order to have strong financial 
institutions bring in bad liabilities and for the RERC to buy 
them up, the RERC brings much effectiveness to bear; but under 
current conditions it would be difficult for financial 
institutions with poor earnings to bring them in. In the eight 
months that have elapsed since we started business, 2 trillion 
yen in bad liabilities have collected in the RERC. On the other 
hand, it is hard to say that we are progressing with the 
disposal of mortgaged real estate, given the impact of 
stagnation in the real estate market. 
  In the RERC's founding guidelines it is stated, "It will 
have 
a pump-priming effect in activating real estate dealings," but 
we cannot say it is fulfilling that function under present 
circumstances. Of course, the RERC will not trade in real estate 
contrary to its initial plans. There naturally are limitations; 
but it would be good now to be probing for ways to make it 
easier to dispose of the bad liabilities being brought in. The 
problem is that, while these are piling up, the RERC is making 
strenuous efforts under the restriction imposed on it. As there 
reportedly are over 10 trillion yen in bad liabilities, it seems 
that the time of crisis is yet to come.

<F P=106> [Article by Koei Kaga, journalist: "Taboo of Tumultuous </F>
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation: Secret Strife of Last Don, 
Sasagawa Family"] 
  [Excerpts] The Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation 
that has been spearheaded by Ryoichi Sasagawa and his family is 
the last unexplored region of Japan. Backed by an ample amount 
of funds, it has exercised uncanny influence not only in the 
political, bureaucratic, and financial worlds, but also in the 
underworld, and moreover, we have been in the dark about the 
real situation. However, an internal family feud commenced the 
same time as the Liberal Democratic Party split, and the taboo 
has begun to crumble. 
  It goes without saying that the Japan Shipbuilding Industry 
Foundation was built up in one generation by Ryoichi Sasagawa. 
He is the final survivor of the A-class war criminals. Ryoichi 
Sasagawa is the man who has reigned as "Japan's don," wielding 
great authority in the political world, right wing, and gangster 
world after the war. 
  It has been the post of chairman of the Japan Shipbuilding 
Industry Foundation, the acme of the motorboat racing world, 
which the don has continued to protect. The Motorboat Racing 
Law was enacted by Diet legislation in 1951 when Japan was 
heavily colored by the war defeat. The current Japan 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation was established in 1959. 
  It is the achievement of Ryoichi Sasagawa, who is well 
versed with inside and outside of society, commanded this 
industry that initially was said to be "a place of employment 
for members of ex-special attack unit, Special Service Agency, 
and military police members" and was said to "have tattooed 
gangsters among its racers," modernized it, created a 
nationwide organization, and nurtured the Shipbuilding Industry 
Foundation which was its core until it became called "the 
world's foremost financial group now surpassing Rockefeller." 
  It was also called the Sasagawa empire, and it has become an 
abode of demons not easily penetrated by the outside in which 
his family of "three illegitimate children" and "common-law wife 
who is called the Mrs." are cleverly linked to the vested 
interests of the motorboat racing world backed by his influence. 
  The don will be 94 this year and his former figure of vigor 
has come to an end. 
  "He has stopped jogging, which he had done every day for 
some 
time, and I recently happened to see him after a long while, 
wondering how he was doing. The chairman was standing in a daze 
in front of the house, looking up at the sky. Since it was very 
different from his previous figure, I was shocked" (neighbor of 
Ryoichi Sasagawa). 
  "He repeats the same thing over and over as if he were a 
broken record.... There are times when he feels good and times 
when he feels bad. He no longer carries out a hard schedule like 
before. When he goes to a party, he has private secretaries 
with him and if they notice anything "strange" about him, they 
immediately take the chairman outside" (motorboat racing source). 
  It seems that he is no longer able to hide the 
characteristic symptoms of being old. 
<H5>  Amount Allocated Is 140 Billion Yen </H5>
  When the strength of the don weakened, it was inevitable 
that 
the empire would begin to collapse concerning his successor. 
  Currently, the don's third son Yohei (53) is in the post of 
chief managing director, which ranks next to the post of 
chairman. Criticism about Yohei began spreading at the 
beginning of this year. 
  Then, there has been opposition between Yohei, who has been 
steadily making preparations to inherit, and Shuhei Omori 
(president of Rengo Kaihatsu), and Shigetoshi Kano, chief of 
the Public Relations Office (former private secretary to the 
chairman) who were formerly said to be Sasagawa's closest 
associates. It is reported that an internal feud is occurring, 
and that Shizue Sasagawa (69), his "common-law wife," has begun 
to wield power in place of the weakened chairman. Moreover, a 
scandal has begun to be revealed that Yohei is involved in big 
projects, which he commenced as a symbol of "the start of my 
own second era of founding businesses." 
  Before daybreak on 18 June, a pistol suddenly was fired into 
Yohei's home in Setagaya, Tokyo. Moreover, the pistol thought 
to be used by the culprit and 15 live bullets were placed before 
the entrance as if to attract attention. 
  What in the world is happening in the Japan Shipbuilding 
Industry Foundation? 
  I began to investigate the Japan Shipbuilding Industry 
Foundation at the end of March 1993. Now, dozens of pages of 
inside information lie near at hand. Searching through them, one 
will inevitably notice a surprisingly tricky and complicated 
flow of money that is behind the accounting of the Japan 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, which has been called clean. 
  Below, I would like to close in on the dark side of the 
Sasagawa empire that has not yet been told, based on that inside 
information and interviews with several inside sources. 
  First, I will touch lightly on the motorboat racing world. 
The scale of vested interests held by the Japan Shipbuilding 
Industry Foundation there exceeds by far our imagination. 
  In the house cut system, the amount the motorboat racing 
associations in various regions earn is about 2 trillion yen 
annually with 24 boat raceways nationwide. Seventy-five percent 
of that is returned to fans and the remaining 25 percent is 
allocated to expenses for holding them or the local autonomous 
bodies that sponsor them and the motorboat racing associations 
in the various regions. 
  The take of the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation is 3.3 
percent of sales. In other words, it has become a system where a 
house cut of about 66 billion yen annually rolls in by doing 
nothing. This is allocated as subsidies related to merchant 
shipping and ship construction (Title I grants) and culture and 
welfare groups (Title II grants). However, the actual amount of 
the allocation balloons to about 140 billion yen if the interest 
portion is included. This house cut system takes on a "public" 
nature and should be called tax money that formerly was 
collected by the Treasury, and administration in full view of 
the public is stringently sought. 
  It is Ryoichi Sasagawa who sits in the post of chairman that 
runs the show in subsidy allocation. Moreover, he has a hand in 
the budget as chairman of the National Motorboat Racing 
Association Federation [Zenmoren] that is the agent for the 
racers. 
  According to a racing association source, that system 
"collects the dirty house cut with the right hand and 
distributes it as honest money with the left hand. Moreover, the 
more it distributes, the more gigantic it becomes and stories 
roll in of vested interests from around the world with 
connections to Ryoichi Sasagawa who has an ample network of 
people in it. For example, if a single company is designated for 
a project, a commission is accepted." 
  It is an "ingenious system, completely untainted," so to 
speak. 
  Moreover, the greatest feature of the Japan Shipbuilding 
Industry Foundation is that it is a juridical foundation as 
opposed to other forms of gambling, such as cycle racing and 
horse racing in which, being special corporations, personnel 
authority for officers is held by a supervising government 
agency. In other words, personnel changes are completely at the 
will of Sasagawa and it is "the only publicly operated gambling 
organization" that gets by just with the approval of the 
Ministry of Transport. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Under the law, approval of the Ministry of Transport must be 
obtained for the allocation of those subsidies, but the 
relationship between the chairman and the Ministry of Transport 
is such that "when the chairman goes to give New Year's 
greetings, all the employees stand erect and greet him, and even 
the bureau directors come to the entrance and stand up straight" 
(Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation source). He even has 
the Ministry of Transport under his thumb. 
  Sasagawa designates his own related groups, which are just 
like the tentacles of an octopus, as the recipients to whom the 
subsidies flow. He has cleverly managed to control the matter 
within ahe family by appointing his third son Yohei to 
important positions such as chief managing director of the Japan 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation and concurrently chairman of 
the Tokyo Prefecture Motorboat Racing Association, and placing 
at end points of the industry "Taiyo Printing" (managed by his 
eldest son Masatada), which prints boat tickets, etc.; "Yamato 
Motor," which has a monopoly on racing boat engines; and "Nihon 
Tota," which supplies boat ticket issuing machines (management 
participation in these two companies by second son Takashi, 
currently member of House of Representatives). In the past, 
criticism has been raised many times about this organization 
that "it is improper to have the same family involved in the 
income and outgo of money," and "it should be a special 
corporation like cycle racing and horse racing." However, no 
impropriety has been discovered at all, and consequently, 
Sasagawa control has not been shaken. Everything has been 
accomplished because of the very fact that it is Ryoichi 
Sasagawa. 
<H5>  A Dismissal Incident </H5>
  A rent in that empire began to be seen about one year ago. 
It 
was because a rumor started that "the chairman was senile." 
  It is said that immediately "there was a telephone call" 
from 
Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who spearheads the Seibu group, "wanting to 
meet with Chief Managing Director Yohei" (Japan Shipbuilding 
Industry Foundation source). 
  A rumor spread that Tsutsumi was involving the Ministry of 
Transport and aiming for the position of chairman. A shock was 
generated internally. 
  On 26 May 1993, an internal feud in the Japan Shipbuilding 
Industry Foundation surfaced all at once. 
  On this day, Kano, the head of the Public Relations Office, 
who reportedly opposed Yohei, suddenly was fired. 
  It was disciplinary dismissal action. The reasons were 
recorded thus on a standard sheet of paper transmitting the 
official announcement. 
  "1. Spoke exceeding job authority, intimidated and committed 
intimidating acts, and carried out coercive actions against 
superiors. 
  "2. In addition, took similar actions against fellow workers 
and committed impardonable acts in an organization." 
  "The above-stated points 1 and 2 pertain to No. 2 and No. 5 
of Article 49 of the Work Regulations." 
  Intimidated superiors and fellow workers -- is not a gentle 
reason. However, in essence, it seems the gist is that "he went 
against Yohei who is the chief managing director." "He made use 
of the media and leaked the inside situation to the outside." 
  Kano met Ryoichi Sasagawa when he was 27, became entranced 
by 
the Sasagawa idea, and "hired himself as private secretary." 
Until a certain time, he was the fellow usually at the side of 
the chairman and thereafter came to work for the Japan 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation for a period of 20 years. 
Something extraordinary must have happened for a man like Kono 
to be punished unilaterally and in a form equivalent to "a 
death sentence" for a white-collar worker. 
  The Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation began to shake 
inside with the disciplinary dismissal of Kano. Chief Managing 
Director Yohei's side began a purge of the Kano group. 
  Section chiefs who were believed to be friendly with Kano 
were called one by one and given a hearing on the circumstances. 
  Furthermore, agents who were acquainted with Kano from the 
standpoint of chief of the Public Relations Office were 
pressured. 
  Clearly, something unusual was happening in the Japan 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. 
  What was the real reason that he was fired? I met Kano. 
Along 
with claiming that the punishment was improper, he informed me 
about the real state of affairs and that a reign of terror by 
Chief Managing Director Yohei had begun inside the Japan 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. 
  Below, I will pursue the background for this sudden 
punishment based on testimony from Kano and some 10 odd inside 
sources whom I met. 
<H5>  A Single Word From the "Mrs." </H5>
  The strategic preparation for the recent disciplinary 
dismissal actually goes back to a year ago. 
  Last year, a similar incident occurred inside the Japan 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation concerning a personnel change 
of the chairman's private secretary. 
  In March, Chief Managing Director Yohei broached the subject 
with M, who had been the chief of the chairman's Private 
Secretary Section, that he wanted "to replace him soon." The 
various department heads acknowledged that and left it up to the 
chairman. However, when Managing Director Yohei and Masahiko 
Yoshimatsu, director of the Secretariat, sounded him out, the 
chairman indicated that M would stay in his post and, 
ultimately, it was left at that. 
  However, it was 31 March, the day before delivery of the 
appointments. 
  When M, chief of the Private Secretary Section took the 
chairman to his home in Sengoku, Tokyo, his wife, Shizue 
Sasagawa, came out and said, "You won't need to come starting 
tomorrow." The chairman was silent and said nothing. 
  With these words, the personnel change was made. The 
personnel change was settled overnight in a form that accepted 
the will of the wife, not a discussion of the chief of the 
Secretariat and others with the various department chiefs. The 
next day, M, chief of the Private Secretary Section, was 
transferred to be chief of the Loan Section. 
  His wife Shizue is the person mentioned before who is called 
"Mrs." in the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. 
  She is said to be "the woman closest" to the chairman and is 
the only person who can influence the mind of the weakened 
chairman. Perhaps for that reason, Chief Managing Director 
Yohei, who "had been on bad terms with her for a long time" 
(according to a source), quickly got close to the wife, 
beginning about one year ago. 
  However, although she lives in Sengoku and carries the last 
name of Sasagawa, she is not actually the legal wife of the 
chairman. Ryoichi Sasagawa's legal wife is Kazue (73), who is 
called "the Osaka Mrs." by those inside. Shizue took the last 
name of Sasagawa by becoming the adopted daughter of the 
chairman's younger sister. Of course, she is neither the real 
mother nor the foster mother of Chief Managing Director Yohei. 
  However, she is said to be "the woman that the chairman has 
loved the most since the war," and she was the woman who made 
visits almost daily to meet Ryoichi Sasagawa when he was 
incarcerated in Sugamo Prison as a class-A war criminal and was 
awaiting a death sentence (later released). Sasagawa later told 
those close to him that Kazue became extremely angry at him when 
he told her that he was `thinking of putting Shizue on the 
family register.'" 
  She is talented on the chikuzen biwa (style of lute playing) 
and it was Shizue's biwa at the end of the NHK program that 
ended with "Goodbye, everyone in Japan" on the day of the Iwo 
Jima defeat. She is also a scholar in Chinese poetry recitation 
and currently is vice chairman of the Japan Recitation, Sword, 
Poetry, and Dance Promotion Society [Ginkenshimai], one of the 
related groups of Ryoichi Sasagawa. A person close to the 
Sasagawa family says, "She is a charming person and still like a 
schoolgirl." 
  However, there is another face to her. That is the face of 
"empress of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation." This 
spectacle is often witnessed by the staff in the Japan 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation building: 
  A person connected with the Japan Shipbuilding Industry 
Foundation waits holding a hot towel in front of the women's 
restroom. When wife Shizue comes out, he says, "Here you are, 
Mrs." and holds it out to her respectfully. 
  Moreover, the Benz in which she rides, including the driver, 
comes from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. The 
gorgeous recording room across from the elevator hall on the 
10th floor of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation 
building was made for her, and it is said that "special 
consideration is made" to her group for subsidies that are 
granted by the foundation every year. It is a privilege given to 
"the woman that Sasagawa loves most." 
  Her words that "you won't have to come here starting 
tomorrow" truly rival the words of the chairman. [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  Secret Agreement on Coup d'Etat? </H5>
  On 26 May, the fateful day for Kano came. 
  It was the disciplinary dismissal action. Kano has filed a 
personal integrity suit with that as a complaint. 
  It could be that Chief Managing Director Yohei punished 
Kano, who previously had been close like a brother, as a warning 
for "a fellow who knows too much about me" because he coveted 
the post of chairman. 
  It seems that the results were immediate. A person connected 
with the foundation whom I contacted designated a hotel room as 
the place for collecting the information and was worried about 
being noticed and being followed. 
  "Indeed, such punishment was unusual. However, he had been 
making very threatening moves for the past year. It was 
punishment for that series of moves." 
  Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu explains thus. And after 
acknowledging an apology in front of the department and section 
chiefs on 5 April, he flatly says, "There is no internal feud 
as has been reported. It (the foundation) is extremely calm." On 
the other hand, he said there is an anti-Yohei group inside 
that sympathizes with Kano. 
  Unmistakably, a serious disturbance is occurring in the 
Sasagawa empire that had boasted of being a monolith. 
  Such information has leaked from in and around the 
foundation 
as if it aimed at the cracks. "Actually an emergency motion was 
scheduled to be introduced at the board of directors meeting to 
approve the settlement of accounts on 27 May. It was to move 
Chairman Sasagawa to honorary chairman and install Chief 
Managing Director Yohei in the post of chairman. Then the 
director of the Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau at the 
Ministry of Transport would receive a post-retirement 
appointment [amakudari] to the empty post of chief managing 
director. There had been a meeting for that purpose between 
Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu and Director of the Maritime 
Technology and Safety Bureau Toda and it seems that Director 
Toda had said, `If the post of chief managing director is 
returned to us, Yohei will be appointed chairman somehow or 
other. The Ministry of Transport will take the responsibility 
and make the rounds of Nagata-cho (the politicians).' 
  "However, Takashi, who heard this, said that `It would be a 
serious matter to do such a thing when trouble has been 
reported,' and called it off. Ultimately, the secret agreement 
on the coup d'etat plan could not be materialized." 
  Managing Director Yohei, Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu, 
and Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau Director Toda deny the 
secret agreement, but several persons on the inside say there is 
no mistake. 
  Nevertheless, what are the serious allegations that have 
come 
out from time to time? The big project allegations that Kano 
told to Chief Managing Director Yohei at the Hotel Okura and 
were later reported by some of the media are the allegations 
concerning the "Hotel Kaiyo," the super high-rise hotel that is 
said to have had total construction costs of about 25 billion 
yen, and "Boatopia Himeji," an off-track boat ticket sales 
office that the motorboat racing world launched to compete with 
horse racing. Perhaps Kano might have been fired because he 
touched upon that "alleged secret agreement." 
  Tracing the flow of money, I came up against some rather 
interesting facts. One purpose of this report is to shed light 
on the actual situation of that accounting. 
  Before that, however, I would like to review the details 
concerning the appointment of Yohei to the position of chief 
managing director, which is virtually the No. 1 post. It is 
because he was appointed to this post that the propriety of 
heredity, which should not exist at all in a foundation that is 
a nonprofit corporation, is being questioned. 
  Ironically, it was Kano and Omori who made Yohei the chief 
managing director. At one time they worked together in the 
foundation as a "reform group" which involved Yohei. 
  In May 1989 Yohei was appointed chief managing director of 
the foundation. 
  The post of foundation chief managing director originally 
had 
been a seat designated as an amakudari post for successive 
directors of the Ship Bureau (later, the director of the 
Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau) in the Ministry of 
Transport. 
  It is said that when Ministry of Transport bureaucrats were 
appointed to that seat "the foundation had been virtually taken 
over." The Ministry of Transport had the authority to 
distribute amakudari to important places. "They would wait 
patiently. That was the feeling in the Ministry of Transport, 
and when the chairman died, they would take control at once and 
make it a special corporation like the Japan Keirin Association 
and JRA [Japan Racing Association]." When they tried to hold 
department or section chief conferences, they were rejected 
with the words, " Go talk to the Ministry of Transport and 
discuss that with them," or "There is no need for you to think 
about that," and they could not even hold conferences. 
  "They wanted to grasp the post of managing director and make 
the foundation a private enterprise. They wanted to create a 
free, open-minded work place." 
  That was the reform. Kano and Omori were at the center of 
the 
group promoting it. 
  The two schemed to recapture the chief managing director 
post, which is basically the top post after chairman, from the 
Ministry of Transport, place a private citizen in it, and make 
the foundation a private enterprise. 
<H5>  "There Is No One Left But Me" </H5>
  The chance came suddenly. 
  In 1983, Chief Managing Director Eiichi Tasaka, a Ministry 
of 
Transport veteran who was widely known as an able man, suddenly 
died. It was just about that time that Yohei had joined the 
foundation as a director. Until then, Yohei had been at "Nihon 
Tota," which was connected with Takashi Sasagawa, but "He was 
young, smart, and articulate. This person might some day...." 
  Thinking thus, Kano and Omori brought him along. 
  They probably could sweep out the Ministry of Transport 
completely by this. 
  Quickly, Kano and others persuaded the chairman. Everyone 
was 
fervent. Yohei also was in the middle of it. The one planned for 
the post was Yujiro Shinoda, professor at the Social Economics 
Research Center at Sophia University. He also was a director of 
the foundation and was not totally unrelated. 
  "We will have Shinoda take over the post." 
  The Ministry of Transport was silent in the face of a mere 
word from the chairman. It happened in 1984. At the time, this 
personnel change received much attention by the media, evoking 
talk about "the appointment of a literary scholar to what had 
been an amakudari post for successive directors of the Ship 
Bureau of the Ministry of Transport." 
  However, Shinoda changed the moment he sat in the chair of 
chief managing director. 
  It was a position where the budget of 100 billion yen could 
be moved anywhere by his signature alone. That was magic power. 
The power little by little ate away at Shinoda who had been a 
scholar. The crowd hoping for subsidies set him on a pedestal 
and he became alienated from the staff. 
  Shinoda fell ill. 
  That was the time. Yohei, who had been reticent up until 
then, said to Kano and the others, "I will be it. There is no 
one left but me." So, Yohei was appointed the post of chief 
managing director in 1989." 
  However, the reaction of the Sasagawa family was strange. 
The chairman extremely disliked Yohei's appointment to the 
position of chief managing director. It was Omori and Kano who 
persuaded him. Ryoichi's three children, including Yohei, are 
illegitimate, and Ryoichi Sasagawa did not hesitate to say to 
people around him that "he is no child of mine." When his 
associates said that his face resembled him, Sasagawa would make 
a serious face and say, "No, I went to the hospital and fully 
checked this out (pretending to squeeze his crotch). I have no 
offspring." 
  At times he has shouted at Yohei, "Give back your name (of 
Sasagawa)!" On those occasions, Yohei has turned pale. It can be 
said that Sasagawa is more severe than necessary with Yohei. 
  When Yohei volunteered that he wanted to be chief managing 
director, the Sasagawa family was rigidly opposed. At the time, 
the wife Shizue, with whom he was on bad terms, said with rage, 
"If you do that, the Sasagawa family will be destroyed. It will 
fall to pieces!" Takashi, who already had turned to the 
political world, was furious with anger. "What are you doing!" 
he stormed in with rage, and it is said that a terrible quarrel 
between brothers took place. It was a fight to be heir to the 
don. 
  It will be mentioned in more detail later, but the Sasagawa 
family had to have "a flesh and blood fight" concerning the heir 
to the don. 
  It is said that Yohei begged, "Father, why don't you approve 
me? Let me do it," while crying in front of Ryoichi in Sengoku. 
It was Chief Managing Director Yohei that was born as a result. 
It was a difficult delivery, but the birth of the young chief 
managing director seems to have held the hopes of the reform 
faction staff that "it will change the image of the foundation 
at once by this." [passage omitted] 
  Yohei was born the child of Kiyoko Ogawa (deceased), a 
hostess at Tokyo Kaikan, a high-class cabaret in Ginza, Tokyo, 
in 1939. According to a person close to the Sasagawa family, 
"she was the most beautiful of all the women with whom the 
gallant chairman had relations." However, Ryoichi visited the 
home of Kiyoko in Asakusa, Tokyo, only several times a year. It 
is mentioned in The Unprecedented Man Ryoichi 
Sasagawa (by Sohachi Yamaoka), which is said to be written 
based on dictation from Sasagawa, that Yohei remembered Ryoichi 
coming to the house in Asakusa only three or four times when he 
was about five. [passage omitted] 
  It is reasonable that Yohei grew up as a child without 
knowing the face of his father at all. 
  After Ryoichi left Sugamo Prison, he lived with Shizue. When 
Yohei turned 18, he was placed in the charge of Ryoichi at 
Sengoku, but it was in 1970 when he became 31 that he formally 
took the last name of Sasagawa. Although Ryoichi was his own 
father, he was not a father to him. Such probably was the 
existence for him. Yohei was daunted in front of Ryoichi. 
  On the other hand, Kano and Omori were the closest 
associates of Ryoichi and those outside say, "The two seem to be 
just like children of the chairman." [passage omitted] 
  There is a crowd that is on more intimate terms and closer 
just like sons to Ryoichi Sasagawa than him [Yohei]. It is not 
strange that the buds of love and hatred toward them already had 
been cultivated there. When Yohei grasped authority -- the post 
of chief managing director -- he changed completely and probably 
could not avoid looking at them with a harsh eye. The reason for 
Yohei's later favorite phrase, "I will act differently from the 
chairman," probably lies in his early days. 
<H5>  Chairman Collapses at Party </H5>
  On the chairman's state of health, Secretariat Director 
Yoshimatsu says, "He is in good health. He comes every morning 
and decisions are made every day. He has no illness peculiar to 
the old as written in the media. Being old, however, he 
sometimes repeats the same story from beginning to end. Other 
than that, he has somewhat lost his ability to remember. His 
only chronic disease is hemorrhoids and he was hospitalized only 
for two days for surgery on an ulcer on his shoulder," but.... 
  Ryoichi Sasagawa's health condition has been concealed until 
now by a very few close associates. Only a very few know 
about it even within the foundation. It is because the Ministry 
of Transport, who had the position of chief managing director 
stolen away since Eiichi Tasaka, has been on the alert, looking 
for a chance to recover it. They must not give them an excuse. 
  According to those around him, Sasagawa, when he was 
healthy, 
"would not use the elevator in buildings of some 10 stories, but 
would walk down the emergency stairs. When asked why, the 
chairman would say, `I am chairman of the World Federation of 
Firefighters. I can certify safety; besides, it is good for the 
body.' The people with him got tired. It was hard when they 
reached the bottom of the emergency stairs and found the door 
locked and they all had to go back up the stairs with the 
chairman. They got really tired." 
  "In any event, he is healthy. Even though he is over 70 
years 
old, he shows people that he is healthy by doing push-ups. Even 
if you say `please don't,' he continues, saying `No.' You'll 
be amazed." 
  "At any rate, he has good intuition. He goes through the 
thick documents at tremendous speed, stamping his seal of 
approval, bam, bam, bam, bam. Yet sometimes he comes to a 
sudden stop; he knows when there is something wrong. It's like 
he smells it. It's magic. You'll be amazed." 
  Sasagawa has a tremendous tenacity for life. To prevent 
senility, he runs high voltage electricity through his body to 
make the blood circulation good for peripheral nerves. Moreover, 
he does all sorts of things, such as taking the fresh air and 
taking tonics. 
  This healthy Sasagawa suddenly collapsed around 1981 or 1982 
in Hakone. 
  "He was attending a party and when everyone made a toast, 
the 
chairman collapsed with a thud, still holding his glass. What? I 
thought, but the chairman collapsed so that the contents of the 
glass did not spill. `Chairman, you must not joke,' Eeveryone 
was saying. Then he began snoring and everyone was alarmed and 
confused." 
  A doctor was called immediately. It was a light cerebral 
hemorrhage. Sasagawa was in a state as though he was dead for 
about two months and could not move. When he gradually became 
better, "he pulled out his own hair and saying, `It must not be 
good to have so much hair,' `How could I allow myself to succumb 
to a trifling thing like this hair!' he glared at the hair that 
he clutched. Then when he had a little command of his body, he 
crawled restlessly around the room." 
  Those concerned concealed it with a trip abroad. 
  The second time he collapsed was in 1983 when Sasagawa was 
84 
years old. The site was the Keio Plaza Hotel. He was returning 
from a lecture. In the lecture that day, Sasagawa had talked to 
the audience with exceptional strength. 
  "Just as he got into the car, he tottered. When I looked, he 
was asleep, snoring. He was immediately hospitalized at St. Luke 
Hospital. It took one week for him to recover." 
  That too was completely concealed. 
  After that, Sasagawa was fatigued and collapsed many times. 
  Even though he was urged to rest, he carried out a hard 
schedule, saying, "Even if I hide in a vault and have 100 
doctors manage my health, when it is time to die, I will die." 
  The restoration of Sasagawa's health began when he was 88 
and 
started jogging, but his body gradually has weakened like a 
fire going out. 
  It seems that his close associates, who watched him 
deteriorating, began to think that they would like to make it so 
that they could speak of him with a nicer title, not the title 
of "left wing, A-class war criminal" when he died. The strategy 
to capture the Nobel Peace Prize was born there. 
  One thing is noticed in viewing the profile of Ryoichi 
Sasagawa. 
  The image of "respect motivated by fear" which he has had 
before and after the war has changed dramatically in two 
aspects. One is the conversion from a symbol of anti-Communism, 
and the other is the start of aggressive activities abroad. 
<H5>  Ulcer Was the Occasion for Weakening </H5>
  When the controversial Unification Church established its 
first base in Japan in 1963, it was Ryoichi Sasagawa who became 
its consultant. In the late 1960's, Sasagawa was appointed 
chairman of the International Victory Over Communism Federation, 
but at the time, several staff members of the Shipbuilding 
Industry Foundation and his related groups, by order of 
Sasagawa, "took lectures to become leaders of the Unification 
Church at the training center for motorboat racers at Lake 
Motosu" (inside source). 
  Also it is said that he gave ministers of the Unification 
Church part-time work and supported them by giving them a salary 
for about a year. 
  The sudden conversion from such "anti-Communism" was in 
1972. 
Actually, this was due to advice from his close associates. Then 
in the late 1970's, Sasagawa became aggressively involved in 
activities abroad with their advice. The object there was 
acquiring the Nobel Peace Prize. 
  The beginning of a chance seemed to be when the grandson of 
Nobel came to Japan. It is noted during the various talks there 
that he was convinced that "The Nobel Prize is not given, it is 
acquired. There are people in the world who nominate for the 
Nobel Peace Prize. I must make inroads with them." 
  However, their names are concealed. He obtained the 
information little by little. Then his private secretaries found 
their way to the nominators. 
  For example, there is Linus Pauling. He was a person who 
took 
two, the Nobel Peace Prize and the Nobel Chemistry Prize. He was 
a researcher on vitamin C and he also was one of the nominators. 
So, the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation began subsidies to the 
Linus Pauling Research Institute.... He just privately diverted 
foundation money to satisfy his own desire for fame. 
  This was a secret that Ryoichi Sasagawa was being promoted 
as 
a candidate of the Nobel Peace Prize. [passage omitted] 
  The occasion when Sasagawa gradually began to wane was the 
surgery for the ulcer that Secretariat Director Yoshimatsu 
previously mentioned one year ago. However, an informed source 
says that it was not an ulcer, but a burn scar. He explains, 
"When he was in Sugamo Prison, U.S. officers mistakenly 
suspected that the moxa cautery administered by the B- and 
C-class war criminals to people in China was `torture' and they 
were about to inflict severe punishment. When the chairman heard 
this, he said, `That is medical treatment. It is done this way,' 
and he burned some moxa at the nape of his neck to show them and 
dispelled the misunderstanding. It was the burn that came from 
that time." 
  It is said that when that scar was neglected, it became 
cancerous and was removed by surgery, but the total anesthesia 
of his body was the clincher and Ryoichi weakened all of a 
sudden. [passage omitted] 
  This weakening made Yohei uneasy. 
  Preparing for the worst, he had to begin creating a hasty 
system. 
<H5>  "Favors Sold to Politicians" </H5>
  As previously mentioned, the motorboat racing world is a 
world that could be created because of the very fact of Ryoichi 
Sasagawa. 
  When Yoshio Kodama, who was called the leader of the right 
wing, controlled the seven chivalrous groups of Kanto and 
created the "Kanto Association," visited Sasagawa, he would 
take a rigid, upright position before the room and enter, 
saying, "Kodama is coming in, sir." He never sat on a chair 
until Sasagawa urged him. Moreover, if a fellow came in hopes of 
money, Sasagawa chased him away with a roar, saying "you have to 
kill me to get it!" 
  Yohei does not have that power. He has only the influence of 
his father. 
  So what was he thinking? It was an alliance with the 
political world and the Ministry of Transport to replace that. 
That is what Ryoichi most hated and especially alliance with the 
Ministry of Transport was close to "shaking hands with the 
devil" for a group who was defending to the death the position 
of chief managing director and wanted to promote privatization. 
In the case of Chief Managing Director Yohei, however, it 
probably was absolutely necessary to achieve inheritance of the 
chairman post which he eyed relentlessly. 
  Thus, it was a natural course of events for the hearts of 
close associates who had come to serve Ryoichi and Yohei to be 
alienated from Yohei. 
  It is said that Tsuneo Watanabe, president of YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN, has become the "political world instructor" for Yohei. 
It is said that Yohei quickly became close to both former prime 
ministers Yasuhiro Nakasone and Noboru Takeshita through him. 
  For example, on 5 May 1990, he played golf with both former 
prime ministers Nakasone and Takeshita and Tsuneo Watanabe at 
the Fuji Sakura Country Club in Yamanashi Prefecture. On 14 
June, he played golf with Takeshita, Kiichi Miyazawa, and Tsuneo 
Watanabe at the Three Hundred Club in Shizuoka Prefecture. 
Moreover, on 31 July, he golfed with both former prime ministers 
Nakasone and Takeshita and the deceased Shintaro Abe, and they 
chatted for two hours the night before at Yohei's villa on Lake 
Kawaguchi. 
  The staff says about such things, "When we meet with 
officials, we are instructed to report casually that Yohei met 
with Takeshita yesterday..." 
  Moreover, in September 1990, when he returned to Japan after 
a meeting with former Soviet President Gorbachev, Yohei spread 
the rumor among the staff that "I was carrying secret documents 
for Takeshita." Moreover, now that Takeshita has lost his 
standing, he has begun to say inside, "Takeshita is no good. Now 
it is Mitsuzuka." 
  The problem, however, is not the indiscreet talk or golf. 
The problem is the reason why he is contacting the political 
world. He is using subsidies from the Japan Shipbuilding 
Industry Foundation, which is inherently public money, to try to 
buy favors from politicians. 
  The subsidies allocated by the Japan Shipbuilding Foundation 
are under the rigorous supervision of the Ministry of Transport, 
and such a thing should not be permitted. However, "There are 
many recommendations from Diet members in the Foundation subsidy 
applications, but when Chairman Sasagawa was healthy, he highly 
detested such strings attached. Therefore, a sense of fair play 
was required. Chief Managing Director Yohei, however, is 
different. He gives preferential treatment to them and when the 
subsidy grants are informally decided, he orders staff to 
`quickly contact the politician and sell a favor'" (informed 
internal source). 
  Moreover, each time, he has the staff confirm whether thanks 
have come from the interceding Diet member and if not, he has 
them phone for a reminder. 
  This is just like using the subsidies allocated by the 
foundation as a tool for Yohei's political schemes 
  Actually, I have two pages of inside information at hand. 
One 
is a letter in memo style. The other is a list entitled "Project 
Applications for Fiscal 1988." In other words, it is information 
related to the spoils from Yohei's "selling favors" to 
politicians. 
  Written in the letter is thus, "Yoshimatsu, There was a 
telephone call of thanks from the distinguished gentleman 
previously mentioned. After referencing your list of names, 
please let me know the names of those who have not contacted us. 
Sasagawa." 
  Sasagawa, of course, is Yohei. 
  Written on the left under "Foundation welfare appreciation 
TEL" is a list of the names of 23 House of Representatives 
members, including Koichi Kato, and three House of Councilors 
members. 
  There is another list. On it are the names and telephone 
numbers of 42 Diet members, including Yasuhiro Nakasone, Ryutaro 
Hashimoto, and Yoshiro Mori, and then the name of the group and 
scheduled amount for the grant. 
  Like this, for example: 
  Name of Diet member or other introducer: Shoichi Nakagawa 
(Hokkaido 5) 
  Name of group: Yubetsu Welfare Association 
  Name of project: construction of special home for care of 
senior citizens 
  Ranking: (blank) 
  Amount of subsidy/assistance request: 194,300 
  Amount scheduled: 194,300 
  The unit is 1,000 yen. Then there is a mark believed to be a 
check ahead of the name. Perhaps being no contact of thanks yet, 
"later" is written next to Noboru Takeshita. There is also his 
older brother's name, Diet member Takashi. 
  When I tried to confirm it with Diet member Nakagawa, he 
said, "The item of your inquiry was recommended by my office. 
When building a special home for the care of senior citizens, at 
the request of the Hokkaido Development Agency, we asked the 
Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation and others for a 
construction fund grant for the portion not covered by the 
Ministry of Health and Welfare budget. Since this is a open 
matter, I do not thing that there is any special problem" 
(Private Secretary Saito, Nakagawa's office). 
  Regardless of the fact that the source of the funds is the 
house cut on gambling, the subsidies allocated by the Japan 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation are treated as public money and 
acts that can be misunderstood are strictly forbidden. In 
addition, this is supposedly supervised rigorously by the 
Ministry of Transport. 
  Why has the Ministry of Transport ignored this situation? 
Actually, it is a circumstance where it can only be believed 
that the Ministry of Transport also adheres. 
<H5>  Golf With 11 From Transport Ministry Vice Minister on Down </H5>
  An informed source of the Foundation says, "Our jurisdiction 
is the Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau of the Ministry of 
Transport, but that is a technical officer position. Chief 
Managing Director Yohei says, `It is the administrative officer, 
not the technical officer, who has power. In the future, we must 
get close to the Transport Policy Bureau or future candidates 
for administrative vice minister.'" 
  For that reason, on 9 August 1992, Yohei invited Ministry of 
Transport bureaucrats to golf at the Fuji Sakura Country Club. 
There were a total of 11 people participating: 
  Administrative Vice Minister Toru Nakamura 
  Transport Councilor Kiyoshi Terashima 
  Secretary General Minoru Toyoda 
  Senior Councilor Hideaki Mukaiyama 
  Director, Transport Policy Bureau, Hideo Otsuka 
  Director, Road Transport Bureau, Yasutoshi Tsuchisaka 
  Director, Maritime Transport Bureau, Yoshitoshi Asami 
  Director, Ports and Harbors Bureau, Masaaki Uemura 
  Director, Civil Aviation Bureau, Michihiko Matsuo 
  Director, Documents Section, Shogo Arai 
  Director, Seafarers Department, Masakazu Nagao 
  It is a prominent line-up. All of them should be called the 
central officers of the Transport Ministry. 
  Looking at the list which forms "the car preparation report" 
for the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation from the Ministry 
of Transport and the "8 August (Saturday) Car Dispatch 
Allocation Preparation List" that the foundation prepared upon 
its receipt, which I have obtained, it is learned that they went 
the day before to Yohei's villa in Yamanashi Prefecture, riding 
separately in four foundation cars and two hired cars 
chartered by the foundation, spent one night there, and then met 
for golf. Naturally, they had a reception at the villa and the 
return home probably was similar. Isn't this unprecedented 
"entertainment"? 
  How does the Ministry of Transport respond? It was Maritime 
Technology and Safety Bureau Director Toda who replied. 
  " I have been told that they all went. I also received an 
invitation, but didn't go because of business. Such golf parties 
are not routine, but it seems like there have been several so 
far. They probably went because it would be rude to refuse. I 
believe that it is within the scope of etiquette." 
  Furthermore, in regards to matching the schedule of 11 
officers, "It probably was planned a long time ago. Oh yes, it 
was golf at the beginning of August, wasn't it?. Everyone clears 
their schedule before the Bon festival." 
  The common sense of the Ministry of Transport must be 
doubted. I asked a bureau director-level bureaucrat about "the 
scope of etiquette." He was speechless. 
  "Entertainment of so many people normally is impossible. It 
is not common sense. It will end up becoming a big problem," he 
said. 
  Can they really say that they are supervising the Japan 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation in this manner? 
  He had hold of politicians and the Ministry of Transport. 
Did 
he think that now there was nothing to fear? Yohei rushed 
full speed into the big projects of "Hotel Kaiyo" and "Boatopia 
Himeji" which were to be the symbol of the start of the "second 
Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation era" which was his own 
aim, and these were much bigger projects than the scale of 
previous projects. 
  "Hotel Kaiyo" opened in October 1992. 
  Total construction cost was about 25 billion yen. It is a 
building with 23 floors above ground and four below ground. It 
has a rather splendid appearance and soars up unexpectedly in 
the shopping district of Shin Okubo. A panoramic view of the 
neighboring Kanto prefectures is possible from the bar lounge on 
the 22d floor. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Once Permission Is Given, It Is Unrestricted </H5>
  The issues are the following two points. 
  According to an inside source, "One point is that a request 
for a subsidy was made to the Japan Shipbuilding Industry 
Foundation from the Marine Foundation with the objective of 
repairing the Ship Science Museum, and the funds that were 
granted were transferred into the "Hotel Kaiyo" building fund, 
which is a special account. Moreover, it was not just for a 
single fiscal year. Looking at the statement, that transfer of 
money was continued for four consecutive years with 2.63 billion 
yen in fiscal 1990, 2 billion yen in fiscal 1991, 2 billion yen 
in fiscal 1992, and 1,395 million yen in fiscal 1993. 
  "Furthermore, the second point is that 3 billion yen 
borrowed 
from the general account is different in pretext from the time 
of application. It was a project, including provision of the 
infrastructure, for the permanent anchorage and display of the 
"Yotei Maru," an Aomori-Hakodate ferry boat that already had 
been purchased, in the waters in front of the Ship Science 
Museum." 
  In other words, it was this. 
  A subsidy that was received under the pretext of a public 
works project was applied to the construction expenses for the 
"Hotel Kaiyo" every year. 
  Moreover, the foundations involved with this hotel are all 
controlled by the Sasagawa family. I would like you to look at 
the following: 
  Marine Foundation chairman, Ryoichi Sasagawa; chief managing 
director, Eichi Kamiyama; director, Yohei Sasagawa. 
  SO Foundation chairman, Ryoichi Sasagawa; director, Yohei 
Sasagawa (former chief managing director). 
  Upon further investigation, we find that these foundations 
were all established with subsidies from the Japan Shipbuilding 
Industry Foundation. It goes without saying that Yohei, the 
chief managing director, is the one who holds real power in the 
Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. 
  This means that Sasagawa-affiliated foundations poured money 
from the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, from right to 
left, like a tunnel company, to raise construction funds for the 
"Hotel Kaiyo." It is no different from a money-laundering scheme 
by the Sasagawa family. It can be said that the "Hotel Kaiyo" 
was created with grant money from the Japan Shipbuilding 
Industry Foundation, which supposedly require strict 
examination.. I reiterate, Yohei controls the strategic 
positions in that flow. 
  Moreover, the amount of the subsidy granted to foundations 
by 
the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation normally is said to 
be 1 billion and some yen in both the welfare sector and 
special cases. The amount for the Marine Foundation alone is 
very large. 
  How was such a thing done? Subsidies from the Japan 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation need the permission of the 
Ministry of Transport at the time of application. What about the 
check system of the Ministry of Transport? A very interesting 
fact came out upon investigation. 
  "When you want to transfer a subsidy once it has been 
granted, you don't use it and leave it in a pool and you can 
make a project change at the end of the fiscal year. This change 
can be made just by a settlement inside the Japan Shipbuilding 
Industry Foundation." 
  In other words, regardless of the pretext, once permission 
is 
given and the subsidy comes out, they change the object of fund 
use. It becomes what is called ex post facto approval by the 
Ministry of Transport. 
  The Marine Foundation "was inspected by the Ministry of 
Transport twice regarding construction objective, purport of 
construction, fund procurement, contracts, and payment. Since it 
passed everything in February and March this year and received a 
license, I believe that there won't be any problem. The reason 
for two inspections was that, being cautious, the Ministry of 
Transport wanted to inspect with another set of personnel. The 
General Affairs Section of the Maritime Technology and Safety 
Bureau was in charge" ( Yasuki Tobita, acting general manager, 
Marine Foundation "Hotel Kaiyo"). 
  The Ministry of Transport responds thus, "We were shown in 
advance the details of the fund allowance. We do not think that 
there is a problem. As for the transfer from the general 
account, it was just a transfer to the "Hotel Kaiyo" in the form 
of a temporary loan of the subsidy obtained from the Japan 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation with the objective of improving 
the environment of the Ship Science Museum. That is because it 
was involved with the Marine Subcenter of Tokyo Plan, the 
construction was delayed from the outset and ended up not being 
used for that reason. We approved it in advance and do not 
believe that there is any problem. Since it is effective use of 
funds within the same foundation, the method of use is not 
strange, but it probably will be a problem if they do not return 
it" (Director Toda, Maritime Technology and Safety Bureau). 
  However, I wonder what the Ministry of Transport thinks of 
using a subsidy under a certain pretext and transferring it 
elsewhere and continuing to do that for over four years. 
  It could be understood if some subsidies were transferred to 
another project just for a year. However, how can you explain a 
subsidy that is given under the same pretext every year and 
changed to the same project every year? The misunderstanding 
cannot be avoided that the large, excessive flow of money to the 
"Hotel Kaiyo" is a juggling of the books. Why wasn't the 
transfer of that portion to another public works project 
considered? 
  It is not a matter that it should be returned as the 
Ministry 
of Transport says. The moral responsibility for a method of 
granting subsidies that can be misunderstood must be brought to 
question. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Bride Also Was Introduced </H5>
  [Kaga] Please explain the reason for the disciplinary 
dismissal of Kano on 26 May. 
  [Sasagawa] You can't do a disciplinary dismissal half-way. 
It 
is now pending in court. Since it is an issue of a person's 
honor, we cannot say anything. 
  [Kaga] But, a disciplinary dismissal is like a sentence of 
death for a white collar worker. 
  [Sasagawa] No, since he is a man of considerable wealth, I 
don't think that he will have trouble eating. 
  [Kaga] Some see the recent strife as an internal feud of the 
Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation. 
  [Sasagawa] I don't know why you would say a feud. The 
organization is not split into two. If you look at events, there 
is only the matter of one capable staff member having a 
disciplinary dismissal. If you call it a feud when one person 
does bad things, then that probably is the word, but I don't 
believe so. 
  [Kaga] Was there a secret agreement with the Ministry of 
Transport on creating a "coup d'etat" on 27 May? 
  [Sasagawa] I know that such a thing was floating around as a 
rumor and it became an interesting and amusing story, but it 
probably doesn't merit comment. 
  (At this point, there was still time to get responses and I 
directed the questions to the two allegations.) 
  [Kaga] Why did you build such a lavish "Hotel Kaiyo"? 
  [Sasagawa] Actually, there have been few facilities recently 
for students making a school excursion to Tokyo to stay, and 
since it would not be good in terms of education to complete a 
school excursion without seeing Tokyo, I wanted to build such a 
thing. Since regional hotels and facilities recently have 
improved, we decided to rebuild. Whether it is lavish or not is 
a subjective issue. There is a total of 12,200 tsubo and the 
total construction cost was 25 billion. Since the tsubo unit 
price construction cost was 1.6 million, we do not believe that 
is so lavish. 
  [Kaga] However, is it permissible to transfer a special 
account to the general account? 
  [Sasagawa] Since it is efficient use of funds within the 
foundation, there isn't any problem, is there? Since 
construction was delayed on the Tokyo Subcenter, we just 
borrowed it to use because a money surplus was created for a 
year or a year and a half. 
  [Kaga] What process is undergone for the procedure of 
transferring money? 
  [Sasagawa] The process is that first, a Marine Science 
Promotion Foundation board of directors meeting is held, 
approved items are brought to the Japan Shipbuilding Industry 
Foundation, and there are discussions with the person in charge 
of title one grant money at the Shipbuilding Industry 
Foundation. Then if approval is made, it is brought to the one 
in charge at the Ministry of Transport to get their 
understanding. 
  [Kaga] Allegations have been whispered about "Boatopia 
Himeji" also... 
  [Sasagawa] We wanted a low-interest loan to do work on 
expanding the off-site boat ticket sales offices, and the first 
was "Boatopia Himeji." Fuji Rex is a company where I was an 
administrator a long time ago. We decided that we should have 
them do it and created it by persuading a great opposition 
movement. Now it is much appreciated by the shopping district, 
we are increasing the days that it is open and it seems that it 
is changing to cooperate for the benefit of the shopping 
district. 
  [Kaga] It is said that there is a deep connection between 
you 
and Fuji Rex. Should it be called your company? 
  [Sasagawa] It is a company where I worked for a portion of 
my 
youth since I served as administrator at the age of 32. I have 
had a very friendly acquaintance with Fujita and also was made 
an officer of Nihon Hikosen. Moreover, it is a fact that when I 
heard that the performance of the company had not been that good 
and they needed funds, I wanted to help. He also introduced me 
to my bride. However, he now is retiring. 
  [Kaga] It seems that Fuji Rex is thinking about opening a 
chain of off-site boat ticket sales office with Store No. 2 and 
Store No. 3, but why is it centered on Fuji Rex? 
  [Sasagawa] There is a head office promoting Boatopia 
nationwide and there are about 70 or 80 companies that want to 
build them now. Among them, the only ones that by chance are 
bearing fruit at the present point in time are the three 
locations of Himeji, Kure, and Akita. Major firms also have said 
that they want to participate in the future. It does not means 
that other businesses cannot participate because Fuji Rex is 
doing it. 
  [Kaga] There are a lot of Fuji Rex staff members at the 
Marine Foundation. 
  [Sasagawa] They are people who have been employed because 
they said they wanted to be devoted to hotel management over 20 
years ago when I joined Fuji Travel as an administrator. 
  [Kaga] Was financing initially a part of the modernized 
center concept? 
  [Sasagawa] It was from the start. 
  [Kaga] Last year, weren't the regulations revised to make 
financing possible for the first time? 
  [Sasagawa] No, since government offices proceed with work in 
order, it only was approved in order. 
  [Kaga] At the Fuji Sakura Country Club on 9 August last 
year, 
you played golf with 11 prominent members of the Ministry of 
Transport bureaucracy. Moreover, hired cars were sent to get 
them from the Foundation and they all stayed at your villa. 
  [Sasagawa] Wasn't it seven or eight? It is a fact that we 
played golf. It is also a fact that we used foundation cars. 
However, our chairman is very strict, and the entertainment 
expenses for the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation are 16 million 
in all. Therefore, it is a fact that I personally invited them 
at my own expense, but it is only once a year. 
  [Kaga] Is it an annual custom? 
  [Sasagawa] No, it's not. It was a one-time courtesy thing 
last year and the year before last. I suppose you might have a 
good image when you hear a villa, but I and my wife laid out 
the bedding and they all slept together in a group.... 
  [Kaga] You said it was personal, but drivers were hired. 
  [Sasagawa] They were borrowed (from the foundation). 
  [Kaga] Did you use your pocket money for their wages too? 
  [Sasagawa] Since they are drivers that belong to the staff 
of 
the foundation, I do not pay. 
<H5>  "This Is Awful Information" </H5>
  (He seemed to assume a threatening attitude and asked what 
was wrong with have a reception for government officials. What 
about another alliance, his connections with the political 
world?) 
  [Kaga] Are there requests from politicians for approval of 
subsidies? 
  [Sasagawa] Ryoichi Sasagawa has a better reputation to 
respond specifically to such a thing. It is a famous story, but 
long ago he asked, "Have any requests come from kith or kin?" 
When I said, "This and this have come," he said to remove those 
unconditionally. That is the way we have come to do business. 
  In the words of Ryoichi Sasagawa, "Our work is a job that 
makes 10 people happy and 90 people enemies. We are thanked by 
the people who receive, but the many people who are left off say 
that Ryoichi Sasagawa is disgraceful." It is only the 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation that so long as the case is 
good, it is the same whether or not it is particularly 
introduced by someone, and that is not involved with Diet 
members. 
  [Kaga] You said that it would be rejected just by seeing the 
name of kith or kin, but among the grant projects in fiscal 1988 
is a welfare facility mediated by Takashi Sasagawa. In the case 
of the chairman, is it just when seeing the name of Takashi that 
he does not say, "No good."? 
  [Sasagawa] Naturally, he says it. 
  [Kaga] I have heard that when you became chief managing 
director, political schemes were necessary and your have 
permitted applications with ties to politicians or ordered 
mediating politicians to express thanks. 
  [Sasagawa] There is no reason for that. 
  [Kaga] Don't you do confirmation work as to whether or not 
thanks have come by phone? 
  [Sasagawa] That is not so. 
  [Kaga] Would you take a look at this (look at "thanks list" 
in this article)? I believe that this is a request to get proper 
thanks. 
  [Sasagawa] That is not so. 
  [Kaga] But this has been checked as to whether someone 
mediated and whether there were proper thanks regarding projects 
with strings attached. In other words, isn't it the exact 
opposite of what you said now? 
  [Sasagawa] It is a fact that there have been telephone calls 
(from politicians). They ask to be informed if anything 
happens... 
  [Kaga] Looking at the items on this list, there is, for 
example, the item of ranking. There are no numbers, but viewed 
generally, this is something which you cannot help saying has 
strings attached. 
  [Sasagawa] That is a matter of if it were to come, it would 
be nice that it came. I don't think that it is necessary to make 
a list of whether or not telephone calls of thanks came from 
Diet members. This is just a matter of my secretary writing down 
the telephone calls received. 
  (To the chief of the No. 2 Operations Department) We are now 
talking about the philosophy of the chairman. In the 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation, the chairman determines 
whether a case is good or bad, no matter who requests it. When I 
explain that it is not that it was done or not done because it 
was requested by a Diet member, he says aren't we dealing with 
so many cases that involve politicians. I have not seen this 
information. 
  Chief of No. 2 Operations Department: We in the No. 2 
Operations Department undertake consultation on applications. 
Naturally, we consult with local autonomous bodies, and 
distinguished members of the Diet and the local community. Since 
there are cases where the private secretary seems to be in 
charge together with us, there are cases where we make up a list 
of them. An examination cannot be made by the administration if 
the details are not definite. The reason is that we have to 
create rigid criteria. 
  [Sasagawa] I am just bragging. Compared to others, the 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation has extremely little 
involvement with politicians. 
  Chief of No. 2 Operations Department: Your use of such 
expressions such as involvement is causing problem, chief 
managing director. That is because when asked by people who do 
not understand this system, they take it to mean that it is 
controlled by them. 
  [Kaga] No one is saying that this information is a forgery. 
We have confirmed that there were thanks from Diet members. 
Actually, it would not be necessary to create information that 
includes the names of Diet members if had no effect. 
  [Sasagawa] We don't need this. I am amazed. This is awful 
information. 
  Chief of No. 2 Operations Department: As a supervisor, I 
believe that it is a little different from whether this or that 
information created by the person in charge is not needed. I

<H5>  Contradiction in Yohei Sasagawa's Ambitions </H5>
  (He appeared considerably flustered. Inherently, the 
occurrence of this internal feud was due to the weakening of his 
father Ryoichi.) 
  [Kaga] What about the health of the chairman? 
  [Sasagawa] He laughed when I mentioned it (rumors of serious 
illness) to him. He still walks on his own feet. He doesn't need 
a hearing aid or eyeglasses for the old. We recently had a 
birthday party at the "Hotel Kaiyo" just for the family, but I 
led in the toasting and when I said, "They always say that the 
chairman will live until he is 200 years old, so please excuse 
us ordinary people if we precede you," he shouted loudly, "What 
foolish talk. You will live to be 200 years old too." In view of 
his age, I think that he is exceedingly healthy. 
  [Kaga] I heard that there was opposition within the family 
when you were appointed chief managing director. 
  [Sasagawa] That is not true. In fact, my older brother is 
taking the path of the politician. 
  [Kaga] What do you think about the inheritance system? 
  [Sasagawa] Honestly speaking, I think that it is the issue 
of 
a successor, but the successor is decided by the board of 
directors. Since there are people who have insight on the board 
of directors, I cannot be one just because I want to be it. I 
am putting all my effort into seriously doing the job that I now 
have been given. My interest is filial piety and I have been 
working by considering what would be best for Ryoichi Sasagawa. 
  [Kaga] Yohei responded to the interview in the office of the 
managing director at the Shipbuilding Industry Foundation for 
about two hours. 
  He is a man small in stature who resembles Ryoichi Sasagawa. 
He had a constant smile on his face. . His voice was sonorous 
and seemingly eloquent. 
  His expression changed when I showed him the aforementioned 
"list of thanks." His expression up to that point vanished and 
he bent his head and was silent for a while. 
  The two projects that are proceeding through the good 
offices 
of Yohei are his strategic preparation for inheritance. 
Moreover, the fact that Yohei has gotten close to politicians 
and the Ministry of Transport is to cover the influence that is 
far inferior to his father and to have those inside the 
Shipbuilding Industry Foundation as well as the Sasagawa family 
approve his "inheritance." However, there is a big 
contradiction. The closer he gets to the Ministry of Transport, 
the stronger will be the voice of the Ministry of Transport, and 
the farther will be the path toward control by the Sasagawa 
family, or in other words, to his "inheritance" and it might 
inevitably be linked to a special corporation like horse racing 
or cycle racing. 
  Solidifying his position in the Sasagawa family and placing 
the Sasagawa empire under his control truly are nothing but a 
contradiction. Does Yohei really realize that contradiction? 
  The motorboat racing world is an empire that has been 
maintained because of the very fact that it was Ryoichi 
Sasagawa. When the problem of Sasagawa's health was born, the 
collapse of the empire was inevitable.

<F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>
  [Text] Washington, Jan. 24 KYODO -- U.S. and Japanese 
officials charged with drafting a progress report on framework 
trade talks completed their first-day meeting Monday [24 
January], with both sides clamping a tight lid on the 
negotiating process. The report, set to spell out the terms of 
how to "significantly increase" foreign access and sales to key 
Japanese markets, is due to be completed by the February 11 
summit between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  "We are still in the midst of negotiations," said a Japanese 
official who briefed reporters on the day's plenary session 
between Japanese and U.S. principals in charge of the framework 
negotiations. 
  The Japanese spokesman said the two sides agreed not to 
discuss matters of substance before the current round of trade 
talks is over, possibly by Wednesday. "Each side presented a 
status report, and we exchanged views," the official said. 
  There were, however, indications that there was no 
significant breakthrough. "We still have a lot of work to do," 
Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Roger Altman told after emerging 
from the day's session at the White House conference center. 
  A U.S. official who gave a separate briefing to Japanese 
reporters said the day's talks focused on the issue of 
"objective criteria," the heart of contention between Tokyo and 
Washington. "There is still a big gap between us here," said 
the official, who made a point of conducting the briefing in 
Japanese. 
  The United States, which runs a 50 billion dollar trade 
deficit with Japan, has insisted that Japan accept the import 
levels of other industrial countries as the norm that it must 
emulate. Japanese officials have rejected the U.S. demand, 
arguing that setting import targets is anathema to free trade. 
  U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said Monday the U.S. will 
insist on taking "a targeted, results-oriented approach" in 
seeking trade concessions from Tokyo. 
  "I think that is going to make a real difference" in U.S. 
trade ties with Japan, Brown said at a news conference. 
  The meeting between the high-powered U.S. delegation and 
Japanese negotiators came a day after U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen warned Tokyo that Washington may reexamine the 
basis of trade relations with Japan if no breakthrough is made 
in the framework trade talks. 
  Laura Tyson, head of the White House Council of Economic 
Advisers, was also at the negotiation table Monday. 
  Tyson told reporters after the meeting that she was taking 
part in the trade talks as an observer. "This is an area I have 
given a lot of thought about," said Tyson, who has written a 
book on trade conflicts in high-technology industries between 
Japan and the U.S. 
  The U.S. negotiating team also included Ezra Vogel, a 
leading 
Japan expert and a senior official of the Central Intelligence 
Agency's National Intelligence Council. 
  The Japanese negotiating team, headed by Deputy Foreign 
Minister Koichiro Matsuura, included officials from the Foreign 
Ministry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and 
the Finance Ministry.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii stressed the need Tuesday [25 January] for Japan to 
explain the economic measures it is taking at the Japan-U.S. 
summit in Washington on February 11. 
  "It's important for Japan to show its political and economic 
policies to President (Bill) Clinton in the sense of Japan-U.S. 
friendship," Fujii told reporters after a morning cabinet 
meeting. "That includes economic problems," he stressed, 
indicating that Japan would compile a stimulus package by the 
time the summit is held. But he noted that a timetable for both 
the package and budget is "still not decided." 
  Fujii reiterated that he and U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen agreed at a meeting Sunday that a recovery of the 
Japanese economy is "extremely important" especially in view of 
contributions to world growth [sentence as received]. He said 
he told Bentsen to "trust us" and leave the details of measures 
to Japan. 
  As six ministers responsible for economic affairs, including 
Fujii, agreed on Monday, he said the government is to focus on 
reviving the political reform bills rejected by the House of 
Councillors last Friday, and the enactment of those bills would 
be the best help now for the economy. 
  He said his ministry is not considering any measures for the 
stock market. Tokyo stock prices recovered slightly Tuesday 
morning after a key market index, the Nikkei stock average, 
plummeted 954 points Monday, its biggest in two years. 
  Meanwhile, Fujii rejected Tuesday's comments by Economic 
Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota calling for an 
income tax cut separately from an increase in the consumption 
tax. 
  "That's her personal opinion," Fujii said, adding that a 
decision on the tax issue is being left to a joint economic 
forum of the government and the coalition parties. 
  The ministry has been maintaining that the income tax cut 
and 
consumption tax hike must be included in the same package of tax 
reform bills to guarantee repayment of "bridge" bonds issued to 
cover the period until the tax hike. 
  Concerning reported plans to stimulate the real estate 
market 
and facilitate liquidation of banks' bad loans on which interest 
has been reduced, Fujii said the ministry is now studying 
various measures including "securitization" of loans and is in 
"the final stage" of mapping out its plan.

  [Text] The Kadena Town government monitors the noise 
produced by aircraft takeoffs and landings at Kadena Air Base. 
It has been learned that the frequency of noise in 1993 was 
significantly lower than in the previous year. 
  The Kadena Town government uses a gauge set up on top of the 
town hall building to monitor the frequency of noise over 70 
phons lasting more than 5 seconds. Data from the monitoring 
effort for 1993 has been compiled recently. 
  According to the statistics, noise was recorded 19,069 times 
last year, more than 3,000 times less than the 22,746 times 
recorded in 1992. Kadena Town's records show that noise was 
recorded more than 38,000 times at its peak in 1984, and the 
frequency of noise has been declining since then. 
  Regarding the improvement in the frequency of noise, the 
Kadena Town government says that one of the reasons might be the 
departure of 18 F-15 fighters based in Kadena by December 1992. 
  Seiyu Nakamura, vice chairman of the plaintiffs' group in 
the 
Kadena noise case, where a verdict is expected on 24 February, 
says: Although the frequency of noise monitored has declined 
numerically, we do not actually feel any improvement. The 
adverse effect on our daily life remains the same.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 23 KYODO -- A coalition of civic groups 
opposed to high noise levels at U.S. military bases in Japan has 
decided not to appeal a U.S. federal court's dismissal of its 
original lawsuit last November, coalition representatives said 
Sunday [23 January]. 
  The representatives of the NEPA [National Environmental 
Protection Act] coalition filed suit three years ago with a U.S. 
court calling for environmental impact studies to be undertaken 
at the U.S. military facilities at Atsugi and Yokosuka in 
Kanagawa Prefecture and Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture. 
  They had called for the study to be ordered in accordance 
with the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), a U.S. 
law that requires environmental impact studies on federal 
projects. 
  But the U.S. federal district court in Washington ruled last 
November that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing in seeking 
remedies from U.S. courts. The ruling followed the U.S. Navy 
counsel's argument that NEPA does not extend to overseas U.S. 
military operations. 
  NEPA coalition representatives said the decision was taken 
because the chances of an appeals court overturning the November 
ruling appeared dim. 
  They said the coalition would continue seeking ways to get 
the U.S. Navy to reduce noise emitted by planes simulating 
carrier landings and takeoffs at the airfield.

  [Text] New York, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Japan supports an 
indefinite, unconditional extension of the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) beyond its 1995 expiration since 
it will promote peaceful use of nuclear power, its ambassador in 
charge of disarmament said Friday [21 January]. 
  Yoshitomo Tanaka made the remarks in a speech at the U.N. 
headquaters at a meeting of the preliminary committee preparing 
for a 1995 international conference to discuss extension of the 
pact. 
  As reasons for Japan's support, Tanaka noted the treaty 
calls 
for nuclear powers to reduce nuclear arms and promotes the 
prevention of nuclear proliferation, a major concern in the 
post-Cold War era. 
  The NPT, which came into force in 1970, requires nuclear 
powers to sincerely promote disarmament talks and bans 
nonnuclear states from producing or possessing nuclear arms. 
  Japan became party to the NPT in 1975. 
  The preliminary committee was set up to promote 
working-level 
consultations before an international conference in 1995. 
  So far, 60 countries have expressed support for unlimited 
extension of the treaty. 
  But nonaligned nations, mostly Asian and African developing 
countries, have demanded that revisions be made in the treaty's 
clauses and that extension be set for a limited period, saying 
the treaty is discriminatory between nuclear powers and 
nonnuclear countries. 
  A majority of support with 162 signatories is needed to 
extend the treaty.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 Kyodo -- Russia has declined a 
Japanese offer to supply a tanker for temporary storage of its 
excess nuclear waste, saying the tanker's facilities are 
inadequate, government sources said Friday [21 January]. 
  Japan made the offer last month in response to a Russian 
call 
for assistance so that it would not have to dispose of the waste 
at sea following protests from Japan over the ocean disposal of 
900 tons of liquid nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan in October. 
The dumping caused an international furor. 
  At Russo-Japanese talks at the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo on 
December 21, Russia proposed the use of a tanker. 
  The Russian side said at the time that it was storing about 
1,900 tons of liquid radioactive waste in four vessels and other 
facilities around Vladivostok, but needed help in finding 
storage space for an additional 5,000 to 25,000 tons of the 
waste. 
  An estimated 5,000 tons of liquid radioactive waste are 
generated annually in Russia as a result of the dismantling of 
nuclear-powered submarines. 
  Japan later offered a Panamanian-registered tanker, but the 
sources said that after three Russian experts inspected the 
vessel in Singapore, they concluded it was not properly equipped 
to store radioactive waste. 
  Instead, Russia will store the waste in a vessel acquired 
locally. 
  The vessel can only store a limited volume of waste and 
Japanese government officials say they will eventually have to 
face the prospect of assisting Russia to build on-land storage 
facilities for the waste.

  [Text] Sapporo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Japan should not expect 
rapid progress in resolving its territorial dispute with Russia 
considering the unstable internal political situation in that 
country, a senior Foreign Ministry official said here Thursday 
[20 January]. 
  "Looking at the relationship between President (Boris) 
Yeltsin and the Russian Parliament, we cannot expect rapid 
progress on the northern territories issue," said Issei Nomura, 
director general of the ministry's European and Oceanian Affairs 
Bureau, in a speech at a Sapporo Hotel. Nomura was apparently 
referring to Yeltsin's troubles with anti-reform 
ultranationalists who won big in last month's parliamentary 
elections. 
  The Ultranationalists strongly oppose Japan's demand that 
Russia transfer to its sovereignty the four islands, which were 
seized by Soviet Forces at the end of World War II. Japan calls 
the Islands -- Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai 
group -- its northern territories, while Russia refers to them 
as the South Kurils. 
  Nomura said that in the absence of an atmosphere conducive 
to 
major progress, Japan and Russia should work to improve their 
relations on the basis of the Tokyo declaration signed during 
Yeltsin's visit to Japan last October. He said the two 
countries should also further promote exchanges of visits 
between Russian residents of the disputed islands and Japanese 
from Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island. 
  The exchanges, which have taken place over the past two 
years, are aimed at increasing mutual understanding between the 
two sides and conditioning Russian residents in advance of a 
future territorial settlement.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- Japan and Russia will hold 
a third round of working-level talks on a bilateral territorial 
dispute on February 21 and 22 in Moscow, Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Terusuke Terada said Tuesday. 
  The meeting in Moscow will be the first about the 
long-standing territorial dispute since Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin visited Japan last October. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda will attend the 
meeting, while Vice Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov will 
represent Russia, Terada said. Terada declined to comment on 
the possible agenda for discussions at the two-day meeting, 
saying the Japanese and Russian Governments are currently 
working it out through diplomatic channels. 
  Japan claims four Russian-held islands off northeastern 
Hokkaido. The former Soviet Union seized Shikotan, Kunashiri, 
Etorofu and the Habomai Islets at the end of World War II. 
  Tokyo and Moscow originally scheduled the working-level 
talks 
for January, but postponed them at Russia's request.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- China last year emerged as 
Japan's second largest trading partner after the United States, 
the government-backed Japan External Organization (Jetro) 
reported Monday [24 January]. 
  China was fifth on the 1992 list of Japan's major trading 
partners. 
  Japan-China trade in 1993 grew 30.9 percent from the 
previous 
year to 37,844 million dollars, renewing an annual record for 
the third consecutive year, Jetro said. 
  Japan's trade with the U.S. last year totaled 160.5 billion 
dollars. 
  Chinese statistics showed Japan was China's largest trading 
partner last year, with two-way trade amounting to 39 billion 
dollars, Jetro said. 
  Japan's 1993 exports to China surged 44.6 percent from the 
previous year to 17,281 million dollars, Jetro said. Passenger 
car exports increased 2.5 times and communications equipment 
exports, including telephones, doubled. 
  Japan's imports from China advanced 21.3 percent to 20,563 
million dollars. Apparel imports rose 30.0 percent and 
vegetable imports surged 42.0 percent, due to poor crops in 
Japan. 
  Jetro forecast Japan-China trade this year will surpass 40 
billion dollars, with imports steadily increasing despite an 
expected slowdown in exports due to China's import restraints.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Nippon Steel Corp. said 
Monday [24 January] it has agreed to conduct a feasibility study 
on a 90 million dollar tin-plated steel manufacturing project in 
Guangzhou, China. The project, which involves two Japanese 
partners and three Chinese entities, could mark the first 
steel-manufacturing project in China involving Japanese capital. 
  The other participants in the project include Mitsui and Co. 
and Itochu Corp., two of Japan's giant trading houses, the 
Guangzhou city's Light Industry Bureau and a Special Economic 
and Technical Zone in the city, Nippon Steel said. 
  The project calls for producing 120,000 tons of tin plates a 
year for cans. Nippon Steel said it expects to make a decision 
on whether to go ahead with the project by this spring.

  [Text] Dhaka, Jan. 21 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
will contribute 3.6 million dollars to the office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for its 
repatriation program for Myanmar [Burma] refugees from 
Bangladesh, the Japanese embassy in Dhaka said Thursday [20 
January]. 
  Japan donated 1 million dollars in 1992 to help the nearly 
quarter of a million refugees who fled to Bangladesh to avoid 
ethnic persecution in Myanmar. 
  The UNHCR is seeking donations totaling 34 million dollars 
for the repatriation program. 
  With Wednesday's repatriation of 28 refugees, known as 
Rohingyas, the total number of those returned voluntarily to 
Myanmar stood at 52,298. 
  The Muslim refugees fled to Bangladesh in 1991 and 
repatriation began in September 1992. 
  The Bangladesh news agency BSS reported that about 200,000 
refugees remain in 20 camps in southeastern Bangladesh, which 
borders Myanmar.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- The government decided 
Tuesday [25 January] to lift all remaining restrictions on 
exports to South Africa in response to that country's 
dismantling of apartheid. 
  The decision eliminates all economic sanctions against South 
Africa with the exception of a blanket ban on the export of 
weapons to all countries. 
  The decision, effective from January 28, will release for 
export a range of previously restricted products including 
computers and four-wheel-drive vehicles for use by the South 
African military and police forces. 
  The government has already lifted bans on flights between 
Japan and South Africa and on investment in that country. 
  A new South African Constitution, drawn up after two years 
of 
negotiations, guarantees a formal end to the legalized system of 
racial discrimination known as apartheid following the nation's 
first all-race elections on April 27.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 22 KYODO -- A rough ride is expected 
for the dollar next week as the political turmoil unleashed 
Friday [21 January] hurts the yen but boosts political pressure 
for a weak dollar. 
  Dealers expect stocks and market interest rates to tumble, 
at 
least initially, in the wake of Friday's crushing defeat for 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's political reform package. 
  Fundamentally, that spells trouble for the yen, but with 
hopes receding for the preoccupied government to craft speedy 
economic stimulus measures, fundamentals may take a back seat to 
international politics, dealers said. 
  That thinking drove the dollar lower in Europe after the 
reform vote in the House of Councillors, which followed the 
Tokyo close. It dipped briefly to a one-month low below 110 yen 
in London, but was bought back afterward on perceptions that it 
had been oversold and closed at 111.10-20 yen. It later 
finished in New York at 111.55-65 yen. 
  In Tokyo, the U.S. currency declined 0.45 yen for the week 
to 
111.30 yen, wavering in a range of less than 1 yen as the market 
awaited the reform vote. 
  The U.S. Government has been withholding high-yen pressure 
to 
give the young Hosokawa coalition a chance to cut Japan's trade 
deficit by expanding domestic demand and thus boosting imports, 
Tokyo dealers say. 
  With such fiscal hopes on the rocks, they believe, America 
may pull the monetary lever, talking the yen up to make Japanese 
imports cheaper in yen terms and putting the heat on Japan's 
exporters by forcing export prices up in other currency terms. 
  "We have to pay more attention to the politics from now on," 
said Takao Sako, head of yen trading at the Union Bank of 
Switzerland. But the result for the currency market will be 
"very unpredictable," he said. 
  With U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen holding hastily 
arranged meetings Sunday in Tokyo with Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii and Hosokawa, players wondered if Washington would play 
the "high-yen card" before February's bilateral summit. 
  Adding to the pressure were Friday's report of a record 120 
billion dollar 1993 Japanese trade surplus, stalled bilateral 
trade talks and President Bill Clinton calling Japan one of "our 
biggest problems" on trade. 
  Washington "won't allow a weaker yen," said Junichi Kodama, 
a 
Chemical Bank vice president and head of corporate foreign 
exchange sales. 
  He predicted a test of chart-based technical support in the 
109 yen range next week with any rebounds curbed at 111 yen. 
  The chance for dollar declines is building, but "we just 
can't predict," said dealer Yuko Fukakusa at Tokai Bank. 
  Chief dealer Toru Itami at Yasuda Trust and Banking Co. said 
that after the market's first reaction to sell the dollar, it 
may recall the apparently steady U.S. recovery as compared with 
Japan, where the Bank of Japan said Friday that recession 
continues and "any salient economic recovery is still at a 
distance."

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 23 KYODO -- The governing coalition's 
proposal to revive major parts of a political reform package by 
convening a 20-member joint parliamentary conference may 
collapse due to growing criticism from some Liberal Democratic 
Party lawmakers, LDP officials said Sunday [23 January]. 
  The coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
has been pleading with the LDP to agree to convene the 
two-chamber consultative body comprising 10 legislators each 
from the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. 
  In a meeting with reporters, Hosokawa hinted that he would 
explore the possibility of arriving at a compromise on political 
reform bills through the proposed joint panel. 
  The calls for the consultative body became loud after the 
upper chamber on Friday voted down Hosokawa's package calling 
for completely redesigning the mechanism for electing members of 
the powerful lower house. 
  The directors of the lower chamber's Diet Steering Committee 
from the ruling and opposition camps are slated to assemble 
Monday to discuss convening the proposed two-chamber conference, 
they said. 
  If they agree to put the proposal to set up the consultative 
body to a vote, the lower chamber will vote on the proposal 
Tuesday, coalition officials said. 
  LDP opponents of Hosokawa's package are urging the LDP 
leadership not to agree to the establishment of such a 
consultative body, saying it may open the way for formulation of 
a compromise package, they said. 
  If the lower chamber votes to ask the upper chamber to set 
up 
the consultative body, the body would immediately start talks 
for reconciling differences between the coalition's package and 
the LDP's counterproposals, the officials said. 
  Unless Hosokawa could secure LDP consent to hammer out the 
compromise package, he would be forced to observe his 
oft-repeated vow to "take the responsibility" -- an euphemism 
for disbanding the cabinet or dissolving the lower chamber, they 
said. 
  Appearing on a television program, former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe urged the LDP leadership on Sunday not to agree 
to work out a compromise package that would replace the current 
multiseat constituency system for the lower house with any 
system comprising single-seat districts.

  [Excerpt] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Ruling and opposition 
parties failed Monday to agree to set up a joint committee of 
the Diet's two houses in an effort to enact a political reform 
package that was voted down by the House of Councillors, 
political sources said. 
  The parties ended Monday night's meeting of the House of 
Representatives steering committee in a stalemate, holding over 
their negotiations to the next committee session beginning at 3 
P.M. Tuesday [25 January], they said. 
  The ruling coalition parties want to hold the joint council 
to discuss concessions on the government-sponsored reform bills, 
in a last-ditch effort to enact the legislation. 
  If two-thirds of a 20-member joint panel agree on a 
compromise plan, the amended version would then be sent before a 
plenary session of both houses of the Diet for a vote. The 
bills would then become law if they are passed by the houses 
with a majority vote. 
  If the next steering committee meeting reaches agreement to 
form the council of 10 members each from both houses, the lower 
house will then have to vote whether to hold the joint panel. 
  However, even if the joint committee is held, the ruling and 
opposition camps are unlikely to agree on a concession plan, and 
the package is likely to be then taken to the lower house for 
another vote, they said. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has said he would step 
down if he fails to get the package passed, will put the bills 
to a floor vote again at a lower house plenary session if the 
joint council ends in failure, coalition officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Just as they were seeking 
the silver lining to Japan's prolonged recession, Bank of Japan 
branch managers said Monday [24 January] they were hit with a 
downpour. 
  In Tokyo for a two-day quarterly meeting, regional central 
bank leaders said recent stock market gains were just reviving 
the spirits of corporate managers when Tokyo shares took their 
worst dive in two and a half years. 
  "I'm concerned about the impact on corporate sentiment, 
which 
had improved a bit recently as the yen stopped its appreciation 
and stock prices staged a rally in heavy volume," Osaka branch 
manager Tatsuya Tamura told a news conference. 
  The benchmark Nikkei stock average plummeted about 950 
points, or 5 percent, Monday to 18,353.24 in the wake of 
Friday's defeat of the political reform bills that Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa had staked his government on. 
  Some areas, such as export-heavy central Japan that watch 
currency rates more than stock prices, are encouraged that the 
yen's declines from earlier peaks may improve profits, said 
Nagoya Branch Manager Eiichiro Kinoshita. 
  But on the downside, he said, managers in his area have seen 
demand weaken relative to supply. 
  Overall, economic recovery will likely take time, Central 
Bank Governor Yasushi Mieno said in opening the managers' 
meeting, but he gave no hint of changing his policy stance, 
repeating that he will watch the effects of past fiscal and 
monetary actions. 
  The managers of 33 domestic branches, plus representative 
offices in New York, London and Hong Kong, opened their two-day 
meeting with reports that the economy remains mired in a slump 
with no signs of recovery visible. 
  Their reports, written before the political turmoil was 
unleashed Friday, said further setbacks are unlikely, as the 
economy is supported by reviving personal spending in some areas 
and improving corporate posture. 
  Osaka Branch Chief Tamura said his region's report may have 
to be revised, including its suggestion to monitor the effects 
of past monetary measures. 
  Mieno, unavailable to spell out his views on the political 
turmoil, is to meet the press Wednesday to wrap up the meeting. 
  The Osaka and Nagoya branch managers said in separate press 
conferences that corporate sentiment was brightening, with 
Kinoshita saying other managers expressed similar views. But 
both said the economic picture was a mix of bright and dark 
spots. 
  "The chances of the economy falling through the bottom have 
lessened," Tamura said. "The corporate mind is recovering." 
  Smaller companies are starting to "take a positive stance 
independently" instead of nervously waiting for an economic 
recovery predicted by the government, and companies are making 
"forward- looking" capital investment in such promising 
strategic businesses as multimedia, he said. 
  Mieno noted the importance of business sentiment, citing a 
drag on recovery from caution among companies and financial 
institutions, stemming from their stubborn problems in clearing 
losses incurred during the asset deflation after the collapse of 
the speculative "bubble" of the late 1980s. 
  Tamura stressed that "dark factors" have grown, expressing 
concern that companies are increasingly shifting production 
overseas, and saying more time is needed for companies to 
improve their balance sheets through restructuring. 
  Business conditions remain tough for financial institutions 
as fund demand stays weak despite low interest rates. 
  But although economists and business leaders have called for 
a cut in the Bank of Japan's already record low official 
discount rate of 1.75 percent a year, Kinoshita said fewer 
people in his area are now calling for a rate cut, perhaps 
reflecting the concerns of people on fixed incomes. 
  Among the problems around Nagoya, "a setback in the 
supply-demand area stands out," as consumer and capital spending 
lag. But "the corporate mind is settling down" with a more 
bearable exchange rate, he said. 
  A higher yen hurts Japanese exporters by making their 
products more expensive in foreign-currency terms. The yen, 
which soared last year to a postwar record 100.40 to the dollar 
in August, closed Friday at 112.10 to the dollar.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- The top adviser to Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Tuesday that Hosokawa may 
disband the cabinet and step down from power if political reform 
cannot be achieved during the current session of the Diet ending 
Saturday [29 January]. In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, 
Shusei Tanaka, special assistant to Hosokawa, said "the prime 
minister is not the type of person who seeks to cling to a 
position." 
  "The prime minister has made it his principle to live up to 
his promises. His resignation is highly possible," Tanaka said. 
Tanaka, a House of Representatives member belonging to Sakigake 
(harbinger), was apparently referring to Hosokawa's promise to 
"take the responsibility" if he failed to push the political and 
electoral reform package through the Diet by Saturday's closure. 
The pledge has been widely interpreted to mean that Hosokawa 
would resign as prime minister. 
  In the event of the killing of the reform bills, Hosokawa 
has 
the alternative of dissolving the House of Representatives for a 
snap general election, political sources say. 
  Soon after assuming the premiership last August, Hosokawa 
vowed to take the responsibility if he could not achieve 
political reform by the end of 1993. But because of delays in 
deliberations in the House of Councillors, Hosokawa extended the 
deadline to coincide with the end of the current extension of 
the Diet session. The Diet session was extended once to last 
through Saturday. 
  The upper house rejected the package last Friday. 
  Tanaka said the possibility remains that Hosokawa may opt to 
dissolve the lower chamber and call a snap general election in 
lieu of disbanding his cabinet. 
  Tanaka said, however, "the current economic situation does 
not allow for dissolution." Many economists and legislators 
say dissolving the Diet would further put off parliamentary 
passage of the fiscal 1994 state budget, needed to revive the 
floundering economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Tuesday his party cannot 
make concessions on a proposed ban on corporate donations to 
individual politicians in political reform talks. 
  "The root cause of corruption is corporate donations," he 
told a news conference. "I believe it is necessary to limit the 
flow of corporate and organizational funds to a political party 
and forbid one to individual lawmakers." 
  The SDP is the largest grouping within the seven-party 
coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. His 
remarks indicate the SDP cannot accept a call from the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to ease the planned 
ban on corporate donations to individual legislators. 
  The coalition and the LDP are likely to begin formal 
negotiations on possible modifications to government-sponsored 
political reform bills, which cleared the House of 
Representatives in November but were rejected by the House of 
Councillors on Friday [21 January]. 
  The package, aimed at rooting out rampant political graft, 
features introduction of single-seat constituencies with 
proportional representation in lower house elections and 
stricter curbs on campaign funding. 
  The coalition and the LDP have been far apart on the balance 
between single-seat districts and proportional representation as 
well as the ban on corporate and organizational donations to 
individual politicians. 
  Murayama also ruled out the possibility that Hosokawa will 
dissolve the lower house for a snap general election if he fails 
in his promise to realize reform before the current Diet session 
ends January 29. 
  "If the lower house is dissolved amid this serious economic 
slump, it will create a political vacuum," the SDP chairman 
said, adding the matter should be taken into consideration at 
least after the formulation of the national budget for fiscal 
1994, starting April 1. 
  Meanwhile, a group of 19 out of 20 SDP upper house 
legislators who voted against the government package or 
abstained from the voting last week said Tuesday they had formed 
a group intent on leading parliamentary debate to place priority 
on enacting antigraft provisions rather than on proposals to 
revamp Japan's electoral system. 
  The group said they will not send a representative to a 
20-member consultative panel comprising legislators from both 
houses, a panel that may produce a compromise version of the 
reform package. 
  Seventeen SDP members voted against the bills and three 
others abstained from voting at an upper house plenary session 
Friday.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "NHK News 7" program] </F>
  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] held its General 
Council meeting today and decided to agree to convene a joint 
committee of both houses of the Diet. At this meeting, 
pro-reform members and those advocating taking a cautious stance 
on the political reform bills engaged in heated debate for over 
three hours. 
  Sozaburo Jimi, one of those taking a cautious stance, said 
since a joint meeting of both houses is a very exceptional case, 
matters cannot be left in the hands of the party executives. 
Toshikatsu Matsuoka, another member taking a cautious stance, 
said a joint committee of both houses is a form of closed 
meeting where the public is shut out, and, therefore, it should 
not be accepted so simply. 
  On the other hand, Senpachi Oishi, a pro-reformist, said the 
currently-proposed bills are not perfect, but they must be 
enacted for the LDP to regain power. Former Deputy Prime 
Minister Masaharu Gotoda said efforts have been made to bring 
the current bills as close to the original LDP-proposed bills as 
possible, so the party should try to maintain its unity and work 
out a compromise with the coalition parties. 
  Following the debates, LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori 
said if the political reform bills were to be returned to the 
lower house for reapproval, the LDP would face the danger of 
falling apart. He asked for the understanding of party members 
on the need to agree to convene a joint committee of both 
houses, provided the coalition parties agree not to return the 
bills to the lower house for reapproval. The LDP General 
Council thus agreed to a plan to work out a compromise with the 
coalition parties. 
  On convening a joint committee of both houses, Sadatoshi 
Ozato, chairman of LDP Diet Affairs Committee, at a news 
conference this evening: 
  [Begin Ozato recording] Since a thorough and orderly 
discussion on the bills is to be conducted at a joint committee 
of both house of the Diet, I believe we can look forward to it 
in all sincerity, as I have already mentioned, and hope for its 
success. [end recording] 
  Former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Gotoda, and other 
members who seek enactment of the political reform bills during 
the current Diet session, have also urged LDP President Yohei 
Kono to try to work out a compromise that would bring the bills 
as close to the original LDP-proposed bills as possible at the 
joint committee of both houses. Kono said he would do his best.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) agreed Tuesday [25 January] to set up a 
joint committee of both houses of the Diet to discuss the fate 
of the government-proposed political reform bills that were 
rejected by the House of Councillors last week. The LDP made 
the decision at a meeting of executives, party officials said. 
  If two-thirds of the 20 joint panel members agree on a 
compromise plan, the four bills can be enacted into law once 
they are endorsed by a majority of votes at plenary sessions of 
both houses. 
  The seven-party coalition hopes that the package would be 
enacted during the current Diet session by reaching a compromise 
with the LDP at the joint committee but the prospect of reaching 
an accord before the Saturday closure of the Diet is slim, 
political sources said. 
  The coalition will be forced to take a floor vote on the 
package again at a plenary session of the lower chamber, the 
sources said. 
  The legislation, which passed through the lower house last 
November, could become a law when passed a second time by the 
lower chamber by a majority of two-thirds or more of the members 
present. However, the coalition will need about 70 defections 
from the LDP to secure a majority of two-thirds in the lower 
house and political analysts say such a case is unlikely. 
  Senior officials from the ruling coalition and the 
opposition 
of the lower house steering committee will agree later in the 
day to set up the committee and the forming of the committee 
will be formally endorsed at a lower house plenary session on 
Wednesday, Diet sources said. The committee will hold its first 
meeting after the two houses elect 10 members each, the sources 
said. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has staked his 
political career on enacting the legislation before the current 
Diet session ends Saturday, is planning to hold a press 
conference to call for popular support for enactment of the 
package, government sources said. 
  Hosokawa also hopes to hold a top meeting with LDP president 
Yohei Kono to break the deadlock, the sources said. The 
Hosokawa government displaced the LDP from power last August for 
the first time in nearly 40 years, pledging to clean up Japan's 
scandal-tainted political system. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata hinted at the possibility of 
dissolution of the lower house for a snap election should the 
government-proposed political reform bills be scrapped by the 
Diet. But Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and Health 
and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi ruled out such a possibility.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- Senior officials of the 
House of Representatives Steering Committee agreed Tuesday [25 
January] to set up a joint committee of both houses of the Diet 
to discuss the fate of the government-proposed political reform 
bills rejected by the House of Councillors last week, Diet 
sources said. The lower house will approve the establishment of 
the panel at a plenary session Wednesday afternoon, the sources 
said. 
  The lower house, which approved the bills in November, will 
select its 10 members from among those who voted for them. The 
upper chamber will send 10 members from among those who voted 
against the bills. 
  If two-thirds of the joint panel members agree on a 
compromise plan, the package can be written into law once they 
are endorsed by a majority of votes at plenary sessions of both 
houses of the Diet. 
  Earlier in the day the main opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) agreed to set up the panel after a three-hour stormy 
session of the decision-making Executive Council, party 
officials said. The LDP is divided over electoral reform bills, 
the center pillar of the package. 
  The seven-party coalition hopes that the package will be 
enacted during the current Diet session by reaching a compromise 
with the LDP at the joint committee. But the prospect of 
reaching an accord before Saturday's closure of the Diet is

leader of the Democratic Socialist Party and Social Democratic 
Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama ruled out such a possibility.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata on Tuesday [25 January] hinted at the possibility of 
dissolution of the House of Representatives for a snap election 
should the government-proposed political reform bills be 
scrapped by the Diet. At a press conference after the day's 
cabinet meeting, Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, said 
political reform is a problem for each member of the Diet, and 
the prime minister can not deal with it by himself. 
  Hata indicated parliament must shoulder the responsibility 
if 
the political reform package fails to be passed. 
  The ruling coalition parties and the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party are continuing negotiations on a compromise 
after the House of Councillors rejected the bills last Friday. 
The bills cleared the more powerful lower house in mid-November. 
  Following the upper house rejection of the bills, Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said he would keep trying to realize 
his commitment to political reform until Saturday, the last day 
of the current extraordinary Diet session. 
  Hosokawa has repeatedly pledged to take responsibility if he 
fails to enact the reform bills by the end of the Diet. 
  The pledge is interpreted as indicating his readiness to 
disband his cabinet or dissolve the lower house to seek a snap 
election on the issue of political reform should the reform 
bills be scrapped.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- An influential business 
leader cautioned Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa Monday [24 
January] against dissolving the Diet to call a snap national 
election, saying the political vacuum would hurt an already 
sluggish domestic economy. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Federation of 
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), was referring to options 
facing Hosokawa in the wake of his failure Friday to push a 
package of political reform bills through the House of 
Councillors. 
  He told a news conference that both the ruling and 
opposition 
parties should join forces to realize political reforms "with 
wide perspectives." 
  Hiraiwa said the worst choice would be to dissolve the Diet 
and call a general election because the ensuing political vacuum 
would damage the economy. 
  Prolonged political uncertainty will worsen the economic 
situation further as reflected in the steep fall in the value of 
the yen and stock prices, he said. 
  Hiraiwa called on Hosokawa to display leadership in 
promoting 
political reforms.

  [Excerpt] Speaking at a news conference today, Chairman 
Timiichi Murayama of the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] indicated that his party will not comply with any call 
for amending the part on political funds in a package of 
political reform bills. Touching on the question of whether 
Prime Minister Hosokawa will take the responsibility if the 
package of political reform bills are killed in the Diet during 
its current session, Chairman Murayama said: 
  [Begin Murayama recording] It is not desirable to leave 
Japan 
with a political vacuum at a time when Japan is mired in a 
severe recession. The prime minister should first work to 
compile a budget for fiscal 1994. He should make a decision on 
the responsibility after the enactment of the budget. I believe 
the Hosokawa cabinet should fulfill its responsibility to the 
people. [end recording] 
  In this way, Chairman Murayama said Prime Minister Hosokawa 
should not dissolve the House of Representatives and announce 
the resignation of his cabinet en masse, and the prime minister 
should make a decision on his responsibility after the budget is 
enacted in the Diet. [passage omitted on the SDPJ's discussing 
ways to handle its members who voted against the bills in the 
lower house].

  [Excerpt] Ruling and opposition parties, in the final 
stage of their battle over a package of political reform bills, 
have agreed to set up a joint committee of both houses of the 
Diet to hammer out a compromise plan. However, some members of 
the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and the ruling Social 
Democratic Party of Japan are increasingly taking the view that 
reform of the current electoral system should be deferred until 
later, and it remains unclear whether the joint committee will 
hammer out the compromise plan. With the current Diet session 
set to close soon, the tense situation is continuing. [passage

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- The compiling of the fiscal 
1994 government budget is likely to take place after the 
February 11 meeting of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, Japan's trade minister said Tuesday [25 
January]. 
  Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and 
industry, told a regular press conference after the cabinet 
meeting that it will suffice if blueprints for the scale of the 
budget for the year starting April and the proposed tax reforms 
are decided before the Washington meeting. 
  Kumagai said he hopes traditional bureaucratic procedures to 
decide the budget will be streamlined compared with how it was 
under the rule of the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  With respect to the planned additional pump-priming package, 
he said the government will make a "political decision" on the 
scale of a potential tax cut and how to fund it as soon as the 
Diet closes its current session on Saturday.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Labor Minister Chikara 
Sakaguchi asked an advisory panel Monday [24 January] to 
consider the feasibility of changing a labor law to allow women 
to work more overtime. 
  He also sought approval from the Women's and Young Workers' 
Problems Council to add to the equal job opportunity guidelines 
provisions to urge employers not to discriminate against women 
in job recruitment and in the workplace. 
  The ministry hopes to put the measures into effect in April 
following their expected endorsement by the panel, ministry 
officials said. 
  The changes could affect 14 million female office workers, 
the officials said. 
  Sakaguchi wants maximum overtime hours for women raised from 
the current 24 hours per four weeks to 36 hours. 
  The additions to the guidelines would call on companies to 
stop allocating a specific share of jobs to men and women in 
recruitment and to refrain from other practices that 
discriminate against women workers.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Japan's top two automakers, 
Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., said Friday [21 
January] their domestic motor vehicle sales and production in 
1993 dropped from the previous year for the third consecutive 
year. 
  The lackluster performance is attributable largely to the 
national economic slump, the two automakers said. 
  Toyota, leader of the industry, said its exports of 
passenger 
cars, trucks and buses declined 9.4 percent from the year before 
to 1,539,005 units. 
  Domestic sales also dipped 7.4 percent to 2,065,687, the 
company said. 
  Toyota said its domestic production slumped 9.4 percent to 
3,561,750 but overseas output surged 16.2 percent to 888,559. 
  "Although exports to Asia and Oceania fared well, total 
exports were down because of a decrease in exports to North 
America, Europe and the Middle East," a company statement said. 
  In December, the company said exports were down 14.3 percent 
at 113,114 while domestic sales slipped 15.1 percent to 135,636. 
  Nissan said its exports of passenger cars and commercial 
vehicles in 1993 plummeted 27.4 percent from the preceding year 
to 684,088 while domestic sales were down 8.4 percent at 
1,098,502. 
  It was the second straight year that the company's exports 
had declined from the year before, the company said. 
  Production overseas climbed 16.5 percent to 1,006,204 but 
domestic output plunged 14.5 percent to 1,811,591, the third 
consecutive year-to-year fall, the second-largest automaker said. 
  "The sluggish economy worldwide and appreciation of the yen 
against foreign currencies badly affected Nissan's exports," the 
company said. 
  In December, the company said exports nose-dived 47.9 
percent 
to 44,463 while domestic sales dropped 12.9 percent to 72,865. 
  Domestic production dropped 23.9 percent to 117,494 while 
overseas output fell 11.8 percent to 66,543, it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 24 KYODO -- Japan's total production 
of cars, trucks and buses in 1993 showed the sharpest fall since 
1974 and was down for the third straight year, reflecting 
sluggish demand both at home and overseas, an industry 
association reported Monday [24 January]. 
  It was the first time production had fallen for three 
straight years since the end of World War II. 
  The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said output 
totaled 11,227,545 vehicles, down 10.2 percent from the previous 
year, the second steepest fall in the postwar period following 
the 24.1 percent decline posted in 1947. 
  Production of passenger cars fell for the third straight 
year, dropping 9.4 percent to 8,497,094. 
  Production of trucks plunged 12.6 percent to 2,682,377, the 
fifth straight yearly drop, and that of buses fell 7.6 percent 
to 48,074. 
  Domestic sales of cars, trucks and buses fell 7.1 percent 
from the year before to 6,467,278 vehicles, reflecting flagging 
personal consumption due to the economic slump. 
  It said 4,199,450 passenger cars were sold, down 5.7 percent 
from the year before and the third straight year-on-year decline. 
  Sales of trucks dipped 9.4 percent to 2,248,803, the fifth 
straight yearly fall, and sales of buses plummeted 11.8 percent 
to 19,025. 
  Exports fell for the eighth straight year, plunging about 
11.0 percent from the year before to an estimated 5.02 million. 
  In December, production of cars, trucks and buses vehicles 
totaled 789,180, down 18.3 percent from the year before and the 
sharpest fall since June 1974, when production fell 19.3 percent. 
  It was the 15th straight month in which production had 
fallen 
from the year-before levels, the association said. 
  The figure was lowest for the month since December 1978, 
when 
production totaled 753,377 vehicles. 
  It said 467,457 passenger cars were produced, down 17.3 
percent from the year before and the ninth straight year-on-year 
decline. 
  Production of trucks fell 21.4 percent to 182,760, extending 
the yearly fall to the 29th month, while that of buses was down 
28.9 percent at 2,780. 
  The association said domestic sales of cars, trucks and 
buses 
in December were down 8.4 percent at 467,457 vehicles, with 
312,558 cars being sold, down 5.7 percent. 
  Sales of trucks slumped 13.3 percent to 153,989, the 15th 
straight year-on-year fall, and those of buses were down 12.3 
percent at 910. 
  Japan produced 3,023,154 motorcycles in 1993, down 5.4 
percent from the year before, the first yearly drop in four 
years. 
  Exports posted the fourth straight year-on-year rise, 
climbing about 3.0 percent to an estimated 1.72 million. 
  Production in December plunged 16.1 percent to 221,652, the 
ninth straight yearly fall. 
  Domestic sales of motorcycles in December totaled 89,140, 
down 2.3 percent, and exports fell for the fourth straight 
yearly fall, dropping about 12.0 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- The Central Union of 
Agricultural Cooperatives (Zenchu) on Wednesday [19 January] 
approved the resignation of its President Yoshiharu Sato, union 
officials said. 
  The officials of the governing body of farming cooperatives 
nationwide said Sato's successor will be chosen at its general 
meeting on March 4. But sources close to the organization said 
selection of the new president may hit a snag, as the group is 
split over the government's decision on a partial opening of the 
nation's rice market under the Uruguay Round of global trade 
talks sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  The organization will hold a meeting on February 16 to 
select 
candidates for the presidency, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- The Central Union of 
Agricultural Cooperatives (Zenchu) said Wednesday [19 January] 
it will study the possibility of forming a political party to 
restructure the agricultural movement. The organization said 
the study will be made under a new action program to be adopted 
at a national congress scheduled for the fall. 
  Zenchu is concerned that the views of farmers may be 
neglected in the process of political reforms, and it has become 
more important than ever to strengthen the unity of farmers and 
restructure the agricultural movement effectively, Zenchu 
officials said. 
  The officials said the union was upset by the failure to 
prevent the opening of the rice market under the Uruguay Round 
of trade talks organized by the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. They said the union will seek to have the government 
review a new agricultural policy, including reorganization of 
the agricultural industry. 
  The officials said the organization will try to prevent the 
ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement by the Diet. 
  The Hitachi-Mitsubishi alliance is the first among Japanese 
concerns on development of flash memory chips, although some 
Japanese firms have teamed up with foreign companies on flash 
memory chips. 
  Hitachi and Mitsubishi did not disclose how much money they 
would spend on developing flash memory chips, but industry 
sources said the two companies are likely to spend at least 50 
to 60 billion yen for a 64-megabit chip alone.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 19 KYODO -- Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi 
Electric Corp. said Wednesday [19 January] they have agreed to 
join forces to develop flash memory chips, tipped as one of the 
boom semiconductor products of the 1990s. The two Japanese 
electronics concerns said they will jointly develop a 16-megabit 
flash memory chip based on Mitsubishi's own technology and a 
64-megabit flash memory chip based on Hitachi's own technology. 
  Hitachi and Mitsubishi said SGS-Thomson Microelectronics, 
the 
Franco-Italian concern and Europe's second-largest chip 
producer, is considering joining the Hitachi-Mitsubishi alliance. 
  Mitsubishi now has a business alliance with SGS-Thomson for 
development of flash memory chips. 
  Unlike many other memory chips, flash memory chips can 
retain 
data even when power is shut off and can be erased and 
reprogrammed in a "flash" with electric charges. 
  Flash memory chips are seen as the key to realizing a new 
generation of portable products ranging from small computers to 
digital cameras and faxes. 
  Hitachi and Mitsubishi said their agreement also calls for 
consolidating their flash memory product lines with a view to 
taking the lead in setting industry standards as required by 
users. 
  Company officials said the deal is aimed at sharing the 
risks 
and costs involved in the development of a new chip. "The scale 
of investment needed to match the growth of the semiconductor 
business and the rapid pace of innovation has become too large 
for any one company to bear in view of the risks and costs 
involved," said Shoji Hirabayashi, managing director at 
Mitsubishi Electric. 
  "This partnership between Hitachi and Mitsubishi in the 
field 
of flash memories involves a sharing of resources in the areas 
of research and development as well as production, and as such 
is an undertaking of great significance to the future progress 
and development of each company," said Tsugio Makimoto, 
executive managing director at Hitachi. 
  The semiconductor industry so far has provided the market 
with flash memory chips that use two types of cell structure -- 
nor and nand. Nor-based chips are now the market mainstream and 
used both by Hitachi and Mitsubishi for their products. 
  The latest agreement covers new types of flash memory 
technologies -- dinor-type chips developed by Mitsubishi and 
nand-type ones developed by Hitachi. 
  The dinor flash memory chip is an advanced version of the 
existing nor-type chip, providing higher integration and single 
power-source operation at lower voltage as week as shorter 
access time. [as received] 
  The and flash memory chip has a new cell structure that 
incorporates the features of nand and dor structures, providing 
higher integration and single power-source operation at lower 
voltage as well as small block erasability in units of 512 bytes. 
  Hitachi and Mitsubishi said the dinor and nand chips are 
expected to become the mainstream technologies for flash memory 
chips of 16-megabit and largest capacity.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 20 KYODO -- Matsushita Research 
Institute Tokyo, Inc. announced Thursday [20 January] it has 
developed a powerful, one-centimeter-long micro-motor for use in 
miniature machines. 
  The device is 1.4 millimeters in diameter and has a pivot 
that rotates 100 to 160 times a minute, said officials at the 
institute, a subsidiary of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., 
one of the world's largest electronics manufacturers. 
  To make the motor, researchers covered a ceramic pivot one 
millimeter in diameter with resin, fixed 16 electrodes to the 
resin and enveloped them in a cylinder. Then they dissolved the 
resin to let the pivot rotate within the cylinder. 
  They aim to upgrade the motor several years from now to 
produce as much power as the one currently used for pagers, 
which is 1.2 centimeters long and six millimeters in diameter, 
said Takeo Sato of the institute based in Kawasaki, Kanagawa 
Prefecture. 
  The motor could be applicable to micro-technology for use in 
human blood vessels to check or treat diseases, he said.

at present, running 165 kilometers at a per-hour speed of a 
steady 40 kilometers on a single battery charge. 
  The model will be available at 60 Mitsubishi dealer shops 
across Japan except for districts with very cold weather and 
snow such as Hokkaido and the Tohoku region, they said. 
  The price is ranging from 11,230,000 yen to 11,248,000 yen. 
The companies aim at annual sales of 50 vehicles, the officials 
added.

  [Text] According to reports from the UN Headquarters, a 
Chinese representative spoke on 21 January at the second session 
of the preparatory committee for the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] signatories' meeting to be held in 1995. In his 
address, he denounced some nuclear powers for lacking sincerity 
toward peace. 
  He said that the NPT itself is not the ultimate aim of 
mankind and insisted that mankind's ultimate aim is complete 
prohibition [kumji] and abolition [pagoe] of nuclear weapons. 
He stressed that the nuclear states' refusals to agree to 
prohibit and abolish nuclear weapons is effecting the permanence 
of the imbalance in rights and duties that are stipulated in the 
treaty for nuclear and nonnuclear states and that as a result, 
it has become impossible to completely guarantee the security 
demanded by many nonnuclear states. 
  He asked: If nuclear states -- particularly, nuclear powers 
that have worldwide nuclear attack ability -- only emphasize 
nuclear nonproliferation and absolute safety for themselves and 
ignore nonnuclear states' justified concerns, how on earth can 
nonnuclear states be expected to trust the nuclear powers' 
sincerity toward peace? 
  He appealed to all nuclear states not to use nuclear weapons 
first and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against 
nonnuclear states and nuclear-free zones.

for striking the strategic interior of the northern half of 
Korea, according to military sources. 
  Meanwhile, the South Korean puppets let formations of 
helicopters, each composed of three or four, make low and 
ultra-low flights above Yonchon, Paju and Chorwon on the same 
days in an exercise for supporting an attack operation of ground 
units to break through the Military Demarcation Line. 
  Tensions persist on the Korean peninsula due to the war 
moves 
of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 23 (KCNA) -- The U.S. 
imperialists on January 20 and 21 staged a round-the-clock 
combined air war exercise aimed at a preemptive strike at the 
northern half of Korea by letting fly formations of 
overseas-based pursuit assault planes and VTOL assault planes, 
an "E-3" early warning plane, a "KC-135" tanker and warplanes 
belonging to the U.S. seventh airforce in South Korea, according 
to military sources. 
  Synchronizing with the exercise, they carried out aerial 
photographing and electronic reconnaissance on the North on 
January 21 with an "RC-135" strategic reconnaissance plane in 
the sky above the area adjacent to the Military Demarcation Line. 
  On the 20th and 21st, electronic reconnaissance on the 
strategic depths of the North was carried out by "U-2" 
high-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes and "RV-1" 
tactical reconnaissance planes and on the 20th an aerial 
reconnaissance on the North's frontline and coastline areas was 
conducted by eight reconnaissance planes of various types 
including "E-3" and "RC-12". 
  Such acts of war provocation are a grave challenge to the 
detente and peace on the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> ["They Should Be Held Responsible for the Consequences of </F>
War Gamble" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique blared that it would stage a large-scale joint war 
exercise in August together with the United States by 
integrating "Ulchi" and "Focus Lens" war exercises in case the 
"Team Spirit" joint manoeuvres were suspended this year. 
Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands this as a 
challenge to the desire of the fellow countrymen for detente and 
peace and a deliberate move to lay one more stumbling-block in 
the way of the DPRK-USA talks. 
  The analyst says: 
  The suspension of the "Team Spirit" joint manoeuvres is 
aimed 
at removing nuclear threat, not at changing the codename. 
  If a joint nuclear military drill larger than the "Team 
Spirit" is staged, the suspension of the "Team Spirit" is 
meaningless. 
  The puppets' scheme to stage nuclear war exercises against 
the North together with foreign forces under changed codename is 
a mockery of the world opinion. 
  Not only the "Team Spirit" but all other nuclear war 
exercises against the North must be discontinued in South Korea. 
Otherwise, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can not be 
solved any time nor can detente and peace be achieved. 
  The North is prepared for both dialogue and war. 
  The South Korean puppets will be held wholly responsible for 
the irrevocable consequences arising from their wildcat war 
exercises and aggravation of tensions.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Puppets Are Accelerating Chemical </F>
War Preparations"] 
  [Text] Today our people and peaceloving people of the 
world are strongly demanding complete abolition of chemical 
weapons, in addition to nuclear weapons -- mass lethal weapons. 
  Chemical weapons, which kill and injure people by using 
poisonous chemical materials, are branded as the most cruel 
massacre weapons in the world and thus their use and development 
have been prohibited by international commitments. 
  Only traitor Kim Yong-sam, who hangs out the signboard of 
civilian politics, is openly pursuing possession of chemical 
weapons. 
  This shows that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is going to 
openly perpetrate not only nuclear war, but also chemical war, 
against fellow countrymen. We cannot but regard it as very 
grave. As has already been known, successive ruling bunches have 
produced and stockpiled chemical weapons from long ago. There 
are more than 40 underground nuclear warehouses and underground 
chemical weapon warehouses in areas around Mt. Kyeryong in South 
Chungchong Province and in the area near Suwon, Kyonggi 
Province. Many ion chemical weapons, known as malicious mass 
lethal weapons, are stockpiled there. 
  While talking about possession of independent chemical 
warfare capability, former South Korean dictators built more 
than 10 poisonous gas plants in South Korea and produced a great 
number of chemical weapons. 
  The rascals brought from the United States on a large scale 
military aircraft capable of dropping chemical bombs and 155-mm 
[word indistinct] guns capable of firing the bombs. They also 
purchased gas masks on a pretext of preparing for chemical 
warfare. 
  A chemical, biological, and radiological unit school has 
been 
operating in the puppet Army for a long time to train 
professional chemical warfare experts. 
  By loudly raving that chemical warfare has become a 
worldwide 
trend, the former puppet warmongers exhibited various chemical 
equipment they produced and even propagandized its superiority. 
  The Team Spirit joint military exercise, conducted every 
year 
in South Korea, has become an important leverage to achieve not 
only the nuclear war plan, but also the rascals' chemical war 
plan. New chemical war equipment was mobilized in the recent 
Team Spirit joint military exercise and units specializing in 
chemical war training participated in the exercise. 
  Reporting on the true aspect of chemical war exercises 
conducted during the Team Spirit joint military exercise several 
years ago, a South Korean broadcast said that in addition to 
aircraft attacks on simulated areas in the North side, smoke 
bombs, chemical shells, bacterial shells, and even explosive 
shells, were dropped during the exercise. As the result, all 
living things can barely survive. 
  Just as former dictators, puppet Kim Yong-sam, who claims to 
be a civilian politician in South Korea, is also scheming to 
inflict, not only nuclear disaster, but also poisonous gas 
calamity on fellow countrymen by clinging to the sleeves of 
outside forces. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, in a so-called conference of 
offices and agencies concerned, decided to possess chemical 
weapons and to submit the bill to National Assembly for 
ratification. 
  This clearly shows how frantically the rascals are running 
amok with chemical war preparations. 
  Going against the trend of the time toward disarmament and 
detente, the civilian warmongers are accelerating production of 
chemical weapons -- mass lethal weapons the use of which is 
prohibited worldwide -- and are attempting to inflict the 
disaster of chemical weapons on fellow countrymen. Their crime 
will not be pardoned forever. 
  The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam should give up criminal 
chemical war preparations and should act with discretion. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, in spite of the warnings 
of our people and the people of the world, is advancing along 
the road of continuously committing antinational maneuvers to 
accelerate preparation of nuclear war and chemical war on the 
Korean peninsula in collusion with outside forces, the rascals 
cannot avoid the responsibility for all consequences arising 
therefrom nor can they evade the stern judgment of history.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
in an article titled "Whither Are They Leading North-South 
Relations?" Accuses the South Korean puppets of pursuing 
North-South confrontation and war against fellow countrymen in 
conspiracy with outside forces, not national unity and 
reconciliation, from the beginning of the year. 
  The author of the article says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique makes provocative remarks 
from 
the beginning of the year over the fiction of "nuclear issue of 
the North" and declares that in case the Team Spirit joint 
military maneuvers were suspended this year, it would hold 
large-scale war exercises combining Ulchi and Focus Lens. 
  Judging from their words and deeds, there is no doubt that 
they will pursue North-South confrontation and resort to 
military adventures against the North this year, too. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam opened the rice market of South 
Korea in order to curry favour with his U.S. master and hurt 
fellow countrymen. Thus, he fully revealed his treacherous 
color as a colonial stooge. 
  The South Korean people have risen up in a struggle to oust 
despicable Kim Yong-sam, saying there is nothing to expect from 
the puppet who kowtows to his imperialist master, sells off the 
country and the nation and tramples down the people's desire for 
independence, democracy and reunification. 
  It is evident that the wretched puppet clique forsaken by 
the 
people will persistently pursue North-South confrontation and 
may resort to military adventures, tailing behind outside 
forces, in an attempt to get rid of the crisis. 
  The South Korean people will never pardon the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique seeking war against the nation's desire for 
peaceful reunification.

President Kim Il-song Wednesday [19 January] sent a message of 
condolence to the bereaved family of the late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, 
a pro-reunification patriot of South Korea, on his death from a 
sudden illness. 
  President Kim Il-song in the message said the death of the 
reputed pro-reunification patriot who devotedly struggled for 
the independence and democratisation of South Korean society and 
for a peaceful reunification of the country was a big loss to 
our nation. 
  Though he passed away to our sorrow, not seeing the day of 
national reunification which he aspired after in his lifetime, 
the feats performed by him on the patriotic road of 
reunification will always remain in the hearts of the 
compatriots at home and abroad, said President Kim Il-song.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- Paek In-chun, 
chairman of the North side headquarters of the National Alliance 
for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon), sent a telephone 
message today to the funeral committee of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan. 
  The message says: 
  We are inexpressively sad to hear the news that Rev. Mun 
Ik-hwan suddenly passed away. 
  Expressing deep condolences over his death, the North side 
headquarters of Pomminnyon has decided to send a mourners' group 
to join personages of various strata in the South in paying 
homage to the deceased and consoling the bereaved family so that 
we can share painful sorrow with the Southern brothers and 
sisters. 
  We inform you that a five-member group led by the chairman 
of

Panmunjom at 8 AM January 22 [2300 GMT 21 January] (Saturday) to 
attend the funeral of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan and leave Seoul for home 
in the afternoon. 
  We have already asked the minister of the "Unification 
Board" 
of your side to hold a working contact to discuss the passage 
through Panmunjom of our mourners' group and the provision of 
convenience and personal safety during its stay. We hope for 
your cooperation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- The mourners' group 
of the North side formed to express condolences over the death 
of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a South Korean reputed patriotic champion 
of reunification, today released a statement denouncing the 
South Korean authorities for blocking a working-level contact at 
Panmunjom and not allowing the group to go to Seoul. 
  Their act is an insult to the deceased who devotedly 
struggled for national reunification, the cherished desire of 
the nation, and a violation of the beautiful manners and 
customs, etiquette and morality handed down through generations, 
the statement said, and continued: 
  Not allowing no more than five people to go to Seoul to 
mourn 
the death of Rev. Mun, the South Korean authorities clearly 
showed once again that the "civilian" regime and the "civilian 
administration" on their lips are a downright lie. 
  By preventing their call of condolence over the death of a 
fellow countryman, the Kim Yong-sam group has left an indelible 
stain in the history of the nation as the most despicable 
traitor of the successive South Korean rulers. 
  The Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique charged the North side 
with the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification 
(Pomminnyon) and the "nuclear issue." [sentence as received] It 
is a poor excuse for preventing a call of condolence from the 
North side. 
  Its slander on Pomminnyon, a national umbrella organization 
of the reunification movement, indicates that the Kim Yong-sam 
regime is a group of anti-reunification elements and that to 
charge the North over the fictitious "nuclear issue" proves that 
they themselves are traitors subservient to foreign forces. 
  The behavior of blocking under an absurd pretext the call of 
condolence prompted by compatriotic feelings and etiquette 
showed that the Kim Yong-sam regime is in a very difficult 
position in which it cannot receive even five mourners and has 
but a few days left before it. 
  The people in the North, together with the fellow countrymen 
in the South, will certainly settle accounts with the South 
Korean rulers. 
  People of all walks of life in South Korea are now lifting 
up 
louder voices criticizing the Kim Yong-sam regime for blocking 
the Seoul visit of our mourners' group. This is a serious 
warning to the hooligans who know neither etiquette nor morality. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group hell bent on maintaining its power 
while desperately pursuing the policy of depending on outside 
forces, opposed to the national reconciliation and unity and the 
reunification of the country, the cherished desire of the entire 
fellow countrymen, will have to pay a high price before the 
nation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- The Committee for 
the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] published a 
statement today, which says: 
  "The South Korean authorities barred our mourners' group 
from 
going to Seoul to mourn the death of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan at his 
bier. This stripped them bare, revealing their color as 
hooligans ignorant of the beautiful customs and manners and 
civility and morality handed down from the ancestors and a group 
of traitors who are clean indifferent to peace of the country 
and its reunification. We denounce this with national 
resentment. 
  "The South Korean authorities branded the National Alliance 
for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon) as `an organisation 
benefiting the enemy' in order to block the attendance of the 
North side's mourners' group at the funeral of Rev. Mun. This 
once again disclosed to the whole world that they are an 
anti-national, anti-reunification group which treats all the 
fellow countrymen who aspire after reunification as `enemies'. 
  "Worse still, they took issue with our offer of mourning 
visit by linking it with the fictitious `nuclear issue.' This is 
a political provocation motivated by a sinister purpose to 
further aggravate the North-South relations by connecting the 
humanitarian question with the political and military question 
in a far-fetched manner." 
  The statement stresses: 
  "We will curse through years the treacherous crime of the 
South Korean rulers in blocking the mourning visit of our side 
in violation of the elementary human ethic and morality and 
settle account with them for this. The Kim Yong-sam group which 
is prolonging its days by dependence on outside forces, 
treacheries, political swindle and irregulaties will meet its 
doom before long. 
  "The South Korean rulers should act discreetly with reason."

<F P=106> ["Nation's Common Programme of Reunification" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
in a signed article says that the three principles of 
independence, peaceful reunification and great unity of the 
nation is the common programme of the nation for reunification. 
  The article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as 
saying: 
  "The principles and line adhered to by our party and the 
government of our Republic for national reunification remain 
unchanged. We will continue to make every effort to reunify the 
country in the form of a confederation based on one nation, one 
state, two systems and two governments, and on the three 
principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great 
national unity." 
  The article goes on: 
  As the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said, the principles 
of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity 
are the three principles consistently maintained by the Workers' 
Party of Korea in the struggle for national reunification. 
Because these principles clearly show the way of solving the 
national reunification question in conformity with the will and 
interests of the entire Korean people. 
  The reunification of the country is a cause of putting an 
end 
to the domination and interference of outside forces and 
realizing national independence on a nationwide scale. 
  The reunification of the country, the cause of independence 
of the nation, can successfuly be solved only by the efforts of 
the Korean nation itself. The driving force of the 
reunification of the country is the Korean nation. 
  Korea must be reunified by peaceful means. The Korean nation 
must be reunified into one. But a war must not be chosen for 
this purpose. It is the biggest tragedy and shame for fellow 
countrymen to live in antagonism or to fight each other with 
arms. 
  The whole nation must share the same will and firmly unite 
as 
one in the struggle for national reunification. A bright 
prospect of national reunification can be opened when the entire 
people in the North and the South achieve great national unity 
on the principle of giving priority to the common interests of 
the nation, transcending the differences in idea, system and 
religious belief, and of subordinating everything to the cause 
of national reunification. 
  Great national unity is the fundamental prerequisite to 
independent and peaceful reunification and its essential 
content. Independent and peaceful reunification is unthinkable 
apart from great national unity. 
  The harmony and unity of the entire nation is the very 
reunification of the country that we desire. 
  The three principles of independence, peaceful reunification 
and great national unity are a common action program which the 
North and the South agreed upon and proclaimed to the world 
jointly, the article stresses.

  [Text] Beijing, Jan. 25, IRNA -- A senior Iranian Foreign 
Ministry official, who is currently in Pyongyang, Monday voiced 
Iran's support for the unification of the two Koreas. 
  Manuchehr Mottaki, who is deputy foreign minister for legal 
and consulate affairs, made the remark while discussing 
Tehran-Pyongyang relations with North Korean Foreign Minister 
Kim Yong-nam. 
  Mottaki referred to the chaotic unstable situation in 
countries neighboring Iran and said Tehran makes efforts for 
preserving peace and security in Central Asia, Afghanistan and 
the Persian Gulf. 
  Referring to the 1988 visit to North Korea of the leader of 
the Islamic revolution Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, who was then in 
the capacity of Iran's president, Kim reiterated that the spirit 
of the joint communique issued then by the two countries still 
was prevailing over bilateral relations. He stressed that 
current world developments would not affect bilateral relations 
between the two countries.

  [Text] According to a report, Sakuma, an adviser to the 
Japanese Defense Agency, made bellicose remarks that in the case 
of an emergency on the Korean peninsula, Japan cannot help but 
do something for South Korea, and that it must look into coming 
up with plans on how to cooperate with the U.S. Forces. His 
grave remarks greatly agitate us and are an open challenge to us 
that cannot be forgiven. These remarks clearly show the 
Japanese reactionaries' criminal attempt to invade our country 
again. 
  The Japanese right-wing reactionaries have defined us as 
their first imaginary [kasangjok] enemy by babbling about our 
non- existent nuclear issue and missile threat. Also, they have 
made bellicose and absurd remarks by talking about a so-called 
preemptive attack and saying that Japan would participate in a 
war on the Korean peninsula. 
  Warmonger Sakuma, who even served as chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff of the Japanese Self-Defense Armed Forces, made 
the bellicose and violent remarks once again under these 
circumstances. This clearly shows the seriousness of the 
Japanese reactionaries' move to seek an opportunity to invade 
Korea again. 
  The Japanese reactionaries' such move is of concern to us 
because Japan wants to act as a shock brigade backed by the 
United States. This was proven by the fact that Sakuma loudly 
babbled about cooperating with U.S. forces or providing it with 
Japanese aid. 
  While DPRK-U.S. contacts have opened the prospect for 
basically resolving the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, 
Japan has been looking for an opportunity to attack us with the 
backing of our partner in dialogue. Where else on earth can we 
find such indiscriminate remarks and acts? 
  However, the Japanese reactionaries are miscalculating. They 
must fully remember that their indiscriminate maneuvers will 
bring them miserable results. Therefore, they must not act 
recklessly.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- An advisor to the 
Japanese Defence Agency, Sakuma, in a recent lecture reportedly 
let loose a bellicose blast, saying that "Japan cannot sit idle 
in an event of contingency" on the Korean peninsula and "mode of 
Japan's cooperation with the U.S. Forces must be examined." 
  These grave utterances of Sakuma getting on the nerve of the 
DPRK are an unpardonable, undisguised challenge to it. He fully 
revealed the criminal scheme of the Japanese reactionaries to 
stage a comeback to Korea. 
  Maximizing the fiction of "nuclear issue" and "missile 
threat" of the DPRK, the Japanese rightwing reactionaries have 
of late let out a string of bellicose outbursts, threatening a 
"preemptive attack" and "Japan's participation in a war on the 
Korean peninsula", having designated the DPRK as "imaginary 
enemy No.1". 
  What is grave in this reinvasion scheme of the Japanese 
reactionaries is that they intend to make Japan a shock force 
with the backing of the United States in "an event of 
contingency" on the Korean peninsula. This is evidenced by 
Sakuma's words about "cooperation with the U.S. Forces" and 
"Japan's support to the U.S. Forces." 
  When a prospect has been opened for a fundamental solution 
of 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through DPRK-U.S. 
contact, Japan is threatening an attack on the DPRK with the 
backing of its dialogue partner. Can there be such folly in 
other parts of the world? 
  The Japanese reactionaries are making a mistake. 
  They must not act rashly, deeply mindful of the terrible 
consequences to be entailed by their rash act.

<F P=106> ["Japanese Reactionaries' Scheme of Overseas Aggression Must </F>
Be Checked: NODONG SINMUN"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
reactionaries are engaged in aggressive and belligerent moves in 
order to impose another immeasurable disaster upon mankind. 
They must not forget the lessons of history. NODONG SINMUN 
today says this in an article titled "Militarist Monster 
Bringing Disaster." 
  Pointing out that the Japanese militarists are making 
desperate efforts to make up for the defeat that they suffered 
in the past, the author of the article says: 
  Japan has potentials of the munitions industry that defy 
comparison with what it had when invading the continent. 
  A robber gets a deadly weapon for murder. Likewise, the 
Japanese reactionaries, carried away by revengeful thought and 
wild ambition for overseas expansion, are whetting the sword for 
aggression and war. 
  The "U.N. peacekeeping operation bill" railroaded through 
the 
Diet gave the first green light to Japan's troops dispatch 
overseas, after the war. In other words, the "Self-Defence 
Forces [SDF]", which has turned from a tadpole to a frog, has 
become able to jump out of the boundary of the country and 
freely strut about in the outside world. 
  The Japanese reactionaries argue that the "SDF's" operation 
within the "U.N. commanding sphere" conforms to the constitution 
and so the involvement in the U.N. peacekeeping operation must 
be a basic task of the "SDF". This betrays their intention to 
embark upon full-scale overseas aggression under the name of the 
United Nations. 
  Japan committed aggression and war under the pretext of 
"peace of the East" and "protection of Japanese residents 
overseas" in the past and now it seeks to repeat it under the 
pretext of "international contribution" and "rescue of Japanese 
overseas". 
  These days the Japanese reactionaries let loose outpourings 
about "the dispatch of the Self-Defence Forces to the Korean 
peninsula" and about Japan's "entry into a Korean war". This is 
illustrative of the realistic danger and gravity of their 
overseas aggression. 
  What draws attention in Japan's scheme of overseas 
aggression 
is that Japan is now covetous of the whole world, though its 
ambition was confined to Asia in the past. This is why Japan is 
scheming to send its Armed Forces to different parts of the 
world including Asia and Africa for military actions. For this 
very purpose Japan is trying its hardest to get a permanent seat 
of the United Nations Security Council. 
  Today Japan's nuclear armament has reached the practical 
stage. If Japan which imposed immeasurable damages on mankind 
arms itself even with nuclear weapons, the consequences will be 
unpredictable. 
  Misfortunes must be checked in advance.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Slams Japan's Scheme To Malrevise </F>
Constitution for Overseas Aggression"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- The discussion in 
the Japanese ruling quarters about the revision of the 
constitution in favor of the armed action overseas by Japanese 
troops is a dangerous move to clear the way for military 
intervention and war of aggression against other countries, 
charges NODONG SINMUN today. 
  Noting that Japan has stepped up its conversion into a 
military power and its nuclear armament and opened a road of 
troop dispatch overseas for aggression and war, the paper brands 
this as a violation of the constitution. 
  The author of the article says: 
  The current constitution of Japan declares that Japan shall 
renounce threat with and use of arms and shall not possess war 
potentials of the ground, naval and air forces. The successive 
governments of Japan, in violation of the constitution, 
organised ground, naval and air forces, the fire-power of which 
is now scores of times that of the "imperial army" before World 
War II, and have stepped up arms buildup and war preparations, 
increasing military spendings extensively. 
  Opening a road for Japanese troop dispatch overseas means 
that the Japanese ruling quarters took the first step toward 
overseas aggression. 
  The Japanese ruling quarters have so far put up the 
constitution in order to use it in making Japan appear a 
"peaceful state" abroad and giving the Japanese people a 
psychological assurance that Japan would not pursue war. 
  Calling for constitutional revision as an immediate task, 
they argue that the constitution should allow the use of arms 
overseas by the "self-defence forces" because if Japan does not 
participate in military operations of the United Nations, it may 
invite world criticism. They also argue that constitutional 
revision is necessary for Japan to become a permanent member of 
the UN Security Council. As seen above, the main purpose of 
their frenzied move to malrevise the constitution is to remove 
all elements obstructive to war, win freedom of military action 
and create conditions for their military intervention and war of 
aggression in any part of the world. 
  Malrevision of the constitution will only bring disaster to 
the Japanese people. To check Japan's conversion into a 
military power and overseas aggression is an important task for 
peace in Asia and the world.

<F P=106> ["Disinformation of Reality"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- Some paid media of 
Japan including the YOMIURI SHIMBUN recently released false 
reports that the DPRK is developing the Najin-Sonbong Free 
Economic and Trade Zone in order to overcome "economic 
difficulty" and "food shortage." This is a despicable 
anti-DPRK smear campaign, which grossly distorts the might of 
the socialist economy of the DPRK making a long drive, 
unaffected by the international economic fluctuation, and the 
reality of Korean society where all people live a worthwhile and 
happy life. 
  As far as the development of the Najin-Sonbong Free Economic 
and Trade Zone is concerned, it is a project promoted under the 
external economic policy of the DPRK. The DPRK Government has 
consistently maintained the line of building an independent 
national economy by enlisting internal potential and resources 
to the maximum under the banner of self-reliance, while 
establishing economic relations with other countries and 
developing foreign trade on the principles of complete equality 
and mutual benefit. 
  The project is promoted also in close relation with the 
Tumen 
River Area international cooperation and development sponsored 
by the United Nations Development Programme. This shows an 
aspect of the external economic development of the DPRK. 
  The Japanese reactionaries, however, describe it as "an 
open-door policy to overcome economic difficulty." This is a 
vicious slander against the DPRK. 
  Their anti-DPRK smear campaign is a graphic expression of 
their perplexity in face of the invincible vitality of the 
socialist system of the DPRK that satisfies the needs of the 
people for food, clothing and housing. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must drop the false propaganda 
against the DPRK, mindful that if they continuously resort to 
the anti-DPRK smear campaign, they will get nothing good.

<F P=106> ["Mockery of Human Conscience"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 23 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
Government is trying to avoid a probe into the truth of the 
criminal case concerning "comfort women for the Army" and shirk 
the obligation to compensate for it, claiming that it could not 
decide how to deal with the issue mainly because it was 
difficult to confirm that those who declared themselves former 
"comfort women" were true ones or not. 
  This shows that the Japanese authorities have no elementary 
conscience and morality and that they are trying to evade the 
blame for the crime, stresses NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The issue of "comfort women for the Army" is a criminal case 
against humanity, in which the Japanese imperialists in the 
past drafted more than 200,000 Asian and European women, mostly 
Koreans, as sex slaves for the Japanese Army by invoking state 
power and vpolated and killed them. 
  The Japanese Government, far from apologizing and 
compensating for the shocking crime of human rights violations 
without precedent in history, denies the issue itself. Unable 
to repress resentment at its shameless behavior, many former 
"comfort women" testified to the criminal case. 
  The Japanese authorities, however, doubt if they are really 
former "comfort women" far from feeling remorse of conscience at 
the heartrending testimonies of those who made a narrow escape 
from death. 
  Anyone, if he is not an insensible person, will not ourn a 
deaf ear to the touching appeal of the surviving "comfort women". 
  The Japanese authorities, the offender, do not admit the 
crimes at which the world is resentful, because they do not 
honestly reflect on the seriousness of the crime and do not want 
to part with the crime-woven past. 
  If Japan thinks it can gloss over the past crimes without 
atonement, it is a mistake. 
  The Japanese authorities must frankly admit the pash crimes, 
clarify the truth and sincerely apologize and compensate for 
them.

  [Text] Tokyo, January 21 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Chairman of the 
Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful Reunification, Kim 
Chong-su, said in a press statement January 20 that the plot of 
new large-scale war exercises against the North framed by the 
Kim Yong- sam puppet regime and the puppet Army brasshats from 
the beginning of the new year revealed the intention of the 
South Korean authorities to continue along the road of 
confrontation and war contrary to the nation's desire this year, 
too, not seeking national reconciliation and unity. 
  Recalling the declaration of the South Korean authorities 
that they would stage massive joint military exercises under a 
changed codename, instead of the "Team Spirit," he said: "This 
is aimed at putting a spoke in the wheel of the DPRK-U.S. talks 
and laying a new high hurdle in the solution of the nuclear 
issue. If they stage the war game, the suspension of the `Team 
Spirit' nuclear war exercises will practically be meaningless 
and a more dangerous situation will be created in Korea." 
  "The South Korean authorities must clearly know that if they 
continue to pursue confrontation and war, turning their back on 
the compatriots desirous of reconciliation and unity, detente 
and peace, they will face a stern judgment by the nation, sooner 
or later," he warned.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- The great leader 
President Kim Il-song received a letter from UN Secretary 
General Butrus Butrus Ghali who visited the DPRK in December 
last year. 
  The secretary general said in his letter: The meeting with 
you, and the luncheon that you hosted afterwards were the 
highlight of my stay in Pyongyang. It was useful to review 
matters of mutual concern, including your proposals for the 
reunification of Korea and, more generally, the need for peace, 
security and development on the Korean peninsula. I fully share 
your view that the armistice agreement, which is nearly forty 
years old, must be replaced by a permanent peace treaty. 
  One of my objectives in visiting the Korean peninsula was to 
help, if at all possible, in defusing the tension, he noted, and 
said: I wish to reiterate my thanks for an excellent visit, 
which has helped to strengthen relations between the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea and the United Nations.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- Party and state 
leaders of different countries expressed support to the Korean 
people's cause of national reunification when they received the 
DPRK ambassadors to their countries. 
  Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma said the Indian people 
support the proposal for reunifying the country by confederacy 
formula without the interference of outside forces which was put 
forward by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the 
struggle of the Korean people to achieve a peaceful 
reunification of the country. 
  The Indian people, he noted, pay deep attention to the great 
achievements made by the Korean people in all domains of social 
life including the economy, and to the development of the 
situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  Abdoulaye Sekou Sow, prime minister of the government of the 
Republic of Mali, expressed support and solidarity for the 
Korean people in their struggle to realize the proposal for 
reunification by confederacy formula reiterated by respected 
President Kim Il-song in his New Year address, saying it is the 
only just proposal conforming to the reality of Korea. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be resolved 
only through DPRK-U.S. negotiations, he noted. 
  The general secretary of the Independent Liberal Party of 
Nicaragua, Virgilio Godoy, fully supported the policy for 
reunifying the country in the form of confederation on the three 
principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great 
national unity, stating it is a most realistic and fair policy.

dedicate articles to the 20th anniversary of the opening of 
diplomatic relations between the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea and the great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.

  After the opening of diplomatic relations the two peoples 
have hastened the building of a new society supporting and 
closely cooperating with each other under the banner of 
independence against imperialism. 
  The Libyan people are today building a new society at an 
accelerated pace under the guidance of Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, 
leader of the Great September First Revolution. 
  The courageous Libyan people are advancing along the road 
chosen by them, not yielding to the pressure of the imperialists. 
  The Korean people rejoice as over their own over the 
achievements gained by the Libyan people in their efforts for 
the building of a new society, and support their work for a 
peaceful and fair solution to the case of airliner explosion in 
1988. 
  The Korean people will, in the future, too, make active 
efforts to upgrade the friendly relations with the Libyan people. 
  MINJU CHOSON in a by-lined article says the Korean people 
wish the Libyan people greater success in their efforts to build

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- Pak E-ra, 47, is a 
talented dancer widely known to the dancing world and to the 
theatre-goers at home and abroad. 
  All her subtle and powerful movements remind people of a 
dancing girl in her twenties. 
  Each time they see her dancing beautiful dances with a 
bright 
smile of happiness on fascinating stages, people are caught up 
in a flood of thought. It is because she is the prototype of 
Kum-hui, a heroine of the feature film "The Fate of Kum-hui and 
Un-hui", which deals with the fate of twin sisters living 
separated, one in the North and the other in the South of Korea. 
  Born in South Korea where people were struggling for 
existence day in, day out, she was abandoned by her mother who 
was eking out her livelihood by dancing at cabarets. 
  The poor child was embraced in the bosom of the DPRK during 
the fatherland liberation war and has since led a happy life 
under the utmost care and guidance of the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il. 
  She loved dancing from her childhood. When she was a pupil 
of the Manwol Primary School in Kaesong, she appeared on the 
stage of national school children's art festivals several times 
to catch the fancy of experts. 
  Seeing her rare talent, Comrade Kim Chong-il saw to it that 
she was trained at the Pyongyang University of Music and Dance 
for ten odd years till she became a full-fledged dancer. 
  Later, she created many successful dance pieces at such 
leading art troupes as the Pibada Opera Troupe, the Mansudae Art 
Troupe and the Korean People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il appreciated her performances on dozens 
of occasions and assigned her to the title roles of masterpieces 
and guided her with a kind hand, saying that she left good 
impressions and her movements were graceful and exquisite, yet 
lively. 
  She performed the solo dances "youth," "shellfish dance" and 
"fan dance," showing her vibrant and elegant rhythmic movements 
and played the title role in "azalea of the homeland," one of 
the four masterpieces, "spring of the secret camp" and "the 
bosom of the mother party" and many other women's group dances. 
  She performed many dances in operas including the 
revolutionary operas "sea of blood,"" the flower girl" and "a 
true daughter of the party". 
  In this course she became a well-known popular dancer and 
people's actress. 
  She, a dancing instructor of the Korean People's Song and 
Dance Ensemble, is devoting her wisdom and energy to the 
creation of dance works.

  [Text] The 22nd plenary session of the Central Committee of 
the Union of Agricultural Working People [UAWP] was held in 
Pyongyang on 19-20 January. The plenary session was attended by 
members and candidate members of the UAWP Central Committee and 
chairmen of the provincial and city UAWP committees. 
  The plenary session discussed problems of thoroughly 
implementing the task elucidated by the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song in this year's New Year address and the decision of the 
21st plenary session of the Sixth Party Central Committee and 
the problem of thoroughly implementing the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il's recent remarks. 
  Discussions were held after Choe Song-suk, chairman of the 
UAWP Central Committee, gave a report on the first agenda item. 
  The reporter and participants in the discussions said that 
the tasks elucidated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in 
his New Year address of this year and at the 21st plenary 
session of the Sixth party Central Committee are a programmatic 
guideline which brilliantly illuminate the road ahead for our 
people accelerating the general advance of socialism of our own 
style and a militant banner which actively inspires the entire 
nation towards the accomplishment of the sacred cause of 
national reunification and vigorously encourages it towards the 
consummation of the chuche revolutionary cause. 
  Noting that under the wise leadership of the great leader 
and 
our party, the UAWP outstandingly performed the honorable 
mission and duty as the reliable supporter of the party and as 
the thorough defender and implementer of the party's policies 
during the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan, the reporter and 
participants in the discussions referred to the successes 
attained in the course of vigorously carrying out the three 
revolutions of ideology, technology, and culture in rural areas. 
  They stressed that the UAWP today faces the honorable task 
of 
contributing to safeguarding and defending socialism of our own 
style and to further enhancing its superiority by thoroughly 
implementing the party's revolutionary economic strategy. 
  The reporter and participants in the discussions said UAWP 
organizations at all levels should set the next three years as 
an adjustment period for socialist economic construction and 
actively wage a struggle to thoroughly implement the party's 
agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy 
in this period. 
  Saying that all UAWP members should, above all, be brought 
up 
as genuine loyalists and devoted children who bear absolute 
adoration and loyalty toward the great leader and the dear 
comrade leader, they presented concrete measures for effectively 
carrying out the ideological indoctrinations concerning the 
chuche idea theory, the greatness of the party and the leader, 
faithfulness, and revolutionary tradition in various forms and 
methods. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: This year 
is a significant year marking the 30th anniversary of the 
release of the socialist rural theses. We should wage a 
vigorous struggle to complete the historic task of the rural 
theses and mark a new turning point in rural economic 
development. 
  Noting that this year is a significant year marking the 30th 
anniversary of the release of the socialist rural theses, the 
reporter and participants in the discussions said UAWP 
organizations should actively organize and mobilize all union 
members to the struggle to complete the historic task of the 
rural theses and to implement the party's agriculture first 
policy. 
  They said the functions and roles of union organizations at 
all levels will be further enhanced so as to contribute to 
increasing grain production by consolidating the results of 
irrigation and electrification, achieving mechanization and 
scientification on a higher level, and implementing chuche-based 
farming method in rural areas. 
  They stressed that, to this end, UAWP members and 
agricultural workers will actively carry out political 
propaganda and economic agitation [sontong] and strengthen 
various mass movements, including the socialist competition 
movement, so as to highly demonstrate the revolutionary spirit 
of self-reliance and fortitude with the same spirit and vigor 
displayed in the postwar socialist rural construction. 
  In the plenary session, a report was given and discussions 
were held on the second agenda item. 
  Mentioning the tasks recently given by the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il for the working people's groups and 
organizations to carry out human reform works well, the reporter 
and participants said in the discussions that UAWP functionaries 
should ceaselessly expand the ranks of pioneers with laudable 
communist virtue in rural areas by being deeply involved with 
UAWP members, actively support, encourage, and develop positive 
deeds discovered among them, and widely introduce and publicize 
deeds. 
  They stressed that UAWP works should thoroughly become the 
works that will be implemented by union members. They also 
stressed the reinforcement of the union rank by planning and 
carrying out the organizational, ideological, and living 
guidelines for the union members, and further deepening and 
developing the work to create exemplary primary organizations. 
  Relevant decisions were adopted at the plenary session.

<F P=106> ["To Establish New International Order Is Urgent Requirement </F>
of the Times" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- To establish a new 
international order is an urgent requirement of the times and an 
indispensable requirement for the building of a new independent 
world, says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today. 
  The article notes: 
  What is most important in abolishing the old international 
order and establishing a new fair one is to set up a new 
international political order. 
  What is important here is to make the international 
community 
democratic and totally reject the policy of strength. To this 
end, it is particularly important for all countries to respect 
each other's sovereignty. 
  To force one's idea and system upon others is an undisguised 
violation of sovereignty and a wanton interference in internal 
affairs. All the countries and nations must never allow such 
attempt to maintain the order of domination and subordination. 
  Today the policy of strength finds its manifestation in the 
fact that arms buildup is stepped up behind the screen of 
"detente" and "disarmament" and military intervention openly 
committed in other countries under the pretext of "settlement of 
disputes". Highhanded and arbitrary practices should be stopped 
in the international arena and, to this end, it is imperative to 
observe the principle of equality, justice and fairness in 
dealing with international matters. 
  In order to abolish the old international order and 
establish 
a new one, it is necessary to build a new order in the economic 
sector. 
  What is important in establishing a new international 
economic order is to reshape the irrational international 
financial and monetary system, the unequal trading relations 
including non-equivalent exchange and the system of one- sided 
international division of labour and rationally settle the 
problem of foreign debt so as to create favourable circumstances 
for the development and progress of the developing countries. 
To this end the North-South dialogue should be realized and 
further promoted and developed and, at the same time, the 
developed countries should adopt a position to fairly resolve 
pending international economic matters on the principle of 
mutual benefit and equality. 
  In order to establish a new international order, all the 
countries interested in it should strengthen unity and 
cooperation. 
  It is a consistent stand of the government of our Republic 
to 
struggle for the abolition of the old international order and 
the establishment of a new fair one. The government of the 
Republic will as ever wage an active struggle to remove all 
manner of unequal relations in the international area and 
establish a new fair international order.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Calls For Priority to Ideological </F>
Revolution"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- The course of 
building socialism is an untrodden path to create the new and a 
fierce fight to smash the intrigues of the class enemies. 
Therefore, without giving priority to the ideological 
reeducation of the popular masses, it is impossible to 
successfully solve manifold difficult and complicated problems 
in the building of socialism and defend the gains of the 
revolution from the anti-socialist offensive of the imperialists. 
  NODONG SINMUN today stresses this in an article headlined 
"Definite Priority to Conquest of Ideological Fortress, Decisive 
Guarantee for Accomplishment of Socialist Cause." 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is quoted as saying: 
  "If we are to build socialism, we must conquer two 
fortresses, ideological-political and material. 
  "Of the two, it is particularly important to conquer the 
ideological-political fortress." 
  The author of the article says: 
  To conquer the ideological fortress means to educate all 
members of society in revolutionary ideas and assimilating them 
to the working class and the intelligentsia in order to train 
them into versatile communists. 
  In order to build socialist society, two fortresses, 
ideological and material, must be conquered and the conquest of 
the ideological fortress must be given definite priority. 
Because it is a primary and decisive condition for the building 
of socialism. Socialism wins when the popular masses are 
educated in socialist ideology and united on that basis and it 
collapses when they are sick ideologically. The superiority of 
socialism to capitalism is that of ideology and the might of 
socialism lies in that of ideology. 
  The experience in building socialism in Korea clearly shows 
that only when definite priority is given to the conquest of the 
ideological fortress can socialism be built successfully. Our 
party haspbeen able to successfully build socialism because it 
has rallied the masses around the party and the leader, always 
giving definite priority to the ideological revolution. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il propounded the 
chuche-oriented theory that the ideology of man decides 
everything and has constantly rendered greater depth to the work 
of capturing the ideological fortress in keeping with the 
development of the revolution and construction to a higher 
stage. Our people firmly defend the bulwark of socialism, 
foiling the challenges and acts of aggression of the 
imperialists at every step. 
  Especially, the historical lesson of the deplorable 
realities 
of former socialist countries is that the cause of socialism can 
be accomplished only when the conquest of the ideological 
fortress is given priority. The main cause of the frustration 
of socialism in those countries is the neglect of the work for 
the conquest of the ideological fortress. Socialism won at the 
cost of blood was frustrated in those countries because 
socialism lost the powerful motive force for its development and 
failed to get a solid socio- political foundation. 
  Historical facts show that when a country, even if it is a 
big power with strong military forces and vast economic 
potentials, fails to strengthen its driving force and enhance 
its role by giving definite priority to the ideological 
revolution in the building of socialism, it cannot withstand the 
anti-socialist offensive of the imperialists and reactionaries 
and prevent the frustration of socialism.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Calls For Thorough Implementation of </F>
Revolutionary Line of Independence, Self-Sufficiency and 
Self-Reliant Defence"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 23 (KCNA) -- The imperialists and 
reactionary forces are persistently resorting to political and 
military pressure and economic blockade in a bid to stifle the 
DPRK, but the Korean people under the guidance of the party and 
the leader will continue implementing the revolutionary line of 
independence, self-sufficiency and self-reliant defence so as to 
add lustre to the Korean-style socialism centering on the 
popular masses and advance under the uplifted banner of chuche. 
  NODONG SINMUN Sunday stresses this in a signed article 
titled "Justness of Our Party's Line of Independence, 
Self-Sufficiency and Self-Reliant Defence". 
  The article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as 
saying: 
  "In order to meet the requirements of the present situation 
and of the development of our revolution we must implement the 
revolutionary line of independence, self-sufficiency and 
self-reliant defence, step up the three 
revolutions--ideological, technical and cultural--and thus 
further increase the political, economic and military might of 
the country." 
  Ours is the socialism of chuche that is unswervingly guided 
by the chuche idea and that is built and developed through the 
implementation of the revolutionary line of independence, 
self-sufficiency and self-reliant defence, the article says, and 
continues: 
  This line of our party is the most scientific and 
revolutionary line that makes it possible to build socialism of 
Korean style, a society that makes an uninterrupted advance in 
reliance upon its own people, not dependent on others, in all 
realms under any difficult and complex conditions. 
  Along this great revolutionary line the Korean people have 
been able to successfully build a powerful socialist country and 
firmly defend socialism, smashing the never-ceasing aggressive 
moves of the imperialists at every step. 
  The justness and vitality of this revolutionary line of our 
party lie in that they fully guarantee the defence of the 
sovereignty of the country and the nation and an independent and 
creative life of the people in any circumstances. 
  With a solid foundation of independence, self-sufficiency 
and 
self-reliant defence, the Korean people are dynamically pushing 
ahead with socialist construction without the slightest 
deviation, though socialism has suffered setbacks in some 
countries. 
  It is the unshakable stand and will of our party and people 
to hold higher the banner of socialism, the banner of 
revolution, and carry the building of Korean-style socialism to 
completion. 
  The justness and vitality of the line also lie in that they 
make it possible to decisively check the aggression of the 
imperialists and reactionaries and their moves for stifling our 
republic and to defend socialism firmly. 
  Our party and people have strictly maintained the 
revolutionary line of independence, self-sufficiency and 
self-reliant defence in socialist construction, thus making the 
political, economic and military power of the nation invincible. 
Particularly, with the implementation of our party's military 
line of self-reliant defence under the wise guidance of Comrade 
Kim Chong-il, supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, our 
people's Army has grown to be matchless armed forces which can 
destroy any formidable enemy at one blow, either in view of 
politico-ideological superiority or in view of the modernisation 
standard of combat equipment. 
  No matter how persistently the imperialists and reactionary 
forces resort to political and military pressure and economic 
blockade in an effort to stifle our republic, they can never 
demolish our socialism that has risen imposingly as a powerful 
bastion of independence, self-sufficiency and self-reliance in 
national defence, declares the article.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- Large deposits of 
diatom earth have been found in Kangwon, South Hamgyong and 
North Hwanghae Provinces of Korea. 
  This discovery draws the attention of experts for rich 
deposits and good mining conditions. 
  In recent years, Korea has made an effective use of diatom 
earth excavated from various places of the country for the 
development of the national economy. 
  Absorptive, filterable and fire-resisting diatom earth is 
widely used in the building-materials industry, chemical and 
foodstuff industries, agriculture and other domains of the 
national economy. The demand for it is growing at world markets, 
selling at price of about 50 dollars per ton. 
  The demand for diatom earth will increase still further for 
its low per unit cost and increasing economic effectiveness. 
  Korea has made great achievements in the geological survey 
for a scientific analysis of the deposited conditions and 
circumstances of diatom earth and its extensive development.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- Kaesong is situated 
160 kilometres south of Pyongyang. 
  Kaesong is attracting tourists because it was the capital of 
the Koryo Dynasty (918-1392), a unified state which existed 
nearly 500 years and it is the home of Koryo Insam (ginseng) and 
a city near the Military Demarcation Line. 
  There are many scenic spots in and around the city. 
  Among them are Pakyon falls, one of the three best water 
falls in Korea, historic remains such as the wall on Mt. Taehung 
and the Taeung hall of the Kwanum temple in its neighbourhood. 
Beautiful mountains, strangely shaped rocks, crystal-clear 
water, fascinating waterfall blend well with the time-honoured 
historic remains, presenting a wonderful beauty and taking the 
fancy of the visitors. 
  Preserved in their original state in the city are more than 
100 important historic monuments belonging to the Koryo Dynasty, 
among them the Koryo Songgyungwan academy, the South gate of 
Kaesong, the Sonjuk bridge, Manwoldae (the site of the royal 
palace), Chomsongdae and the Anhwa temple. 
  Drawing particular attention of the tourists are the tombs 
of 
King Wang Kon, the founder of the Koryo Dynasty, and King 
Kongmin, its 31st king. The tombs show well the excellent grave 
architecture of the Korean nation. 
  Panmunjom that is still a place of showdown between peace 
and 
war belongs to Kaesong municipality. 
  Situated there are the conference room of the military 
armistice commission, the room of Korean armistice talks and the 
hall where the armistice agreement was signed on July 27, 1953 
and the evidences of those days. 
  Visible at Panmunjom is the concrete wall built in the area 
South of the Military Demarcation Line, which divides Korea into 
the North and the South. The wall stretching more than 240 
kilometres from the east to the west across 8 counties divided 
122 villages and cut off 3 highways and upwards of 220 roads 
and railway lines. 
  The visitors to the city can see at first hand and purchase 
the real Koryo insam and its processed goods, widely known as 
the elixir of life. 
  Tourists can board and lodge in Korean style at the national 
hotel. And they can taste Yakbap, ball-shape Kimchi, roasted 
chicken with Kaesong insam inside it and Kaesong insam wine 
peculiar to Kaesong. 
  Foreign tourists spend a good time, guided by the kind 
officials of the international travel company of the DPRK.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 25 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said on Tuesday evening Seoul will continue to exert 
diplomatic efforts to get the North Korean nuclear issues 
resolved peacefully. 
  "But, whether or not it would be necessary to carry on 
efforts for its peaceful resolution will be determined in the 
next two to three weeks," Han said. 
  The minister's remarks were taken to suggest that if the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) fails to reach a 
satisfactory accord with North Korea by the time the next IAEA 
Board of Governors meeting opens on Feb. 21, the nuclear 
question could be referred to the U.N. Security Council for 
necessary action. 
  While answering questions after he delivered a speech at the 
Korean-America Friendship Society, Minister Han said that if 
North Korea comes to possess nuclear arms, the danger of 
conventional armed clash on the Korean peninsula grows much 
larger. 
  Regarding world powers' view of Korean unification, the 
foreign minister said the four powers having stakes in the 
Korean peninsula seem wanting to see Korea remain divided as now. 
  "Though the world powers do not favor our unification, they 
won't do anything outright to obstruct it if and when 
unification is achieved," he added. 
  Minister Han also said it is natural for South Korea to 
share 
the expense of the U.S. forces in Korea to a certain extent. 
  For, the U.S. forces here perform a role South Korea needs 
though their presence is due in part to the U.S.' own interests, 
he said.

Saturday.

giving up his Korean citizenship and seeking political asylum. 
  It is not immediately known how the Seoul government will 
respond. 
  Kim, who was a trusted aide to President No Tae-u, left the 
country when authorities started investigating him on suspicion 
of receiving bribes while he was in Chongwadae.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- Kim Chong-hwi, a 
former senior presidential secretary for foreign and national 
security affairs, applied for permanent U.S. residentship in 
early December, it was disclosed Friday. 
  Kim, 59, is wanted in South Korea for questioning in 
connection with irregularities in the Yulgok military buildup 
project. He fled to the United States shortly after authorities 
started to investigate people involved in the Yulgok project. 
  Informed sources said that Kim submitted an application for 
permanent residentship in early December at a local office of 
the U.S. immigration and naturalization service through his 
lawyer. 
  Details are not known, the sources said. 
  There is a possibility that Kim is seeking permanent 
residency in the United States to avoid criminal prosecution in 
Seoul as his visa is expected to run out before a new president 
takes office. 
  An official at the Korean Embassy said that although there 
were rumors that Kim was seeking political asylum in the United 
States, the reports were "exaggerated." 
  "He is not qualified for political asylum since he is a 
criminal suspect in the Yulgok military project," the official 
said, requesting anonymity. 
  The official said he could not confirm that Kim had applied 
for permanent U.S. residentship, but he may be allowed to live 
in the United States, depending on his qualifications.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 22 (YONHAP) -- South Korea may ask the 
United States not to grant permanent residency to a former 
presidential aide suspected of a crime. 
  "We can deliver our own position on the matter and seek 
Washington's support from the perspective of cooperation on 
criminal matters," Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said 
Saturday, suggesting that Seoul may oppose issuance of a 
residency permit. 
  The embassy in Washington has been instructed to formally 
confirm reports that Kim has asked for a residency permit, 
commonly called a "green card." 
  Kim, chief aide for diplomacy and national security under 
President No Tae-u, went to the United States in April last year 
as a guest researcher at the heritage foundation. Just few 
months after departure, an investigation implicated him in the 
taking of massive bribes in connection with the "Yulgok 
(military modernization)" project. 
  Hong said the government learned about a week ago of Kim's 
application for a green card. 
  "We will consult with the Justice Ministry in deciding what 
to do, if we need to ask for U.S. cooperation," he said. "But 
canceling Kim's passport is not an option under consideration."

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 21 (YONHAP) -- Government leaders and 
politicians reacted with anger and dismay Saturday to the report 
that Former Senior Presidential Secretary for Foreign and 
National Security Affairs Kim Chong-hwi has applied for 
permanent U.S. residentship. 
  Sharp criticism and disgust had been levelled against him 
when he fled the country for the United States as President Kim 
Yong-sam's anti-corruption campaign reached the once untouchable 
military buildup projects known as the Yulgok program. 
  Kim has come under suspicion of receiving bribes by 
allegedly 
peddling influence as a trusted aide to President No Tae-u. 
  Officials at Chongwadae [presidential office] received the 
news with stunned disbelief as the reports said Kim might be 
seeking a political asylum in the United States. 
  "How could he, once a prominent public servant, sell himself 
out to a foreign country just because he is being pursued by the 
law of his country as a criminal?" asked one Chongwadae 
official said, requesting anonymity. [sentence as received] 
  Political asylum is usually asked by those whose life is 
threatened by dictators or by other colonial overlords. It is 
not something given by a foreign country to a criminal on the 
run, he said. 
  It was being reported Saturday that the Seoul government is 
considering using diplomatic channels to the United States to 
ask the U.S. Government to reject Kim's application for 
permanent residentship. 
  "Kim Chong-hwi had pretended that he was a clean official," 
said another Chongwadae official. "He never even bought a cup of 
coffee for other officials. 
  "If he is that clean, why doesn't he come home and answer 
the 
charges?" 
  Aides to former President No were also expressing their 
disgust, calling Kim a "disgrace to the Sixth Republic." 
  Since he once commanded the nation's foreign and security 
policy from a prestigous and exulted position, he should have 
come home when his mother died and buried her and answered 
questions by the prosecution, rather than abusing his former 
position and seeking political asylum in another country, they 
said. 
  Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party [DLP], told reporters: "It is big trouble. 
  "All politicians are responsible for their country. How 
could the man act like that? I simply couldn't understand his 
mentality." 
  "I cannot help doubting about the stability of his mind," 
said Rep. So Chong-hwa. "If he is really seeking political 
asylum, it's a mind-boggling thing to do." 
  There have been a lot of "problems" with the previous 
administration but this case aptly and glaringly illustrates the 
real character of the No government, another DLP lawmaker said. 
  The main opposition Democratic Party [DP], meanwhile, is 
trying to make a political issue out of the affair. 
  The DP defined it as a product of the current 
administration's "unfair and unbalanced" prosecution of corrupt 
officials. 
  In an official commentary, DP Deputy Spokesman Kwon Il-sun 
said that there had been suggestions the current administration 
could have helped Kim escape to the United States even though he 
had been the main player in irregularities in connection with 
the selection of the mainstay fighter aircraft. 
  Noting that the U.S. Government should not grant political 
asylum to Kim Chong-hwi, he said, "the Seoul government should 
recall Kim at any cost following talks with the U.S. Government 
through diplomatic channels."

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 23 (YONHAP) -- Assistant U.S. Trade 
Representative Nancy Adams will visit Seoul on Thursday to 
fine-tune with government officials an agenda of the coming 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Committee of Trade and 
Investment (CTI) meeting slated for Jan.31-Feb. 1 in Jakarta. 
  She will meet with Assistant Foreign Minister Son Chun-yong

officials said. 
  The two will also discuss how Korea and the United States 
should cooperate in promoting trade and investment in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  In the Jakarta meeting, Korea will offer to lay a bridge 
between the United States, Japan and other advanced countries in 
the region on the one side and China, Southeast Asian nations 
and other developing countries on the other side for increased 
economic cooperation between them, the officials said.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea rebuffed 
the kind of inspection required by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) at the latest contact in Vienna, and the 
agency is intent on not sending the inspection team without a 
pre-agreement on all details, State Department spokeswoman 
Christine Shelly said Monday. 
  The issue will be put to international agenda next month 
when 
the IAEA holds board of governors meeting, she said. 
  The IAEA wants to conduct specific tests to verify that 
North 
Korea did not divert any nuclear material since the last 
inspection and to allow future verification while ensuring 
continuity in safeguards, Shelly told a noon briefing. 
  "North Korea, while agreeing with a number of the planned 
measures, indicated that a significant number of other required 
measures, ones that were outlined by the IAEA, would not be 
allowed," she explained. 
  "The IAEA will not send an inspection team to North Korea 
unless there is full agreement on the safeguard measures which 
have been specified and have been judged necessary for a 
meaningful inspection," said Shelly. 
  While predicting a "formal review on this" at the February 
board meeting, the spokeswoman emphasized the complexity of the 
situation. 
  The United States or the security council will call a halt 
when "they feel that there is nothing meaningful" in ongoing 
talks. 
  "This is not a simple issue," she said. 
  But Washington is hopeful still of a settlement, according 
to 
Shelly, "I think the fact that North Korea is in Vienna and is 
trying to work out the details with the IAEA is an indication 
that they are committed to finding a resolution to the problem." 
  There was no planned contact with North Korea in New York, 
she added.

  [Text] Berlin, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- North Korea and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) held a working-level 
contact in Vienna Monday to discuss problems related to the 
IAEA's inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, IAEA 
spokesman Hans Meyer said. 
  At the two-hour meeting, the two sides agreed to meet again 
Tuesday, Meyer said. He declined to disclose details of 
Monday's talks. 
  Informed sources said North Korea conveyed its position on 
the IAEA demand on the scope of its inspection. It was not 
known, however, whether the two sides made any progress in 
Monday's talks held at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna.

<F P=106> [By Pak Tu-sik] </F>
  [Text] It was learned that the U.S.-North Korea 
working-level contact, held in New York on 5 January, came to an 
end after "having agreed to disagree." 
  The contents of their agreement is relatively simple. That 
is: North Korea will accept ad hoc and ordinary inspections of 
seven declared nuclear facilities in Yongbyon demanded by 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
  The Status of Agreement on Disagreement. [subhead] 
  However, North Korea interprets acceptance of inspections to 
mean the acceptance of "limited inspection for maintaining the 
continuity of nuclear safeguards measures, not the 'regular 
inspection' which member nations of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] are obliged to undergo," while the Western camp, 
including the ROK and the United States, interpret it to 
actually mean "the acceptance of full-scale ad hoc and ordinary 
inspections." 
  Both the ROK and the United States chose the position that 
"North Korea's complete return to NPT is the main agenda for the 
third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks that are to be 
resumed after inspections are conducted. Therefore, whether the 
number of inspection is one time or not is not a serious 
question." In other words, the negotiations were for North 
Korea to find justification [myongbun] and for the practical 
interest of the ROK and the United States. 
  Negotiations between North Korea and IAEA have dragged on 
for 
much longer than expected. In a recent negotiation, North Korea 
raised the issue pertaining to interpretation of the "agreement 
to disagree." Concerning "the inspection plan and list" where 
all seven facilities are targets of inspection, North Korea 
questioned: What relationship does this plan and list have with 
continuing nuclear inspections? 
  Relationship With "Continuity of Inspection." [subhead] 
  From North Korea's point of view, the question of North 
Korea's full return to NPT membership is an important card in 
forthcoming negotiations with the United States. 
  Therefore, North Korea may be planning to clearly delineate 
this issue in negotiation with the IAEA. The abrupt 21 January 
statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman might 
have been prompted by such a strategy. 
  It was learned that a similar situation occurred in 
consecutive contacts held between North Korea and IAEA on 17 and 
18 January. 
  Meanwhile, it is the IAEA's position that the continuity of 
nuclear safeguards measures cannot be guaranteed if North Korea 
refuses to accept the whole lists put forward by the IAEA, and 
if North Korea fails to send a reply on this issue by the end of 
this month, the IAEA must declare a "breakup" in continuity 
during its regular Board of Governors meeting slated for 22 
February. 
  Variable Factors, Including the Two Kims' Birthdays. 
[subhead] 
  Since the IAEA agrees that forthcoming inspections are not 
"regular inspections" conducted on NPT member states and North 
Korea is not opposed to the inspection of seven facilities 
itself, the road to an agreement is unlikely to be difficult. 
At least, this speculation was dominant until the end of 
U.S.-North Korea contact in New York. Nevertheless, North Korea 
is dragging the talks along without presenting a clear 
explanation. The reason for this can be interpreted in several 
ways. 
  First, North Korea may need to buy time to adjust internal 
opinion on the results of the New York negotiation, or they may 
have decided that if they are to accept IAEA's inspections, to 
make the most of it. However, there are a number of hurdles 
lying before these delaying tactics of North Korea. 
  For instance, the IAEA's Board of Governors' meeting is 
scheduled to be held in a little over a month and the North 
Koreans need to keep an eye out for Kim Chong-il's 52nd birthday 
on February 16. 
  Since North Korea celebrates birthdays of Kim Il-song and 
Kim 
Chong-il as an extraordinary national holiday, it usually 
refrains from taking any external action during this period. 
Therefore, North Korea must settle the issue of IAEA's 
inspection before this day. Thus, the North Korean nuclear 
issue faces another time limit.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 25 (YONHAP) -- The government held a 
unification-related ministers' meeting Tuesday to discuss ways 
to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem and resume 
inter-Korean dialogue, officials of the National Unification 
Board (NUB) said. 
  The ministers decided to readjust the government's long-term 
atomic energy policy in an effort to push the country into the 
level of advanced nations as soon as possible, the officials 
said. 
  At the same time, the government will preprare for possible 
mutual nuclear inspection with North Korea by setting up a body, 
tentatively named "The Atomic Energy Control Center," the 
ministers agreed. The center is to be established soon under 
the Science and Technology Ministry. 
  The meeting, presided over by Deputy Prime Minister and NUB 
Minister Yi Yong-tok, also decided to make efforts to find a 
breakthrough through exchange of special envoys with Pyongyang 
and make active efforts to reach within this year "the 
reconciliation and cooperation stage," the first stage of the 
government's three-stage unification formula, by improving the 
inter-Korean relations. 
  The second stage is "the Korean Commonwealth stage," while 
the third is "the unified Korea stage." 
  The government reaffirmed its position that for a solution 
to 
the North Korean nuclear issue, Pyongyang has to return fully to 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, accept International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection and agree in principle to mutual 
nuclear inspection with the South. 
  Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Yi told the 14 ministers 
who 
attended the meeting to consult at any time with the NUB before 
making their policies related to unification in order to 
maintain a consistent government policy on North Korea.

  [Text] The government held the 15th meeting of 
unification- related ministers on the morning of 25 January at 
the Office of South-North Dialogue in Samchong-tong, Seoul. In 
the meeting presided by Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and 
minister of the National Unification Board, they discussed 
important pending issues such as the resolution of the North 
Korean nuclear issue and resumption of South-North dialogue. 
  The meeting participants expressed concern about the fact 
that negotiations between North Korea and the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] over the nuclear inspection issue 
are being delayed further than expected, and they decided to 
urge North Korea to allow the inspection by the IAEA as soon as 
possible. 
  The unification-related ministers also expressed their 
regret 
over South-North dialogue, which has remained deadlocked for 
over one year because of the North Korean nuclear issue. They 
agreed to accelerate South-North economic cooperation, including 
the promotion of businessmen's visits to the North, when a 
breakthrough to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue is found. 
  Regarding North Korea-IAEA negotiations over the nuclear 
inspection issue, a government official said: "North Korea must 
allow nuclear inspections no later than 21 February when the 
next regular meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors is to be 
held." He added: "The negotiations on nuclear inspections have 
been delayed because of differences in opinion between the IAEA 
and North Korea about the characteristic of inspections 
[sacharui songgyok munje].

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 22 (YONHAP) -- Ian Roy Kenyon, who heads 
up an effort to launch a global campaign against chemical 
weapons, will visit Seoul on Sunday, the Foreign Ministry said 
Saturday. 
  Kenyon, coming as a guest of the assistant foreign minister 
for policy planning, is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister 
Han Sung-chu and other government officials during his three-day 
stay. He is also to meet leaders of the chemical industry. 
  His title is secretary-general of the committee preparing to 
launch the Organization of the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons 
(OPCW), the main body that will implement the chemical weapons 
convention. 
  The convention opened for signing in January last year and 
will take effect 180 days after 65 nations ratify it, but not 
before two years have elapsed. 
  South Korea signed in January but North Korea, a suspected 
chemical weapons country, has yet to do so. 
  Seoul officials plan to promise active participation in the 
preparation process and seek seats on the 41-member OPCW 
executive council.

  [Text] In the event that separated family members and 
businessmen of the ROK want to contact North Korean residents or 
to visit North Korea, the government plans to allow only those 
who completed a course of education on reunification in the 
educational institute under the National Unification Board 
[NUB]. Having formulated this policy on 22 January, the NUB is 
going to discuss concrete curricula in the course of education 
and to implement them from April at the earliest. For those who 
visited North Korea in the past in connection with North-South 
dialogue including high-level talks and sports talks, the Agency 
for National Security Planning conducted prior education. 
However, no education was conducted in advance for separated 
family members and businessmen who wanted to contact North 
Korean residents in a third country. 
  According to the new policy, the separated family members 
and 
businessmen who want to visit North Korea or to meet their 
relatives and friends living in North Korea will be required to 
attach to the request for visit to North Korea a statement on 
personal background, the exit report and permit, North Korean 
side's memorandum on insurance of personal safety, and a 
certificate of completion of education by the NUB.

<F P=106> [YONHAP from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] It was learned on 22 January that North Korea 
recently established a South Korean affairs operation team 
within the Workers' Party of Korea, which is operating 
successfully in large- scale operations in China to attract ROK 
students, traders, tourists, and businessmen who have visited 
China frequently since the establishment of ROK-Sino diplomatic 
relations in August 1992. 
  A well-informed source in North Korea's situation in China 
said: North Korea's large-scale operation organization, which is 
directed by the South Korean affairs operation team, is briskly 
conducting operations mainly in three districts -- Northeastern 
area, including Yinji City; Beijing; and Shanghai-- where ROK 
citizens have visited frequently. North Korea's operation 
agents are attracting ROK citizens by making pro-North Korean 
compatriots responsible for a small operation base.

  [Text] The main opposition Democratic Party [DP] said 
yesterday it is opposed to President Kim Yong-sam's plan to 
visit China in late March. 
  DP spokesman Rep. Pak Chi-won issued a statement attacking 
President Kim's planned tour to Beijing as contrary to the 
principle of "reciprocity." 
  "Former President No Tae-u first made an official visit to 
China in September 1992, while in office," Pak said. 
  "Therefore, according to the principle of reciprocity, the 
Chinese head of state, President Jiang Zemin, has to pay a visit 
to Seoul this time," Pak insisted. 
  If President Kim goes through with his plan to China, the 
criticism will be unavoidable that his administration hasn't yet 
broken away from diplomatic flunkeyism, Pak said. 
  President Kim himself has said that his new administration 
would carry out its diplomatic policies on an equal footing with 
the world's super powers, calling it a "new diplomacy," said Pak. 
  "We are worried Kim is not keeping his own word. We also 
fear that the so-called new diplomacy may turn into a new 
slavish diplomacy," Pak said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korea is looking 
for various ways on getting repaid for loans to the former 
Soviet Union, including material repayment in enriched uranium 
and bunker C oil, an envoy said Tuesday. 
  "Possibility is not that high at this moment," said Kim 
Sok-kyu, South Korean Ambassador to Moscow, "but we are studying 
these ideas because of the precedent of being repaid in 
aluminum." 
  Kim temporarily returned to Seoul last week to brief the 
government on recent developments in Russia and to coordinate 
Seoul's policy toward Moscow. 
  The Paris Club will provide a rough guideline on repayment 
schedule for South Korea, Kim told a press conference, and an 
inter- ministerial discussion with Finance and Trade, Industry 
and Resources Ministries will find various alternatives. 
  Seoul promised 3 billion U.S. dollars in financial aid to 
the former communist country but delivered only 1.47 billion 
dollars and suspended the rest at the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. 
  Seoul has received a list of arms Russia offered for joint 
development and production, another alternative to loan 
repayment, but the government will need prudent review before 
making any decision, said Kim. 
  On North Korea-Russia relations, the envoy said Moscow 
proposed vice minister-level talks to North Korea from this year 
but is yet to receive a reply. 
  "North Korea and Russia are gradually restoring their 
relations of dialogue," he told reporters. 
  Moscow has not abandoned human rights issue with Pyongyang 
and is determined to insert the rights clause for the workers in 
a new agreement on operating North Korean lumber yard, he said. 
  President Boris Yeltsin said he wants his South Korean 
counterpart Kim Yong-sam to make certain to visit Russia this 
year, and the two countries will consult on this issue, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 25 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry is 
studying a plan to introduce some Russian weapons for use in 
training and research programs, a senior ministry official said 
on Tuesday. 
  Han Sung-ui, a ministry policy planning officer, said, 
however, it would be difficult to bring in Russian weapons for 
the purpose of beefing up the weaponry of the armed forces. 
  "If some Russian weapons were introduced, they would be used 
in their experimental studies, anti-air training and the study 
of Russian operational tactics and doctrine," Han said. 
  He made the remarks before a group of reporters in 
connection 
with the recent Russian offer to repay credits Korea extended to 
Russia with their weapons. 
  Han also said the time has come for the country to 
positively 
promote military cooperation with Russia and Japan mainly 
through the exchange of military students and top military 
leaders. 
  The government's basic policy, he said, is to continue to 
place emphasis on military cooperation with the United States. 
  "But, our policy also calls for cooperation with neighborly 
countries in the military area as well," Han said. 
  He said stepped up military cooperation with these countries 
will help keep them from furnishing offensive weapons to North 
Korea, induce North Korea to reforms and opening, and contribute 
to laying a groundwork for stability and peace in Northeast Asia.

  [Text] The government plans to provide financial aid to 
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) when a legitimate 
recipient body is set up, officials said yesterday. 
  An official who refused to be identified said that the PLO 
is 
expected to set up an interim committee soon to receive 
financial aid from the world for the rehabilitation of the Gaza 
Strip and the West Bank city of Jericho. 
  Seoul expressed its will to support rehabilitation of the 
autonomous region at multilateral talks in Washington Oct. 2-3 
last year. Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu attended the talks 
co-chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. 
  The talks were the first international ones held to handle 
the aid program since Israel and the PLO signed a peace accord 
in Washington early last September. 
  "We are unable to discuss the aid program as no recipient 
body has yet been set up by the PLO," the official said. 
  But inter-ministerial consultations are under way on the 
methods of financial aid to the PLO following the establishment 
of a recipient body, he said. 
  He said he is quite sure that the aid program will be 
discussed bilaterally with the PLO, not international bodies or 
Israel. 
  Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres telephoned his Korean 
counterpart Han to support the rehabilitation of the autonomous 
region of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, shortly 
after the signing of the peace accord. 
  It is expected that the government will extend soft loans 
from the Economic Development and Cooperation Fund (EDCF). The 
EDCF is a government-managed fund for developing nations. 
  But other officials did not rule out that nonrefundable aid 
would also be delivered although in small amounts. 
  The United States has projected collecting contributions 
through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. 
  At present, no country has extended aid to PLO for the same 
reason as Korea and also because of the uncertainty of the 
Middle East peace. 
  PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat also expressed hope for assistance 
from South Korea in a recent interview with KBS [Korea 
Broadcasting System]. 'Arafat is familiar with North Korean 
leaders, having visited Pyongyang several times. 
  South Korea has no formal diplomatic ties with the PLO but 
has already recognized its identity.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 22 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul District Public 
Prosecutors' Office Saturday questioned Pak Kun-po, president of 
the Pusan Chemical Co., and three other people about a complaint 
filed by Pusan charging Yi Chol-hui and Chang Yong-cha with 
fraud. 
  Prosecutors asked them the details of how Pusan made a 
contract with Kim Chu-sung, son-in-law of Yi and Chang. 
  Yi and Chang will be summoned early next week, a prosecution 
spokesman said. 
  Pusan, a footwear maker, Thursday accused the couple and Kim 
of fraud over a deal to sell 6,976 square meters of land in 
Pusan to Pusan that fell through because Chohung Bank had a lien 
on the land. 
  Kim, who had received 2.3 billion won from Pusan as contract 
deposit, gave Pusan a promissory note for 4.25 billion won (5.25 
million U.S. dollars) as breach-of-contract damages. The note, 
issued by Kim and endorsed by Yi and Chang, was later dishonored.

  [Excerpts] Lieutenant General Tin U, secretary 2 of the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], met and 
delivered an address on matters concerning the rule of law, 
local tranquillity and stability, and the reduction and 
eradication of crimes to the members of the Yangon [Rangoon] 
Division's district, and township law and order restoration 
councils; responsible personnel from the departments under the 
Home Ministry and the People's Force Headquarters; regional 
commanders, responsible personnel of the Yangon City Development 
Committee [YCDC], judges from divisions, districts and 
townships, and legal officers at the meeting hall of the YCDC at 
1300. 
  In his address Lt. Gen. Tin U cited and explained Prime 
Minister Senior General Than Shwe's directive and guideline on 
administrative mechanism in detail. He said responsible 
personnel should not perform their jobs as usual during the 
revolutionary period in which the old system and era are being 
dismantled and a new system and era are being built in the 
country. Responsible personnel have to exert more effort in 
order to carry out their work and responsibilities with sharp 
and innovative minds, and with diligence and perseverance. He 
continued that the dignity of the people and the nation will be 
affected if Yangon City becomes dirty and there is an increase 
in robbery, muggings, pickpocket incidences, and other illegal 
activities. All of these activities run counter to the 
character of the city and result if there is a breakdown in the 
rule of law. That is why Yangon is being renovated from all 
sides to retain the character of the city. Moreover, it is very 
important to have discipline, to observe laws, and to establish 
local tranquillity effectively and efficiently. 
  He also said there is a serious need for state employees 
from 
various public service organizations to understand the political 
situation during the change of system and era. They must also 
understand that they should use their authority, bestowed on 
them by the state, in a proper way and not to abuse their power. 
[passage omitted on objectives of law and order restoration 
council in various regions]. 
  He continued that the SLORC will effectively prevent and 
defend any form of action that can cause the disappearance of 
rule of law and that will allow anarchy to prevail in the 
country. Law and order restoration councils have to take a 
leading role to implement local ty/ty and ensure the prevalence 
of rule of law in the respective regions. All public service 
organizations have to cooperate and work together to the benefit 
of regions and localities. 
  He added that there is need to take effective action against 
those public service organizations which do not cooperate with 
others. The law and order restoration councils at ward level 
are basic administrative organizations; therefore, these 
councils should be supervised with the help of ward leaders in 
order to carry out their work honestly, bravely, and without 
corruption. He said the state administrative mechanism must be 
effective and efficient to establish a peaceful and modern 
country. It is also very important for the administrative 
mechanism to become an instrument which can support the 
all-around development of the country. He noted that it does 
not matter how good the systems and ideas to be practiced are if 
people disobey the law and have no discipline. This results in 
a lack of development for the country and the country then will 
face the greater danger of being wiped from the world map. 
  He said the SLORC, for the long-term benefit of the state, 
is 
taking effective action against criminal acts that can destroy 
local ty/ty. He also warned that effective action will taken 
against public service personnel, who conduct themselves badly, 
and without any discrimination. In conclusion, he said various 
levels of law and order restoration councils in the respective 
regions have to take a leading role and supervise their areas 
bravely and properly for the development of the country and for 
peace and stability. He said the departments have to coordinate 
and cooperate amongst each other without employing 
discrimination as they carry out their responsibilities. He 
said responsible personnel have to disclose the names of those 
who take bribes from criminals and take effective action against 
them. He also reminded responsible personnel not to punish 
innocent people by mistake when handing down sentences to 
prevent the crimes. He urged responsible personnel to work hard 
to become a person who is respected by the people. He also told 
them to avoid accepting all gifts and bribes. [passage omitted 
on similar speeches by Lt. Gen. Mya Thinn, minister of home 
affairs; and Lt. Gen. Myo Nyunt, chairman of Rangoon division 
LORC] The meeting ended at 1500.

  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 21 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Malaysian 
International Industry and Trade Minister Rafidah Aziz has 
ensured the presence of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed at the 
next meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum to be held in Indonesia in November this year. After a 
meeting with Indonesian Trade Minister S.B. Judono here Friday, 
Minister Rafidah Aziz said Prime Minister Mahathir will surely 
attend the next informal meeting of the leaders of the APEC 
member countries. 
  Like the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), both APEC and the 
East 
Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC) are expected to boost cooperation 
among nations, including those in the ASEAN region, she said. 
  Economic ministers of the ASEAN member countries will also 
hold a meeting in Kuala Lumpur in April 1995 to discuss a long 
term program of the organization which groups Malaysia, 
Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Brunei 
Darussalam, she said. The Kuala Lumpur meeting, according to 
Minister Rafidah Aziz, is expected to also discuss the Uruguay 
Round of GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs). ASEAN 
has a common interest in the results of the agreement, she said. 
  The Malaysian minister said that during the meeting with her 
counterpart, Trade Minister S.B. Judono, both sides agreed to 
sign an agreement on investment guarantee on Saturday (January 
22) and to amend the previous trade accord between the two 
countries. Trade relations between the two countries have been 
running smoothly so far, she said. 
  Meanwhile, Minister Judono said there is always a 
possibility 
of accelerating the implementation of the Common Effective 
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) from 15 years to 10 years as Malaysia 
has suggested. However, he said "We should first implement what 
was agreed upon by the ASEAN member countries last year and see 
how the progress is." 
  Indonesia's exports to the neighbouring country include 
tobacco, paper, vegetable oil, coal and textiles, while its 
imports among other things are steel, chemical substance and 
machinery. 
  The total value of the bilateral trade in 1992 reached about 
one billion dollars, with a deficit of 37 million US dollars for 
Indonesia. 
  During the first semester of last year, Indonesia recorded a 
trade surplus from its exports worth 326.3 million dollars to 
Malaysia, while its imports worth only 198.8 million dollars.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and Albanian 
President Dr. Sali Berisha held bilateral talks in Kuala Lumpur 
this afternoon. Prime Minister Mahathir offered to share 
Malaysia's experience in privatization to assist Albania in 
developing its free trade zone. Albania has also embarked on a 
privitization program of its state-owned enterprises. 
  According to Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, 
during the two-hour meeting at the Prime Minister's Department, 
President Berisha extended an invitation to Defense Minister 
Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak to visit Albania. The aim is to let 
him study the possibility of promoting bilateral defense 
cooperation. 
  Responding to a newsmen's question on whether or not 
Malaysia 
will use Albania as a gateway for exports of its goods to other 
parts of Europe, Datuk Abdullah said: 
  [Begin Abdullah Ahmad Badawi recording] First, we must study 
in detail the taxation system in that country and if we think 
that it is suitable and can serve our purposes, perhaps we can 
use Albania as a gateway for our goods to enter the European 
markets. [end recording] 
  In another development, Malaysia and Albania today signed 
five agreements to promote closer ties between the two 
countries. The agreements include trade cooperation; investment 
guarantees; avoidance of double taxation; and cooperation on 
economy, science, and technology. The signing ceremony was 
witnessed by Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir and the 
Albanian president, Dr. Sali Berisha, who is on a four-day visit 
to Malaysia.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 25 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- The 
international community is taking too long to act against the 
blatant aggression by Serbia on Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yang 
Di-pertuan Agong (the Malaysian king) Sultan Azlan Shah said 
Monday. 
  For too long, the international community has failed to act 
against the blatant aggression by Serbia on the independence, 
sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
the atrocious violation and abuse of human rights of the Bosnian 
people, he said at a state banquet in honour of visiting 
Albanian President Dr. Sali Berisha at Istana Negara (the 
palace) here. He said there was no excuse, whatsoever, not to 
act against the Serbs to end the violence and suffering of an 
entire nation and people and to restore peace and stability in 
that region. 
  His majesty said although Malaysia and Albania were far from 
each other geographically, Malaysians were well aware that the 
ugly conflict and ethnic cleansing occurring in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina cast a long and dark shadow over Albania and 
the entire Balkan region. 
  We understand and share your anxiety and concern on a 
possible spillover of the war into Albania, threatening your 
peace and stability. Indeed the tense situation in Kosovo is 
also of grave concern, he said. 
  Berisha, in his speech, praised Malaysians for their 
generous 
political, technical, and economic assistance to Albania and 
added that Malaysia was among the first countries to offer help 
after Albania decided to adopt an open policy. 
  He said Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's visit to 
Albania last year opened a new and important page in the 
relations between the two countries and in strengthening the 
friendship between their peoples. 
  The friendly relations and cooperation with Malaysia were of 
special importance to Albanians, he said. 
  Indeed, our two peoples and countries, though located far 
apart geographically, are always closer with their feelings and 
hearts. This, first of all, because of the historical spiritual 
links and of the common values they share, he said. 
  Berisha said both countries with a Muslim majority were 
characterised by the religious pluralism and at the same time by 
the religious harmony. 
  Berisha also praised Malaysia for its great concern about 
the 
situation in the Balkans as well as its efforts through 
political activity and participation in the peacekeeping forces 
in the region in order to provide a solution for the crisis.

  [Text] The Republic of Singapore Air Force [SAF] has 
acquired four Fokker-50 aircraft. They are to replace a fleet 
of 20-year old Skyvans which have been gradually phased out. 
MinDef [Ministry of Defense] said the Fokker-50s are capable of 
carrying a heavy load and flying longer non-stop distances. 
They will also be modified to extend flying time and fuel 
endurance by an additional four hours. The new aircraft were 
unveiled at Changi airbase today during a visit of the Acting 
Prime Minister and Defense Minister Dr Yeo Ning Hong to the 
Changi airbase. It is a part of his regular visit to the SAF

<F P=106> ["J.-C.P." report: "Mr. Longuet's Visit Illustrates the </F>
Development of Cooperation with France"] 
  [Text] Hanoi -- One year after Francois Mitterrand's 
visit, cooperation between Vietnam and France seems to have 
reached cruising speed, as witnessed by the first visit by a 
member of the Balladur government, in this case the minister of 
industry, post and telecommunications, and foreign trade. 
Before leaving Hanoi for Hue and Ho Chi Minh City on Tuesday 18 
January, Gerard Longuet, who headed a delegation of 35 
businessmen, said that Vietnam could become "a platform to 
reexport" French products in the region. 
  French aid to Hanoi for 1994 is around 550 million French 
francs [Fr], including the Fr85-million contribution to the 
payment of the Vietnamese debt to the IMF. The rest is divided 
between Treasury donations and loans (Fr250 million), credits 
from the French Development Fund (Fr110 million in project 
contributions), and the cooperation package (Fr108.5 million). 
The funds allocated between 1990 and 1992 under the three 
previous financial agreements have been completely exhausted, 
and those provided by the fourth, signed in Paris on 8 November, 
should also be exhausted. 
  During a visit to Vietnam from 11 through 13 January, 
Jacques 
Chirac expressed the Right's desire to "pursue and develop" the 
previous governments' Vietnamese policy. This desire to accept 
the Socialists' legacy is confirmed by the visits announced for 
the next few months by Jacques Toubon (culture and 
French-speaking affairs), Simone Veil (social affairs), Edmond 
Alphandery (economy), and perhaps Francois Fillon (research). 
  Mr. Longuet wanted to give a pragmatic tone to bilateral 
relations, stating in particular that because of its remoteness, 
Vietnam could not form France's "backyard." He also stressed 
that because of the "colossal requirements" for restoring the 
country's infrastructures, there is room "for everybody" in a 
Vietnam which has two main advantages, the "will to succeed" and 
a "large and active" population.

  [Text] 3. Build a Uniform Market Mechanism Under State 
Management and in Accordance With Socialist Orientations. 
  Continued efforts must be made to build a new economic 
structure, bearing in mind the need to persist in the transition 
to the market mechanism while at the same time increasing the 
efficiency of state management. Steps must be taken to perfect 
apparatuses and policies to create necessary conditions for the 
market mechanism to operate effectively. It is necessary to 
guarantee the right of autonomy of businessmen. Prices should 
be set mainly by the market. Market indicators are very 
important factors for allocating resources to production and 
business establishments. It is important to adopt incentive 
measures to encourage everyone to compete in a legitimate and 
wholesome manner. Steps must be taken to limit monopoly. 
Business people have the right to earn profits in a legitimate 
way. The state only sets the prices of a small number of goods 
and services bearing a particularly important socioeconomic 
significance or having a highly exclusive nature. In any case, 
prices must all be set within the limits of the market 
mechanism. It is necessary to stabilize transporation costs and 
the prices of electricity, water, fuel, and oil. Steps must be 
taken to eliminate the system of providing subsidies for losses. 
It is important to regulate income distribution in a rational 
way and create conditions for expanding production facilities 
and for reducing waste of resources. It is necessary to abide by 
the principle of positive [laix duwowng] interests, closely 
monitor the rates of inflation, and create favorable conditions 
for both savings and loans. It is important to regulate 
currency exchange rates in a satisfactory manner, bearing in 
mind the need to see to it that the actual rates remain 
relatively stable but not rigid and henceforth, help promote 
exports and control imports. Plans must be worked out to 
determine fees and wages in a rational manner. It is necessary 
to formulate a selective subsidy policy for agricultural and 
export products. Appropriate measures must be taken to protect 
local products and the interests of both producers and 
consumers. Uniform steps must be taken to form various types of 
markets, products, services, labor resources, capital, 
technology, real estate, and so forth. 
  It is necessary to step up state macro-management to direct 
and guide the overall performance of the national economy. 
Efforts must be made to create an economic environment and 
legal boundaries for production and business activities. 
Measures must be taken to develop positive factors, prevent or 
contain the adverse impact of spontaneous or negative actions, 
and overcome the inherent shortcomings of the market mechanism. 
Henceforth, these will cause the latter to become a really 
important instrument for distributing and making better use of 
all sources of strength as well as for distributing or 
redistributing the national income to guarantee equilibrium 
between revenue and spending, regulating the interests of the 
various economic sectors and people of all walks of life, 
meeting the growing demands of development, and ensuring social 
justice. 
  The state macro-management system must cover all areas of 
the 
national economy and economic sectors instead of the state 
business sector only. It is necessary to strengthen the 
concentration and uniformity of government agencies when it 
comes to exercising macroeconomic management. At the same, it 
is necessary to increase the responsibilities and power of 
sectors and localities in case they can work out better 
solutions to the various problems involved. 
  It is necessary to guarantee the right to autonomy of 
business establishments. Special ministerial agencies should 
devote efforts to carry out their functions as development 
project planners for economic and technological sectors under 
their charge satisfactorily. They should also provide 
direction, assistance, and supervision for operations of 
business establishments belonging to different economic sectors 
and in different areas of activity as specified under their 
state management functions. It is important to strengthen the 
role of interministerial agencies in overseeing the overall 
performance of all sectors and areas of operations, thus putting 
all socioeconomic activities under the state's effective 
macro-management system. 
  Administrative organs at all levels should perform their 
state management functions in areas under their charge by 
overseeing the operations of business establishments belonging 
to different economic sectors, bearing in mind the need not to 
distinguish between central and local economic organizations. 
  Steps must be taken to perfect the legal system to ensure 
strict observance of rules and regulations. Efforts must be 
made to consolidate and strengthen the advisory role of planning 
agencies so the latter can formulate good plans and projects to 
serve development goals, calculate and maintain a balanced 
macro-management system, adjust investment structures, effect 
economic restructuring, and serve as a venue for coordinating 
efforts to tap all sources of strength at home and abroad and 
make effective use of them to realize socioeconomic development 
goals. 
  We must continue to reform the financial and monetary 
system fundamentally and comprehensively, while satisfactorily 
promoting economic activities to increase investment and 
development. We must strive to ensure uniform management of the 
national financial system, savings, and expenditure; improve 
financial work of the state, enterprises, and the population. 
Efforts should be made to improve budget management at the 
central and local levels to ensure sufficient allotments for 
normal expenditure, investment development, and national 
defense. We must mobilize capital at home and abroad, strive to 
meet immediate requirements, practice thrift, and promote 
investment development for long-term interest. 
  We must encourage state-run enterprises to carry out 
autonomous financial management under close supervision and 
control by the state. 
  We must strive to keep the budget deficit at lower than five 
percent of the GDP, make great efforts to increase state revenue 
to pay for expenditure, refrain from issuing banknotes to 
resolve the budget deficit, and strive to balance income and 
expenditure. Efforts must be made to reform the accounting 
system and improve auditing at the state and private sectors. 
  The central state bank must formulate and implement the 
monetary policy to ensure effective allotment, transfer, and 
remittance of money; curb inflation; coordinate with financial, 
trade, and price agencies to maintain average annual price 
increase to single digits only; strive to balance international 
debt while increasing foreign currency reserves. The financial 
and banking sectors must satisfactorily carry out their 
functions of establishing funds, and effectively use and provide 
credits, and strive to meet requirements for economic 
development. This is to maintain their role as a center for the 
settlement and circulation of money within society. They must 
strive to improve the foreign currency management mechanism to 
create conditions for the Vietnamese dong to be effectively 
circulated and for it to become the sole currency for the 
settlement of debt nationwide. 
  4. Measures to resolve cultural and social issues: 
  Our party and state's guiding thought in carrying out the 
cultural and social work is to care for, foster, and develop the 
human factor to create a driving force for revolutionary 
objectives. Efforts must be made to resolve various current 
issues to ensure social justice, enhance the people's intellect, 
promote a healthy atmosphere in society, and protect and develop 
our national cultural traits. To effectively create sufficient 
jobs for workers, the state and people must save money for 
investment development while satisfactorily implementing the 
socioeconomic strategy. They must encourage all economic 
components, citizens, and investors at home and abroad to expand 
branches and occupations to create more jobs for the laborers 
and reduce the number of unemployed workers, expand foreign 
trade, and promote the export of laborers. Efforts must be made 
to organize vocational training for youths to enhance their 
professional skills. For personnel and workers laid off by 
administrative agencies and economic units, we must reorganize 
and provide them with vocational training as well as loans to 
help them become involved in production and business or to find 
other jobs for them, while striving to set up consultative 
agencies to introduce new jobs. 
  We must formulate laws to protect the legitimate interests 
of 
both employees and employers at private capitalist business 
establishments. The laws on labor, wages, insurance, and taxes 
have been and will be promulgated in accordance with investment 
promotion, the elimination of social injustice, and opposition 
against illegal businesses. The statutes, regulations, and 
disciplines for workers formulated by business establishments 
must not stand against state laws. 
  It is necessary to say that the economic growth rate should 
be in parallel with social progress and justice at each stage of 
development. Social justice should cover areas such as the 
distribution of the means of production, income in accordance 
with results in production, and equal opportunity for each 
member of the production force to develop his ability. We must 
implement the principle of distributing more income to those who 
work and contribute more and vice versa, while striving to 
oppose mediocrity, and a dependence on others. We must ensure 
income is distributed in accordance with labor. We must 
encourage and treat competent and capable workers appropriately, 
and ensure a fair income for investment projects especially in 
production and business. We should encourage the people to 
amass wealth through honest means, while fighting poverty and 
hunger, motivate the rich to participate in economic 
development; formulate policies to rationally promote credit, 
taxation, vocational training to create conditions for the poor 
to be able to progress and to earn enough and become rich. 
Various former wealthy areas should, together with the state, 
assist the poor and underdeveloped areas. We must mobilize rich 
people to contribute in helping the poor by providing loans, 
equipment, and materials and in the transfer of experience and 
working methods. We should set up funds to repay those who have 
rendered meritorious services to the state, formulate 
appropriate policies for the rich, mobilize business enterprises 
and private organizations to participate in humanitarian and 
charitable activities to help the victims of war and natural 
calamities as well as the disabled, the aged, and the homeless 
who can no longer work. 
  The responsibility of each citizen in solving their own 
individual and family problems should be heightened. At the 
same time, the common sharing of responsibilities in society in 
general should be intensified to develop our people's 
humanitarian tradition. 
  The goals and measures set forth in the seventh party 
Central 
Committee Fourth Plenum Resolution on education and training, 
culture, the arts, public health care, and population and family 
planning work must be continued so that in a few years 
significant achievements can be recorded in our education 
service, thereby helping the education service fulfill its role 
in upgrading the people's mental abilities, creating the 
people's labor force, and improving the people's skills. 
  At first, compulsory elementary education must be 
implemented. And, if possible, universal secondary education 
should be introduced in some localities. Policies to exempt and 
reduce school fees and provide suitable financial assistance 
must be applied to guarantee the education of children from poor 
families, especially those living in isolated, high, and former 
revolutionary base areas. 
  Existing ethnic boarding schools must be consolidated and 
more boarding schools must be built. We must reorganize the 
vocational training system, upgrade the service provided by 
teachers' colleges, and rearrange the tertiary education system 
by linking academic training with vocational skills, study with 
practice, and training and research with production. 
  National university centers must be built with improved 
goals, curriculums, and education methods to meet national 
development requirements. Planning for fostering and retraining 
the contingent of teachers must be established, policies to 
grant appropriate rewards to teachers must be introduced, and 
the state management of the education and training service must 
be strengthened.

<F P=106> ["Last part" of political report delivered by Do Muoi at </F>
Midterm National Party Conference in Hanoi on 20 January -- read 
by announcer] 
  [Text] We must continue to thoroughly understand 
conceptions and implement lines and measures set forth by the 
party third plenum. We must concentrate on political and 
ideological work to ensure the political and ideological unity 
in the entire party. Cadres and party members must be given 
regular training on the party's conceptions and lines to upgrade 
their knowledge, confirm their commitment in the socialist path, 
and help them to creatively apply and develop the 
Maxist-Lenininsm, Ho Chi Minh thought, and advanced ideas of our 
times and grasp new thinkings to correctly resolve problems 
arising from real situations. 
  The ideological work must first must concentrate on pressing 
problems that need to be dealt with quickly. Through practical 
research and review, problems arising from the renovation 
process together with measures to solve them must be 
scientifically clarified. Mistaken conceptions and vague and 
unsure ideologies must be corrected. We must fight against all 
opportunistic, rightist, dogmatic, and conservative 
manifestations. 
  Party cadres and members must strictly observe the party's 
resolutions and directives and state laws. They must not 
disseminate conceptions contradicting the party's line. 
  Party unity and unification must be strengthened. Principles 
relating to party organization and activity -- first, the 
principle of democratic centralism and the principle of 
collective leadership and individual responsibility -- must be 
implemented. Revolutionary morality and healthy lifestyles must 
be drilled to fight against waste, corruption, and illegal 
business. We must fight against personalism, indiscipline, 
arbitrariness, authoritarianism, parochialism, and clannishness. 
  The party protection work and the work to ensure internal 
and 
national secrecy must be given particular attention. All 
conspiracies and tricks to degenerate the party cadres must be 
eliminated. The control work on the implementation of the 
party's lines, policies, and regulations must be strengthened. 
  The national unity block must be broadened, and the close 
relationship between the party and the public must be 
consolidated. Uncle Ho's thoughts must be promulgated to broadly 
unite all Vietnamese people in supporting the renovation cause 
for national independence and in striving to extricate ourselves 
from poverty and backwardness to surge forward for the goal of 
rich population, strong nation, and just and civilized society. 
  We must consider national interests as a common goal. At the 
same time, we accept different viewpoints as long as they do not 
counter the national interests. We should eliminate obsession 
of hatred to look forward to the future. The ideology of great 
unity must be manifested in all state guidances, policies, and 
laws. 
  We must perfect policies to guarantee the interests and 
roles 
of the workers, peasants, and intelligent. The forces of women 
and youth must be fostered and developed. The party and state's 
policies regarding the ethnic and religious people, 
industrialists, businessmen, overseas Vietnamese community must 
be supplemented and satisfactorily implemented. 
  The party echelons and party committees must hold study 
workshops before implementing party Central Committee and 
Political Bureau resolutions on the work relating to fatherland 
fronts and mass organizations. We have to set up mechanisms to 
coordinate activities between state organs and mass 
organizations. The work content, method, and attitude of the 
fatherland fronts and mass organizations must be revamped. 
  We have to reform cadre-related work. First we have to renew 
our conceptions and methods of our cadre-related work in 
assessing, selecting, employing, and deploying, especially key 
cadres. Gifted people must be trained, fostered, and employed. 
We have to create favorable conditions for good people, both 
inside and outside the party and inside and outside the country, 
to contribute their best efforts to the nation. 
  The contingent of cadres must be rejuvenated. Woman and 
ethnic cadres must be given special attention. We must fight 
against narrow-mindedness, parochialism, prejudice, and 
discrimination. The evaluation, choice, and assigning of 
leading cadres at all levels must base on fundamental standards 
outlined in the Third Central Committee Plenum resolution. We 
must pay particular attention to their political knowledge, 
determination in the party's goals and ideals, and morality and 
life style to ensure that they always exercise diligence, 
practice frugality, instill honesty, and uphold righteousness. 
They must not be corrupted and determined in fighting against 
corruption. They must have consciousness of organization and 
discipline, stay close to the masses, and obtain a capacity and 
quality in par with their duties. 
  We will bring about democratization of party member work. 
The evaluation of cadres must be done collectively by the party 
committee directly managing the cadres together with relevant 
agencies and must be done in accordance with proper process in a 
democratic, conscientious, and fair manner. Every cadre has the 
right to be informed and to give opinion on the evaluation by 
the party committee and agency leaders on the concerned cadre. 
  All party organizations will reorganize and reevaluate the 
existing contingent of cadres, and base on this evaluation to 
build up plans for party member work from mow until the year 
2000, which will correspond to the requirements of quantity, 
quality, and structure of cadres. 
  We will provide training and further training to cadres 
according to plans. The training content must be specific for 
each task and requirements of each concerned position. 
Renovation must be carried out in both teaching and studying 
methods in training, while adequate funds must be provided to 
the training provision. Party members, especially the cadres at 
all levels, must regularly study, enrich their knowledge, 
heighten their understanding level, and improve their 
revolutionary characteristics. 
  We have to urgently prepare the human force for the eighth 
party congress and the later years. We have to improve the 
policies and awards for cadres, renovate our thinking, heighten 
the scientific characteristic of the organization task, and 
continue to overhaul the organization system to guarantee a 
light and effective party mechanism with high efficiency. 
  We have to boost the research on organization models, 
discern 
each function, duty, and leadership style of the party at all 
sectors and echelons, and from there set up plans to perfect the 
organization and rationalize the mechanisms of the party, state, 
and other organizations. 
  We will renovate the party's leadership model. Our party is 
a 
ruling party, which sets up policies and lines for the national 
construction and protection. The successful implementation of 
party's policies and lines requires us to grasp firmly the 
organization and cadre work. The party leads applying the 
democratic centralism principle, and the principle of collective 
leadership with individual responsibility. The leadership task 
is fulfilled through the party organization, not through the 
individual party cadre. The leader executes collective 
decisions, follows up and guides the implementation, encourages 
good deeds, corrects deviations to develop the role and efficacy 
of the state, not to replace it. 
  We must heighten militant character of the party members 
contingent regarding consolidation of grass-roots party 
organizations. At present, the political determination and 
loyalty to the party's ideals, to working people's interests and 
interests of the people as a whole, are essential 
characteristics of a party member. The party regulations 
clearly stipulate the criteria and duties of a party member, and 
every member must abide by these regulations, be a model in 
striving to become an excellent worker, cadre, or manager, who 
fulfills all assigned tasks, studies regularly to improve 
knowledge and work ability, respects organization disciplines, 
fosters party unity, and strictly follows state laws. 
  We have to handle in a timely and strict manner those 
degenerated and deviated party members, and those breaching 
party disciplines and state laws. We continue to expel from our 
party those who do not have membership eligibility any more. We 
must perform well the party development task, especially among 
youth and women and in organizations where grass-roots party 
organizations do not exist or have too few members. 
  We will rejuvenate the party contingent. On the occasions of 
the party's 65th founding anniversary and other important 
festivities in 1994, we will launch education and training 
campaigns on party development with prime attention be focused 
on youth, in preparation for the eighth party congress. 
  In front of us is a new era full of promising potentials, 
challenges that we determine to overcome, and favorable 
opportunities we must exploit. All of our party, army, and 
people must stick together, be unified in the struggle to 
successfully implement the resolution of the Seventh Party 
Congress and bring the renovation undertaking forward with ever 
greater victories.

conference worked with a high sense of urgency, taking into 
account and evaluating the socioeconomic achievements that we 
have scored since the seventh party congress. Their evaluation 
results were modest and accurate. The delegates also contributed 
additional views on the dangers, challenges, and key tasks that 
our entire party, people, and army will have to face in the days

leading the party-initiated renovation undertaking to final 
victory.

  [Text] Hanoi, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Vietnamese Defense Minister 
Doan Khue urged the army to end corruption in its units, a 
"priority" task for 1994, the army daily QUAN DOI NHAN DAN 
reported Tuesday. 
  "The army must take more active measures...to struggle 
against corruption and smuggling in its ranks," the daily said, 
adding that the measures were a "limited" success in 1993. 
About 100 corruption and smuggling cases were adjudicated by 
the army, of which 20 were decided by military tribunals, it 
said. The corruption cases concerned military vehicles used to 
transport smuggled goods and the diversion of funds or 
materials, the QUAN DOI NHAN DAN said. 
  Several members of the communist party serving in the army 
were sanctioned last year due to their direct or indirect 
participation in corruption and smuggling, the newspaper said. 
It put the value of goods recovered by the army at several 
hundred thousand dollars. 
  A senior military official, General Nguyen Truong Xuan, was 
sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment in 1987 for his role in 
trafficking in the northern port of Haiphong. 
  Corruption is increasingly affecting the institutions 
charged 
with defending the stability of the government -- the police 
and, to a lesser extent, the army -- at a time when Vietnam is 
working towards a market economy. The monthly wage of an 
officer varies between 300,000 and 700,000 dong (30-to-70 US 
dollars). The Vietnamese army has about one million men, 
according to official estimates.

  [Text] To satisfactorily carry out the socioeconomic 
development tasks -- particularly in the areas of industry, 
commerce, tourism, and agriculture -- set forth by the capital, 
Hanoi, for the next remaining two years under its 5-year plan, 
the Hanoi banking sector has held a conference to review its 
reform activities over the past three years. 
  In attendence were Comrade Pham The Duyet, member of the 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Hanoi Municipal Party 
Committee; Comrade Cao Sy Kiem, member of the party Central 
Committee and governor of the Vietnam State Bank; and 
representatives of over 30 banks now operating in Hanoi. 
  By using various means of mobilizing capital in 1993, the 
banks in Hanoi acquired a total capital which was 39.7 percent 
of the country's total. The total amount of money they had lent 
out as of the end of 1993 amounted to 13,878 billion dong, 
accounting for 58.3 percent of the country's total loans and 
representing a 10-fold increase over those in 1991 and 1992. 
Banks in Hanoi have expanded their credit operations in various 
economic components. In particular, their medium- and long-term 
loans offered to various business firms to carry out technical 
innovation during 1993 increased 13 fold over 1992. The cash 
shortage situation is over. Formerly, it took eight days to 
resolve a banking transaction, but now it takes only one day. 
Banks have made active contributions to the economic growth of 
Hanoi.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- Foreign publications 
expressed positive support to the principled stand of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea towards the nuclear issue 
of the Korean peninsula. 
  The January issue of the Peruvian paper VIDA EMPRESARIAL in 
an article headlined "DPRK Calls For General and Complete 
Nuclear Disarmament" pointed out that the alleged nuclear 
development and nuclear issue of North Korea were invented by 
the United States and the South Korean authorities in a bid to 
isolate and stifle the socialist system of Korea, leaving the 
U.S. troops and nuclear weapons in South Korea intact. 
  Pressure or international sanctions have no effect, the 
paper 
said, stressing "Nuclear Issue of the Korean Peninsula Should Be 
Solved Through the DPRK-U.S. Talks." Count-down, a mouthpiece 
of the Japanese society of the participants in the international 
solidarity march movement for supporting Korea's reunification, 
said the only way of resolving the nuclear issue involving the 
possibility to plunge the Korean peninsula into the horrors of 
war is to make the DPRK-U.S. talks successful. The key to it 
is the solution in a package deal proposed by the DPRK, said the 
paper. 
  The Vietnamese paper PEOPLE'S ARMY January 12 said the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is a delicate problem 
affecting the peace and stability of Asia and the rest of the 
world. It called for an impartial solution to the issue.

Chondoism, proposing a working-level contact between 
representatives of Chondoists of the North and the South to 
discuss the joint celebration of the centenary of the peasants' 
war in 1894. 
  The message said that the joint celebration by the North and 
the South of the anniversary of the war waged under the slogan 
"Reject the West and Japan" and "Promote national interests and 
welfare of the people" would be of weighty significance in 
opposing outside forces and their lackeys, promoting national 
harmony and unity and accomplishing the noble cause of 
reunification in the '90s, inheriting the spirit of national 
independence and the patriotic spirit displayed by Chondoists 
and other participants in the war. The message said three 
delegates led by Han Yong-su, vice-chairman of the Central 
Guidance Committee of the KCA, would be sent to the conference 
room of the neutral nations supervisory commission at Panmunjom 
at 10:00 on February 3 to discuss the matter with the South side.

<F P=106> ["Anti-Communist War Hysterics Precipitates </F>
Self-Destruction" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
puppets, clamouring about "possibility of military provocation" 
and "arms buildup" by the North, on January 21 cried for "the 
establishment of a posture of prompt regular warfare" and 
"perfection of the all-out security posture of civilian, 
government and army" to cope with them. 
  Branding this as a deliberate move to incite hostile 
feelings 
against and confrontation with the North and aggravate the 
North-South relations, a MINJU CHOSON analyst says: 
  It is the South Korean puppets who are aggravating the 
North-South relations and rendering the situation on the Korean 
peninsula tense. 
  Entering this year, the Kim Yong-sam group has staged war 
exercises against the North almost every day and is crying that 
in case the "Team Spirit" joint manouevres are suspended, it 
would hold an integrated war game of "Ulchi" and "Focus Lens" on 
a larger scale with the United States. 
  The puppets are these days zealously resorting to 
North-South 
confrontation and anti-communist war racket. This is their 
desperate attempt to get out of the serious crisis. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group, driven to an acute crisis in less 
than one year after its seizure of power, seeks to divert 
elsewhere the attention of the people by a more acute 
North-South confrontation and frantic anti-communist war racket 
and keep its power at whatever cost in reliance upon outside 
forces. 
  North-South confrontation and war adventure, however, cannot 
be a way out of the crisis. It is as foolish as jumping from 
the frying pan into the fire.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- World public 
denounces the crimes committed by Kim Yong-sam in establishing a 
military fascist rule under the "civilian" veil. 
  The International Committee of Jurists for Democracy and 
Human Rights in South Korea in a statement charged that after 
seating himself in the "presidential" chair, Kim Yong-sam has 
refused to dismantle the "Security Planning Board," a 
suppressive machine, and kept the fascist laws including the 
"National Security Law." 
  Television No. 2 of France said that the present South 
Korean "regime", under the mask of "civilian politics," 
continues repressing the people as under the military fascist 
rule. 
  The Cuban magazine BOHEMIA said: 
  "The South Korean people demanded that Kim Yong-sam restore 
democracy, end the fascist rule, clean up all manner of 
corruption and fling open the door of reunification. But he 
refused to do so and he is not a man fit for such things". 
  The Rwandan Committee for Supporting the Reunification of 
Korea in a statement said the South Korean authorities showed 
that the present government under the "civilian" veil was a 
military fascist "regime" when they let loose the repressive 
force and blocked the fourth pan-national rally. 
  A delegate of the International Association Against Torture 
demanded that the South Korean authorities immediately scrap the 
"National Security Law" and unconditionally release the innocent 
people.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- The Central 
Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the 
Fatherland on January 23 published a statement condemning the 
South Korean authorities for blocking the visit of the mourners' 
group of the North side to South Korea to mourn the death of the 
Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a patriotic champion of reunification, at his 
bier. 
  By blocking the South Korean visit of our mourners' group 
under an unreasonable pretext the South Korean rulers revealed 
themselves as the truculent fascist dictators, human scums and 
unprecedented barbarians who took off "civilian" veil, bereft of 
elementary human morality and etiquette, the statement said, and 
went on: 
  "The South Korean `regime', which is still branding the 
National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon) 
as an `organisation benefiting the enemy', invented by the 
military dictators of the `Sixth Republic' to suppress and 
stifle it, is little different from the preceding military 
fascist regimes, and, accordingly, it is clear to everyone that 
the fascist `regime' cannot be called a `civilian government'. 
  "Worse still, the South Korean authorities refused to accept 
our offer for mourning visit, a purely humanitarian and 
compatriotic issue, by linking it with the fictitious `nuclear 
problem'. This goes to prove that the `nuclear issue' 
loud-mouthed by them is a product of a sinister political 
purpose. 
  "The Kim Yong-sam group must act with discretion, well aware 
that angry voices condemning this anti-human and rude act are 
ringing out not only among the people of all strata, the 
opposition parties but among members of the `Democratic Liberal 
Party' of South Korea."

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- The people of the 
northern half of Korea are bitterly condemning the inhuman act 
of the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique in blocking the Seoul trip 
of a mourners' group of the North for Rev. Mun Ik-hwan. 
  The director of the Kim Chong-tae General Electric 
Locomotive 
Works, Pak Su-pom, branded the act of the Kim Yong-sam clique as 
an inhuman act of fascist hooligans who take no account of the 
beautiful manners and customs handed down through generations 
and elementary civility and morality. 
  He said: 
  "The South Korean puppet clique mumbled about the `nuclear 
issue' and `an organization profiting the enemy.' It is really a 
far-fetched argument and an expression of a vicious scheme to 
dampen the nation's fervor of reunification, delay the country's 
reunification and finally break off the ties of the nation". 
  He warned that a sledge-hammer blow will be dealt at the Kim 
Yong-sam clique, the enemy with whom our nation cannot live 
under the same sky. 
  Yi Song-pong, chief pastor of the Pongsu Church, Pyongyang, 
said: 
  "By not allowing delegates of the North to go to Seoul to 
mourn the deceased, the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique stripped 
themselves bare as a group of barbarians ignoring human 
morality." 
  He said Rev. Mun Ik-hwan was a patriotic champion of 
reunification who devotedly struggled for the reunification of 
the country and democratization of society in South Korea for 
many years. He pointed out that the "civilian" signboard hung 
out by the Kim Yong-sam clique was false and it was a group of 
traitors who did not want national reconciliation and 
reunification. 
  "I join the religious men in declaring to the world that the 
Kim Yong-sam fascist clique is a group of truculent, despicable 
traitors who must no longer be left in this world where only 
love, harmony and trust must prevail and, on this land of our 
nation," he added.

<F P=106> ["South Korean Authorities Denounced for Blocking Seoul Trip </F>
of Mourners' Group of North Side" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- "Barring the North 
side from mourning the death of the late Mun Ik-hwan at his 
bier, a pastor who devoted himself to the patriotic movement for 
reunification, calling the National Alliance for the Country's 
Reunification (Pomminnyon) an `organisation benefiting the 
enemy', is a base act that can be done only by hoodlums ignorant 
of morality and politics." 
  The North side headquarters of Pomminnyon said this in a 
statement Monday denouncing the South Korean authorities for 
blocking the southern trip of the North side's mourning group 
for the late Rev. Mun Ik-hwan, a pro-reunification patriot. 
The statement brands this act as an intolerable insult to the 
North side headquarters of Pomminnyon and all those concerned 
with Pomminnyon and compatriots at home and abroad and one more 
political persecution of the deceased who devoted his all to the 
patriotic movement for reunification of Pomminnyon. 
  It further says: 
  "The Rev. Mun Ik-hwan was a leading figure of the movement 
for democracy and reunification who, from the first days of the 
Pomminnyon-led movement, fought for the founding of an 
organisation of Pomminnyon and its legalisation in South Korea, 
braving all manner of persecution and suppression. 
  "To regard Pomminnyon as an `organisation benefiting the 
enemy' is, in the final analysis, to regard the whole nation as 
an enemy, and is a criminal act that can be done only by those 
who are opposed to the unity of the nation and reunification. 
  "By blocking the Seoul trip of our mourners' group the Kim 
Yong-sam group made it plain that `national reconciliation' and 
`divorce from the military dictatorship' declared by it so often 
are lies and that it is a group of traitors and 
anti-reunification elements outdistancing the preceding military 
dictators." 
  Noting that today all the fellow countrymen in the North, 
the 
South and overseas are turning out as one in the struggle to 
achieve reunification in the 90s by united efforts of the nation 
at any cost, the statement stresses the need to immediately cut 
out the cancerous being swimming against this trend of the 
nation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- A general meeting of 
the Central Committee of the North side headquarters of the 
National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon) 
was held in Pyongyang today. 
  Discussed at the meeting was the task of the Central 
Committee of the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon for 
making this year a year of great national unity. 
  Paek In-chun, chairman of the North side headquarters, 
recalled in his report that the great leader President Kim 
Il-song in his New Year address set before all the compatriots 
in the North, the South and overseas the task to unite under the 
banner of great unity of the whole nation and accelerate the 
cause of national reunification through a nationwide struggle. 
  He stated that the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon, 
side by side with the Pomminnyon organisations in South Korea 
and overseas, will wage a vigorous struggle for the achievement 
of great national unity, highly assessing the proposal of the 
overseas headquarters of Pomminnyon to set this year as a year 
of great national unity for national reunification and launch a 
powerful movement for this unity as an entirely just and timely 
initiative. 
  The present situation urgently demands Pomminnyon smash the 
separatists' acts of confrontation against reunification and 
create a favorable climate for reunification in the 1990s, the 
reporter said, proposing measures to that end. 
  He called for vigorously waging the movement for great 
national unity in hearty response to "10-point programme of the 
great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the 
country," a great political charter of national unity, so as to 
pave the way for national reunification this year. 
  The report was followed by speeches. 
  A resolution was adopted at the meeting.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Slams Outburst of Japanese Defence Agency </F>
Advisor" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang January 24 (KCNA) -- The former chairman 
of the Joint Staff Council of the Japanese "Self-Defence Forces" 
[SDF] and now advisor to the Defence Agency, Sakuma, in his 
lecture in Tokyo recently, let loose a string of bellicose 
outpourings, blabbing that the SDF officers should be given 
"bigger voice and influence" in the present government and Japan 
and South Korea, as the parties concerned, cannot sit idle" in 
an event of contingency on the Korean peninsula. 
  Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today says: 
  Sakuma, a professional SDF officer, let out the bellicose 
blast as soon as he took office as an advisor to the SDF. This 
is a very ill-boding act. This indicates that the Japanese 
military quarters, having built up strength for turning Japan 
into a military power, are now going to embark upon the road of 
reinvasion, exerting a direct influence even on the state power. 
  His utterances show how frenziedly the war-thirsty military 
quarters are trying to proceed overseas by destroying the 
domestic device of legal control. 
  Sakuma disclosed the scheme to create a legal condition for 
a 
war of aggression when he rattled on "revision of the SDF law" 
and "study and enactment of a law on the case of emergency." 
Should the arbitrariness of the military be allowed and given 
greater scope in Japan with a record of aggression behind her, 
it will, no doubt, follow in the footsteps of the Japanese 
imperialists. 
  Korea is the first target of reinvasion of the Japanese 
reactionaries. Sakuma's claim that Japan, together with South 
Korea, "is a party concerned in a possible Korean war" cannot be 
construed otherwise than an outcry of Japan threatening a war in 
Korea. 
  The war-hungry military quarters of Japan should ponder over 
the matter, not making a mistake as regards the DPRK.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
authorities will reportedly "assure the Asian countries that 
Japan will never become a military power" and "do its utmost to 
win their trust" at the ASEAN Security Forum to be held in 
Bangkok in July this year. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today says Japan's bid to 
get the trust of the Asian nations is as ridiculous as a wolf 
imitating the voice of the sheep. 
  The analyst says: 
  Asian nations heavily suffered from the Japanese 
imperialists' aggression and occupation in the past, which left 
deep scars on the hearts of their peoples. This is the cause of 
their distrust in and caution against Japan. Their distrust and 
caution are growing with the revival of militarism in Japan and 
its moves to become a military power. The Asian peoples have 
been told by top Japanese authorities more than once that Japan 
would not be a military power. Japan, however, has escalated 
arms buildup for the purpose of becoming a military power. 
  Japan's moves to become a military power is chiefly aimed at 
realising with strength the design of "the greater east Asia 
coprosperity sphere" it failed to fulfil in the past. 
  Japan's promise not to be a military power is a crafty ruse 
to launch a military aggression by blunting the vigilance of the 
Asian peoples. 
  If Japan truly wants to get their trust, it must actually 
demonstrate its will of peace. 
  It must, first of all, slash military expenditures, cut back 
armament, cancel overseas dispatch of troops and give up the 
nuclear armament program. It must also fully liquidate its past 
crimes and honestly discharge its obligation to make an apology 
and compensation. 
  If Japan's promise to refrain from becoming a military power 
is true, it must show it in practice.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Lambastes Japanese Authorities' Scheme To </F>
Sidestep Liquidation of Past" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries a commentary titled "Empty Talk About `Apology' Is 
Unnecessary" accusing the Japanese authorities of persistently 
trying to sidestep the liquidation of Japan's past crimes. 
  After taking office, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa stated 
more than once that Japan "repents" of and "apologizes" for its 
past crimes and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata declared recently 
that Japan would "always keep in mind its repentance of the 
past," the analyst says, and continues: 
  The Japanese authorities, however, have failed to present a 
concrete solution commensurate with the apology and have kept 
mum about compensation, the keypoint of the liquidation of the 
past crimes. 
  This bespeaks that they have no willingness to honestly 
resolve the question of liquidation of the past crimes but 
intend to hush it up with the empty talk about "repentance." 
  "Apology" without a solution is not apology and the 
liquidation of the past without compensation is unthinkable. If 
Japan is willing to properly liquidate its past doings, it must 
make an adequate material compensation together with honest 
apology. 
  Any apology and compensation would not be enough for the 
unheard- of crimes and heavy losses imposed by the Japanese 
imperialists upon Korea and other Asian nations after illegally 
occupying them in the past. 
  With nothing can their past crimes be covered up, still less 
is it impossible to dismiss the liquidation of the crimes only 
with the word of "apology." [sentence as received] The Japanese 
authorities would be well advised to properly liquidate the past 
crimes, instead of resorting to petty tricks.

  [Text] On 20 January, a meeting was held at the DPRK 
Embassy in Russia to explain Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year's 
address. 
  Invited there were (Vasiliy Stratuchev), member of the 
council of the Russian Federation; (Nikolay Aritonov), member 
of the Russian State Committee and vice chairman of the Russian 
Agricultural Party; (Aleksandr Nadrechev), member of the State 
Committee and chairman of its Agricultural Affairs Committee; 
(Viktor Zorkaltzev), member of the State Committee, chairman of 
the Regional Organization Affairs Committee of the Socialist 
Association of the State Committee, and vice chairman of the 
Central Executive Committee of the Russian Federation Communist 
Party; (Viktor Ilyushin), member of the State Committee and 
chairman of the Security Committee of the State Committee; 
(Kostantin Nikolayev), first vice chairman of the Political 
Executive Committee of the Soviet Communist Party Council of the 
Communist Party League; (Nikolay Latukin), vice chairman of the 
Russian Agricultural Party; (Aleksandr Lapin), secretary of the 
All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party Central Committee; (Vladimir 
Kusev), secretary of the Russian Communist Workers Party Central 
Committee; (Vladimir Markov), secretary of the Russian Communist 
League; (Andrey Yevreskiy), first secretary of All-Union Lenin 
Komsomol Central Committee; (Nikolay Visin), president of 
(?Palria) Publishing Company; and other relevant functionaries 
of the political parties, organizations, and publications and 
press, including the Russian Free Trade Union. Son Song-pil, 
our country's ambassador to Russia, and functionaries of the 
embassy attended the meeting. 
  Ambassador Son Song-pil spoke. Referring in detail to the 
basic contents of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New 
Year's address, he pointed out: Last year, our people won a 
brilliant victory in socialist construction and demonstrated the 
might of chuche Korea to the world despite the harsh trials the 
imperialists and reactionaries viciously subjected them to 
through their anti-Republic maneuvers. This was a result of the 
outstanding and tested leadership of the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. This 
year, too, our party and people will unite as one around the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il and thoroughly implement an independent, self-reliant, 
and self-defensive revolutionary line. As a result, they will 
further strengthen the political, economic, and military might 
of the country and positively struggle to achieve national 
reunification through a way of a confederal system based on one 
nation, one state, two systems, and two governments. 
  Pointing out that our party and the Government of the 
Republic will consistently carry out an independent, peaceful, 
and goodwill foreign policy in the future, too, he continued: 
Today our people's struggle is arduous, but the Korean people, 
who are struggling for the just cause under the wise leadership 
of the great leader [suryong] and the great leader [chidoja], 
are ever victorious. The maneuvers of the imperialists and the 
reactionaries, who want to isolate and crush [apsal] the DPRK 
under the pretext of the non- existent nuclear development, will 
not avoid their own destruction. 
  Participants in the meeting congratulated our people on 
their 
brilliant achievements made in socialist construction last year 
and sincerely wished them a greater success in their future 
works under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.

Piety'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- Foreign visitors to 
Korea speak highly of the feats and personality of the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  Mady Ndao who had visited Korea in the capacity of special 
envoy of the Senegalese president said he keenly felt that His 
Excellency Kim Chong-il is the greatest thinker and theoretician 
of the present era and ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant 
commander with literary and military accomplishments. 
  "His Excellency Kim Chong-il has steadily developed and 
enriched the immortal chuche idea and strengthened and developed 
the Korean People's Army into steel-like Armed Forces that can 
defeat any aggressors at one blow," he noted. 
  Alhaji Adam Bukhari Ziblim, general secretary of the 
National 
Convention Party of Ghana, had this to say: 
  "The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great man 
possessed of courage, tested organising ability and iron will. 
I am struck with admiration at his precious feats and 
energetic guidance in strengthening the Korean People's Army 
into matchless ranks and building many monumental edifices. 
  "The looks of the Korean people who are marching forward in 
soaring spirits, full of confidence in victory, convinced me 
that no one on earth is a match for this people." 
  Toyohide Araki who led a delegation of the Japan Society for 
the Study of Kimilsongism is quoted as saying: 
  "Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great man of the great men 
with both literary and military accomplishments. 
  "The world is unstinting in praising him for humbling the 
U.S. imperialists." 
  P. Mabiti, an MP of Tanzania, said he was struck with wonder 
at the phenomenal development of Korea. 
  "The proud achievements gained by Korea are all a shining 
fruition of the independent politics of the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song and the tested, veteran leadership of the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il with literary and military 
accomplishments and loyalty and filial piety, who is leading the 
revolutionary cause to victory with his matchless grit and 
rock-firm faith," he stressed.

  "Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il is an illustrious leader who 
enjoys unbounded respect and reverence not only from the Korean 
people but also from the revolutionary people of the world for 
his undying exploits and contributions for the times and mankind. 
  "It is the highest glory and happiness of the progressive 
people of the world as well as the Korean people to have dear 
Comrade Kim Chong-il as the sagacious leader. 
  "To grandly celebrate the birthday of the dear leader 
Comrade 
Kim Chong-il and extend warm congratulations to him is the

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Our Party's Formalization of the Great </F>
Leader's Revolutionary Ideology"] 
  [Text] Comrade Kim Chong-il has made a great achievement, 
which will become immortal in the world, by energetically 
conducting ideological and theoretical activities to inherit and 
develop the revolutionary ideology of the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song. The formalization of the revolutionary ideology of 
the respected and beloved great leader [suryong] by the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il occupies the most important position 
in his ideological and theoretical achievements gained in 
developing and evolving the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's 
revolutionary spirit. 
  Scientifically formalizing the leader's [suryong] 
revolutionary ideology is of basic significance in advancing the 
revolution and construction as intended by the leader [suryong] 
and in consummating the working class' revolutionary cause. 
  We can make the working class and popular masses cherish the 
immortal revolutionary banner to endlessly consummate the 
revolutionary cause only if we formalize the revolutionary 
ideology of the leader [suryong]. 
  The cause of formalizing the leader's revolutionary ideology 
cannot be easily achieved by anyone because it is regarded as a 
lawful requirement in the developing revolution, but it can be 
achieved by the leader's [suryong] successor, who is endless 
loyal to the leader and who has a far-sighted extraordinary 
wisdom and a scientific insight. 
  The historic cause to scientifically formalize the respected 
and beloved leader's revolutionary ideology was brilliantly 
carried out by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is the 
genius of ideology and theory and great leader [yongdoja] of the 
chuche cause. The dear comrade leader scientifically 
formalized and announced the leader's revolutionary ideology by 
reflecting the warm aspiration and unanimous desire of the 
people, who want to comply with the indispensable requirement 
for our party and the developing revolution and the 
revolutionary ideology of the great leader [suryong] in 
combination with the esteemed name of the leader [suryong]. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said that the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il brilliantly solved the question of 
comprehensively systematizing the principle of the chuche idea 
by energetically conducting the ideological and theoretical 
activities and he has taught: Based on his deep study of the 
basic principle and essential contents of the chuche idea, he 
has formalized our party's guiding ideology as a monolithic 
system of theory and method of chuche idea. 
  As formalized by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the 
revolutionary ideology of the great leader is a system of the 
theory and method of the chuche idea. In other words, it is a 
monolithic system of the chuche idea, as well as the system of 
the revolution and construction based on embodiment of the idea. 
  The scientific formalization of the great leader's 
revolutionary ideology by the dear comrade leader is a 
significant event in effecting an upturn in the development of 
our party and the revolution and in our people's ideological and 
spiritual lives. It is also a historic declaration that 
announced the respected and beloved leader's [suryong] 
revolutionary spirit as the highest stage of the development of 
the working class' revolutionary ideology. This, indeed, 
becomes an immortal achievement contributed to the development 
of ideology of mankind and to the consummation of the 
revolutionary cause of the working class. 
  Thanks to the formalization of the revolutionary ideology of 
the respected and beloved leader by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, his revolutionary ideology has been a great guiding 
ideology for the revolution and construction in our times, the 
chuche era. As a result, its historic truth has been disclosed. 
  One of the basic characteristics of the revolutionary 
spirit of the great leader [suryong] lies on the fact that it is 
a system of ideology and theory -- the essence of the great 
chuche idea -- which was founded for the first time in the 
ideological history of mankind. 
  The great leader's revolutionary ideology -- the essence of 
the chuche idea -- indicates that all of its contents has been 
developed and systemized based on the theory and method of the 
chuche idea. 
  The revolutionary ideology of the leading working class 
regards dialectical and historical materialism as a basis for 
the outlook of the world. The world consists of materials based 
on the revolutionary ideology of the leading working class. The 
world is based on a principle of dialectical materialism, which 
means that it is constantly being changed and developed by the 
material movement, as well as on a principle of historical 
materialism that applies to the history of society. 
  The primitive philosophy of the working class greatly 
contributed to overcoming the mystery, subjectivity, and 
fatalism on the question of mankind's fate, but could not handle 
the question of mankind's fate because its direct mission is to 
reveal the essence of the objective world and the lawfulness of 
the development of its movement. 
  The question of the fate of the working popular masses is 
raised profoundly for the first time by the chuche idea as a 
question of the outlook of the world. The chuche idea has 
solved all problems of the outlook of the world centering on 
mankind, the working popular masses, as well as an outlook of 
the world which its direct mission is to contribute to pioneer 
the fate of the working popular masses. 
  The chuche idea has developed the essence of the world based 
on mankind. Also, it has expounded the lawfulness of the global 
change and development in combination with mankind. As a 
result, it has clearly presented ways to pioneer the fate of 
mankind, of the working popular masses. 
  As stated, the chuche idea fully elucidates all problems of 
the outlook of the world centering on mankind and is the most 
scientific and revolutionary outlook of the world centering on 
mankind. The progressiveness and historic system of socialist 
ideology can be determined on how much it can correctly 
elucidate a way for the pioneer of the fate of the popular 
masses. 
  The great leader's revolutionary ideology -- the essence of 
the chuche idea -- is one that elucidates most correctly the way 
for the pioneer of the working popular masses' fate. Because of 
this, it has entered the highest stage of development of the 
working class' revolutionary ideology. Therefore, it becomes a 
great guiding ideology for the revolution and construction in 
our times, the chuche era. 
  Also, the basic characteristics of the great leader's 
revolutionary ideology lies in the fact that it has a completed 
compositional system of the idea, theory, and method of chuche. 
Because the great leader's revolutionary ideology has the 
compositional system of the idea, theory, and method of chuche, 
its historic position, as the highest peak of the development of 
the working class' revolutionary ideology, exists, thus giving a 
perfect solution to all theoretical and practical problems in 
the revolution and construction in the chuche era. 
  The compositional system of Marxism includes philosophy, 
political economics, and scientific socialism. The historic 
mission of Marxism is to prepare the working class for the 
revolution and to improve the labor movement based on scientific 
foundation. To fully carry out this mission, therefore, Marxism 
had to abolish [tapa] religion, idealism, and metaphysics, but 
instead establish a materialistic and dialectical outlook of the 
world. Also, it had to scientifically disclose the secrecy of 
the exploitation by capitalism; had to explain the origination 
and the development of the capitalist economy and the lawfulness 
of the collapse of capitalism; and had to elucidate the 
inevitability of the victory of the socialist revolution. 
  After then, Marxism consisted of three major systems of 
dialectical and historical materialism, and socialism of 
political economics and science. Marxism, which is a theory 
formulated at a time when the working class entered the stage of 
history waging a struggle against capitalism, greatly 
contributed to clearing up the exploiting class and system and 
achieving a class liberation for the popular masses. However, 
as the times change and history develops, Marxism also could not 
avoid historical limits. 
  Unlike the previous revolutionary ideologies of the working 
class, the constituting systems of the great leader's 
revolutionary ideology are ideology, theory, and methods. The 
great leader's revolutionary ideology had the unique 
constituting systems because the great ideology is related with 
the sacred historic mission of the times and revolution. 
  Our times consists of a new historical era--the chuche 
era--in which the working popular masses, who were once 
exploited and oppressed, emerge as the master of history, 
independently and creatively carving out their own destiny. 
Revolutionary implementation of our times demanded that the 
revolutionary ideology of the working class consist of guiding 
ideology which gives ideology, theory, and methods. 
  For the working popular masses to independently and 
creatively carve out their destiny as the master of the world, 
they should be given chuche-based opinion and view of the world 
and the self-consciousness of their position and role, correctly 
be taught with the inevitability, strategy, and tactics of the 
birth and development of revolutionary struggle for 
independence, as well as the methods to accomplish their 
responsibility and role as the master of revolution and 
construction. 
  Based on such a demand of our times, the chuche era, the 
great leader's revolutionary ideology was constituted with the 
systems of chuche ideology, chuche revolutionary theory, and 
chuche leadership methods. 
  By constituting the three major systems of ideology, theory, 
and methods, the revolutionary ideology of the great leader 
gives the working popular masses a great view of the world, and 
a powerful ideological and mental weapon for them to 
independently and creatively carve out their own destiny as the 
master of the world. It not only thoroughly clears the way for 
the struggle to achieve the historic cause of national, class, 
and human liberation, and nature, society, human remodeling, and 
completely achieve independence, but also teaches the leadership 
methods for the popular masses to maintain their position and 
accomplish the role as the master of revolution and construction. 
  The revolutionary ideology of the great leader has three 
major constituting systems of ideology, theory, and methods so 
that it gives perfect answers to all theoretical and 
implementation problems arising from the struggle for 
independence in our times. Here lies the historic value of the 
revolutionary ideology of the great leader as the leadership 
ideology, theory, and methods representing the chuche era. 
  The revolutionary ideology of the great leader is formalized 
by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il so as to add luster to 
the revolutionary ideology of the great leader as a great 
leadership ideology of our times, the chuche era, and to give 
the working popular masses an immortal revolutionary banner to 
complete the socialist and communist cause. 
  Following the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, our people will complete to the end the socialist 
cause and chuche-oriented revolutionary cause by upholding the 
banner of the revolutionary ideology of the great leader.

<F P=106> ["Way Out Is To Rebuild Socialism" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- However desperately 
the imperialists and reactionaries may try, they can neither 
dampen the aspiration of people for socialism nor turn back the 
trend of times, declares NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article 
today. 
  The article says: 
  All manner of contradictions peculiar to the capitalist 
system give rise to chaos and crisis in politics, the economy, 
ideology and morality in those countries where capitalism has 
been revived. 
  Such catastrophic situation in those countries is entirely 
attributable to the reactionary nature of socio-economic reforms 
that have brought the revival of capitalism. 
  Hence, the quicker the process of reform, the more serious 
crisis and chaos. 
  The only way out of the crisis in the countries where 
capitalism has been revived is to rebuild socialism. 
  Socialism is incomparably superior to capitalism. 
  Capitalism is an anti-popular society where exploitation of 
man by man prevails and a tiny handful of exploiting class lord 
it over, a corrupt society based on extreme egoism. 
  But, socialism is a genuine society for the people where the 
popular masses are masters of everything and everything serves 
them, a superior society based on collectivism. 
  If the basic principles of socialist construction had been 
maintained and the advantages of the socialist system brought 
into full play, frustration of socialism and revival of 
capitalism would not have taken place at all in some countries. 
  Grudge against the revival of capitalism is swelling up and 
aspiration for socialism growing strong among the people in 
those countries who have realised it through bitter experiences. 
  The imperialists and reactionaries are making every 
conceivable effort to check the revival of socialism. 
  This is a move to block the social progress of those 
countries and put the peoples of those countries under the 
permanent yoke of domination and subordination.

<F P=106> ["Destiny of Motherland and Nation, Destiny of All Koreans </F>
at Home and Abroad" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
in a signed article quotes the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
as saying in his New Year address: 
  "The destiny of our motherland is immediately the destiny of 
our nation, as well as the destiny of our compatriots at home 
and abroad." 
  This teaching serves as a highly important guideline 
elucidating the ground and necessity for the entire compatriots 
in the North and the South and overseas to launch a nation-wide 
struggle for national reunification, rallied under the banner of 
the great unity of the whole nation, the article notes, and goes 
on: 
  The destiny of our motherland is immediately the destiny of 
our nation, as well as the destiny of the entire nation, because 
the independence of the country and the nation is a prerequisite 
to realizing the independence of the popular masses and the 
struggle for the independence of the country and the nation is 
immediately the struggle for independence of the popular masses. 
  As the life of everybody, a member of the nation, belongs to 
the life of the country and the nation, the independence of the 
country and the nation makes it possible to realize the 
independence of individuals. 
  The popular masses can successfuly carve out their destiny 
in 
conformity with their desire and demand only when the 
independence of the country and the nation is realized. 
  Independence of South Korea and the independent 
reunification 
of the country, this is the way for the complete realization of 
national independence in our country. 
  The destiny of our nation is closely linked with national 
reunification. 
  The reunification of our country is not a matter of ideology 
and system but a matter of national character as the matter of 
putting an end to the domination and interference of outside 
forces, completely realizing the sovereignty of the Korean 
nation and achieving national unity. 
  The entire compatriots at home and abroad should unite with 
one will to defend the independence of the country and the 
nation with their lives, linking their destiny with the destiny 
of the motherland and the nation. 
  Our fellow countrymen, who have lived for over 5,000 years 
as 
a homogeneous nation with tan gun as its father, are able to 
build a united state of the whole nation by means of 
confederation that can promote coexistence and co-prosperity, 
leaving the present two systems and two governments in the North 
and the South intact if they pool their wisdom and strength, 
giving precedence to national ideal. 
  The entire compatriots in the North and the South and abroad 
should unite as one, transcending the differences of idea and 
ideal, political views and religious belief under the banner of 
the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation 
and vigorously struggle to found a united state of the whole 
nation by means of confederation.

<F P=106> ["WPK Is Great Party With Iron Will and Tested Leadership </F>
Ability" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- The Workers' Party 
of Korea [WPK] led by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a 
great party with iron will and tested leadership ability, 
stresses NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today. 
  The article quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as 
saying: 
  "Our party is an invincible revolutionary party, which has 
performed immortal feats in accomplishing the revolutionary 
cause of chuche, enjoys unquestioned trust of the popular 
masses, is united as steel-like ranks and is possessed of rich 
experience and tested veteran leadership ability." 
  It further says: 
  The iron will and tested leadership ability of our party is 
clearly displayed first of all in confidently leading our people 
along the road of socialism, upholding the revolutionary banner 
of the chuche idea under any circumstances. 
  It is a steadfast faith and will of our party to carry the 
socialist cause to completion, holding aloft the banner of the 
chuche idea, neither hesitating nor taking a step back, whatever 
complicated situation may be created and whatever trial we may 
face. Drawing a proper lesson from the collapse of socialism in 
some countries and decisively refuting the abuses hurled by 
riffraffs at socialism, our party is vigorously advancing toward 
a bright future by displaying wisdom and bravery in turning 
misfortune into bliss. It has developed and completed the 
socialist idea of chuche and firmly armed the popular masses 
with it and strengthened the driving force of the revolution, 
the integral whole of the leader, the party and the masses, to 
resolve all the problems arising in the revolution and 
construction with its strength. 
  The iron will and tested leadership ability of our party in 
leading the socialist cause of our era to victory is also highly 
displayed in firmly defending the dignity of the country and the 
gains of the revolution, boldly meeting the challenge of the 
imperialists and reactionaries. 
  Last year, the moves of the imperialists and reactionaries 
to 
isolate, stifle and crush our Republic got more vicious than 
ever before, which carried the situation in our country to the 
extreme pitch of strain. When a touch-and-go situation was 
created in which a war might break out any moment, Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, our supreme commander, took a decisive step of 
declaring a semi-war state to the whole country, all the people 
and the entire Army and called upon all the people to meet the 
challenge of the enemy in the revolutionary spirit and militant 
stamina as was displayed in the grim fatherland liberation war. 
Thanks to this principled and resolute struggle of the party, 
our people and the officers and men of the People's Army could 
boldly meet the challenge of the enemy and smash his aggressive 
moves and honorably defend the dignity and security of the 
socialist motherland. 
  The iron will and tested leadership ability of our party is 
also displayed in vigorously leading the revolution and 
construction to a constant upswing with grand aspirations and 
ideal and without slightest stagnation and standstill. 
  It is our party's steadfast stand to continue the revolution 
till imperialism will have been wiped out and the victorious 
flag of socialism will be flying higher on this land. Hence, 
our party is pushing ahead with the three revolutions, 
ideological, technical and cultural, keeping a tight hold on 
them, and is firmly defending the revolutionary principle, the 
principle of socialism, under whatever circumstances. 
  Unprecedented miracles are being wrought and innovations 
effected and grand monumental creations adding lustre to the era

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- Korean fishermen are 
reporting remarkable achievements in fishing. 
  According to data available at the State Fisheries 
Commission, the January plan for aquatic products was fulfilled 
at 115 percent, of which fishes at 178 percent, on the 23rd of 
January. 
  In this period, the South Hamgyong Provincial General Bureau 
of Fisheries topped its fishing plan for the first half of the 
year and the General Bureau of Pelagic Fishing its first 
quarterly target. 
  The fisheries stations caught 40 to 50 tons of fish, 70 tons 
at maximum, per net by nimbly occupying the central fishing 
ground and applying advanced fishing methods.

  [Text] Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- A new ceramic art 
more simple and effective than the old technique has been 
developed in Korea. 
  So far a mixture of four to six kinds of raw materials was 
baked at high temperature. But the new technique requires the 
baking of one kind of raw material at low temperature. The new 
method increases the kiln efficiency two or three fold. 
  In the past it took 12 to 14 hours to get powder of mixed 
materials, while the new technique requires less than eight 
hours. 
  The new method is favorable for transport because it relies 
on the raw material rich in different parts of the country. It 
also saves fuel, electricity and manpower considerably. 
  The porcelainware made by the new method is light, solid and 
low in absorption rate. When used as a building material, its 
life span is considerably lengthened. 
  The method has been developed by teachers and researchers of 
the geological department of Kim Il-song University and 
technicians of the Taesong ceramic factory.

  [Text] With Japan-U.S. summit talks set to be held on 11 
February, Japan and the Untied States are holding working-level 
meetings on the three priority sectors of auto parts, insurance, 
and government procurement, and Japan-U.S. vice ministerial 
talks will begin in Washington to discuss ways for the two 
countries to reach final agreements. 
  Japanese Government officials in charge of the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks predict that Japan's stimulus measures, 
tax cuts, and the microeconomic area will be at the top of the 
agenda for the summit talks, but they do not hide their 
embarrassment at the present situation wherein political turmoil 
makes it impossible to set a specific schedule for the 
compilation of a budget for fiscal 1994. 
  The question is whether the government will be able to 
compile the budget before the summit talks. U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Bentsen, who arrived in Japan on 23 January, asked the 
Japanese Government to "take vigorous and continued fiscal 
measures" and other senior U.S. Government officials echo his 
view. If the House of Representatives were resolved and general 
elections held, the compilation of the budget for fiscal year 
1994 would undoubtedly be deferred until after the summit talks. 
Many government officials are in favor of putting off the summit 
talks, saying, "The summit talks, even if held, would be 
meaningless," (says a senior official in the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry). 
  An analysis by the same senior official in the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] says that if the Finance 
Ministry manages to work out an internal draft budget bill after 
averting the worst situation where the House of Representatives 
is dissolved and generation elections called, it is highly 
possible that the summit talks will be held as planned. The same 
senior MITI official predicts that even if the Hosokawa 
government remains incapacitated, the U.S. Government has a 
"mythological view" of Prime Minister Hosokawa and the U.S. 
Government is not expected to refuse to hold the summit talks." 
  Treasury Secretary Bentsen, however, pressed Japan for 
agreements at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, 
asserting, "If the agreements are inadequate, it is better not 
to hold the summit talks, and the United States will seek to 
review the basis for the bilateral economic framework talks." It 
is hard for the Hosokawa government to reach bold agreements 
with the U.S. Government that could weaken its power base. 
Hence, the Hosokawa government will have limited options, (says 
a senior official in the Foreign Ministry). The government 
officials in charge of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
are increasingly feeling a sense of crisis concerning the 
Hosokawa government.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Shigeru Gomako] </F>
  [Text] With Japan reeling from political upheaval, the 
prospect of "fruitful agreements" in Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks has become slim, and this development has led 
the U.S. Government to get tough with Japan. As measures to deal 
with Japan in case the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks end 
in failure, the U.S. Government has begun to study the 
possibility of using a presidential order to revive the Super 
301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act and of setting its 
own criteria to measure the openness of the Japanese market. The 
U.S. Government is believed to be employing the tactic to wring 
trade concessions from Japan for the time being. "Five schemes" 
are now under study by the U.S. Government and a NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN correspondent has examined how realistic these schemes 
are. 
  The rejection of a package of political reform bills in the 
House of Councilors disappointed the U.S. Government beyond 
imagination. A White House official said, "Prime Minister 
Hosokawa did not specifically explain to Treasury Secretary 
Bentsen about the income tax reduction" and expressed his 
disappointment at the lack of prospects for Japan's stimulus 
measures which have been viewed as a trump card to make the 
February Japan-U.S. summit talks a success. 
  At a plenary session of the vice ministerial economic 
framework talks that began on 24 January, the U.S. side took a 
"tough attitude again" for setting an objective criteria, about 
which the U.S. side has recently taken a flexible attitude, 
(says a Japanese Government source). Treasury Secretary Bentsen 
has publicly spoken of the need to "reexamine the bilateral 
economic framework talks," and his statement has been regarded 
as an expression of toughness in the U.S. attitude. One of the 
schemes under study by the U.S. Government is to revive the 
Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. It is highly 
possible the U.S. Government will decide to revive it if and 
when the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks fail to produce any 
results or are broken off. The second scheme is for the United 
States to "set its own criteria to monitor the openness of the 
Japanese market." These two schemes would create a mechanism 
whereby the United States monitors and declares sanctions as it 
likes. 
  A plan is under study by the U.S. Government to send U.S. 
Trade Representative Kantor to Japan in early February with the 
mission of presenting Japan with the two schemes and feeling out 
Japan's attitude toward them. The third scheme is an 
ultra-hard-line one whereby the United States expresses its 
unhappiness with the deadlock in the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks by notifying Japan of its decision to postpone 
the planned Japan-U.S. summit talks. The White House, however, 
is cautious about the third scheme. 
  The remaining two schemes are long-term in nature. One of 
the 
two schemes is to trigger again the "yen's appreciation" as 
occurred in the first half of 1993 with the aim of forcing Japan 
to take measures to stimulate its economy. Some officials in the 
Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the Treasury Department are 
opposed to this scheme and the possibility of its actually being 
put into effect is slim. The last scheme is for the United 
States to "keep Japan in check by bypassing it in strengthening 
its relations with South Korea, the Southeast Asian nations, and 
China." It is highly possible that the Untied States will adopt 
this scheme. 
  Needless to say, the United States will only use these 
schemes as a bargaining tool to wring trade concessions from 
Japan for the time being. However, it is true that the patience 
of the United States, which has decided to "refrain from taking 
tough steps against Japan until after the prime minister carries 
out the political reform," is wearing thin.

  [Text] Regarding the issue of dumping radioactive waste 
into the sea by Russia, the Japanese Government agreed in 
principle to provide the Russian Government with a 10,000-ton 
class secondhand tanker to be used as an emergency waste 
storage. Japan will spend 1 to 1.5 billion yen for this 
purpose. At a specialists' meeting held in Moscow, Japan 
presented the name of a tanker, which can be used as a storage 
facility. It seems that a sales contract will be signed with 
the owner of the ship as early as mid-January after Russia 
completes its studies. 
  The ship in question is a chemical tanker of Panamanian 
registry. Russian specialists will soon inspect the tanker which 
is anchored at a harbor in Singapore prior to signing a contract. 
  Currently, there are storage facilities in the Russian Far 
East and about 1,900 tons of liquid radioactive waste can be 
stored there. However, they are almost full and very old. 
  Saying "the environment in the Far East region is in a 
critical situation," Russia has asked Japan to provide it with a 
secondhand tanker with 5,000 to 20,000 tons of storage capacity 
by utilizing the $100 million support fund designed for the 
former Soviet Union for dismantling nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Russo-Japanese relations, which at one time were 
expected to improve in the wake of President Yeltsin's October 
visit, are coming to a standstill. That is because the 
political situation in Russia has become unstable due to the 
ultranationalists' victory in the Russian parliamentary 
election. In addition, it is inevitable that the president's 
"reform line" will face a difficult situation in wake of the 
resignation by Yegor Gaydar, first deputy prime minister, who is 
in charge of President Yeltsin's economic policies. A top 
Foreign Ministry official disclosed the prospect that the first 
meeting of a working group for a peace treaty will be delayed 
from its originally scheduled January date to sometime in 
February. Formation of the working group was agreed upon during 
a meeting between Hosokawa and Yeltsin last October. 
Consequently, it appears unlikely that Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata will visit Moscow in the first half of the year as planned. 
The visit was partly intended to lay the groundwork for Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's trip to Moscow in the future. 
  Following Russia-U.S. summit talks, Hata and his 
counterparts 
from the seven major developed countries (G-7) announced on 14 
January a plan to continue supporting the Russian economy. 
However, while it is difficult to improve the northern 
territorial issue, some government officials are beginning to 
say that the "atmosphere of the G-7 is quite different from that 
of last spring, and they are tired of giving financial aid to 
Russia," (according to a Foreign Ministry source). It is 
expected that some countries may start to call for a review of 
their aid to Russia. 
  Among other things, President Yeltsin, when he visited Japan 
last October, apologized to people detained in Siberia and 
admitted to the validity of various documents signed between 
Japan and the Soviet Union, including the 1956 Japan-USSR Joint 
Declaration. He displayed a diplomacy that could be called the 
first step toward establishing "normal relations," (according to 
a senior Foreign Ministry official). Immediately after the 
visit, however, it was revealed that Russia had been dumping 
radioactive waste materials into the Sea of Japan. Although the 
Japanese Government is trying, in a positive manner, to prevent 
waste dumping from happening again, many government officials 
are saying: "Fundamentally, this is an issue Russia has to 
solve by itself." 
  A factor that is making Russo-Japanese relations more 
unstable is the victory of the Liberal Democratic Party, led by 
extreme nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Regarding the 
territorial issue, the Japanese Government explained its stance 
of ignoring Zhirinovskiy's remarks, who said that "the territory 
will never be returned to Japan." But, the internal condition 
of the government is not calm. Some Foreign Ministry officials 
are beginning to think that "President Yeltsin may try to delay 
settlement of the territorial issue by taking advantage of 
Zhirinovskiy's remarks and behavior."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The People's Understanding Needed for </F>
Government Loans to China"] 
  [Text] "It is questionable that the government should 
continue to extend a huge amount of financial aid to China, 
which enjoys an annual growth rate of over 10 percent, when 
there is a recession in Japan." "There is a possibility that 
Japan's provision of aid to China will run counter to the 
principle of the Official Development Assistance [ODA]." We 
often hear such doubtful voices every time the issue of Japan's 
fourth yen-dominated loans to China comes to the surface. 
  The total amount of Japan's financial contributions to China 
through yen-dominated loans has reached over Y1.39 trillion in 
the 15 years from fiscal 1979 to fiscal 1993. Of this, Japan, 
in its third yen loan to China, which began in fiscal 1990, is 
scheduled to extend approximately Y810 billion in six years. As 
of fiscal 1993, a little over Y528 billion has already been 
extended to China in total. 
  In preparation for the fourth yen loan program, which will 
begin in fiscal year 1996, Japan hopes to decide on the total 
amount of loans by the fall of this year. Although Japan is 
facing a serious financial situation, we have no objection to 
Japan's continuous provision of loans if the amount and purposes 
of the loans are reasonable. 
  However, there is a possibility that future yen loans will 
not meet the changing needs of the times. We hope that this 
issue will be discussed at various places and levels so that the 
government will be able to win the people's understanding of and 
support for its financial aid. 
  First, the government is required to give the people a 
satisfactory explanation concerning the total amount of 
financial contributions. For example, Japan's financial aid to 
East Asian nations is increasing. It seems that Japan's aid to 
Vietnam and the Philippines, in particular, will further 
increase in the future. Given such a situation, it may not be as 
easy for the government to increase its aid to China as in the 
past. 
  Foreign Minister Hata, who visited China last week, in a 
series of talks with Chinese leaders agreed in principle to set 
a three-year period for the fourth yen loans instead of the 
usual five- to six-year period. Although the reason given for 
setting up a three-year period is that such a period will enable 
Japan to respond flexibly to situational changes, what lies 
behind this plan is the government's concern that "if the 
established loan period is six years, the total loan amount 
would reach over one trillion yen. Therefore, provisions for 
such a huge amount may invite the people's criticism." But in 
providing loans, the government needs to promote thorough 
discussion. 
  From now on, before extending loans, the government has to 
be 
careful in choosing projects, particularly in coastal provinces, 
which now enjoy rapid economic growth. It is stipulated in the 
ODA plan that yen loans should be provided to areas or regions 
where annual per capita income is less than $2,695, and grant 
aid should be extended to areas or regions where annual per 
capita income is less than $1,305. The average income of the 
Chinese people is still low. But in some areas of the coastal 
provinces, the average annual income may exceed the financial 
conditions noted above for yen loans. 
  However, it is hoped that financial aid to poverty-stricken 
inland areas will increase. It is also suggested that Japan 
will drastically increase its grand aid aimed at promoting 
agricultural development. Moreover, we believe that Japan's aid 
aimed at helping China promote the market economy will also be 
effective. 
  Meanwhile, the Japanese Government should watch over China's 
increase in its military expenditures, development of missiles 
and other weapons of mass destruction, and exports and imports 
of arms. In talks with General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Foreign 
Minister Hata succeeded in having Jiang Zemin comment that 
"(China's increase in military expenditures) is only for 
purposes of defense, not expansion." In the future, Japan 
should urge China to come up with concrete measures -- including 
advance notice of military exercises and disclosure of 
information on military arrangements -- so that China's military 
affairs will be more transparent.

  [Text] Mexico City, 18 Jan -- Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. will 
build an auto parts design and develop center in Mexico. The 
company intends to begin construction of the center in March, 
with the aim of completing construction this year. The 
investment amount is approximately 2 billion yen. Nissan plans 
to gather at the center about 500 employees in charge of parts 
design, purchase, and quality control who are now doing business 
in various places within the country in order to make it a base 
for providing design and development assistance to about 170 
local parts manufacturers with which Nissan has dealings in 
Mexico. With an eye on the yen's appreciation and the 
effectuation of the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA], 
Nissan intends to further increase local production of parts and 
to strengthen the competitive power of Nissan cars made in 
Mexico. 
  Nissan will build the center in Toluca, approximately 50 
kilometers west of Mexico City. The center will be constructed 
on a 90,000-square-meter site adjoining a foundry of Mexico 
Nissan (headquartered in Mexico City, with Masao Horie as 
representative), Nissan's local production corporate in the 
country. In addition to those in charge of parts purchase and 
quality control, the company intends to transfer to the center 
310 people in charge of design who are now doing business at 
various plants. 
  The company intends to open the center, which will be 
equipped with design rooms and various test facilities, to all 
manufacturers dealing with Nissan -- such as local corporations 
of Nissan-affiliated parts manufacturers as well as 
locally-capitalized parts manufacturers. Both Nissan and parts 
manufacturers plan to discuss which parts should be produced in 
Mexico, and to make efforts to shorten the term for developing 
parts for exclusive use in locally produced cars. By stopping 
parts imports from Japan and beginning local production, Nissan 
intends to establish a procurement system that will not be 
affected by fluctuations in exchange rates. 
  With the effectuation of NAFTA, foreign manufacturers doing 
business in North America have been forced to further raise the 
local procurement rate of parts to increase dealings within the 
NAFTA region. The local procurement rate of parts, which is a 
condition for exempting finished cars from duties in the NAFTA 
region, will be 50 percent for four years starting this year, 56 
percent for four years starting in 1998, and 62.5 percent after 
2002. 
  Although presently Nissan reportedly clears the first 
condition of 50 percent, for the time being it has no intention 
of exporting finished cars from Mexico to the United States and 
Canada. However, there is a possibility the company will begin 
dividing production at its plants within North America. The 
company intends to further promote local production of parts in 
Mexico in an effort to attain the local procurement rate under 
the NAFTA calculation system and to maintain its competitive 
power in the price war. 
  Nissan is now producing finished "Sunny" and "AD Van" [name 
as published] cars as well as engines for "Altima" cars in 
Mexico. Its plant and equipment investment in Mexico was more 
than 20 billion yen in 1993. In accordance with its plan to 
start production of the new "Sunny" car in February next year, 
Nissan intends to invest approximately 30 billion yen in 1994.

  [Text] As of 14 January, several foreign diplomatic 
sources in Tokyo revealed the emergence of a plan to form a 
Middle East-version of the CSCE, following recent progress in 
the Middle East peace talks. According to the sources, Middle 
East nations, such as Israel and Egypt, and nations concerned, 
such as Japan, the United States, and Russia, are to 
participate in the planned council -- which will be modeled 
after the CSCE -- to discuss security issues. Japan has shown a 
positive attitude toward this plan. Should it materialize, it 
would be an epoch-making event for the establishment of 
long-lasting peace in the Middle East. 
  The plan was taken up at a meeting of the Multilateral 
Negotiations Steering Committee [MNSC] on peace in the Middle 
East that was held in Tokyo last December. The participating 
nations agreed the plan is "a valuable second phase in the 
Middle East peace process," (as stated by a Foreign Ministry 
source,) and therefore it should be given due consideration. 
  Among the expected participants in the planned council are 
nations and organizations concerned, such as Israel, Egypt, 
Syria, Jordan, and the PLO, and major nations and organizations 
participating in the Middle East peace talks, such as Japan, the 
United States, and the European Union (EU). 
  The CSCE was officially established in November 1990 [year 
as 
published] when member nations signed the "Charter of Paris for 
a New Europe" to discuss security issues in Europe in the 
post-Cold War era. A total of 48 nations, including European 
and American nations, belong to the organization which, in 
addition to holding summit meetings once every two years, has 
made achievements in such aspects as the successful exchange of 
military information through setting up a center for preventing 
conflicts. 
  A working group on arms management under the MNSC is to hold 
a meeting in Qatar after April to discuss the specifics 
concerning the "Middle East-version CSCE" plan. However, the 
historical background of the Middle East nations is more 
complicated than that of Europe. For the time being, therefore, 
the plan calls for placing emphasis on "brewing trust" among the 
member nations -- a task that the CSCE has been successful at -- 
and building a "communications network" to prevent the 
accidental occurrence of emergency situations through such means 
as the exchange of information on military deployment and 
movements. 
  Japan has gained influence as the chairing nation for a 
working group on environmental issues under the MNSC. Thus, it 
would be expected to play a leading role, should the planned 
council be established. 
  However, for the plan to materialize, it is a prerequisite 
that a comprehensive peace be established in the Middle East. 
For example, the declaration on provisional Palestinian 
self-rule in Gaza Strip and Jericho must be completely 
fulfilled, and there must be progress in peace talks between 
Israel and Syria. Much public attention has been focused on the 
outcome of upcoming talks between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton set to be held in Geneva this 
month, as this is considered to hold the key to the 
materialization of the plan.

  [Text] Junji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Policy 
Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, who led a fact-finding team to 
former Yugoslavia, has said the dispatch of Japan's military 
observers to the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) deployed in 
Macedonia is "worth a study" and his remark is now causing a 
ripple within the government. So far, the government has 
persistently taken the view that it is difficult for Japan to 
cooperate with the UN Peaecekeeping Operations (PKO) in former 
Yugoslavia. The government has unequivocally explained that it 
has not sent the fact-finding team to study the possibility of 
dispatching Japan's military observers, (says a senior Foreign 
Ministry official). Raising questions about Mr. Yanai's real 
intentions, a top government official has said, "We need to pay 
attention to him." The same government official also has become 
cautious regarding the Foreign Ministry's "initiative." 
  Yasushi Akashi, special representative of the UN Secretary 
General, who is in charge of UN affairs in former Yugoslavia, 
has expressed the hope that Japan will send its military 
observers to the UNPROFOR in Macedonia since assuming his post. 
At a meeting with Mr. Yanai on 8 January, Mr. Akashi said, "I 
hope Japan will explore the possibility of cooperating with the 
UNPROFOR." 
  The UNPROFOR is a new form of the PKO which is being tested 
in Macedonia. The PKO Cooperation Law in Japan does not envision 
Japan's participation in the UNPROFOR and the Foreign Ministry 
has indicated it would be "difficult for Japan to dispatch its 
military observers to the UNPROFOR," (says a top government 
official). 
  The government is baffled by Mr. Yanai's remark in view of 
this background. Defense Agency Vice Minister Shigeru 
Hatakeyama told a news conference on 17 January that "I do not 
think that Japan can send the military observers to Macedonia 
under the present legal system." It is true, however, that 
complaints are rising within the Foreign Ministry that 
"political constraints are standing in the way of fully using 
the PKO Cooperation Law," (says a senior Foreign Ministry 
official). Many officials in the Foreign Ministry, which has 
promoted Japan's cooperation with the PKO with an eye on Japan's 
seat on the UN Security Council, think that discussion on 
whether to send the military observers to former Yugoslavia 
should be continued. Mr. Yanai's remark is taken as a reflection 
of that mood in the Foreign Ministry and as an attempt to create 
a stir in the government and among the people. 
  The same top government official revealed on 17 January his 
distrust in the Foreign Ministry's "way of handing things," 
citing the fact that the government's decision to "postpone" 
sending Self- Defense Forces personnel to Mozambique for the PKO 
was reversed after the Foreign Ministry's fact-finding team 
returned home. 
  It is certain that once a high-ranking Japanese Government 
official speaks of a "study," his remark leads the United 
Nations, European nations, and other nations concerned to pin 
high hopes on Japan. Administrative Vice Foreign Minister 
Kunihiko Saito has said, "Mr. Yanai's duties were not to make a 
judgment, but to undertake a survey." Hence, Mr. Yanai may come 
under criticism for making a rash remark.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "First Step Toward Transparent Tender System"] </F>
  [Text] The public distrust in biddings for public works 
projects is deepening following a series of bribery scandals 
involving general contractors. The United States, pointing out 
that construction bid rigging symbolizes the closure of the 
Japanese market, has pressured Japan to change the conventional 
tender system. 
  On 18 January, the cabinet announced an action program aimed 
at revamping the current tender system for the public works 
projects after endorsing it. That day, Obayashi Construction 
Company, a major general contractor, came under investigation 
and it can be said that the investigation indicates anew the 
need to revamp the current tender system for public works 
projects. 
  The action program, that has been worked out on the basis of 
Central Construction Deliberation Council recommendations, is a 
summary of ways for overhauling the current tender system and at 
the same time, an answer to the United States. 
  The action program's key point is that more than 4.5 million 
SDR (special drawing rights: approximately 700 million yen) 
worth of public works projects to be implemented directly by the 
central government and more than 15 million SDR (approximately 2 
billion yen) worth of public works projects to be implemented 
directly by government-invested organizations, and prefectural 
and municipal governments will be subject to an open competition 
tender system. 
  About 20 percent of the public works projects, whose orders 
are to be placed by the central government, will be open to 
foreign firms. The action program, that is in tune with 
international rules, has been accepted by the United States. 
  Although the action program will be applied to large-scale 
public works projects for the time being, the government has 
formally announced that it will adopt the open competition 
tender system next year. The announcement is a step forward. 
  The United States, which has set 20 January as a deadline 
for 
slapping sanctions on Japan unless Japan takes satisfactory 
measures to open its construction market, should now withdraw 
the planned sanctions against Japan. 
  Needless to say, the action program is no more than a 
framework to make biddings transparent and open the Japanese 
construction market. To make the reform effective, it is 
important for the central and local governments to work to 
operate the action program fairly and flesh it out. 
  A majority of the public works projects implemented by the 
central and local governments still remain subject to the 
conventional designated bid system and it is necessary to take 
actions to improve the system. 
  There is no need to point out that the construction 
community 
should drastically reform their consciousness to rid them of the 
traditional bid rigging structure. It is also indispensable to 
carry out political reform and urge bureaucrats to strictly 
restrain from getting jobs in construction, firms that they 
oversee. The Fair Trade Commission has the responsibility to 
rigorously enforce the Antimonopoly Law. 
  We hope that U.S. and other foreign firms will work to gain 
access to the Japanese construction market by fully using a new 
tender system. Free competition will serve to hold down the 
costs of Japan's public works projects that are higher than 
those in other nations. 
  U.S. firms, which are ahead of other foreign firms in such 
software as designing and consultants, are interested in gaining 
access to them. The action program makes it mandatory that the 
central government and public corporations planning to implement 
more than 450,000 SDR worth of public works projects, and local 
governments planning to implement more than 1.5 million SDR 
worth of public works projects, offer an opening tender for 
designs and consultants. 
  The number of orders for the designing and consultants will 
be very limited because in Japan, government offices in charge 
of placing the orders are staffed with many technocrats who are 
assigned to design and manage the public works projects. This 
phenomenon has forced the technocrats to seek free technical 
know-how from the private sector, thereby paving the way for 
them to forge a collusive relationship. 
  Now that the private sector has come to have better 
technology than the government has in many areas, the government 
should leave the software area to competition among firms. This 
is compatible with the administrative reform policy and will 
bring about the effect of adopting state-of-art technology for 
the public works projects. 
  Construction friction between Japan and the United States 
will undoubtedly recur unless the Construction Ministry 
transforms itself from the current business ministry into a 
policymaking ministry. The ministry should reform its function 
on its own, not by external pressure.

<F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 22 Jan 94 </F>
Morning Edition] 
  [Text] On 21 January, government agencies in Kasumigaseki 
were greatly shocked by the news that the political reform bills 
had been killed in the upper house. Bureaucrats were 
disappointed and felt uneasy about this incident on the eve of 
the compilation of the pump-priming package and the fiscal 1994 
budget. With the Japan-U.S. summit in February near at hand, (a 
senior official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] noted) 
"we do not know when and what kind of pump-priming package we 
can work out, and this will make the attitude of the United 
States unpredictable." While the Ministry of Finance [MOF] 
usually reacts coolly to developments in political circles, 
senior officials were busily engaged in information-gathering in 
the evening. 
  "What the deuce is going on?" Earlier in the day, senior MOF 
officials hurriedly called on the prime minister's office, and 
it appeared they were perplexed with the information that the 
bills were likely to be killed at the upper house. Immediately 
after television reported the upper house decision, top MOF 
officials gathered at Vice Minister Jiro Saito's office. They 
reportedly agreed to "watch development of the situation since 
the political scene is so uncertain." The MOF then started 
analyzing possible directions of the political scene. 
  MOFA and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] are concerned about possible delays in economic policies 
in preparation for the Japan-U.S. summit. MITI Vice Minister 
Hideaki Kumano said the incident is "no big deal," but he looked 
nervous. A senior MITI official said: "The prime minister 
cannot go to the United States if the government fails in 
hammering out the new pump-priming package. I am really worried 
about the direction of the tax system reform." 
  The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo held an emergency meeting in the 
evening, probably to study possible influences on Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's Tokyo visit. An embassy official said 
"we thought the possibility (of defeat of the bills) was 50-50." 
  As the coordinator of economic policies, the Economic 
Planning Agency is becoming tired of the "political agenda badly 
affecting our job" (as noted by a senior official). If the 
agency has to work out the pump-priming package before settling 
the tax reform issue, the package will inevitably be less 
effective. 
  The Labor, Health and Welfare, and Transportation ministries 
are all concerned the uncertainty of the political situation may 
delay the compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget, and this would 
affect their employment, welfare, and railroad construction 
policies. A senior Labor Ministry official said: "Taking the 
worsened employment rate into account, we are now in big 
trouble."

Article Type:CSO 

<F P=106> [Article by Masashi Kunimitsu: "Hosokawa Coalition </F>
Government Neither `Temporary' Nor `Two-Tiered'"] 
  [Text] The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], which has 
not become accustomed to its role as the opposition party, finds 
itself in a predicament where it uses the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ] in its former role as opposition party as 
a model. On the other hand, we would like to see the coalition 
parties become accustomed to their governing role quickly and 
fulfill their public pledges. 
  The coalition cabinet has enjoyed smooth sailing in its 
initial days. According to mass media public opinion surveys, 
support ratings for the Morihiro Hosokawa cabinet are running at 
the lowest level of 70 percent recorded by the NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN published in its morning edition of 24 August 1993, 
while others ranged above 75 percent, including a surprising 82 
percent by the SANKEI SHIMBUN. The highest rating in the past 
was the 62 percent immediately following the inauguration of the 
Kakuei Tanaka cabinet in 1972 in a survey by the ASAHI SHIMBUN. 
These ratings reflect the fact that a majority of the general 
public welcomes the collapse of "1955 system." 
  "Even in a questionnaire survey of bureaucrats in deputy 
department head and higher positions in central government 
agencies, conducted by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, 72 percent of the 
respondents welcomed the coalition government. The results of 
that survey clearly reflect discontent held against the former 
LDP government. When one views the reasons for the welcome such 
as "We can expect the implementation of new policies" and "We 
will be afforded the possibility of major policy options," one 
can visualize the rigidity that had set in because of the 
collusion between officials of the central government agencies 
and LDP zoku Diet members and the resulting discontent generated 
among middle and junior bureaucrats. During the past 20 years, 
no change whatsoever has been made in budgetary allocations 
concerning public works projects, welfare, and other areas. In 
summary, what this means is that even bureaucrats did not have 
freedom relative to policy options ever since the Tanaka cabinet 
or since control by Tanaka. This means that the LDP is indeed 
the organization that must undergo a thorough awakening and 
fundamental self-reform." 
  Seeing that the coalition parties appointed popular Prime 
Minister Hosokawa and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata to the most visible positions, the LDP attempted to 
regain public support by appointing Yohei Kono who enjoys 
national popularity as LDP president, Ryutaro Hashimoto as 
Policy Research Council chairman, Shintaro Ishihara as acting 
chairman of the newly created 21st Century Council (Hashimoto 
serves as chairman) and a two-term junior House of 
Representatives Diet member to the Executive Council. 
  "The fact that the LDP lost its majority status even in the 
House of Representatives when the Hata faction (current 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]) and Takemura group (current 
Sakigake [Harbinger]) seceded and was not able to regain its 
majority in the summer 1993 elections cannot be attributed 
solely to the lack of public popularity on the part of the then 
LDP president and prime minister, Kiichi Miyazawa. If it were a 
case where elections can be won by purely pushing candidates 
enjoying public popularity, why is it that the momentum of the 
Shinjiyu [New Liberal] Club petered out and eventually forced a 
disbandment and return to the LDP? Why is it that when Ishihara 
took over the former Nakagawa faction after the sudden death of 
the late Ichiro Nakagawa the faction failed to expand and 
eventually joined forces with the Fukuda faction (current 
Mitsuzuka faction)? Why is it that when Hashimoto became LDP 
secretary general and assumed overall leadership, the LDP lost 
the House of Councilors election and its majority ranking. It is 
a case where none of these circumstances was favorably 
influenced by the popularity of the principal role player." 
  The LDP is not being asked by the public to pursue policies 
aimed at running a popularity contest or temporizing. They seek 
a fundamental alteration of its diathesis. 
  "A `prominent leading political party' is not supposed to 
create an exaggerated brouhaha over a simple administrative 
error wherein administrative bureau employees of the House of 
Representatives misread the roll call and demand a repeat of 
house elections. If there should be an omission in the roll 
call, all that needs to be done is for the speaker to ask 
whether any ballot omissions exist and to correct any omissions. 
Further, such elementary roll calling systems which are subject 
to errors should be abolished and action should be taken to 
submit a resolution or bill to implement a push-button balloting 
system as once proposed by the LDP itself. The LDP is acting 
just like the Social Democratic Party of Japan did at one time 
in a manner which is a metamorphosis of the latter's ox-walk 
[delay] tactics. We can only view such conduct as signifying 
that the LDP believes the SDPJ was once the model for opposition 
parties." 
<H5>  Heckling Leads to Questioning of LDP Character </H5>
  "When nationwide attention was focused on Takako Doi's 
selection as the first female speaker of the House of 
Representatives and her acceptance speech, LDP Diet members 
heckled her in a very intolerable manner. Because, as expected, 
that situation was singled out for severe criticism by female 
LDP Diet members during their first talks with LDP President 
Kono and LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori, we anticipated that 
such conduct would not be repeated. However, when Prime Minister 
Hosokawa gave his general policy speech on 23 August, senseless 
heckling, which could be better described as angry outcries, 
almost drowned out the speech to the point where it was 
inaudible. That conduct made one believe that the LDP is 
convinced that savage behavior manifested in angry outcries, 
irrespective of substance, plays a constructive role in making 
the Diet a place of lively activity. There is no way that 
creatures who cannot listen attentively to others are qualified 
to represent the public." 
  Heckling is not an appropriate tactic in the Diet unless it 
is sharp, graceful, and humorous as well as "pithy, terse, and 
to the point." The late Takeyoshi Miki, who was called the 
"heckling general" in the prewar Diet, used heckling tactics 
that were typical of that standard. "Heckling tactics" used by 
current Diet members make one question their character. Reform 
of diathesis of this nature is required of today's LDP. 
  "Since general policy speeches will be broadcast live by the 
Japan Broadcasting Service, close-up shots of Diet members 
shouting senseless utterances should be broadcast along with 
full name and electoral district. We must do so because the LDP 
is not about to take corrective action, unless forced to do so 
under such exposure." 
  Considering that LDP politicians will not act unless under 
"external pressure," the public has no choice but to apply 
pressure externally to make the LDP take corrective action. 
  There is no doubt that the Hosokawa cabinet enjoys a very 
high degree of support, but only the future will tell whether it 
will be able to respond to such expectations. When the LDP and 
Communist Party engaged in representative questioning they 
asked, "What's different between what you've said and the words 
of the former LDP?" and "You lack specifics," but so-called 
criticism voiced with an ulterior motive should be disregarded 
and Hosokawa should endeavor to fulfill his convictions. 
  "The prime minister's first general policy speech was 
favorably received by the public. He clearly declared a change 
in era and launched anew a program for "responsible reform." 
Further, in connection with World War II, he recognized Japanese 
aggression and colonial control and apologized to the Asian 
people who suffered as a result. Germany took similar action 
immediately following defeat which means that Japan was late by 
about 50 years, but such a performance was something you 
obviously could not expect of the LDP. He also unequivocally 
pledged political reform within the year. The prime minister has 
stated that he will assume responsibility if that goal is not 
reached within the year. We must recognize that as a courageous 
stand." 
<H5>  General Policy Speech Worthy of Recognition </H5>
  The national image launched by the prime minister in the 
form 
of a goal to "create a simple and sincere nation encompassing a 
lifestyle rich in substance and abundant in cultural traits" is 
strongly reminiscent in terms of renewed memories of something 
long forgotten rather than nostalgic feelings for those who can 
recall the days when the theme of a "cultural nation" was overly 
stressed in the postwar era. You might say the prime minister's 
words reflect a very harsh criticism of the "1955 system" which 
was contaminated by the principle of almighty money under 
economic supremacy. 
  In connection with Japan's position relative to World War 
II, 
the prime minister has clearly determined it to be a war of 
aggression and honestly apologized to people of other nations 
who suffered damage and in his general-policy speech stated, "I 
once again express profound remorse and apology for the 
unbearable suffering and sorrow experienced by many people 
because of past acts of aggression and colonial control by our 
nation." Those Japanese officers and enlisted personnel who died 
during the war did not even dream of it as being a war of 
aggression, and more than just a few were convinced that they 
were fighting for the sake of emancipating the greater East 
Asian nations from imperialistic control of West European powers 
for the establishment of a coprosperity sphere while some 
members of surviving families of the dead probably sense 
inconsistency in the determination that it was a "war of 
aggression." However, mankind cannot demonstrate progress unless 
he is willing to recognize facts as facts and to follow up with 
the necessary corrective action. We must give recognition to the 
attitude herein that reflects a determination not to whitewash 
the past. However, if we were to refer to that war as the 
"Pacific war" as labeled by the United States, we would have to 
say that the description is reflective of the "historical view 
of the Tokyo war tribunal" which provides a distorted view of 
facts subservient to the U.S. perception of the war. The war 
that was waged by Japan did not cover only the Pacific, but 
covered Asia, including the Indian subcontinent, and should 
accurately be titled the "East Asian war" or "Asian war." Then 
and now, the United States, which treats the Pacific as a 
national defense zone, felt it would be difficult to draft young 
men for service as officers and enlisted personnel in an Asian 
war and used as a national policy the slogan, calling for 
protection of the Pacific defense zone. Therefore, to accept 
that term indiscriminately would be incorrect and tantamount to 
saying, "World War II was an unavoidable defensive war that was 
forced upon the nation." 
  Now, we turn to the important topic of political reform, but 
an "ideological confrontation" exists within the coalition 
governing parties as to whether they should strive for a two 
major-party system or a form of government calling for a 
coalition of a fixed number of several parties such as three or 
four. Shinseito, Komeito, and the Democratic Socialist Party 
favor the two major-party system, while the Japan New Party, 
Sakigake, and the SDPJ prefer a multiple party coalition. 
Further, these differences have led to differences in the 
subject concerning a system combining single-seat constituencies 
with proportional representation in terms of increasing the 
authorized seats for the small electoral districts over those 
authorized for the proportional electoral districts or vice 
versa and in terms of whether priority should be given to a 
one-ballot system or a two-ballot system. 
<H5>  Spreading "Fear of Ozawa" </H5>
  "The SDPJ feels it will face a crisis in the disappearance 
of 
the party itself, if a one-ballot small electoral district 
system is implemented. It would be better for a SDPJ unchanged 
from the past to disappear. However, ever since the SDPJ became 
a member of the coalition governing parties, its officials have 
made an honest attempt to change. For example, when South Korea 
published new information on the Kim Dae-jung incident of South 
Korea, the SDPJ in the past would have reacted boisterously as 
if it were Kim Dae-jung himself, but Deputy Chairman Kanju Sato 
of the SDPJ, who is chairman of the National Public Safety 
Commission, stated at a news conference that the issue is one 
which has already been settled in diplomatic channels, but that 
if something is still at issue concerning the incident, the 
matter should be handled through diplomatic channels, not an 
incident which should require action on the part of 
investigative authorities. His statement was completely in 
order, but for someone who viewed the SDPJ in light of past 
practices, his response was astonishing. Further, relative to 
the Defense Agency's airborne warning and control system (AWACS) 
budget, the SDPJ has not altered its basic policy of opposition, 
but even Kosuke Uehara, director general of the Hokkaido 
Development, Okinawa Development, and National Land Agencies, 
who previously spearheaded opposition, said in a news conference 
that we should handle the issue with caution but that he would 
comply with any decision made by the prime minister or director 
general of the Defense Agency. This may be somewhat of an 
uncomplimentary remark, but one wonders if there is such a 
"reorientation effect," just because the SDPJ became one of the 
ruling parties." However, the situation reflects a change for 
the better and support for the SDPJ is growing for that very 
reason." 
  The Japan New Party and Sakigake fear that if a two 
major-party system is formed that they cannot ally themselves 
with the LDP and that, if they were to unite with the non-LDP 
forces, they would risk being controlled by Ichiro Ozawa, thus 
putting them in a position where they advocate a two-ballot 
system. This situation reflects the "fear of Ozawa" which also 
exists within the LDP. 
  "A look at the process for forming the coalition cabinet and 
the lineup for the cabinet clearly indicates "Ozawa 
initiatives." Because Mr. Ozawa made an early decision to 
support Mr. Hosokawa for prime minister and formed Shinseito and 
unified faction after making four officials including Mutsuki 
Kato secede from the LDP, even if Sakigake including Masayoshi 
Takemura were to join hands with the LDP, it would have resulted 
in two more seats being controlled by non-LDP forces, making an 
LDP government impossible and forcing Mr. Takemura to join the 
non-LDP elements. It is fact that the intensity with which the 
situation was handled had a negative effect on unity." 
  "As one views the cabinet lineup, it is only logical that 
Shinseito members with governing party experience filled 
important cabinet posts, because a decision had been made 
basically not to make any major changes from policies of the 
previous government. However, even then, they are all filled by 
Shinseito members, such as Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister 
and foreign minister; Hirohisa Fujii, minister of finance; 
Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry; 
and Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry, and 
fisheries. Further, even the post of director general of the 
Defense Agency was filled by Keisuke Nakanishi, a confidant of 
Mr. Ozawa who ranks equally with Mr. Kumagai. This means that 
from the standpoint of universally accepted concepts, Shinseito 
controls the innermost core posts, including those covering 
diplomacy, basic industry (including agriculture), and the 
military. From a human sentiment viewpoint, it is not a case 
where one cannot understand the fear exercised against Mr. Ozawa 
in any potential confrontation." 
  However, it would be a case of a fool judging everything by 
the one thing he knows, and it would show a lack of thorough 
analysis and shortsightedness "not seeing the forest for the 
trees," if one were to conclude that the situation with Mr. 
Ozawa is treated as a "two-tiered power system" like that which 
existed in the LDP under Tanaka, Takeshita, or Kanemaru as 
reported by the mass media. 
<H5>  Election-System Reform Will Require Time </H5>
  "A two-tiered power structure represents a system under 
which 
an individual like Kakuei Tanaka--who, although a member of the 
Diet, has seceded from the LDP and is no longer a member of the 
ruling party; and above all, he is unable to perform in an 
official capacity and is unable to assume official or political 
responsibility because he is criminally accused--assumes an 
absolutely irresponsible position by influencing official 
authority. However, Mr. Ozawa is currently a representative 
official, or so-called secretary general or chief secretary of 
the second ranking coalition party, is a member of the governing 
party liaison council treated as an official agency and a member 
of the House of Representatives Political Reform Special 
Committee that must implement political reform, the most 
important problem facing the cabinet, and thus placing him in a 
position where he must assume responsibilities both officially 
and politically. He reflects qualitatively an entirely different 
individual compared to the two-tiered undercover kingmaker of 
the LDP government days. This is a case where the mass media 
does not have an accurate grasp of the facts or where they 
merely distort the facts to sensationalize their reports." 
  "Moreover, under circumstances wherein there was no 
opposition party that would attempt to overthrow and replace 
the LDP, which established a stable government after winning a 
majority of Diet seats, there were many individuals including 
enough to spare who would truckle up to authority to become 
prime minister in the LDP, even after rebelling against Tanaka 
or even if Tanaka fired the last prime minister. And, even the 
LDP acted in such a disorderly way or the opposition party were 
to voice criticism, there was no chance whatsoever that the LDP 
would lose governmental power. It was under those circumstances 
that Tanaka, Takeshita, and Kanemaru were able to wield 
unlawful power. However, no longer will Ozawa fire Prime 
Minister Hosokawa because he dislikes him. Moreover, if Hosokawa 
resigns on his own volition and there are many people that want 
to replace him, the situation would be the same. As a minimum, 
the Japan New Party and Sakigake will probably secede from the 
coalition. And when that happens, the coalition will lose 
governing power. A strong opposition party known as the LDP will 
be vigilantly observing the situation with the intent of 
recovering governing power. The situation is now entirely 
different from the days when they spoke of control by the Tanaka 
faction or control by the Takeshita faction and Kanemaru or the 
Kanemaru-Takeshita-Ozawa days. Even if Ozawa wanted to become an 
undercover leader he would not be able to." 
  If Shinseito loses governing power and the LDP resumes 
government control, it is quite obvious that the LDP will use 
its authority to "destroy Ozawa." Unless Ozawa is willing to 
tolerate that which is intolerable and bear that which is 
unbearable, he will be unable to realize even a single political 
conviction. Wherein lies the "two-tiered authority?" The answer 
is obvious. 
  Further, the "theory of a temporary Hosokawa cabinet" is a 
topic that is popular with the mass media. If the main 
components of the political reform-related laws are not passed 
within the year, the prime minister will resign as he publicly 
pledged. Moreover, even if the main components are passed as 
law, the allocation of electoral districts must be handled by a 
third-party agency and decisions must be made on the 
establishment of the agencies and selection of staff. Even if 
the third-party agency is established, additional time will be 
required for allocation of districts if the laws provide for a 
two-ballot system centered on a proportional representation 
system as advocated by the Japan New Party. 
  "The process to be handled by the third-party agency will be 
relatively smooth if the law provides for 300 single-seat 
districts and 200 seats for proportional representation with a 
one-ballot system, because a trial plan covering that approach 
was completed by the government's Election System Council during 
the LDP government days. However, if they decide on a different 
system, it will mean that district allocations will have to be 
completely revamped. It would seem that a reduction from 300 to 
200 electoral districts would be a simple matter, but 
reallocation involves breaking up existing districts and merging 
several districts or altering traditional urban districts, 
inviting intense resistance. Even the establishment of the 
proposed 300 small electoral districts caused a lot of 
commotion. Changing that once more poses a very difficult task." 
  The district allocations must be included in a legislative 
proposal and approved by the Diet, which means that even if the 
principal components of the reform legislation are passed into 
law as pledged by the prime minister during the extraordinary 
session of the Diet in the fall, the earliest that the district 
allocation plan can be submitted to the Diet will be during the 
next extraordinary Diet session where it will require debate, 
providing for passage next summer at the earliest. Moreover, 
since it will be a major reform, provision must be made for 
familiarization and preparatory periods. Since such a period 
will require at least "several months" according to veteran 
member of the Election System Council Tan Horie, professor of 
Keio University, actual general elections cannot be held until 
year after next in 1995 at the earliest. Moreover, there is the 
possibility that Diet deliberations can be delayed because of 
the myriad of issues outstanding, such as economic 
countermeasures and international economic negotiations. 
<H5>  Hosokawa and Takemura Are Shrewd Individuals </H5>
  By just looking at the near-term political agenda limited to 
political reform, even if the Hosokawa cabinet endeavors to 
realize reform and enjoys the support of the public, it is 
obvious the task cannot be accomplished in one year. This means 
that the Hosokawa government must remain in power for more than 
one year. Needless to say, if the mass media forms a collusive 
relationship with the LDP for the sake of frustrating attempts 
at reform and thinks in terms of an early exit for Mr. Hosokawa, 
then the story will be different." 
  If one were to analyze why a seemingly fragmented opposition 
group formed a coalition, one will find that they realized that 
any LDP government would dissolve and call for general elections 
of the House of Representatives whenever it was to the latter's 
advantage and recover its majority in both the lower and upper 
houses, forcing the opposition to resign itself into being 
permanent elements of that fate. The coalition was formed 
because the parties involved realized that it was necessary to 
control the authority to dissolve the House of Representatives 
as well as the authority to govern. I would think that they are 
determined to preserve unity, conduct concurrent upper and lower 
house elections two years later under the new system and 
continue in government. Now that they are in power, they must 
have realized the "value of being in power." Having come to that 
realization, they probably will not relinquish power so easily. 
To begin with, the purpose of political parties is to serve as 
the group and the means for implementing policies reflecting 
pledges made to the public whose goals cannot be achieved 
without being in control of the government. To embrace that 
thought process is logical whether it be the LDP or any other 
party and any party in power that says, "We are not ardently 
attached to our government authority," would be displaying an 
attitude that is tantamount to the abandonment of duties or 
position as politicians and party members. 
  Further, the inaccuracy of the "theory of Ozawa authority" 
lies in the fact that advocates of that theory are not aware of 
the shrewdness of the Prime Minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura. 
  "The Hosokawa clan included Makitaka Hosokawa (pen name 
Yusai) first-generation head of clan who served and sustained, 
during the turbulent war days, prominent figures with strong 
personalities such as Akiyoshi Ashikaga, Nobunaga Oda, Hideyoshi 
Toyotomi, and Ieyasu Tokugawa. After Mitsuhide Akechi conquered 
Nobunaga at Honno Temple and his daughter Tama (Christian name 
Galatia) married into the Hosokawa clan, the former asked the 
Hosokawa clan to ally itself with him, but the latter rejected 
the request, while not allying itself with Hideyoshi, preserving 
the clan and demonstrating the presence of considerable 
resourcefulness and skills in conducting unflagging 
negotiations. It is said that that resourcefulness originated 
with experience gained during the feudal age and Chinese 
classics, while the current prime minister has been trained in 
the "Hosokawa clan discipline." The prime minister was tutored 
in Chinese books such as the Analects of Confucius, was exhorted 
by his grandfather Moritaka to meet with "first-class 
personalities" and has observed politics through frequent 
meetings with the late Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida. Hosokawa 
is also of a lineage including ancestors with brutal powers to 
act in connection with reform such as father of the revival of 
the Hosokawa clan Shigenori (8th generation) and Morihisa (14th 
generation). He has also observed the actions of his late 
grandfather Prince Fumimaro Konoe. He is no one to be 
disregarded." 
  "Mr. Takemura is also an individual who has served as 
governor in the Omi region (Shiga Prefecture) whose `merchants 
are known for their shrewdness.' He vacillated somewhat between 
remaining an LDP member or becoming a non-LDP Diet member and in 
the end shrewdly assumed the key cabinet position of chief 
cabinet secretary. Moreover, he appointed as deputy chief 
cabinet secretary Yukio Hatoyama the eldest son of a 
distinguished family and member of the same Sakigake, while 
appointing as the prime minister's special assistant Hideyuki 
Tanaka also a member of Sakigake, thus consolidating the Prime 
Minister's Official Residence with close associates. Typical of 
Ministry of Home Affairs bureaucrats, he is of a character that 
defies conjecture." 
  The LDP has been relegated to the status of opposition 
party, 
is overwhelmed by a on-rushing sense of desolation, lacks 
factional leadership, is short of funds, controls no cabinet 
posts, and is plagued with a psychological disintegration 
phenomenon. There's even the observation that it is more 
vulnerable than the coalition parties. Even in that sense, we 
are at a "new historical departure point."

University of Tsukuba: "The First Great Recession"] 
  [Text] Part 1. Terrifying Resemblance Between Early 
Showa and Early Heisei 
  In retrospect, the Fifth Year of Heisei [1993] paralleled 
the 
5th Year of Showa [1930], the year of the "Showa Depression", in 
so many ways. The year 1993 coincides strikingly with the year 
1930: The aggravation of a deflationary recession under the 
sluggish world economy, a belt-tightening economic policy which 
has enhanced such deterioration, a worsening domestic 
agricultural situation, increasing criticism of the government's 
handling of international negotiations, and so on. 
  Furthermore, the economy in the first five years of the 
Showa 
period [1926-1989] was in a period of deflation in which the 
price level dropped approximately 50 percent. In comparison, 
Japan was hit by "asset deflation" in which stock and land 
prices dropped by about half in the first five years of the 
Heisei period [1989]. 
  The difference between the Heisei and the Showa is that 
stocking of the economy has progressed in the Heisei period as 
the accumulation of assets has proceeded. It is not difficult 
to imagine, therefore, that the current sharp decline in asset 
values has had an extremely serious effect on the overall 
economy. 
<H3>  Mistakes by Policymaking Bodies has Lead the Economy Into a 
Bottomless Pit </H3>
  As the deflationary recession of the Showa period came from 
outside Japan, so did the beginning of the Heisei's asset 
deflation. Its origin can be traced back to Black Monday in 1987 
in the United States, and more recently, to the collapse of 
Eastern Europe in 1989 (the first year of Heisei). In 
particular, worldwide monetary tightening was caused by a major 
change in the flow of world funds because the former West 
Germany had to financially support the collapsed former East 
Germany. 
  As a result, the stock and real estate markets of Western 
nations, which are sensitive to interest rates, were hit 
directly and almost without exception, and stock and land prices 
dropped steeply. It was only a matter of time before the 
effects were felt in Japan. 
  Along with such external factors, there was the domestic 
"policy slump" factor behind recession in Japan. That is, when 
asset deflation had become serious due to the collapse of stock 
and land prices in Europe and the United States in the beginning 
of the 1990's, Japan, without considering the international 
situation, exercised excessive monetary restraint out of fear of 
domestic inflation. 
  In fact, this "misgovernment factor" is another echo of the 
Showa Depression. At that time the government adopted an 
austerity policy to deal with the anticipated impact in Japan of 
the Great Depression. In particular, the lifting of the gold 
embargo at the old parity rate is well known to have aggravated 
domestic deflation. 
  Unfortunately, present-day policymakers lacked a global 
point 
of view and carried out over-regulated loan restriction and a 
strengthening of the tax system to "break the bubble economy" 
domestically. As a result, asset markets, including the land 
market, became inactive. Above all, the impact of quantitative 
regulation of loans for real estate, and the strengthening of 
taxes on real estate through the administrative guidance of the 
Bank of Japan [BOJ] and the Ministry of Finance was extremely 
large. This can be said to be the biggest cause of the Japanese 
economy being driven into a bottomless recession. 
  Since then, regulations and taxes for land have not really 
changed, except for a perfunctory relaxation of monetary 
conditions. Partly as a result of that, as you can see in Table 
1, there is as yet no indication of land prices ceasing to fall 
in metropolitan areas, and the rate of decline is growing in 
local areas. Besides, as there is no trade in the market, real 
prices are definitely lower than those shown in the table.

<H5>  `Heisei Depression' Has Begun </H5>
  As we look at the similarities between the Heisei and the 
Showa more and more, it becomes clear the comparison can be 
grasped better if we consider the "Heisei Depression" to have 
already started. In particular, the following are emerging as 
the characteristics of Japanese-type depression caused by asset 
deflation. 
<H5>  (1) Financial Crisis Is Progressing </H5>
  Because asset deflation occurred rapidly, almost all large 
real estate loans became nonperforming loans, and the balance 
sheets of financial institutions were seriously undermined. The 
total amount of bad loans in the widest sense, including loans 
where the market value of the collateral is now less than the 
value of the loan, is said to be 100 trillion yen. In 
particular, most of the weaker small and medium financial 
institutions have virtually failed, and there was even a case of 
a run on a regional bank due to the large withdrawal of 
deposits. Currently, regional shinkin banks [credit unions] and 
credit cooperatives are undergoing reorganization and 
consolidation. In the circumstances, the financial intermediary 
function of the private sector has almost come to a halt, and 
private lending has increased little. 
<H5>  (2) Frequent Occurrence of Business Failures </H5>
  Most corporations, including Japan's leading big businesses, 
lost their latent assets, and are now suffering from the weight 
of liabilities. In particular, "enterprises of good standing" 
that had carried out aggressive, growth-oriented management in 
the past are more likely to be practically bankrupted because 
their liabilities exceed their assets. Instances of listed 
major enterprises going into bankruptcy have begun to appear, 
and it has been predicted that there might well be between 20 
and 30 cases of large-scale bankruptcy. Also, many small and 
medium companies that have been raising funds by offering assets 
such as land as security are now deadlocked in terms of both 
finance and business, and small-scale bankruptcies are rapidly 
increasing. 
<H5>  (3) Era of Mass Dismissals Begins </H5>
  The number of unemployed has already reached 2 million, and 
there are estimated to be a further 3 million who are employed 
but have no real job to do. Companies have begun to cut such 
surplus workers. Although companies have to cut staff costs if 
they are to survive, it is difficult to cut wages and bonuses 
uniformly. As the number of jobs drops, the number of surplus 
staff within companies is increasing. Therefore, there is no 
alternative to cutting surplus workers at the moment. The 
unemployment rate will sharply rise to the Western levels, and 
the ratio of job openings to job seekers will keep on dropping. 
<H5>  (4) Vicious Cycle of Price Destruction Continues </H5>
  As the "price destruction" of assets occurred, with stock 
and 
land prices dropping by half from their peaks, sharp reductions 
in price have now become a matter of course in all sectors. To 
the detriment of below-cost prices, bargain sales are being held 
to recover funds, and this initiates the price destruction 
effect. This will lead to a further cut in costs, bringing 
employment adjustment, wage cuts, and investment restraint. 
Those firms that cannot handle the process will go bankrupt. 
Also, there will be price destruction from the demand side too 
as the buying strength and intentions of individuals and 
companies contracts. The liquidation of assets to cover 
ordinary losses triggers a further decline in stock and land 
prices, and everything contributes to drag deflation down 
further. 
  In addition to the impact of the above discussed process, 
which accelerates in a vicious cycle, the economy seems to be 
driven to a state of depression influenced by confusion in 
politics over "the issue of liberalizing rice imports" and "the 
political reform issue". 
  Therefore, if what is happening from 1993 to 1994 were 
videotaped and played back in the "fast play mode", one would 
see that a depression, which is what happened in the early Showa 
period, is underway at the moment. 
<H5>  Will There Be `Sudden Death'? </H5>
  Why, then, is the "Heisei Depression" emerging at such a 
slow 
pace? 
  The first reason is that corporations and banks which gained 
strength by accumulating assets continue to support their 
"keiretsu" companies and business connections without disclosing 
that the firms have in effect failed. In particular, a problem 
company which has collateral now worth less than its loan, and 
where the relation of rights to that collateral have become 
complicated, cannot be easily closed down, especially if it is a 
large-scale business. In other words, "an attempt to solve the 
issue is deferred by sharing the burden", and it requires time 
to solve the problem. 
  Secondly, there is the underlying support of enormous public 
funds. Over the past two years, expenditure of 30 trillion yen 
in projects has been made, and this public finance has been 
distributed mainly in housing and among small and medium 
business. In particular, lending through the Housing Loan 
Corporation generates housing demand among the primary 
acquisition class, which was affected little by asset deflation, 
and works to keep the bottomless fall of the economy from coming 
to light. 
  However, it is doubtful that this support will last much 
longer. Even powerful corporations and banks are losing their 
own latent assets due to the influence of the deflationary 
recession, and it has, therefore, become difficult for them to 
support companies in trouble any longer. Also, there is a 
growing resistance to the further expansion of public support 
measures because the steep decline in tax revenue is directly 
hitting the government. 
  Furthermore, demand for housing cannot be expected to 
increase any further if the influence of unemployment and 
bankruptcies is going to reach white-collar workers as the 
recession worsens. 
  If existing support is cut and the underpinnings of the 
economy are lost, problems will rise to the surface at once. In 
that case, there would be a danger of "sudden death" depression 
in Japan, accompanied, typically, by panic. 
  How can we tell, then, if "sudden death" will come, or the 
"state of coma" will continue with the economy remaining 
sluggish, or if there is going to be a sign of recovery in the 
future? 
  The answer cannot be found, as before, by using the real 
growth rate as the economic indicator, and interest rates and 
spending as the policymaking indicators. Rather, nominal growth 
rate, price trends, and trends in land and stock prices are more 
important. In other words, one must pay attention to the 
nominal rate of deflation, not the real rate. 
  The reason is that if general prices and stock and land 
prices keep declining in nominal terms, the weight of 
liabilities will become unbearable sooner or later, but if such 
prices start to rise, then the burden of liabilities becomes 
lighter. 
  As the rate of deflation increases, the burden of real 
interest rates becomes heavier, and vice versa. In other words, 
whether the deflation becomes worse, stops, or turns in the 
direction of inflation is the biggest factor in predicting 
whether the future economy suffers a "sudden death" depression, 
becomes "a vegetable", or shows signs of recovery. 
  The reason the traditional economic forecast model was not 
able to predict the current deep recession is because it only 
focused on analysis income or profit and loss, and ignored 
changes in assets or balance sheets. The model also looked only 
at real growth rate as the key economic indicator, and it saw 
prices only as a measure of inflation. 
<H5>  The Lessons To Be Learned From Our History and From Abroad </H5>
  In the Sixth Year of Showa (1931), the second year of the 
Showa Depression, the recession became more serious both at home 
and abroad. Unemployment increased rapidly in the cities, and 
rural communities became more impoverished. Social unrest and 
discontent were on the rise. In September of the same year, the 
Manchurian Incident broke out. The world was plunged into an 
uproar, and social confusion reached new heights. Meanwhile, 
criticism of the Minseito [Constitutional Democratic Party] 
cabinet, which persisted with its policy of austerity and 
lifting the gold embargo, became so strong that it ultimately 
led to the mass resignation of the cabinet in December. Its 
successor cabinet, led by Tsuyoshi Inukai of Seiyukai [Friends 
of the Constitutional Government Party], immediately announced 
the end of the gold standard system, began a positive financial 
policy, and avoided economic catastrophe through special loans 
from the BOJ. 
  Will the Sixth Year of Heisei (1994) follow the pattern of 
the Sixth Year of Showa, which became a historical turning 
point? Will the "Heisei Depression" last another year? Does 
the government have to be changed to achieve a change in policy? 
On monetary policy, will special lending be delayed until the 
change in BOJ governor planned for December 1994? 
  At any rate, the policies needed to stop further deflation 
and avoid the "sudden death" depression have become clear, and a 
consensus has already formed in the market. They include the 
following "three measures" which highlight the liquidation of 
land. Most of the measures are already recognized by the market. 
<H5>  1. Income Tax Cuts Totaling More Than 10 Trillion Yen </H5>
  The implementation of large-scale income tax reduction, not 
as tax reform accompanied by a tax increase but as an economic 
stimulus measure financed by the issue of deficit-covering 
bonds. Tax cuts of 5 to 6 trillion yen have already been 
discounted, and cuts of more than 10 trillion yen is expected. 
<H5>  2. Sharp Reduction in Official Discount Rate </H5>
  Since prices are declining due to deflation, nominal 
interest 
rates must be lowered as close as possible to zero. What is 
needed, to begin with, is a sharp cut in the official discount 
rate to less than 1 percent, and measures to aggressively 
increase the money supply. 
<H5>  3. Liquidating Land and Measures for Bad Loans </H5>
  The write-off of bad loans by financial institutions should 
be accelerated by encouraging transaction in land through the 
use of public funds, along with a relaxation of the controls and 
tax systems related to land. In such a case, it is necessary to 
reorganize small and medium financial institutions which are 
close to failure through the issue of special BOJ loans. 
  In this respect, the way U.S. savings and loan associations 
were consolidated, or the "life boat plan" in which British 
nonbanking financial institutions were reorganized are both 
noteworthy. In particular, the way the U.S. RTC (Resolution 
Trust Corporation) solved the issue of bad loans by seizing and 
liquidating the assets of failed savings and loan associations, 
can be considered a good example of how to solve the problems 
Japan is now facing. 
  If the government is going to adopt such measures to stop 
the 
deflation of assets, depression can be avoided, the decline in 
land prices will stop, and there will be the possibility of 
signs of future recovery. 
  Faced with the first deep recession since the war, the 
common 
sense and experience which have held true only within postwar 
Japan have lost their validity. Whether we can learn from our 
own history and from international experience is the question 
now.

Edition] 
  [Text] The government plans to decide early next week on a 
new package of measures to stimulate the economy, measures which 
will focus on expanding Japan's imports. Major steps in the 
package are: 1) to increase funds for the industrial 
infrastructure in order to upgrade the existing import-related 
infrastructure and the foreign access zone (FAZ); 2) to build 
additional or expand existing import-related facilities -- 
including the General Import Promotion Center -- in an effort to 
help foreign firms smoothly gain access to the Japanese market; 
and 3) to strengthen the import promotion tax and import loan 
system. Prime Minister Hosokawa expressed his intention last 
December to expand Japan's imports, setting the "basic policy 
for import expansion." The government plans to take these steps 
on the eve of Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for February in 
order to boost Japan's imports, with the aim of stressing 
Japan's posture to cut its trade surplus with the United States. 
  In the new pump-priming package, the government intends to 
upgrade the FAZ ahead of schedule, which is equipped with 
storage and disposal functions at its ports and airports. The 
government plans to add approximately 4 billion yen to the funds 
for the industrial infrastructure to partially finance the cost 
of constructing import-related complexes and installing 
facilities there in six areas including the Kansai International 
Airport and Kobe Port. The government also intends to make 
preparations for securing sites in five areas where the 
construction of import-related complexes were approved in 1993. 
  In the new package of stimulus measures, the government 
plans 
to construct more import-related facilities in a bid to help 
foreign companies smoothly gain access to the Japanese market. 
The government intends to additionally establish two general 
import promotion centers where foreign firms are given free 
offices and can display and sell their goods, as well as three 
regional import promotion centers. The government also plans to 
establish four imported housing exhibition centers. 
  The government believes upgrading the existing 
import-related 
infrastructure and facilities will greatly contribute to 
expanding Japan's imports of manufactured goods. The Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry, which intends to ask for a 
total of 10 billion yen in the third supplementary budget, is 
now negotiating with the Ministry of Finance. 
  In the new stimulus package, the government will strengthen 
the preferential tax system and the policy loan system for both 
foreign firms eager to invest in Japan as well as Japanese 
importers. As for the import tax system for Japanese 
manufacturers and wholesalers who import foreign manufactured 
goods, the government will keep the system in effect after the 
end of March 1995. Imported housing, some auto parts, and other 
items which the multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay 
Round of GATT) decided to abolish duties on immediately, will be 
subject to tax deductions. The government plans to establish a 
preferential tax system during 1994 under which a certain ratio 
of the taxes from increased sales by foreign firms in Japan over 
the previous year is deducted. 
  The Japan Development Bank established the loan system in 
late December 1993 for the import promotion and strengthening of 
the infrastructure, and the government will ask the Small 
Business Finance Corporation to extend the loan system for 
smooth import and sales by the end of March 1995.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of International </F>
Trade and Industry, by ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter Kenji Takeuchi; 
place and date not given; first paragraph is introduction by 
Kenji Takeuchi] 
  [Text] The political situation has become further 
confused due to the disapproval of political reform bills by the 
House of Councilors at its plenary session. The government and 
ruling coalition parties failed to carry out their scenario that 
"efforts will be concentrated on working out economic stimulus 
measures and on dealing with the new Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks so as to tide over the Japan-U.S. summit talks 
scheduled for 11 February." We asked Hiroshi Kumagai, minister 
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI], to 
express his views on how to deal with the situation in his 
capacity as the cabinet member responsible for economic policies 
and trade negotiations, and also on an incident that took place 
toward last year-end in which he and MITI officials were at odds 
over personnel affairs. 
  [Takeuchi] What will happen to measures for stimulating the 
economy? 
  [Kumagai] There is no choice but to put them off. If the 
House of Councilors had approved the political reform bills, we 
would have started dealing with the issue the same evening. 
However, under this unstable political situation, there is 
nothing we can do. If we should fail to achieve the political 
reform as soon as possible, we will have troubles. 
<H5>  Difficulty in Conducting Coordination Among Ruling Parties </H5>
  [Takeuchi] Why is it that priority cannot be given to 
working out economic stimulus measures, which is now an urgent 
task? 
  [Kumagai] It will not do to use tricks in working out 
measures this time. Nor can we expect any good effects. It 
will be necessary to work out measures while taking into 
consideration such issues as how to create the Japan of the next 
age and how to reform the economic structure. At the same time, 
we also have to settle other important issues. For example, 
there are issues on the scale and allotment of tax cut; on how 
to secure financial resources for this purpose; and on how to 
distribute funds for public works projects. For this purpose, 
political coordination must be conducted among various circles 
with different interests. However, we cannot tackle those 
issues without settling the issue of political reform while 
relations among the ruling coalition parties remain tense. I 
hope our people will understand that the situation is different 
from the situation under the one-party rule of the Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP]. 
  [Takeuchi] Do you mean that the people will have to "wait"? 
  [Kumagai] No, that's not what I mean. However, the final 
decision on these measures can be made only when the issue of 
the political framework has been decided. We have been studying 
the economic stimulus measures at the working level and have 
entered the stage of the political-level coordination now. That 
is the very reason why we have kept stressing "the importance of 
political reform." 
  [Takeuchi] The MITI bureau concerned and the Ministry of 
Finance [MOF] have worked out an economic stimulus package 
mainly consisting of "plans to win approval for implementing an 
income tax cut and for consumption tax increase at the same time 
and to implement an income tax cut in advance." Negotiations 
are under way now to lay the groundwork for this purpose. I 
understand that it has been criticized that "the bureaucrats are 
trying to have their own way." What do you think of it? 
  [Kumagai] We give our full support to their efforts. 
Officials concerned are making moves with the approval of both 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii and myself. We can make no 
compromise on a plan to win approval for the tax raise and tax 
cut at the same time. Without this approval, we will end up in 
issuing deficit-covering bonds without limit and lose public 
trust in our policies. I myself have said that "support will be 
given to the MOF to the very end." I think Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa shares the same understanding with me. 
  [Takeuchi] However, a negative stance on the package has 
been voiced not only by the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ], but also by others, including the Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party]. 
  [Kumagai] If compromise should be made at the present stage, 
the package plans may easily be abolished one by one. It is 
true that it is not easy to overcome opposition against the 
package. The final decision will be made through deliberations 
among the ruling coalition parties. However, we are determined 
to carry out many debates. 
<H5>  Negotiations To Be Concluded Before Summit Meeting </H5>
  [Takeuchi] The Japan-U.S. framwork talks are deadlocked. In 
particular, there is an impasse in the negotiations on 
automobiles and auto parts, which are under the MITI's 
jurisdiction. How will the present political turmoil affect the 
negotiations? 
  [Kumagai] Since negotiations on macroeconomic policy, 
including the issue of Japanese economic stimulation measures, 
are an important component of the framework talks, this delay in 
pump-priming measures is a serious problem. However, it is 
wrong to say that "there has been no progress at all in 
negotiations in specific sectors." From the beginning, Japan 
has asserted that "automobiles is a private sector problem." 
Moreover, the Hosokawa administration is trying to change the 
relationship between the government and the private sector. We 
have also stressed that the government does not intend to issue 
orders to the private sector. I think the United States has 
come to understand us more on this point. As the trade 
imbalance actually exists, we also think that coexistence and 
coprosperity under the principle of expanded equilibrium is 
necessary. Nevertheless, we cannot accept numerical targets. 
  [Takeuchi] The United States has been criticizing the 
bureaucracy. 
  [Kumagai] If the United States thinks that there are 
differences in views between myself and the administrative 
staff, then that is a misunderstanding. However, if they want 
to talk with a cabinet minister, I am ready at all times. In 
any case, we would like to conclude the negotiations before the 
Japan-U.S. summit talks on 11 February. For the Hosokawa 
administration, the framework talks have been inherited from the 
LDP administration. The summit meeting should also not be 
adversely affected by the talks. I hope the summit will dwell 
on cooperation on a global scale, and signal the start of a new 
Japan-U.S. relationship. 
<H5>  Rule Violations Should Not Be Tolerated </H5>
  [Takeuchi] While you seem to agree completely with your 
administrative staff on policy, there was criticism against 
"uncalled-for political interference in the bureaucratic 
organization" in relation to the resignation of Masahisa Naito, 
director general of the Industrial Policy Bureau. 
  [Kumagai] It was not my intention to raise the greater issue 
of the relationship between the bureaucracy and politicians in 
that affair. For me, it was simply a question of what to do 
with a lingering problem. I would like to ask the critics in 
return, "should the problem be left untouched?" There was a 
clear violation of rules, and this has been exposed to the 
public. If nothing was done about this, it would mean rules can 
be ignored. 
  [Takeuchi] The critics say that "it is unfair that those who 
circulated the mysterious document [exposing irregularities in 
MITI personnel matters] were not punished." 
  [Kumagai] If you want to talk about the mysterious letter, 
what happened after that was even more abominable. Letters and 
phone calls bordering on blackmail abounded, and some 
bureaucrats make up things to the mass media. It was like all 
the dirty linen of the bureaucracy was at once being washed in 
public. 
  [Takeuchi] Are you saying interference will still be 
necessary in the future? 
  [Kumagai] No. Generally speaking, one has to refrain from 
interfering in personnel matters. This time, the case was very 
rare and very unusual. However, regardless of this issue, I 
still think that it is questionable that bureaucrats are not 
made to take responsibility for the outcome, although they are 
the ones who make policy. Right now, we do not even have a 
system of assessing policy results. If they say they cannot 
take the responsibility, they should let the politicians make 
policy decisions. If it is "policymaking without taking the 
responsibility for the outcome," then it would be like an armed 
force with no civilian control.

Toru Takeda, and Takashi Arimoto: "The Silent Power; Some 
Thoughts on National Defense"] 
<H5>  [13 Oct 93 p 9] </H5>
  [Text] Incoming Missiles Targeting Central Tokyo Can 
Be Intercepted Over Shinagawa 10 Seconds Before Reaching Targets 
  The end to the cold war has intensified the worldwide 
movement towards arms reduction and, even in Japan, domestic 
demand is growing for cuts in defense spending. However, 
Northeastern Asia presents a different picture from that of 
Europe, and military expansion continues. The question is, what 
sort of measures should Japan take for its national defense in 
view of such circumstances? This series of articles examines the 
situation on the forward defense perimeter in search of a 
departure from an unwarranted sense of "peaceful 
well-being." 
<H5>  Launching of Missile Without Advance Warning </H5>
  "It appears your country launched a missile into the Sea of 
Japan. It is regrettable that the launching took place without 
any prior notification." 
  When it became clear in mid-June that North Korea 
(Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea) had launched the Nodong-1 
medium-range missile towards central Japan, unpublished 
activities took place at the Japanese Embassy in Beijing. The 
above quote is from a telephone call made by then-Minister 
Kunihiko Makita (currently secretary to the prime minister) to 
Counselor Pak Tok-kyun of the North Korean Embassy. Routine 
procedures called for contacts with North Korea through the 
Beijing embassies in the absence of formal diplomatic relations 
with the latter. 
  When missiles are launched in open seas around Japan, the 
general assembly resolutions of the International Maritime 
Organization of which North Korea is a member require advance 
notifications to the Japanese Government in order to provide for 
safe navigation of ships. Based on the advance notification, the 
Maritime Safety Board issues navigation warning advisories 
indicating the maritime zones at risk. Even the former USSR gave 
the Maritime Safety Agency five days advance notice of 
launchings. The reason for such measures is that no ship desires 
to become the target of missiles without advance warning. 
However, in the recent launching, North Korea took no advance 
notification actions whatsoever. 
  Counselor Pak interrupted just as Mr. Makita continued, "We 
are concerned with your country's development and export of 
missiles," and arbitrarily cut off the telephone call as he 
said, "Japan is forever making remarks of that nature." 
  A country that is completely lacking in the will to observe 
international rules possesses a 1,000-kilometer ballistic 
missile that is able to reach all regions of western Japan. The 
question is, what measure should be taken in response to this 
situation. 
  Officials of the Japan Defense Agency clarify Japan's air 
defense system as follows: 
  Once Nodong-1 is launched, it reaches its destination in 
about seven minutes. During that flight time, air defense 
centers of the Air Self-Defense Force [ASDF] located in four 
places such as Sayama city, Saitama Prefecture, must detect the 
missile and direct and execute interception. 
  However, the 28 radar sites of the ASDF located throughout 
Japan are not capable of detecting missiles launched from the 
Korean peninsula or the flight patterns of objects in outer 
space. The reason is that they were designed to track such 
targets as aircraft and missiles in the inner atmosphere. They 
have no choice but to respond to attacks from outer space by 
using radar to barely capture objects as they reenter inner 
space at the tremendous speed of about Mach 10. 
  In the event that North Korea develops a missile capable of 
reaching the Japanese capital of Tokyo and targets it, the 
mission of initial interception will be assigned to the ASDF air 
defense missile squadron at Takeyama in Yokosuka. The reason for 
this assignment is that the nationwide six-location, 24-unit air 
defense missile system is so roughly structured that it will 
allow enemy missiles to slip through the network. The 
surface-to-air missiles (SAM) known as Patriots assigned to air 
defense missile squadrons at Takeyama will be able to intercept 
missiles above Shinagawa 10 seconds before they reach their 
targets. Even if the Patriots succeed in intercepting their 
incoming targets, the situation will pose a frightening one in 
which debris will fall into the heart of the Tokyo metropolitan 
area. 
  Moreover, Patriots currently assigned are designed to deal 
with aircraft and "are not designed to cope with incoming 
missiles approaching from a very high, almost vertical angle," 
according to Shigeru Hatakeyama, administrative vice minister of 
defense. Patriot II improved missiles used by the U.S. Forces 
during the Gulf war are capable of intercepting, to a degree, 
such high-angle missiles, according to Administrative Vice 
Minister Hatakeyama, but actual deployment is not expected until 
1996. 
<H5>  Situation Exceeds Limits of Self-Defense </H5>
  Although Colonel Sumio Hirai of the ASDF First Air Defense 
Missile Group points out that, "The current version of the 
Patriot could be used, if incoming targets could be intercepted 
by radar systems. However, we must rely on the United States for 
initial detection capabilities. The ultimate question is, how 
much intelligence would the United States be willing to supply 
the SDF units?" 
  A key strategy for intercepting Nodong-1 is the theater 
missile defense (TMD) system proposed as a joint development 
project to Vice Minister Hatakeyama by U.S. Under Secretary of 
Defense Deutsch in the latter part of September. This strategy 
calls for reconnaissance satellites to detect launchings of 
enemy missiles and to relay the intelligence to earth where 
intercepting missiles would be launched from such facilities as 
Patriot missile launchers, Aegis naval ships, and tactical 
ultra-high-altitude air defense systems. 
  TMD poses such bottlenecks as 1) exercise of collective 
defense rights which is not sanctioned by the Constitution; 2) 
inconsistency with Diet resolutions calling for the peaceful use 
of space; and 3) price tag of 1 trillion yen. 
  However, the situation is such that it exceeds the limits of 
case-by-case defense rights. Moreover, Japan has, in reality, 
forfeited its option to develop a full-scale intelligence 
capability. In passing the "resolution for peaceful use of 
space," it decided not to possess spy satellites. Japan has 
entrusted the United States with its national defense through 
intelligence supplied by U.S. military satellites. 
  The question is whether Japan will join in a regional 
defense 
system or develop an independent satellite system. Nodong-1 will 
force Japan to conduct a fundamental review of its defense 
policy. 
<H5>  Proposals by 200 Individuals To Change Japan </H5>
<H5>  A Proposal for a Crisis Management and Early Warning System </H5>
  Comments by Satoshi Morimoto, Senior Researcher, Nomura 
General Research Center 
  North Korea's objective for launching its medium-range 
ballistic missile Nodong-1 has not surpassed the realm of 
speculation, but it is conceivable that they merely wished to 
demonstrate the vulnerability of Japanese security and 
diplomacy. Accordingly, there is the possibility that North 
Korea will use Nodong-1 as a lever in conducting future 
diplomacy. 
  In the middle of June, the then-Chief Cabinet Secretary Kono 
announced the missile launching. I believe that the government 
made that announcement to signal to the general public a warning 
that there is a need to take a more serious stance concerning 
threats from North Korea, but if Japan should react in a more 
serious way, it would be playing into the hands of North Korean 
strategy. Japan must take military threats seriously, but it 
must not be intimidated into falling prey to its threats. 
  TMD research should probably be carried on as a Japan-U.S. 
joint project. However, the question remains as to whether the 
government has the determination to overcome problems concerning 
the system, such as 1) legal issues, 2) huge costs, and 3) 
military effectiveness and costs versus the end product. 
  However, if one were to ask if TMD alone could save the 
nation from threats, the answer is no. I believe the more 
serious issue facing the nation is the lack of a crisis 
management system. 
  As for the question of what Japan should do if a threat 
arises before the deployment of TMD, it has no answer. The 
government would be highly irresponsible if it were to inform 
the general public of a threat without the answers to such 
questions. 
  Threats such as those posed by Nodong-1 cannot be handled by 
Japan alone. We must structure a regional early warning 
intelligence system operating not only for the sake of Japan, 
but northeastern Asia as a whole. 
  The prohibition concerning the exercise of collective 
self-defense rights is a mere legal formality. National security 
in the true sense cannot be attained unless we surpass and 
overcome the limitations of collective self-defense rights in a 
military sense in responding to the threat of ballistic missiles 
and nuclear weapons of a sophisticated nature. 
  It is probably important that we visualize the unexpected 
and 
develop a substantial system and enhanced capabilities to 
respond expeditiously to situations as a nation. 
  Warranting special attention is the potential for emergency 
situations in the post-cold war era of a scale less than war 
such as massive movements of refugees and a threat to maritime 
navigation owing to territorial disputes in the South China Sea. 
There is a need to conduct preparatory training on a national 
scale and to make advance preparations for interministry 
procedures. We must not shun such tasks as undesirable 
governmental missions.

  [Text] South Korea Exercises Effective Control Over 
Takeshima and Japan Can Take No Countermeasures 
  Takeshima [Liancourt Rocks], called Tok Do by South 
Korea, is situated midway between Japan and South Korea and even 
to this day is the subject of a territorial dispute between the 
two nations. Ever since South Korea established offshore 
territorial boundaries extending 12 nautical miles or 22 
kilometers offshore in 1953, South Korea has posted a patrol 
ship inside the 12-nautical-mile line, while Japan has posted a 
similar ship just outside the line, creating a tense 
confrontation at times. 
<H5>  Confrontation of Tensions </H5>
  Captain Yoshiro Kanetomo, 51, of the patrol ship "Wakasa," 
which had patrolled the waters around Takeshima for two and a 
half years and was reassigned to duty at the Tamano Maritime 
Safety Region since October 1993 cannot forget what happened one 
day in May 1993. 
  It was just past 2000 hours, when the Wakasa reached waters 
just beyon the 12-nautical-mile line near Takeshima. 
  Suddenly, the crew noticed a ship in the dark approaching at 
a very high speed. The lights on the ship differed from those 
found on a freighter or fishing vessel. Captain Kanetomo sensed 
an inexplicable fear from the rapidly approaching ship. 
  When the approaching ship was one kilometer away, the 
wireless radio received an inquiry asking "Unknown ship 
[identify yourself]." The Wakasa replied, "This is the Wakasa, a 
Japanese patrol ship. What are you?" The approaching ship then 
responded in a stern voice, "Korean Navy. What are you doing 
here?" 
  The Wakasa replied, "We are patrolling Takeshima, Japanese 
territory." 
  The South Korean naval ship responded, "This is not 
Takeshima. It is Tok Do. Do not approach; it is a South Korean 
island." 
  After completing this tense exchange of words, the two ships 
confronted each other with floodlights at a distance of 500 
meters. The purpose was to mutually confirm the nationality and 
name of the vessels. The tense confrontation lasted for a few 
moments and then the South Korean naval ship made a U-turn into 
its 12-nautical-mile territorial waters. 
  "Since darkness of night makes identification of the 
opposing 
ships difficult, we tend to become tense. In any event, we make 
a special effort not to create trouble in and around Takeshima." 
  As indicated by this statement by Captain Kanetomo, the 
Japanese Government's basic stance on the Takeshima issue is 
that 1) it will seek a peaceful solution, and 2) it will not 
take any controversial actions. 
  The Takeshima issue finds its origin in the establishment of 
the Rhee Line and the inclusion of Takeshima in 1952 by 
President Rhee during a vacuum created by the suspension of 
Japanese rule under the provisions of the Occupation Memorandum 
of 1946. After a series of incidents including the removal of 
Japanese territorial signs and shootings at patrol ships, South 
Korea used military force to occupy Takeshima in 1954. 
  Later, in connection with the signing of the Japan-South 
Korea Basic Treaty in 1965, foreign ministers of both nations 
left the issue open for resolution through peaceful means by 
stating in the official documents exchanged concerning 
settlement of disputes, "Disputes between the two nations shall 
be resolved through diplomatic channels. In the event such 
efforts fail to produce resolutions, the matters shall be 
subjected to mediation." 
<H5>  South Korea Permanently Stations Security Forces </H5>
  However, despite the foregoing agreement, South Korea 
permanently stations about 14 guards and has built lookouts, 
barracks, concrete pillboxes and steel guard towers on 
Takeshima. During an October 1992 session of the South Korean 
National Assembly, Naval Chief of Staff Kim Chol-u revealed that 
a study is underway to install a radar base to cope with patrol 
ships of the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency. 
  The South Korean Government is dedicating itself to 
establishing a record of effective control over Takeshima by 
granting a fishing boat to a fisherman family which relocated to 
the island and implementing a forestation project. 
  In the meanwhile, Japan has no choice but to table issues 
concerning Takeshima before the South Korean Government. During 
the June session of the regular meeting of the Japan-South 
Korean conference, then-Foreign Minister Kabun Muto stated, 
"Takeshima is a territory of Japan from both historical and 
international law perspectives. It is very regrettable that it 
is occupied by South Korea." In response, South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu asserted, "Tok Do is inherently South 
Korean territory." 
  According to sources at the Northeast Asia Bureau of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese Government cannot 
allow itself to alter its assertion for territorial rights and 
it will continue to repeat its position no matter how much it 
offends the South Korean Government, thus causing the Japanese 
Government to refer to the Takeshima issue at each annual 
session of the regularly scheduled foreign ministers conference, 
but one cannot deny that the exchange is akin to a ceremony in 
which one side makes an assertion and the other side disregards 
what is said. 
<H5>  Possibilities for Peaceful Resolution Are Nil </H5>
  Relative to a peaceful resolution, Japan is unable to 
approach Takeshima which is its inherent territory and the 
continuing militarization of the island by South Korea 
demonstrates that it has no intention of becoming a party to 
peaceful settlement. Even Foreign Ministry officials admit, 
"Frankly, there is no prospect of a peaceful resolution." 
  According to government sources, it is probably true that, 
in 
reality, "territorial issues can be settled only through brute 
force. But, Japan does not possess that option nor do such 
measures have any significance." 
  However, the question arises, should Japan totally neglect 
an 
issue over which it has no meaningful countermeasure? Military 
sources point out, "The issue of the Senkaku Islands which China 
asserts is part of its territory could have a delicate effect on 
the Takeshima issue. The reason is that, if China should move to 
exercise effective control, Takeshima has demonstrated that 
Japan is unable to take any countermeasure." The same military 
source adds, "As long as Japan is unable to take countermeasures 
in response to the exercise of effective control, it must think 
in terms of how it can prevent the exercise of such control." 
  Captain Kanetomo points out, "The problem is that the 
Japanese people have very little awareness of land and sea- 
based territorial rights. One wonders how many people are aware 
that a Japanese island is being occupied." Takeshima which is 
about to be consigned to oblivion symbolizes the fragility of 
the national defense system.

  Footnote on Takeshima Takeshima is located 157 
kilometers northwest of Shimane Prefecture's Okishima and 
consists of two small islands called Higashijima and Nishijima 
and surrounding reefs. Total area is 0.23 square kilometers, 
about the size of Hibiya Park. It is known as a treasure trove 
of seafoods such as abalone and turbo. 
  In ancient Japanese history, Takeshima was known as 
Matsushima and was managed by the Otani and Kawamura families of 
the Hoki clan (Tottori) which had been granted the islands from 
Japan's feudal government during the initial stages of the Edo 
era. On the other hand, South Korean Government documents of the 
Rhee era in 1696 assert that a historical fact exists wherein An 
Yong-bok forced Japanese to evacuate from Takeshima. 
<H5>  Proposals by 200 Individuals To Change Japan </H5>
<H3>  Present to the General Public Options for Defense 
Capabilities </H3>
  Comments by Toshiyuki Shikata, Visiting Researcher, 
World Peace Research Center 
  Now that we have entered the post-cold war era, even nations 
which once relied on military force are attempting to abandon 
their reliance on physical force for pursuit of their national 
interests. These moves illustrate that other nations are 
following the example set by Japan. 
  However, the quantitative levels maintained by Japan for its 
defense capabilities are unparalleled in the world in terms of 
their ultra-pacifist characteristics. It is not feasible to make 
any quick reductions. I believe an appropriate defense 
capability would call for the elevation of current defense 
capabilities and efficiency and the attainment of a small-scale 
elite military force. 
  Military capabilities are maintained to cope with the 
unexpected and it is most ideal that they are never committed to 
actual use. 
  The Self-Defense Forces [SDF] are dedicated to training. As 
an example, gunnery technicians serving on combat tanks spend 
their time working to shorten the time required to launch a 
projectile when a target is detected. 
  However, SDF personnel face their severest professional test 
in observing the theory that non-use of defense capabilities is 
the ideal military situation. In other words, there is a need to 
give them the opportunity to show that their professions serve a 
meaningful purpose. Such opportunities are probably offered in 
connection with major natural disaster relief projects and UN 
peacekeeping operations (PKO). 
  However, I would like the general public to be aware that 
SDF 
personnel can serve effectively in emergencies only because they 
have been committed to routinely serve with honor and respect. 
They would be useless if they were treated without respect and 
as so much extraneous freight. 
  On the other hand, it seems that individuals among SDF 
personnel complain of their low ranking in society. But SDF 
personnel can enhance their societal standing only through their 
own efforts. 
  SDF personnel are strong collectively, but are very fragile 
when performing as individuals. It appears they suffer from the 
misconception that they lose their identity as individuals as 
part of a collective organization. 
  SDF personnel rarely take courses at evening extension 
courses at universities even when given the opportunity. 
Officers are given the opportunity to work for master's degrees 
at the graduate level. The ideal situation provides for the 
integration of capabilities as a group based on individual 
strengths. 
  As long as intelligence is made available at an early stage 
and reserves can be mobilized during emergencies, it would 
probably be acceptable to minimize peacetime military forces. 
However, if intelligence resources are available only on a 
minimal, delayed basis and emergencies must be encountered 
suddenly, we probably need to maintain a certain level of 
military capability even during peacetime. 
  We should probably ask the general public which option it 
wishes to choose. The government should explain the available 
defense formats and levels and allow the general public to 
select the appropriate option.

  [Text] South Korean Fishing Vessels Operate 
Illegally--Japanese Government Unable To Enforce Law 
  Fisheries cooperatives in Tsushima and Ikishima in Nagasaki 
Prefecture operate "protective patrol ships." The fisheries 
cooperatives operate independent patrols in self-defense because 
of the unending illegal operations of South Korean fishing 
vessels. 
<H5>  Situation Finally Produces Casualties </H5>
  "At the present time we are not operating protective patrol 
ships. South Korean fishing vessel operators know this and come 
to poach in our waters in droves. They took all of 300,000 
abalone that we had planted in the waters." 
  Shigeyoshi Inuzuka, age 48, chief of general affairs at the 
Nagasaki Prefecture Tsushima Fishing Cooperative located at the 
northern end of Tsushima, an island located near the 
international boundary, drooped his shoulders in dismay. South 
Korean fishing vessels violate the 12-nautical-mile (22 
kilometer) limit under cover of darkness and poach frequently in 
Japanese waters. 
  Yoshio Sawamura, chief of the Fisheries Policy Department of 
the Federation of Fishermen's Cooperatives comments, "The 
situation continues to worsen as over 90 percent of South Korean 
vessels take such actions as deliberately concealing their true 
identity." 
  According to figures confirmed by the Fisheries Agency, 
South 
Korean fishing vessels committed 1,181 violations as of the end 
of August this year, exceeding prior-year comparable-period 
figures by 170. Illegal operations include 1) violation of 
territorial waters, 2) violation of Japan-South Korean fisheries 
agreement, and 3) violation of Japan-South Korean Fisheries 
Independent Control Measures; 220 of the violations took place 
at Tsushima. 
  The Maritime Safety Agency has assigned two patrol ships and 
the Fisheries Agency has assigned one surveillance ship, but it 
is difficult to cover all of the coastline at Tsushima, which is 
about twice the size of Biwa Lake. 
  The Kamitsushima-cho Fisheries Cooperative initiated 
protective policies in 1985. However, on 25 July 1992, a 
much-feared casualty was recorded. 
  Before daybreak on that day, radar operated by the fisheries 
cooperative detected what appeared to be illegally operating 
South Korean fishing vessels four kilometers off Tsushima. 
Sixty-year-old Captain Takeyoshi Ogi of the six-ton protective 
patrol vessel Hayate operated by the fisheries cooperative moved 
immediately to the scene of the illegal operations. 
  The mission of the protective patrol ships is to quickly 
detect illegal operations of South Korean and Chinese fishing 
vessels and to report such violations to the Maritime Safety 
Agency. 
  At 0300 hours, Ogi informed the fisheries cooperative, "I am 
currently pursuing a large South Korean trawl-net fishing boat. 
The waves are beginning to grow higher." That was to be his last 
message. The Izuhara Maritime Safety Agency station at the 
southern tip of Tsushima dispatched the patrol ship Tatsugumo in 
response to information from the fisheries cooperative. However, 
the Hayate had already disappeared from the scene of the 
violations. 
  The Hayate was a small plastic boat and there was no way it 
could deal with a 150-ton trawl-net fishing boat. Concerned 
individuals gathered at the fisheries cooperative worried about 
Ogi's fate. At 0530 hours, a South Korean fishing vessel 
discovered the capsized, unmanned Hayate. 
  When towed to port by the South Korean vessel, the Hayate's 
propeller was so damaged that it retain none of its original 
shape. Captain Ogi is still unaccounted for. According to the 
Maritime Safety Agency, "There is a strong possibility that the 
propeller of the Hayate became entangled in the steel wiring 
released from South Korean fishing vessels during their 
high-seas operations." 
  According to the Nagasaki Prefecture Fisheries Department, 
protective vessels total six for Tsushima and Ikishima as a 
whole. In December 1993, the Kamitsushima-cho fisheries 
cooperative will replace the Hayate with a new eight-ton 
protective patrol vessel. 
<H5>  Living Together With Danger </H5>
  Department chief Inuzuka appeals for increased law 
enforcement, saying, "If we exercise vigilance through the use 
of protective patrol vessels, there is an undeniable decrease in 
poaching incidents. However, protective patrol vessels handle a 
dangerous mission." 
  "We have appealed to the South Korean Consulate in Fukuoka 
for corrective action, but we see no signs of improvement. We 
would like to see the South Korean Government appear at the 
scene of the violations to enforce the law." 
  The foregoing statement was made by the Japanese Government 
at the conference of director general of the Japan-South Korea 
Fisheries Ministries held at the Ministry of Agriculture, 
Forestry, and Fisheries at the end of August 1993. However, the 
South Korean Government simply replied, "We understand. However, 
the violations are limited in number." 
  The Maritime Safety Agency has the authority to apprehend 
fishing vessels that violate territorial waters. However, the 
agency, in reality, has pretty much thrown in the towel when it 
comes to fishing vessels violating the Japan-South Korea 
Fisheries Agreement. This agreement provides that, in 
extraterritorial waters, only law-enforcing ships of the 
violating ship's nation can enforce the law relative to such 
ships (principle of the ship's flag). According to the Maritime 
Safety Agency, the Japanese Government can only "take pictures 
of the violations and report them to South Korea." All we can do 
is wait for South Korean law-enforcement vessels to arrive on 
the scene. 
  In view of these circumstances, the Federation of Fisheries 
Cooperatives is holding a rally in Tokyo on 26 October to adopt 
a resolution seeking across-the-board enforcement of a 
200-nautical-mile territorial demarcation line. 
<H5>  Cautious About Establishing a Framework </H5>
  Currently, Japan has established a 200-nautical-mile 
fisheries zone, but has not applied this principle to waters 
around South Korea and China. When the 200-nautical-mile law was 
implemented in 1977, similar demarcations for the two countries 
were withheld because both nations had not established 
200-nautical-mile territorial rights and disputes were pending 
concerning territorial rights over Takeshima and Senkaku Islands. 
  The Federation of Fisheries Cooperatives seeks establishment 
of a new framework, saying, "Internationally, the 
200-nautical-mile system has become a routine matter and coastal 
nations control the situation based on their fisheries 
jurisdictional rights, but jurisdictional and law-enforcement 
rights relative to South Korea and China are limited to the 
respective territorial waters." Already, in the North Pacific 
region, Japan, the United States, Canada, and Russia have 
approved fisheries treaties and agreements in which mutual 
action is taken to inspect and capture vessels that engage in 
illegal operations. 
  However, according to the Fisheries Agency, "South Korea is 
cautious about forming a new framework." No effective 
countermeasure is available to Japan. 
  Department chief Inuzuka appeals, "The government should 
consider why it is necessary to operate protective patrol 
vessels." The existence of protective patrol vessels exposes the 
reality that the government is incapable of protecting the 
livelihood and safety of coastal fishermen.

<H5>  Fisheries Agreement </H5>
  The Japan-South Korea Fisheries Agreement was approved in 
1965 and provides that 1) coastal nations shall enforce the law 
up to 12 nautical miles from the shoreline of the nation 
concerned; 2) law enforcement in waters beyond the 12 nautical 
miles shall be handled by the nation with which the fishing 
vessel is registered (principle of ship's flag); and 3) mutual 
compliance shall be exercised relative to domestic regulations. 
Current independent regulatory measures are to be implemented 
between 1992 and December 1994. They include such measures as 
shortening the time allowed for operation of South Korean 
trawling vessels in waters off Hokkaido and establishment of 
zones off western Japan where South Korean trawl-net vessel 
operations will not be allowed and subjected to guidance and 
enforcement of the prohibition. Even the Japan-China Fisheries 
Agreement and measures to be taken in waters covered by the 
agreement as approved in 1975 are based on the principle of the 
ship's flag. There are no agreements that cover waters 
surrounding Japan. 
<H5>  Proposals by 200 Individuals To Change Japan </H5>
<H5>  It Is Only Logical To Protect One's Territorial Waters </H5>
  Comments by Shigeo Hiramatsu, Professor, Social Science 
Department, Kyorin University 
  Relative to China's efforts to increase its naval forces in 
recent years, there is the viewpoint in Japan that, "as a 
military force, they are still limited and do not pose a threat." 
  For sure, much of China's naval weaponry is outdated and 
lags 
in terms of technology, but the problem is that its naval forces 
are large enough to wage war on their own. In terms of 
antisubmarine patrol capabilities, the Japanese Maritime 
Self-Defense Force [MSDF] is top level, but cannot wage war 
because it lacks attack capabilities. 
  The Chinese Navy possesses attack weapons such as bombers, 
land combat units, and nuclear submarines. It poses a 
substantial threat to surrounding nations with limited military 
capabilities. 
  China asserts that all seas surrounding its continental 
regions are "Chinese seas." In the territorial waters law which 
it implemented in 1991, it declared that the Japanese territory 
known as the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea is Chinese 
territory. 
  China is using its naval power as a backdrop in making 
advances in the South China Sea. The South China Sea is part of 
Japanese sea lanes, where its tankers navigate on a daily basis. 
  However, the Japanese Government persists in assuming a 
passive stance. When China claimed the Senkaku Islands as part 
of its national territory, Japan merely lodged an oral protest. 
  Ever since 1991, repeated incidents have taken place in 
which 
Japanese fishing vessels have been attacked by unidentified 
ships which are believed to be of Chinese origin, but Japan has 
failed to take any effective countermeasure. 
  Such unidentified ships have also victimized merchant ships 
of Russian registry, but Russia has dispatched naval ships and 
have demonstrated that it will not hesitate to exercise military 
action if additional attempts are made at obstruction of safe 
navigation. The result of such Russian actions was that China 
apologized by admitting, "China was responsible for two of the 
four incidents." 
  If an appropriate protest is lodged, even China responds. It 
is very improper to take a weak position because, "We might 
offend the other party." There is a need to say that which is 
proper and demonstrate one's presence as a nation. 
  However, the Maritime Safety Agency is limited in its 
capabilities by the attitude that any deployment of the MSDF 
would violate the Constitution. As a result, no Japanese 
Government agency has the authority to control unidentified 
ships. Japan must first come to grips with this problem. 
  Seas encompassed by the 200-nautical-mile economic water 
zones cover 3.86 million square kilometers or close to 10 times 
Japanese national lands. The expanse equals an area which ranks 
seventh behind Russia. 
  It would be logical for Japan to protect those national seas 
in its role as a nation.

  [Text] Meiji Era Structures Remain--No Progress Made 
Because of Restraints on Defense Spending 
  This article pursues the situation at the SDF 
installation level. Defense expenditures are subject to an 
annual yearend debate on budget cuts, but the situation at the 
SDF installation level is a truly sad picture--one gets the 
impression that relevant officials have engaged in defense 
budget debates based on impractical theories in disregard of the 
real situation. 
<H3>  Over 30 Percent of Facilities Have Existed Since the Old 
Japanese Military Days </H3>
  Pre-World War II facilities still exist in the SDF. More 
than 
30 percent of the maintenance facilities and warehouses used by 
the GSDF were built by the former Japanese military forces. 
  In the evening of 5 January 1993, the GSDF 5th Division 
garrisoned at Obihiro-shi in northern Hokkaido was hit by major 
tremors of the 5.0 magnitude as part of the 7.8 magnitude 
tremors which centered around Kushiro Island. The earthquake was 
similar in intensity to the 7.9 magnitude tremor which hit 
during the Kanto plains quake of 1924. 
  Colonel Shuichi Ishii, 52, commander of the Obihiro Garrison 
Operations Unit, worried about whether the maintenance 
facilities and wooden buildings built 50 years ago could 
withstand the intensity of the tremors. Those facilities were 
converted from the former hangars and mess halls that were built 
in 1940 to house Japanese Air Force units. 
  Fortunately, no damage was suffered, but Colonel Ishii wore 
a 
complex expression as he confessed, "The old Japanese military 
structures were durable. If they had been destroyed, we would 
have had the opportunity to replace them." 
  SDF policy calls for demolition and replacement when wooden 
structures are 30 years old, and the age limit for concrete 
structures is 50 years, but, in reality, the situation reflects 
very little progress. Even in the area of living quarters, which 
enjoys the highest of priorities, nearly 60 percent or 2.11 
million square meters should be demolished and replaced, but 
only 36 percent will have been replaced by fiscal year 1993. 
  Maintenance facilities which are used to service the newest 
of equipment are comparatively new and have heating systems, but 
all others are scheduled for future replacement. Six percent of 
the facilities consist of buildings built during the Meiji era. 
  The vehicle maintenance facility that was an old Air Force 
hanger concerning which Colonel Ishii was worried in connection 
with the earthquake is used to inspect and maintain 150 pieces 
of self-propelled howitzers and trucks of the Fifth Artillery 
Regiment of the Fifth Division. It covers 3,600 square meters of 
floor space and is the largest such facility at that particular 
garrison. 
  Akira Takai, chief of the custodial branch of the Garrison 
Operations Unit sighs as he admits, "The only repair to the 
building was the replacement of the metal roofing in 1971. 
November during winter months in Obihiro brings -20 
Centigrade temperatures in the evening and mornings. But we 
don't have a heating system." 
  That situation forces the 70 or so maintenance personnel who 
work in the building to warm themselves at the single jet burner 
in the middle of the plant as they go about performing their 
maintenance tasks. 
  Maintenance personnel confess, "We wear gloves for warmth, 
but when we handle tiny precision parts we are forced to use our 
bare hands. In 30 minutes, our hands begin to freeze. We 
alternate between the jet heater and the work station. That 
means reduced efficiency and a higher exposure to the potential 
for accidents." 
  Another factor which exacerbates the battle with poor 
working 
conditions are the 10 pigeons that cohabit the building. The 
maintenance personnel work hard to polish and shine the 
equipment, but once they suffer a hit by "pigeon droppings" from 
the rafters, they have no choice but to repeat their polish and 
shine details. 
  Maintenance personnel explain, "We have mounted netting at 
the entrances to prevent the pigeon invasion, but we cannot 
avoid opening the doors during the day to bring sunlight and 
fresh air into the building." 
  The 5th Division has developed a plan to completely rebuild 
two-thirds of the maintenance facility and to install a heating 
system, but the cost would be 870 million yen. According to an 
officer of the unit, "We've pleaded for budget approval in 
fiscal year 1994, but there's no telling what will happen in the 
face of the defense spending restraints." 
  Growth in defense spending was limited to 3.8 percent in 
fiscal year 1992, the lowest level since fiscal year 1960, and 
it was cut further in fiscal year 1993 to 1.95 percent. 
  In December 1992, the Mid-Term Defense Program [MTDP] for 
fiscal years 1991-1995 totaling 22.75 trillion yen was reduced 
by about 580 billion yen to 22.17 trillion yen. The MTDP had 
placed greater emphasis on the construction of rear-area support 
systems such as living quarters for SDF personnel over frontline 
equipment such as combat tanks and destroyers. 
<H5>  Failure To Act May Lead to Personnel Shortages </H5>
  Estimated budget requests for defense spending approved in 
August 1993 for fiscal year 1994 reflect a 1.95 percent 
increase, the lowest level since the ceiling system was 
installed in 1961. 
  Moreover, since Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa issued a 
decision saying, "I ask that the growth in defense spending be 
restrained within the level approved for the initial fiscal year 
1993 budget," the JDA and SDF personnel were demoralized by a 
sense of frustration. The prime minister in the middle of 
August, stated in connection with the MTDP review by JDA key 
staff officials that, "I believe appropriate action is being 
taken in terms of the general public's viewpoint," and clearly 
enunciated his posture whereby defense spending cuts are a 
matter of basic policy. 
  Joint Staff Council Chairman Tetsuya Nishimoto at a luncheon 
with Prime Minister Hosokawa at the Prime Minister's Residence 
in the middle of September made a strong appeal for the manner 
in which SDF personnel of an invisible nature were quietly and 
assiduously engaged in training and the performance of duties, 
but there is no telling how well the prime minister appreciated 
his dissertation. 
  Midlevel officers of the 5th Division reveal, "There is the 
opinion that one must endure all situations as long as he is a 
member of the SDF, but such an attitude poses obstacles to 
personnel recruiting goals. There are plenty of jobs available." 
  One wonders how Prime Minister Hosokawa as the supreme 
commander of the SDF will reconcile defense budget restraints 
and national defense objectives. 
<H5>  Breakdown of Defense Spending </H5>
  Defense spending in fiscal year 1993 will total 4.6406 
trillion yen, representing 6.4 percent of the total general 
account fiscal spending budget. The breakdown includes 1) 42 
percent for personnel and subsistence, including personal pay 
and subsistence allowances; 2) 23 percent for equipment 
purchases such as combat tanks and destroyers; 3) 16 percent for 
maintenance expenses such as education and training; 4) 10 
percent for base countermeasures expenses such as support for 
U.S. Forces in Japan; 5) 4 percent for maintenance of 
facilities; and 6) 3 percent for research and development. The 
estimated budget for the next fiscal year will be 4.7311 
trillion yen, reflecting a cut of 17.9 billion yen to 900 
billion yen for frontline equipment such as combat tanks and a 
45.8 billion yen increase to 1.8290 trillion yen for rear-area 
equipment.

<H5>  A Japan-U.S. Framework for Security Is Indispensable </H5>
  Comments by Mr. Ryohei Oga, Former Chief of Staff, 
MSDF 
  Trends in Southeast Asia are of foremost concern in greeting 
the post-cold war period. Nations such as China and India can 
now easily obtain military equipment and are in the process of 
reinforcing their navies and air units. 
  However, Japan must coexist with the Southern nations in an 
amicable manner. How Japan does this is a matter of politics. 
  Ten years ago, a civilian symposium was held and an 
Indonesian researcher listed "threats from Southeast Asia." He 
mentioned domestic communism as the number-one concern; next was 
China which lurked in the background of domestic communism; 
third was the then-USSR; and fourth was rearmament by Japan. 
When I asked, "What do you mean by rearmament?" he replied, "A 
case in which Japan abandons the Japan-U.S. security arrangement 
and enters into rearmament after revising the Constitution." In 
response, a scholar from Thailand retorted, "We are now 
conducting a debate premised on the Japan-U.S. security 
arrangement. You are completely off track relative to your 
comments." 
  At that moment I became keenly aware of the fact that the 
Japan-U.S. security system served as a basic framework for 
actions by Japan. When one considers security for Southeast 
Asia, it is important that Japan continue to act within the 
framework of the Japan-U.S. system and that Japan confine itself 
to that framework. 
  What I wish to appeal here is that we give consideration to 
the very founding of our nation. The question arises, can we do 
without defense capabilities? No nation in the world can survive 
without such capabilities. All nations have a mobilization 
capability. If one were to question the mobilization 
capabilities of Japanese reserve SDF personnel, the matter would 
be problematic. Our nation has never given serious thought to 
this question. 
  Ever since the Yoshida cabinet days, the nation has given 
birth to the basic concept that we have a "military unit without 
combat capabilities" and "an SDF that is not a military unit." 
The Legislation Bureau of the cabinet stubbornly refuses to 
change these concepts. 
  Even though the JDA assumed a flexible posture in 
considering 
UN PKO activities, all efforts to coordinate with the 
Legislation Bureau ended in an argument of principles. It was 
even concluded about the use of weapons that they could be used 
only for self-defense and during emergency evacuation 
operations. The opinions of the Legislation Bureau were binding 
in all cases. 
  Although we should settle the argument about naval ships by 
merely saying, "SDF vessels are recognized as naval ships under 
international law," we end up with the interpellations saying 
that "SDF vessels are not naval ships." I believe the coalition 
government should engage in a thorough internal discussion 
concerning this situation. 
  However, I hope the Hosokawa government will not do that 
which is unnecessary. We will have problems even in connection 
with the review of the MTDP if a cabinet which partially refuses 
to recognize the SDF engages itself in the task.

World War II was a Navy lieutenant senior grade as a chief

Individuals To Change Japan 

<H5>    We Are Speaking of a Situation That Differs From Defense </H5>

Budget Cuts in Europe and the United States 
  Comments by Shigeru Hatakeyama, Administrative Vice 
Minister for Defense 
  Although we should not target a specific nation in 
formulating "basic defense capabilities," it is probably true 
that the former USSR served as the backdrop for developing the 
Defense Program Outline in 1976. 
  If one were to think that Japan no longer needs a defense 
system because of the collapse of the USSR, that is wrong. 
Rather, there is a proliferation of situations such as the 
modernization of the Far Eastern Russian Forces, development of 
nuclear capabilities and extension of missile ranges by North 
Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), and modernization 
of military forces in China, making a distinction among 
principal problem areas very difficult. 
  A situation whereby one is forced to develop capabilities to 
be responsive to a variety of situations makes for a rather 
difficult position. For a nation such as ours which was 
dedicated to a defensive posture, focusing on a single target 
was an easy matter. In the future, individual problem areas may 
be of a lesser magnitude, but we must concern ourselves with a 
greater number of problem areas. 
  We have already initiated a review of the Defense Outline, 
but I believe once the review is completed, we must next make a 
series of quantitative decisions. We are now in the process of 
formulating a new philosophy. 
  The United States, Great Britain, and Russia are in the 
process of reducing defense expenditures, but they are in the 
process of withdrawing from global roles and discarding that 
which has become extraneous, while Japan was never a part of the 
global pattern. It is a matter of considering the defense issue 
from a totally different perspective. The situation in Asia is 
such that there is no collective security arrangement and, 
exclusive of the Philippines, various nations are increasing 
their defense budgets by two-digit percentages. 
  Japan should probably continue into the future its policies 
relative to dedicated defensive systems, the three principles of 
nuclear weapons, and three principles on export of weapons as 
national policies, but defense of these pacifist principles will 
entail costs. 
  We must establish an intelligence system because production 
of weapons solely for domestic consumption is costly and because 
we are not permitted to initiate attacks. I believe those who 
need to be concerned are not aware of this fact. 
  The Gulf war served as one vehicle for deepening awareness 
of 
the SDF. We cannot overlook the fact that the debate surrounding 
the failed UN PKO bill had the effect of enhancing the general 
public's appreciation of the SDF. The SDF gained recognition 
both domestically and internationally for its role in executing 
the minesweeping operation and the UN PKO activities in 
Cambodia. Great reliance is placed on the SDF for operations in 
support of domestic disaster situations. 
  I believe the SDF will gain recognition for its efforts by 
gathering a record of executing such projects.

from the Law Department of Tokyo University and employed by the 
Ministry of Finance in 1961. Served as chief of the Research and 
Planning Department and as chief of the Tokyo Customs Office and

councilor, director of the Bureau of Personnel, director of the 
Bureau of Finance, and director of the Bureau of Defense Policy. 
Participated in legislative efforts on the PKO Cooperation Law 
which enabled overseas deployment of SDF units. Appointed to 
current position in June 1993.

  [Text] Demand for domestically produced reconnaissance 
satellites is rapidly growing in the Defense Agency [DA]. Since 
North Korea successfully conducted a test launching of its 
"Nodong-1" ballistic missile, which can directly hit Japan, the 
agency has been stressing the need for tools to keep track of 
North Korea's missile development. The agency is currently 
reviewing the "National Defense Program Outline" upon the 
request of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and is supposed to 
draft the revised outline by the end of this year. The new 
outline is expected to emphasize reinforcement of the nation's 
intelligence-gathering and analysis capability. Procurement of 
military satellites is difficult for Japan because a 1969 Diet 
resolution rules out the nation's development of space 
technology except for peaceful purposes. However, it appears 
that the agency thinks the prime minister may like the proposal 
for obtaining the satellites since he tends to attach importance 
to high-technology equipment. 
  Full-fledged reconnaissance satellite systems are currently 
possessed by only three nations -- the United States, Russia, 
and China. If Japan decides to build its own military 
satellites, neighboring nations would certainly react strongly 
to the decision. Even within the country, the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan, a coalition member, would strongly oppose such 
an attempt. 
  A reconnaissance satellite system should have ground 
facilities worth over 150 billion yen [Y], and three to four 
satellites, which would cost at least Y40-50 billion each. A 
senior Defense Agency official said: "Taking maintenance 
expenses into account, the satellite system would cost several 
hundred billion yen." Moreover, as the trail-blazing pioneer of 
space development, the United States may react negatively to 
Japan's attempts to develop its own space technology. Even in 
the Defense Agency, few people believe the plan can come to 
fruition easily. 
  The Defense Agency has already begun studying the political, 
technical, and financial problems involved in obtaining 
satellites within the 1990's. A senior official said: "In the 
next five-year defense buildup plan, which will begin in fiscal 
1996, we would like to advocate the need for Japan to obtain its 
own reconnaissance satellite, at the least." 
  The introduction of reconnaissance satellites has been an 
earnest desire of the Defense Agency, which aims at establishing 
Japan's own system for gathering and analyzing strategic 
information. At present, Japan depends to a large extent on the 
United States for military data on its immediate strategic 
environment. 
  In Diet interpellation in 1985, former Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro Nakasone expressed a positive stance toward Japan's 
obtaining its own reconnaissance satellites. At that time, 
however, the government could not further discuss tangible 
measures for obtaining the satellites due to the 1969 Diet 
resolution saying "Japan's development and use of space 
technology should be limited to peaceful purposes." However, 
the Defense Agency is seeking a breakthrough for obtaining 
satellites on the pretext of the government's 1985 statement 
that "it is possible for the Self-Defense Forces to use 
information provided by general-purpose satellites, such as 
weather satellites."

  [Text] Makoto Sakuma, former chairman of the Joint Staff 
Council and currently advisor to the Defense Agency [DA], spoke 
at a lecture in Tokyo on 19 January, indicating Japan needs to 
reexamine the current situation regarding the principle of 
civilian control. He said this needs to be done as part of an 
overall review of Japan's defense program which the government 
has embarked on, primarily focusing on a review of the "National 
Defense Program Outline" [NDPO]. Expressing his thoughts on the 
issue, Sakuma stated: "Basically, Self-Defense Force [SDF] 
officials should have control over unit operations and over 
educating and training personnel." Concerning studies on legal 
problems with regard to legislation for emergency situations, 
Sakuma added: "Japan should now begin sufficiently studying how 
it can cooperate indirectly with the U.S. military should an 
emergency occur on the Korean peninsula." 
  On 1 January Sakuma became the first among former SDF 
officers to be appointed a DA advisor at the recommendation of 
Shigeru Hatakeyama, administrative vice minister of the DA, and 
others. He is also considered to be one of the favorable 
candidates for a panel which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
plans to establish for reviewing the NDPO. Consequently, his 
remarks are expected to create a stir. 
  Concerning civilian control, Sakuma said: "There were valid 
reasons when the two laws on defense (DA Establishment Law and 
SDF Law) were enacted, so it could not be helped." However, he 
insisted the SDF should have control over its own operations, 
saying: "There should be both a military command and a military 
administration." He also stressed role-sharing, adding: "The DA 
(internal division) would take care of administrative duties 
related to defense and act as a contact point with politics." 
  In connection with studies regarding legislation for 
emergency situations, Sakuma pointed out that "a situation where 
only Japan would be attacked is inconceivable." On the premise 
of a military confrontation on the Korean peninsula, Sakuma 
stressed: "Since Japan and the ROK would be involved, Japan 
cannot remain idle if the United States responds to the 
situation. We are at a time when it is necessary to conduct 
preparatory studies on emergency situations which may develop 
outside of Japan." Concerning collective defense, Sakuma said: 
"I do not object to it, but I feel it is necessary to cut 
current restrictions to a reasonable level." 
  Regarding the Japanese-U.S. Security Treaty, Sakuma cited 
the 
issue of a "one-sided alliance," saying: "So far the SDF has 
concentrated on building its own defense capabilities, but now 
it has become important to use such capabilities correctly. It 
ought to be that Japan can support the U.S. military." He thus 
stressed the need to conclude an agreement with the United 
States on having Japan provide logistic support and labor for 
which the United States would pay. 
  Sakuma summarized his recommendations as follows: 1) 
reexamine the two laws on defense; 2) expand studies on legal 
problems with regard to legislation for emergency situations; 
and 3) formulate regulations governing the action of SDF. 
Concerning review of the NDPO, Sakuma said: "If a valid system 
were to be established regarding mobilization during emergencies 
and reserve forces, I believe active manpower can be cut back in 
times of peace. However, it is important to strengthen the SDF 
so it can exist independently in its own right." 
  Sakuma held his lecture at a meeting of the "Japan National 
Defense Association" -- a foundation under DA jurisdiction -- 
with former Soichiro Ito, former DA director general, as 
chairman. Among the audience were DA officials and senior SDF 
officials.

<F P=106> ["Ronten [point at issue]" column by Hisahiko Okazaki, </F>
former Japanese ambassador to Thailand: "Requests Concerning 
the Revision of the National Defense Program Guidelines] 
  [Text] The most important thing in reviewing the National 
Defense Program Guidelines is "not to do anything harmful to 
patients" as stated by the great Greek doctor Hippocrates. 
Also, the following saying by Yaritsu Sozai, a Mongolian 
premier in the 1200's, may teach us something: "You have to 
remove one harmful thing to gain an advantage. You have to stop 
doing one thing to start doing another thing." 
  The present guidelines have the most serious defects in 
situation assessment and strategic ideas. Although they should 
be flexible and be adapted to circumstances, there are only 
fixed assessment and strategic ideas in Japan because of a rule 
that defense matters should be decided on by the cabinet. 
  From the beginning, the situation assessment and strategic 
ideas have been merely nominal. 
  A U.S. military expert once said: "Japan's defense program 
guidelines do not mention any strategies placing military 
importance on the north. Has Japan reviewed the guidelines?" 
Without answering the question, Japan steadily built a system 
to defend the northern part of Japan. By the mideighties, it 
gained confidence that it could repel foreign aggression in 
cooperation with the United States. 
  At that time, no one paid attention to the idea demonstrated 
in the guidelines that Japan should repel an aggression on its 
own at the initial stage, and wait for U.S. help. Instead, an 
operational plan was formulated on the assumption that Japan and 
the United States jointly defend the nation against an attack by 
the Soviet Union. 
  A clause in the guidelines says that Japan should maintain 
basic defense power in peacetime and should expand it when 
necessary. In actuality, however, nobody expects that the 
defense power will be expanded in accordance with this clause. 
Working-level officials all know that the thinking that there 
should be enough time to compile a new defense budget even when 
a crisis is imminent is far from realistic. They know that 
because this is the time all the world is seeking peace, it is 
impossible for Japan to expand its military power based on the 
defense program guidelines even if a crisis is imminent. In 
fact, the guidelines do not explain when the expansion is 
possible and what the procedures are. Also, both Japanese and 
U.S. Government defense officials are thinking only of defending 
Japan with the existing military strength. 
  In this context, ideas demonstrated in the defense program 
guidelines are merely words. However, this has not caused 
actual harm. The only harm is the rule saying that the Cabinet 
should decide defense matters. This rule prevents the 
development of strategic ideas. 
  Because there are not many strategists in Japan, this nation 
has to depend on working-level Defense Agency officials for 
defense ideas. However, the adoption of their ideas is limited 
because of the aforementioned rule, and this has caused 
incalculable harm. Although we Japanese waged the Pacific war, 
we did not learn strategies from it. We also failed to learn 
strategic ideas from the Cold War, although we fought it 
throughout. 
  From now on, the government should try to avoid deciding on 
situation assessment and strategic ideas at the cabinet level. 
It is desirable that it allow changes in defense ideas and show 
the changes in annual defense white papers as other 
industrialized nations do. 
  If the government needs to continue deciding on defense 
matters at the cabinet level, it should adopt realistic defense 
policies (as other countries do) in line with the Japanese-U.S. 
alliance, or it should adopt slogan-like policies which cite 
ideas in Article 9 of the Constitution and can be flexibly 
interpreted. 
  Revising the table attached to the guidelines is the 
centerpiece of the review of the defense program guidelines. 
When the government revises the table, it should seek the 
counsel of experts, especially of working-level officers in the 
Self Defense Forces [SDF]. This is the most important. In that 
instance, the government, with high political judgment, should 
take two things into consideration. 
  One is that after making sure the SDF officers' advice is 
not made based on the interests of each force, the government 
should come up with an all-around judgment for the nation and 
the security of the Japanese people. 
  The other is that it should consider avoiding a situation in 
which Japan falls behind the progress in military technology and 
changes in defensive tactics as a result of its adherence to 
conventional ideas, such as a big-battleship-and-cannon-ism this 
nation once advocated. 
  Since the Gulf war, military authorities in the world have 
opened their eyes wide to the power of advanced technology. 
Some countries have drastically reviewed their defense systems. 
Taking this into consideration, the SDF should also actively 
introduce advanced technology in their defense plans. They 
should not be satisfied with their already-high-level technology. 
  Based on this idea, the government should calculate entire 
defense expenditures. It should not intend to cut the defense 
budget from the beginning. 
  The argument that the defense budget should be cut "because 
the world is moving toward arms reduction" rests on slender 
authority. The military balance surrounding Japan, which 
influences the security of this nation, is changing. Other 
Asian nations are expanding their armaments, and the military 
power of the Russian Army in the Far East has greatly been 
enhanced over the past 10 years. It is meaningless to compare 
Japan's defense budget with those of the United States and 
Europe, where the threat of Warsaw Pact forces composed of more 
than 100 divisions has gone and the threat of Russia has 
diminished. 
  The Far East region is facing many issues seen in a 
transitional period. They include those concerning the DPRK's 
alleged nuclear arms development, who will succeed President Kim 
Il-song, North-South unification, who will succeed Chinese 
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, long-range plans to strengthen 
military power, Taiwan-related matters, and the fluid political 
situation in Russia. It will take at least 10 years to know how 
these issues will be settled. 
  The most important thing in a transitional period is not to 
launch policies that will prevent flexible defense plans for 
many years. As Yaritsu Sozai says, Japan has to remove one 
harmful thing (to eliminate meaningless ideas from the present 
defense program guidelines) to gain one advantage.

  [Text] The Industrial Science and Technology Agency of the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] and the 
Superconducting Technology Research Institute [STRI; name as 
published] have decided to start a project to develop 
superconducting IC's (integrated circuits) for terabit 
communications, which will make it possible to increase by 1,000 
times the amount of data transmitted through fiber optics. The 
decision was made following STRI's success in developing an 
experimental high-temperature superconducting IC. They plan to 
start this project in fiscal 1995. Technology for very 
high-speed optical communications, the area in which Japan lags 
behind the United States, is the key to realizing a multimedia 
society. MITI hopes to catch up with the United States in this 
area through the development of superconducting ICs. 
  Technology for terabit communications enables one fiber 
optical cable to have a capacity equal to that of more than 15 
million telephone lines, or to that of 30,000 wires for 
high-definition television images. It is expected that if 
terabit communications eventuate, the cost of communications 
will drop to almost zero and multimedia businesses such as 
interactive visual and data communications will bloom. 
  Lasers for optical communications have a high frequency of 
more than 200 terahertz. This makes it theoretically possible 
to transmit 1 terabit of data through fiber optics, but in 
actuality the amount of data that can be transmitted through 
optical communications is limited to about 1 gigabit. 
Similarly, the amount of data that can be transmitted through 
the information superhighway which the U.S. Government is trying 
to develop is no more than 10 gigabits. 
  The higher the transmission speed, the greater the 
electrical 
resistance inside receiver semiconductors. This makes it 
difficult to receive the data transmitted and is the reason for 
the limited amount of transmission data. STRI turned its 
attention to a superconducting element whose electrical 
resistance was almost zero, and succeeded last autumn in 
developing an experimental superconducting IC made of 
high-temperature superconducting material. The development of 
such an IC was the first in the world. 
  This experimental IC has a simple structure. It is made of a 
superconducting antenna and six Josephson junction devices. The 
STRI has confirmed that the IC is capable of receiving a 
23-gigahertz high frequency electric wave. STRI Director Shoji 
Tanaka said if the integration of the IC is raised, it would 
become possible to transmit and receive 100 gigabits or 1 
terabit of data.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, January 21 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- On the 
scent [as received] of the statement, which he made in December 
20, 1993, when he was the head of the counterintelligence 
service of the state security central department, about 
involvement of some state high officials in bribery and abuse of 
powers Colonel L. Sanjaasuren made public some concrete 
information today at the press conference, which was held here. 
The press conference was organized by the newspaper "IL 
TOBCHOO" at the request of the exchief of the 
counterintelligence. 
  As the colonel announced, in the course of eight months as a 
chief of the counterintelligence he has got acquainted with 
information concerning the State Great Hural chairman, the 
deputy chairman of the parliament and the prime minister. As he 
said, the parliament Chairman N. Bagabandi had a meeting, which 
was not fixed anywhere neither in the protocol service of the 
Ministry for External Relations, the parliament nor in the 
security office, with the director on the Chinese part of the 
Mongolian-Chinese company "Tuuljing Pang", which has a bad 
reputation among the population, at the state residence, not 
resorting to the help of an interpreter and without a witness. 
After this meeting the Chinese director has informed his chief 
that Bagabandi promised to render support on his part. 
  During the discussion of arguments, which has arisen between 
the Mongolian and the Chinese partners around 9 mln [million] 
tugriks, and solution of this issue Bagabandi's wife has been 
behind the doors and was coming in the room from time to time 
and going out together the Chinese director of the company. 
[sentence as received] 
  Concerning the Prime Minister P. Jasray, the former head of 
the counterintelligence informed that he has a direct concern 
with the export of Hong Kong goods with a forged label "made in 
Mongolia" to the American market, and that he has been putting a 
word for admission of a Chinese citizen to the Mongolian 
citizenship, that he has given an instruction to stop 
investigation of the information about illegal crossing of air 
border of Mongolia by a helicopter "Mi-6", which has landed at 
the airport of the Mongolian capital. The prime minister's 
grownup children are engaged in commercial activity, including 
export of metal, which is banned by law. The spouse of the 
prime minister has received a great amount of yuan from a 
Chinese citizen, Inner Mongol Ulziihutag in the city of Uhan 
[place-name as received]. 
  The Mongolian premier, after receiving 10000 US dollars from 
the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party leader B. 
Dash-Yondon, has spent this sum on buying goods in South Korea 
and sold them in China. 
  Besides that, L. Sanjaasuren made public also information 
about the parliament deputy chairman, his activity as the 
president of the society "Mongol Aduu" ("Mongolian Horse"). 
  The colonel also made public the following information. By 
personal order of the Vice Premier C. Purebdorj 195 thousand US 
dollars in cash have been delivered from the Trade and 
Development Bank to two persons' the vice president of 
Mongolbank O. Chuluunbat has sold osmium in Germany, soon after 
which 50 thousand US dollars have been received on the account 
of the bank. The central police department of Mongolia on the 
pretext of a diplomatic load has taken out of the country the 
(red) mercury, which has been confiscated from Mongolian 
citizens, with the prime minister's permission. 
  This department has also sold (red) mercury to two Iranian 
citizens. 
  L. Sanjaasuren also announced that during his performing the 
duties of the chief of the counterintelligence up to 25 
December, 1993, no information was received by his department 
about the State Great Hural members, representatives of the 
opposition parties in the parliament D. Ganbold and S. Zorig.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and 
North Korea will hold a series of working-level contacts during 
this week in a bid to discuss a final-stage compromise to narrow 
the two sides' opinion difference over the inspection method and 
scope. Under a policy to complete the issue of resuming the 
inspections of North Korea's facilities as soon as possible, The 
IAEA is accelerating a final-stage compromise to remove 
stumbling blocks through a series of working-level contacts with 
North Korea or through the delivery of documents. 
  The IAEA did not hold a working-level contact with North 
Korea yesterday, 25 January. Instead it arranged the IAEA's 
position on the problems revealed at the 24 January 
working-level contact as an official document and delivered it 
to the North Korean side. 
  IAEA Spokesman David Kyd revealed that since the IAEA urged 
the North Korean side to accept full-scope inspections of the 
seven nuclear facilities on 19 January, opinion difference 
between the two sides has been somewhat narrowed, thus a little 
progress has been made. He stressed that he expects that if a 
series of contacts is held in the future, the stumbling block 
factor will be completely removed. 
  Spokesman Kyd's remarks are analyzed as while reaffirming 
the 
IAEA's position on full-scope inspections of the two key nuclear 
facilities, the IAEA is assuming a flexible attitude toward the 
working-level negotiations over the inspection method and scope. 
  In the meantime, diplomatic sources in Vienna pointed out 
that even though inspections can be conducted early if a final 
compromise succeeds, considering the recent North Korean Foreign 
Ministry statement, it is early yet to have an optimistic 
thought.

<F P=106> [By Cho Se-hyon] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 26 (YONHAP) -- As talks between North 
Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 
nuclear inspection are making slower progress than expected, 
senior South Korean Government officials are expressing concern 
that the negotiations may break up. 
  Both the United States and South Korea had expected the 
North 
Korea-IAEA talks to proceed smoothly, if not rapidly, because of 
the hopeful note sounded by the North Korean-U.S. working 
level-contacts in New York last month. But as the North 
Korean-IAEA negotiations go nowhere session after session, 
senior U.S. and South Korean officials are running out of 
patience and becoming increasingly restless. 
  Reflecting their feelings, perhaps, Washington and Seoul 
urged Pyongyang in recent days to accept IAEA inspection of its 
nuclear facilities and warned that time is running out for North 
Korea. 
  South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Tuesday that 
a decision will be made in two to three weeks by the United 
States on whether it will hold dialogue with North Korea. 
  Han's remark, made at a public gathering, was seen by many 
as 
an indication that the situation has indeed become serious since 
Han represents the body of opinion that was counseling continued 
dialogue for a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  The time frame of "two to three weeks" was apparently 
mentioned with the Feb. 21 IAEA Board of Governors' meeting in 
mind. The foreign minister must have been aware also of North 
Korean "dear leader" Kim Chong-il's birthday (Feb. 16) when he 
made the remark. 
  Han was understood to have hinted that the North Korean 
nuclear problem has to be brought to the United Nations Security 
Council unless IAEA inspection is carried out in two to three 
weeks. 
  Given the time for the IAEA to prepare for inspection, Han 
appeared to be stressing that North Korea and the IAEA could not 
keep holding fruitless negotiations for much longer. 
  Many questions are being asked in Vienna, Washington and 
Seoul as to why the North Korean-IAEA talks were not making any 
progress, but few clear answers were emerging. 
  Judging by the statements made by responsible officials so 
far, the main cause for disputes between Pyongyang and the IAEA 
stems from the fact that the United States and North Korea 
concluded their working-level contacts without firmly spelling 
out the type and scope of the IAEA inspection on seven reported 
North Korean facilities. 
  North Korea is said to be arguing with the IAEA, questioning 
the connection between the IAEA's demand for an inspection of 
all seven reported facilities and maintaining continuity for 
nuclear safeguards. 
  At any rate, no one is sure why North Korea is delaying its 
agreement with the IAEA as Pyongyang has nothing to gain by its 
actions. 
  The prevailing opinion among South Korean Government 
officials is that North Korea is reluctant to agree to the IAEA 
inspection because of "internal necessity," or because it wants 
to squeeze more concessions from the United States. 
  Others speculate that North Korea cannot afford to "use up 
all of its nuclear cards" by accepting IAEA ad hoc and routine 
inspections before it has managed to obtain a U.S. nod for the 
establishment of diplomatic ties between Pyongyang and 
Washington. 
  As for those who advance the theory of "internal necessity," 
they say North Korea might be taking its time to persuade 
hardliners, especially the military, to accept outside 
inspection. 
  By delaying negotiations with the IAEA, they say, Pyongyang 
probably wants to boast, both at home and abroad, that it did 
not succumb to foreign pressure and thus was able to obtain U.S. 
agreements to suspend the Team Spirit military exercise with the 
South and to hold a third round of high-level talks with 
Washington for improvement of bilateral relations. 
  Those who argue that North Korea does not want to use its 
nuclear card believe that Pyongyang is delaying its negotiations 
with the IAEA in order to wrench from it as many concessions as 
possible, while leaving unresolved questions for the third round 
of U.S.-North Korean high-level talks. 
  Although South Korean officials watching the developments 
are 
running out of patience, they could still be described as being 
"guardedly optimistic about the outcome of the North Korea-IAEA 
talks," for they know it is North Korea's style to always push 
an issue to the brink before making a dramatic turnaround at the 
last moment.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Issue and `North Korea's </F>
Internationalization'"] 
  [Text] North Korea and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA] have been holding discussions on the scope and 
method of nuclear inspection to confirm any changes in the 
status of North Korea's nuclear facilities [pukhan 
haekhyonhwang]. This is a precondition to holding the third 
round of talks between North Korea and the United States for 
resolving the nuclear issue. 
  In order to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, the 
United States has insisted upon, first of all, the continuity of 
IAEA inspections; second, making North Korea accept inspections 
of its two unreported facilities at the third round of talks; 
and, finally, leading North Korea to abandon its nuclear policy 
through its internationalization. 
  Meanwhile, North Korea has tried to improve relations with 
the United States and other advanced capitalist countries to 
overcome difficulties in maintaining its own system. Towards 
that end, North Korea has tried to use its nuclear card to the 
utmost in optimizing relations with the United States and other 
advanced capitalist countries to the most of its abilities. 
  Given these conflicts of interest, unless North Korea 
changes 
its policy fundamentally, the North Korea-U.S. talks will likely 
be prolonged and North Korea's denuclearization will only be 
possible through North Korea's "perestroyka" [previous word in 
English]. 
  Therefore, the short-term and tentative way to resolve the 
North Korean nuclear issue is to make every effort in 
negotiations to conduct thorough nuclear inspections, and the 
long-term and ultimate way is to make North Korea realize that 
embarking on a "road of internationalization" is a better way to 
maintaining its system than embarking on a "road of 
chuche-orientation" by formulating an international assistance 
program. 
  It is almost impossible for the current North Korean 
political leaders to abandon the "road of chuche-orientation" 
because this would mean the collapse of their system. However, 
insisting on the road of chuche-orientation in a world of 
internationalization, will only invite the danger of the 
collapse of the North Korean system. Therefore, to lead North 
Korea to pursue the maintenance of its system by carrying out a 
policy of internationalization, we must contemplate the 
formation of an international assistance program at some 
appropriate time in the future that can make North Korea see 
that in reality, "perestroyka" will help boost its system. 
  When our government's initiative and close cooperative 
system 
with the United States, Japan, and other advanced capitalist 
countries and international agencies results in an assistance 
program to accelerate North Korea's "perestroyka," we will then 
be able to realize our dream of denuclearizing the Korean 
peninsula.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 26 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government will not approve the move of South and North Korean 
Chondogyo [Chondoist] organizations to have a contact to discuss 
the possible joint sponsorship of ceremonies marking the 
centenary of the Donghak peasants revolution. 
  "Any visit to the South by North Korean Chondogyo officials 
and a South-North Chondogyo contact to discuss the visit are not 
permissible," a National Unification Board official said on 
Tuesday. He said such a move runs counter to the government 
policy of withholding all travels back and forth between the two 
sides due to the nuclear issue. 
  The central headquarters of Chondogyo, an indigenous 
religious organization, formally asked the unification board 
earlier in the day to send to the North its reply that they had 
accepted the North Korean Chondogyo proposal to have a 
working-level contact at Panmunjom on Feb. 3. 
  In a telephone message to the South's Chondogyo on Jan. 24, 
Yu Mi-yong, guidance chairman of the North Korean Chondogyo, 
offered to have a working-level contact at Panmunjom.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 26 (YONHAP) -- Seoul has asked 
Washington not to extend the visa of former presidential aide 
Kim Chong-hwi nor grant him permanent residentship, Vice Foreign 
Minister Hong Sun-yong said Wednesday. 
  "We requested that the United States be prudent in extending 
his visa or giving him residentship in consideration of the fact 
that Kim once served in diplomacy and national security and that 
he is implicated in an irregularity," Hong said. 
  Washington formally confirmed Wednesday morning that Kim has 
applied for permanent residentship. 
  "It was a preliminary confirmation," he said. "It's 
preliminary because Washington has not given any details other 
than that Kim has applied, such as where or how he applied." 
  Seoul officials say they do not know Kim's whereabouts. The 
former top presidential secretary for diplomacy and national 
security left for the United States last April as a guest 
researcher at the Heritage Foundation. 
  He has virtually been in hiding since reports in Seoul that 
he took bribes from lobbyists selling arms to Korea for its 
Yulgok (military modernization) project. 
  Hong suggested Seoul could go beyond seeking U.S. refusal of 
residentship, commonly called a "green card," saying his 
ministry will have to consult with the Justice Ministry on 
whether to make additional requests to Washington. 
  Sources said that one possible request would be to have the 
Americans investigate Kim. 
  Washington officials told Seoul via the South Korean Embassy 
that they will take Kim's case into consideration and make a 
prudent decision after internal consultation. 
  "There are many legal aspects to consider," Hong said. "The 
decision will take time."

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Chong Pyong-chin: "Three Ways for the </F>
United States `To Deal With the Kim Chong-hwi Case'"] 
  [Text] Our attention is now focused on the U.S. 
Government's official response to the request for "political 
asylum" made by the former senior presidential secretary for 
foreign and national security affairs. It was learned that our 
government made unofficial contacts with the U.S. Government on 
several occasions in connection with former senior Secretary Kim 
Chong-hwi's "request for political asylum," but the contacts 
continued only a tug-of-war over the interpretation of his 
present status, whether he is a public official or a private 
individual. 
  On 22 January, however, our government requested the U.S. 
Government to give its official response to this matter and, at 
the same time, informed it of our position "opposing the 
granting of permanent residency" to him. The U.S. Government is 
expected to make a final decision on this matter sooner or later. 
  In this connection, an official concerned at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs said on 22 January that "there have been 
`complicated and delicate differences of views' between the ROK 
and U.S. Governments over the matter on whether former senior 
Secretary Kim Chong-hwi's request for permanent residency is a 
simple request to extend his private stay in the United States 
or an official request to seek political asylum," adding that 
"now that we have delivered our official position to the United 
States, the U.S. Government is expected to inform our government 
of its opinion and its measures." 
  There are three basic ways the U.S. Government can respond 
to 
our government. First, the United States can take considerably 
stern measures on former senior Secretary Kim, who is a figure 
of the Sixth Republic, in consideration of the friendly 
relations existing between Presidents Kim Yong-sam and Clinton. 
Second, the United States can protect him because he was a 
"witness" to the arms dealings between the ROK and the United 
States. Finally, the United States can regard this case as a 
matter of the Office of Immigration and refer it to this office, 
based on the experiences attained in the close-door negotiations 
held thus far with the ROK Government. 
  Stern measures by the U.S. Government against former senior 
Secretary Kim Chong-hwi are precisely what our government has 
openly demanded. His departure from the U.S. Heritage Foundation 
no longer allows him to stay in the United States legally. 
Therefore, he can no longer stay in the United States and has 
to leave even though his passport and visa are valid for four 
more years. As a result of this, the United States will have to 
face complaints from numerous "non-Americans" residing in the 
United States. 
  Relevant Foreign Ministry officials foresee no signs of the 
United States actively protecting former Senior Secretary Kim. 
Their reason is that if the United States take measures to 
protect former Senior Secretary Kim, it will stir up unpleasant 
memories in the ROK of the Kim Hyong-uk exile case and will 
directly spark not only diplomatic friction but also anti-U.S. 
sentiments, which have died down since the inauguration of the 
civilian government. In an attempt to prevent "discord" with 
the ROK Government while avoiding "discomfort" internally, the 
U.S. Government is expected to state openly that "it is 
difficult to intervene in the issue at the government level." 
  While noting through unofficial channels, the inevitability 
of assuming an "equivocal attitude," it has been learned that 
the U.S. Government, in fact has been hesitating due to our 
government's repeated calls against granting permanent residency 
to former Senior Secretary Kim on the grounds that "domestic 
public sentiment makes it difficult to accept." Nevertheless, 
the United States continues to explain that "rather than being 
subject to government approval, permanent residency is granted 
almost automatically when requirements are met." 
  At all events, the United States is now in a position of 
having to make a decision on former Senior Secretary Kim soon. 
It cannot continue to procrastinate on this "hot potato." It 
will be worth noting how our government, as well as the U.S. 
Government, handles this issue of former Senior Secretary Kim's 
"seeking refuge in the United States" because it is a very 
delicate one involving the domestic laws of the two countries, 
the international judicial cooperation treaty, and public 
sentiment in both countries.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States are positively considering deploying Patriot 
missiles at American bases to counter North Korea's Scud 
missiles, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said Wednesday. 
  "Negotiations are under way between the two countries," Hong 
said. "As to the size and time of deployment, decisions will be 
made after further consultations." 
  South Korea will not be purchasing the Patriots, the vice 
foreign minister said, the anti-missile defense system will be 
part of the weaponry deployed by the U.S. Forces in Korea at 
their bases here. 
  Though officials deny it, the decision is likely to 
negatively affect the stalemated nuclear negotiations with North 
Korea. 
  "The threat of North Korean missiles is very real," Hong 
said. "We hope that the deployment (of Patriot missiles) will 
enhance South Korea-U.S. defense capability." 
  The idea of importing the Patriot system has been on the 
table ever since its celebrated success against Iraqi Scud 
missiles during Desert Storm, but some military experts are 
questioning its accuracy and effectiveness, insisting that the 
defensive missiles are already outmoded. 
  North Korea is believed to have upgraded the Soviet Scud in 
its Nodong-1 missile, making it nuclear-capable with a 1,000 km 
range. 
  The stalinist state sent shudders through South Korea and 
Japan when it successfully test-fired a Nodong missile last 
summer. 
  Hong said the negotiations will be handled by the defense 
ministries of the two countries.

  [Text] Washington, Jan. 25 (YONHAP) -- U.S. defense 
budget cuts have caused a vital question of survival to Korean 
Air's aircraft repair and maintenance depot in Kimhae near 
Pusan, informed sources said on Monday. The U.S. Government 
formally informed Seoul in late December that it had decided to 
stop using Korean Air's Kimhae depot in the repair and 
maintenance of U.S. Air Force aircraft operating in the Pacific 
and the Far East. 
  The South Korean Government responded with a request that 
the 
U.S. Government reconsider the decision in view of security 
cooperation between the two countries, but it is unlikely that 
the U.S. Government will comply with the South Korean request 
because of the U.S. industry's lobbying for buy-American policy, 
sources said. 
  Korean Air built the depot in question in 1976 chiefly for 
the repair and maintenance of U.S. Air Force aircraft, as the 
U.S. Government, severing diplomatic relations with Taiwan for 
rapprochement with mainland China, wanted Korea to provide 
repair and maintenance services to its Air Force in the Pacific 
and the Far East. Until then Taiwan had provided the services. 
The depot, employing 700 workers, has once accounted for a 
maximum 75 percent of the turnover of Korean Air's aircraft and 
space department. 
  A source close to Korean air said that although some 
quarters 
of the U.S. Government want to continue using Kimhae depot for 
the U.S. Air Force in preparation for an emergency, it would be 
very hard for the U.S. Government as a whole to change its mind 
because it is under heavy pressure of the U.S. aircraft 
maintenance industry. 
  The U.S. Government is considering transferring the repair 
and maintenance services for U.S. Air Force aircraft in the 
Pacific and the Far East from Korean Air's Kimhae depot to an 
aircraft maintenance center in Georgia state which is now on the 
verge of bankruptcy.

  [Text] (Yakovlev), director of the Korean peninsula 
affairs department in the Russian Foreign Ministry, revealed 
yesterday that from this year, Russia will make all efforts to 
prompt North Korea to pay back its debts. 
  In an interview with a Moscow broadcast yesterday, 
(Yakovlev) 
revealed that Russia would fully discuss with North Korea the 
issue of revising their treaty, including the issue of economic 
cooperation. In particular, he said that the issue of North 
Korea's debts which amounted to over three billion rubles in 
1990, will be adjusted. 
  In addition, in connection with North Korea's nuclear issue, 
(Yakovlev) said that Russia absolutely opposes the artificial 
proliferation of nuclear weapons and opposes the presence of 
nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. He stressed that to 
prevent the presence of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula, 
all regulations, which have been reached between North Korea and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency, should be strictly 
observed.

<F P=106> [Report by Pak Ui-chun on interview with Kim Sok-kyu, ROK </F>
ambassador to Russia, with unidentified reporters; date and 
place not given] 
  [Text] "I am sorry to see that the ROK public is negative 
and critical about Russia and it has a tendency to disdain 
Russia ever since the pending issues, including the economic 
cooperation loan, were brought into the fore after the fervor 
and bubbles of the early stage of amity burst." 
  Kim Sok-kyu, ROK ambassador to Russia, who made a temporary 
home visit on 22 January to discuss state affairs with his 
headquarters after 10 months in his position, said it is 
important to correctly perceive Russia and stressed that the ROK 
should further strengthen diplomacy toward Russia in the 
direction whereby Russia can be secured as a support force in 
reunification and security. 
  Following are questions posed to and answers given by 
Ambassador Kim: 
  [Reporter] How are things in Russia these days? 
  [Kim] After the new parliament was formed, the conservatives 
and communists launching the congress became more notable than 
expected because radical reformers had hurt various classes, 
such as the unemployed and beneficiaries of the pension system. 
It will take two years before the situation in Russia 
stabilizes. However, there will be no change in Russia's policy 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  [Reporter] How do you assess the Russian Government's recent 
proposal of supplying, and jointly developing and manufacturing 
weapons? 
  [Kim] The issue on the military exchanges between the two 
countries is an issue to be examined on a long-term basis and, 
in my personal opinion, it is worthwhile reviewing. The reason 
the Russian Government made such a proposal is that there is no 
other way for Russia to reimburse the economic cooperation loan. 
  [Reporter] How efficient are the Russian weapons? 
  [Kim] They should be deemed highly efficient, taking into 
account that Russia once competed with the United States as a 
superpower. Russia is currently selling weapons to various 
countries. 
  [Reporter] How about the issue of President Kim's visit to 
Russia? 
  [Kim] The Russian Government keeps asking when President Kim 
Yong-sam can visit Russia. However, I have not received any 
kind of a commitment from the government. If President Kim 
visits Russia this year, a year marking the 110th anniversary of 
the establishment of the ROK-Russian diplomatic relations, it 
will be a golden opportunity for both countries to revitalize 
relations. 
  [Reporter] What about the issue of compensating the bereaved 
families of victims of the Korean airliner? 
  [Kim] I have already asked the Russian Government for 
compensation. The Russian Government, however, seems to have the 
notion that more solid information should be provided by the 
United States to clarify the issue. 
  [Reporter] How big is the trade volume between the ROK and 
Russia? 
  [Kim] Last year, bilateral trade amounted to $1.9 billion, 
$0.6 billion in exports and $1.3 billion in imports. However, 
the trade volume is expected to reach up to $10 billion by early 
2000 and Russia will become one of our biggest markets. In 
Russia nowadays, electronic goods manufactured by domestic 
companies such as Samsong, Goldstar, and Daewoo are selling like 
hot cakes. Due to the fact that Russia grants the Generalized 
System of Preference (GSP) to the ROK goods, they are relatively 
cheaper than Japanese goods and, consequently, are competitive.

  [Text] The ROK, China, and North Korea are now discussing 
the details of the ROK's technological and capital investment in 
the project of expanding North Korea's Najin Port and 
constructing a railroad. 
  Liu Baisong, president of the Northeast Asia Railway and 
Port 
Corporation, Ltd. of Jilin, China, came to the ROK on 20 January 
to discuss this matter. He said on 23 January: "The Najin Port 
development project is supposed to be jointly promoted by China 
and North Korea, and North Korea has expressed its position that 
it does not oppose ROK participation in the project in a joint 
venture with China." He also said that he had sounded out ROK 
enterprises like Daewoo and Samsung on their intention to 
participate in the project during his visit to the ROK and that 
they "had expressed their intent to actively participate." 
  China is also asking ROK companies to make joint investments 
in the construction of a 5 km-long borderline railway connecting 
China's Hunchun and North Korea's Hunyung. 
  The project of enlarging the No. 3 and No. 4 Piers of Najin 
Port and equipping them with modern facilities requires a total 
amount of $60 million, and China wants the ROK to invest 
approximately $30 million in the project. 
  North Korea hopes to begin construction in April, and China 
plans to start in June after confirming ROK participation.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 25 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and China 
have agreed to establish a joint industrial committee to promote 
economic cooperation between the two countries, it was reported 
Tuesday. The committee, to be made up of government officials 
and private businessmen, is a follow-up measure discussed at the 
summit between President Kim Yong-sam and Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin in Seattle last November. The committee will be 
formally launched in late March when President Kim pays an 
official visit to China. 
  Under the committee, the two countries will set up a 
subcommittee on automobile, electronic telephone switching 
system and aircraft industries, officials said. 
  In this connection, officials from the Economic Planning 
Board, Foreign, Trade, Industry and Resources and Communications 
Ministries will convene a meeting soon to select South Korean 
members of the committee. The Korean-side chairman of the 
committee is expected to be a vice or assistant minister. 
  With the establishment of the committee, the two countries 
will be able to form a systematic framework for medium- and 
long-term cooperation for the expansion of bilateral trade, one 
senior Foreign Ministry official said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea decided 
Monday to double its foreign investment this year and gain a 
foothold in the American distribution market as a post-North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) trade measure. In the 
first meeting of trade and corporate officials since NAFTA took 
effect last month, the government decided to expand the foreign 
investment fund from 100 billion won last year to 200 billion 
won in 1994. 
  Officials said they hope to register the South Korea-U.S. 
Industrial Cooperation Foundation this month and raise 20 
million U.S. dollars by 1997 to finance joint new technology 
development in nine areas chosen as main exports to the United 
States. This would include semiconductors, machinery, 
construction, aviation, telecommunications equipment, computers, 
medical equipment, environment facilities, power generation 
facilities and automobiles. 
  One of the concerns here on NAFTA has been the strengthened 
regulation on country-of-origin labeling. 
  Officials said they expect makers of home appliances, 
automobiles and fabrics to use locally made parts due to the new 
regulations and decided to urge parts suppliers and 
manufacturing companies to jointly enter the North American 
market. 
  In case of color television sets, manufacturers must use 
locally made braun tube and printed circuit board in order to be 
counted as regional trade. 
  Officials said Korea's three major color television 
exporters 
-- Samsung, Goldstar and Daewoo -- have already advanced into 
Mexico and will establish both assembly and parts manufacturing 
lines there. 
  Korean car manufacturers will be urged to look into southern 
states as a new region of interest to maintain their hold on the 
American market, which has a relatively low 2.5 percent import 
tariff, officials said. 
  In fabric, the government wants yarn makers, fabric dealers 
and clothing companies to enter the market together, officials 
said. 
  To counter falling behind Mexico in price competitiveness 
due 
to NAFTA, the government plans to open group sales outlets by 
industry. 
  It also plans to operate both wholesale and retail outlets 
in 
areas with large resident Korean populations, including New 
York, Chicago and Los Angeles, the officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea faces a 
shower of foreign anti-dumping attacks as the Uruguay Round 
accord, slated to take effect next year, includes shields 
against anti-dumping abuses, the Korea Trade Promotion Corp. 
(KOTRA) said Monday. 
  Canada landed a preliminary dumping margin of 45.6 percent 
on 
Korean steel plate on Jan. 17 and as a result Tongkuk Steel Mill 
Co. has to make deposits equal to the amount for its exports to 
the North American country. 
  On Jan. 6, the Argentine Government said it would slap 
punitive anti-dumping tariffs on Korean-made men's shirts of 
under 4.95 U.S. dollars on its market at the free-on-board rate. 
  Mexico recently announced that it will continue 
investigation 
of Goldstar Co., Daewoo Electronics Co., Sonil Metal Co., and 
Hanil Precision Industries Co., which are suspected of exporting 
at between 5.15 percent and 55.47 percent less than fair prices. 
  Under preliminary dumping findings of between 6.77 percent 
and 29.16 percent on high-density polyethylene and between 11.24 
percent and 17.39 percent on low-density items, the Taipei 
Government went into final screening of Korean exporters. 
  At complaints by local manufacturers, Australia embarked on 
a 
preliminary investigation into Korean and Singaporean PVC 
(polyvinvyl chloride) homopolymer earlier in the month. 
  Hanyang Chemical Corp., Lucky Corp., Goldenbell Co., and 
Samsung Chemical Industries Co. are under charges of dumping 
between 10 percent and 38 percent. The preliminary ruling is 
due sometime in April. 
  India, Korea's major synthetic resin buyer, is said to be 
preparing an anti-dumping attack on the Korean export.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- Korean automakers, to 
cope with moves by the Chinese Government to curb illegal 
imports, are looking for ways to export vehicles to China 
legally. The Chinese administration on auto imports says that 
1,346 Korean automobiles were sold through official channels for 
14.1 million U.S. dollars in January-September last year, 
according to industry sources Monday. 
  In the nine months, the Chinese bought 58,660 Japanese 
vehicles, the highest figure, followed by Russian vehicles at 
39,651, German at 33,774, French at 20,589 and American at 
6,184. Italy placed low with 1,224 vehicles. The Korean share 
of the Chinese import market was 2.3 percent of the Japanese 
share and 21.8 percent of the U.S. share. The real number of 
Korean vehicles sold in China last year is assumed to be nearly 
50,000 (new and used), the sources said. 
  The Chinese Government bans imports of completely assembled 
automobiles in principle but legally purchases nearly 200,000 a 
year with a 180 percent to 220 percent tax by barter or for 
official use. It is estimated that 500,000 to 600,000 foreign 
automobiles are imported by China through legal and illegal 
channels each year. 
  The Chinese Government partly allowed private dealers to 
import vehicles in January, lowered the tax to 80 percent 
minimum and gave a quotas by country. Since it has decided to 
exclude from the quotas nations continuing to export to the 
Chinese market through illegal channels, Korean automakers must 
find new ways to sell in China, a source said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Chang-sop] </F>
  [Text] The government will scrap its restrictions on 
foreign technology inducement and allow local enterprises to 
import whatever foreign technologies at whatever prices from 
March 1. 
  The Ministry of Finance [MOF] said the government will not 
check the "quality of foreign technology and contents of 
contracts between importers and exporters of foreign technology" 
when it reviews reports for introducing foreign technology in 
Korea. 
  The government has sometimes blocked the influx of foreign 
technologies because of expensive royalties on foreign 
technology or their obsolescence. 
  It will also shorten the processing period for accepting 
foreign technology inducement reports to 10 days, compared with 
the current 30 days. 
  The Bank of Korea will no longer be an exclusive window for 
accepting reports from foreign investors in local industries and 
such banks as the Korea Development Bank and Industrial Bank of 
Korea will deal in foreign direct investment reporting services 
from March 1. 
  The MOF said other foreign exchange banks will be authorized 
to accept reports from foreigners on their investment plans here 
from July 1. 
  The diversification of banks accepting foreign direct 
investment reports is designed to help banks compete against 
each other to attract foreign investors. So far, the BOK has 
monopolized the business as the government wanted to "control" 
who invests in domestic industries. 
  Thus from July 1, local banks will be able to accept reports 
from foreign investors when their equity stakes are less than 50 
percent or when they invest less than 3 million dollars in joint 
ventures in which their stakes exceed more than 50 percent. 
  The MOF said it will revise the enforcement decrees on the 
Foreign Capital Inducement Act (FCIA) next week for 
implementation from March 1. 
  The MOF said the revision of the FCIA enforcement decrees is 
to simplify foreign investment procedures, enhance transparency, 
ease rules and provide administrative services for foreign 
investors in Korea. 
  Under the new FCIA enforcement decrees, it will take only 
five days for foreign investors to get government approval for 
investing in Korean industries, compared with the current 30 
days. Even when the MOF needs consultations with other 
government ministries for reviewing the applications, it will 
not take more than 15 days for international investors to get 
approval from Korea. 
  For projects that do not need government approval, 
foreigners 
can immediately initiate business in Korea as soon as they make 
a notification to Korea. Currently, it takes 20-30 days for 
foreign investors to make a report on their investment plans to 
the government. 
  The government will reduce its intervention in business 
diversification activities of foreign enterprises and joint 
venture firms following their investment in local industries, it 
said. 
  For example, foreign enterprises and joint venture firms 
will 
diversify into other projects, and easily sell and buy stocks to 
invest in or divest themselves from their Korean operations 
after they invested in local industries, the MOF said. 
  Foreigners which hold less than 10 percent equities stakes 
in 
local companies will not be subject to various restrictions.

  [Text] It was learned on 23 January that the Defense 
Ministry will export about 10 F5AB fighter planes of the ROK Air 
Force to Thailand at the cost of from $1 to $1.5 million each. 
F5AB is an outmoded fighter plane model that was introduced 
from the United States late in the sixties. This is the first 
time the ROK has exported planes. The United States originally 
opposed the ROK's plan to export planes of this model, but has 
recently consented to it.

  [Reporter] What merits do you think you have that won you 
the 
appointment as defense minister? 
  [Yi] I do not know exactly. What I can tell you is that even 
after I was discharged from active duty, I continued to study 
national defense issues with the will and passion for reform, 
regarding it as my professional field. After I was placed on the 
reserve list, I realized that the military was not the whole 
world. While working as consul general in Honolulu and as 
director of the Office of Veterans Administration, I learned 
many things about world affairs. I think this was part of the 
merits for my appointment. 
  [Reporter] By how many years was President Kim Yong-sam your 
senior at Kyongnam High School, and when did you meet President 
Kim Yong-sam? 
  [Yi] President Kim was a graduate of the third class and I 
was a graduate of the 11th. So, I am eight years behind him. I 
first met him when I was chief of operation of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff in 1992. When President Kim, then chairman of the 
Democratic Liberal Party, was inspecting frontline areas, I 
accompanied him because the deputy chief of the Joint Staff was 
on leave. Since President Kim rode the bus together with 
National Defense Committee assemblymen, I thought it was a good 
opportunity to explain the defense budget. So I did it with a 
portable speaker. 
  [Reporter] People say that after President Kim was elected, 
you acted as his "staff" person for military affairs. 
  [Yi] No. I was not in the appropriate position to do so. I 
was in the middle of the Pacific Ocean as consul general in 
Hawaii while he was in Sangdodong, Seoul. 
  [Reporter] What do you think about the position of defense 
minister? 
  [Yi] Just as a proverb says that the one who looks down the 
chessboard has a wider view of the game than the actual players, 
I came to face many practical restrictions and to realize 
difficulties of working-level officials. 
  [Reporter] Now that the investigation of the incident of 
shells imports fraud came to a temporary settlement and your 
report to Chongwadae [presidential office] has been completed, 
we think that you will now undertake your work at a full scale. 
  [Yi] The mission of defense minister is, above all, to 
protect the nation and people from a "miserable" war. A total of 
1 million troops from both sides are still in confrontation with 
each other with a 155-mile Armistice Line in between them. The 
fire power has now increased by 100 times from that of the 
Korean War. If a war breaks out, everything that all the people 
have achieved with all their energy during the past 40 years 
will collapse. Therefore, our Army should assume a stance to 
prevent war by all means. As you know, the people in the North 
are unpredictable. 
  [Reporter] Some people say that since democratization was 
initiated, North Korea is not regarded as "the main enemy" in 
the troop training and information program in the military. Is 
this true? 
  [Yi] This has indeed delicate aspects. To say that North 
Korea is the main enemy may be somewhat excessive. However, the 
military should direct its main efforts on "preventing North 
Korea's provocation." 
  [Reporter] There are two different views: that North Korea 
is 
incapable of starting a war because of its economic difficulties 
and that it can start a war at any moment. This causes confusion 
among the people. What is your view? 
  [Yi] I think such controversy might have been prompted by 
the eccentric political system in the North. North Korea's 
gross national product is only one-tenth of ours. Therefore, 
North Korea's military power should also be regarded as such. 
However, the practical situation is quite the opposite. For 
example, although I cannot reveal all, I can tell you that the 
number of sorties made by North Korean air force planes and the 
number and scale of military mobilizations and maneuvers during 
the past three years far exceed ours. This situation has not 
changed even today. We should think that this is possible only 
under North Korea's eccentric system. 
  [Reporter] Do you think there is the possibility of a North 
Korean military provocation? 
  [Yi] Yes. There certainly is. I wish I could show you 
related materials including aerial photographs to prove this. 
  [Reporter] Have there been any indications of a military 
provocation from North Korea recently? 
  [Yi] There has always been such a possibility in the past. 
However, since Kim Chong-il was nominated as supreme commander 
of the military last March, there has been even a greater 
possibility. Last October, the "order of tonsure" was handed out 
to the entire Army, and all soldiers had their hair cut. Tonsure 
means a certain "determination." 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion of the North Korean nuclear 
issue and the Team Spirit exercise? 
  [Yi] North Korea must completely return to the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty and accept overall inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. We will be ready to suspend 
the Team Spirit exercise, although it has nothing to do with the 
North Korean nuclear issue, so that the North-South dialogue can 
make progress. However, I would like to clearly say that if 
North Korea does not comply with them, we would have nothing to 
concede. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Will there be any large-scale personnel reshuffle 
within the military? 
  [Yi] No. There will be no such reshuffle. Only when 
stability is attained within their organization, can the 
soldiers be devoted to defense. Otherwise, they will turn their 
eyes, leveled at the North, to Seoul. 
  [Reporter] We understand that you are member of Hanahoe 
[private circle of military academy graduates]. When did you 
become a member? 
  [Yi] That is an old story. Let us not talk about this. 
  I always did my best in any given situation during the past 
33 years of military service. I will do so in the future, too. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] There is a rumor that you, Minister Yi, advised 
all high-ranking officers in the military who are Hanahoe 
members to voluntarily resign from active duty. 
  [Yi] The will for decision within the military should not be 
hovered. If one thinks it is difficult to contribute to the 
military any more, one should courageously resign from it. 
  [Reporter] Some people stress that young and capable 
officers, who became Hanahoe members without having volunteered 
to join the organization, should not be placed in a position of 
disadvantage. 
  [Yi] That is very sensitive issue. I intend to work out 
appropriate measures. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- Veteran opposition 
leader Kim Tae-chung hangs up the nameboard of his research 
institute Thursday and sets sail as captain of a ship that he is 
determined will provide the brainpower for Korean unification, 
democratization and Asia-Pacific peace. After leaving politics 
in 1992, Kim devoted himself to forming a 
"strictly-non-political" foundation while waving aside a cloud 
of rumors on his return to the political picture. 
  The KDJ (for Kim's initials) Peace Foundation has been in 
the 
public eye since Kim first spoke of it last year, not only 
because of the influence he has in the political world but also 
because of the list of political, religious, and scholastic 
bigtimers at home and abroad who willingly took part in the 
foundation. 
  Foreign advisers are former presidents Mikhail Gorbachev of 
the Soviet Union and Corazon Aquino of the Philippines, and 
former German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Advisers 
from home are Cardinal Stephen Kim Su-hwan of the Roman Catholic 
Church, the Ven. So We-hyon, head of the Chokye Order of the 
Buddhism, the Rev. Kang Won-yong, president of the Institute of 
Christian Academy, and Yi Tae-yong, president of the Family Law 
Counseling Institute. 
  The 21-man committee of consultants that will be deeply 
engaged in foundation activities, include poet Ko Un, Seoul 
National University President Kim Chong-un, Korea University 
President Kim Hui-chip, former Korea Broadcasting System General 
Director So Yong-hun, Yi Se-chung, president of the Korea 
Association of Lawyers, and former Vice Prime Minister Cho Sun. 
  Among the 10 foreign consultants are Moscow University 
President Viktor Sadovnichi; Selig Harrison, senior research 
fellow of the Carnegie Foundation of International Peace; Former 
U.S. Ambassador to Seoul James Lilley; Harvard University 
President Edward Baker; Former East German Prime Minister Lothar 
de Maiziere; Mushakoji Kinhide, chairman of the Japanese Council 
on International Affairs; and Smiya Mikiyo, an honorary 
professor at Tokyo University. 
  Directors of the board under Kim's chairmanship are his 
wife, 
Yi Hui-ho; Yi Mun-yong, dean of the graduate school of Kyongki 
University; Choe Yong-kun, a former member of the National 
Assembly; and Cho Sung-hung, a lawyer. Dr. Cho Yung-hwan, 
director of the Institute of Far Eastern Affairs, serves as 
secretary-general of the foundation. Eight young permanent 
researchers, who include six holders of political science 
doctorates and one of administration science, were selected 
after public screening and 18 professors were named 
non-permanent researchers. 
  The foundation was founded on capital of 3 billion won by 
selling real estate of Kim's wife and will financially depend on 
public patronage for future management. As it first official 
event, the foundation hosts an international seminar on 
Wednesday on topics of changes of the world order and 
democratization in Asia, prospects for inter-Korean relations, 
and assessment and challenge of the future. 
  John Dunn, a professor at Cambridge University; Na Chong-il, 
a professor of Kyonghee University; and former East German 
Premier Lothar de Maiziere will speak. 
  On Thursday, at the founding ceremony, Cardinal Kim and 
Aquino will make the opening speeches, and congratulatory 
messages from former Presidents Jimmy Carter of the United 
States and Gorbachev will be read. The foundation, located in a 
commercial building near Kim's house in Tongkyo-tong, has 
already agreed on partnership with the Gorbachev Foundation. 
Gorbachev has promised to preside over a seminar in Seoul and 
many Asian human rights and democracy leaders are lined up to 
visit Korea, a foundation spokesman said. 
  Kim is to tour Denmark, Norway and Sweden from Sunday to 
seek 
cooperation with peace institutes there.

<F P=106> [By reporter Choe Won-sok] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that the League of South Korean 
Socialist Workers [Sanomaeng], which calls itself an independent 
[chasaengjok] socialist group and advocates radical 
revolutionism, which has caused the detention of many members, 
will dissolve of its own volition soon. 
  According to a high-ranking intelligence official on 24 
January, "Sanomaeng has announced it will begin legal activities 
through advertisements in daily newspapers and interviews with 
magazines. It has been learned that there is a move among those 
who advocate the legitimate line to found a legitimate 
progressive party." 
  However, the official said, "Considering the fact that at 
the 
end of last year over 20 people were arrested for attempting to 
rebuild Sanomaeng in Cholla provinces, some remaining forces may 
insist on keeping the original Sanomaeng." 
  Since its foundation in November 1989, Sanomaeng, which 
claimed to be "independent Leninist," has evoked controversy in 
and outside activist groups by founding a clandestine party and 
advocating the line for reforming the political system through 
revolution. Its activities were actually suspended after the 
arrest of its executive members including Pak No-hae and Paek 
Tae-ung.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 25 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party [DLP] and the main opposition Democratic Party 
[DP] agreed Tuesday to hold the next parliamentary elections on 
April 14, 1996, and the next presidential election on Dec. 18, 
1997. The agreement was reached at a meeting of six 
representatives from the two parties on legislation of an 
omnibus election law. 
  Under the agreement, the presidential election will be held 
on the first Thursday from 70 days before the expiration of the 
term for the incumbent president. 
  The general elections and elections for local autonomous 
legislature and for chiefs of local governing bodies will be 
held on the first Thursday from 50 days before the expiration of 
the incumbents. 
  According to current laws, elections for local autonomous 
legislature and chiefs of local autonomous administrations 
should be carried out between Feb. 27, 1995 and May 21, 1995. 
But if political parties agree to hold all four elections on 
the same day, the date for local elections would be specifically 
mentioned in an additional clause of the election law. 
  With regard to election campaign periods, the two parties 
could not work out agreement. 
  The DLP wanted 21 days for presidential campaign and 15 days 
for other elections, while the DP called for 25 days for 
president and 17 days for parliamentary and local elections. 
Because of the disagreement, the dates for by-elections and 
reelections were not fixed. 
  The two parties will begin to discuss laws on political 
funds 
Wednesday and Thursday.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul Prosecution on 
Monday afternoon placed under arrest Chang Yong-cha on charges 
of fraud and violating the bad check control law. The 
prosecution charge said Chang last October illegally withdrew 
from the Apkujong branch of the Seoul Trust Bank 3 billion won 
belonging to Ms. Ha Chong-im without the depositor's permission. 
Chang is also suspected of cheating 7.75 billion won out of the 
Sampo Mutual Trust Fund with the false promise of giving the 
fund a large deposit. The charge also said that when she was 
heading Yupyong Corp. as its chairwoman last October, the corp. 
issued a 500-million-won note but failed to honor it. 
  A law stipulates that a person found guilty of fraud 
involving more than 5 billion won is to be given a term of five 
years to life. Besides, she had five years and two more months 
to serve when she was paroled in 1992 from prison. She was 
serving a 15-year term over a 1982 financial scandal. 
  Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry on Monday afternoon 
retracted 
the parole granted to Chang in 1992, obliging her to serve out 
the remaining term. 
  A ministry official said that by law a parole may be 
cancelled if the parolee fails to behave properly or engages in 
abnormal conducts. "We have cancelled her parole upon she was 
arrested," the official said.

  [Text] Seoul, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- The Science and 
Technology Ministry will invite nearly 100 distinguished Korean 
or foreign scientists from abroad to visit Korea this year to 
teach Koreans advanced science and develop standards, a ministry 
spokesman said Monday. Korea has difficulties because advanced 
countries are reluctant to transfer sophisticated technologies 
for fear of the so-called boomerang effect. The ministry will 
invite scientists with doctorates and more than five years of 
research experience, but will waive its standards for scientists 
with remarkable achievements on a global scale. 
  The scientists will be given air fares, moving costs in 
addition to their salaries, which are higher than they are 
receiving in their countries of residence. The ministry hopes 
to develop the level of science and research under momentum of 
internationalization, the spokesman said.

<F P=106> ["Opening Address" by Rangoon Mayor U Ko Lay, chairman of </F>
the mass rally and member of the USDA secretariat, at the mass 
rally held in Rangoon on 15 January] 
  [Text] Esteemed people: I would like to extend my best 
wishes for physical and mental wellbeing of the mass of people 
wholeheartedly attending the mass rally sponsored by the Union 
Solidarity and Development Association [USDA]. 
  We have strong desire for realization of the noble and 
genuine objectives of the recently-founded USDA. Active 
participation of the entire mass of people is now essential for 
realization of the following five objectives of the USDA; 
  1. Non-disintegration of the Union, 
  2. Non-disintegration of national unity, 
  3. Perpetuation of sovereignty, 
  4. Promotion and vitalization of national pride, and 
  5. Emergence of a prosperous, peaceful, and modern Union. 
  These five objectives, in fact, reflect the basic welfare 
for 
the union nationals. It is therefore essential for the entire 
mass of people to wholeheartedly support the USDA and to 
earnestly take part for realization of the five objectives. 
  All patriotic Myanmar [Burmese] people desire perpetuity of 
the union, consolidation of unity among union nationals, and 
perpetuation of sovereignty. As we all encountered and overcame 
suffering and misery owing to the loss of sovereignty, we all 
must safeguard our sovereignty sacrificing our lives not to fall 
into servitude again. The fourth objective of the USDA -- 
promotion and vitalization of national pride -- is specially 
essential for gradual fading away of the spirit of patriotism is 
inclined to incapacitate safeguarding of sovereignty. The 
entire mass of people must therefore cultivate the spirit of 
patriotism to a new height. 
  Myanmar nationals cannot help speaking in praise of the USDA 
which is endowed with the objectives for emergence of an 
affluent modern nation. As all know, today, the State Law and 
Order Restoration Council [SLORC] is laying down foundations for 
emergence of an affluent modern nation. We all are to 
congratulate the SLORC for its farsighted efforts for all-round 
national development spending tens of millions of money in the 
education and health sectors, construction of roads, bridges, 
railroads, airports, parks, gardens, and various buildings. 
That is why, I would like to urge you to decide to 
wholeheartedly uphold the five objectives of the USDA. 
  I would like to emphatically urge the entire mass of people 
to cooperate and provide support for consolidation and extensive 
formation of the USDA to be able to stand tall and firm as 
national front that will organize national movement with noble 
and genuine objectives. 
  Esteemed people: The National Convention, which is 
comparable to the architect for emergence of a new democratic 
state in Myanmar history, has been held since 9 January 1993. 
On 16 September 1993, the national convention plenary session 
laid down 104 basic principles for formulating state fundamental 
principles to be incorporated into the state constitution. 
  Every observer will find vividly that all these 104 basic 
principles are mirror of the welfare of the Union of Myanmar 
[Burma] and union nationals in all angles at present and in 
future. Evidently, 39 of the 104 basic principles are found to 
be laid down as fundamental principles. They are: 
  1. Non-disintegration of the union, 
  2. Non-disintegration of national solidarity, 
  3. Perpetuation of sovereignty, 
  4. Flourishing of a genuine multiparty democracy system, 
  5. Further burgeoning of the noblest and worthiest of 
worldly values namely justice, liberty, and equality in the 
state, 
  6. For the tatmadaw [defense services] to be able to 
participate in the national political leadership role of the 
state, 
  7. The state is constituted by Pyidaungsu [Union] system, 
  8. The state practices genuine multiparty democracy 
system, 
  9. The state economic system shall be market economic 
system, 
  10. The head of state is the president of the state, 
  11. Sovereign power of the state is derived from the 
citizens and is in force in the whole country,

  In addition to these 39 basic principles, the remaining 65 
are also of importance in respective chapters. We must, 
therefore, treasure the 104 basic principles for formulating 
principles as firm foundation for our much desired new 
democratic state. 
  All of us are responsible for protecting these 104 basic 
principles against any obstruction and deviation. 
  It is encouraging that these 104 basic principles were laid 
down as much as possible to reflect the six objectives of the 
National Convention: 
  1. Non-disintegration of the union, 
  2. Non-disintegration of national solidarity, 
  3. Perpetuation of sovereignty, 
  4. For a genuine multiparty democracy system to flourish, 
  5. For further burgeoning of the noblest and worthiest of 
worldly values namely justice, liberty, and equality, and, 
  6. For the tatmadaw to be able to participate in the 
national political leadership role of the future state. 
  All desire to safeguard the basic principles for formulating 
principles without losing sight of them and wish the national 
convention success after procuring detailed suggestions when it 
resumes. 
  Esteemed people: Now is the time for all nationals to make 
utmost efforts for national development and emergence of an 
affluent modern nation accepting it as a national task. 
  As the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC] is 
based on consolidated, united tatmadaw, it is practically and 
effectively striving for the welfare of the state and the people 
in conformity with its fine traditions. In the present era of 
changing the economic, social, and political spheres, it is 
essential for the entire mass of people to actively take part in 
their respective roles zealously and intensively. Peasants have 
to strive for boosting production of quality crops and workers 
on their part have to prevent loss and wastage and be free from 
graft while making concerted efforts for boosting production of 
their factories and mills. All are urged to maintain roads and 
bridges, dams and reservoirs, schools, hospitals, parks and 
gardens, and buildings built by the state in various parts of 
the country. 
  So also, I would like to urge the entire mass of people to 
participate actively in the state's short-term and long-term 
projects for building a modern, developed country. 
  As the saying "Make hay while the sun shines" goes, it is 
opportune for armed groups to abandon their incurred stand and 
return to the legal fold, and to join hands with the state in 
all round development tasks. 
  The top national objective of the SLORC is "Our three main 
national causes". It is essential for non-disintegration of the 
union, non-disintegration of national solidarity, and 
perpetuation of sovereignty. Like the Myanmar [Burmese] saying 
"If the cattle are scattered the tiger seizes them", disunity 
among union nationals is the opportune state for neocolonialists 
and the state and the people may suffer low. 
  All nationals have to uphold and cherish the fine traditions 
of the forefathers who defended the state against the dangers 
through unity among national races and lived through weal or 
woe. Now it is time to promote and vitalize these fine 
traditions of our forefathers. 
  From this mass meeting, all armed groups are urged to accept 
the invitation of the SLORC and return to the legal fold. 
  Esteemed people: The Union of Myanmar [Burma] is an 
independent and sovereign state. As all know, Myanmar had to 
strive hard in national freedom battles for over a hundred years 
to become an independent state. In conformity with an 
independent, sovereign state, Myanmar always upholds the 
principles of peaceful coexistence among nations. 
  Governments of the Union of Myanmar have always taken a 
constructive stand in international affairs and supported 
efforts for world peace, prevention of outbreak of wars, and 
general and total disarmament. It is undeniable that Myanmar 
has never intended and attempted to work against the interests 
of any other country. Myanmar expects reciprocal, sincere 
relations from every nation. 
  Under prevailing political condition, the neocolonialists 
have been making false allegations against Myanmar with the aim 
of enabling their axe handles [henchmen] to gain power. The 
traitor axe handles, who have dealings with neocolonialist 
groups on economic grounds, have cooked up stories to tarnish 
the dignity of Myanmar. These are the acts to ignore and insult 
the sovereignty of our state. 
  It is human nature that a person or an organization or a 
nation is liable to do good or bad. Under unavoidable 
circumstances, strength is applied in some matters. Bitter 
quinine has to be used to banish malaria though one knows it is 
too bitter. Similarly, there are restrictions on the rights of 
freedom to ensure prevalence of peace and tranquillity and for 
non-disintegration of national unity. As the SLORC strives for 
prevalence of peace and tranquillity and law and order, crime 
has diminished considerably. 
  Every educated person understands that for flourishing of 
genuine democracy, the state is laying down firm foundation for 
the community. 
  Esteemed people: In conclusion, I would like to emphatically 
urge all patriotic nationals at this mass rally sponsored by the 
Yangon [Rangoon] Division Union Solidarity and Development 
Association [USDA]; 
  -- to support the 104 basic principles laid down by the 
National Convention, 
  -- to uphold the five objectives of the USDA, 
  -- for the armed groups to return to the legal fold and 
actively take part in all round national development tasks, 
  -- to prevent subversions at home and abroad that would 
disrupt perpetuation of sovereignty, 
  -- to strive hard for emergence of affluent nation as a 
national task, and, 
  -- to make concerted efforts for consolidation of Union 
Solidarity and Development Associations.

  [Editorial Report] Since 15 January, Rangoon radio and 
television have carried a series of live and recorded reports on 
"mass rallies" held throughout Burma by the Union Solidarity and 
Development Association [USDA]. According to the radio, USDA 
members, departmental officials and public service personnel, 
workers, peasants, fire service reserves, members of the 
Literature and Periodicals and Theater Associations, athletes, 
local people, students, and members of local Red Cross brigades 
have been among those participating in the rallies. 
  Rangoon Radio Burma in Burmese at 1330 GMT on 15 January 
carries a 37-minute report on a rally held by the Union 
Solidarity and Development Association of Rangoon Division on 15 
January at Aung San Stadium. The rally was carried live on 
Burmese television and radio. 
  According to the radio, the rally was attended by 110,000 
people, including USDA members from four districts of Rangoon 
Division and members of the public. Those present "unanimously" 
endorsed the six motions that were put forward at the meeting: 
"Fully support the 104 basic principles laid down by the 
National Convention; Solemnly support the five objectives of the 
USDA; Urge the armed organizations in the jungle to give up the 
policy of armed struggle and cooperate in working for the 
development and prosperity of the Union; For the indigenous 
people to safeguard national sovereignty from internal and 
external threats; For all indigenous people to undertake as a 
national duty to develop the Union into a peaceful, modern, and 
prosperous state; and To assist in strengthening the USDA." 
  U Ko Lay, secretary of the USDA and mayor of Rangoon, 
delivered an opening address at the rally, explaining the 
significance of the USDA's five objectives: nondisintegration of 
the Union; nondisintegration of national unity; perpetuation of 
sovereign powers; promotion of patriotism with the objective of 
enhancing national pride; and national development and the 
emergence of a peaceful, modern, and prosperous nation. He also 
explained the need for the people to implement these objectives. 
U Ko Lay noted the people's support and praise for the State 
Law and Order Restoration Council's [SLORC] national development 
endeavors and the work being done by the National Convention. 
He enumerated the 39 basic principles laid down by the National 
Convention, saying the people have a duty to defend these 
principles. 
  U Ko Lay said the SLORC -- which is based on the united 
Defense Services -- is working effectively for social, economic, 
and political development and the emergence of a modern state. 
He also urged the organizations in the jungle to return to the 
"legal fold." Continuing, he explained Burma's foreign policy 
and actions as well as the subversive activities of the 
"neocolonialists and their local henchmen," urging the public to 
safeguard the country's sovereignty. 
  In conclusion, he called on the public to support the 104 
basic principles laid down by the National Convention and 
support the USDA's five objectives. He called on the 
jungle-based organizations to give up the armed struggle, 
cooperate in working for the development of the union, and 
safeguard the country from external and internal threats. He 
called on all indigenous people to undertake the development of 
the union and the emergence of a peaceful and modern state as a 
national duty, and to strengthen the organization of USDA.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "To protect and serve the nation"] </F>
  [Text] The Union Solidarity and Development Association 
[USDA] was formed and registered as a social organization with 
the ministry of home affairs on 15 September 1993. 
  It emerged to serve the needs of the times. If we are to 
prepare both the young and the old alike for their future tasks 
once the democratic system starts functioning full swing, we 
will have to prepare them for it. With that in mind, the 
leadership launched this social organization with the noble aims 
of working for the non- disintegration of the union, 
non-disintegration of national unity, perpetuation of 
sovereignty, promotion and vitalization of national pride, and 
emergence of a prosperous, peaceful, and modern union. 
  These lofty aims are worthy of being upheld and transformed 
into reality for they concern our wellbeing and our future. The 
youth in any nation are gregarious, sociable, and outgoing. To 
nurture them, to harness their positive traits, they must be 
given the benefit of some form of guidance. From young, they 
get parental guidance and also at school. However, they must be 
able to join organizations with extra-curricular activities, 
taught trades useful to themselves and to others. 
  In the aftermath of the chaos and anarchy of the late '80s, 
the social organizations could not absorb the bulk of youths 
enthusiastic to join. Hence the need for one that would cater 
to their desires. That the authorities had devised a way for 
them to identify themselves with a distinctive organization came 
as a boon and at an opportune moment. 
  The State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], which 
has been making preparations for retransfer of power to the 
rightful people, took the necessary measure to see to the 
emergence of the kind of organization they very much need. 
Members who are 10 and above, regardless of sex, class, creed 
or faith, will be able to get together for a common cause -- 
that of protecting and serving the motherland. 
  Both minors designated as junior members and adults 
designated as senior members, will be involved in 
nation-building tasks. All members are to swear their 
allegiance to the nation under the Four Oaths, observe an 
11-point Code of Conduct, and live up to 14 Duties and 
Responsibilities, which means they will be able to prove 
themselves worthy of identity with the union. 
  The mammoth rally that was held at Aung San Stadium 
yesterday 
was one of a kind, for it brought together a merry mix of 
students, teachers, and people from other walks of life. 
  More rallies are coming up. They will endorse the USDA and 
help strengthen the nation's chances of seeing peace and 
progress.

  [Text] Hundreds of thousands of people are reportedly 
being forced to attend mass rallies throughout Burma organized 
by the country's military junta. Critics say the rallies, which 
have been held in the name of the junta's new political front, 
the Union Solidarity and Development Association [USDA], are 
being manipulated by the regime to legitimize its control on 
politics. The report coincides with news that the second 
biggest rebel army is due in the capital, Rangoon, next month to 
sign a cease-fire agreement with the military government. 
  Evan Williams says the deal was to end 30 years of 
insurgency 
by Kachin fighters in Burma's far north. 
  [Begin Williams recording] Kachin mediators in the state 
capital say the delegation is due in Rangoon to ratify a 
cease-fire reached late last year. It is an important 
psychological victory for the junta on the brink of similar 
talks with all other major ethnic insurgent groups and it will 
be held up to a critical world as progress toward peace in 
Burma. Ethnic groups have been promised a role in drafting the 
new constitution and some economic and legislative autonomy, but 
both sides remain armed and critics warn the constitution is 
already being dominated by the junta's aim to retain power.

  [Text] A ceremony to mark the upgrading of a border gate 
in Laos' Houai Sai District, Bokeo Province, and Thailand's 
Chiang Khong District, Chiang Rai Province, to an international 
border gate was held on 21 January. The Houai Sai-Chiang Khong 
border gate was upgraded to the level of international in 
accordance with an agreement reached between governments of Laos 
and Thailand. The upgrade is aimed at creating favorable 
conditions for the raising of trade relations and exchanges from 
local to international levels. This border gate will also 
create favorable conditions for foreign guests as well as 
domestic travelers to travel to third countries. 
  There are now two international-level border gates at the 
Lao-Thai border, namely the Tha Deua-Nong Khai and the Houai 
Sai-Chiang Khong border gates. 
  A further report said that on 21 January, Charat Phuachuai, 
deputy minister of communications of Thailand, donated 31.5 
million kips in aid to the Bokeo provincial administration. 
Accepting the aid on behalf of the provincial administration 
was Khamsai Phomisai, deputy governor the province. Out of the 
total, 30 million kips will be used to expand and asphalt a road 
linking the municipal area and the provincial airport. 
Meanwhile, the remaining 1.5 million kips will be used for the 
rehabilitation of various temples in the municipal area. The 
Thai deputy communications minister presented the aid to the 
Bokeo provincial administration while leading a ceremonial 
offering of yellow robes and alms to Buddhist monks at the Keo 
Phonsavan temple in the municipal area of the province.

  [Text] All Thai drug suppression units must prepare for 
hard work as opium production in the Golden Triangle under 
control of drug warlord Khun Sa reportedly hit a record of at 
least 3,500 tons at the end of last year, Pol Lt-Gen Kowit 
Phakdiphum, the former commissioner of the Narcotics Suppression 
Bureau warned yesterday. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Kowit, who has recently been promoted to 
assistant 
police chief, said that Khun Sa would try to refine the raw 
opium into heroin and traffic the illicit drug to markets abroad 
as soon as possible as he needed a large amount of money to buy 
weapons and food supplies to fight Burmese troops. 
  "Thailand would have to take the heavy burden of cracking 
down on drug traffickers to save the world from narcotics." 
  Pol Lt-Gen Kowit said Thai officials must increase 
cooperation with representatives of 14 countries in Asia, Europe 
and North America now working at their embassies on drug 
prevention and suppression campaigns. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Kowit yesterday bade farewell to his subordinates 
at the Narcotics Suppression Bureau as he was about to leave for 
the North this week to oversee the operations of Police Region 5 
which covers Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Mae Hong Son, Lamphun, 
Lamphang, Payao, Nan and Phrae. His successor, Pol Lt-Gen 
Somchai Milindarangkun, would go on with a plan to jointly set 
up a hotline centre on narcotics suppression with China. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Kowit said he would join the delegation of Deputy 
Prime Minister Amnuay Wirawan to Rangoon on February 9 for the 
second meeting of Thailand, Laos and Burma on drug suppression. 
The first meeting was held in Bangkok in 1992.

  [Text] Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak said Thailand does 
not support drug trafficking and will cooperate with the 
international police in suppressing the trade in illegal 
narcotics. 
  The minister said if Khun Sa could stop producing heroin as 
he announced, the country's image would be indirectly improved, 
for Thailand has often been accused of being a drug trafficking 
route for the heroin produced by the drug warlord. 
  Thailand was in fact the first country in Southeast Asia to 
persuade hilltribes people to stop producing heroin, thanks to 
the initiative of His Majesty the King, noted Gen Wichit. 
  Meanwhile, Narcotics Suppression Bureau [NSB] Commissioner 
Somchai Milintharangkun announced an increase in the police 
personnel, technology, and rewards to combat drug dealers. 
  Pol Lt-Gen [Police Lieutenant General] Somchai also promised 
to take severe action against careless police who allow drug 
dealers to escape from captivity. Bad police must be ousted. 
NSB police might also be transferred because some are easily 
corrupted by drug dealers when offered money and property. He 
also had a plan to move drug suppression offices to a more 
well-protected area to prevent information on confidential cases 
from being leaked.

  [Summary From Poor Reception] I assure you that the Royal 
Government will try to solve problems while taking the interests 
of our compatriot traders into account. Whatever I do is in the 
name of the Royal Government. There have been cases when it was 
said that problems could not be solved; yet the Royal Government 
solved them without any demonstrations occurring. But there is 
no need to praise Ranariddh or say that he is a hero. 
  There are still many problems to be solved, such as the 
schools lacking textbooks and teachers, poverty in rural areas, 
insecurity, and so forth. We should not focus exclusively on 
the problems with the Olympic Market. The problem will be 
solved without putting Cambodia's interests at risk. This 
should be done properly. I am very concerned about unauthorized 
checkpoints. This is a problem we must solve. I urge all of 
you to be considerate and sympathetic to the Royal Government. 
Show the international community that Cambodia has no problems; 
that we have social and political stability.

Norodom Ranariddh received at his residence the Austrian 
delegation led by His Excellency [H.E.] Wolfgang Schallenberg, 
Austrian deputy foreign minister. 
  The first prime minister talked about the efforts of the 
Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] to search for peace, national 
reconciliation, and particularly in national rehabilitation and 
reconstruction, under the correct leadership of his majesty the 
king. Prince Krompreah further said that the RGC has four goals 
for the investment sector, namely political stability, higher 
wages, identifying land for leasing, and lower taxes. 
  Concerning the Khmer Rouge issue, Prince Krompreah said that 
this cannot be considered a big issue. Furthermore, the RGC 
will make Sihanoukville a duty-free zone for investment. He 
further said that as for agriculture, the royal government has 
paid great attention to vigorously promoting the standard of 
living by paying attention to clearing networks of canals, 
planting trees and other crops, and ending the clearing of 
forests. 
  Schallenberg expressed profound thanks for Cambodian efforts 
to rehabilitate and rebuild the country. He further said that 
along with providing assistance to rebuild the hydropower 
station at Kirirom, the Austrian Government will continue to 
contribute to assisting the Cambodian Government and people 
within the lofty Austrian-Cambodian ties of friendship.

<F P=106> [Report by Brian Hansford: "Rangsi and Thai Firm Sparring as </F>
Anger Spreads"] 
  [Text] Phnom Penh -- Two weeks ago, Cambodia's Finance 
Minister Sam Rangsi told visiting Thai business people his 
country needed good money to replace bad. 
  Passing this message on to the Thai Boon Rong (TBR) company 
was what ordinary Cambodians did last Thursday in their third 
protest against prices at the TBR-built market in central Phnom 
Penh. 
  "The good investors will drive out the bad," read placards 
last week, using a near identical line from Rangsi's speech made 
during Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's Cambodia visit. 
  Support for the dispute has widened since the last 
demonstration on December 20. Some of last week's protesters 
said they were students from several Phnom Penh colleges. 
  Apart from supporting the traders' claims that rents at the 
soon to-be-completed TBR market are too high, demonstrators said 
they were showing their support for Rangsi in his heated war of 
words with TBR chairman Theng Bun Ma. 
  "We come here because we want to find justice for Sam 
Rangsi," student leader Pich Moniroat told journalists in front 
of 1,000 people gathered opposite Phnom Penh's National Assembly 
building. 
  At a January 11 press conference, Rangsi said King Sihanouk 
had sent a message fully supporting the market traders, wrote 
the latest edition of Cambodia's fortnightly English-language 
PHNOM PENH POST newspaper. 
  A few days later, the TBR chairman published a letter in 
another local newspaper describing Rangsi as "the minister of 
destroying national economy and finance" accusing him of using 
"inciting" language, and inviting him to "inspect our company". 
  Rangsi's written response spoke of "the economic colonialist 
yoke of the Thai Boon Rong company which has the backing of the 
mafia operating in nearby countries". In his letter, Rangsi 
promised to send "officials to inspect your company in the 
future". 
  A student from Phnom Penh's economics institute said he had 
come to support Rangsi against TBR. "The youth support king, 
National Assembly, and Sam Rangsi" read a nearby placard. 
  "I come here with the youth and business people to ask the 
Government to kick the Thai Boon Rong company out of Cambodia," 
said Pich Moniroat, who told journalists he was head of the 
Patriotic Youth Association from Phnom Penh University. 
  "Why didn't Thai Boon Rong settle with excellency Sam Rangsi 
in a quiet way (instead) of putting in the newspaper?" asked 
Pich rhetorically. 
  Unofficial Cambodian sources say the REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA 
newspaper which ran Theng Bun Ma's criticism of Rangsi is at 
least partly owned by the TBR group. In his written reply to 
the company chairman, Rangsi refers to the "clarification which 
you had your newspaper publish". 
  The demonstration seems to have caught the imagination of an 
increasing number of Cambodians. Details remain sketchy about 
TBR itself. 
  Chairman Theng Bun Ma is a Sino-Cambodian from Kompong Cham 
province, a TBR representative told Inside Indochina. 
  "According to what I receive, he is originally a Cambodian 
who fled durihg the war to become a Thai citizen," Cambodia's 
Information Ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse said in a 
telephone interview last week. "The company is a Thai company." 
  In the TBR chairman's newspaper message to Rangsi, the 
letter 
accused the finance minister of daring to "denounce the previous 
government". 
  Senior officials in the now-defunct State of Cambodia (SOC) 
regime are widely blamed by Cambodians for corrupt selling of 
state assets which led to Phnom Penh's December 1991 
anti-corruption riots. 
  The TBR chairman appears to be trying to exaggerate 
differences between the former SOC rulers and the FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] party to which Rangsi belongs and 
which won the elections in May, observers say. 
  After the second market demonstration in December, First 
Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh's Cabinet director Li 
Thuch said a "positive start" had been made on solving the 
dispute and no more protests would occur. Government officials 
and protestors last week contradicted him. 
  "At this time, this thing is not moving anywhere," said 
Lapresse. 
  Inside Indochina at the end of last week was unable to 
contact TBR company representatives or Rangsi for comment on the 
latest developments. 
  Apart from the market at the centre of this dispute, TBR is 
developing several hotels in Phnom Penh. Early last-month, the 
company donated a 12-seater plane to the Government, according 
to an AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE report published on December 7. 
  A few weeks ago, THE CAMBODIA TIMES newspaper ran a 
full-page 
50th birthday greeting to First Prime Minister Ranariddh "With 
Best Wishes" from Theng Bun Ma and all personnel at TBR. 
  Last week's protesters had a different message for the TBR 
chairman: "We want the Royal Government to settle this dispute 
with Thai Boon Rong company in front of the people," said 
student leader Pich, 30. 
  "We will demonstrate again if there is no solution."

<F P=106> [Article by Atek: "A Personal Dispute that May Have Gone </F>
Too Far"] 
  [Text] An official in the cabinet of the Cambodian 
People's Party [CPP] located near the Chamka Mon state palace 
revealed that the CPP Standing Committee held its so-called 
regular meeting on the afternoon of 19 January. The official, 
who requested anonimity, told us that besides issues directly 
concerning the CPP, the meeting also tackled the problem 
mentioned in the written answer of Mr. Sam Rangsi, minister of 
economy and finance, when he responded to the letter of Mr. 
Theng Bun Ma, chairman of the Thai Boon Rong Company, the 
investor of the new Olympic market. 
  It should be noted that the meeting was attended by several 
important CPP ministers. The official expressed his personal 
opinion "that the content of the written answer by Mr. Sam 
Rangsi to Olympic market investor Theng Bun Ma appeared to be 
going too far beyond an economic perimeter, becoming by itself a 
political issue, and seeming to be of a mudslinging nature," 
although that dispute first took place as a personal matter. 
  It was learned that Mr. Theng Bun Ma wrote a very critical 
letter to Mr. Sam Rangsi, the minister of economy and finance of 
the Kingdom of Cambodia. But it was also learned that Mr. Theng 
Bun Ma is just an ordinary investor. Mr. Sam Rangsi answered 
Mr. Theng Bun Ma in a letter that a CPP official described as 
being part of a purely private squabble using a private 
newspaper as the venue, a squabble which has gone too far and 
which unfortunately has become a new problem that never should 
have been. 
  The dispute between Messrs. Sam Rangsi and Theng Bun Ma up 
through the afternoon of 19 January has not been reported by 
state television, radio, or the government news agency AKP 
although the two gentlemen had already exchanged heated words. 
  Because of the failure of the state media to report it, both 
local and foreign observers in Phnom Penh have concluded that 
this was "merely a personal dispute" that would have no effect 
on the royal government's policy. People are concerned, 
however, that this acute personal dispute might degenarate into 
a rift between groups and might affect the bonds between the two 
ruling parties if no attempt is made to bring about 
understanding and compromise and if no clear line is drawn. 
  When this problem seriously affects the inner bonds between 
the two major parties, it will be said that the dispute hurts 
his majesty the king's national reconciliation policy and the 
royal government as a whole may be shaken. 
  Most analysts believe that the more serious the internal 
rift 
of the government or that of the two major parties in the 
coalition, the greater the gain made by the outlawed Khmer Rouge.

  [Excerpt] On 22 January, at the alliance's suggestion, the 
United Nations sent an Australian representative in charge of 
human rights to Cambodia. 
  Upon arrival in Phnom Penh this UN envoy announced before 
the 
press that he had come to protect the so-called rights of 
Vietnamese nationals in Cambodia. 
  Our Cambodian nation and people clearly see through the 
alliance's scheme in sending this man to Cambodia. It is in 
order to kill our Cambodian nation and race and allow Vietnam to 
annex Cambodia into its Indochinese Federation, thus turning our 
Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom [former Cambodian 
territory annexed by Vietnam]. 
  His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk has been well aware of 
this 
dark design of the alliance. This is why he wrote an important 
essay dated 5 January 1994 entitled: Human rights in Cambodia 
and the Cambodian People's Right to Live Peacefully Forever 
Within Their Legitimate Land and Sea Boundaries as Recognized 
Internationally Between 1963 and 1969. 
  The Cambodian nation and people and the king also well know 
that the two-headed government has not paid attention to the 
King's essay. On the contrary, it has welcomed this 
representative of the bad elements who has come here to kill the 
Cambodian nation and people. [passage omitted]

  [Text] On the night of 24 January, 2,000 people and 600 
ANKI [National Army of Independent Cambodia] soldiers gathered 
in Samraong District of Oddar Meanchey Province. They were 
angry with [FUNCINPEC General] Nhoek Bunchhai, other ANKI 
commanders, puppet commanders Prum Samen, Long Sopheap, and Eng 
Sopheap, commanders of special units Kanti, Di, and Chan, and 
the other evil commanders who have plundered their salaries and 
people's rice and oppressed and forcibly recruited people to 
fight and die on their behalf. The people and soldiers jointly 
attacked these elements who were enjoying their drinking, 
killing or wounding a number of them. Nhoek Bunchhai fled from 
the scene. The people are chasing him. 
  At the same time, the ANKI soldiers deserted the battlefield 
and stopped fighting because they have not been paid, had no 
rice nor medicine, and did not want to die for nothing. They do 
not want to serve the Vietnamese and Vietnamese puppets any 
more. They would rather go back home to farm and earn a living 
for their families than die for the puppets.

  [Text] The ringleaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets 
mobilized 200 Vietnamese puppet soldiers on 21 January and sent 
them to attack a liberated village belonging to the people and 
the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] at K'daoh, on 
the Kulen battlefield in Preah Vihear Province. 
  Aware of the plan in advance, however, the NADK and the 
people were waiting for them. The NADK and the people jointly 
attacked and routed them with assorted primitive and modern 
weapons of every caliber. They killed a captain and seven 
Vietnamese communist puppet soldiers; wounded others; and seized 
two pistols, nine AK rifles, and a quantity of war materiel. 
The survivors retreated in disarray. Many puppet soldiers fled 
to their homes. Having been forcibly recruited, they were 
afraid of being killed and did not want to fight and die for a 
handful of warmongering Vietnamese communist puppets.

Saroeun, Long Sopheap, Prum Samen, and (Oy Sopheap) -- have

water from these sources -- particularly children and old people

them died. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Jakarta, Jan 22 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysian 
International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz has urged 
ASEAN countries not to give in to pressures by big countries to 
change the forum of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation 
(APEC) into a formal institution. 
  Malaysia will not give in to pressures and we hope other 
ASEAN countries will do the same, she said during a dialogue 
session to expose Indonesian businessmen on trade and investment 
opportunities in Malaysia here Friday. 
  Responding to a question on Malaysia's stand towards APEC 
which a dialogue participant said differed to that of other 
ASEAN countries, she said Malaysia had no objection to 
cooperation between Asia and Pacific as it was a loose forum and 
programme and project orientated. 
  What we disagree is turning APEC into a structural and 
formal 
institution, holding summits for country leaders and, with its 
secretariat expanding and no longer programme and project 
orientated, she said. 
  Rafidah, who is leading a 25-member delegation for a two-day 
visit to Indonesia, said ASEAN would lose out if APEC were to be 
a formal institution. 
  Why we don't want it to be so because ASEAN, with its six 
countries, has 320 million people. We have long promoted ASEAN. 
We shouldn't be submerged in Asia-Pacific and losing our voice 
in a formal APEC, she said. 
  It was for this reason, she said, that Malaysia proposed the 
East Asia Economic Caucas (EAEC) with ASEAN as the backbone. 
  Rafidah also called on ASEAN businessmen to be more 
aggresive 
in establishing economic cooperation among them apart from 
intensifying efforts to set up joint venture companies. 
  They should exploit the rapid economic growth in the region, 
like their non-ASEAN counterparts were doing, she said. 
  She said such cooperation was vital in pooling together 
their 
experience, expertise, and financial resources in order to 
compete with non-ASEAN entrepreneurs not only in the region but 
also elsewhere. 
  Earlier, Rafidah held discussions with Trade Minister Satrio 
Judono on bilateral trade as well as regional and global issues. 
  She also met Research and Technology Minister B.J. Habibie 
where she discussed the possiblility of Malaysia participating 
in Indonesia's aviation industry.

  [Text] Indonesia is ready to continue defense and security 
cooperation, particularly military training with Papua New 
Guinea [PNG]. Vice President Try Sutrisno expressed Indonesia's 
readiness to do this during a courtesy call by PNG Defense 
Minister Paul Tohian at his residence on Diponegoro Street in 
Jakarta today. The visit is aimed at enhancing bilateral 
relations, particularly in defense and security. 
  According to Defense Minister Paul Tohian, to enable the 
establishment of a national language, a number of ethnic groups 
in the country, which has a population of four million and 700 
languages, need to be given a new formula. The PNG defense 
minister urged Indonesia to receive a PNG delegation for an APEC 
[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] meeting to be held in 
Jakarta this year. 
  The PNG guest, whose visit will end on 30 January, will 
visit 
the Army Industry, the Nusantara Aircraft Industry, the National 
Shipyard, the Ammunition Plant, and tourist spots in Jakarta and 
Yogyakarta. He will also observe military rural assistance 
programs undertaken by military personnel in Indonesia. He will 
fly from Surabaya to Irian Jaya, where he will visit border 
villages.

cooperation between the two is quite necessary. The consumers 
will be able to evaluate personally the benefits derived from 
the acquisition of new technology. 
  This was stated by Suharto in Jakarta today at the 
simultaneous inauguration of a new gas-powered electron ray 
machine and the exhibition on National Atomic Energy Agency 
[BATAN] achievements during the Fifth Development Program. 
  Taking the opportunity, President Suharto urged industry to 
take advantage of technological progress to increase production. 
  [Begin Suharto recording] The community in general, and the 
industrial sector in particular, need to assimilate and utilize 
new technology so that quality can be improved further and 
production costs reduced. This is important in the effort to 
increase the value of industrial products and creating a more 
competitive atmosphere for medium-scale industries. People 
should also realize that nuclear energy is another important 
potential source of energy. Numerous developed nations have 
benefited from the utilization of nuclear energy. We now need to 
embark on the utilization of nuclear energy because our main 
energy sources are only derived from natural resources, which 
are not unlimited. The natural resources, which are 
irreplaceable, will be depleted soon if we do not utilize them 
sparingly. We should continuously strive to conserve our 
natural resources. Therefore, we should acquire nuclear 
technology because we need to consider the utilization of 
nuclear energy. [end recording] 
  Minister of State for Research and Technology B Habibie 
reported that the establishment of the electron ray machine, 
which will begin operations soon, is for BATAN scientific 
research purposes. The installation of the machine is among 
numerous technologies using radiation. At the beginning, it 
will be used for the production of power cable. The 
U.S.$2-million machine uses technology from China.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, 5 Jan -- Authorities from the Jakarta 
Police Headquaters have arrested 19 students while marching to 
the House of Representatives (DPR) building in Senayan, Jakarta 
on 4 January. The students, who called themselves the Action 
Front of Indonesian Youths (FAPI), intended to see Wahono, House 
Speaker, to protest the arrest of 21 students, and to demand the 
release of their friends who were detained last month. Those 
students had been charged with insulting President Suharto 
during a demonstration in front of the House on 14 December. 
  The new wave of protest by about 40 students criticized the 
harsh "security approach" being used by the government in its 
development efforts. During the protest demonstration, banners 
reading "Security approach is antidemocratic," and "Free our 
friends," were unfurled. 
  Security troops managed to grab some of the demonstrating 
students while others succeeded in getting away. The 
demonstration was eventually dispersed by the mobile brigade of 
the Jakarta Police Headquarters. 
  It was said that Beathor Suryadi, 35, spokesman for FAPI, 
managed to speak to the DPR's public relations officer about the 
matter because Wahono was absent from the House. However, while 
he was trying to do so, his friends who were waiting outside the 
House were arrested. 
  According to Police Lieutenant Colonel Latif Rabar, the 
students were arrested for violating Section 510 of the Criminal 
Code of Law -- for staging demonstration and holding street 
processions without the police permit. 
  He said that at this moment, the arrested students are under 
intensive police investigation. [passage omitted] 
  News of the arrest reached Luhut Pangaribuan, director of 
Jakarta's Legal Aid Bureau. He said that there was no reason to 
arrest the students because they had not broken any law.
