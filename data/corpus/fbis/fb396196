<F P=106> [Statements by Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky </F>
and FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic in Belgrade on 27 
January; recorded -- Jeszenszky speaks in English with 
superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation] 
  [Text] [Jeszenszky] What language shall I use? English? 
Unfortunately I do not speak Serbo-Croatian. Thank you very 
much. However, this is not enough. Well, I had a one-hour 
conversation with President Milosevic and I was glad that Mr. 
[Andros] Agoston, chairman of the Democratic Community of 
Vojvodina Hungarians, attended this conversation on the Serbian 
side. We discussed both bilateral issues and economic ones -- 
how we can work on the resumption of economic relations between 
the two countries, how we should work, and what kind of plans we 
should establish. We should obviously admit that the basic 
problem is economic life, and this is largely as a result of 
sanctions. I have listened very carefully to the president's 
stands and opinions, as well as Minister Jovanovic's on how a 
solution for Bosnia can be found. It is really not for me to 
say whether conditions offered for peace are sufficient, but I 
hope that on the basis of the proposals of the European Union, 
the so-called Juppe-Kinkel proposals, it will be possible to 
bring this conflict to an end. I can see that there is a 
readiness on the Serbian side to adopt these proposals and 
recommendations. 
  With Mr. President I also discussed the question of the 
so-called Krajinas, regions that are close to Hungary, such as 
the Baranja region. We have a large number of refugees from 
Baranja who were forced to flee. I also expressed hope that a 
serious facility such as an oil pipeline should be opened. This 
is very important for Hungary, but also for Yugoslavia. I think 
that the present situation is such that the relations between 
Serbia and Croatia are promising and that this will perhaps 
enable all of us to enjoy the fruits of this facility which was 
in fact a joint investment of the whole of Yugoslavia and 
Hungary. 
  I also think that it is important not only for your and my 
country, but also for Europe that these hostilities end and, as 
I said in an earlier interview, Hungary will be very happy to 
support the lifting of sanctions, but this can only happen when 
it receives international approval. 
  [Jovanovic] It has turned out that with the end of the 
Yugoslav crisis coming nearer, prospects are opening for the 
strengthening of our relations with neighboring countries. The 
arrival of Mr. Jeszenszky here is also the first swallow, the 
harbinger announcing that the end of the crisis is coming closer 
and that the time for beginning the normalization of relations 
with neighboring and other countries is coming. We also had 
this in mind when we examined the prospects of development of 
bilateral relations. We also touched upon the conclusion of 
projects linked with the Belgrade-Budapest-Vienna railroad and 
highway. We also pointed to the geographic-strategic importance 
that the two countries have, being on the road connecting Europe 
and Asia. The interest number one in order that peace returns 
to Bosnia-Herzegovina immediately and that negative developments 
are prevented is for all countries to advocate immediate 
suspension or lifting of sanctions. This is the shortest and 
easiest cure for the belligerent policy that the Muslim 
leadership in Sarajevo persistently carries out at the 
persuasion of forces from outside who see their interests in 
continuing the crisis and continuing the war.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Peter Boross by Josef </F>
Ferenczy; place and date not given: "The Germans Are To Play a 
Greater Role in Europe"] 
  [Text] [Ferenczy] What can the Germans do to deepen the 
growing together of Europe? 
  [Boross] One of the most important events during the 
breakdown of the world system that called itself communist was 
the establishment of German unity. It also resulted in the 
greater international political importance and responsibility of 
the FRG. 
  This responsibility is particularly important today since a 
bloody war is raging in our region and extremist views are 
rousing excessive passions. 
  In our opinion, the economic power, the political weight, 
and 
the geographical situation commit Germany to assuming an even 
more active and courageous role in the interest of European 
stability in Central Europe. 
  The competition between two world powers confronting each 
other was terminated by the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 
However, this leads to a reconsideration of the world's 
security structure. 
  It is above all NATO's task to create it. When we stress 
that European integration is the priority of Hungary's foreign 
policy, we also understand by it our accession to NATO as our 
basic objective. 
  [Ferenczy] Are you concerned about the development in 
Russia? 
  [Boross] It is, of course, vital for Hungary and the whole 
of the international community that the democratic changes in 
Russia cannot be reversed. The newly adopted constitution 
guarantees this. 
  We hope that it will be possible to finally solve the 
political discussions provoked by extremists within the 
framework of laws, by peaceful negotiations, and in the course 
of mutual compromises by the development of the institutional 
system of the new, democratic rule-of-law state. In this way, 
the danger of chaos and civil wars, which, in addition to its 
unpredictable political consequences, would reduce the chances 
for accession to Europe, would be averted. 
  The advance of individual extremist forces in the elections 
is not disastrous, but only a signal, which, however, has to be 
taken seriously. 
  [Ferenczy] Why are politics failing in the Yugoslavia 
conflict? 
  [Boross] The south Slav conflict may involve the following 
dangers for Europe: 
  -- The aggressive war of conquest is again becoming an 
accepted means for the solution of political, ideological, and 
religious differences. 
  -- In the public Western media a mental iron curtain may 
develop, that is to say, the view that Eastern Central Europe is 
to solve its accumulated problems itself because the West does 
not intend to import a bankrupt's estate, could prevail. 
  -- The most serious practical consequence is the influx of 
people who have been expelled from their homeland or are on the 
run to neighboring and developed Western countries -- up to the 
point of a mass movement. As a result of this phenomenon, 
extremist and fascist views and groups might gain ground, which 
is a challenge that has to be taken seriously by the rule-of-law 
states.

<F P=106> [Article by Agnes Bokor based on data of the Szonda-Ipsos </F>
polling agency: "Which Small Party Can Get 200,000 Votes? Six 
Small Parties in the Shadow of Six Big Ones"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We can put the parties in the 
following five groups on the basis of the party list election 
results that can be expected at this time: [passage omitted] 
  1. Those parties that can rightfully count on at least 10 
percent of the vote, that is, those that will certainly be 
parliamentary parties in the next cycle. These are presently 
FIDESZ [Federation of Young Democrats], the MDF [Hungarian 
Democratic Forum], the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party], and the 
SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats]. (The MDF, in whose case it 
is not possible to exclude even a 4- to 10-percent vote result, 
is a borderline case.) 
  2. The other two parliamentary parties, the FKgP 
[Independent 
Smallholders Party] and the KDNP [Christian Democratic People's 
Party] can only hope to get less than 10 percent of the vote, 
but it is very probable that they will get above the 5-percent 
threshold. (The FKgP is a borderline case because in an unusual 
situation, it might get squeezed out of parliament.) 
  3. It is possible that not a single party aside from the six 
above will meet the requirements for getting in. On the basis 
of Szonda-Ipsos's 1993 data, however, we can say that the 
Agrarian Federation, the Republic Party, the Workers Party, the 
Social Democratic Party, the Entrepreneurs Party, and the Green 
Alternative can have some hope of success as they try to expand 
their voter base to the necessary degree. (The Green Alternative 
is on the borderline between groups three and four, mainly 
because, as we will see, those who sympathize with it show 
little intention of taking part [in the election].) 
  4. There are parties, including the United Smallholders 
Party, the Hungarian Interest Party, the MIEP [Hungarian Justice 
and Life Party], the Hungarian Market Party, and the NDSZ 
[National Democratic Federation], whose existence public opinion 
is aware of but whose support is so low according to the 
research data (fewer than 1 percent of the potential voters) 
that only in the most extraordinary situation would they be able 
to get 5 percent of the vote. (Of these parties, MIEP is the one 
whose sympathizers, it can be assumed, are most likely to remain 
hidden in the course of public opinion research; therefore, 
perhaps this party can also be considered a member of the 
previous group.) 
  5. Finally, there are parties whose existence is in effect 
not recognized by the voting public, although they are 
registered parties and even have some members at their disposal. 
People do not mention them in any form, not even occasionally, 
in the course of public opinion research. [passage omitted]

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] The new parliamentary group leader of 
the right-of-center governing party, the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum (MDF), has signaled his party's willingness to join a 
coalition with the opposition Federation of Young Democrats 
(FIDESZ), a liberal party that currently has few seats in 
parliament but has a chance, according to recent polls, of 
winning the spring elections. He also indicated that the media 
misrepresent the new prime minister when they portray him as an 
uncompromising representative of the political right. 
  While Ferenc Kulin, in a 13 January interview in the 
Budapest 
weekly BESZELO, refused to speculate about postelection 
coalition possibilities, he stressed that the MDF would like to 
be able to cooperate with the liberal parties against the 
Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), a successor of the former 
ruling communist Hungarian Socialist Workers Party (MSZMP). 
Desire for such cooperation is a legacy, Kulin indicated, of 
recently deceased Prime Minister Jozsef Antall, who "considered 
it the most important result of the system change, which must 
not be given up and must not be lost, that the country can 
exclude the successor of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party 
when choosing its leading politicians and governing parties." 
FIDESZ, however, is the only liberal party that seems suitable 
for cooperation with the MDF, according to Kulin. The 
long-standing conflict between the liberal Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ) and the MDF, he indicated, has in fact gotten 
worse now that "the SZDSZ creates the impression that it is 
ready to work together with the MSZP. In effect, this 
simplifies our problem, because our two adversaries are merging 
into one. Having said this, I have also answered the question 
of whether I see a difference between the two liberal parties 
[FIDESZ and SZDSZ]. Of course I see a difference, and the 
difference I see is that Fidesz is not preparing to cooperate 
with the successor of the MSZMP. In our system of values, this 
is a basic difference," Kulin said. 
  Kulin also commented about his relationship with Prime 
Minister Boross, asserting that there are no unbridgeable 
differences between his own "national liberal" stance and 
Boross's more conservative views. Charging that the media 
misrepresent Boross, Kulin said that the Boross who is portrayed 
by the press as standing on the right and even "extreme right," 
and who is "allegedly... on close terms with Istvan 
Csurka"--Hungary's leading right-wing extremist, who broke with 
the MDF last year--is "not the Peter Boross that I know." In 
Boross's "whole mentality there are many elements that differ 
from the things that I represent. However, it never occurred to 
me for one minute that Peter Boross, the man who thinks and acts 
with political responsibility, would present me with the kinds 
of dilemmas that Istvan Csurka presented me with.... I do not 
feel any tension between him and me that we would not be able to 
clarify and resolve through a direct dialogue or an exchange of 
views within our party."

  [Text] Instead of devoting their Friday session to 
parliamentary control, on 28 January the National Assembly 
members engaged in regular legislative activity. 
  The Consultative National Security Council, as envisioned in 
the Bulgarian Constitution, finally was fully adopted at a 
second reading. Its functions were finally clarified at the 
National Assembly session. This will not only be an auxiliary 
organ of the president; the council will adopt no obligatory 
stands or proposals addressed at other institutions. 
  The clarification of the council's functions again posed the 
old disputed issue of its composition. This issue was discussed 
amid growing tension until the end of the session. According to 
the Constitution, the president of the Republic is chairman of 
the council. The prime minister, the four ministers most 
directly involved in security issues, the chief of the General 
Staff, the National Assembly chairman, and one representative 
from each parliamentary faction also are members of the council. 
No changes in this permanent composition were adopted, despite 
the fact that there were many new proposals.

  [Text] A total agreement was reached on all issues that 
were discussed, Defense Minister Aleksandrov said upon his 
return from Romania, where he had talks with his counterpart, 
Nicolae Spiroiu. 
  Refraining by all means from interfering in the Yugoslav 
conflict and a total support of the Yugoembargo was the joint 
position of the two defense ministers. Regarding the war in 
former Yugoslavia, the opinion was expressed that diplomatic 
means to stop the war are far from being exhausted.

<F P=106> [Plamen Kulinski commentary: "Policy of Noninterference"] </F>
  [Text] The disintegration of Yugoslavia, predetermined by 
its very creation, has tangled the Balkans in a knot that even 
the most skillful fingers cannot untie. However, there are many 
people willing to do this. They know what benefits they might 
reap. However, those who are most interested in the success of 
the experiment prefer to keep a low profile. 
  There is a real danger of the conflict spreading to other 
Balkan territories. The Americans comfortably deployed their 
units in Macedonia in an attempt to prevent this. However, they 
did not dare send their boys to Bosnia-Herzegovina. They do, 
however, have ideas about how to resolve the situation there -- 
the airplanes will come and everything will be all right. The 
Islamic states also know precisely what they want -- a new 
Muslim state in the heart of Europe that could become a new 
Mecca. 
  Against this background one fails to comprehend the 
passivity 
of some neighbors of the former Yugoslavia, who should have 
perhaps the clearest position on resolving the conflict. Those 
who engage in concocting futile plans should take into 
consideration the opinion of those neighbors, because it is 
their house that will be on the line if the situation eventually 
explodes. 
  Perhaps Sofia is the best example in this respect. Somehow 
its position remains unclear. Why? Perhaps because Sofia is 
concerned that its opinion might affect other countries involved 
in the Balkan crisis. Noninterference is a comfortable policy 
in such cases. While waiting for the storm to pass however, 
Sofia has lost millions of green banknotes. Nevertheless, in 
the long run this could be the least of our losses.

  [Text] Bijeljina, Bosnia, Jan 31 (AFP) -- Russian 
ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy arrived on Monday 
in Bijeljina, northeastern Bosnia, for talks with leaders of the 
self-declared Bosnian Serb republic. 
  Some 2,000 to 3,000 people, many in uniform, were waiting to 
greet the rightwing Liberal Democratic Party leader, who is 
making a tour of parts of former Yugoslavia, including 
Serb-controlled regions of Croatia and Bosnia, an AFP 
correspondent said. 
  He was officially welcomed by the self-proclaimed president 
of the Serb Republic of Bosnia, Radovan Karadzic, Biljana 
Plavsic, from the collegial presidency and Aleksa Buha, a member 
of the government. Karadzic introduced Zhirinovskiy to a 
Russian volunteer fighting on the Tuzla front in northeast 
Bosnia. "The Russians have already arrived. They are coming on 
their own, it is a sign of Russia's goodwill," Zhirinovskiy said. 
  Zhirinovskiy was later scheduled to visit Vukovar in the 
self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina in Croatia to meet 
the newly-elected self-styled president Milan Martic. 
  Zhirinovskiy warned on arrival in Belgrade on Sunday that 
airstrikes against the Serbs would be considered an attack by 
the west on Russia itself. 
  Attacks by NATO warplanes or UN troops on Serb positions 
anywhere in Bosnia or other areas of the former Yugoslavia 
"would be tantamount to a declaration of war on Russia," he 
said. "It's better that Europe not learn what retaliatory 
measurs we could take," he told a press conference. 
  He also called for UN troops to be pulled out of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and "let the Serbs settle the matter 
themselves." 
  Zhirinovskiy arrived here from Serbia after traveling 
through 
Hungary following a stormy tour of Slovenia, during which he was 
invited to leave by the government for causing a public 
disturbance and suggesting the independent republic should be 
reincorporated into rump Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Bijeljina, 31 Jan (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, arrived in 
Bijeljina shortly before 1100. Outside the municipal assembly 
building he was welcomed by Radovan Karadzic, president of the 
Srpska republic, and by Prime Minister Vladimir Lukic. 
  Greetings were exchanged during a cordial meeting and on 
this 
occasion Zhirinovskiy told Karadzic that wherever he goes he 
finds "proofs and monuments indicating that the Serb nation is a 
historic nation." 
  The host and his guest then went to the municipal assembly 
building where talks are to be held. More than 10,000 people 
have been waiting at the city square in Bijeljina since early 
this morning to hear Zhirinovskiy and Karadzic speak.

  [Text] Belgrade, 31 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Supreme Command of 
the Srpska republic army says in a statement sent to TANJUG last 
night that "given the fact that the international community has 
decided to support the Muslims in the war and recognize the 
results of their struggle, the Supreme Command of the Srpska 
republic army (VRS) has passed a number of decisions and 
measures within its scope aiming at the mobilization of all 
available forces in the Srpska republic for the purpose of 
bringing about a successful end to the war. This means that the 
results of the struggle should be recognized: not only those of 
the Muslim side, but also those of all the sides in the conflict. 
  "The Supreme Command adopted a decision about strict legal 
measures against deserters and all other persons avoiding 
military service, especially those who do not report to their 
local commands or army units at the earliest opportunity. 
  "The economy of the Srpska republic will be placed entirely 
at the disposal of the republic's defense. 
  "The entire able-bodied population will be mobilized into 
war 
or work units, and special women's units will be set up with the 
aim of bringing about a successful end to the war. 
  "All forms of illegal trade and black marketeering, 
especially with the enemy, will be severely punished. 
  "Disciplinary measures have been intensified within the VRS 
and in the internal affairs' organs [police], as well as against 
all those involved in the defense, security, and protection of 
the constitutional order. [sentence as received] 
  "All state organs must function in accordance with their 
constitutional and legal role, bringing all forms of criminal, 
moral, disciplinary, and other proceedings in line with 
conditions of an immediate risk of war. 
  "The Supreme Command has undertaken all measures ensuring 
and 
guaranteeing full security for citizens and their property. 
  "New measures have been taken within the organization of the 
VRS in line with the defense needs of all of the Srpska republic 
territory, ensuring flexibility, efficiency, and the better 
equiping of the army's units. 
  "The Supreme Command also adopted other decisions to ensure 
that the fundamental right and the sacred duty of citizens will 
be implemented: to defend the sovereignty, territory, and 
constitutional order of the Srpska republic. 
  "The new measures of the VRS Supreme Command will secure 
victory over the enemy and preserve all of the gains of the 
Serbian people's struggle to date, based on the principles of 
sovereignty, democracy, and freedom of the people in the Srpska 
republic," the statement concludes.

  [Text] We have just received the announcement issued from 
the session of the Presidency of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina held today and chaired by Alija Izetbegovic, 
president of the Presidency. 
  The Presidency examined and adopted the report by President 
Alija Izetbegovic on his visit to Malaysia, Indonesia, and 
Brunei. Examining the situation regarding peace negotiations on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Presidency supported the initiative for 
holding a Security Council session that would discuss the 
situation in our country. If such a session does take place, the 
Presidency assumes that the Security Council will reaffirm all 
its resolutions on Bosnia-Herzegovina adopted so far as well as 
the London Conference decisions. 
  Mutual recognition of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia and 
Montenegro is being proposed, considering this to be a way to 
make a new contribution to solving the crisis on the territory 
of the former Yugoslavia. The report by Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic and Army General Rasim Delic, commander of the General 
Staff of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the 
talks at Sarajevo airport was also adopted at today's session. 
  Discussing the situation in the Bosnian Krajina, the 
Presidency decided to consider the initiative of a large number 
of former supporters of Fikret Abdic and to adopt an ordinance 
with legal power about an amnesty. According to this ordinance, 
no criminal prosecution will be instigated against members of 
Fikret Abdic's paramilitary formations, as well as members of 
parastate organs of the so-called Autonomous Province of Western 
Bosnia, who report to the legal organs of power of the Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina by 10 February. 
  Regarding the crime in Zenica on which occasion a UNHCR 
member, a British citizen, was killed, the Presidency expresses 
its condolences and the resolution to have the people who 
committed this crime found and punished. 
  Consent was given for the ambassadors of the Kingdom of 
Sweden, the Republic of Austria, and the Republic of Albania to 
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Presidency adopted the 
decision on the election and release of a number of people 
holding posts in the judiciary.

<F P=106> [Article by Victoria Stegic] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, Jan 30 (AFP) -- Bosnian General Jovan 
Divjak has warned that any withdrawal of United Nations 
peacekeepers from the former Yugoslavia would spark a tinderbox 
in the Balkans in the face of rampant Serbian nationalism. 
  In an interview with AFP, Divjak, one of two deputy 
chiefs-of-staff in the Bosnian Army, deplored the "lack of 
determination" shown by the United States and the 
"irresponsibility" of the European Community, whose negotiator 
Lord Owen has been trying to broker a three-way carve-up of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  With the present balance of forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
any 
UN withdrawal would "only put a match to the powderkeg the 
Balkans have become," he said. 
  Divjak said the Bosnian Army was "poorly armed, starved of 
logistical back-up, but well motivated," and would carry out the 
political objectives it had been assigned. 
  "Despite protestations of peace, the three parties continue 
to clash on the ground, because the Serbs and the Croats have 
not yet completed the boundaries of their quasi-states, while 
the Bosnian government is seeking to recapture the territory 
taken from it by force." 
  He said the Bosnian Croat HVO [Croatian Defense Council] 
forces were trying to forge a corridor in central Bosnia linking 
the towns of Prozor, Gornji Vakuf and Travnik with Vitez and 
Busovaca. Some 14,000 soldiers from Croatia with around 40 
tanks, helicopters and aircraft had reinforced the HVO troops, 
Divjak said. But he vowed that the "Bosnian Croats and Croatia 
will be the biggest losers in this war." 
  A former officer in the defunct Yugoslav army, Divjak, 
himself of Serb origin, predicted that "without a strong 
multi-national Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia cannot survive." 
Serbia's expansionist appetite was not limited to Bosnia, he 
said, pointing out that Serbs already controlled a quarter of 
Croatian territory. The Bosnian Serbs were fielding 80,000 men, 
25,000 of whom had come from Serbia, he said. 
  Backed by at least 500 tanks, they were trying to establish 
a 
corridor running from northwest to southeast along the Krivaja 
valley, which was why they were currently attacking the 
Moslem-held town of Olovo, on the Krivaja River some 30 
kilometres (18 miles) northeast of Sarajevo. 
  "The Serbs are not interested in Olovo itself," Divjak said. 
"What they want is to advance up the valley towards Vozuca and 
Maglaj (which are held by the Bosnian Army) to link up with 
(Serb-held) Doboj." That way they would drive a wedge between 
the second and third Bosnian Army corps, he said. 
  Sarajevo itself was in a bad way, he admitted. "Not one 
single weapon has got into Sarajevo since November 1992," he 
said. It was now more than a year and a half since the Bosnian 
forces had managed to destroy any of the 80 Serb tanks training 
their guns on the city. 
  More firepower was aimed at Sarajevo than had been deployed 
to pound Berlin into surrender at the end of World War Two, he 
said, with some 1,500 artillery pieces ranged against the city. 
By contrast, Sarajevo had not more than 20 artillery pieces, no 
mortars, no ammunition, few weapons and only a few home-made 
handgrenades with which to defend itself. "We are putting the 
emphasis on diversionary tactics," he said. 
  He said airstrikes against Serb positions would help ease 
the 
situation. "It would be enough, by way of reprisals, to bomb 
their mechanised units and tanks, their ammunition dumps, and to 
knock out the 20 or so bridges across the Drina River between 
Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina." One thing was certain, he said. 
"The war will not end tomorrow."

  [Text] Sarajevo, 30 Jan (TANJUG) -- I expressed my 
gratitude to President Karadzic for his help and cooperation in 
ensuring unhindered deliveries of humanitarian aid by land 
corridors passing across this territory, British general Michael 
Rose, the newly appointed UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] 
commander for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, said after his meeting 
today with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic. 
  "The talks were very interesting and comprehensive and 
referred to the situation on the ground, the humanitarian 
situation and the mandate of the UN peace mission in this 
connection." 
  Expressing satisfaction about today's meeting with Rose at 
the start of the latter's mission in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Karadzic said the aim of the meeting was for the two sides to 
get to know each other and explain their basic points of view. 
  "My impression is that regardless of where they come from, 
high-ranking officers are the ones least prejudiced. Such was 
the case with all former UNPROFOR commanders and so it is with 
General Rose, who is willing to examine the situation as a whole 
and take an unbiased stand which the United Nations personifies. 
We have always been satisfied with the UN high commands and 
have never had any objections to their work," the Srpska 
republic president said. 
  "General Rose expressed satisfaction about the safe passage 
of convoys across the Serb territory and about the reduced 
volume of military operations in the Sarajevo zone. We accepted 
the suggestion that such a trend should be continued, especially 
at the time of the Olympics and we also accepted a cease-fire 
during this period and will not carry out any military 
operations unless we are threatened. 
  "We will try to ensure an increase in humanitarian aid 
deliveries through our corridors, as our aim is to lessen the 
suffering of civilians as much as possible. My impression is 
that our first meeting took place in a very positive atmosphere 
and I hope that our cooperation will be excellent," Karadzic 
concluded. 
  General Rose said: "We agreed on the need to make an effort 
to normalize the situation in Sarajevo and to halt military 
actions in the Sarajevo area. I think it is in the interest of 
all of us that the situation is normalized, given the 
unfortunate experiences of the people living here." 
  He confirmed that the process of replacing UNPROFOR members 
in Srebrenica was discussed, and expressed conviction that the 
rotation would be completed without any problems. 
  President Karadzic mentioned that he and Rose also discussed 
possible dangers which could arise from deliberately staged 
incidents, especially within the context of the provocations 
announced by Muslim forces in connection with NATO planes in 
northeast Bosnia, particularly in Tuzla and Srebrenica. 
  "We agreed that in such a situation we should have each 
individual case examined by mixed expert groups, because such 
tricks on the part of the Muslim side are very likely. We will 
try to prevent this, but if it happens we will insist on a 
thorough investigation and will be willing to take part in the 
work of the mixed expert commissions," Karadzic said. 
  "The protection of humanitarian aid routes is within the 
mandate of the peace forces and we are aware of the difficulties 
and traps which can present themselves, but we will conduct an 
investigation in every case and I therefore stress the 
importance of the deliveries of humanitarian aid across these 
areas," General Rose said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 30 Jan (TANJUG) -- General Michael Rose, 
UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] commander for former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Lieutenant General Ratko Mladic, 
commander of the army of the Srpska republic, had talks in Pale 
this afternoon. 
  After the meeting General Rose told journalists he was 
pleased with the meeting today. "The talks were interesting and 
related to an exchange of views on issues of interest to both 
sides," he said. 
  Speaking about the specific content of the talks today, 
General Mladic said: "General Rose presented vague claims in 
connection with some issues but they were clarified by the Serb 
side." 
  "I explained the same to General Briquemont. The rotation of 
UNPROFOR troops in Srebrenica falls within the competence of 
lower-ranking UNPROFOR commanders and it should not be blown up 
out of proportion, because that is precisely what Muslims and 
all those who are sponsoring them want in creating a smokescreen 
for the world public in order to conceal the Croat-Muslim war," 
Mladic said. 
  "As regards Tuzla airport, this is a concocted problem 
serving the same purpose, but the smokescreen is much thicker 
and bigger. There is no reason why we should haggle over this 
issue, as all the convoys can enter both Srebrenica and Tuzla as 
they please," Mladic said. 
  "However, Muslims have got bad advisers and think that we 
are 
naive and will easily swallow their bait. I informed General 
Rose about the fact that the Muslims and Croats declared war on 
the Serb people. Let them take it back; it will be easy to find 
a speedy agreement on everything, including Tuzla. There are 
also airports on Serb territory. Serbs cannot even receive 
vaccines for babies while the Muslims can even seek to control 
all international airports. We will talk about this with the 
warring sides," Mladic said. 
  "We have never had any conflicts with UNPROFOR commanders, 
nor with any generals, because it was not the United Nations 
that declared war on us, but Tudjman and Izetbegovic," the Serb 
commander concluded.

  [Excerpt] Bilateral talks between a Bosnia-Herzegovina 
delegation and the Serb side were held today. Upon his return 
from the airport, Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic, who led our delegation, stated the following about 
the content and results of today's talks. Here is a report by 
Senada Cumurovic: 
  [Begin recording] [Cumurovic] Head of the ICRC 
[International 
Committee of the Red Cross] for former Yugoslavia Andre Collomb 
also attended the talks today. What was the reason? 
  [Silajdzic] Collomb was there to point at the serious 
situation and express deep concern felt by the Red Cross due to 
the deterioration of the situation. Their concern is justified. 
We, of course, accepted that as it was. On the other hand, he 
[words indistinct] to initiate the process of POW exchanges. In 
brief, we agreed that what was possible to do in the 
humanitarian sphere should be done, what is impossible to do now 
should be left for later. [words indistinct] We shall try to 
speed up work on that as every day is important for these 
people. This is as regards Mr. Collomb's participation. 
  After that we had bilateral talks. Of course, as regards the 
humanitarian situation, we first had talks on convoys in 
general, and then on a particular convoy which has been waiting 
in Zenica for a long time to pass through to Maglaj. If you can 
recall those two parallel convoys from Croatia which [Croatian 
Foreign Minister] Granic and myself agreed for Nova Bila and 
Maglaj. A part of the convoy is still waiting in Zenica to pass 
through; today we learned that the Serb side would not make 
problems for the passage of the convoy through the Serb-held 
territory. Of course, we have to obtain consent of the Croat 
side. We need not stress the importance of it. I think that 
the situation in Maglaj and Tesanj is dramatic. In addition to 
convoys, we shall try to parachute the aid there. 
  [Cumurovic] The impression of our delegation members who 
took 
part in the talks is that the political negotiations were held 
in a more favorable atmosphere. Why do that feel that way? 
  [Silajdzic] Simply because there was readiness to view all 
options equally. Certain specific agreements have been reached, 
and when concrete agreements are present the situation is always 
easier and it is possible to discuss everything in a different 
way. 
  I will say it straight away. It was agreed to form a joint 
commission to go to Gorazde in order to spread the atmosphere 
concerning measures for building confidence; in Gorazde, Foca, 
and Cajnice. [We discussed] especially the supplies of water and 
electricity, therefore, the repair of power lines and, of 
course, the most difficult topic is always the exchange of 
prisoners (?on that side). 
  The second topic which we seriously discussed are the 
possibilities of improving the communications between Sarajevo 
and other areas via Visoko or Hadzici. We held talks in 
principle, but they were held in an atmosphere which could lead 
to an agreement on improving communications links, on leaving 
and entering Sarajevo, the return to (?northern and) southern 
parts of the republic. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, 29 Jan (TANJUG) -- I have to say that 
after all there is a certain degree of optimism, Momcilo 
Krajisnik, president of the people's assembly of the Srpska 
republic, said this evening after five hours of talks with Haris 
Silajdzic, prime minister of the Muslim government in Sarajevo. 
  Krajisnik headed a Srpska republic delegation at the talks 
with the Muslim side at Sarajevo Airport. He specified that the 
two sides had discussed the exchange and release of prisoners 
and the situation following the arrest of Serb medical personnel 
in the Muslim part of Sarajevo. 
  "There were certain political topics on the agenda too," 
Krajisnik added. He said that both sides agreed to exchange 85 
prisoners each, and that the Serbs again pointed to the problem 
of prisons in Gorazde [in eastern Bosnia] and Tarcin [southwest 
of Sarajevo]. 
  The talks were also attended by a representative of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC], so it was 
agreed that, with the mediation and participation of that 
humanitarian organization, a mixed Serb-Muslim delegation should 
visit the prison in Gorazde, while, according to Krajisnik, 
"there are mutual problems" concerning Tarcin. 
  He explained that the families of the Serbs held in Tarcin 
prevent humanitarian aid convoys from reaching the territories 
under Muslim control, making their passage conditional on the 
release of the prisoners from Tarcin. It was agreed that a 
Srpska republic representative should go to Tarcin with ICRC 
officials and, if possible, arrange an exchange of prisoners, 
Krajisnik said. 
  He added that the ICRC got involved in the case of the Serb 
doctors held in the Central Prison in Sarajevo, but that the 
Muslim side had started making their release conditional on 
"reciprocal measures." 
  "If there are Muslim doctors on our territory who would like 
to cross to their territory, we are ready to resolve this matter 
immediately," Krajisnik said. He reiterated that the arrest of 
the Serb doctors was an extremely unreasonable act, adding that 
he was hoping the problem would be resolved soon. 
  Revealing more details on political topics discussed at the 
meeting today, the speaker of the People's Assembly of the 
Srpska republic mentioned an idea presented by Silajdzic that in 
this phase hostilities should cease, or maybe even complete 
peace be restored, separation lines between warring sides be 
drawn up along the present front lines, and the civilian 
population be allowed to move freely between Visoko and 
Sarajevo, Sarajevo and Tarcin, and also along roads leading from 
Sarajevo to the Serb-controlled territories. 
  "I have the impression that the Muslim side wants a 
cease-fire, which is encouraging, especially if they adhere to 
these standpoints following additional consultations," Krajisnik 
stated. According to him, this would not only be an act of 
restoring trust, but would also create a climate in which 
political negotiations on all contentious issues would continue 
in an atmosphere of peace, not under war conditions. 
  Krajisnik also expressed reservations in this connection, 
stressing that he had clearly told the Muslim side that what 
might be lurking behind this proposal was the aim of buying time 
to obtain certain military advantages such as further armament, 
and mopping up the front facing the Croat side. "We shall accept 
an invitation for peace, preferably for a permanent peace, but I 
clearly told Silajdzic we had doubts about the peace-making 
intentions of a part of the Muslim leadership, which is trying 
to resolve the situation through the war," Krajisnik said. 
  The Srpska republic assembly speaker stressed that he had 
drawn the Muslim side's attention to the fact that the Serbs 
were ready to accept any military challenge, and that they could 
not be swindled and cheated. In conclusion Krajisnik said that 
an agreement was reached for the two delegations to meet once 
again before 10 February, about which they would be in phone 
contact as phone lines between the two sides are restored. He 
explained that all this is aimed at overcoming distrust through 
direct contacts, "so that the atmosphere ahead of the 
forthcoming round of Geneva negotiations is as favorable as 
possible."

  [Text] The political department of the Defense Ministry of 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna has issued a statement in 
response to a letter to UN Security Council Chairman Karel 
Kovanda by Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, in which he 
accused the Republic of Croatia of allegedly sending its regular 
units to take part in military actions in the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Silajdzic's letter is completely unfounded, 
and it is yet another attempt to turn the attention of the 
international public away from the true problem, which is the 
Muslim army's continued aggression against the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Muslims' persistence in continuing 
the war. This is the gist of the statement. 
  We declare that there are no regular units of the Croatian 
Army in the territory of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and 
that the political leadership of Herceg-Bosna has never asked 
the Croatian Army and leaders to send Croatian Army units to 
Herceg-Bosna. 
  It is true that the authorities of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna have sent a call-up to all able-bodied citizens of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina of Croat nationality -- including members of 
the Croatian Army born in Bosnia-Herzegovina who volunteered for 
the Croatian Army at the beginning of the aggression against 
Croatia -- to join HVO [Croatian Defense Council] units in the 
defense of their people and their historic areas. Before 
joining HVO units, all volunteers from the Croatian Army born in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina were demobilized from the Croatian Army; that 
is, they left its ranks. The truth is only that HVO units are 
much better manned due to a good turnout of citizens of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina of Croat nationality who stayed in Croatia, 
the statement says.

are continuing their fierce attacks in the direction of Gornji 
Vakuf and the river Lasva valley, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's 
press center has announced. 
  Fighters from Sibenik, Osijek, Vukovar, Vinkovci, Varazdin, 
and Zagreb are amassing around Gornji Vakuf with constant 
artillery support. Zagreb's assurances that these are not 
Croatian Army units, but volunteers from Bosnia were already 
heard at the beginning of the Serb aggression against the 
internationally recognized Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tesanj--There have been more victims of exhaustion 
and hunger on the free Teslic territories. This time it is the 
case of two older people, whom even the doctors unfortunately 
could not help. They died from starvation. Let me remind you: 
The last convoy with humanitarian aid that reached this region 
was exactly seven months ago. Starvation and exhaustion have 
also claimed dozens of lives on the free Doboj territories. 
Almost 20,000 elderly, women, and children are facing death. 
  The situation is particularly hard in Matuzici, Ularice, 
Alibegovci, Mravici, [word indistinct], Mala Brijesnica and 
Velika Brijesnica, Kokotnica, and other places on the free 
territory. Over the last seven months, only two kilograms of 
flour per household have been distributed here. 
  There is a real humanitarian catastrophe on the Maglaj 
territory, too. Tesanj, with 20,000 refugees from Doboj and 
Teslic, has also been for a long time been without food, 
electricity, fuel, and warm clothes.

convoys organized by the Banja Luka delegation of the ICRC 
[International Committee of the Red Cross], which have been 
suspended since 17 January this year, will start running again 
today, a TANJUG correspondent has learned. 
  A convoy for the local population will arrive in [Serb-held] 
Banja Luka today, as well as another one destined for 
[Muslim-held] Zenica. Both have been inspected at the border 
crossing [between Croatia and Bosnia] in [former Bosanska] 
Gradiska on the river Sava. 
  As has been reported, the Banja Luka delegation of the ICRC 
temporarily suspended aid deliveries following the incident when 
an explosive device was planted under an ICRC vehicle [in Banja 
Luka] on 17 January this year.

  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 29 (TANJUG) -- Officials of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on January 23 
visited five Serb doctors and three nurses held by the Moslems 
in Sarajevo for allegedly attempting to flee a Moslem quarter of 
the city. 
  The ICRC said in a letter to the Health Ministry of the 
Bosnian Serb Republic on Saturday that the arrested medical 
workers were allowed to contact their families through the ICRC. 
  Health Minister Dragan Kalinic on Saturday sent a letter to 
the coordinator for medical evacuations of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees threatening to suspend cooperation in 
response to this inhumane and criminal act. The health 
authorities of the Bosnian Serb republic will suspend all 
medical evacuations until the arrested doctors and nurses have 
been uncondtionally released and allowed to freely enter Serb 
territory, said Kalinic. 
  Speaker of the Bosnian Serb Parliament Momcilo Krajisnik and 
Bosnian Moslem Premier Haris Silajdzic met at Sarajevo Airport 
on Sunday [as received] afternoon for talks on rebuilding 
confidence among the warring sides and releasing the Serb 
doctors and nurses from the central Moslem prison in Sarajevo. 
  Until they were arrested, the doctors and nurses worked in 
Moslem-controlled hospitals in Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Report by Milenko Ilic] </F>
  [Text] [Studio announcer] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, 
president of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, today 
arrived in Subotica from Slovenia. He should be arriving in 
Belgrade this evening. 
  [Ilic] Currently the most controversial person on the 
international political scene, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of 
the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, arrived this afternoon 
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at the invitation of the 
Serbian Democratic Party of all Serbian Lands and the 
Serbian-Russian Friendship Society. He was welcomed at the 
Hungarian-Yugoslav border crossing by Radomir Smiljanic. 
Expressing thanks for the welcome, Zhirinovskiy said that he 
was happy that he had stepped onto Serbian soil, onto the 
beginning of the Slav world, and that he was among the people 
who are today fervently fighting for all the Slavs. 
  After a brief traditional Orthodox ceremony, Zhirinovskiy 
went to Subotica, where he was greeted by many citizens. 
Addressing them, he said: I am coming to your country for the 
first time, but I am coming here as a representative of the 
victorious party at the Russian elections, as a representative 
of Russia, which has chosen a new course. This course is the 
obligation of Russia to help the brotherly Serbian people. Our 
enemies are our common enemies and you ought to know that they 
will be punished for all the evils committed against the Slav 
people. 
  A new era is beginning, Zhirinovskiy said. His words were 
accompanied with chanting: Russia, Serbia. He stressed that the 
enemies of the Slav people are now trembling in Paris, Bonn, 
London, and Washington. 
  Commenting on the war the Serbian people are waging on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia, Zhirinovskiy said that all 
the barbarians that have settled on the sacred Serbian soil must 
accept the fact that this land belongs to the Serbian people, or 
leave it. 
  After a brief stop in a big restaurant in Subotica, Agros 
Centar, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy continued his journey to Belgrade, 
where he will hold a news conference. According to the plan, 
Zhirinovskiy will visit Bijeljina as a guest of the republic of 
Srpska, and then meet Milan Martic, newly elected president of 
the republic of Serbian Krajina, in Vukovar.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, Jan 30 (TANJUG) -- Army of Yugoslavia (VJ) 
chief of general staff, General Momcilo Perisic on Sunday denied 
the allegations that VJ units were fighting on the side of the 
Bosnian Serbs in the war-torn former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  I claim that not a single unit of the army of Yugoslavia has 
crossed into or is fighting in either the Serb republic (RS) 
(the state of the Bosnian Serbs) or in the republic of Serb 
Krajina (RSK) (The serb state within the administrative borders 
of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia)," [quotation marks 
as received] General Perisic said on Radio Kragujevac. He said 
there was no organized departure of the Army of Yugoslavia for 
the RS, and there would be none in the foreseeable future. The 
U.N. and the U.S. Administration, themselves, have said that 
there is no evidence that VJ units are engaged in the fighting 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Asked to comment the NATO threats that it will launch air 
strikes against Bosnian Serb positions, General Perisic said he 
did not think the air strikes would take place since he said 
what was involved were threats and pressure from the architects 
of the so-called new world order. 
  The VJ chief of general staff said the use of any 
significant 
forces in the air in Bosnia-Herzegovina would produce small 
results militarily and would not secure the desired goal. If 
such strikes are launched, however, I think that Serbs in the 
RS, especially their military leaders, are wise enough to avoid 
the strikes, that is, place themselves in a position in which 
they would maximally be protected, General Perisic said. 
  Asked about the possibility of the war spilling over into 
the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Perisic said the forces which 
had undertaken to destroy the states on the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia wanted to apply the same scenario to the 
territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia using, among 
other things, on the basis of the same principle applied so far, 
internal factors which have directly placed themselves in the 
service of those forces and were working for their interests. 
  It is for that reason that the situation in the F.R.Y. is 
very complex, and it is only thanks to the extremely wisely 
conducted policy that the scenario has not been applied on its 
territory. We must constantly be aware of that, of the fact 
that the enemy's ultimate goal is to place the Serb and 
Montengrin peoples in the position of the Palestinian people, 
that is, of a people without its own state. It is quite clear 
to everyone what has been and what is the faith of peoples with 
no state, General Perisic set out. 
  Asked whether it was possible for the war to escalate and 
spread to other parts of the Balkans, General Perisic said the 
architects of the "new world order" had caused the war on the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia and for the time being, since 
the war had acquired such proportions and gotten out of their 
control, they feared the most that it could acquire proportions 
which would threaten Europe and the world. 
  Faced with the unexpected resistance by the Serb people on 
the territory of the former Yugoslavia, the architects of the 
"new world order" are now afraid of a war on a larger scale, all 
the more so since they can no longer control it, just as they 
cannot Croatia's intervention on Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, 
or the activities of Muslim forces, General Perisic said. 
  Roughly 60,000 of Croatia's regular army troops have been 
engaged in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina since it broke 
out in April 1992. The three warring sides in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are the local Muslims, Serbs and Croats.

  [Text] While the United Nations and the West are debating 
air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, those very Serbs seem to 
be preparing a large-scale offensive in the coming weeks. 
Information gathered from several sources in Belgrade seems to 
indicate this. In particular, we have been receiving reports of 
the mobilization of Serbian refugees in the rump Yugoslavia, who 
are being called up by the Serbian armies in Bosnia and Krajina. 
Belgrade authorities are denying all involvement in this 
mobilization, but the High Commission for Refugees in Belgrade 
believes that the operation would be impossible without the 
collaboration of the local authorities. Florence Hartmann [LE 
MONDE correspondent in Belgrade] reports: 
  [Begin Hartmann recording] A form with the heading -- Your 
Country Calls On You -- is being sent out to Bosnian [Serb] 
refugees in Serbia and Montenegro calling them back to serve on 
the front. Suffering from a shortage of manpower, the Bosnian 
Serbs are recruiting with the help of threats and with 
Belgrade's backing. Those who do not answer the call-up will 
lose their refugee status and could even face a prison sentence. 
Defying international conventions, the civilian and military 
authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are providing 
lists of refugees, distributing call-up papers and transferring 
the troops to the combat zones. The Belgrade authorities are 
nevertheless officially denying their collaboration in this 
activity. For now, we are unable to estimate the scope of this 
mobilization, but several hundred called-up refugees have 
alerted the UNHCR to the situation. The UN is advising them to 
stay in hiding. Several refugee shelters in Serbia and 
Montenegro have been deserted in recent days by all men of 
fighting age; or rather by all men of any age, since the call-up 
also includes refugees of 60 as well as men exempted from 
military duties for medical reasons. 
  Having failed to obtain a [Muslim] signature on the Bosnia 
peace plan, the Serbs seem decided to inflict total defeat on 
the Muslim side.

  [Text] Belgrade, 28 Jan (TANJUG)--It is with pleasure that 
Hungary will uphold the lifting of the sanctions adversely 
affecting not only the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia but 
Hungary as well, Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky told 
FRY Prime Minister Radoje Kontic today. Federal Prime Minister 
Kontic received the Hungarian foreign minister at the Palace of 
the Federation today. The meeting was also attended by Federal 
Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic. 
  Views were exchanged on bilateral relations between the FRY 
and Hungary, stability in the Balkans, and the consequences of 
the unjustly imposed sanctions. The two sides expressed mutual 
interest in the development of good-neighborly relations and the 
desire to resolve all disputes through dialogue. 
  "Yugoslavia is firmly determined to settle all disputed 
issues in a peaceful way", the Yugoslav prime minister pointed 
out. The prime minister also stressed that relations with 
neighbors were a priority in Yugoslavia's foreign policy, 
emphasizing that national minorities should be bridges of 
cooperation, not causes for confrontation. Consequently, all 
national minorities in the FRY -- including members of the 
Hungarian minority -- are enjoying and will continue to enjoy 
all rights in conformity with the highest international 
standards, Kontic stressed. He informed Minister Jeszenszky 
about the effects of the unjustly imposed sanctions and said 
there were no longer any reasons for maintaining them. 
  Hungarian Foreign Minister Jeszenszky conveyed his 
government's interest in maintaining good-neighborly relations 
with the FRY and expressed his conviction that they will be even 
more beneficial in the future. Jeszenszky believes that peace 
in former Bosnia-Herzegovina was now closer at hand than ever 
before and assessed that the FRY was making a significant 
contribution to this effect. 
  The two sides also discussed economic cooperation, 
especially 
after the sanctions. 
  Prime Minister Kontic extended an invitation to the 
Hungarian 
prime minister to visit Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Belgrade, 28 Jan (TANJUG) -- "We attach exceptional 
importance to your visit and see it as a sign of growing mutual 
respect and understanding between our two countries", said FRY 
President Zoran Lilic during his meeting with Hungarian Foreign 
Minister Geza Jeszenszky. According to the FRY president's 
general secretariat [as received], President Lilic added that it 
is the FRY's desire that this visit should to be an important 
step in the promotion of bilateral relations, especially in the 
sphere of economic cooperation which is of great importance for 
both countries, stressing that mutual trust and cooperation is 
what a true relationship between neighbors should be. 
  "Within the framework of this cooperation," President Lilic 
said, "the Serbian minority in Hungary and the Hungarian 
minority in Yugoslavia should represent an important cohesive 
factor. As for the FRY, Hungarians living there enjoy all the 
rights of national minorities in accordance with the highest 
international standards, as well as full equality as citizens. 
I hope that the same criterion applies to the Serbian minority 
in Hungary," President Lilic said. 
  Speaking about the aim of his visit, Minister Jeszenszky 
underscored that Hungary is aware of the importance and 
complexity of the present situation in the FRY and that it 
wishes peace to be established in war-affected areas of former 
Yugoslavia as soon as possible and that our two countries should 
consolidate their mutual relations. This visit reassured me 
that the FRY firmly intends to help resolve the conflict in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in a peaceful way, Jeszenszky said, adding 
that he realizes Yugoslavia is doing everything in its power to 
fully achieve this aim. 
  Minister Jeszenszky spoke in particular about prospects of 
the unification of Europe saying that the FRY should be included 
in this framework. "As we already know," the Hungarian foreign 
minister said, "Hungarians live in several countries and Hungary 
will try to resolve the issue of the cultural and national 
identity of its minority, not by changing the borders but 
through European processes of unification." 
  "We are also in favor of a united Europe," President Lilic 
stressed, "but for a Europe where all peoples and countries are 
equal. The behavior of certain members of the European and 
international communities -- especially the introduction of the 
unprecedented and inhuman sanctions against our country -- shows 
that such an ideal has not yet been attained. The efforts made 
by the FRY are being ignored -- although certain changes have 
been detected recently and the truth is slowly becoming apparent 
-- despite the fact that, since the very outbreak of the crisis 
in former Yugoslavia and especially the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Yugoslavia always advocated a peaceful 
solution to all disputes and a negotiated settlement. Our 
consistent adherence to a policy of peace, as well as our 
constructive stand and significant contribution to the 
acceptance of all the conditions set by the European Union at 
the latest round of the Geneva talks, did not result in the 
lifting of sanctions. It became obvious after the latest round 
of negotiations just how absurd it is to punish Yugoslavia 
because one side in Bosnia-Herzegovina opted for war, 
unfortunately with support from certain world circles. 
Evidently, President Lilic concluded, somebody in the world 
cares more about the sanctions against the FRY than about peace 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Underlining that the sanctions against the FRY are 
inflicting 
severe damage to Yugoslavia and its neighbors, President Lilic 
said he hopes Hungary will significantly alter its stands on the 
sanctions and urge the international community more resolutely 
to lift them. 
  We all have to make an appraisal of the consequences of this 
unhappy period for our entire region, Geza Jeszenszky said, 
which should be forgotten -- like a bad dream. The Hungarian 
Government and people wish to see mutual relations and economic 
cooperation develop. In this respect, Minister Jeszenszky 
added, Hungary will work within the framework of the 
international community to improve conditions for the 
realization of all that is in our mutual interest. 
  The meeting was also attended by Yugoslav Foreign Minister 
Vladislav Jovanovic.

  [Text] Belgrade, 28 Jan (TANJUG) -- "I think that now is 
the right time in history not only to resolve the crisis (in the 
former Yugoslavia) but also to improve Yugoslav-Hungarian 
relations," Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said 
today, at the end of his two-day visit to the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia. 
  At a joint news conference with Yugoslav Foreign Minister 
Vladislav Jovanovic at the Palace of the Federation Jeszenszky 
pointed to the consequences of the unjust international 
sanctions both for Yugoslavia and for Hungary and said that the 
purpose of his visit was to "see what could be done when the 
sanctions are lifted," so that the two countries "can fully 
promote bilateral economic, cultural, and political relations." 
  Jeszenszky noted with satisfaction that the bilateral 
relations and relations between citizens had not deteriorated. 
He added that in the talks today with President Lilic and Prime 
Minister Kontic, as well as during the talks last night with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, which the president of the 
DZVM [Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians], Andras 
Agoston, also attended. He was informed that members of the 
Hungarian national minority in Serbia enjoyed all rights 
guaranteed by the Serbian constitution, in keeping with the 
highest standards envisaged by CSCE documents. 
  Recalling that he had talked at length today with Yugoslav 
Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic about the efforts the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was making toward a peaceful 
resolution of the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, about the 
opening of new border crossings, the importance of free traffic 
on the river Danube, cooperation in curbing international crime, 
and relations between the CSCE and Yugoslavia, Jeszenszky said 
that the two foreign ministers would meet again soon. 
  He added that he was leaving Yugoslavia convinced it was 
everyone's wish "that the difficult period (of sanctions) should 
end, the situation should return to normal and that, as regards 
Europe and European relations, our ties should assume a new 
quality."

  [Text] Jagodina, 29 Jan -- Vuk Draskovic, chairman of the 
Serbian Renewal Movement told Radio Jagodina today that during 
three-hour long talks last night between representatives of the 
parliamentary opposition parties and the Socialist Party of 
Serbia [SPS], Depos [Democratic Movement of Serbia] offered to 
support the formation of a minority Socialist government in 
exchange for the position of the [Serbian] Assembly speaker. 
  However, according to Draskovic, no agreement was reached 
because the Socialists "rejected a compromise". Depos, as the 
leading parliamentary opposition party offered the SPS a 
compromise to the effect that a deputy of the democratic 
opposition of Serbia be appointed Assembly speaker, and in 
return it would give up not only the post of prime minister, but 
also all government ministries. As a sign of good will we 
offered to have two deputy speakers in the Assembly presidency. 
To reject the readiness of the largest opposition party to 
support the formation of a minority Socialist government in the 
name of national unity, while in exchange it would obtain only 
the post of the first among the equal in the Serbian Assembly, 
is the proof of the Socialists' utmost intolerance," Draskovic 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by Srdjan Savic] </F>
  [Excerpt] The process of internal party discussions on 
policy concepts and personal issues ended at the extraordinary 
convention of the Democratic Party without the party 
experiencing a rift. This was stated by Zoran Djindjic, who 
replaced Dragoljub Micunovic as president of the Democratic 
Party last night, at his first news conference in this capacity. 
Srdjan Savic reports: 
  [Savic] Yesterday's discussion on various policy concepts 
was not a discussion on the party's program orientations, which 
means that the Democratic Party will continue the policy that 
existed before the election. This was stated by the new leader 
of the Democratic Party, Zoran Djindjic. He stressed that the 
former party president Dragoljub Micunovic would remain the head 
of the deputies' caucus in the federal parliament and that his 
full participation in the work of the party would be appreciated. 
  Speaking about the continuation of the talks on the 
inauguration of the republican assembly scheduled for tomorrow 
[31 January], Djindjic stressed that the opposition expects a 
gesture of goodwill from the ruling party. This means that the 
opposition expects the ruling party to allow Depos [Democratic 
Movement of Serbia] to appoint the chairman of the assembly. 
However, the Democratic Party will try its utmost to unblock 
the work of the Serbian Assembly even at the price of a 
non-opposition assembly chairman, because it wants to enable the 
parliament to perform its main, legislative function, Zoran 
Djindjic said. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Dragoljub Stankic] </F>
  [Text] The Third Fatherland Congress of the Serbian 
Radical Party [SRS] is currently being held in the Trade Unions 
Hall in Belgrade. The agenda includes the adoption of a new 
statute and the party's program, the report on the work of the 
party in the past period, and the election of the president and 
the Central Fatherland Administration. Party president Vojislav 
Seselj submitted a report on the work of the party. Dragoljub 
Stankic reports: 
  [Stankic] The 672 delegates and 358 guests of the SRS from 
the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro, the republic 
of Srpska, and the republic of Serbian Krajina tumultuously 
greeted the arrival of Vojislav Seselj, president of the Serbian 
Radicals. He submitted a report on the work of the party at the 
very beginning of the congress. 
  Seselj spoke about the period starting with 1989, the 
revival 
of the Serbian national conscience, and the founding of the 
party in 1990, which was at that time called, as Seselj said, 
the Serbian Liberation Movement. The party then changed its 
name into the Serbian Renewal Movement, the Serbian Chetnik 
Movement, and finally the Serbian Radical Party in 1991. 
  The civil war broke out. Many volunteers from the party went 
to defend the Serbian lands. About 70 percent of the Serbian 
ethnic regions have been defended in the republic of Serbian 
Krajina, and almost all Serbian villages in the republic of 
Srpska, Seselj stressed. Today, it is only possible to 
establish peace where the lines of the front are, Seselj said. 
His message to Radovan Karadzic was to declare the independence 
of the republic of Srpska and join the Republic of Serbia in a 
single state. This was greeted with applause. 
  In the 1992 elections, the party was successful, but decided 
to support the minority government of the Socialists. A year 
later, the party embarked on overthrowing the government. As 
Seselj said, the party decided to do this not because of the 
wish for power, but because of the poor results, mistakes in the 
economy, and the flourishing crime. 
  Seselj said he was satisfied with the election results in 
the 
republic of Serbian Krajina. He announced that the Radicals 
would form a coalition government with the Serbian Democratic 
Party of Krajina. 
  At the end of his speech Seselj said that his message to the 
Socialists of Serbia and Montenegro was that he will not allow 
the return of ideological premises, which he thought were 
superseded. His message for the Serbian Democratic Party in the 
republic of Srpska was that he will not abandon the joint front 
for the defense of the Serbian land. 
  His speech was followed by a discussion on the report. 
Nikola Poplasen, Rade Leskovac, Jovan Glamocanin, and many 
others have already spoken. The delegates are currently in a 
recess. When they return, they will, as expected, elect the 
president of the party by a secret ballot. There are seven 
candidates. The 50 members of the Central Fatherland 
Administration, a new political organ of the Serbian Radicals of 
all Serbian lands, will be elected by show of hand.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roman Kalisky: "Miklos Duray and Bela Bugar </F>
Keep Writing...."] 
  [Text] The TA SR has published as a document a letter from 
the Coexistence Movement and the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement [MKDH] to the Council of Europe [CE], dated 19 January 
1994, signed by the gentlemen named in the headline. The letter 
consists of five points, and its authors address the letter's 
addressees as "Esteemed Mr., Esteemed Mrs.," from which it is 
easy to infer that each gentleman and each lady of this 
respected institution will find his own copy on his or her desk. 
If only our respected Ministry of Foreign Affairs acted as 
promptly! 
  "Representatives of the Slovak Republic (who is meant by 
that?--R.K.) and the Slovak Parliament pledged to develop and 
implement their policy vis-a-vis minorities in accordance with 
CE Recommendation Number 1,201," the signatories of the letter 
state, and deplore that this has not happened. 
  Messrs. Duray and Bugar announce with "deep regret" that in 
December 1993 the Slovak Parliament "approved Resolution Number 
309, thereby abolishing its Resolution Number 225 of June 1993, 
in which it pledged to proceed in its policy toward the 
minorities from the principles of CE Recommendation Number 
1,201." 
  Thanks be to God that this happened because, as each citizen 
of the Slovak Republic who is at least a bit conversant with the 
matter knows, the notorious Recommendation Number 1,201 was only 
a working draft that has meanwhile been "withdrawn from 
circulation." 
  The letter from Coexistence and the MKDH rejects the 
National 
Council of the Slovak Republic law on the use of Christian names 
and surnames, which supposedly "orders the declension of female 
surnames according to the Slovak grammar," protests against the 
division of the "compact Hungarian community in southern 
Slovakia" according to the territorial and administrative setup 
now under preparation, demands that "Hungarian towns be given 
their historical names" (that is, names Magyarized by force in 
the years of the most brutal oppression of Slovaks--R.K.), and 
protests against the possibility of "alternative education" at 
schools with Hungarian as the language of instruction "at the 
order of a few parents" (!). On the other hand, the letter 
observes that "90 percent of Hungarians speak fluent Slovak," 
which raises the question why and through whose endeavor we come 
across the words "nem irtem," [Hungarian for "I do not 
understand"), spoken with a smile on the face, daily in shops 
and other institutions in southern Slovakia. 
  The authors of the letter refer to the Komarno protest of 8 
January 1994, which, along with the five points raised, 
supposedly testifies to the unacceptability of Slovak Government 
policy "for the minorities (Messrs. Duray and Bugar suddenly 
speak in the name of all minorities?--R.K.), which consider this 
to be a restriction of their right to self-determination." 
  This single sentence reveals it all! The right to 
self-determination, which is a collective right, belongs to 
nations and not to ethnic minorities--that is, not even to the 
one, about which the writers of the letter to the CE are 
concerned. They, too, know this very well. Still, they keep 
writing.... Let them write. It seems that Europe, including 
its Council, has at long last begun to see who seeks coexistence 
and who is after confrontation and destabilization in Central 
Europe.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ivan Horsky: "Wake After Teasing?; </F>
Hungarian-Slovak Dialogue Diverted Into a Blind Alley"] 
  [Text] Slovak-Hungarian relations have in recent days and 
weeks become the center of a media war, particularly with regard 
to the solution of minority issues. People with weaker nerves 
may have even perceived this as an exchange of fire. The live 
ammunition was supplied by both sides, which have been 
exploiting the insufficient solution of this undeniably 
controversial problem for political manipulation in their own 
favor. 
  This is the main reason why, in both Hungary and Slovakia, 
executive as well as legislative bodies deliberately do not 
bring the whole matter to the required end. Naturally, this 
then creates scope for artificial escalation of tension, the 
whipping up of emotions, and fishing in muddy waters, the result 
of which is the almost absolute absence of trust on both sides, 
but also between the state and the minorities living on its 
territory. 
  As far as Budapest is concerned, the present Hungarian 
Democratic Forum-led government coalition can scarcely be 
expected to change its course less than four months before the 
elections. The overt support that it provides to the political 
representatives of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia, while at 
the same time vehemently rejecting even the slightest hint that 
the positions of the two sides are being coordinated, testifies 
to the opposite. 
  There would be nothing wrong with this if the positions of 
the two largest parties representing the Hungarian minority were 
clear and transparent. Their eternal shifts, the hardening and 
then again softening of their positions, depending evidently on 
the response they are getting from abroad, make it impossible 
for their negotiating partners to assume an unequivocal stand. 
It must be said, however, for the sake of objectivity, that 
this negotiating partner [the Slovak Government] has at present 
no intention of holding talks because this allows him to arouse 
in society fears of a potential external threat to the integrity 
of the state and to declare himself the sole guarantor that the 
state will be saved--not to mention the fact that this attitude 
allows him to use the argument, also vis-a-vis the world, that 
it is because of this threat that Slovakia cannot meet all the 
commitments it has adopted or the deadline for their fulfillment. 
  Both sides use the minority issue as a hostage of their 
policies or politicking. They assume the posture of someone who 
has been wronged, a posture, however, that is meant only for a 
part of the gullible domestic audience. The world somehow does 
not swallow this bait. At the same time, it is evident that 
both Bratislava and Budapest are in for the same measure of 
criticism. Only we are trying to persuade ourselves that we are 
being wronged by everyone. If this actually happens, it is only 
because we are shooting ourselves in the foot. 
  It can be assumed that the two sides will hold on to their 
present policies at least until May, or until the formation of a 
new Hungarian government. Although such tests of the other 
side's nerves are not uncommon in politics, they do have their 
risks, which are not exactly small. A small incident, even a 
staged one, may be enough to set off a widespread conflagration. 
Fortunately, nothing of the sort has happened yet. Ordinary 
people apparently have more common sense than their governments. 
  I only hope that talks will not start only after the first 
electric transmission lines are blown up or after state symbols 
are attacked in some other way, as was the case, for example, in 
South Tyrol in the 1960's. The time factor, too, must be taken 
into consideration. Italy's nonobservance of the Paris Treaty 
demonstrated that delaying a solution may be a useless display 
of stubbornness. Ultimately, internal and external pressures 
led to dialogue and to the search for solutions acceptable to 
all interested parties, after all. At the same time, the case 
of South Tyrol cannot be considered a model that lends itself to 
automatic adoption. 
  No such model exists. What one can do, however, is learn a 
lesson about what not to do and what to do and how. Using the 
good services offered by the South Tyroleans would do no harm, 
either, to prevent teasing from being followed by wake [pun 
based on the similarity between the words "prekaracky" (teasing) 
and "karacky" (wake held for a dead person)] and, on top of 
that, exchanges of fire or acts of terrorism.

<F P=106> [Article by "(dos)": "Weiss: The Party of the Democratic </F>
Left Is Next, After the Slovak National Party,"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--I know that the Party of the Democratic 
Left [SDL] is next, after the Slovak National Party [SNS], but 
the methods that were used to break up the SNS will not be 
successful with the SDL. This statement was made yesterday by 
SDL Chairman Peter Weiss. He described the claim made by Deputy 
Prime Minister S. Kozlik that P. Weiss and L. Pittner voted 
intentionally for the draft state budget as a deliberate 
political lie. "I know that the prime minister waited 
impatiently for the outcome of the SDL Executive Committee 
meeting and that he expected me to resign," said Weiss in this 
context. According to him, differences are beginning to crop up 
within the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] between 
those who want to continue democratically to fulfill the HZDS' 
preelection program and those who, despite their deputy's 
mandate, also have posts in the state administration and are 
interested in privatization. Weiss considers the visit to 
Slovakia by representatives from the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF] to be part of the preelection campaign organized by the 
party, which is trying to ward off the threat of electoral 
defeat. Weiss announced that L. Fogas (SDL), the leader of the 
group of National Council of the Slovak Republic deputies in the 
Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, has been elected one 
of its deputy chairmen.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The leading representatives of the 
Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] gave a news conference in 
Bratislava today. After the news conference, Zuzana Stukovska 
asked KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky for an interview. 
  [Begin recording] [Stukovska] Your colleagues said at a news 
conference today that cooperation between the castle [the 
president] and the government is not functioning. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Carnogursky] As to President Kovac's visit to Poland, it is 
obvious that the government did not cooperate with the president 
as it should have. I think that Prime Minister Meciar's 
statement yesterday [26 January] that he had learned about the 
visit too late is not an excuse. The visit was agreed during 
the Visegrad summit in Prague. Economics Minister Ducky was 
present at the talks between President Kovac and President 
Walesa and therefore it was his duty to inform Prime Minister 
Meciar. Meciar cannot use the excuse that some of his ministers 
knew something but did not tell him. He is responsible for the 
whole government. 
  The visit must have been organized with the help of the 
Slovak Embassy in Warsaw, which is under the control of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs--part of the government. If, in 
spite of this information and the preparation, the government 
failed to prepare documents on the agreements that were expected 
by the Polish side, this casts doubt on Prime Minister Meciar's 
claim that Prime Minister Pawlak did not want any meeting 
between ministers this month. The agreements ought to have been 
ready, and, when the presidential office voiced the wish that 
Minister Ducky should accompany the president, I think it was 
the duty of the government to organize his participation. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Stukovska] If tension accumulates, there is danger of an 
explosion. What can be done? This is a question for you as a 
parliamentary deputy. 
  [Carnogursky] This latest affair with the president's visit 
to Poland is an obvious failure of the government; therefore, 
the deputies of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia should 
draw its' own conclusions. Sooner or later, the issue of a vote 
of no confidence in the government will come to the fore. 
  [Stukovska] Do you think that this could happen during the 
current session of parliament? 
  [Carnogursky] It is not likely. 
  [Stukovska] [passage omitted] What are the chances, in your 
opinion, that the bill on large-scale privatization, which has 
been discussed and criticized so much, will be passed? 
  [Carnogursky]] [passage omitted] The Slovak papers have been 
saying for a few days that, if the government bill on 
large-scale privatization is passed, this will mean that 
political and economic power will be concentrated in the hands 
of the government--that is to say, in the hands of one man, 
Prime Minister Meciar. Commentaries in these papers, which are 
not in the hands of the KDH, do not welcome the adoption of this 
law. We agree with them. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Bratislava--"By 2 May 1994, the Slovak 
Government will submit to the International Court of Justice in 
The Hague the `Memorandum of the Slovak Republic on the 
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Hydroelectric Power Project.' We expect the 
document to consist of 2,000-2,500 pages," Jan Lisuch, state 
secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told yesterday's 
meeting of the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] 
Commission for Issues of the Danube Hydroelectric Projects. 
  The state secretary also briefed the NRSR commission on 
findings acquired thus far about the impact of the Gabcikovo 
hydroelectric project on the level of underground water in Zitny 
Ostrov [Rye Island, area along the Danube in southern Slovakia], 
on water supply in the system of Danube branches, and on 
improving navigation on the Danube. [passage omitted] 
  At their meeting yesterday, members of the NRSR commission 
also discussed a reply to a letter from Andras Pap, chairman of 
the Hungarian Parliament's committee dealing with the 
hydroelectric project. The reply states that the solution to 
the problem of a sufficient amount of water in the Danube 
branches [on Hungarian territory] lies in the "mutually agreed 
construction of a dam at Dunakiliti. This would make it 
possible to supply the network of branches in the Szigetkoz area 
with up to 140 cubic meters of water per second." Academician 
Juraj Hrasko, chairman of the NRSR commission, stressed that the 
flow in the old river bed [of the Danube] could be increased 
after the completion of an automatic water diversion system at a 
newly built small hydroelectric power plant [at Dunakiliti]. 
This pledge [to increase flow in the old riverbed] would mean a 
reduction in the production of electricity in Gabcikovo by about 
28 million kilowatt-hours annually, which would extend the 
period necessary for the investment costs to be recouped. "On no 
account will the Slovak side consider this temporary solution to 
be a retreat from positions during the discussion of the 
Slovak-Hungarian dispute before the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague. The failure to implement solutions, the 
blueprints of which are ready and agreement on which had already 
been reached, runs counter to our common interest in the 
creation of optimal conditions for the ecological system of 
Danube wetland forests," the reply from the NRSR commission to 
Andras Pap's letter states.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Tanks Dominate Military Technology </F>
Exports Despite Their Being Expensive and Outdated"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--In 1993, the only successful arms 
exports were from the production of ZTS [Heavy Machinery Works] 
TEES [expansion unknown] Martin, Milan Warecha, director of the 
firm Unimpex, which exports arms from Slovakia, said yesterday. 
Unimpex was founded by the Martimex company in 1990. As early 
as in 1993, Unimpex turnover reached 4.05 billion korunas [Sk]. 
Exports of T-72 tanks from the ZTS Martin production provided 
99 percent of the total turnover. The value of last year's 
exports is Sk3.3 billion. Warecha said that the territories to 
which the arms are exported have changed substantially. He 
emphasized, however, that the license committee has granted 
licenses for all sales realized. In comparison with 1992, when 
exports to Russia reached Sk400 million, the volume declined 
last year to Sk200 million. 
  Slovak exports of military technology face numerous problems 
on the world market. According to Warecha, Russia, which 
produces as many as 10,000 tanks annually, is great competition, 
as their prices hover around $500,000, while the Slovak tanks 
cost as much as $1 million, and the Slovak engineering 
facilities can produce only 250-300 tanks. Another handicap for 
the Slovak arms industry is its gradual antiquation. A total 
modernization would require tremendous financial means. The 
debts from the time of the federation still also work against 
the Slovak enterprises. On the other hand, the quality of the 
exported goods favors Slovak exports. Customers often prefer 
Slovak military hardware to Russian or Polish arms. The 
foundation of a new company with state participation mentioned 
by Prime Minister Meciar should serve, according to Warecha, the 
coordination of Slovak exports. Numerous contracts are signed 
at governmental level, and it will depend on the state how it 
will fend for the new company, he added.

<F P=106> ["ip"-attributed report: "Moderate Growth of Prices; </F>
Lasting Decline of Production"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava -- The price growth slowed in the 
last three months of 1993, Rudolf Krc, chairman of the Slovak 
Statistical Office, told a news conference yesterday. Whereas 
in October prices rose 1.4 percent [compared with the preceding 
month], in November they rose 1 percent, and in December 0.6 
percent. [passage omitted] 
  Goods worth 314.4 billion korunas [Sk] were produced in 
industry in the first 11 months of the year, 13.9 percent less 
than in the same period the year before. The volume of building 
work reached the value of Sk39 billion, which was 23.4 percent 
less than in the first 11 months of 1992. 
  The Slovak Statistical Office has also released some data 
for 
December 1993. In livestock production, the numbers of cattle, 
pigs, and poultry continued to decline. Milk production reached 
1.2144 billion liters, 8.7 less than in December 1992, while the 
production of eggs declined more than 11 percent. 
  Average industrial monthly wages in enterprises with 25 and 
more employees reached Sk6,942 in November, which was Sk1,034 
(17.5 percent) more than in the same month the year before. 
Average monthly wages in construction stood at Sk6,573, in 
transportation at Sk6,206, and in retailing at Sk5,126. A 
month-to-month comparison shows a slight increase in the 
productivity of labor. A total of 368,095 job applicants were 
registered with labor offices at the end of the year. The 
number of unemployed increased 0.4 percent in the course of 
December (to 14.4 percent). An annual comparison shows an 
increase in employment by 4 percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski by </F>
correspondent Andrzej Urbanski, "assisted" by Malgorzata 
Bochenek and Anna Machcewicz; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Urbanski] Minister, what was the formal 
legislative situation concerning Poland's security, which you 
found on assuming office? 
  [Olechowski] Poland has signed friendship and good-neighbor 
relations treaties with all its neighbors except Lithuania. 
Therefore, if real life were seen in terms of treaty-signing, we 
would have good guarantees of continued national security. 
  [Urbanski] So can we feel secure? 
  [Olechowski] We believe, to quote a priceless formula used 
once by the president, that it is not guarantees that are a fact 
but that hard facts constitute guarantees. At present, 
cooperation within the framework of a broader community remains 
the only form of ensuring that we have both national security 
and development. Polish people would like to be members of a 
community of Western states--hence our endeavors to be accepted 
into organizations that bind West European states together: the 
European Union [EU] and NATO. We will be associated with the EU 
as soon as February of this year. 
  That association will give us a definitive status; also, on 
the one hand, it sets the timetable for our entry into other 
European institutions, and, on the other, it creates premises 
for the belief that we will in the future become members of the 
EU. However, it must be stated that we still have no detailed 
timetable for the stages of our entry into Union membership. 
  As regards NATO, following the Brussels summit we know that 
it is not a closed organization. One of the criteria of 
acceptance of new members will be the latters' active 
participation in the Partnership for Peace program, but it will 
not be the only criterion with which we will have to comply. 
Unfortunately, no definitive conditions which will determine 
our membership have been set as yet, although we had asked for 
them to be set. 
  To recapitulate, we are already, as it were, in the 
vestibule 
of the EU, whereas as regards NATO, the door leading to the 
vestibule has already been opened. 
  [Urbanski] The process of our rapprochement with West 
European organizations began in 1989 with the great "fall of the 
peoples," but its first formal effects are beginning to appear 
only today. 
  [Olechowski] We Poles are naturally impatient. In addition, 
we have a "demanding" attitude to the world, which stems from 
our sense of having been instrumental in spreading peace in 
Europe; it is enough to mention Solidarity, Lech Walesa, and so 
on. 
  Nevertheless, we must remember that we want to join an 
existing community which has forged a mutually satisfying 
coexistence as a result of a series of difficult compromises. 
In addition, we must remember the problem of the actual 
organizational and decision-related capabilities: It is not 
without significance whether there are a dozen or twenty 
countries in any given community. 
  Finally, the people of the countries belonging to the 
European Community must first approve our accession to the 
Community: They must become accustomed to the idea of 
cooperation with us and the possibility of the need to defend 
our borders. When we view all these things in the light of the 
need for mutual integration, four years do not appear to be too 
long at all. It took much longer for Spain to be accepted into 
NATO and the EEC. 
  [Urbanski] How should we demonstrate our active 
involvement in Partnership for Peace? 
  [Olechowski] The role played by a partner state is fairly 
well defined in that program. A partner is a state which has 
adopted NATO's values and principles concerning the behavior of 
a member in matters of military and foreign policies and which 
is ready to take an active part in all operations designed to 
uphold or restore peace and in emergency rescue actions in 
Europe. Participation in such operations will require the 
assignment, training, and equipment of military units so that 
they are compatible with NATO requirements. At the same time, 
that will constitute a test designed to show whether the given 
country is capable--in military terms--of NATO membership. 
  The carrying out of such adjustment operations will require 
financial outlays. Some countries, including Poland, will 
strive for integration with NATO. On the other hand, those 
countries which decide to choose a different model of political 
development or else decide not to cooperate militarily with 
NATO, can still be passive members of Partnership for Peace or 
they can opt for taking no part in the program. 
  [Urbanski] How much truth is there in the assertion that it 
was pressure exerted by Poland that was responsible for 
Partnership for Peace assuming its final shape? 
  [Olechowski] We do not know that for sure because some of 
the talks were held behind closed doors. We are convinced that 
other participants beside us spoke about those points in which 
the final version of Partnership for Peace differs from the 
original draft. Nevertheless, it was certainly we who raised the 
level of the public debate as high as it was as we articulated 
clearly what we were striving for. 
  Those negotiations, in any case, should have been held out 
in 
the open, because they touch on issues that are of principal 
importance for the state. Therefore it would be most important 
for politicians to get to know the public's opinions and 
reactions. 
  Of course, such a manner of conducting negotiations involves 
its own price. It is a method similar to the manner of our 
negotiations concerning debt reduction, which we also held out 
in the open. The point of departure for those was a targeted 
80-percent reduction; in the end, we obtained 50 percent, and 
that was a great success. Even so, some people still considered 
it a failure. This time also a part of the population might 
regard the outcome of our negotiations over Partnership for 
Peace as a failure. 
  We consider the absence of a precise timetable of events 
designed to bring us closer to NATO a highly disappointing and 
frustrating circumstance. However, we should view it from a 
more general perspective of transformations in the global 
politics and from the viewpoint of the other side, which has no 
precisely defined vision. That is why it is difficult for us to 
obtain such concrete details. 
  [Urbanski] What allies do we have in our attempts to secure 
these details? 
  [Olechowski] All the countries of the Visegrad group which 
have identical chances of entering NATO. The Baltic states, on 
the other hand, are less well prepared for such a move, and for 
them the absence of such a prospect is at present a more 
advantageous solution. 
  We have allies in Germany, and I also sense that there is a 
compatibility with our interests on the part of the United 
States. We have heard a most categorical assurance that the 
security of the United States as well as European NATO members 
depends directly on our own security. Anyone who views the 
issue of security in global terms will also think about Poland's 
security, whereas those who think of it as a regional concern 
will tend to forget about us. 
  [Urbanski] In recent weeks we witnessed a diplomatic 
offensive on the part of our biggest Eastern neighbor, who 
opposed the idea of a speedy expansion of NATO membership. 
Should we fear Russia? 
  [Olechowski] We need not fear Russia in the immediate 
future, because it has no designs on us. On the other hand, we 
should be afraid of the failure and collapse of democracy in 
Russia. Fortunately, the results of the recent election show 
that the enemies of democracy there are in the minority--albeit 
a vocal minority. A democratic, strong, and prosperous Russia 
would be an ideal dream neighbor for us. 
  [Urbanski] In addition to strong criticism of our concept of 
European security, statements made by Russian politicians 
nowadays contain two additional, highly menacing elements: an 
attempt to invoke the right of veto against NATO's decisions, 
and assertions that Poland still lies within the Russian sphere 
of influence. 
  [Olechowski] These signals suggest that many people in 
Russia still think in terms of the historical past. However, 
there is a certain attenuating circumstance. Russia is simply 
too big ever to become a rank-and-file element of any system. 
If I were the Russian foreign minister, I would also set out to 
oppose any final decisions concerning a new security system 
until a definitive vision of Russia's place and role in the 
world is formulated--a vision that will successfully match both 
Russia's power and its needs. 
  On the other hand, we are deeply concerned about the fact 
that Russian politicians have been trying to dictate their 
neighbors' moves and behavior. That is inadmissible. 
  [Urbanski] A new opinion was recently voiced in the American 
press: that Partnership for Peace also represents a chance for 
Ukraine.... 
  [Olechowski] The inclusion of Ukraine in the program is a 
most important question from our viewpoint. I would not even 
imagine a situation in which Partnership for Peace could embrace 
only East European countries. In such an event the "frontier 
line" would be moved to our Eastern border, and that is not at 
all in our interest. We would than become a "frontier state." 
  [Urbanski] Have our political forces in Poland reached a 
consensus on the question of how to ensure security for our 
state? 
  [Olechowski] It is enough to scan the news announcements 
carried by newspapers of all political orientations. It seems 
to me that there is total agreement as to the principal 
direction of our foreign policy. Many prominent and influential 
politicians representing individual groups support our current 
line in foreign policy. It is true that in that respect I am a 
particularly lucky minister. 
  [Urbanski] Over the past months I noted several opinions by 
our politicians at home in which they set out proposals for 
foreign regional cooperation--for example, linking Bonn with 
Warsaw and Moscow. What do you think of such proposals? 
  [Olechowski] We could carry out a brief analysis of these 
alternative concepts. One of them claims that we should declare 
neutrality. However, we would be too weak on our own to be able 
to repulse a possible threat to our security. Nor could we 
really consider disarmament, either, because all too quickly 
someone would take a lively interest in claiming our piece of 
"unguarded property." It would only be possible to set up 
regional cooperation with our neighbors in the south; however, 
these countries are militarily just as weak. Again, it would 
not be feasible to to set up regional cooperation based on one 
of our Western neighbors--for example, Germany--because in order 
to do that we would have had to make an earlier active effort to 
break up NATO, and that would be an act of patent insanity. 
Such an action would be to the detriment of European as well as 
world interests, and it would directly contravene the idea of 
integration. 
  Consequently, what remains is the Eastern option, that is, 
building a community of states around Russia. However, as 
things are today, we would have to beg Russia on our knees to 
consider such an idea, because we are not a serious partner for 
it either in terms of political or economic interest. As far as 
Russia is concerned, a serious economic partner would be one 
that could offer it financial credits; in a certain sense, then, 
such a position could be bought. Therefore, if we were to 
secure enough money to finance such a scheme, we could 
strengthen our position quite considerably. An additional 
argument against that option is that Russia is not as yet a 
democratic state. 
  Each of the above solutions would be unattractive from the 
perspective of our civilizational development. Poles have 
always shown a marked leaning toward the West: our culture, our 
civilization, and our religion all have their roots there. 
  [Urbanski] Do you agree with the thesis that Poland has 
chosen the Westward path also in order to bring its economic 
relations with Russia to a higher level? 
  [Olechowski] I do. I believe that we should act as a 
coorganizer of economic cooperation between Europe and Russia. 
If Poland approaches the Western level of economic development 
while Russia, Ukraine, and other countries to the east of our 
borders remain at the stage of having no market economy owing to 
the lack of support from the outside and the world's reluctance 
to make room for them in the global markets, then the increasing 
difference in our potentials could create great tensions that 
might eventually threaten an explosion. 
  Polish economic interests oblige us to take an active part 
in the process of building a democratic and wealthy Russia. The 
eastern markets are a natural opening for us. Many Polish 
cities grew and developed through trading with Russia. We 
should strive even today to ensure that Polish suppliers have 
the optimum chances of reaching Russian markets, so that in the 
future we can set up well-functioning channels of economic 
cooperation. 
  [Urbanski] Where can we find the funds to finance such a 
scheme? 
  [Olechowski] All programs stipulating development of 
commercial exchange with Russia should receive favorable bank 
loans. We have been pressing for this for a number of years, 
but somehow the finance minister's hand would always tremble 
before he made the decision to sign such an agreement. However, 
I will keep insisting that it is a mistake not do do that. We 
should protect ourselves against the possibility of dropping out 
of the Russian market, and we must act with a view to 
establishing the best possible contacts there. 
  [Urbanski] Do you expect that the government will reach a 
consensus in this matter? 
  [Olechowski] We must explain the ins and outs of the whole 
issue carefully in order to preclude the possibility of 
misconceptions. For the time being we are preparing ourselves 
calmly and carefully to present the integrated picture of the 
premises of our policy as regards our Eastern neighbors. We 
want to breathe a new spirit into our relations with them, but 
for the time being we must wait until the present state of 
tension eases a little. There is no doubt that my recent 
statements did not quite match the declarations made by Mr. 
Kozyrev and other Russian politicians. 
  [Urbanski] What dreams do you cherish as foreign minister? 
  [Olechowski] I hope that during 1994 or 1995 we will see a 
clearly mapped-out route to NATO. However, I would not like to 
see Poland become a NATO member as a result of an emergency 
because of a destabilization of the situation in Russia. It is 
a dream of mine that by the year 2000 we are, alongside Russia, 
democratic partners within NATO. [Interview ends]

  The interview with Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski that 
is published above will serve as point of departure for the 
first program of a new television series to be broadcast on 
Polish Television's Second Channel, entitled "Questions About 
Poland." Other popular political and economic figures will 
appear in the program alongside Andrzej Olechowski. The program 
will be broadcast 22 January at 2010 [local time] on Channel Two. 
  In two weeks' time "Questions About Poland" will carry an 
interview given to Polish Television's Channel Two by Sejm 
Speaker Jozef Oleksy.

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski has 
returned from the United States, where he held talks with 
representatives of the U.S. Government on the Partnership for 
Peace program, among other things. According to the minister, 
the results of the talks will bring Poland closer to 
participation in the implementation of the program. 
  [Begin Olechowski recording] The primary objective of the 
Partnership for Peace concept is to create a Europe without 
borders and dividing lines. If, however, dividing lines were to 
exist, it is understood--and this view is shared--that Poland 
would find itself on the NATO side of the divide. Because the 
United States firmly emphasizes that its security depends on our 
security, it is in the interest of both sides, Poland and the 
United States--and NATO--that Poland should become an active 
partner in the Partnership for Peace. [end recording]

  [Text] Warsaw, 29 Jan--Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, 
speaking at a news conference held today after a meeting of the 
founding group of the Countryside Development Forum [Forum na 
Rzecz Polskiej Wsi], said he had met earlier today with the 
dismissed deputy finance minister, Stefan Kawalec, to whom he 
handed his dismissal notice. 
  "The meeting was held in a very calm atmosphere; we talked 
about the reasons for his dismissal," the prime minister added. 
The prime minister did not give specific reasons, but he said 
that the privatization of the Silesian Bank was not the direct 
reason for Kawalec's sacking. 
  Pawlak explained that during a conversation with him on 
Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Marek 
Borowski reiterated that he expected a reply in writing to his 
questions concerning the reason for Kawalec's dismissal. The 
prime minister pointed out that the letter had not yet reached 
Borowski, and for that reason he did not want to reveal any 
details contained in the letter. 
  When asked if Kawalec's sacking could weaken the Polish 
Peasant Party-Democratic Left Alliance coalition, and if there 
already was a candidate for the vacant post to replace the 
recalled minister, Pawlak explained that there is not yet an 
agreement concerning the candidate. With regard to the 
coalition, the prime minister said he does not think that 
Kawalec's dismissal could cause any problems.

  [Text] Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak has presented Stefan 
Kawalec the document dismissing him from the post of deputy 
minister of finance. The reason, according to the prime 
minister, was the work of the deputy minister in its entirety, 
and in particular the methods of privatization of the banks and 
reform of the insurance system. These clarifications did not 
satisfy Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and minister of 
finance, who did not grant his consent to the dismissal of his 
deputy minister. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The government press office 
reported the dismissal of Stefan Kawalec yesterday. Marek 
Borowski, the direct superior of the deputy minister, expressed 
surprise and requested a clarification of the reasons for this 
decision. This morning, Waldemar Pawlak invited deputy minister 
Kawalec for a meeting. 
  [Begin recording] [Kawalec] The prime minister handed me my 
dismissal. He informed me that Minister Borowski had not 
consented to this dismissal, which is why the prime minister 
took the decision independently. The prime minister told me 
that the cause is an evaluation of my work in the Ministry of 
Finance, inter alia the concepts for privatization of banks and 
insurance societies. 
  [Correspondent] Did this reply satisfy you? 
  [Borowski] No, of course it does not satisfy me, since no 
analysis of the work of Deputy Minister Kawalec was actually 
carried out. For matters to be clear, I here neither defend him 
nor attack him. I myself addressed the Supreme Chamber of 
Control with a request for an inspection. I feel that it was 
not appropriate to make such a decision before the results of an 
inspection. 
  [Correspondent] Marek Borowski requested the prime minister 
to give a wider justification for this decision in writing by 
Tuesday. Waldemar Pawlak said that the document is already ready. 
  [Pawlak] I quite simply do not wish to reveal the details 
before it is received by Deputy Prime Minister Borowski. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] In the prime minister's view, the dismissal of 
Deputy Minister Kawalec will not be the cause of any sort of 
troubles within the government coalition. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Have you in this situation 
considered the possibility of resigning, and if so in what 
circumstances? 
  [Borowski] Well, unfortunately, this question I must leave 
without comment, and without reply at this moment. 
  [Correspondent] But is it appropriate to expect such a 
reply, and if so when? 
  [Borowski] As I said, I am waiting until Tuesday, for the 
prime minister's reply . 
  [Correspondent] Stefan Kawalec, dismissed today, had held 
his 
post for four years. He was one of the closest colleagues of 
Leszek Balcerowicz. Among other things, he undertook the 
negotiation of the reduction of our foreign debt and the 
introduction of the convertibility of the zloty. He was also 
responsible for the reform of the banking system. Most 
recently, he supervised the privatization of the Bank Slaski.

<F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Bozena Wawrzewska under the </F>
"Commentaries" rubric] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the government displayed some peculiar 
behavior which was watched by all of society. 
  The prime minister dismissed Deputy Finance Minister 
Kawalec, 
about which Mr. Kawalec learned from the radio. The superior of 
the dismissed minister--Marek Borowski, finance minister and 
deputy prime minister--whose motion would be needed to bring 
about a dismissal like this, addressed a question to the prime 
minister on the reasons behind the dismissal. In reply, PAP 
received a communique issued by the Government's Press Office to 
the effect that Deputy Finance Minister Kawalec's dismissal is 
not linked to the privatization of Bank Slaski, whereas the real 
reasons were not given either to the press or to Deputy Prime 
Minister Borowski. All the prime minister's press secretary had 
to say is that there he has no comment on the issue. 
  Politics require the courage to tell the truth directly, 
even 
when it is about decisions which were hard to make. The prime 
minister has asked the press to report honestly, but what he is 
doing now is condemning journalists for speculating and 
expressing views on what could be described as a weird style of 
governing, to put it mildly. 
  So, faced with deficiencies in the government's information 
policies and with a lack of explanations which the public 
expects, one is entitled to draw different kinds of conclusions 
on, for instance, possible frictions within the coalition, a 
battle between the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left 
Alliance, mutual disloyalties among different cabinet members 
who talk to one another through journalists, who--as they often 
stress--they distrust, or about facing coalition partners with 
accomplished facts, which is not the first time this has 
happened.

<F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Krzysztof Bien under the </F>
"Commentaries" rubric] 
  [Text] The dismissal of Deputy Finance Minister Stefan 
Kawalec, who was responsible within the Finance Ministry for 
ownership transformations in the banking and insurance sector, 
may be directly associated with the ill-fated evaluation of the 
assets of Bank Slaski. But all signs indicate that the move was 
only a pretext which the prime minister decided to use after a 
series of incompetent and demagogic statements by politicians 
who were not just attacking (out of ignorance or out of 
hostility) this specific case of privatization and the stock 
market, but who also tried at the same time to bring into 
question the legacy of the economic transformations of the last 
four years. There are signs that we have indeed the case of a 
pretext here: There was just one sentence contained in a 
communique issued by the Government's Press Office--namely that 
Kawalec's dismissal "is not directly linked with Bank Slaski's 
privatization." 
  It seems that a fundamental goal of dismissing Deputy 
Finance 
Minister Kawalec--which was accomplished behind the back of his 
direct supervisor, that is to say Marek Borowski, deputy prime 
minister and finance minister--was to weaken the Finance 
Ministry's leadership which--contrary to earlier 
predictions--proved resistant to political pressures aiming at 
basic revisions to the economic policy. A draft of a 
savings-oriented budget for this year prepared by a team headed 
by Deputy Prime Minister Borowski was not applauded, even by 
people outside the Democratic Left Alliance. Those who were most 
disappointed were Sejm deputies for the Polish Peasant Party 
[PSL], who had demanded significant increases in agricultural 
expenditures. But the Finance Ministry is not willing to 
compromise as far as their policies go, so faced with that, the 
PSL members in the coalition decided to use instruments of 
political pressure--Deputy Minister Kawalec has so far been the 
only victim of the scheme, but all signs indicate that the goal 
was to eliminate someone above him. 
  The dismissal of Deputy Minister Kawalec--who was one of the 
last remaining associates of Leszek Balcerowicz in government 
now--most probably will not cause a major crisis inside the 
governing coalition. But the manner in which it was 
accomplished--that is to say, ignoring tradition-based 
procedures--is proof of PSL's strong determination to 
disintegrate the framework of a modern market economy which has 
already been established, and that is happening in the name of 
selfish interests by just one social group. Disadvantageous 
changes which are happening in the economy--rising inflation, 
compensatory prices, and a slowdown in privatization, among 
others--are proof that the disintegration is already taking 
place. The process can now be speeded up.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] In a recent interview, Sejm Speaker 
Jozef Oleksy, a prominent member of the Democratic Left Alliance 
(SLD), stressed that his party and the coalition government 
would not sacrifice economic growth by defending wage-earners 
too zealously. Oleksy, in the 26 December Poznan weekly WPROST, 
denied that the new Sejm has "Santa Claus" tendencies, asserting 
that the Sejm deputies have a "strong sense of realism" and that 
the Polish Left realizes it must play "a different role" from 
what left-wing parties play "in countries with a stabilized 
market economy." He maintained that the Polish Left knows it 
must "work out, together with the world of capital, a mutual 
concept of action that will lead to economic growth." He argued 
that it is a mistake to assume links between political parties 
and particular interest groups, noting that "the Polish 
political scene is just beginning to be formed" and that the 
links between parties and interest groups "are not completely 
established." 
  Assessing the possibility of losing popular support, Oleksy 
acknowledged that the governing coalition of the SLD and the 
Polish Peasant Party (PSL) faces a dilemma in formulating its 
economic policies: It cannot count on the patience of the 
voters, who elected it primarily because of their "anger" over 
the policies of the former government. What makes the 
coalition's predicament particularly difficult, Oleksy said, is 
that the people, while voting for a change in policy, "are 
unable to state precisely what their expectations are." Without 
a clear signal from the voters, Oleksy averred, the SLD will 
have to strike a balance between its campaign promises and "the 
rigors of economic realism." He observed that the local 
elections in June would be a barometer of the government's 
popular support, with a "clear" loss indicating that "hope in 
the coalition government is ebbing" and a victory strengthening 
the government's position.

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Due to the unstoppable advance of the cholera 
epidemic in our country, the Health Ministry decreed a national 
emergency today. Contrary to a report by the deputy health 
director, Health Minister Lisandro Vasquez Sosa reported that 
this is the beginning of a new outbreak. Four people have died 
and 700 have been affected by the cholera bacteria since 24 
December. 
  [Begin Vasquez recording] Medical personnel are on alert at 
all health centers. [end recording] 
  Health officials declared the emergency after 700 cases of 
this mortal epidemic were reported, an epidemic that is again 
taking its toll. 
  [Begin Vasquez recording] Today we have a complete 
laboratory study, and this is why we say that the deaths were 
cholera-caused. Four people have died and 700 cases have been 
reported. [end recording] 
  All this occurred since 24 December when a new outbreak was 
registered. According to the minister, 95 percent of the cases 
were a result of food that was handled without taking the proper 
hygienic measures. 
  [Begin Vasquez recording] Food was sold in the streets, 
foods that were improperly prepared and cooked; in fact, there 
are places where food is sold that are not suited for the 
handling of food. [end recording] 
  The health minister said that all of his personnel have been 
deployed to tend to the increasing cases. He said that it is 
untrue that hospitals have no more beds. 
  [Begin Vasquez recording] The hospitals have the capacity to 
face the problem. [end recording] 
  The minister said that they foresee another outbreak during 
the year's end festivities, but this could be avoided if people 
follow the proper recommendations.

  [Text] Prosecutor General Romeo Melara Granillo said the 
lack of a radar system to detect illegal aircraft and the 
numerous clandestine landing strips left from the war have made 
El Salvador a "paradise stopover" for drug traffickers. 
  Melara Granillo added, however, that experience shows that 
continuous pursuit can lead to heavy blows against drug 
trafficking, such as those delivered by the Drug Interdiction 
Executive Unit [UEA] in 1993. The unit reported five major 
seizures totaling 2.3 billion colones worth of cocaine. 
  The official told LA PRENSA GRAFICA that "had we not 
intercepted the drugs, they would have harmed thousands of 
people, if not in our country, surely in those for which it was 
bound. This is not only a violation of human rights, but a 
violent attack against the victims who have fallen into the 
clutches of this world-wide plague." Melara Granillo believes 
drug trafficking is primarily an insidious activity in pursuit 
of absolutely selfish, evil purposes. He acknowledged that drug 
trafficking is highly profitable but said such economic benefits 
are immoral. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office is well aware of its 
position 
regarding drug trafficking. It is making painstaking efforts to 
fight this enemy with the law to see that those responsible are 
tried and punished with the full force of the law. 
  Melara Granillo has been prosecutor general for five and 
one-half months now, during which he has confirmed the seizure 
of 121.598 million colones worth of cocaine. The drugs were 
intercepted at El Pulido landing strip in Melara Canton, La 
Libertad Municipality. 
  He has also certified the seizure of a second shipment worth 
700 million colones at the San Jorge industrial complex on the 
road to San Antonio Abad in San Salvador. A third seizure took 
place 42 km off the coast of Puerto Acajutla, Sonsonate, and 
included a total of 300 million colones in drugs. 
  The prosecutor general pointed out that never before has 
there been such a relentless pursuit in El Salvado but added 
that there are many clandestine landing strips remaining from 
the war. There is no radar system to detect illegal aircraft. 
Melara said "this is a paradise stopover that the armies of 
drug traffickers have taken advantage of, because they have the 
technological and economical resources to operate in countries 
such as ours." 
  He indicated that despite all the institution's efforts, it 
still faces serious financial and personnel limitations when the 
ideal scenario would be for it to grow so as to face the 
challenges of 1994.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 31 Dec (ACAN-EFE) -- The Guatemalan 
Army denied today that Guatemalan military personnel have ties 
with the gunrunning activities from El Salvador, as has been 
reported by a leader of the former guerrilla Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front (FMLN). Major Edith Vargas, spokesman 
for the Information and Press Department of the Army (DIDE), 
asserted that the Guatemalan Armed Forces obtain their weapons 
"legally" and not clandestinely. 
  Eduardo Linares, former guerrilla and now a political leader 
of the FMLN, accused, in statements to the Guatemala City PRENSA 
LIBRE newspaper, the Guatemalan military institution of being 
primarily responsible for the gunrunning activities. According 
to Linares, on one occasion the FMLN had bought an arsenal from 
Guatemalan military personnel. However, Major Vargas asserted 
that the former guerrilla "is totally misinformed." 
  The Guatemalan Army has charged the FMLN of gunrunning for 
the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG). 
Furthermore, Deputy Government Minister Adolfo Reyes accused 
the FMLN of being involved in criminal activities in that 
Central American country and said "we have evidence" to this 
effect. Recently, Guatemalan Interior Minister Arnoldo Ortiz 
and Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez said they suspected 
former FMLN members were involved in the abductions that are 
occurring in Guatemala to collect ransoms.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 31 Dec (AFP) -- The UK Embassy in 
Guatemala today confirmed that the Belizean Government will 
assume responsibility for its own defense as of 1 January 1994, 
and announced that it had started the "immediate" withdrawal of 
the UK troops stationed in that country located in the Central 
American isthmus. 
  Lourdes Taylor, the UK Embassy's cultural attache, asserted 
that the process will be completed by September 1994. She 
added, however, that a small UK military detachment would remain 
in Belize to operate a jungle training installation. "This 
action (the troop withdrawal) reflects the UK Government's trust 
in the much-improved relations between Guatemala and Belize and 
the determination of the governments of both countries to 
resolve their bilateral differences peacefully," Taylor asserted. 
  The official's statements alluded to Guatemala's historic 
claims to Belizean territory. The tone of those claims eased 
after former Guatemalan President Jorge Serrano recognized 
Belizean independence in 1991. 
  AFP talked on the phone to the spokesperson of Prime 
Minister 
Manuel Esquivel in Belmopan, and he explained that the UK troop 
withdrawal will be a gradual process, which was planned over the 
past seven months. It will be "a change of style in UK 
assistance" to Belize, Carlos Perdomo, who is Esquivel's private 
secretary, asserted. The official added that after the 
approximately 1,800 soldiers leave Belizean territory, the UK 
will maintain 100 military advisers to operate a special 
training school and that a changing number of UK soldiers will 
come to be trained at that school. 
  Last week, Prime Minister Esquivel stated that the frequent 
raids by Guatemalan soldiers on Belizean territory could be "a 
bad sign" and indicative of a possible invasion. Guatemalan 
authorities denied this possibility. Perdomo disclosed that 
there is no "immediate" fear that the Guatemalan Army will take 
advantage of the UK troop withdrawal to take their demands by 
force. 
  The prime minister's statements, explained his secretary, 
were triggered by the fact that Guatemalan opposition sectors 
have insisted on disavowing all the actions taken by former 
President Serrano, including his agreements with Belize, and 
declared them as unconstitutional. "If an opposition government 
sets in, it is possible that it will act differently from 
Presidents Serrano and (current President) De Leon Carpio have 
acted. This was the reason for the prime minister's 
statements," he added. 
  Belize obtained its independence from the UK in 1981, but UK 
troops have remained on the territory as guarantors of its 
territorial integrity. Ten years later, when it recognized 
Belizean independence, Guatemala renounced a large part of its 
demands for the territory of the young nation. It, however, 
maintains its intentions to negotiate a passage to the Caribbean 
sea through the Belizean Province of Toledo. Guatemala already 
has access to the sea in the extreme southeastern part of its 
territory. Negotiations for the opening can only be initiated 
when the recognition of Belizean independence is ratified by a 
referendum in Guatemala.

<F P=106> [Report by Leonarda Andino] </F>
  [Text] With tears in his eyes, National Human Rights 
Ombudsman Leo Valladares yesterday presented his "Preliminary 
Report on Missing Persons in Honduras From 1980-93." The 
report, which is subtitled "The Facts Speak for Themselves," 
claims the Honduran state, the Armed Forces, and the Nicaraguan 
contras are responsible for the forced disappearance of people 
in the country. 
  The much awaited report contains a provisional list of 184 
disappearances. This figure is higher than the 143 forced 
disappearances registered in the files of the Committee of 
Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras (Cofadeh). 
  Although names of people directly involved in these horrible 
crimes were not revealed, the ombudsman pointed out the 
importance of the state's acknowledgment of the existence of 
forced disappearances. So far, the Armed Forces and other 
institutions have refused to grant access to their 1980-93 files. 
  Valladares said: "The ombudsman did not want to find what he 
did as he reviewed the sad pages of our recent history. We 
would have preferred to tell the country that there were no 
disappearances. We would have preferred to report that 
officials of state institutions were never involved in 
disappearances." 
  In a melancholy tone, he added: "We would have preferred to 
say that torture was never practiced in Honduras. Nevertheless, 
the reality we discovered was terrible. Regrettably, there were 
indeed disappearances, and, unfortunately, civilian and military 
authorities were responsible or remained silent." 
  This is an important moment in my life, Valladares said, 
after presenting the historic document that had been handed over 
on the evening of 28 December to President Rafael Leonardo 
Callejas and on the morning of 29 December to President-elect 
Carlos Roberto Reina. 
  The most revealing part of the document contains the 
ombudsman's recommendations. The report states that in the 
country there were disappearances because there were people 
willing to carry them out. It demands that justice officials 
start an investigation to clarify the specific responsibility of 
all those mentioned in the report as masterminds and 
perpetrators of the disappearances. 
  Based on this, commanders or officers in charge of staff 
intelligence units, known as the G-2, must be investigated. 
Special attention must be given to those units in charge of 
fighting subversion between 1980 and the present. The 
commanders and officers of Intelligence Battalion 3-16 also must 
be investigated. Others who must be investigated include the 
directors of the National Investigations Directorate (DNI), 
formerly known as Department of National Investigation (DIN). 
Officers and people in charge of interrogation operations, such 
as the Special Operations Team of Intelligence Battalion 3-16 
and the so-called Special Investigations Detachment of the 
Public Security Force (Fusep), must also be investigated. 
  As for Armed Forces Commander Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, who 
was not in the country on 29 December and is accused by popular 
organizations of having been the head of the fearsome Battalion 
3-16 during the time of the disappearances, the ombudsman 
pointed out that Discua, as a soldier, is obliged to publicly 
explain his actions before the Honduran people. 
  Valladares said: "The facts speak for themselves. 
Nevertheless, even though Colonel Discua Elvir was chief of 
Battalion 3-16 and Mayor Juan Blas Salazar was DNI chief, we 
should not presume they are responsible, because we are not 
judges. The ombudsman conducted an investigation that he has 
presented to the authorities, and they are the ones who should 
implement the proper measures." 
  The ombudsman said he will place the report in the hands of 
the state prosecutor, adding that the Public Prosecutor's Office 
will be urged to act within a year of receiving the document. 
  Valladares added: "Forced disappearances were at least 
tolerated, whether through action or silent neglect, by the 
country's political and judicial authorities. There is evidence 
of responsibility of members of the Honduran Armed Forces and 
the Nicaraguan contras in the disappearances, especially in 
cases involving foreigners." 
  The ombudsman praised the work done by Honduran media, 
because they were the only media in Central America that 
denounced the disappearances in Honduras. 
  As for the Judicial Branch, Valladares said it was 
characterized by its failure to fulfill its duty of protecting 
Honduran citizens. "The impunity of the authorities, in the 
absence of an investigation, was a factor that fostered these 
crimes," he added. 
  In his report, the ombudsman also makes a number of 
recommendations to the Honduran state, including its duty to 
recognize damages done to the victims and their families and the 
need to grant reparations via a special commission. It also 
recommends the creation of a central registry of arrested people 
that would be under the Public Prosecutor's Office and would be 
open to everyone. The report also calls for the approval of a 
special law on those arrested, specifying their rights and 
responsibilities. 
  Valladares pointed out that the Honduran state must ask the 
governments of the United States and Argentina to provide 
information on the identity of people who were working in the 
country at the time of the disappearances, and, if need be, 
locate and extradite members of the Nicaraguan contras. 
  It also recommends the establishment of a commission to 
locate clandestine cemeteries and the construction of a monument 
bearing the names of all those who disappeared as a symbol of 
Honduras' vindication before the international community. 
  When asked whether he felt any pressure or fear, Valladares 
said absolutely not. He added: "I actually met with silence 
and have felt lonely. I have no fear. This is the truth. If 
not being afraid is a crime, there is no hope for our country."

<F P=106> [Report by Romulo Matamoros from "The Morning Paper" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Through Lieutenant Colonel Napoleon Santos Aguilar, 
Armed Forces public relations director, the Honduran Armed 
Forces has commented on the report issued by Human Rights 
Ombudsman Leo Valladares Lanza. Regarding the recommendation 
that the files on people arrested by the Honduran Armed Forces 
be opened, he said: 
  [Begin recording] [Santos] I am going to tell you something: 
Leo Valladares never said that. Valladares said that at one 
point he requested some information that definitely reached him 
a little late. That is what I understand. 
  [Unidentified reporter] But when he says he would rather 
have 
you provide this information, this tacitly means that you did 
not want to give the information to him. 
  [Santos] Look, there was an exchange of some letters. I 
understand that his letters were answered by Colonel [Herbert] 
Munguia and by the general auditor of the Armed Forces. Some 
information was provided to Leo Valladares by the chief of the 
Armed Forces. [end recording] 
  The public relations director was asked whether the Armed 
Forces are willing to provide information regarding the possible 
participation of Armed Forces members in cases of missing 
persons. 
  [Begin Santos recording] Look, there is something basic in 
all of this. We definitely understand and acknowledge the work 
of Leo Valladares. If there have been some misunderstandings, I 
think it has been strictly due to a lack of communication. 
  I understand this is a report that was presented to the 
Honduran president by the human rights ombudsman. Valladares 
has compiled a large amount of information, and he requested 
that legal steps be continued to once and for all resolve the 
problem of missing persons. We, the Armed Forces, are waiting 
to see the report. I think it would be hasty on my part to give 
you an official opinion on the report because I know that you 
are just now reporting on it. 
  We are obviously part of this country's Executive Branch, 
and 
legal channels must be followed. We will wait and see what the 
courts will do, because they are the appropriate institutions to 
deal with this. [end recording] 
  Santos Aguilar justified the current Armed Forces chief's 
absence from the country. He left yesterday before this report 
was presented. In the report, he was mentioned as head of 
Battalion 3-16 in 1984. 
  [Begin recording] [Santos] Like I said, if General Discua is 
not in the country, well... [pauses] As members of the 
military, we divide our activities into two groups to avoid 
neglecting our responsibilities in the country. I understand 
that the commander in chief was here up until yesterday, which 
was the day when the individuals who were to take over today 
reported for duty. 
  At this time, General Andino, chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of 
Staff, is acting as head of the military institution. 
  On another topic, I heard Leo Valladares' recommendation on 
the appointments of some officers. You can be sure that 
whenever any individual is summoned by the courts, the Armed 
Forces will have nothing to hide. 
  [Reporter] When you say the Armed Forces are under the 
Executive Branch, does this mean that the next administration 
will have to decide whether those who led these battalions are 
responsible for the cases of missing people? 
  [Santos] No, I am not saying that. I am speaking about 
strictly legal aspects. The Armed Forces are part of the 
country's Executive Branch and appropriate channels exist 
through the president for specific situations. 
  [Reporter] As members of the Armed Forces, how willing are 
you to turn over to the courts individuals who are linked to the 
cases of missing persons? 
  [Santos] Let us wait and see what the courts of justice say 
in this regard. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Morning Paper" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Carlos Sosa Cuello, PINU [Innovation and Unity 
Party] deputy has charged that the U.S. position of supporting 
the clearing up of missing persons cases in Honduras is 
hypocritical because the people in Washington originally 
promoted and fostered this type of criminal action. Meanwhile, 
Sosa fears that actions may be taken against witnesses in these 
cases after the release of the preliminary report by Human 
Rights Ombudsman Leo Valladares. The report could revive the 
memories of the violent actions that led to more than 100 
missing persons. 
  This morning, Deputy Sosa levied serious allegations against 
the U.S. Government, saying it is greatly responsible for the 
more than 100 disappearances during the 1980's. Likewise, he 
insinuated that a controversy could arise between the relatives 
of the missing persons and those accused of being responsible 
for the disappearances. Here is what Deputy Sosa Cuello said: 
  [Begin recording] [Sosa] I think the United States, 
specifically the Reagan administration, had a leading role in 
this matter. They trained our forces; they armed the Honduran 
forces; and they trained them in torture, interrogation 
techniques, and methods that led to the disappearance of people. 
Now, from Washington, they have the gall to cry out, as if 
horror-stricken, in favor of human rights. Only a decade ago, 
these very rights were violated under U.S. instructions, 
encouragement, and support. The United States almost demanded 
this. This is typically hypocritical of the empires that preach 
one set of morals and practice another. This is very 
characteristic of the Calvinist moral system: It upholds success 
as the only human goal, regardless of the means or mechanisms 
used in achieving this success. It has a philosophical 
antecedent in Machiavellianism; it is typically Calvinistic and 
Protestant; it is very characteristic of this empire's moral 
values. 
  [Reporter] What they applauded before, they now reject, 
right? 
  [Sosa] Concerning what they fostered and demanded before, 
they are now horror-sticken. On certain occasions it is the 
very same actors who participated. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] in this case the U.S. empire. 
  [Sosa] This is what they call political pragmatism. It is 
the securing of results as the primary goal of men of state. 
This is not true. The means should be in keeping with the ends 
to allow our actions to ethically respond to the goals for which 
we are fighting. One cannot champion democracy and liberty by 
murdering or, even worse, by fostering murder and then 
subsequently appearing horror-sticken by what one has fostered. 
To me, this is philosophically and ethically unacceptable. 
  [Reporter] Who is more guilty, the United States or the 
Hondurans who were in power at that time? 
  [Sosa] I think we Hondurans should place historical and not 
criminal responsibility on those who held high-ranking positions 
at that time in our nation. It would be wrong for us to judge 
the foreigners without first judging our own people. When I 
make this statement regarding the imperialists' hypocracy, I do 
this from an Honduran point of view, and I am doing this in an 
effort to prevent this from ever happening again in Honduras. 
  [Reporter] Do you not fear that this report will create 
discord between the two sides? 
  [Sosa] I would like this report, its final conclusions, and 
the actions that the attorney general -- still unknown to us as 
of this time -- could or not take to put an end to this chapter. 
I would like this report not to refresh memories of an era that 
we Hondurans should forget, precisely so that it is not repeated 
and not relived. 
  [Reporter] What does this refreshing of memory mean? 
  [Sosa] It means the possibility of leaving the door open -- 
a 
green light, so to speak -- for actions against possible 
witnesses, against possible depositions, or that this could be 
used by certain sectors against their adversaries. 
  [Reporter] Currently, are there threats between the groups? 
  [Sosa] I hope not. I hope that the investigations, the legal 
actions, and the meaning of the amnesty granted by Congress will 
put an end to the situation and create one in which the Honduran 
state has greater interest in compensating the relatives and 
descendants of these victims of violence than in seeking 
revenge. We should do more to educate the children of the 
missing persons to guarantee them a future instead of procuring 
vengeance, which is one of humanity's basest emotions.

<F P=106> ["Text" of New Year's message to the people of Nicaragua by </F>
FSLN Secretary General Daniel Ortega Saavedra; issued in Managua 
on 31 December] 
  [Text] Nicaraguan brothers: With the Christmas festivities 
and the farewell to 1993, the Nicaraguan people must meet 1994 
with hope. 
  Wise principles tell us: "When a society is in order, a 
single fool cannot alter it." Nevertheless, "when a society is 
in chaos, a sole wise man cannot order it." The latter is our 
reality. The country is becoming more chaotic every day, and, 
in 1994, we cannot and should not continue to think that the 
solution to our problems lies exclusively in the hands of the 
government or in the head of one of the many political, union, 
or guild leaders. 
  We have to start being responsible and start accepting the 
fact that the way out of this chaos has to be reached by each 
and every Nicaraguan who lives, dreams, and struggles in this 
small country of lakes and volcanoes. 
  We must nourish our faith, and we must hope for a better 
future for the people of Nicaragua. We have to respect one 
another and listen to what we are saying, and we need to look 
for the positive aspects in each other's words. We have to 
foster trust and not see ourselves as enemies, let alone allow 
ourselves to treat one another as enemies. We have to make a 
real and deliberate effort to achieve reconciliation with deeds 
rather than with words. It is true that our country is small, 
but it has resources and riches which, if rationally exploited 
and justly distributed, will bring wellbeing to all Nicaraguans. 
  To promote the citizens' trust and faith, the government 
must 
listen to the demands made by the different sectors in 
Nicaragua, and it must comply with the commitments it has made 
and still has not kept. The government must be the first to 
respect the Constitution and the laws to strengthen the state of 
law. 
  The government must realize that we live in a period of 
transition and that it has the duty of advancing joint 
decisions, especially those related to economic policies when 
they refer to negotiations with international organizations. 
  UNO [National Opposition Union] politicians and Cosep 
[Higher 
Council of Private Enterprise] members: We must find a solution. 
The boards of the UNO political parties and producers guilds, 
such as Cosep, must take into account that we must all find a 
way out of the crisis. This requires a great deal of maturity, 
flexibility, and understanding. We have to understand that the 
search for solutions to the crisis should benefit everyone. 
  There is a great distance between preaching and practicing 
democracy -- a distance as great as the one between heaven and 
hell. The challenge confronting all Nicaraguans is that we have 
to make tangible the democracy we have been preaching since last 
century. To this end, it is imperative that we conduct a true 
national dialogue. In turn, the Sandinists today are issuing an 
open invitation to a national dialogue, because we are convinced 
that this is the only way to find solutions to our problems in 
the areas of jobs, housing, health, food, and education, and 
that such a dialogue can lead to economic stability and peace. 
  In the month of January 1994, we call UNO leaders to have 
all 
their deputies join the National Assembly, which will abide by 
the Constitution and will promulgate laws to favor the people, 
workers, and producers. 
  Elections will be held in the north and south Atlantic 
autonomous regions in February 1994. The Sandinists have faith 
that this event will strengthen our country's democracy. We 
have promised to support and promote the candidacies of regional 
leaders and hope the Atlantic region residents will decide to 
vote in a favorable manner and demand that the elected 
candidates be honest and efficient in their administrative 
efforts. 
  The year 1994 is the 15th anniversary of the victory of the 
revolution; it is the year of the 60th anniversary of the murder 
of Sandino; and it is the year of the special FSLN Congress. 
  Sandinists must take bold initiatives to strengthen 
democracy 
within our organization. We are obliged to act with a broad 
mandate to add members, affiliates, and followers to the process 
of debating the modernization of the FSLN program and bylaws. 
  Sandinists have the moral commitment to unite and gather 
around principles, programs, and bylaws that will make our 
organization a democratic and disciplined front committed to the 
causes and ideals of Sandino. This demands that we rescue the 
zeal of Sandino's small peasant army, of the FSLN guerrilla 
detachments, and of the thousands of brothers who gave their 
lives for the freedom of our fatherland in combat against the 
Somozist dictatorship and in the heroic resistance of the people 
against imperialist aggression. This means that we must again 
take up the zeal of the teachers, coffee reapers, and thousands 
of brothers who have been present in all the tasks that the 
fatherland has demanded for its defense. 
  In this way we will guarantee a renewed and modern FSLN, 
which without losing its grass-roots support, will be the hope 
of the impoverished majority, as well as be the best alternative 
to achieve peace, prosperity, and democracy for all the 
Nicaraguans. 
  Nicaraguan brothers: Receive the FSLN's and its National 
Directorate's affectionate salutations and our best wishes that 
1994 be the year in which we will all contribute to the 
stability of our fatherland. 
  [Issued] Managua, 31 December 1993

<F P=106> [Interview with EPS Commander in Chief General Humberto </F>
Ortega by Manuel Espinoza at the Canal Cuatro studios in 
Managua; from the "Extravision" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Espinoza] Thank you, General, for being here 
with us. I think this is a wonderful opportunity for us to chat 
a little about what the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] has 
achieved up until now, especially during 1993, and to hear your 
opinions as a military and political leader in this country. I 
would first like you to give us your view of the country's 
current situation and what you see... [pauses] how you evaluate 
1993 for the EPS? 
  [Ortega] First, Manuel, allow me to thank you for your 
invitation here today -- just a few hours away from year's end 
-- and I also want to thank the rest of the people who work on 
"Extravision." I think this is a good opportunity to point out 
a few things that I believe are very important to give the 
Nicaraguans an awareness about what is going on in our country. 
  As I see it, this has been a crucial year, as far as the 
achievements we have made toward the peace for which the 
Nicaraguan people have been striving for so many years. Ever 
since our struggle began -- and I remember a time in your life 
when you were a student and a member of Patriotic Youths in the 
1960's -- and even now, the Nicaraguan people have been so very 
eager for peace. This peace has cost us blood, sacrifice, and 
destruction. Today, I can say that this year we managed, in 
many ways, to prevent several groups, who took up weapons for 
different reasons, from taking control of political space, as 
well as moral space. These were the recontras, the recompas, 
and the revueltos that operated in various places around the 
country. 
  [Espinoza] In terms of these groups, approximately how many 
people are there still in arms? 
  [Ortega] The important thing is that there are no longer any 
organized expressions or organized groups with any significant 
degree of political support, either foreign or domestic. This 
is over and done with. I think that if you were to carry out a 
survey right now and interview the country's major political 
figures, you would not find a single political or economic 
spokesman or figure here willing to give even the least bit of 
support for any such organized armed expression in any part of 
the nation -- whether this expression comes in the form of 
recompas, recontras, revueltos, or whatever else you may want to 
call it. This is the most important thing: These groups have 
been denied that space. 
  [Espinoza] Has war, as a form of struggle in Nicaragua, 
ended? 
  [Ortega] What ended was the organized expression of illegal 
armed groups. Now, what is left? We believe there are some 
600-800 men dispersed in groups of no more than eight to 12 
each; this is what is left of the larger groups that were 
located at the seven designated enclaves. About 80 percent of 
the forces that were organized as recontras and recompas have 
entered into normal civilian life following the amnesty bill. 
There is a minority left that we have been fighting for the 
past few months. As you well know, we have met with the coffee 
growers and dairy farmers associations. These farmers have 
asked us for a more active presence of the authorities to 
control extortionists, kidnappers, and highway robbers -- in a 
word, all those you already know about. 
  [Espinoza] The farmers have asked for greater presence and 
protection from the EPS in the fields to secure the harvest and 
safeguard the workers. There are certain political sectors who 
have criticized this presence. We recently heard accusations 
from the director of LA PRENSA and all that followed, including 
demands for the EPS to retreat. What would happen if the EPS 
pulled out of the area completely? 
  [Ortega] We have retreated to our bases and are continuing 
with our regular academic and combat training exercises -- 
things that any army needs -- and we are continuing our 
protection operations in support of the production work, which 
is directed at instilling order and stability in the fields. 
This is vital for Nicaragua. 
  If there is no stability, there will be no production. 
Without production there is no economic activity, and without 
economic activity we cannot fight poverty. Poverty and 
unemployment will only end when the economy truly begins to 
move, which in turn will move production. To manage this, 
however, it is crucial that we bring stability to the fields. 
  If we retreat, these small groups will become thousands. 
This is why we cannot leave the fields. It is our 
constitutional duty and it is our nature, as a military 
institution, to go where there is instability to create 
stability. We cannot retreat. As I have pointed out in the 
past, to try and make the Army disappear is to tell the 
Nicaraguans that we want more instability and more war. 
  It is important to realize that ours is a national army. 
It is no longer an army submitted to a political party, as it 
was in the past. In the past, we were a direct expression of 
the Sandinist National Liberation Front, a party. It is no 
longer that way. We know it is important to be an institution 
of the Nicaraguan state that serves all Nicaraguans, regardless 
of their political, ideological, or religious position. 
  [Espinoza] Has the Army's behavior in the countryside been 
suitable, or will you take a look into that? 
  [Ortega] Mistakes and errors can occur in our actions, like 
in the actions of anyone. There have been problems -- scores of 
cases -- that the military authorities have been working on and 
are duly examining to punish those who have committed abuses, as 
I have pointed out. Errors have been committed, but this does 
not mean that we are a genocidal army like Somoza's army, which 
indiscriminately bombed towns. There is a big difference. 
  I have told Cardinal Obando y Bravo that if he had reported 
in a more careful and constructive way that EPS operations had 
endangered the people of the town of Juanito, we would have 
listened to this call and would have told him that we would take 
into account his observations and act more carefully in the 
future. The problem is that a campaign was waged against 
something that had not occurred -- namely, genocide. This kind 
of campaign does not help make things better. Efforts aimed at 
removing the EPS and replacing it with another is like telling 
the Nicaraguan people that there will never be peace here. 
  The truth is that if the EPS were to disappear, which is 
what 
some people want, we would end up having not one but 10 or 20 
armies, because each side will be full of distrust and people 
with diverse ideological and political positions will have their 
own armies. This would be a mess. We would have anarchy. 
  [Espinoza] Do EPS actions result from EPS initiatives, or 
does the Army fulfill government orders? 
  [Ortega] We have immediate response mechanisms. If pirates 
from the north or the south violate our waters, our seas, we do 
not have to ask anyone for permission to take action, and the 
Navy does not have to ask me for permission either. The Navy 
has to stop pirates from stealing our shrimp and lobsters and 
from working against our national wealth. 
  Likewise, in the countryside there may exist groups 
kidnapping and killing others. We have coordination plans with 
the Government Ministry and police to support our operations. 
This means we already have guidelines. At a higher level, we 
met with the Presidency in January of last year, and we agreed 
on the general guidelines of plans to fight armed subversion. 
  [Espinoza] General, is it true that you do not want to leave 
the Army, your post of Army commander? 
  [Ortega] That is completely false. In November, we presented 
a draft bill to reform the current military law. The bill 
covers everything related to the military career and my presence. 
  The problem is not whether or not I want to leave. The 
fundamental problem is the precedent that will be set. We, and 
I in particular, want for the Army to be supported, as soon as 
possible and in the framework of its professionalization 
process, by a new law in order that military processes are duly 
respected by the various national governments that may exist in 
the future. This institution should be seen as a permanent 
institution of the Nicaraguan state, and it should not depend on 
government changes that could take place every six years. 
Otherwise, the institution will be weakened and suffer greatly. 
  I am prepared to leave my post. I think I have played a 
specific role in the formation of a national army which had 
never existed in Nicaragua's history. The EPS is being 
consolidated in an irreversible fashion. All we need is the law 
on the Army. The law needing approval duly establishes when I 
am to leave. Most important is this: I will leave because of a 
civilized and modern institutionalization process and not 
because of foreign pressure or because of the whims of people 
who not only want me to leave, but also want to put an end to 
the Army and to humiliate us. This is what we cannot accept. 
  [Espinoza] If this law were approved in 1994, would you 
leave 
in 1994, as the president has said? 
  [Ortega] It is most important that my retirement be a true 
consequence of the Army's institutionalization and modernization 
process and not result from moments when polemics existed 
because of pressure, or result from a lack of understanding, or 
from situations we do not want to encourage. The date of my 
retirement is not important but, rather, how I take this step 
without going against the principles, the dignity, or, 
especially, the pride of the Army, which cannot be subjected to 
foreign pressure or to whims. 
  If an agreement were to be reached and my departure covered 
by a legal framework, then this would prove to be a decision 
made by the Nicaraguan people and not the product of foreign 
pressure. My departure would then be an expression of maturity. 
This is why the way in which this law is discussed is 
important. It is also important that our character is evident 
during an appropriate and honorable departure, which is what we 
want. 
  [Espinoza] Let us suppose that these conditions are not met 
in 1994 and that you, because of what you have explained, do not 
retire. Would that not be the same as disregarding the 
authority of the president, who has insisted on your retirement? 
  [Ortega] I think it is important to trust that we will reach 
an agreement with the executive to contribute to the country's 
stability. This is what is most important. In terms of a lack 
of compliance with the executive, I think we are functioning 
within the framework of current laws. According to the 
Constitution and our current laws, we are acting legally and 
appropriately. I believe it is important to follow the law. 
The political aspect is also important, as is the image of 
maturity that the Nicaraguan people -- and, in particular, their 
leaders -- must display. I hope we may have a suitable dialogue 
with President Chamorro to overcome the lack of understanding 
and vexation that was created on 2 September and ultimately find 
a way beneficial to all Nicaraguans. This should not be viewed 
as injuring the nation's pride or honor but, rather, as a 
contribution to modernity, institutionality, and the law. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Espinoza] One final question: During the past decade, the 
Army and various sectors of the population faced a war that was 
publicly and officially sponsored by parts of the U.S. 
Government. Our Army and people confronted the United States. 
How would you describe now the relations between the EPS and 
the U.S. Government and its agencies? 
  [Ortega] I think they have evolved favorably. We have 
excellent relations with the U.S. Armed Forces within the 
framework of the current U.S. Administration's policy of 
limiting U.S. military cooperation with Latin American and 
Central American armed forces. The United States has a policy 
that supports the area's various military institutions, but this 
support is almost trivial. 
  Within this framework we have an adequate relationship. We 
have exchanges, and we have had no significant problem with the 
U.S. Armed Forces. We participate in all the Latin American 
military events that take place. We have been acknowledged. 
Next year we want to have a representative on the 
Inter-American Defense Board. Our representative is not there 
yet, but not because of obstacles, but because we have not had 
enough money to maintain an official there, because it costs 
thousands of dollars to have an official representing the Army 
there, and, so far, we have not had this chance. 
  We have students in France and students who have been in 
Spain. We also have exchanges with the United States. In the 
field of medicine we have had 15 exchanges. We have a U.S. Air 
Force military attache and a U.S. Armed Forces general affairs 
military attache. I think the United States has basically 
realized that Nicaragua's Army is the Army we have. The United 
States now clearly understands that any effort aimed at 
overthrowing this Army by backing those who oppose the EPS means 
immersing Nicaragua in a war that they do not want, because they 
want stability in Central America to enable them to have more 
significant trade relations in the region. 
  The United States views the EPS as a fait accompli. This 
Army is a reality, and the United States has acknowledged this. 
  [Espinoza] We thank Army General Humberto Ortega for being 
on 
"Extravision" this evening. We have talked broadly. We hope 
that this talk cleared doubts and answered the question that 
viewers have probably had for months. Thank you and good night.

  [Text] As a result of the combined efforts of the 
government and the military institutions of the National Police 
and the Army, as well as the result of crime-fighting efforts, 
by the end of 1993, of the 2,000 [figure as heard] armed men who 
had operated militarily in the countryside -- mainly in Regions 
1, 5, and 6 -- about 1,600 had taken advantage of the 
demobilization process and the amnesty. In other words, about 
800 armed men are still operating in a disorganized manner in 
small groups. 
  The Army reported that throughout 1993, there were 247 
clashes, 137 murders, 105 kidnappings, 254 assaults, 58 burned 
vehicles, 19 cases of sabotage, 29 group demobilizations, and 
1,059 confiscated weapons. It is said that the remaining armed 
groups are less important and will be fought through Army 
operations, especially in the coffee zones. Army General 
Humberto Ortega assessed the actions needed to bring about peace 
in the country. 
  [Begin Ortega recording] We can surely say that there is 
greater security now than last year and the year before that. A 
specific example is that early this year and halfway into last 
year, tens of thousands of all kinds of weapons were in civilian 
hands, but they are no longer in their hands because those 
weapons were destroyed. Between 1992 and 1993, we have 
destroyed more than 150,000 combat devices of all types. 
Undoubtedly, removing these weapons has improved security. 
  Moreover, the groups that were here with [word indistinct] 
legitimacy because they had their enclaves, seven enclaves, and 
enjoyed the political support from certain sectors, from one 
side or another, no longer exist. There were several thousand. 
They included El Indomable [Jose Angel Moran], El Chacal [Jose 
Angel Talavera], Pedro el Hondureno [Victor Manuel Gallegos], 
the revueltos [mixed groups of recontras and recompas], and 
others. Those people no longer exist. They are no longer there 
defying the authorities, defying public order, or defying the 
Constitution. They were disarmed thanks to the amnesty. 
  In this way, actually, we have made, objectively speaking, 
some progress in offering security to the country. Now, what we 
have today is a higher crime rate. In other words, the ending 
of the danger of belligerent armed groups of the political sort, 
[words indistinct] has coincided with an increase in the 
socioeconomic crisis and in the crime rate, which is the case in 
all countries. The only difference is that, in our case, there 
are still certain individuals who did not take advantage of the 
peace process and who failed to surrender their weapons. They 
[words indistinct] criminals who have [word indistinct] those 
criminals in small groups. They are dangerous because they 
still have some of these combat weapons. Therefore, this is 
basically the danger we are facing. 
  Undoubtedly, between 1990 and the present, we have 
definitely 
achieved substantial progress in national security. [end

  [Text] A leading member of the Interoceanic Region 
Authority (ARI) and several presidential candidates agreed that 
now is not the time to negotiate the presence of military bases 
in Panama. 
  Mariano Mena, general secretary of the General Confederation 
of Panamanian Workers (CGTP) and a member of ARI, told LA 
ESTRELLA DE PANAMA that the Torrijos-Carter Treaties must be 
fulfilled. The country is in no condition to negotiate the 
military bases. 
  According to the leader, the proximity of the election and 
the political situation do not offer the appropriate conditions 
for modifying the treaty. 
  According to the Southern Command Treaty Implementation 
Office, 9,000 U.S. soldiers and 2,562 civilians work at the U.S. 
bases in Panama along with 5,718 Panamanian civilian employees. 
  David Guerra, presidential candidate for the National Unity 
Mission party (MUN), said Panama has more immediate needs to 
attend to, and modifying the Torrijos Carter Treaty would just 
create more problems. 
  Tomas Herrera, presidential candidate for the Civic Renewal 
Party, said he agrees with former President Jimmy Carter that 
the bases will disappear within the time established by the 
treaty. 
  He indicated that the new government could negotiate the 
treaties responsibly, seeking to increase Panama's income. 
  Herrera pointed out that "Panama could benefit by 
renegotiating the U.S. military bases as Italy, Germany, the 
United Kingdom, Turkey, and Korea have."

  [Text] Arnulfist Party member Guillermo Rolla Pimentel 
[current Panamanian health minister] warned that under no 
circumstance will the Arnulfists negotiate the right to head the 
presidential ticket and if Molirena [Nationalist Liberal 
Republican Movement] and other parties wish to withdraw from the 
government alliance they may do so, but they should know that 
the presidential triumph in the upcoming election belongs to 
Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. 
  When asked if a break-up of the official alliance is 
imminent, Rolla replied that Molirena should be asked as "they 
are the ones breaking-up." Rolla stressed that the sole 
candidate for the 8 May elections is Mireya Moscoso de Gruber 
and that the next government will belong to the Arnulfists. "If 
other government parties are confused and do not have a 
candidate of their own, that is their problem; however, if they 
want to be part of the government in the next elections then 
they should come under the banner of the Arnulfist Party," Rolla 
said. 
  The experienced politician and health minister warned that 
whatever government party wishes to join the triumph of the 
Arnulfist party, must work for the needs of the Panamanian 
people and not for economic and personal interests, or have in 
mind ambassadorial, consular, or banking posts, otherwise they 
will harm the party and the country. 
  Rolla said that whatever party wishes to withdraw from the 
government alliance "can leave" because the Arnulfist Party has 
the capacity to fill all the ministerial posts. The health 
minister insisted that if the Molirena Party leadership decides 
to withdraw from the government coalition, "let them," but they 
must remember that it is "the Arnulfists who call the shots." 
  Lastly, Rolla Pimentel confirmed that his Arnulfist Party is 
holding talks with parties that are progressive, positive, and 
nationalistic, such as the Papa Egoro Movement, National Unity 
Mission, and people from the Christian Democratic Party.

<F P=106> [Article by Lastenia Murillo Munoz] </F>
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara said yesterday that he 
has no responsibility for a possible rupture of the alliance 
between the Arnulfist Party and the Molirena [Nationalist 
Republican Liberal Movement] in light of the 1994 elections, 
because "I respect what was agreed upon in the Santa Maria 
Agreement." 
  Endara noted that he should not be questioned on whether or 
not the alliance will be broken because that issue concerns the 
political parties who are conducting the negotiations. Some 
media have reported that the government alliance between the 
Arnulfist Party and the Molirena was broken once they failed to 
reach an agreement regarding who was going to head the 
presidential ticket. 
  Molirena wants to head the official presidential ticket, but 
the Arnulfist Party believes that Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, the 
widow of former president Arnulfo Arias Madrid, should have this 
position. 
  According to Endara, he took off his "politician's hat" on 8 
November when he promised not to interfere in the electoral 
campaign, and "since then the only hat he wears is that of 
president of Panama." 
  Meanwhile, Education Minister Marco Alarcon said that the 
possible rupture of the government alliance "is a situation that 
was perceived from the beginning given Molirena's 
intransigence." Alarcon believes that "it is disgraceful" for a 
country that the most powerful -- financially speaking -- groups 
try to impose candidacies, and the people must react against 
this intention. 
  Alarcon added that "for moral reasons" Molirena should 
resign 
from the government in light of the fact that "they have the 
power and the money" and it is untrue that "the people will 
allow them to choose our next president."

  [Text] The National Renewal Movement (Morena) was admitted 
yesterday as political party number 14, with full rights to 
participate formally in the 1994 elections. The three Electoral 
Tribunal magistrates presented the Morena Party credentials to 
the leaders of that political organization. After complying 
with this requirement, Morena has the full rights to participate 
in the electoral process and to present candidates for this 
event. 
  Morena President Pedro Vallarino said that the party will 
attempt to be the vehicle for Panamanians who have not had the 
opportunity to participate in politics to do so. He added that 
Morena has talked to several parties, but, until now, has not 
agreed on any alliance for the upcoming elections or to back any 
presidential candidate. According to Vallarino, Morena prefers 
to join independent groups and avoid the political parties, 
because once the latter reach power they end up fighting for 
political spaces. 
  A Morena source also reported yesterday that there is a 
possibility that the group of former Christian Democratic Party 
(PDC) members, who are called "The Brown Ones," may enter the 
Morena party ranks. This decision could be announced next 
Wednesday in a political event that will be attended by Morena 
party leaders and representatives of "The Brown Ones." 
  According to Vallarino, the party has several presidential 
candidate hopefuls, including former Comptroller Ruben Dario 
Carles and Joaquin Jose Vallarino. He said, however, that the 
Morena presidential candidate will be chosen at the national 
convention.

  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, Revolutionary Democratic 
Party (PRD) presidential candidate, reiterated yesterday that 
the PRD will not revive militarism if the party returns to power 
after the 8 May 1994 elections. At the same time, he did not 
disavow the idea of an alliance with Solidarity [Party]. 
  Perez Balladares' statements were made during a PRD 
organized 
lunch meeting with media representatives that took place at a 
local restaurant. According to the PRD candidate, he would be 
very foolish to seek reinstating to the current Public Force 
those military officers charged with subversion and 
administrative corruption who were dismissed after the 20 
December invasion of Panama. He pointed out that there would be 
no type of vendetta against those who are in power today because 
the country can no longer tolerate selfish acts of that type. 
  Perez Balladares currently leads voter preference polls 
followed closely by Ruben Blades, singer and president of the 
Papa Egoro Party. However, PRD opponents accuse Perez 
Balladares of having cooperated with the former military regime 
headed by deposed dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega. 
  On the other hand, Perez Balladares did not discard the 
possibility of an alliance with Solidarity Party which several 
weeks ago structured an alliance with several Civic Crusade 
related parties. These parties have indicated repeatedly that 
they will not negotiate with parties that were at one time close 
to the military regime. At the same time, Guillermo Ford, vice 
president of the Republic and a Molirena [Nationalist Liberal 
Republica Movement] member, described the PRD as the real 
opposition of whom we must all beware.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Vargas] </F>
  [Text] In the year's next to last session, the Legislative 
Assembly approved the national general budget for fiscal 1994, 
which amounts to 3.9034 billion balboas. The 1994 budget bill 
is the largest in Panama's fiscal history, and it is the last 
bill to be presented by President Guillermo Endara's 
administration. Adhering to the constitutional principle and 
mandate of having a balanced budget, the consolidated general 
budget amounts to 3.9034 billion balboas in both revenues and 
expenditures. 
  Contrary to what occurred with the 1993 budget, the assembly 
managed to approve the 1994 budget before ending the current 
period of sessions, which will end today in a formal ceremony 
headed by Legislative Assembly President Arturo Vallarino. The 
legislators discussed the bill's acceptability in the final 
debates. Legislators Gabriel Arosemena of the PDC [Christian 
Democratic Party] and Gerardo Gonzalez of the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party] were the budget bill's staunchest opponents. 
  Delia Cardenas, planning and economic policy minister, said 
the 1994 budget was based on an agreement with the legislative 
branch, adding that this helped expedite its approval. Cardenas 
stressed that state budgets are never large enough to cover all 
of the needs of each and every sector. 
  In general terms, the 1994 budget has two sections: 1) a 
financial section, which gives figures for estimated income and 
spending targets for the different government offices; and 2) a 
rules section, which outlines those procedures that will 
regulate the operational aspect of the budget cycle. 
  According to the budget, the central government has 
operational expenses amounting to 1.5933 billion balboas and 
total investments worth some 843.1 million. The central 
government's current income is estimated at 1.4158 billion 
balboas, while its capital income is estimated at 512.8 million 
balboas. 
  Of the 512.8 million balboas in 1994 estimated capital 
income, some 324.3 million will come from loans from 
international credit organizations. Another 84.6 million 
balboas will come from the sale of state properties, the Bayano 
Cement Co., and buildings in the Colon Free Zone. 
  The budget assigns 843.1 million balboas to investments. In 
this area, those sectors that will benefit most are education 
with 48.5 million balboas, health with 96.1 million, and housing 
with 61.8 million. In terms of debt service, the budget 
includes 631.8 million balboas to be used to pay both foreign 
and domestic creditors. The budget includes 348.3 million 
balboas for foreign debt payments, 283.5 million to cancel the 
domestic debt, 347.7 million for interest payments, and 284.1 
million for amortization.

  [Text] The Armed Forces general command asks that the cycle 
of violence created by division be ended. Without naming the 
serious incidents at the beginning of the week in Cite Soleil, 
the military institution asks all sons of the country for more 
peace and tolerance and expresses hope that the coming year will 
be the beginning of a new era for all, auguring the 
establishment of a real democracy and a state of law 
guaranteeing more justice to all Haitians and better prospects 
for their children. 
  It should be noted that more than (5,000 million) gourdes 
have been collected within the framework of humanitarian 
assistance for the victims of Cite Soleil. Furthermore, the U.S. 
Government is studying the possibility of a long-term 
reaccommodation for those people. A protocol of assistance was 
signed on 29 December between the United States, the Haitian 
Government, and the health centers.

  [Excerpt] The president of the Chamber of Deputies is 
opposed to the project of an international conference in Miami, 
proposed by President Aristide last week. He also is convinced 
that this project is not a winner for his other colleague 
deputies. Let us listen to Mr. Antoine Joseph at Edner Jean's 
microphone: 
  [Begin Joseph recording in Creole] I encourage all ideas 
that 
allow Haitians to sit together and discuss, whether it is at an 
international or national conference. However, I think that the 
political parties in the Parliament should give their opinion on 
the idea of the national conference, as the invitation was sent 
to them. If they reject it, then the idea will fail. Right now, 
many political parties favor the national conference. Some of 
them have said no. As I had already supported the national 
conference, I still support it. This is because I think it can 
embrace more subjects than an international conference. Many 
people think that the Haitian crisis must be repatriated, and I 
am not totally against that idea. Let me remind you that the 
Washington protocol agreement was signed between the 
international community and partly the Parliament. Although two 
Haitians signed the Governors Island Accord, it was with the 
mediation of the international community. What would be better 
is to have the international community broaden the framework of 
the negotiations and the search for a solution by inviting 
several sectors-- such as political parties, the labor unions, 
the peasant organizations, the active sectors of national life, 
and the social professional associations. All those people 
should sit together in order to find a solution. [passage

  [Text] The year is ending in less than twelve hours. This 
year was extremely difficult for the Haitian people who hope for 
a different kind of year for 1994. On the occasion of this end 
of the year, politicians and legislators invade the radios and 
the press to address the nations. In various messages, those 
political and parliamentary personalities are calling for a 
solution to the crisis. 
  First of all, the Senate president calls on Haitians to 
overcome narrow concepts and to keep what is essential. In his 
message, Firmin Jean-Louis asks the various protagonists of the 
crisis not to consider themselves the unique holders of truth. 
The president of the National Assembly believes that national 
reconciliation is still possible in 1994. Here is a summary of 
this speech, made on 30 December by the Senate president, with 
Edner Jean: 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] Of 1993, Firmin Jean-Louis will 
carry a souvenir of the year loaded with anguish, broken dreams, 
a country that has reached rock bottom. However, he recalls that 
1993 also carried with it the most ambitious dreams -- the dream 
of seeing the resolution of the crisis on the one hand, and on 
the other, a new start including democracy, a state of law, 
economic and social progress. It is the opposite, however, that 
the Senate president observed this 30 December. He noticed among 
other things the pauperization of the middle class, the 
annihilition of the country's deprived classes, a phenomenon 
caused by the worsening of the economic situation. 
  On the political plane, it is generalized institutional 
crisis: The state runs on the sly; the Cassation Court lodged an 
appeal against a decree pensioning off its president; the 
supreme audit court and its administrative litigation are 
floundering in an unending internal crisis; the government is 
basically headless; the parliament is working administratively, 
but without political efficiency, notes the president of the 
National Assembly, before adding that from this absence of a 
state follows the emergence of nonconventional forces which 
exercise enormous pressures on the entire society -- pressures, 
threats, and even violent and deadly actions. He takes as proof 
the latest events in Cite Soleil. 
  [Jean-Louis] The systematic violations of human rights did 
not stop multiplying. The most recent and horrible episode would 
perhaps be the one in Cite Soleil about 72 hours ago. Assured of 
impunity, individuals, in broad daylight, put the burning torch 
to more than 200 small houses, leaving fathers and mothers in 
despair, mourning, and in fear of counting their dead ones. 
  [In Creole] About three days ago, we know what happened in 
Cite Soleil, where people set fire to more than 200 family 
houses. They killed people, and people are so afraid they dread 
counting the dead bodies. 
  [Jean] However, he refuses to speak of definitive failure, 
nor that he sees futility in the painful sight of a nation 
seeking its way. President Firmin Jean-Louis, and with him the 
entire Senate, are rather of a constructive, productive 
optimism, expressing a desire to see Haitians triumph in the 
concepts of great and small concord, in order to keep what is 
essential: the reconciliation of the nation with itself. 
  [Jean-Louis in French] To President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
to Prime Minister Robert Malval and the government's members, to 
the general command and members of Haiti's Armed Forces, to the 
leaders and members of the various churches working in the 
territory, to the political leaders, to the labor unions, the 
socioprofessional associations, to the students, members of the 
media, to the representatives of the international community, to 
the 18 January elected legislators who voluntarily agreed to 
refrain themselves until the seating of the arbitration 
committee that we impatiently await, to all of you, Haitian 
brothers and sisters from here and everywhere in the world, we 
fervently wish you courage, health, and happiness. 
  May each of us stop considering himself the unique holder of 
the historical weight of our founding ancestors. May we be able, 
Haitians and foreigners, to show restraint in the face of 
another's opinion. Then and only then will there be a start in 
Haiti, an era of a state of law and, we hope to see one day 
[word indistinct] of new times, awaited by all. 
  [Jean] Through this message at the end of the year, Firmin 
Jean-Louis showed that he still enjoyed the trust of the other 
members of the Senate Bureau who all supported his statements, 
but silently, as if to say that a compromise is still possible 
between the Alliance and the constitutionalists. [end recording]

  [Text] There is a running battle going on between the 
leaders of CONACOPP [National Confederation of People's 
Organizations of the Country]. According to a communique issued 
this week by CONACOPP coordinator Cherestal Vanes, he had 
decided to expel Saurel Beaujour from the confederation because 
of a lack of harmony between Beaujour and the other members of 
the organization. 
  Beaujour in turn accuses Vanes of depositing a check for 
$600 
in his personal account. This Indian wrestling match is taking a 
new turn. 
  The latest note from CONACOPP, dated 29 December, signed by 
nine members of the organization's national secretariat, 
formally denied the letter from Cherestal Vanes, who had 
personally made the decision to expel Saurel Beaujour. The 
communique says that the CONACOPP national secretariat was never 
aware of the facts mentioned in Vanes' letter. The secretariat 
asserts that Saurel Beaujour has always had exemplary behavior 
within the organization, which has not been true of Cherestal 
Vanes. The secretariat also took this opportunity to announce to 
the national and international organizations that Cherestal 
Vanes is no longer CONACOPP spokesman.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Itamar Franco by Silvania dal </F>
Bosco in Rio de Janeiro on 15 December and in Juiz de Fora on 16 
and 17 December] 
  [Text] [Dal Bosco] What are Brazil's priorities for next 
year? 
  [Franco] The constitutional reforms longed for by the 
people. 
The tranquility and normality of the elections. The curbing of 
inflation. The consolidation of our economic growth. The 
permanent and effective struggle against starvation and misery. 
The eradication of all forms of violence. The recovery of 
self-esteem. Health as everyone's legitimate right and school 
for all. And finally, for our happiness, winning the World Cup. 
  [Dal Bosco] What should Brazilians expect from President 
Itamar Franco in 1994? 
  [Franco] Work, being aware of his duties and obligations, 
maintaining democratic order, and a strict and direct communion 
and unity of purpose with Brazilian society. 
  [Dal Bosco] Is there any risk of a military coup or a 
rupture 
in the democratic order in Brazil? 
  [Franco] No, absolutely not because I firmly believe the 
political conditions in our country have matured, and the 
democratic institutions have definitely found their direction. 
They are becoming more solid as shown by the recent historic 
events. 
  [Dal Bosco] Having governed for one year, do you believe 
that 
your own expectations have been fulfilled? 
  [Franco] I believe so. There is no doubt that Brazil has 
grown. It has grown to such an extent that this year shows a 
GDP growth of nearly 5 percent and a 14 percent growth in 
industrial production. Although, it is obvious that the country 
still has a very high inflation rate. Therefore, we hope that 
with Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic plan it will 
be possible to substantially reduce inflation when fiscal 
readjustment goes into effect. In addition the government 
desires the patriotic cooperation of Congress and of all 
segments of society. Next week I will have been at the head of 
the government for one year. I am certain that 1994 will be 
very good for the country. If there is nothing else that I can 
do, then I will democratically pass the government on to my 
successor, hoping that he will find a country that is socially 
more just and economically more solid. 
  [Dal Bosco] Which country would inspire you if you could 
somehow magically mold Brazil's future? 
  [Franco] I am from the working class, by excellence and by 
roots, and I have been molded in the class of Alberto Pasqualini 
(the Rio Grande do Sul State lawyer is considered to be the 
father of the Brazilian working class. He was a town councillor 
and a senator, he supported the movement that put Gertulio 
Vargas in power in 1930, and he was a minister of state under 
Vargas in 1944. Leader and theoretician of the PTB [Brazilian 
Labor Party], Pasqualini helped to draw up the party's charter. 
In 1948 he published the Fundamental Directives of the Brazilian 
Working Class, which was adopted as the bible of the PTB. In 
the publication, he defends the thesis of extirpating "social 
usury" from the country, something that is contained within the 
economic relations that do not take social justice into account. 
Pasqualini died in 1960 at the age of 58). 
  [Dal Bosco] Are you sure that Fernando Henrique Cardoso's 
plan will be successful? 
  [Franco] It is not Cardoso's plan. It is a government plan. 
But I can tell you something: I will not allow the country to 
fall into a recession, but that is not the case. Never in 
modern history has someone supported an economy minister as I 
have supported Minister Cardoso. I have just lost two excellent 
advisers because they disagreed with the economic plan. One of 
them is an excellent ambassador (referring to former Culture 
Minister Geronimo Moscardo) and the other is a loyal party 
leader and a very good fighter (referring to Deputy Roberto 
Freire). 
  [Dal Bosco] What do you intend to do if you become convinced 
that the plan will lead to a recession? 
  [Franco] If that should happen, something which I do not 
believe, I will tell the minister to stop and we will have to 
find another alternative. 
  [Dal Bosco] There are those who contend that you, Mr. 
President, support [Finance] Minister Fernando Henrique 
[Cardoso] from a technical standpoint, but that in your heart, 
you agree with former [government] leader Roberto Freire, who 
criticizes high interest rates and recession. 
  [Franco] The heart has reasons that the mind itself cannot 
fathom. 
  [Dal Bosco] How so, Mr. President? 
  [Franco] Simply that -- the heart has reasons that the mind 
itself cannot fathom. 
  [Dal Bosco] Are you, Mr. President, in favor of the 
reinstatement of the 100,000 civil servants that were dismissed 
during the Collor administration? 
  [Franco] I am in favor of injustices being redressed, 
period. 
Our first proposal originally contemplated only the 
re-examination of those cases that involved a flagrant breach of 
the law or an injustice. Furthermore, even according to the 
most pessimistic estimates, those cases do not add up to 
100,000. If the project were to be passed by the Senate, to 
maintain its original spirit and become law, we would then 
re-examine the cases of those who believe they have suffered 
some damage and plead their reinstatement on a case-by-case 
basis. The reinstatement will never be automatically done. 
  [Dal Bosco] Are you personally in favor of ending the 
state's 
monopoly in the oil industry and telecommunications in the 
constitutional reform? 
  [Franco] Personally, I am not. However, one has to bear in 
mind what decisions and alternatives are the most appropriate 
ones for the historical moment we are living in Brazil and for 
the current economic and social order. 
  [Dal Bosco] The CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] 
... 
  [Franco] (interrupting) The CPI is an affair that pertains 
to 
Congress. 
  [Dal Bosco] Would it be possible to strike an alliance 
between the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and the 
PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] for the forthcoming 
presidential elections? 
  [Franco] What I can tell you with regard to the elections, 
is 
that the three coming months -- January, February, and March -- 
will be decisive for the country, since during that period party 
affiliations will be decided, government officials who campaign 
for election will have to resign, the economic plan will be 
under way, and the CPI will issue its final report. 
  [Dal Bosco] Do you believe, Mr. President, that PC [Farias] 
and former president [Fernando] Collor are scheming against you? 
  [Franco] I do not think that PC is involved in such a thing. 
My relationship with him was limited to the election campaign. 
I spoke with him on very few occasions. 
  [Dal Bosco] And how about former President Collor? 
  [Franco] I think that he is. I read about the accusations he 
leveled at me in VEJA, but did not want to answer them. 
However, after thinking about it, I decided to write some 
lines. (The president excuses himself, leaves the room, and 
comes back with a typescript in his hand. He slowly unfolds the 
paper and reads the following:) "From the Olympus, located in 
the celebrated Casa da Dinda [Collor's official residence in 
Brasilia], that deposed little god fires his machine gun of 
half-truths and insidious innuendoes seeking to smear other 
persons' honor. It seems a most coherent attitude with the 
personality and feelings of those who disdain other persons' 
uprightness because they do not have it." This is the first time 
that I have responded to that individual. Up to now, I had 
tried to show my respect for and keep my distance from the 
former president of the Republic. 
  [Dal Bosco] Mr. President, does PC Farias' ghost check 
deposited in the account of your secretary Geraldo Faria exist 
after all? 
  [Franco] If there was a ghost check, we did not know about 
it 
at that time. Furthermore, who would have imagined the 
possibility of the existence of ghosts back in 1989? There is a 
check for the campaign, but it has not been issued for the 
absurd amount that is being said. (Franco refers to the rumor 
that it was a check for $700,000, when in fact the only one 
found was for $145,000). Besides, Faria is a very tidy person. 
He kept all the documents, notes that prove where the money was 
spent. The checks for the campaign were even deposited in other 
accounts. My account has absolutely nothing. PC Farias or 
anybody else may say whatever they want. But, why should only 
the election campaign in Minas Gerais be under scrutiny? 
Especially in the case of Geraldo Faria, who was not the 
treasurer general of the campaign. Are the 1989 election 
campaigns of all candidates being delved into? Former President 
Collor is facing charges for what he did during his presidency. 
One should make it clear that the Superior Electoral Court 
approved the PRN's [National Reconstruction Party] accounts at 
that time. Why study them now? I, Itamar Franco, was neither 
coordinator nor treasurer at either regional or national level. 
That was no concern of mine. 
  [Dal Bosco] The Federal Police seized one of P.C. Farias' 
personal appointment books, where he had marked a meeting with 
you for April 1990, during Fernando Collor's government. Do you 
remember that meeting? 
  [Franco] I did not see Paulo Cesar Farias after the campaign 
ever again. I never called him P.C. because our relations were 
always formal. I do not remember having talked to him after 
Collor took over power. This is why there is no way I could 
have negotiated the nomination of Eliseu Resende to head Vale do 
Rio Doce with him. President Collor recommended Resende to head 
Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc], not Vale. Resende 
was told of his appointment before the swearing-in ceremony, 
when he was still at his former public office. 
  [Dal Bosco] In 1990 you purchased a D-20 pickup truck, and 
then exchanged it for two cars. What is the story behind that? 
  [Franco] I reported everything to the tax department. I kept 
the pickup truck for only a few days. I answered some questions 
about the matter then. I am almost sure that I also sent a copy 
with explanations to Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. I 
do not have copies of the documents here, but I can show them to 
you later. 
  [Dal Bosco] A D-20 pickup truck is worth nearly $35,000. Did 
you have the money to buy the truck? 
  [Franco] Of course I had the money to buy it. Otherwise I 
would not have made the deal. I did not steal the pickup truck. 
My tax record shows that everything was in order. 
  [Dal Bosco] Does a Republic of Juiz de Fora really exist? Do 
you ask its people before making a decision? 
  [Franco] Such a republic has never existed, nor will it ever 
exist. But there is a town called Juiz de Fora that is very 
dear to me. It is not only a picture hanging on a wall. Before 
making a decision I usually hear the opinions of a large variety 
of people, as well as my own heart. 
  [Dal Bosco] Why did you decide to work in Rio de Janeiro 
this 
week? 
  [Franco] There is a very simple reason. I had more than 20 
requests for audiences from people or groups established in Rio 
de Janeiro. I simply decided to receive those people in the 
city. 
  [Dal Bosco] Didn't you want to send a message to the country 
indicating that everything was calm? 
  [Franco] It might be understood that way. There is calm and 
tranquility in the country. There is no need for the president 
of the Republic to stay in Brasilia. The country has its 
democratic order ensured, and there are no risks. I can tell 
you before you ask that I never thought of resigning as 
president of the Republic. 
  [Dal Bosco] Are you tired? Do you wish you could take some 
days off to rest? 
  [Franco] The other presidents did not have vacations, 
either. 
As far as I can remember the only exception was President 
Getulio Vargas. He used to spend a few days at the Palacio Rio 
Negro, in Petropolis, in Rio de Janeiro. The president should 
have some 20 days or so to rest, in a place of his choice, in 
Brazil. Obviously he could not be traveling back and forth. He 
would stay at a single place. I only have one more year as 
president, and I do not think of that possibility. But I will 
ponder about the idea, for the future. After all, everyone has 
the right to some rest: journalists, physicians, lawyers, the 
president of the Republic. I need the Brazilian press to 
understand that, too. Society, I am sure, understands it. 
  [Dal Bosco] Why did you lose patience with the press in Juiz 
de Fora? 
  [Franco] I recall very well an O GLOBO photographer asking 
me 
when I left my apartment whether I wanted to talk. I answered 
no, and left for a friend's place, but journalists followed me. 
I think they should not do that, but I understand that it is 
their job. When I arrived at my friend's house, the 
housekeeper, who is a humble person, asked the journalists to 
withdraw. No one listened. They invaded private property and 
followed the car. They entered nearly 70 meters inside the 
property. This is no way to earn respect. If they wanted to 
take my picture they had a chance when I left my apartment. I 
think the incident showed a lack of respect. Where I come from 
you do not enter someone else's house without knocking at the 
door first. You only trespass through an open door if it is a 
church. I would not walk into a friend's house without 
knocking, even if the door was open. It is a matter of good 
manners. One of these days we will have a more serious 
incident. Journalists will find a more courageous housekeeper or 
security guard. 
  [Dal Bosco] But wouldn't a security team avoid the problem? 
  [Franco] No. I think the incident could have been worse. I 
politely asked the reporters to leave. Security guards could 
have beaten them. I believe that with security guards it could 
have been worse. To tell you the truth I would rather drive my 
own car. I don't drive one because I don't like driving. 
  [Dal Bosco] With no security guards, don't you fear an 
attack? 
  [Franco] Security is necessary, but it depends on where I am 
going. I want to have political and democratic visibility. 
When I am in my hometown with my daughters I do not think the 
bodyguards are necessary. Concerning a possible attack, I have 
no fear. U.S. presidents move in armored helicopters and 
limousines and they still die. Bodyguards would not prevent 
someone from killing me. 
  [Dal Bosco] Is it true that pompous ceremonies at Planalto 
Palace bother you? 
  [Franco] Ceremonies with much ostentation I do not like. I 
think they are too artificial. But I do obey the rules. I do 
everything the protocol chief orders. But I try to do it in the 
simplest manner. For instance, the granting of credentials to 
ambassadors was a pompous ceremony. I even had to wear black 
tie. Why wear black tie to receive ambassadors? The simpler 
ceremony is more human. I think most people also think that 
way. They tell me they would rather have simpler ceremonies. 
  [Dal Bosco] Are you dating someone? 
  [Franco] Who knows? I do not want to talk about it. I do 
not talk about my intimate life. I do not ask a reporter 
whether she is dating someone, or whether she is in love 
(laughs). 
  [Dal Bosco] What do you like doing on weekends? 
  [Franco] Exactly what I am doing now: meeting with friends 
and listening to a good piano player. (At this moment President 
Franco is meeting with friends at the Brasao Restaurant, in Juiz 
de Fora, where he goes every time he is in town. Before, as 
special guest of the group, he attended the graduation of his 
daughter Georgiana, who studied law at the Vianna Junion Law 
School. At the Brasao, he drank beer and ate meat and cheese 
pie. At the piano, Professor Maria Teresa Lerdersnaier, from 
the Music Conservatory, played: Love is a Many Splendored Thing, 
Bolero by Ravel, and the theme of the movie Casablanca, As Time 
Goes By. The piano player has been playing for Itamar Franco 
for more than 15 years, and whenever the president is in town, 
she goes to the Brasao in his honor). 
  [Dal Bosco] Is it good being the president of Brazil? 
  [Franco] It is not a question of its being good or bad. It 
is, above all, a task, and has its gratifying aspects, while 
other decisions and solutions are difficult. 
  [Dal Bosco] What have been your best and worst days in the 
presidency? 
  [Franco] The happiest day I could not say. But one of the 
saddest days was when my mother died on 9 December 1992. 
  [Dal Bosco] How would you like to be remembered by 
Brazilians? 
  [Franco] It will be up to history, with its impartiality, to 
record that.

  [Text] In a meeting with journalists, President Itamar 
Franco bitterly criticized the Supreme Federal Court [STF] and 
the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], but praised the 
National Congress and former Social Security Minister Antonio 
Brito. 
  During the 20 minutes he stayed at the Planalto Palace press 
hall to wish journalists a happy new year, President Itamar 
Franco criticized the Supreme Federal Court and the PMDB, but 
praised the National Congress. He also spoke about ministerial 
reform and the events of 1993. 
  [Begin recording] We have had a year with a very high 
inflation rate, but we must also stress, and stress 
categorically because the newspapers usually do not mention it, 
and if they do, they only refer to it in general terms, that the 
country has left recession behind. 
  The country has managed to reach 1993 with a GDP of 4.5 
percent, with all industrial areas fully recovering from 
recession. We must review several other areas where we had 
speculation, especially the famous pharmaceutical industry. The 
government has not yet been able to control the pharmaceutical 
industry. But the country has grown, especially in the energy 
area and also in its international relations. 
  Thus, we can say that although we had a high inflation rate, 
the country has developed calmly and within a democratic 
environment. And no one can deny that the country has developed 
economically. [end recording] 
  President Itamar Franco also said he is disappointed over 
the 
decision adopted by Supreme Federal Court Justice Marco Aurelio 
de Mello which has granted an injunction in favor of state 
companies continuing to pay super-salaries. 
  According to the president, this decision by Justice Marco 
Aurelio de Mello and the STF does great damage to the country, 
not just to the government. 
  The president of the Republic also took the opportunity to 
praise the National Congress. He said that 
congressional-Executive Branch relations are perfect and that he 
hopes the measures adopted by the economic team to curb 
inflation will be approved. 
  The president also praised former Social Security Minister 
Antonio Brito, but bitterly criticized the PMDB. 
  [Begin recording] Concerning relations with parties, I 
shouldn't say this because I do not want to fight, I do not want 
to disrupt the peace, because I would rather have a climate of 
peace, of love, and of brotherhood, but the PMDB, which until a 
few days ago had five ministers in the government, suddenly said 
that it was not part of the government. How could it not be part 
of the government! It had five ministers holding important 
posts. They were so important that the PMDB has forgotten that 
it had important ministers, including one who helped out in my 
work, who is a friend of mine, and who, in a demonstration of 
loyalty to the government and to the fatherland, had to leave 
his post to run for president of the Republic. I am referring to 
Former Minister Antonio Brito. The PMDB is a party that has 
grown quickly and has participated effectively in the 
government. One has to talk with parties that have ministers in 
the government, but when these ministers deny they are the 
government, then it is better to find intermediaries to hold 
talks with other parties. [end recording] 
  Next Monday President Franco will meet with Senate Leader 
Pedro Simon to discuss names for the Mines and Energy, Industry 
and Commerce, and Agriculture Ministries. The president added 
that the future communications minister must be an expert in the 
area.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Crowning months of secret negotiations 
and reciprocal visits, in early December Brazil and Russia 
signed a broad trade agreement designed to boost their annual 
trade from $200 million to $2 billion within a five-year period. 
The agreement includes cooperation in aerospace research, mutual 
technology transfer of military materiel, joint ventures in oil 
production and construction, and other transactions. 
  Brazil and Russia signed a trade agreement on 3 December to 
increase their annual trade from $200 million to $2 billion over 
the next five years, military correspondent William Waack 
reported in the 4 December conservative daily O ESTADO DE SAO 
PAULO. During his official visit to Russia from 1 to 3 December, 
Brazilian Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Jose 
Eduardo de Andrade Vieira and Russian Foreign Economic Relations 
Minister Oleg Davydov discussed the possibilities of space 
research, transfer of supersonic airplane technology, and 
exports of Brazilian foodstuffs. Waack noted, however, that 
everything still hinges on an interbanking agreement that has 
not even been initiated. 
  During his Moscow trip, Waack continued, Vieira also visited 
the Moscow Space Center and was again told by the Russians that 
they would like to use the Alcantara launch site in Maranhao 
State for the international Iridium project. Vieira spoke 
favorably of the project, which envisages placing roughly 60 
communication satellites in orbit within the next two years, and 
said that he would present it to Brazilian President Franco. 
Moscow's independent, business-oriented KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 4 
December, however, said that plans for Russian participation in 
the project were being developed "at Brazil's suggestion." The 
Moscow state-run news agency ITAR- TASS on 3 December also 
quoted Vieira as saying that he had met earlier in the day with 
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin to discuss 
Brazil's participation in the international Iridium space 
communications project involving the use of Russian Proton 
booster rockets. Brazil's O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 4 December 
cited diplomats familiar with this issue saying that "the main 
obstacle" to this project would soon be removed: The Brazilian 
government is now "willing" to join the Missile Technology 
Control Regime soon, accepting "an international code of conduct 
that does not allow the transfer of the technology for building 
and operating missiles to third parties." 
<H5>  Arms and Aerospace </H5>
  KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 4 December noted that "Russia has long 
been mulling over plans for an outlet to the Latin American arms 
market. Brazil may become a good springboard for the products of 
the Russian aerospace complex. In Moscow, the Brazilian side 
once again expressed interest in joint development of inertial 
guidance systems for space-launch vehicles." 
  O ESTADO of 4 December reported that the Monteiro Aranha 
Group has been negotiating for 18 months with the Russians to 
purchase defense materiel to assemble Russian MiG-29 supersonic 
fighters at the Brazilian Aeronautics Company (Embraer) 
facilities, as well as to buy ships and helicopters. The source 
quoted one of Vieira's advisers to the effect that the Monteiro 
Aranha Group "sought a fait accompli so the Armed Forces would 
have to approve these deals." Moscow's ITAR-TASS and official 
military newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, as well as various Brazilian 
dailies, speculated extensively during September on the ongoing 
negotiations between the two countries over possible swaps of 
Russian war materiel for Brazilian foodstuffs. Rio de Janeiro 
daily JORNAL DO BRASIL on 1 December, however, noted that 
Frederico Robalinho, trade policy secretary of the Brazilian 
Ministry of Industry and Commerce, has denied knowing anything 
about reported Brazilian government purchases of Russian arms. 
According to JORNAL, reports of possible exchanges of Russian 
arms for Brazilian food products began circulating in September 
when Brazilian Army Minister Zenildo Zoroastro de Lucena visited 
Russia. Robalinho, however, commented only that Brazil is 
interested in the purchase of helicopters such as the MI-26, 
spare parts and maintenance of military equipment, as well as a 
nonmilitary ship to replace the "Barao de Tefe" in the 
Antarctic. Robalinho, JORNAL added, described this negotiation 
as "historic" because Brazil and Russia are for the first time 
carrying out an accord that will develop all possible trade 
opportunities. 
  In a related press report, the weekly Sao Paulo news 
magazine 
ISTOE reported on 24 November that the Brazilian Army will 
receive Russian surface-to-air missiles that will be distributed 
to various infantry headquarters. The delivery of the missiles, 
according to ISTOE, will begin early in 1994. In an earlier 
"exclusive" report (ISTOE, 18 November) regarding the 
negotiations between Brazil and Russia, Army Minister General 
Zoroastro lauded the "great efficiency of light arms, 
particularly grenade launchers, manufactured by the Russian 
defense industry. General Zoroastro also announced that talks 
between Brazil and Russia to designate a Brazilian Armed Forces 
attache to Moscow have been concluded; likewise, Russia would 
have an Army attache assigned to Brasilia. 
<H5>  Background of the Accord </H5>
  On 18 November, leading Sao Paulo business daily GAZETA 
MERCANTIL provided considerable detail on the scope and 
background of the then upcoming Russia-Brazil trade accord. 
GAZETA commented that the governments of Brazil and Russia had 
concluded their largest ever economic agreement, the result of 
"authentic diplomatic engineering spanning five years of secret 
negotiations" and the "final intermediation, in the Brazilian 
private sector, by the two Rio entrepreneurial groups, Monteiro 
Aranha and its associate, ITS Participacoes." The accord 
provides for bilateral trade increasing to $5 billion in the 
next five years, with financing from the two governments. The 
annual volume of trade anticipated is almost six times greater 
than the $172 million projected for 1993, GAZETA added. 
  During this period, GAZETA continued, Brazil is committing 
itself to purchasing various Russian arms and ammunition, 
rockets, large military helicopters for use in the Amazon 
Region, special fishing boats and icebreakers, hydraulic and 
thermal turbines and generators, petroleum and its by-products, 
gas, chemical-pharmaceutical products, fertilizers, nonferrous 
metals, primarily aluminum and its by-products, and Portland 
cement. Russia, in turn, will buy from Brazil the following: 
designs for hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants; 
agricultural equipment; beef and pork; soybeans and derivatives; 
sugar, cocoa, and coffee; textiles; and finished and 
semifinished shoes. 
  Two lines of credit have been specially established in the 
"store account" system, GAZETA continued. In sales of raw 
materials and commodities" to Russia, the term of payment will 
be one year and at London Inter-Bank Overnight Rate (LIBOR) 
rates. In exports of equipment, machines, and manufactured 
products, the term will be five years, also at LIBOR rates. 
Banks and firms directly involved are Bank of Brazil, Sao Paulo 
State Bank, Monteiro Aranha, Andrade Gutierrez, Embraer, 
Brazilian Petroleum Corporation (Petrobras), Ceval, Vinicola 
Aurora, Tramontina, Iochpe-Maxion, Grendene, Portobello, 
Olvebra, Artex, and Neiva. 
  KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 4 December said that lines of credit 
from 
the Russian side will probably be provided by Mosbiznesbank, 
Mezhkombank, Imperial Bank, and the Export-Import Bank. 
  The accord also provides for the establishment of "joint 
ventures" including the following enterprises: 
  * Andrade Gutierrez and Monteiro Aranha, in association with 
Agrarian Technologies of Russia, Neftkom, MID-Continent of the 
United States and John Brown of Great Britain, to design and 
build a refinery in Krasnodar; 
  * Brazilian firms and Anglo Resources Ltd. in oil 
exploration 
in the Stavropol Basin; 
  * Monteiro Aranha and Anglo Siberian Oil Ltd. in developing 
the design and construction of a refinery in Krasnoyarsk, as 
well as participating in the consortium to build a bridge over 
the Yenisey River in the same area. 
  Providing an historical perspective to the agreement, GAZETA 
went on to say that from the diplomatic standpoint, this accord 
with Russia has a very special strategic dimension," 
particularly concerning cooperation in "sensitive" technologies 
that will be started with "very small-scale transactions." Such, 
it went on to say, is the case of the association of Embraer 
with the Russian aeronautical and space conglomerate, Aviaprom, 
together with Mashinoeksport, the sectoral foreign "trading" 
company. The two Russian firms presented a formal proposal to 
Embraer to form a multinational group, in which Argentine and 
South African state firms would participate to develop the 
CBA-123, a civilian aircraft that has been gradually developed 
by Embraer. Aviaprom and Mashinoeksport subsequently invited 
Embraer to examine their "Delfine" and "Be-30" models with 
Russian TVD-1500 and TVD-20 turbines of similar performance to 
the U.S. Garrett TRF351-20 that would be used in the CBA-123. 
The three firms then began the technical discussion involving 
the "plan, production, and sales" of a line of agricultural 
planes with two basic models having a capacity of up to 0.6 and 
2.5 tons respectively. 
  The technical discussions, GAZETA continued, were followed 
by 
a letter from Aviaprom President A. Gereshchenko to Embraer 
President Ozires Silva in October 1993 noting that "we have a 
good basis for cooperation." There followed a written invitation 
from Gereshchenko and Mashinoeksport Vice President I. Latin for 
Embraer to participate in "the creation and operation" of the 
Burlak aerospace complex. Both Gereshchenko and Latin had been 
in Brazil in February 1993 in a secret visit to the Alcantara 
launch site in Maranhao, GAZETA pointed out, and then noted that 
10 weeks later, Embraer, Neiva, Aviaprom, and the Myaslshchev 
Design Bureau signed a protocol to launch communication 
satellites from Alcantara. There was, according to GAZETA, a 
parallel accord between the Monteiro Aranha group and Khrunichev 
Enterprise to use Russian rockets as launchers. The Monteiro 
Aranha group also signed an agreement with Rostvertol in Rostov 
to sell large Russian helicopters of the Mil line in Brazil. 
  GAZETA further noted that in September 1993, Army Minister 
General Zoroastro headed a military delegation to Russia to 
study military equipment and missile technologies available to 
Brazil, and added that the Brazilian Government has been trying 
to attract partners to its space program by offering the use of 
the Alcantara site, where satellite launches cost an average 20 
percent less than from any other launch site in the world. In 
addition to Russia, Brazil is engaged in negotiations with 
China, which Strategic Affairs Secretariat Minister-Chief Mario 
Cesar Flores has often called "the partner of the future," 
GAZETA concluded.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 30 
December. 
  Fuel prices will go up 17.49 percent as of midnight tonight. 
Accrued readjustments of alcohol, gasoline, and diesel oil 
prices during the month total 38.59 percent. The price of 
kitchen gas will go up 19.79 percent to guarantee the extension 
of the gas bond, according to a presidential decree published 
last week. (Brasilia Voz do Brasil Network in Portuguese 2100 
GMT 28 Dec 93) 
  Jose Mauricio, Rio de Janeiro mines and energy secreatry, 
reported on 16 December that the Brazilian Petroleum Corporation 
will invest $38 million in the construction of two gas pipelines 
that will link the cities of Macae, Campos, and Cantagalo, in 
the northern part of Rio de Janeiro State. (Sao Paulo GACETA 
MERCANTIL in Portugeues 17 Dec 93 p 16) 
  National Treasury Secretary Murilo Portugal reported 
yesterday that the national treasury registered a 60.7 billion 
cruzeiros surplus in November compared with October when the 
deficit was 89.9 billion cruzeiros. Murilo Portugal said that 
this is the result of an increase in the tax revenues and a drop 
in the expenses. Tax revenues totaled 877.6 billion cruzeiros 
in November, 21.2-percent more than in the same month last year. 
Expeneses were 824.6 billion cruzeiros, a drop of 13.64 percent 
compared with November 1992. (Sao Paulo GACETA MERCANTIL in

figure. Foreign investment was $3.6 billion in October, 
31-percent higher than in September when it was $2.8 billion. 
The accrued investment totalled $23.7 billion in the first 10 
months of the year, 33-percent higher than in the same period 
last year. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 17 Dec 
93 Section 2 p 1) 
  The Federal Revenue statistics reveal that Brazil which was 
among the cotton exporting countries until 1991, with annual 
sales of approximately $150 million, this year became the second 
major world importer of the product. Cotton imports totalled 
$590 million beteween January and October 1993, compared to the 
same period last year, when they were $162 million. Up to 
October, Brazil imported 350 metric tons of cotton, mainly from 
Russia, India, Pakistan, Greece and the United States to meet 
almost 50 percent of the Brazilian consumption which is 
estimated at 780,000 metric tons. (Sao Paulo GACETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 17 Dec 93 p 19) 
  Sergio Magalhaes, president of the Brazilian Association of 
Machine Industries, has reported that mechanical industry 
capital goods totalled $13.42 billion in 1993, 2 percent less 
than last year. This is the sector's worst performance since 
1975. (Sao Paulo GACETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 17 Dec 93 p 10)

<F P=106> [Chilean President Patricio Aylwin's year-end address to the </F>
nation from La Moneda Palace -- recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow countrymen: On New Year's Eve I wish to 
convey to all Chilean citizens and all those who live in our 
fatherland a cordial message of friendship and hope. 
  As this year ends we have legitimate reasons to feel 
satisfied. The recent presidential and parliamentary elections 
concluded a phase of our history in which Chile happily rescued 
its democratic traditions. We Chileans live in peace, 
respecting our legitimate differences and striving to overcome 
them through understanding. Authority is exercised within the 
framework of the law; the peoples' basic rights are respected; 
the state institutions, although they need to be perfected, 
function normally within the framework of our democratic system; 
the country continues to develop. With the limitations 
characteristic of a developing world, Chile grows and improves 
the living standards of its people. Production, income per 
capita, job opportunities, savings, and investments continue to 
grow. Unemployment and inflation rates are dropping. More 
houses, highways, ports, and other infrastructure works are 
being built. The great efforts to improve our public health and 
education systems are beginning to yield positive results. 
  Yet, we must be careful. These achievements which fill us 
with pride and hope must not make us complacent. Although we 
have reasons to be optimistic, nothing justifies any sort of 
vanity or arrogance. We are neither tigers nor jaguars. We are 
one of the many developing countries in the world greatly 
limited by the poverty that affects a great part of our 
population and by our economy's dependency on fully developed 
countries. A single example is enough to show what I mean. 
During the year that is ending, the drop experienced by our 
main exportable goods, as a result of the recession affecting 
most of the rich countries, has reduced Chile's income from 
exports by 8 percent regardless of the fact that the volume of 
our exports has continued to grow. This fact requires that we 
continue with our policy for growth with equity with each and 
every one of us cooperating, according to our own possibilities, 
with the clear understading that work, perseverance, and time 
are necessary to be able to reap the desired results. 
  As we tackle this challenge we must bear in mind that we 
belong to an increasingly interdependent world. This is why we 
must persevere in the effort made during these past years in 
order to increase and strengthen our relationship with the other 
countries of the world and cooperate with them in the task of 
consolidating peace, of increasing and liberalizing world 
commerce, and building a more fair international order. The 
steps we have taken to solve problems and increase cooperation 
with neighboring countries and other Latin American sister 
republics, and our recent acceptance as an APEC [Asia Pacific 
Economic Cooperation] member country represent valuable 
contributions in that regard, that open new possibilities for 
the future of our country. Likewise, the recent agreement 
reached at the GATT Uruguay Round and the approval of the North 
America Free Trade Agreement represent legitimate reasons for 
optimism for our future. 
  In September 1990, before the UN General Assembly, I had the 
honor to urge jointly tackling the poverty problem which is one 
of the main threats to world peace. Accepting this suggestion, 
the United Nations has summoned a world summit on social 
development that will be held in March 1995 and will be 
organized by a committee headed by the Chilean ambassador. 
Therefore, we must, as a country, contribute with constructive 
ideas and promote efficient international agreements so that 
this summit will be fruitful. I urge my fellow countrymen, in 
the year that is comming, to accept this challenge as a national 
commitment. 
  The year 1994 has been declared the International Year of 
the 
Family. It is only natural that human beings value the family 
which, by essence, is the natural home of love and the nearest 
social nucleus we all have. Undoubtedly, some characteristics 
of modern life threaten to undermine the strength of the family. 
  In modern culture, selfishness prevails over love for our 
fellow man. More often than not there is more interest in 
material issues than in people and the desire to have material 
possessions prevails over the desire to have good friends. The 
greed for pleasure overwhelmingly surpasses the willingness to 
make any sort of sacrifice. These facts weaken family ties and 
affect the family's stability, obviously harming its members, 
especially the children. I cordially urge all my fellow 
countrymen to calmly ponder about this very important subject 
and to contribute in the search for the most adequate paths to 
fortify our family life. 
  Next March the new government recently elected by the 
people, 
which will be headed by my friend Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, will 
assume the presidency. I hope the new government will be able 
to continue and strengthen, in keeping with its government 
program, the job of perfecting our democracy, economic 
development, and social justice for which we have worked these 
past years. 
  In addition to thanking my fellow countrymen for their 
support and sense of responsibility with which, in general, they 
have honored my government, I ask them for the same for my 
successor. 
  I wish that the new year will be a year of peace, 
development, and justice for Chile and the entire world. I wish 
happiness to all my fellow countrymen. May God bless you all.

  [Text] Santiago, 28 Dec (EFE) -- The Governments of Chile 
and Nicaragua today signed an Extradition and Judicial 
Cooperation Treaty. The treaty will take effect once the two 
countries' congresses ratify it. 
  The treaty was an idea proposed during the last OAS General 
Assembly in Managua. It was signed by Chilean Foreign Minister 
Enrique Silva Cimma and Nicaraguan Ambassador to Santiago 
Roberto Ferrey. 
  Chilean Justice Minister Francisco Cumplido characterized 
the 
ceremony as "very important," adding that the agreement is a 
step forward in the fight against crimes whose effect go beyond 
national borders, such as terrorism and drug trafficking. 
  Cumplido made it clear that the new treaty will have no 
effect on the extradition petition for Chilean ultra-leftist 
leader Sergio Bushman that Chile presented to Nicaragua months 
ago. 
  Bushman, a high-ranking Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front 
(FPMR) leader, has been sought by Chilean justice since 1987 
when he broke out of a Valparaiso jailhouse while standing trial 
for the contraband of weapons for use against General Augusto 
Pinochet's military regime (1973-90). 
  Bushman lived a few years in Sweden and then moved to 
Nicaragua, where he lives as a political refugee spending his 
time dedicated to the theater, according to what he told 
journalists. 
  Francisco Cumplido said he hoped the Bushman case will be 
resolved before the new treaty takes effect following its 
ratification by the Chilean and Nicaraguan Congresses. 
  Foreign Ministry Legal Department sources said Bushman's 
extradition petition currently is being studied by the 
Nicaraguan Supreme Court.

  [Text] Santiago, 30 Dec (EFE) -- Foreign Minister Enrique 
Silva Cimma today confirmed that the Chilean Government is 
looking into the possibility of resuming diplomatic relations 
with Cuba. He did not specify, however, whether this would take 
place before the change of government on 11 March. 
  Silva Cimma told the media that the subject is being studied 
"carefully" and that "every aspect of what the relationship 
between Chile and Cuba represents" is being taken into account. 
  Diplomatic relations between the two countries were broken 
following the 11 September 1973 coup to oust Chilean President 
Salvador Allende. 
  When Patricio Aylwin assumed the Chilean presidency in March 
1990, relations were restored at the consular level, despite the 
interest of the socialist sector of the governing Coalition of 
Parties for Democracy in fully resuming relations with an 
exchange of ambassadors. 
  Since then, however, there has been a strong rapprochement 
in 
the commercial field between the two countries and several 
Chilean businessmen have invested in the tourism and 
agroindustrial fields in Cuba. 
  From the political viewpoint, Carlos Lage, vice president of 
the Cuban State Council and executive secretary of the Council 
of Ministers, visited Chile in response to an invitation from 
the Chilean Government. Lage said that the invitation was a 
demonstration of the mutual interest in moving toward a gradual 
integration process 
  Last November, Chile voted at the UN General Assembly in 
favor of lifting the U.S. commercial embargo on Cuba. 
  According to political sources mentioned by the Santiago 
daily EL MERCURIO, the Chilean Government wants to resume 
relations before 11 March in view of Cuban President Fidel 
Castro's interest in attending the presidential inauguration. 
  EL MERCURIO goes on to say that within the Chilean 
Government 
there are also some who are against this idea. They consider it 
inadvisable that Castro be at the ceremony because the display 
he makes during his trips abroad might overshadow Chilean 
President-elect Eduardo Frei. 
  According to EL MERCURIO, these sectors also believe that 
Castro might create problems with other countries with which 
Chile wishes to maintain good relations. The daily thus 
recalled the public disputes between Castro and Argentine 
President Carlos Menem a few months ago in La Paz during the 
inauguration of Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 30 Dec (DPA) -- Colombian 
Senator Everth Bustamante today lodged a formal complaint at the 
Attorney General's Office against President Cesar Gaviria for 
having authorized the entry into Colombia of U.S. troops, who 
according to the official version, will build a school and 
repair roads. 
  Bustamante, who is a member of the leftist-center 19 April 
Movement Democratic Alliance, said that Attorney General Carlos 
Arrieta must establish if Gaviria violated the Constitution, 
which empowers Congress to authorize the presence of foreign 
troops. 
  According to the government and the U.S. Embassy in Santa Fe 
de Bogota, 133 military engineers (25 have already arrived) will 
have the mission of building a school and repair roads near the 
village of Juanchaco, on the Colombian Pacific coast. 
  Nevertheless, today the press asks about a possible 
"undercover objective" by the U.S. soldiers, in view that "heavy 
equipment" began arriving that seems "exaggerated" for 
accomplishing the announced mission. Reporters who with 
difficulty observed the landing of the first troops due to 
severe security measures, spoke of the arrival of four vessels 
with five tanker trucks (to transport fuel), more than 20 
trucks, backhoes, ambulances, and 10 jeeps. 
  In the opinion of Bustamante, "no one is so naive to believe 
that U.S. troops are needed to build a little school ... I 
believe that the Armed Forces seek other objectives rather than 
carrying out simple social cooperation work." 
  The governments of Santa Fe de Bogota and Washington have 
explained that the soldiers' mission is part of a cooperation 
agreement and specifically is a plan to improve conditions of 
the inhabitants of Juanchaco, an impoverished village of about 
1,500 inhabitants. Some of the media, especially Santa Fe de 
Bogota's LA PRENSA newspaper, do not rule out that the soldiers 
are carrying out an "undercover" operation against Cali Cartel 
drug traffickers who operate in southwestern Vallde del Cauca 
Department. 
  Nonetheless, Acting Defense Minister General Ramon Gil said 
that the soldiers will only carry out social work "for everyone 
to see," after stressing that no weapons will be used for their 
work. Gil added that the fact that the soldiers bear no arms 
allowed Gaviria to unilaterally authorize their entry into 
Colombia, without requiring advance permission from Congress, an 
idea that is not shared by several political leaders.

  [Text] The U.S. Government gave the Colombian Government 
$700 million to allow 122 U.S. Marines to build a school and 
health center in Juanchaco in southwest Valle del Cauca. That 
sum is equivalent to 56 billion pesos and seems an astronomical 
amount for the two projects. If the Marines' presence in 
Colombia is not approved, the government would have to return 
the money. 
  Right now there is only confusion, mystery, and absolute 
silence toward the media at the port in Malaga Bay. These 
vessels, aboard which the 122 U.S. Southern Command engineers, 
materials, and military trucks arrived, are the only words. 
Everything here has come from the United States. The U.S. 
flags flying on the vessels speak for themselves, because 
neither the gringos nor Colombian military are willing to 
explain anything on camera. They say the whole matter is being 
handled by the Defense Ministry. 
  The "TV Today" newscast was able to contact the gringo team 
leader, who told us that Colombia should be proud to have this 
great assistance from his country. For them, this mission, 
during which a school and a health center are allegedly to be 
built in Juanchaco, is just a complementary training operation 
for the military engineers. This type of operation is almost 
like a generous donation for Colombia. But no one understands 
and no Colombian can conceive of how the United States can 
invest $700 million in something supposedly as simple as a small 
school and a health center. 
  The troops have not been able to disembark because of the 
problems that have cropped up regarding their arrival. Their 
orders were to arrive at port, disembark, and move out 
immediately. The U.S. military says that if the Colombian 
Government's decision is delayed any longer, Colombia would 
simply have to return the $700 million and the U.S. troops would 
go back the way they came. In Juanchaco, meanwhile, the people 
do not seem to want the foreigners around, even though they say 
they are not Marines and that they are not invading Colombia; on 
the contrary, the soldiers say they want to offer our country 
great assistance.

  [Text] Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda disclosed 
yesterday that Colombian and Venezuelan military forces are 
coordinating activities on each side of the border to stop 
kidnappings, extortion, car thefts, and drug trafficking. 
  The defense minister, who was released from the Shaio clinic 
yesterday, said Venezuela's decision to reinforce 
counterinsurgency operations in the border area is appropriate. 
The senior Colombian official said: "We agree with those 
decisions and it seems to us very appropriate that they have 
taken strong measures to control their side of the border area." 
He reiterated that "there is absolutely no problem with the 
Armed Forces. There is permanent coordination and communication 
and we consult with each other on many of the decisions that 
affect security along the border. There is total harmony in 
this regard." 
  The minister said coordination also exists with the 
Ecuadoran 
authorities to stop violent actions. 
  The minister made his remarks after learning about the 
Venezuelan Government decision to create a rural security 
committee to reactivate the specific commando units and 
vigorously deal with the activities of the Colombian guerrillas 
in the border area, where 200 Venezuelan cattle ranchers have 
been kidnapped. 
  Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda said that 1993 has been 
a 
good year for the Armed Forces and the National Police, because 
results were achieved in many fields. The minister announced he 
will return to work in three weeks and he has already begun to 
keep abreast of the issues being handled by his office.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 30 Dec (EFE) -- Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria today called on his country's guerrilla 
groups to renounce violence and seek new paths of dialogue and 
peace. In his end of the year message, Gaviria said: "I am 
speaking on behalf of more than 30 million Colombians in asking 
the violent ones in Colombia to put a halt to their deadly 
intentions, to give up their tragedy, and to return to a 
peaceful life." 
  The president said the country recovered confidence in 1993. 
He noted that he has aimed his efforts at strengthening and 
modernizing the state, at internationalizing the economy, at 
revitalizing justice, and at strengthening the capabilities of 
the Armed Forces. 
  In his final end of the year message as president of 
Colombia, Gaviria stated: "We have learned that nothing is the 
product of the efforts of a single moment, that all achievements 
are the fruit of sustained and collective efforts, and that 
victory is attained when the people place the nation's 
collective interests above their own personal interests." 
Gaviria also invited his fellow countrymen to participate in 
the political campaign and to listen to the proposals of all the 
presidential candidates.

  [Text] Roberto Escobar Gaviria, who is recovering from 
injuries sustained during an attack against him at the Itagui 
Maximum Security Prison, today issued from the military hospital 
a Peace Communique, which was written and signed by his mother, 
Hermelinda Gaviria de Escobar. In the communique, Escobar 
claims to be the spokesman for the Escobar family and the 
arrested members of the Medellin Cartel in various Colombian 
prisons and asks Los Pepes [Persecuted by Pablo Escobar] for 
peace. The brother of the former chief of the Medellin Cartel 
asks his archenemies to seek a negotiated and public solution to 
the conflicts they maintain with his group. 
  Roberto Escobar said his family has maintained a peaceful 
attitude despite the attacks they have sustained following the 
death of the Medellin Cartel capo. Roberto Escobar remains 
under medical surveillance at the military hospital after the 
Pepes attacked him at the Itagui Maximum Security Prison. It 
has been unofficially learned that there is little chance that 
the brother of late drug kingpin Pablo Escobar Gaviria will 
recover his vision following this attack.

<F P=106> [Report by Victor Manuel Reinoso] </F>
  [Text] Ramon Espinoza, minister of the Presidency 
Secretariat, has reported that the Council of Ministers approved 
yesterday the implementation of the value-added tax (VAT) at the 
retail level starting on 1 January 1994. Espinoza added that 
the implementation was approved with certain new exemptions that 
the ministers of finance and Cordiplan [Ministry of Coordination 
and Planning], along with a special commission, were drafting as 
late as yesterday afternoon. 
  The approval of VAT by the government of President Ramon J. 
Velasquez is also contemplating a 15-percent tax hike on luxury 
items, an area led by cars with prices of more than 4 million 
bolivares. 
  Today we reached the goal given to us by the Special Powers 
Act. The Public Registry Law was approved, and minor 
modifications were introduced to the VAT Law, particularly in 
the area of exemptions. The exemptions were expanded in areas 
dealing with goods and services of low-income sectors, but in 
general the law's basic principles will remain. It was also 
agreed to increase taxes on luxury items by 15 percent to 
compensate and make this law more equitable and fair, Minister 
Espinoza explained. 
  The official added that the expansion of exemptions includes 
such items as oil, sugar, paper, and mass consumption goods, as 
well as pensions for low-income people and cultural and sports 
events. The new table of exemptions also includes airplane 
tickets but not international airplane tickets. 
  Espinoza said that the commission would meet yesterday and 
was especially designated to determine which products and 
services will be exempted. 
  The luxury items that will have an added 15-percent tax are 
vehicles worth more than 4 million bolivares, yachts, billiard 
tables, and products such as caviar and salmon, which are 
consumed by high-income sectors. Alcoholic beverages and 
cigarettes have a special tax that went into effect before VAT 
approval. 
  Among the exemptions, the Finance Ministry and Cordiplan 
experts--led by Ministers Carlos Rafael Silva and Hernan 
Anzola--are studying medicines sold by the private sector. 
Espinoza explained that the new exemptions are added to the 
other, comprising 30 percent of the basic market basket. 
  Among the exemptions are products consumed in cafeterias, 
corporate dining rooms, and whatever is purchased in education 
establishments. 
  Espinoza said that the 15-percent tax hike on luxury items 
compensates for the exemptions to keep VAT revenues unchanged 
for 1994, which had been estimated to be approximately 250 
billion bolivares. 
  This amount will be important to correct the fiscal deficit 
and somehow reverse inflation and interest rates, which are 
adversely affecting the production sector. It will also serve 
to balance the bolivar with respect to foreign currencies, 
Espinosa said. 
  The minister said that VAT will allow the government to 
reverse the current picture, adding: "We believe that this is a 
temporary, provisional sacrifice, and if it is implemented 
quickly with certain correctives on public spending, especially 
on debureaucratization, privatization, and decentralization, we 
can correct the fiscal deficit during the next government's 
first or second year." 
  We could have a one-digit inflation figure, stabilizing 
interest rates so that the production sector can generate more 
goods, services, more jobs, and satisfaction, Espinoza added. 
<H5>  80 Million in Propaganda </H5>
  Meanwhile, Rosana Ordonez, director of the Central 
Information Office [OCI], has said VAT approval means that the 
tax will be effective on 1 January in its second stage with the 
application of Regulation Two, namely, at the retail level. 
This is so because until now VAT is only being applied at the 
importer level. 
  Therefore, the government, Finance Ministry basically, will 
initiate an information campaign that consists of explaining to 
consumers how VAT is paid, of what the crossed tax [impoesto 
cruzado] consists, what the exempted items are, what the 
tax-paying items are, and how bills are made and in what 
outlets, Ordonez said. 
  She said that this campaign, which has had international 
advisers' support, will be publicized on radio, television, and 
in the written press, and a series of short television spots 
were aired yesterday informing the public about the details. 
  The OCI minister has said the modifications the economic 
advisers made to the government regarding exemptions are being 
incorporated into the latest regulation, while luxury items are 
being taxed more. 
  Ordonez concluded that aside from the free information on 
VAT 
reported by different media, which makes it the more important 
campaign due to its explanatory nature, the official executive 
campaign will cost an estimated 80 million bolivares.

<F P=106> [End of Year speech to the nation by Venezuelan President </F>
Ramon J. Velasquez from the Miraflores Palace Ayacucho Room in 
Caracas--live] 
  [Text] Men and women of Venezuela: The year 1993, which 
is drawing to an end, can be seen in our history as the door to 
a new phase in the nation's life. This is so due to the 
importance of the situations that were resolved in the framework 
of democratic and institutional norms and due to the political, 
economic, and social changes that the transformation crisis made 
evident. 
  These changes, which began building up along the initial 
phases of our democratic life, acquired dramatic urgency when 
national maladjustments resulting from, originally, the foreign 
debt pushed the people to protests in the streets and when new 
political and community organizations appeared; in addition, the 
people made demands due to the continued deterioration of the 
majority's social and economic situation. 
  The ceaseless concentration of wealth and the state's 
inability to handle efficiently health, security, education, and 
housing conditions have also contributed to the situation I 
mentioned. 
  These protests and the charges about corruption and the 
trafficking of influence made daily through the media have 
created in Venezuelans the awareness that they have to 
participate in and watch how the country is doing, an awareness 
the people did not have before. 
  The events of 27 February 1989 are especially significant, 
because they took place before the promulgation and 
implementation of the measures that would modify the state's 
economic policies. The military events of 4 February and 27 
November 1992; the new composition of regional and municipal 
governments as a result of the elections of governors and mayors 
in 1989 and 1992; the unprecedented and most important process 
that culminated with my election as president of the country; 
the new composition of the national and state legislative branch 
that was the result of this December's elections; and the 
election of the new president of the country as a product of an 
alliance of political forces that have broken the traditional 
process that for 35 years had assured two parties the control of 
the state; the government's growing fiscal weakness to promptly 
attend to national problems due to the obligations that the debt 
has created; and increasingly marked social unbalances are all 
undeniable signs of the historic conflict to which I have 
referred. 
  To these factors we must add the growth of the population, 
the states' economic, political, and cultural growth, and the 
autonomy of their governments, as well as the importance of 
organized communities that are out of the control of the 
traditional parties. 
  In Venezuela, the historical gap between the early 1960's 
and the present, which will reach the threshold of the new 
millennium, can be seen clearly now. No sector of the country 
has escaped this commotion. The established order in the 
political system, the military's demands and proposals, and the 
tension and struggle among economic sectors are expressions of 
this cyclical change, which is also present in the fields of 
science and arts, where the great progress that raises the 
country's cultural level makes itself evident. We have strived 
to look for a way out through elections. Although we know that 
elections are not the only solution, it is the most immediate 
instrument that the democratic system places in the hands of all 
Venezuelans to attain peace in this new world to where history 
is leading us. 
  We advanced toward the elections amidst incredulity, 
threats, 
and rumors. In the end, all of the political currents, both 
traditional and those that represent the new participation 
scheme, were present in the elections. It was a multiple 
participation of the political sectors. From the beginning, my 
government announced its main objective: to create the national 
climate and conditions for the elections. We intended to turn 
the elections into the basis for a national rapport of the 
Venezuelan people. We intended for the winning candidate to 
become the standard bearer of national reconciliation, so that 
the hatred that has divided the country lately could be laid 
down, so that the retaliatory spirit that has been marking the 
struggle could be put down, and so that an understanding pact 
reaching every sector could be attained, because the scope of 
the existing social, economic, and fiscal problems underline the 
need for general support so the task of governing Venezuela can 
be performed. 
  Venezuela has elected Dr. Rafael Caldera as the new leader 
of 
the country. He is a fundamental personality in the democratic 
process. To his experience as a statesman he adds the moral 
authority of his life and the broad-mindedness provided by the 
humanistic disciplines. The Supreme Electoral Council performed 
the difficult task of presiding over elections that introduced 
voting methods that proved difficult to understand due to their 
innovative nature, hasty application, and the legislative 
branch's tardiness in disseminating them. I am sure that these 
very difficulties will allay us of the urgent need to finally 
adopt the automatic methods used by the majority of countries at 
present. In this new electoral process, the Armed Forces did 
their duty as usual. This is a task they have been performing 
since 1958 as guarantors of the electoral process and respecters 
of the election results. The Armed Forces have reaffirmed their 
institutional role during these 35 years of democratic life. 
  We will initiate a uniquely dramatic stage due to the urgent 
need to solve problems accumulated over decades. The state's 
present structure cannot bear the weight of these problems or 
the behavior of the country's fundamental sectors whose vision 
appears to have been anchored in a remote time in the past: a 
sparsely populated Venezuela, a debt-free government, and an oil 
revenue whose daily increase solved, or, even better, avoided 
every problem. This was a Venezuela living under a gold bell, 
but this time is over. The various sectors must agree on a 
truce for an understanding for the success of the leaders whom 
the country elected as its legitimate governors on 5 December. 
  The governments' difficulties resulted from, among other 
causes, an economy in transition, dominated by our lacking 
capacity for continuing to produce riches based on the income 
distribution system and on petroleum income, which no longer 
covers our needs nor does it allow us to continue to finance an 
easy lifestyle. 
  Difficulties have also been caused by dissatisfaction, as 
each one has a reason to feel frustrated by a deficient economic 
performance after years of discontinued economic policies, often 
incoherent, whose common denominator, until shortly ago, was 
attempting to perpetuate the system of living off of rent at the 
expense of huge economic distortions and visible inefficiencies. 
Difficulties were caused by pressures from groups, sectors, and 
institutions that aspire to continue to live off state funds. 
Difficulties were caused by the high fiscal deficit due to 
insufficient ordinary income, rigid spending with little 
productivity, and the weakening of petroleum income based on the 
traditional schemes. Difficulties were caused by the profound 
deterioration of the state's structure, of its internal control 
system, and, therefore, of its operational efficiency. 
Difficulties are becoming bigger each day and the effects are 
more harmful each day, as they generate defensive attitudes, 
mistrust, and instability because they harshly strike the 
sectors of lower income. 
  The nation must provide the next government with active and 
permanent support throughout its term to allow it to eliminate 
conflicts by substituting them with agreements, stopping the 
deterioration in the distribution of income, and eliminating the 
dangers of social violence, in a word, so that it can, with 
national support, create a time of strategic consensus in which 
today there is only mixed-up words and confused intentions. 
  The government over which I preside understood that its 
basic 
responsibility was to conclude a constitutional period and guide 
the country to elections, but it also understood its duty of 
guiding the economic transition with responsibility and not 
differing the solution of problems but confronting them to 
prevent the imbalances from growing. 
  We have tried to ensure that the political and economic 
transition over which we are presiding would have the least 
possible impact on Venezuela. Part of this context was the 
government initiative for assuming the responsibility of the 
Special Powers Law; we did this to leave an important 
contribution in the areas of the greatest priority to contribute 
toward setting Venezuela on the path to a healthy economic 
growth. 
  We undertook banking legislation reform, which is necessary 
for strengthening and modernizing the financial system and 
making it more efficient. We undertook reforms to the housing 
policy as well as to the system of the mortgage debtors to 
bolster housing construction for the disadvantaged social groups 
to obtain the most from the resources the state and depositors 
may allocate toward this goal. 
  We took on the responsibility of creating new taxes during 
very difficult election times with the conviction that every 
Venezuelan must contribute to the state expenditures in order 
for us to become permanent fiscal overseers of how Treasury 
funds are used; these are essential for correcting the fiscal 
deficit, and we considered the fact that we will never get rid 
of that deficit by simply cutting the budget or asking for more 
contributions from the petroleum industry. 
  We did it because a chronic fiscal deficit has been feeding 
inflation and will continue to interfere with and threaten 
national stability if proper corrective measures are not taken 
soon. This situation -- a situation stemming from a large 
foreign debt that was supposed to bring about the resources 
necessary for its own amortization -- in practice did not yield 
the expected results, and, instead, it grievously burdened 
public finances. Along with this, we must add the great changes 
that have taken place in the oil market over the past few years 
and the scant political willingness to check our increasing 
public expenditures. We have taken up this task as the first 
step in a new fiscal order because it is urgent to take 
simultaneous action in both public spending and fiscal revenues. 
A sizable portion of the fiscal deficit has been compensated 
for through devaluation, which has become a tax in disguise 
which affects all sectors but weighs more heavily on the lower 
income classes. In addition, this disguised tax has not 
resulted in substantial increases in nontraditional exports as 
originally intended. 
  The government's administrative actions in the essential 
areas of local politics, international relations, economy, 
finances, and other areas will be discussed in detail in the 
speech we will present to Congress this coming January. During 
our government's tenure, we have witnessed a stronger national 
willingness to create the basis for a sincere understanding to 
overcome the difficulties impeding our progress. This certainty 
is the result of countless discussions, consultations, and 
proposals presented to those who represent the most diverse 
local sectors. This is the singular voice of all regions. The 
Catholic Church has been present at all times in the search for 
a way out. Political, entrepreneurial, and labor sectors, and 
universities and citizens agree that today, more than ever, 
there is a willingness to join forces and lay aside rivalries to 
resolve the crisis. 
  Venezuela will indeed resolve its crisis, and 1994 will mark 
the beginning of a recovery by the hand of the new government 
aided by the national determination to cope with problems and 
resolve them positively, fully aware of the new country's 
demands. Venezuela will overcome its crisis because we are 
participants in an unprecedented political transition that has 
proven the validity of our allegiance to democracy. 
  Venezuela will overcome the crisis because its main 
problems have been identified. Some problems are being 
resolved, while others remain in the hands of the government 
that a great many people elected for five years, thereby 
demonstrating their trust. 
  Venezuela will overcome the crisis because it is 
increasingly 
understood that inflation is the worst evil which needs to be 
corrected. This understanding is necessary to take action to 
fight this evil, and this is always difficult. 
  Venezuela will overcome the crisis because it has realized 
that the straightening out of finances is necessary and cannot 
be postponed, and this fact must be faced not only through a 
more efficient and honest administration, but also with income 
generated through taxes. 
  It has been demonstrated that the framework established in 
1992 -- reforms to the organic laws on public credits, the 
budget system, and the Central Bank Law -- is a useful tool that 
is changing the trends in events and is revealing the fact that 
there is a fiscal crisis, that this has harmful effects, that 
essential solutions must be found without a delay in facing 
problems, that requests made to the treasury must be rational, 
and that we must recognize that some demands cannot be met, as 
in the recent past, because the costs of not recognizing this 
would have to be covered by the rest of society by means of 
inflation and high interest rates resulting from fiscal deficits. 
  The crisis will be overcome because the country's leaders 
know it is urgent and necessary to face this difficult social 
situation, because the poverty levels are increasingly high, 
because imbalances in income are becoming intolerable, and 
because of persisting deficiencies in the institutional 
capabilities of the social sector -- that is, the public and 
private organizations that provide essential social services. 
  We are dedicated to making reforms that distribute the costs 
of the adjustments policy. The big differences that exist are 
the main cause of social discontent. 
  The crisis will be overcome because the Venezuelan people 
reject and want to fight the degradation of moral values; 
because the Venezuelan people are prepared to face the challenge 
of modern times; and because the new generations have 
professional scientific, business, and management training and 
know that there have been global changes that demand that we 
understand and participate in the integration process. 
  The crisis will be overcome in order that the Venezuelans, 
thanks to the work and creativeness of all, may again believe in 
the possibility of every new generation living better than the 
previous one and in building a society capable of generating 
enough well-being that will enable it to again be a country with 
hopes. 
  On the threshold of 1994, I wish all the Venezuelan people 
and those who have decided to live in Venezuela the best of 
life. Have a good day. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by Rayma Rondon; from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Defense Minister Vice Admiral Radamez Munoz Leon 
gave assurances that relations between Venezuela and Colombia 
have never been better. He also assured that the relations 
between the Armed Forces of both countries are excellent and 
that the measures Colombia is taking to reinforce Venezuelan 
border surveillance are the best possible. 
  [Begin Munoz recording] Never have relations with Colombia 
been as good as they are now. The relationship between both 
Armed Forces go further than the personal friendship between the 
heads of the Colombian and Venezuelan Armed Forces and this also 
holds true for the defense ministers -- relations are excellent. 
I believe the measures Colombia is taking to support our 
domestic measures is a great demonstration of a broad support 
based on the various international agreements exercised through 
both defense ministers and the various military commanders, both 
Colombian and Venezuelan. The agreements we have are being 
honored. [end recording] 
  Likewise, the defense minister reported that starting 
January 
greater border security efficiency is to be expected. Regarding 
the possibility that civilian and military personnel in the 
Amparo Case [alleged border massacre] may be pardoned, Munoz 
said that the president is studying the case together with other 
cases.

<F P=106> [Report by Adela Leal] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich has 
downplayed reports that members of the Venezuelan military are 
smuggling weapons to the Colombian guerrillas, saying that 
cross-border gun running is nothing new. 
  Ochoa Antich said: The truth is that gun running to Colombia 
has always occurred. On a number of occasions Colombia has 
informed Venezuela of the problem, and we have investigated and 
taken disciplinary action within the FAN [National Armed Forces] 
to prevent such practices. 
  In reply to a question asked during a year-end toast at 
Miraflores Palace, the foreign minister said, "The amount of 
money Colombian guerrillas sometimes offer for Venezuelan 
weapons is so high that it tempts military or police personnel, 
but the truth is that the quantities of arms sold are very 
small." 
  Ochoa Antich added: One cannot say there exists massive arms 
smuggling from Venezuela to Colombia. Instead, there are small 
sales because of a lack of control. In no way, however, does 
this influence the military situation in Colombia. 
  Meanwhile, the foreign minister expressed satisfaction over 
the Colombian Government's decision to support antiguerrilla 
measures endorsed by Venezuela. Ochoa Antich said: This is what 
we have constantly asked from the Colombian Government -- that 
it take appropriate actions to ensure that attacks from its 
national territory against Venezuelan territory are not 
encouraged. 
  Ochoa Antich also disputed information coming from Santa Fe 
de Bogota that says a force of 20,000 Venezuelan soldiers has 
been deployed along the border. Ochoa Antich said: According to 
what the defense minister told me, normal border reinforcement 
movements are under way because of security problems in the 
area. Anyway, in our territory we can carry out whatever 
movements we deem necessary without taking into account any 
other country.

  [Text] Mexico City, 1 Jan (AFP) -- According to several 
sources, a group of Indians rose up in arms today and seized by 
force the mayor's office in San Cristobal de las Casas in the 
southern state of Chiapas. 
  In a communique, the rebels announced the creation of a 
guerrilla group called the Zapata National Liberation Army 
[Ejercito Zapatista de Liberacion Nacional -- EZLN]. The 
communique calls on EZLN forces "to advance toward the capital 
of the country, defeat the Mexican Federal Army, protect the 
civilian population during this liberating advance, and allow 
the liberated people to elect their own administrative 
authorities in a free and democratic manner." 
  Eyewitness Ernesto Riedwyl told AFP that in San Cristobal de 
las Casas some 200-300 people took over the municipal palace. 
According to Riedwyl, these people are now engaged in 
destroying and looting the building. Riedwyl said: "They are 
all wearing uniforms with green trousers, brown shirts, and red 
hats and scarfs. They are also carrying weapons of various 
calibers, and they have modern radio communications equipment." 
  He added, "Most of them are Indians, but there are also some 
white people with light-colored eyes." 
  According to this witness, the rebellion began at 0230 (0830 
GMT) when the rebels took over the Justice Palace, which they 
burned. Later, they took over the San Cristobal de las Casas 
Mayor's Office. According to Radio Red, the rebels are also 
causing "disturbances" in other areas of Chiapas State, which 
borders Guatemala. 
  According to reporters, security forces in Chiapas have 
tried 
to persuade the rebels to resolve their problems through legal 
means, but this report has not been officially confirmed.

  [Text] Mexico City, Jan 1 (AFP) -- An unexpected 
"declaration of war" accompanied by the violent takeover of 
three or four municipal offices was launched this Saturday by 
the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN) [Ejercito Zapatista 
de Liberacion Nacional] in the southern state of Chiapas, which 
borders on Guatemala and is one of the poorest states in Mexico. 
  The members of the previously unknown EZLN emphasized in 
their proclamation, which was distributed among residents and 
posted on the walls of buildings and the occupied 
municipalities, that "we are aware that the war we have declared 
is a last resort, but it is a just one." 
  In the proclamation, which was distributed in San Cristobal 
de las Casas, where the rebels seized the municipal palace, the 
EZLN asserted that "the dictators have been executing an 
undeclared, genocidal war against our people for many years. 
That is why we are asking for your determined participation and 
support for this decision of the Mexican people, who struggle 
for labor, land, roofs, food, health, education, independence, 
freedom, democracy, justice, and peace." 
  "We declare that we will not stop fighting until we attain 
these basic demands for our people by forming a government for 
our free and democratic country," the proclamation highlighted. 
  The information on guerrilla actions in Chiapas, 
approximately 700 km south of Mexico City, is confusing. There 
are no details on the number of EZLN rebels participating in the 
actions, on the results of the takeover of municipal officers, 
or on any possible victims. It is known, however, that there 
have not been any confrontations between the rebels and the Army. 
  The Zapatistas -- taken from the name of Emiliano Zapata, 
one 
of the most important heroes of the 1910 Mexican Revolution -- 
stated: "We are the product of 500 years of struggle;" we are 
men "who have not been allowed to have the most elementary 
training so we can be used as cannon fodder and so they can 
plunder the wealth of our fatherland without caring whether we 
starve to death." 
  "But today we say: Enough! We are the heirs of the 
forefathers of our nation. We, the dispossessed, number in the 
millions, and we call on our brothers to join us as the only way 
to avoid starving to death due to the insatiable ambitions of a 
dictatorship that has lasted more than 70 years, headed by a 
clique of traitors who represent the most conservative and 
turncoat groups." 
  This is the first time in almost 20 years that an uprising 
by 
a Mexican guerrilla group has been publicly known. However, a 
few months ago there was information that rebel training camps 
were being established in Chiapas. 
  The EZLN "War Declaration" states the following six points: 
  1) Advance toward the country's capital city, defeating the 
Mexican Federal Army, and allowing liberated people to freely 
and democratically elect their authorities. 
  2) Respect the life of prisoners and hand over the injured 
ones to the International Red Cross. 
  3) Initiate summary trials against Mexican Federal Army 
soldiers and political police who have taken courses in foreign 
countries on "charges of treason to the fatherland." 
  4) Form new ranks with all Mexicans who manifest their 
desire 
to join our just struggle, "including those who, being enemy 
soldiers, surrender without fighting our forces." 
  5) Ask for the unconditional surrender of the enemy 
headquarters prior to combat. 
  6) Suspend the looting of our natural resources in areas 
controlled by the EZLN. 
  The ideological affiliation of the Zapatistas, as well as 
their real force, is still unknown. However, it is said they 
are mostly Indians, although an eyewitness told AFP that there 
are some men with fair skin and light eyes.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 1 Jan (AFP) -- 
"We have taken up arms because we are fed up" because "we have 
been oppressed for many years and our problems have not been 
solved," the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN) stated this 
Saturday after issuing "a declaration of war" against the 
Mexican Army and Government. 
  At a news conference held in San Cristobal de las Casas, the 
EZLN's Zone Clandestine Committee [Comite Clandestino de Zona -- 
CCZ] disclosed that the takeover of five mayoralties in Chiapas 
State in southern Mexico today responds to "the people's needs. 
They are dying of hunger, and that is why they are up in arms." 
  In broken Spanish, three alleged Indians of the EZLN 
explained that their armed movement, which stunned Mexico on the 
first day of 1994, "is a just struggle, not something crazy." 
  The spokesmen for the guerrilla group said: "We will not end 
this struggle until we attain our goal and our demands are met; 
that is, improvements for the people so they will have no more 
needs." 
  The group maintains that the government does not solve their 
problems and that the rich hoard the land, while the Indians of 
Chiapas -- one of Mexico's poorest, most backward states -- lack 
food, health, and education." 
  They said that their armed movement, the first to appear in 
almost two decades in this country, "was created so the Indian 
people will have the opportunity to choose their government. 
The people have had enough of electoral fraud. According to 
the government, we have a democracy, but that is a lie. The 
people are on a war footing." 
  An undetermined number of EZLN members partially seized the 
mayoralties in San Cristobal, Ocosingo, Altamirano, Las 
Margaritas, and Chanal this Saturday. According to provisional 
unofficial reports, there are three dead and 18 wounded. 
  The CCZ members stressed that "we have not come to this city 
(San Cristobal) to make threats. We respect the people. The 
Army is the enemy; it is rank and file of the capitalists. We 
know very well how members of the Army, the public security 
forces, and the judiciary have been acting against the peasants, 
teachers, and students who have been repressed with torture and 
death and who have been made political prisoners." 
  In its first communique, disseminated by the guerrillas in 
the towns they occupied, the EZLN ordered its forces to advance 
to the capital, approximately 700 km north, and defeat the armed 
forces. 
  At the news conference, the guerrillas said that in the 
event 
that the Army intervenes to suppress their armed uprising, "the 
Indians have prepared themselves for the war because we know it 
is for freedom, justice, and democracy." 
  Chiapas State authorities ordered the public security forces 
to avoid confrontations with the guerrillas. Meanwhile, the 
Armed Forces are on the lookout and have limited themselves to 
remaining approximately 20 km from downtown San Cristobal and to 
flying over the city with helicopters and planes. 
  The situation in Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, Altamirano, and 
Chanal is unknown due to a lack of information from official 
sources and from the rebels themselves. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 0104 GMT transmits a report which 
adds: "The Government and National Defense Secretariats, as well 
as the Presidency, have not made any comments on the EZLN armed 
action."]

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, 2 Jan (AFP) -- An official 
communique issued today said the government of the Mexican State 
of Chiapas "has insisted unsuccessfully on its proposal to hold 
a dialogue" with the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN), 
which took by storm the mayor's offices in five municipalities. 
  The communique emphasized that the authorities have 
requested 
the EZLN members, who issued a "Declaration of War" against the 
Army and the Mexican Government on Saturday, to "put aside their 
violent and belligerent position against the civilian population 
and the municipal authorities." 
  A day after the sudden attack by several hundred guerrillas 
on the Chiapas municipalities of San Cristobal de las Casas, 
Ocosingo, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and Chanal, the government 
said, it is "concerned about the prevailing atmosphere in the 
municipal county seats," which remained occupied by the EZLN. 
  At first, authorities indicated that the wave of violence 
had 
been unleashed by 200 Indian peasants, but their most recent 
communique claims that the peasant groups "are infiltrated by 
people with obvious paramilitary training." The communique 
added that the infiltrators have "high-powered weapons, wear 
green pants, khaki shirts, and red and black badges, and present 
themselves as an organization of presumed liberation forces." 
  The communique pointed out that residents of the occupied 
municipalities "have said that some Catholic priests and deacons 
who uphold liberation theology have become involved with these 
groups and are supporting them with the radio communications 
system of the San Cristobal Diocese." 
  It noted: "The so-called Emiliano Zapata organization is 
linked to the Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union 
Party and to the Poor People's Party (guerrillas), and it has 
forced the Ocisingo radio station to broadcast harangues calling 
for violence." 
  The government's communique pointed out that Felipe Arriaga, 
the bishop of Tuxtla Gutierrez, "has urged these groups to put 
aside their violent position and regretted that priests and 
deacons are accused of involvement in these incidents." 
  In Mexico City, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential 
candidate of the center-leftist Party of the Democratic 
Revolution, said in a news release that "violence, whatever its 
origin, only leads to bloodshed, destruction, and greater social 
backwardness," adding that the government's duty is to inform 
people about the true situation in Chiapas. 
  According to NOTIMEX -- the official news agency -- 
Government Under Secretary Ricardo Garcia said the Mexican 
Government is urging peasants in Chiapas to be reasonable and to 
try to resolve their problems within a legal framework.

  [Text] The most important event featured today in Mexico 
City's newspapers is the following: An armed group, mostly 
Indians, the self-styled Zapata National Liberation Army [EZLN] 
-- linked with the Procup [Revolutionary Workers Clandestine 
People's Union Party] and the Poor People's Party, according to 
state officials -- violently seized on the morning of 1 January 
the municipal offices in San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, 
Altamirano, Chanal, and Las Margaritas, with a toll of at least 
11 dead and dozens of injured -- three in clashes sustained with 
public forces -- according to unofficial sources. 
  According reports from state officials, the Indians -- 
according to witnesses, there were about 2,200 of them -- were 
armed with AR-15 rifles, .22 caliber rifles, and shotguns, and 
they simultaneously stormed the five municipalities. Given the 
situation, the government secretariat warned it cannot justify 
the fact that fair social demands, for which there exists a 
willingness to provide a solution, be used as a pretext to 
violate legal order. 
  A Government Ministry communique said the government is 
urging these groups to act wisely, recant, and establish 
negotiations within a legal framework. Meanwhile, state 
officials called these actions a violent provocation. They also 
ordered public security forces to dissuade the armed groups, 
making it possible to seek a solution to their demands, which 
have yet to be stated, through dialogue and legal means. 
  Given the situation, the bishops of Chiapas State issued an 
appeal to the EZLN forces to accept the bishops' mediation in an 
effort to restore harmony and social tranquility in the 
municipalities involved in the conflict. Furthermore, it is 
appropriate to mention that contacts are being maintained 
between federal government officials and state officials in an 
effort to quickly resolve the situation. 
  The declaration of war issued by the Sandinist National 
Liberation Army, excuse me, the EZLN, to the Mexican Federal 
Army asks the nation's legislative and judicial branches to 
strive to restore the nation's legality and stability. The EZLN 
is asking international organizations and the International Red 
Cross to supervise and regulate the clashes that its forces are 
waging to protect the civilian population. 
  The declaration of war rejects any links to drug 
traffickers, 
narcoguerrillas, or any other groups when referring to the 
struggle waged by the EZLN, which has ordered its military 
forces to advance toward the country's capital, defeat the 
Mexican Federal Army, and allow the liberated people to 
democratically elect their own administrative authorities. 
  This is, in short, what is currently taking place in five 
municipalities in Chiapas State -- San Cristobal de las Casas, 
Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal, and Las Margaritas -- where the 
self- proclaimed EZLN violently seized the municipal offices and 
where there is a toll of 11 dead and dozens wounded. 
  A report issued early this morning by NOTIMEX reports that, 
after stating the need to contribute their efforts to prevent a 
possible confrontation involving the people of Chiapas, the 
bishops of Chiapas agreed to take part as mediators to restore 
harmony and peace in the municipalities involved in the conflict. 
  A communique issued by the diocese of Tuxtla Gutierrez and 
Tapachula, Chiapas State, stated that, in an effort to create 
conditions that will allow a fruitful dialogue, we issue an 
appeal to the so-called EZLN, urging it to accept four points. 
The bishops request an end to violence, respect for people's 
lives, the release of kidnapped people, and they urge them to 
put down their weapons, respect the law and human rights, and to 
take part in a dialogue to resolve social problems. 
  The bishops' document mentions that, in the event that their 
proposal is accepted, within the next 48 hours the bishops 
promise to ask the government to establish an office to handle 
social problems in the region. The bishops said they have been 
trying to contact the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, 
Samuel Ruiz Garcia, since early this morning. Their efforts 
have failed so far, but they add they can count on the 
solidarity of this diocese's pastor. 
  The bishops of Chiapas note that their agreement to serve as 
mediators was prompted by requests they received from different 
social groups in Chiapas to search for a solution to the 
problems that have arisen in San Cristobal de las Casas, 
Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, and Altamirano.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 2 Jan (AFP) -- 
Members of the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN) remain in 
the towns of Ocosingo, and they apparently also remain in the 
towns of Altamirano, Chanal, and Las Margaritas, after suddenly 
leaving San Cristobal de las Casas, it was reported on Sunday by 
media sources. 
  The guerrilla members, it was confirmed by TIEMPO newspaper 
in San Cristobal, burned the municipal palace in Ocosingo early 
this morning and continued to hold their positions in the town 
as of 0730 (1330 GMT). 
  The San Cristobal Municipal Police said the EZLN members 
left 
the city, the second most important one in the Mexican state of 
Chiapas, and painted graffiti on the wall to announce they were 
en route to the town of Rancho Nuevo. A local journalist, 
however, noted that the announcement was actually "black humor," 
because the 31st Military Zone is located in Rancho Nuevo and 
the guerrilla members "will not walk into the wolf's lair." 
  The EZLN members' graffiti indicated they will continue 
along 
their way "to Tuxtla Gutierrez (capital of Chiapas) and there 
will be no rest." Other graffiti read: "We do not want NAFTA. 
We want freedom and a legitimate government." 
  The authorities have yet to issue a report on the situation 
which prevails in Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, Chanal, and 
Altamirano, or to indicate if troops are pursuing the guerrilla 
forces which left San Cristobal and whose whereabouts are 
unknown. 
  According to different reports, the toll of the EZLN's 
arrival is six dead -- three in Ocosingo and three in Las 
Margaritas. 
  Chiapas, on the Guatemalan border, is located 700 km south 
of 
Mexico City, and it is one of the most backward and poorest 
states in the country and has a predominantly Indian population.

<F P=106> [Interview with `Commander' Marcos, leader of the Indios </F>
rebellion in Mexico, by "Gi. Pr." in San Cristobal; date not 
given: "`It is Better To Die Fighting Rather Than Die of 
Dysentery'" -- first paragraph is L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] San Cristobal -- He was one of the few with his 
face covered and armed with a machine gun. He was the only 
non-Indios. As he spoke, he took a pipe out of his pocket and 
slipped it into the opening of his balaclava. He expressed 
himself clearly as an intellectual would when speaking to simple 
people. He is definitely Mexican but his accent was 
unrecognizable. A Japanese-eyed girl wearing a black balaclava 
stood by his side during the entire interview. 
  [L'UNITA] Commander Marcos, you captured San Cristobal on 1 
January. But who are you? 
  [Marcos] We are part of the Zapatist Liberation Army [name 
as published] and we demand the resignation of the federal 
government and the formation of a new transitional government 
that will set August 1994 as the date for free and democratic 
elections. We demand that the principal requests of the 
peasants from Chiapas for bread, health, education, autonomy, 
and peace, be resolved. The Indios have always been at war 
because up to now the war was always waged against them, but now 
it will be war for the Indios and the whites. In any case, they 
will have the opportunity of dying fighting rather than of 
diarrhea, the way the Indios from Chiapas normally die. 
  [L'UNITA] Have you any relations with peasant political 
organizations? 
  [Marcos] We have no relations with any type of open 
organization, our organization is solely an armed and 
clandestine organization. 
  [L'UNITA] Have you sprung up out of nowhere, all of a 
sudden? 
  [Marcos] We have been preparing ourselves in the mountains 
for 10 years now. This movement is not improvised. We have 
been maturing, thinking, learning, and we have reached this 
decision. 
  [L'UNITA] Do your requests have a racial, ethnic 
connotation? 
  [Marcos] The managing committee is made up of Tzotil, 
Tzetal, Chol, Tojolabal, Mam, and Zoque Indios, the principal 
ethnic groups in Chiapas. They all meet and in addition to 
asking for democracy and representation, they ask for respect, 
the respect that the whites have never given them. Primarily 
here in San Cristobal, the whites [coletos] are very insulting 
and discriminatory toward the Indios in everyday life. Now the 
whites respect the Indios because they see them with weapons in 
their hands. 
  [L'UNITA] What do you think the government's reaction will 
be now? 
  [Marcos] The government's response does not worry us to the 
same extent that the response of the people, the Mexicans, does. 
We are interested in knowing what example this occurrence will 
produce, what effect it will have on the nation's conscience. 
We hope that something will happen, not only in terms of an 
armed battle, but in every sense. We hope that this masked 
dictatorship will end. 
  [L'UNITA] Do you not put your trust in the PRD [Democratic 
Revolutionary Party] as an opposition party in the forthcoming 
elections? 
  [Marcos] It is not so much in the political parties that we 
have no faith as in the electoral system. The Salinas de 
Gortari government is an illegitimate government, the result of 
fraud, and this illegitimate government can only give rise to 
illegitimate elections. We want a transitional government that 
will call new elections but with a contest that is really fair 
and equal, offering the same conditions to all the political 
parties. In Chiapas 15,000 Indios die each year from diseases 
that can be cured. This figure is similar to that caused by the 
war in Salvador. Here, if a farmer with cholera goes to a field 
hospital, they send him away to prevent people saying that there 
is cholera in Chiapas. In this movement the Indios that are 
part of the Zapatista army want to have talks with their own 
people primarily. They are are the real interlocutors. 
  [L'UNITA] Excuse me, but you are not an Indios. 
  [Marcos] You must understand that our movement is not a 
local Chiapas movement, but a movement that embraces the whole 
country. So are the people, who come from other states, as I do. 
There a people from Chiapas fighting in other places. We are 
Mexicans and that is what unites us, together with our demand 
for liberty and democracy. We want to elect our real 
representatives. 
  [L'UNITA] But do you not fear strong repression now? 
  [Marcos] American Indians have been the vitims for 
repression for 500 years. Perhaps you refer to the sort of 
repression typical of South American regimes. Well, this South 
American style of repression is the Indios' daily bread. Ask 
the Indios living on the outskirts of San Cristobal. 
  [L'UNITA] What development would you consider successful? 
  [Marcos] We would like other movements from all over the 
republic to join ours. 
  [L'UNITA] Must they be armed? 
  [Marcos] No, we are making a broad appeal: We are also 
addressing people from civil, legal, open movements. 
  [L'UNITA] Why have you chosen 1 January and the city of San 
Cristobal de Las Casas? 
  [Marcos] The managing committee made that decision. It is 
clear that the date coincides with the TLC (free trade treaty), 
which is a death sentence for the Indios. The coming into force 
of the treaty represents the start of internationalized 
destruction. 
  [L'UNITA] What do you think reaction abroad will be? Are 
you not afraid that the United States may intervene as it has 
done in other parts of Latin America? 
  [Marcos] Previously the United States used the excuse of the 
Soviet Union; it feared Soviet infiltration in our country. But 
now, what can it think of a movement that is only asking for 
social justice? It can no longer think that we are being 
manipulated by foreigners or that Moscow is funding us, since 
Moscow does not exist any more: Ask Yeltsin. The Americans 
must realize that we are fighting for what everybody wants, for 
what the Europeans themselves wanted. Didn't the people in 
Germany and Italy rebel against dictatorship? Is it therefore 
unreasonable for the Mexican people to rebel as well? The North 
Americans are much to blame for the situation that you can see, 
the state of poverty of the Indios and their great hunger for 
justice. The entire social system in Mexico is based on 
injustice toward the Indios. The worst thing that can happen to 
a human being is to be an Indios, with the heavy load of 
humiliation, hunger, and poverty that he must bear.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by Radio ACIR reporter Maricarmen Camacho </F>
from Tuxtla Gutierrez and reporter Jaime Alejo in the Radio ACIR 
studios in Mexico City] 
  [Text] [Camacho] From the early hours of this morning, the 
members of the Zapata Army of National Liberation [EZLN] -- who 
are still occupying Ocosingo, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and 
part of San Cristobal -- unexpectedly withdrew from the main 
square of San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  We talked to local columnist Jorge Paniagua Herrera on the 
phone, and he told us that the main square was empty and 
everything seemed to have returned to normal in San Cristobal. 
However, it is being suspected that EZLN members might be 
preparing to attack other municipalities. Last night, there 
were rumors that they might attack the city of Palenque at 
midnight. We have not received any reports on this yet, and 
everything seems to be calm. 
  Here in Tuxtla Gutierrez, we are seeing some Air Force 
planes 
flying over, and some ambulances as well. There have been 
rumors that seven people have been killed, but we have not 
received any official reports. What is true is that EZLN 
members murdered the commander of the Ocosingo Judicial Police 
yesterday. Another three people were stripped and tied up. 
  In Ocosingo municipality, which is the largest in Chiapas 
and 
is close to the Lacandon jungle, the peasants -- including some 
Guatemalans -- are still occupying the installations of the 
state government's radio station. This radio station has a 
strong signal in the jungle area, and the peasants are using it 
to broadcast their ideas. It was reported in Ocosingo that the 
peasants have withdrawn from the square but still remain at some 
radio station. 
  Eyewitnesses mentioned that the runway was set on fire to 
prevent airplanes from landing. Early this morning some shops 
in San Cristobal were robbed. The situation in the municipal 
county seats of Margaritas and Trinitarias remains unchanged: 
EZLN members are still in the area. We talked to some people 
in the cities of San Cristobal and Ocosingo, where we have only 
been able to get through by telephone because the roads were 
blocked until the early hours of the morning. People are very 
afraid, and they are desperately asking for the government's 
intervention. According to an official communique, the 
government is trying to prevent a bloodshed in those 
municipalities. Do you have any doubts, questions? 
  [Alejo] Is there any information on the identity of the EZLN 
leaders? 
  [Camacho] We have not been able to identify any of the faces 
that were shown on television. However, it is obvious that the 
group includes Guatemalans. Precisely yesterday, we were able 
to watch some recordings from Ocosingo, where they were talking 
on the radio, and it is obvious that the leaders are not 
peasants, but rather well-educated people. Their speeches are 
too well-written. Many people believe there are Guatemalans 
among the leaders because of the accent among other things. 
Some of them have tried to cover their faces with stockings to 
remain anonymous. 
  The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas also has been 
accused of being involved in these incidents, but so far there 
is no evidence of this. What is true and evident is that there 
are Guatemalans involved. It is evident because of the accent; 
we are very familiar with the accents, and we know how the 
Indians speak. People I have talked to in Ocosingo have said 
that there are people with features different from ours. 
  [Alejo] Maricarmen, it has also been said that most members 
of the armed group are Indians and peasants? 
  [Camacho] There are peasants from Chiapas, but not Indians, 
because EZLN members do not speak any dialects. EZLN members 
include mestizos rather than Indians. There are even youths 
between the ages of 13 and 18 who are armed, as well as women. 
Some of the women have been identified as being from the 
Lacandon area, but they are not necessarily Indians.

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, 2 Jan (EFE) -- Members of 
the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN) today freed some 120 
inmates from the prison of San Cristobal de las Casas in 
Chiberos, where the rebels have clashed with military forces. 
  The San Cristobal prison has practically become the line of 
combat between an as of yet undetermined number of EZLN members 
and the forces of the Mexican Army, anonymous sources told EFE. 
  Most of the freed inmates are reportedly Indians, according 
to the sources. The EZLN is made up primarily of Indians of the 
Tzeltales, Tzotziles, and Tojolabales tribes. 
  The sources also reported that the town of Ocosingo 
northwest 
of San Cristobal has been virtually cut off after EZLN members 
blew up the bridges of La Florida and La Virgen at the entrance 
and exit of Ocosingo. 
  It was also reported that the San Cristobal de las Casas Red 
Cross ordered the suspension of its services given the lack of 
guarantees for its workers. 
  At least 14 guerrillas have died and some six soldiers and 
three civilians were injured, two of whom are Red Cross members 
who were injured when the ambulance in which they were traveling 
was fired upon.

City on 2 January; from an XEW "Special Report" -- read by

  [Text] In light of the events of 30 December 1993 in the 
town of San Miguel, followed by the events that took place in 
the predawn hours of 1 January 1994 in which groups of outlaws 
occupied Ocosingo, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and San Cristobal 
de las Casas in Chiapas State, all military personnel assigned 
to the 7th Military Region were ordered to remain in their 
barracks. They were to await the results of possible talks led 
by the state government directed at getting the members of the 
offensive armed groups to return to lawfulness. At 0700 [1300 
GMT] today, after leaving San Cristobal, unidentified troops 
surrounded and attacked the military camp housing the 
headquarters of the 31st Military Zone located approximately 10 
km southeast of the aforementioned town. At 1330 [1930 GMT] the 
attacks by said armed groups against the military camp continue. 
The Federal Attorney General delegate was summoned and ordered 
to file a report on the events as soon as possible.

  [Text] Regarding Bulletin No. 1 issued on this date by 
this section of the executive branch, and as shooting continues 
in the vicinity of the military camp housing the headquarters of

government troops found 41 backpacks containing materiel and the 
personal belongings of an equal number of attackers. Included 
in these items were 17 military backpacks, 30 firearms, two 
two-way radios, several knives, and two smoke grenades. 
Reinforcement troops moving in from Palenque were attacked in 
Ocosingo, where fighting continues. It is not known if there 
are any casualties among the attackers. One soldier was killed

<F P=106> [Bulletin issued by the Government Secretariat in Mexico </F>
City on 2 January; from an XEW "Special Report" -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] Today the armed group that had occupied various 
municipalities in the region of Ocosingo in Chiapas abandoned 
the city of San Cristobal de las Casas. The situation is 
returning to normal in that city under the protection of the 
Army. 
  Meanwhile, during its withdrawal, the attacking group has 
clashed with soldiers and harassed other towns, causing loss of 
human life and diverse damage. As of this afternoon, the 
attitude of the federal government and a balance of the events 
that have taken place in the first two days of the year in the 
Ocosingo region, Chiapas, can be summarized as follows: 
  On 1 January the federal government decided to place 
priority 
on the protection of human lives. That is why the Army did not 
act when the attacking armed group occupied the city of San 
Cristobal de las Casas. Not only did the security forces 
refrain from acting, but the government made numerous calls for 
dialogue and a search for peaceful solutions to the situation 
created by the armed group. 
  Both the federal government and Chiapas regional and 
municipal authorities have reiterated their willingness to hold 
a political dialogue with all organizations and representations 
of civilian society to normalize the situation in the region. 
  During the second day of disturbances today, after the 
attackers left San Cristobal de las Casas, the federal 
government ordered, on the one hand, that the National Defense 
Secretariat take measures to defend its installations, and on 
the other hand, at the request of social groups of the different 
municipalities of the region and municipal and state 
authorities, that the National Defense Secretariat itself 
reinforce protection and security of towns in the area to 
prevent possible new attacks by the armed group. 
  In the takeover of the cities of Ocosingo, Altamirano, 
Abasolo, Chanal del Carmen, Las Margaritas, and San Cristobal de 
las Casas, the attackers killed 27 people, 24 of whom were local 
policemen, and three civilians. Meanwhile, during clashes 
between the armed group and the Army, six soldiers and 24 
attackers were killed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ricardo Garcia Villalobos, undersecretary of </F>
government, at the Government Secretariat by unidentified 
reporter on 2 January; place not given; from an XEW "Special 
Report" -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Would you give us a rundown on the 
incidents in Chiapas State over the past 2 days? 
  [Villalobos] Yesterday, 1 January, the Government 
Secretariat 
issued a news bulletin. I would like to quote parts of that 
bulletin. Throughout 1 January the Mexican Army and Police 
refrained from taking any action whatsoever despite the fact 
that an armed group had taken over several cities in the area of 
Ocosingo, Chiapas. This armed group is endangering the lives of 
the residents of these communities, and consequently the state 
and municipal authorities issue a call for order to be 
reestablished, for the members of the group to desist, and for a 
dialogue to be held to find a solution to this situation that is 
painful for all Mexicans. 
  Today, which is the second day of the incident, the armed 
group left the town of San Cristobal de las Casas. The group 
then carried out an act of aggression by heading toward a 
military installation and engaging in a clash with the Mexican 
Army. The military authorities already have reported on this 
incident. The authorities and the residents themselves of the 
town of San Cristobal de las Casas and its environs would like 
this armed group to cease its activities and participate in a 
dialogue with the authorities. There is a broad offer from all 
three levels of government -- municipal, state, and federal -- 
for the lines of communication to be opened to respond to the 
specific demands that the group has been making. 
  On earlier occasions talks have been held with groups from 
this area. Important steps were taken in August regarding a 
number of requests that were made quite some time ago, and we 
believe that substantial progress has been made in the area over 
the past five years. Nonetheless, the invitation stands for 
communication to begin with authorities at any of the three 
levels of government. This is a request from the people of 
Chiapas, and the municipal, state, and federal authorities are 
heeding this request with great interest. 
  [Reporter] In the past few hours there was an exchange of 
gunfire between the two parties. How many casualties have been 
registered so far? 
  [Villalobos] Several casualty counts have been provided over 
the past two days. I would like to refer to some of them. So 
far 26 policemen and civilians have been killed; one Red Cross 
volunteer was tortured and killed; 24 civilians were injured; 
and one woman was raped. Regarding the clash you mention, which 
I presume is the clash with the Mexican Army in the area of 
Rancho Nuevo, the Army itself has already reported that five 
soldiers were killed and six were wounded. The bodies of 24 
rebels were found, as well as a large amount of materiel that 
the rebels had abandoned. Among the abandoned materiel there 
are weapons of the type used by the armies of several countries, 
as well as non-military-issue firearms, knives, and other 
articles such as two tear gas grenades. This is the result of 
two days of actions in that area. 
  [Reporter] What message can the federal government give to 
the residents of Chiapas at this difficult time? 
  [Villalobos] This is an unusual situation, of course, so I 
believe the people of Chiapas know that they should remain calm. 
Civilian organizations as well as the municipal authorities have 
asked for more direct action by the Mexican Army to prevent 
other possible clashes. Consequently, the people should remain 
calm and follow any instructions given to protect them. We hope 
that this situation will be resolved shortly. 
  [Reporter] Would you like to add anything more, sir? 
  [Villalobos] I would like to ask those who have been 
carrying 
out these unusual actions to cease and desist.

  [Text] Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], condemned today's 
events in four municipalities of Chiapas State, where members of 
the so-called Zapata National Liberation Army [EZLN] have staged 
violent clashes. The PRI candidate said there is nothing to 
justify jeopardizing the lives of the inhabitants of these 
municipalities or threatening their peaceful coexistence. Luis 
Donaldo Colosio issued a press bulletin saying he was convinced 
that violence is not the way to solve poverty. 
  The Confederation of Labor Organizations condemned Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz and his close supporters as well as the armed groups 
for having acted irresponsibly during the last few days in 
Chiapas. The organization says that the church has been the 
main player in many of the confrontations between the Indian 
community and the government, thus endangering human lives. 
According to a document issued in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the three 
Chiapas bishops reaffirmed their willingness to serve as 
mediators in the conflict between the EZLN and the authorities. 
In the first point of a communique, the three bishops of 
Chiapas State, Felipe Aguirre Franco, Felipe Arizmendi Esqivel, 
and Samuel Ruiz Garcia, offer their mediation based on the 
church's moral recognition in the region.

  [Text] Mexico City, 2 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican Army 
reported this Sunday that an unspecified armed group attacked a 
military garrison near the southeastern city of San Cristobal de 
las Casas after armed Indians occupied that town on Saturday. 
  The group sieged and assaulted the garrison of the 31st 
Military Zone, 10 km north of San Cristobal de las Casas, 
Chiapas, and according to the National Defense Secretariat, the 
attack lasted into the afternoon. 
  In the predawn hours of Saturday, armed Indians of the 
self-styled Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN), which was 
previously unknown, forcefully seized the towns of San Cristobal 
de las Casas, Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, and Altamirano in that 
region. 
  Official reports indicated that the Indians had left San 
Cristobal de las Casas early on Sunday without clashing with the 
Mexican Army. 
  The occupation of the four towns left a toll of three dead 
and some 14 injured. The Army communique did not report 
casualties on the attack against the military zone. 
  The same communique reported that the Army expected "a 
possible dialogue" with the local government of Chiapas -- a 
Mexican state bordering Guatemala -- to see that the "attacking 
groups" cease their illegal actions and resort only to lawful 
means.

  [Excerpt] Mexico City, 3 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- [passage omitted] 
A group identified with the Zapata National Liberation Army 
[EZLN] kidnapped former Chiapas State Governor Absalon 
Castellanos Dominguez in Comitan near the Guatemalan border, 
according to a report received on Sunday night [3 Jan]. 
  Some 40 armed men captured the former state governor along 
with his brother and his wife, said a niece of Castellanos 
Dominguez, a retired major general who governed Chiapas State 
from 1982 to 1988. 
  Castellanos Dominguez also served as regional commander of 
the Mexican Army and director of the Military Academy in the 
Mexican capital.

  [Excerpts] The civilian population in San Cristobal de las 
Casas, Ocosingo, Abasolo, Chanal del Carmen, and Las Margaritas 
face an uncertain situation, fearing new surprise attacks by the 
so-called Zapata National Liberation Army, which has declared a 
war on the Mexican Army. 
  There are scenes of destruction and death today. Members of 
the armed group are warning they will not remain entrenched. 
They intend to advance to the central part of the state and the 
country to demand the formation of what they call a free and 
democratic government. 
  The most recent offensive launched by the armed group 
resulted in the kidnapping of former Chiapas Governor General 
Absalon Castellanos. Approximately 40 heavily armed men arrived 
at his ranch in Margaritas municipality. There is still no clue 
as to the whereabouts of Absalon Castellanos. 
  Today, the Mexican Army controls the city of San Cristobal 
de 
las Casas, which was suddenly abandoned by the rebels who tried 
to storm the 31st Military Zone's general headquarters. 
However, the action was successfully repelled by the Mexican 
Army. 
  Clashes between the two sides in two days have left 57 dead. 
The Red Cross has decided not to go into areas of conflict 
given the lack of security for its humanitarian work. This 
follows attacks on two Red Cross ambulances in San Cristobal de 
las Casas, where a rescue team member was killed. The Red Cross 
is warning it lacks medicine and the necessary material to 
handle the emergency. [passage omitted] 
  The Judicial Police and the General Secretariat of 
Protection 
and Highways in Mexico City have launched a special security 
operation which includes heightened security at government 
facilities, media installations, and embassies. This is being 
done as a precautionary measure to prevent any surprise takeover.

  [Text] There could be cabinet changes, Peruvian President 
Alberto Fujimori has hinted by failing to discard this 
possibility after promulgating Peru's new Constitution. 
  [Begin recording] [Fujimori] We have concluded a first 
phase. 
There is stability; inflation is well under control, and we have 
access to international credits, and conditions have been 
created--it is not that broad exonerations have been granted--so 
that certain sectors may contribute to vitalizing the economy. 
  In 1994, we are going to give priority attention to 
reactivating the economy. Two sectors can contribute to this 
right now: the construction and tourism sectors. 
  There is good development already in the agriculture, 
fishery, and mining sectors. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will there be cabinet changes after 
the promulgation of the Constitution, or will all the ministers 
be maintained? 
  [Fujimori] I evaluate the situation every six months, but 
you 
have seen that all of the ministers have managed well the 
government programs. 
  [Reporter] Could there be some changes? 
  [Fujimori] This possibility can never be discarded, but I 
repeat: The ministers have done an excellent job. 
  [Reporter] The general sales tax [IGV] will be maintained at 
18 percent? 
  [Fujimori] The IGV will be maintained, with the exceptions 
established by the Constituent Congress, especially for 
foodstuffs. 
  [Reporter] The government will not object the law approved 
by 
Congress and will promulgate it? [sentence as heard] 
  [Fujimori] We fully agree with its essence. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Speech by Jaime Yoshiyama Tanaka, president of the Peruvian </F>
Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD), at the ceremony 
promulgating the new Constitution at the Lima Government 
Palace--live] 
  [Text] Mr. President of the Republic of Peru, ladies and 
gentlemen: A year ago during the solemn ceremony installing the 
CCD, we pledged to draft a new Constitution that would serve as 
an efficient instrument to build a modern country with liberty 
and justice for all Peruvians. Today, as a result of the 
outcome of the referendum, which expressed the people's solemn 
mandate, we proclaim that the new Peruvian Constitution is in 
force. [applause] 
  This Constitution, which for the first time in the history 
of 
our Republic, has the backing of the people's vote, is 
democratic, functional, and aimed at bolstering the development 
of current and future generations. 
  The electoral process, which was held openly and within the 
framework of unrestricted liberty, showed the maturity and 
civic- mindedness of the public which participated in a broad 
debate throughout the country to take a stand on the 
Congress-approved constitutional draft bill. 
  We are convinced that the referendum was a historic landmark 
for the consolidation of our democracy, and Peru was the single 
winner. We have left behind past frustrations to forge a viable 
country with opportunities in which all Peruvians will grow. 
The new Constitution ratifies our belief in democracy as a way 
of life that guarantees and encourages the people's freedom, 
human rights, and dignity. The new Constitution reflects the 
people's wish expressed in the elections to choose the current 
Congress, which voted for the state branches' modernity, 
efficiency, and moralization. 
  We have reduced the government's size and excessive 
interventionism to transfer greater responsibility to civilian 
institutions, to free up human resources, and to boost the 
social market system without interference. As of now, the state 
will fulfill three objectives: First, it will be a promoter 
state; that is, it will work toward economic development and 
well-being for the population. Second, it will act as a 
regulator to secure the foundations of real competition without 
privileges, as well as to protect workers, the elderly, mothers, 
and children. Third, the state will also be a compensator 
state, seeking social equity. 
  We have established a single chamber Congress with 120 
members, which is the most appropriate system for our needs. 
Similar to the current Congress, the new Congress will have the 
advantage of being swifter and more efficient in debates and 
legislative production as well as being able to exert political 
control and supervise the handling of public affairs. The 
judicial branch, whose restoration and autonomy is essential for 
the balance of the democratic system and for the working of the 
country, will be freed in the appointment of its magistrates of 
all possible forms of political interference, be it from the 
executive branch or Congress. 
  The appointment of judges and prosecutors, at all levels, 
will be the decision of the National Council of Magistrates, 
which will begin its duties when it completes the task that we 
have entrusted to the Honor Tribunal. The praiseworthy work of 
its five honorable members will soon become evident in the 
appointment of prosecutors and judges. The country's pride, 
prestige, and faith in the justice system will be restored with 
these appointments. 
  The economic regime, which was conceived within a pluralist 
system, is based on private enterprise, whether big or small, as 
the center of development in a market system that is free, 
competitive, and open to international trade in order to 
guarantee a dynamic and sustained growth. 
  We are convinced that our juridical framework will allow us 
to attract foreign investments. We are treating both national 
and foreign investments equally to open more jobs, close the 
existing gap, educate better our children, offer better 
services, and, in sum, bring progress to the country. 
  We have thus acted with foresight and realism. Past 
ideological battles are being replaced, almost everywhere in the 
world, with a more pragmatic relation between market efficiency 
and the social solidarity. 
  Consequently, we foresee a more humane economic system that 
will allow everyone to gain access to the market and its 
benefits. 
  The main tool for Peru to join the modern era is, 
undoubtedly, education. It will be high-quality education 
geared toward humanistic training, work, science, and technology. 
  The Constitution guarantees free education, at all levels, 
in 
public schools. Our contribution was that we extended free and 
compulsory education to the preschool level; this is a step 
forward to train and correctly stimulate our children to enter 
primary school, where the percentage of students who repeat a 
grade and the incidence of school drop-outs are alarming. 
  The modern Peru we want must be sown right now, and the best 
fertilizer for it is education for our children. Children must 
grow like healthy and robust seeds and plants; for this reason, 
I would like to urge all sectors to depoliticize the debate on 
this issue and find the best way to propose an educational 
reform, a priority in the national agenda. 
  The new Constitution is a modern and pragmatic document that 
is inspired by ethical values, but just like any other human 
endeavor, it is a perfectible work. 
  Contrary to totalitarian regimes, democracy is based on the 
plurality of ideas, the tolerance to differences, and the search 
for consensus. The people trust that we will seek points of 
understanding to diminish our differences and establish the 
objectives and priority goals the country needs to face our big 
challenges. This must be shown in the legal norms needed to 
implement the Constitution. 
  The people also hope for greater consensus on the part of 
all 
sectors that are committed to ideas of change in order to give 
stability to the modernization program. 
  Terrorism--this implacable enemy that has caused so much 
death and destruction over the past 12 years--is abating, but it 
has not disappeared. 
  We are going to persist until we eradicate this scourge, 
but we should not allow ourselves to be deceived. If we 
eliminate terrorist violence but overlook poverty and the 
conditions in which millions of Peruvian live, we will be 
exchanging one danger for another. 
  The national reconstruction process must be consolidated. 
Our economy, for example, must grow until the end of this 
century at a rate similar to those of developed countries solely 
to recover the standard of living that we had 20 years ago. The 
illiteracy rate reveals that 2 million people do not know how to 
read and write in Peru; that is, one out of 10 Peruvians does 
not know how to read and write. Seven out of 100 children die 
before they reach age one, and this reveals our poor health 
levels. 
  This painful situation that we inherited was worsened by the 
poor economic and social policies of the past, and we cannot 
remain impassive toward this. This is an immense challenge that 
we will overcome and must tackle together. Only in a real 
democracy can we articulate the contributions of all sectors to 
establish a consensus, integrationist, and consistent force, a 
long-range national project. Congress and the government are 
committed to this task. 
  The great decisions [definiciones] made to relaunch a 
country 
are often painful and traumatic, and thus, a consensus is 
indispensable; this is why no sector or group should reap 
political benefits. We must all feel part of this modernization 
program to ensure that a reform such as the one being 
implemented to modernize the country will last long; we need to 
have a collective determination and consensus. 
  Throughout these years, the government, with the people's 
support, has won the most difficult battles in a country that 
was in ruins. As a result of the good policies of this 
administration, which is responding to a global vision as 
opposed to a short-run vision, we have emerged victorious in the 
main fronts of our struggle against subversion. 
  In the economic arena, we have defeated inflation. We have 
begun to stop the serious recessive process and managed to grow 
this year at a rate of 7 percent of gross national product. We 
also rejoined the international financial community and are 
again creditworthy at the international level. We have 
successfully advanced in privatizing public companies. We now 
have a more organized and healthier institutional structure. We 
enjoy the support of popular organizations and the understanding 
of businessmen and workers. 
  We have a legal framework--that is, the new 
Constitution--which guarantees the application of structural 
reforms that the country requires to modernize itself. The 
people, who have placed their trust in these policies, have 
collaborated with remarkable courage and generosity, but they 
also harbor the hope of seeing better days. 
  The time has come to take a new path. We have to join 
efforts in this frontal battle so that we can venture forth to 
modernization. It is in this spirit, Mr. President, that we 
present for your consideration an initiative to reach a national 
consensus on priority issues related to the people's 
development. The exchange of ideas and the conclusions to be 
reached will guide the government in establishing policies and 
will help Congress in implementing the legal norms the 
Constitution requires. 
  To conclude, allow me to make a reflection. Democracy is 
universally recognized as the system based on freedom which 
promotes economic growth and collective well-being. The 
dramatic events that have crumbled political totalitarianism and 
economic socialism have reconfirmed that democracy is the best 
form of government. The challenge before us is to demonstrate 
that democracy is also able to promote human development in 
Peru. If all of the Peruvians of our generation are able to 
build an authentic democracy--which will bring prosperity and 
happiness to our children and our children's children--all of 
our struggles and sacrifices will have been well worth it. 
Thank you. [applause]

  [Text] Opposition congressmen received with distrust and 
skepticism the president's call for a national consensus on five 
basic points, which include boosting the economy, educational 
reform, and amendments to the new Constitution. 
  During the ceremony to promulgate the new Constitution, 
President Alberto Fujimori issued a call to all sectors to reach 
an agreement to boost the Peruvian economy in 1994. 
  The first reaction from the opposition in Congress was one 
of 
distrust and skepticism. Some said they would participate in 
the dialogue without implying agreement, while others 
categorically rejected the call. 
  [Begin recording] [Congressman Ernesto Gamarra] In view of 
the fact that Mr. Fujimori has made no signs of wanting a 
concerted agreement, I cannot believe in his call to a concerted 
agreement. 
  [Congressman Celso Sotomarino] Ramiro Priale said something 
that I have always liked: To have a dialogue is not to agree. 
Any civilized person should want to have a dialogue. [end 
recording] 
  Regarding educational reform for the next year, which the 
president also announced, members of the Education Committee 
made the following comments: 
  [Begin recording] [Gloria Helfer] One cannot think about 
reform if there is no clear proposal to improve the teachers' 
situation. [end recording] 
  The minority parties in the Democratic Constituent Congress 
described Fujimori's request that constitutional reforms be 
approved by the people as an electoral tactic. The minority 
parties said they have been working on just that to present 
jointly their respective proposals. 
  [Begin Henry Pease recording] I want to announce to the 
country that my faction and I presented the first draft 
constitutional amendment. It is very simple: to abolish the 
seventh transitory clause which established that the next 
legislature will be chosen based on the single-district concept 
[distrito unico]. [end recording]

  [Text] This morning the Senate passed the 1994 national 
budget bill, which contemplates total expenditures of 
2,330,144,000,000 guaranies for the central administration and 
3,518,351,000,000 guaranies for the decentralized 
administration. This is the final version, and the executive 
branch can now promulgate the bill. The Senate ratified its 
original position because legislative proceedings do not allow 
for a partial acceptance of the Chamber of Deputies' amendments. 
  The figures contemplate differentiated salary increases for 
public employees not affected by the Labor Code, just as was 
originally proposed by the Senate the first time it studied the 
document. 
  As a result, teachers and health workers will have two 
adjustments next year, one in January and one in July. Each 
adjustment will be of 10 percent. This final congressional 
decision might reestablish good relations between teachers 
unions and the Education and Worship Ministry, and allow the 
training of teachers who will start the educational reform in 
1994. The adjustments would also prevent strikes from 
disturbing the teaching schedule during the school year. 
<H5>  Military and Policemen </H5>
  Military salaries will have a single adjustment of 10 
percent 
as of January, plus a bonus of 85,000 guaranies for each food 
coupon. 
  The National Police will have differentiated salary 
adjustments: Officers will receive a single 10 percent salary 
adjustment, while noncommissioned officers will receive a single 
20 percent adjustment, both as of January. Both groups will 
also receive 85,000 guaranies for each food coupon, just as does 
the military. 
  Lastly, all other public employees not affected by the Labor 
Code will receive the following adjustments: Those now 
receiving a salary of up to 500,000 guaranies will be granted a 
single adjustment of 10 percent in January, while those earning 
more than 500,000 guaranies will receive a 7.5 percent 
adjustment in July. 
  The Senate rejected the Chamber of Deputies' amendments to 
the Central Bank and Social Security Institute (IPS) budgets. 
  As a result, the Central Bank will not be able to dispose of 
9 billion guaranies for loans to bank employees and local 
contribution to foreign credits aimed at supporting small 
businesses in the country. The IPS will be able to dispose of 
20 billion guaranies broken down as follows: 15 billion for 
loans to companies, and 5 billion for loans to insurers. 
  The figures approved by Congress will not be objected to by 
the executive branch if we believe the last Finance Ministry 
message to Congress, containing a request to the Chamber of 
Deputies to ratify the salary adjustments proposed by the Senate. 
<H5>  Budget Deficit </H5>
  Besides approving each public company budget, the Senate 
also 
approved the legal authorization for the Finance Ministry to 
cover eventual deficits with Central Bank emissions or public or 
private commercial bank credits (BNF [National Development 
Bank], BNT [National Workers Bank], and other banks). These 
financial aids could be considered as taken on account from 
Itaipu royalties when the royalty disbursements are delayed.

  [Text] High-ranking military sources on 29 December 
stressed that there some high-ranking officers who are annoyed 
because they were not given an audience with the president and 
commander in chief of the Armed Forces, Juan Carlos Wasmosy. 
The complaints highlight the fact that when he visits his 
offices at the Armed Forces headquarters, the chief of state 
prefers to meet with [Army Commander in Chief] Division General 
Lino Cesar Oviedo Silva, with whom, according to the reports, he 
meets for two or three hours. 
  The reports indicate that the high-ranking military officers 
are also annoyed because on 29 December Wasmosy abruptly 
suspended the scheduled audiences because of a commitment at 
Government House. 
  Some of the officers expressed their annoyance because they 
had to come from the interior of the country, where their units 
are located, to talk with the commander in chief and to receive 
their instructions. According to the reports, this type of 
situation has become repetitive and fewer and fewer audiences 
are being requested.

<F P=106> [Interview with Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy by </F>
anchorwoman Stella Ruffinelli during the weekly "Coordenadas" 
program from the presidential residence -- recorded, no date 
given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ruffinelli] Let us talk about 
what is probably a more conflictive, but unavoidable, issue. 
Why do people believe [Army Commander] General Lino Oviedo has 
so much power in the country. Is it just their imagination or 
does he really have so much power? I am asking you this 
question in your capacity as commander of the Armed Forces. 
  [Wasmosy] I would say that he is a very active person. 
Within the Armed Forces he is probably the most concerned about 
his subordinates. This attitude is probably interpreted by some 
as if he were the most powerful person within the Armed Forces. 
However, looking you straight in your eyes I can tell you I 
have never had any problems with Lino Oviedo. I, personally, 
here in my office, filled in the posts of the Armed Forces 
organization chart. First I worked on it with [Military Forces 
Commander Vice Admiral Eduardo] Gonzalez Petit, then with the 
Army, Navy, and Air Force Commanders and the chief of the joint 
staff. The logistics commander was also present on some 
occasions as was [Division General Pedro de la Cruz] Ocampos, 
the chief of staff. They can confirm that the appointments were 
made directly by me. 
  I would like refer to those remarks that so-and-so was 
appointed because it will help Oviedo or that so-and-so is 
against so-and-so, and that sort of comment. I can show you the 
service record, the military law, and the seniority list, and 
you will see that I have respected the officers' seniority and 
their merits. So much so that the commanders of the 
engineering, transmission units are the best there are. Nobody 
can accuse me of having discriminated against anybody who was 
the top of his class. By no means. Why do you think they 
respect my decisions. Injustices surface sooner or later. 
  [Ruffinelli] What many people question is the possible 
political actions of Gen. Lino Oviedo. 
  [Wasmosy] Do you consider it to be political action when he 
helps each and everyone in his home town by building a school, 
giving social assistance, and so on. I regard it as absolutely 
normal. Now, if he stood up and said he wants to be president 
of a Colorado Party precinct or that so-and-so must be 
appointed, etc., yes, that is engaging in politics. I would 
really like all my aides to help me. I am being frank and must 
say that many commanders -- within their jurisdiction -- do so. 
Not long ago we dedicated social projects with General Barreto, 
the Curuguaty commander. When these ceremonies occur in rather 
distant regions and there is no transportation, the media just 
do not turn up. 
  [Ruffinelli] When there is no means of transportation? 
  [Wasmosy] This is probably why these ceremonies are not 
covered sufficiently. But they are all doing their best to 
increase the level, to humanize the Army. Soldiers and 
sergeants currently live like human beings. These activities 
are criticized because it is always...[changes thought]... well 
this is the price of being the Army commander, this is the price 
I have to pay for being president of Republic. As a means of 
consolation, and to give myself a bit more courage, when I 
receive criticisms which I accept happily -- well, not happily 
but which I tolerate... 
  [Ruffinelli] Let us talk about that later... 
  [Wasmosy] ...which I tolerate, because we must be frank, I 
tell myself they are directed against the president of the 
Republic. Juan Carlos Wasmosy is president of the Republic, but 
only temporarily. Every criticism is directed against the 
leader, against the authority. That is only normal. It happens 
within the Army, religious congregations, among bishops and 
cardinals, right? For example, you women sometimes complain 
about your husbands, because they are the boss at home. 
  [Ruffinelli] Of course. Well, we will see who is the boss. 
  [Wasmosy] Well, in some cases the husband is the boss. 
  [Ruffinelli] Engineer, sometimes Gen. Oviedo's actions -- 
which may be done in good faith -- are questioned. There is a 
very narrow margin between proselytism, campaigning, and 
engaging in politics. As you well know, this is banned by the 
Constitution. Right from the beginning of this interview you 
have said that your main concern, your main goal is to respect 
the Constitution. Is there any chance, if he were to engage in 
politics, that .... 
  [Wasmosy] If Gen. Oviedo were to engage in politics, let us 
say seeking to obtain a post within a party precinct, that is 
one thing. 
  [Ruffinelli] I don't think he will go that far. 
  [Wasmosy] That situation would justify your criticisms, but 
if he is only helping the government -- to which the Armed 
Forces belong -- implementing social projects because you should 
recall that the Army... 
  [Ruffinelli] Do you believe he is acting in good faith? 
  [Wasmosy] I believe he is acting in good faith. What is 
more, I have no complaints against him. I believe that to have 
the Army cooperating as it is now, guarantees this democratic 
process. 
  [Ruffinelli] Why? 
  [Wasmosy] Because the Army will not tolerate anything that 
violates the Constitution. People believe that we will only 
live in democracy through the downfall of the Colorado Party. 
We are proving that the Colorado Party brought democracy back 
to the country and that it is consolidating this democratic 
process. People also say that free elections and democracy are 
not possible until Lino Oviedo is not discharged or retired. 
That is not true, young lady. Quite the opposite. Let us look 
at things positively. I believe the Colorado Party and an 
institutionalized, well organized, rationalized Armed Forces are 
the best guarantee to consolidate our democracy. This is not a 
story, I am absolutely convinced of what I am saying. 
  [Ruffinelli] Engineer. Changing the subject and referring to 
another subject that has surfaced... 
  [Wasmosy] I don't know whether I am passing your test. 
  [Ruffinelli] I am not testing you. We want to share this 
moment with the SNT listeners throughout the country during the 
last few days of this year. I want to raise another important 
topic which has been a matter of concern lately: drug 
trafficking and money laundering and the U.S. Government's 
concern reflected in a press communique written and signed by 
[U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay] Jon Glassman. What do you have to 
say about this? 
  [Wasmosy] There are three aspects to this problem. There are 
countries that consume drugs, produce drugs, and others that act 
as routes for drug trafficking. Let us hope our country is not 
used as a route between producer and consumer countries. 
  [Ruffinelli] This is what we are being accused of. 
  [Wasmosy] It would be regrettable if our youth became hooked 
on this really lamentable vice. I have repeatedly and publicly 
stated that I am in favor of a total struggle against drug 
trafficking, money laundering, and I am against those who kill 
to steal, who traffic in stolen vehicles, etc. 
  I believe Ambassador Glassman made a rather hasty comment 
when he stated that honest people have been replaced by 
dishonest people, yet failed to say who the dishonest people 
are. One cannot make groundless charges. I respect him in his 
capacity as ambassador but, as long I am president of the 
Republic, I will not allow him to interfere in the domestic 
affairs of this country. Paraguay is a small but sovereign 
country. 
  There is a lot of talk about obscure situations, that 
so-and-so is involved. If people provide me with evidence I 
will dismiss the guilty parties. I have already removed several 
people involved in the contraband of cigarettes, chickens, and 
onions brought from Brazil or Argentina, but one cannot make 
groundless charges and suspect everyone. Do people not trust 
me? I have proven I am trustworthy. I want to tell the 
listeners that I summoned Ambassador Glassman to Government 
House together with [Alternate Senator Eustacio] Morel Garay and 
General Escobar Anzoategui [National Antinarcotics Secretariat, 
Senad, executive secretary] and told him that if he wanted to 
know anything about the Senad he should ask General Escobar and 
not Morel Garay or anybody else because there is a chain of 
command that must be respected. We cannot tolerate intervention 
at the various levels. Either you have trust or you do not. I 
cannot decide if a person is involved in drug trafficking or 
money laundering if I do not have evidence. If you tell me who 
is guilty of these crimes and bring the evidence against the 
person then it is my responsibility to follow it up, but in the 
meantime I cannot prejudge. 
  [Ruffinellii] Engineer, please allow me to mention some 
figures that are of concern to the U.S. Embassy which, as you 
known, is a landmark in international affairs. They say that 
during the past years we have only managed to seize a few kilos 
of cocaine, I think it was 48 kg or a similarly small figure: 
meanwhile neighboring countries talk about tonnes. More than 30 
Paraguayan citizens charged with drug trafficking or consumption 
have been arrested abroad, but this has not happened here. This 
is out of proportion. 
  [Wasmosy] There are two alternatives. Either drug 
trafficking has dropped here or the entire government is 
involved in this trade. Therefore, to uncover the government 
officials involved in this trade I need the necessary means. I 
have asked them to install radar units in Mariscal Estigarribia, 
Ciudad del Este, Concepcion, and Ayolas and to provide two 
helicopter-gunships operated by U.S. Marines. What better proof 
is there than that to show I want to fight this scourge openly. 
  [Ruffinelli] However, they maintain that when you list the 
aid received you do not mention the DEA agents who use the 
infrastructure exclusively designed to fight drug trafficking. 
  [Wasmosy] That is right but the U.S. Embassy has also 
included in the global aid granted us the cost of bringing an 
aircraft with radar [AWACS] to our country. I am grateful to 
them for this aircraft but the decision to send it here was 
theirs. They cannot charge the cost of sending an aircraft 
equipped with radar to the aid granted to Paraguay. They are 
trying to determine the origin of this nefarious merchandise 
which is consumed in their country. They cannot charge this 
cost to the aid granted to us. That is a U.S. expenditure or 
investment, not a Paraguayan expenditure. No. If they were to 
really grant us support and we did not fight drug trafficking, 
then we would be guilty. But with what budget can I fight these 
people who are much better equipped with more sophisticated 
weapons than what our Army has. They have money to buy the most 
sophisticated weapons. We have discussed this subject with the 
presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay. This must be a joint 
effort with the aid of the United States, which is the greatest 
drug consumer. The United States must help us. What can we do 
alone or in an isolated manner? 
  [Ruffinelli] Engineer Wasmosy, do you know how this is being 
interpreted? Jon Glassman, to some extent, has warned that the 
funds obtained from money laundering and drug trafficking may 
become a very strong political power that is very hard to 
eradicate. 
  [Wasmosy] I fully agree with him. 
  [Ruffinelli] What worries him is the impunity that may 
currently prevail in Paraguay and that is generating a system of 
privileges that may even undermine the democracy we are 
currently enjoying. 
  [Wasmosy] This risk not only exists in Paraguay, it exists 
in 
any South American country. 
  [Ruffinelli] We are no exception. 
  [Wasmosy] We are no exception. Do you think it was easy to 
catch [Colombian drug trafficker Pablo] Escobar, or do you think 
he was a sort of superman that flew from one place to another? 
How do you think he got out of prison? There is the answer to 
your question. 
  [Ruffinelli] The key issue of the electoral campaign, and 
even after the campaign, was the economic issue, how to pull out 
of the prevailing situation, how to resume the economic growth. 
Even in your Christmas message, you said you wanted to resume 
the country's growth. We would like to know how you intend to 
go about resuming this growth. 
  [Wasmosy] Basically through the implementation of all the 
corrective measures which, in opinion of the government and 
entire economic team, fall within the government's program. 
Some draft bills are still in Congress. We are still awaiting 
the approval of a law on the Central Bank, a law on 
privatization, the insurance companies law, and many others that 
represent the legal tools necessary to carry out these changes 
in the economic field. According to our possibilities we have, 
however, given the agricultural sector -- the primary producers 
in particular -- the best seed, which is no longer distributed 
by the state but directly by interested parties such as 
cooperatives and association of producers. The producers will 
get the best seed on a timely basis. For the first time too, we 
have placed 305 billion guaranies at the disposal of the primary 
producers before the beginning of the agricultural year. The 
Central Bank and the Finance Ministry used to issue the 
corresponding decrees around mid-December. We issued them 
before the beginning of the agricultural year to really cut that 
chain of... I wouldn't call them usurers, but of those who take 
advantage of the producers ignorance, misinformation, or need, 
and who, instead of giving them money, offer them goods at two 
or three times the real price. 
  [Ruffinelli] However, the great pending issue about which 
everyone talks and wants are job opportunities. 
  [Wasmosy] Right, but job opportunities cannot be created 
overnight. I would like to point out that Brazilian investments 
in our country today are huge and there are industries whose 
projects have been approved by the Industry and Commerce 
Ministry. All this is being elaborated and organized. Together 
with the economic team we have evaluated the best way to create 
more job opportunities and have come to the conclusion that a 
reforestation program would be best. But we need to shoulder 
that financing because it is instrumental in making people 
settle down in one place rather than obliging them to go to live 
in the city ... 
  [Rufinelli] The rural exodus problem. 
  [Wasmosy] ... because they have to weed out the saplings. 
Incidentally, I visited one with the Cordillera governor on the 
Pozuelo River, near the Guaira Falls -- actually it was nearer 
Catuete, near Corpus Christi -- really a veritable model of that 
project. It is a very profitable business. What will the 
government do through the officials from the Agricultural and 
Livestock Development Service? It will promote the idea. There 
have been three poor harvests in a row -- two of them due to low 
international market prices that discouraged farmers who were no 
longer motivated to grow more crops and another caused by 
adverse weather conditions. I can tell you -- and by the way, I 
have just returned from Arroyito, Horqueta, and other places 
where I saw that the cotton crop is greater than ever as is the 
case of corn and new crops in our country, namely sunflower -- 
that this year without a shadow of a doubt that our export 
earnings will exceed $1 billion. Whenever agricultural 
activities are doing well, and farmers and agricultural 
producers get a fair price for the fruit of their work, then it 
follows necessarily that wholesalers, truck drivers, retailers, 
and importers earn money too. There is a domino effect, in the 
same way that construction is the best catalyst to produce a 
trickle-down effect in the whole economy. Hence, I believe that 
by strengthening the basis of production, there will be an 
automatic upswing, and consequently, the number of truck drivers 
will increase, which in turn means more jobs. And yet, what is 
really striking at present is the shortage of school teachers to 
teach the 135,000 children that are without a teacher... 
  [Rufinelli] What are we doing about this? 
  [Wasmosy] This indeed concerns me. People from the private 
sector have offered to train 2,000 teachers. They are already 
doing so. But we are still 3,000 short and time is running out. 
Thus, I urge all these youngsters whom I had the honor of 
presenting their high-school diplomas to take up teaching so 
that they may stay where they were born and bred. There are 
also those who want to study but lack the means to do so. We 
are granting them scholarships. I am looking for businessmen, 
traders, industrialists to defray the cost of those studies. 
Aldo Zucolillo from ABC COLOR newspaper, for example, has 
already pledged to finance schools in Villa Florida. We are also 
contemplating doing something comparable at Inagrisa [Wasmosy's 
own company] in those places which constitute its area of 
production. We need other companies to cover that deficit. I 
would not like to resort to the Army because whenever we are in 
a quandary we turn to the Army and then we criticize it for 
intervening. Imagine that, a joint action to check smuggling. 
You can easily verify that all breweries are currently working 
around the clock while in the past they only worked a six or 
eight hours per day. You may wonder why. Well, because we 
curbed the smuggling of beer. Then people say: There are no 
openings. No. We want legal jobs. The same applies to 
contraband chickens. We have contained this, preventing them 
from entering the country. After we seized a considerable 
number of contraband chickens, the price started to go up. Then 
we liberalize imports so that we may substitute smuggling with 
legal importation of products through the payment of customs 
duties. And who are those importers? The producers themselves 
since there is total freedom for importing goods into the 
country. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At 0543 this morning, the special congress session 
that lasted almost 10 hours concluded. The nation's legislators 
approved the tax reform bill sent by the Executive Branch but 
with substantial modifications. Here we have a report by 
Eugenia Salazar: 
  [Begin Salazar recording] Heinz Moeller, leader of the 
Social 
Christian parliamentary faction, maintained that the Ecuadoran 
people succeeded in view of the Executive Branch's attempt to 
increase IVA [value added tax] by 8 percent under the pretext of 
a drop in the oil prices at the international market. Moeller 
said that his party headed the struggle against the taxes and 
rejected the government intentions to increase them. The public 
backed this position and this prevented the government from 
insisting on an IVA increase. 
  The Social Christian deputy praised the Executive Branch's 
political decision to order its deputies to remain in the 
sessions to permit the required quorum. This decision permitted 
the approval of the tax reform bill without the 8-percent 
increase that was initially proposed by the government. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Quito -- The Ecuadoran Government has announced that 
it will continue to pay the debt with international financial 
organizations despite the drop in revenues caused by a reduction 
in the price of export crude. 
  Finance Minister Cesar Robalino said: We must pay financial 
organizations whether we have a crisis or not. Asked what will 
happen to the debt with commercial banks, the minister said: We 
will see what happens but at this moment, we are not paying the 
commercial debt or its interest. 
  Ecuador has an overall foreign debt that surpasses $12.550 
billion of which $6.5 billion are contracted with commercial 
banks and the rest with Western governments and international 
financial organizations. For the past year, Ecuador has been 
negotiating a program to reduce and refinance the debt. It has 
also been negotiating an adjustment agreement with the IMF, but 
it has been unsuccessful in both cases. Meanwhile, government 
officials predicted that the impending fiscal crisis prompted by 
the drop in crude prices will not have grave effects on the 
foreign debt negotiations. 
  On Wednesday, Finance Minister Robalino told reporters that 
Ecuador will continue to pay what it owes international 
financial organizations regardless of a crisis. Robalino, who 
heads the debt negotiations team, added that one will have to 
see what happens in the relations with the creditor banks. 
However, he stressed, the suspension of debt payments that 
became effective in May 1992, will remain in effect. 
  In addition, Central Bank Manager Augusto De la Torre said 
that the government strategy is to avoid, at any expense, a 
fiscal imbalance and the reactivation of inflation. He noted 
that this will allow Ecuador to guarantee a good understanding 
with creditors. De la Torre said that he hopes that the fiscal 
crisis will not affect the debt negotiations. The government is 
bent on avoiding a fiscal imbalance and in the wake of Congress' 
approval of the budget, it will have to think of more profound 
cuts in expenditures. He added that the government is firm in 
its objective to avoid a fiscal imbalance and if this is 
attained, and I hope it will be, he said, then we will get IMF 
approval for our country's economic program.

  [Text] Quito -- The country's 1994 budget amounts to 6.2 
trillion sucres, the pertinent document was signed today. 
  Effective today, the Ecuadoran State will have a new 1994 
general budget: 5.985588 trillion sucres is the money that the 
state will have available next year. Members of the Congress 
Budget Committee and Finance Minister Cesar Robalino signed the 
pertinent document. 
  [Begin Budget Committee Chairman Jorge Marun recording] We 
completed the presentation of a draft fiscal budget for 1994 
which is totally financed. It is a budget that will allow the 
Executive Branch to carry out its [word indistinct] program. 
This is great satisfaction for the National Congress and the 
Budget Committee and we honestly think that we fulfilled our 
duty to the Ecuadoran fatherland. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Robalino described 1993 as an economic success. 
  The 1994 budget, based on an average of $13 per barrel of 
oil, mainly includes plans to help the social sector. Thirty 
percent of the budget will be spent on education. Other sectors 
are also included in it, such as health, public projects, and 
social welfare, areas that did not have a budget before, this is 
the opinion of Eduardo Villaquiran, a member of the Budget 
Committee: 
  [Begin Villaquiran recording] The country has a budget that 
is fully financed, and financed without taxes. It was financed 
at a lower figure than that which the Executive Branch sent to 
us. This is very important. Every year the draft budget is 
sent to Congress and it is usually approved with its financing, 
but with higher figures. This time, it was a lower figure and 
this is due to a lack of revenues caused by the drop in the 
price of a barrel of oil. [end recording] 
  In addition, each deputy will get 600 million sucres to 
carry 
out projects in their provinces.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Dec (NA) -- Government House has 
announced that President Carlos Menem this evening promulgated 
the law declaring the need to reform the Constitution. The bill 
was approved by the Senate early this morning. 
  The promulgation of this law, the senators' claim to have 
been the chamber that submitted the law, and their decision to 
modify the duration of the senators' terms today elicited 
various reactions from the leaders of the Justicialist Party 
[PJ], the UCR [Radical Civic Union], and other political sectors. 
  National UCR Deputy Leopoldo Moreau criticized the 
"shortsightedness" of his fellow party members who opposed the 
constitutional reform, adding that Fernando de la Rua "has not 
understood the change that this reform will imply for the 
consolidation of democracy." 
  In a conversation with NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS, Moreau 
reiterated 
that "(the reform project) originated in the Chamber of 
Deputies," but said that this matter is not "essential" enough 
to cause a constitutional conflict. 
  For his part, Senator De la Rua criticized the contents of 
the law, because "far from reducing presidential powers, it 
increases them," noting that Buenos Aires UCR Constituent 
Assembly delegates "will adopt their own position" in spite of 
any decision by the party. 
  De la Rua, who also talked with NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS, said 
that the minister of coordination, which is created by the 
reform, "is an entelechy," reiterating that the possibility of 
reelection of the current president "violates ethical rules." 
  He added that "the bill did not follow the usual steps," 
noting that "it should have returned to the Chamber of Deputies" 
after the Senate eliminated the paragraph reducing the senators' 
terms. 
  PJ Senator Antonio Cafiero said there is "firm discipline" 
in 
the PJ bloc in the Senate, remarking that "only one paragraph" 
of the law establishing the need to reform the Constitution had 
been modified. 
  Cafiero explained that the Senate "failed to endorse only 
one 
paragraph of the law" because it is an exception, adding that 
the decision to reject the reduction of senators' terms to four 
years "was unanimous." 
  "As we are considering a law that should be approved by a 
two-thirds majority in each chamber, the five steps provided for 
for common bills do not apply," Cafiero said. 
  For his part, Progressive Democracy Deputy Alberto Natale 
said that the Senate decision to modify the decision by the 
Chamber of Deputies "makes it mandatory that the bill be 
returned to the Chamber of Deputies." 
  According to Natale, "congressional proceedings which are 
ruled by the Constitution include the list of steps to be taken 
for a bill to be approved by Congress." 
  Natale added that "the bill should return to the Chamber of 
Deputies, because otherwise the constitutional reform will not 
have a healthy birth." 
  Socialist Unity Deputy Hector Polino also said that the law 
on the need to reform the Constitution "does not meet the 
requirements for submission to the executive branch," adding 
that the Senate approval was "unconstitutional." 
  Polino explained that "there are two different bills, each 
of 
which were approved by just one chamber of Congress," noting 
that "congressional proceedings have not been completed for 
either one." 
  "The entire reform process has been embarrassing, and the 
conclusion they are trying reach in Congress implies the death 
of the country's entire constitutional doctrine." 
  National Senator Jose Antonio Romero Feris justified his 
vote 
against the reform on the grounds that "before thinking of 
modifying the Constitution it is necessary to comply with it." 
  Romero Feris added that the introduction of runoff elections 
and the post of minister of coordination "do not entail any kind 
of restrictions on the powers of the president." 
  He said that "the pact was reached behind closed doors, and 
was approved -- reluctantly but with Prussian discipline -- by 
the lawmakers of the majority parties." 
  National PJ Senator Oraldo Britos said the bill originated 
with the Senate, and that "some articles were eliminated because 
the Chamber of Deputies did not take into account the bill that 
was submitted by the Senate." 
  Britos added that the duration of senatorial terms "will be 
decided by the Constituent Assembly, because the Senate has 
proposed six years." 
  Finally, Raul Alfonsin's spokesman Simon Lazara said that 
the 
Senate rejection of the four-year term proposed for national 
senators was "lamentable," although he explained that this 
decision "does not affect the group of basic agreements" reached 
by the PJ and the UCR. 
  "It is obviously the defense of sectorial interests, an 
attitude that impairs the image of the Senate and that does not 
match the spirit of the reform agreement," Lazara told NOTICIAS 
ARGENTINAS. 
  Mendoza leader Raul Baglini (until a few days ago the leader 
of the bloc of national UCR deputies), said that "now that the 
constitutional reform law has been approved the UCR should 
overcome its internal disagreements -- which have been broadly 
disseminated because of the importance of the subject -- and 
should prepare for the election of Constituent Assembly members, 
thus guaranteeing a modern reform with equilibrium between the 
branches of government."

<F P=106> [Article by Ibeth Vega G.] </F>
  [Text] With the approval of a new constitutional article 
governing the administration of the Panama Canal after the year 
2000 and the creation of ARI [Interoceanic Region Authority], 
Panama now has the two tools necessary to meet the enormous 
responsibility of administering the waterway -- once it is in 
Panamanian hands -- President Guillermo Endara told LA PRENSA. 
  Endara's statement came after the article was approved in 
the 
Legislative Assembly's third and final debate on the 
constitutional article that calls for the creation of the Panama 
Canal Authority, which will administer the waterway at the end 
of the century. 
  Endara said: "I am very proud of the Panamanian Government 
-- 
I regard the legislative branch as part of the government -- for 
approving the new constitutional article. One of the most 
important missions of this transition government was to prepare 
Panama for noon, 30 December 1999, when the United States will 
turn over the canal." 
  Endara pointed out that since 1977, the dictatorship 
governments never made any serious effort to prepare Panamanians 
for the serious responsibility of administering the canal. He 
added, "All they did was give speeches and disseminate 
self-serving propaganda, but there was nothing concrete." 
  To become part of the Constitution, the new constitutional 
article has to be ratified by the next Legislative Assembly that 
will be created in the 8 May elections. 
  Endara said: "I believe Panama has two basic tools for the 
immense responsibility it faces. Of course, now the work has to 
be done, and, therefore, these two institutions' efforts in the 
future will have to be intense, dedicated, and very patriotic." 
  The president said he felt satisfied and pleased that these 
two "tools" had been created during his administration.

<F P=106> [Report by Colin King] </F>
  [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 31 Dec, CANA -- The Cheddi Jagan 
government has moved to parliament, seeking to dissolve the 
Georgetown City Council and set up an interim management body to 
run the affairs of the city. 
  A municipal councils (temporary provisions) bill 1993, was 
tabled in the National Assembly Thursday. 
  This becomes law, the Georgetown council will be scrapped 
and 
an interim management committee appointed by the minister. 
[sentence as received] 
  The other municipal bodies -- town councils of Linden, New 
Amsterdam, Rose Hall and Corriverton -- would continue in office 
until their elections are held, provided these elections are 
held before July 31, 1994. In the event the elections for the 
four town councils are not held by the stipulated date, then 
interim management committees would be required from the same 
date. 
  But the parliamentary opposition Working People's Alliance 
wants all five municipal councils to be dissolved. At the final 
sitting of the house Thursday, the wpa charged that with 
elections overdue, councils malfunctioning and service to 
citizens deteriorating, there was a "crisis" in local government. 
  The WPA called for the dissolution of "all local government 
councils in Georgetown, the towns and throughout the rural 
community". The party said parliamentary parties should arrive 
at consensus on the appointment of "interim management 
councils...to execute the first stage of a programme of 
municipal rehabilitation". But added that in the absence of 
constitutional reform to allow a "workable" system of local 
government, it would be unwilling to contest any elections. 
  Guyana's five municipal councils were appointed by the 
previous People's National Congress (PNC) government after 
uncontested municipal elections in 1992. The councils were then 
asked by the new goverment to remain in office for an extra year 
ending December 1993, after delays in the election date. 
  A date for fresh municipal elections is still to be set. 
  The Jagan administration has since been at loggerheads with 
the Georgetown council, saying it has been showing "a growing 
paralysis and dysfunctioning", and does not have the support of 
citizens. 
  The National Assembly is expected to resume sitting in the 
second week of January, when the bill could come up for debate.

  [Text] General Ramon Emilio Gil Bermudez, acting defense 
minister, confronted today the dust storm unleashed by the 
arrival of U.S. soldiers in Bahia de Malaga. He insisted that 
it is just a technical collaboration and said that the Armed 
Forces' 1994 objective is to capture the guerrillas' leaders. 
  Gil reiterated today that the presence of U.S. soldiers in 
the Colombian Pacific area is simply due to technical 
collaboration. 
  [Begin Gil recording] The real reason why they--not Marines, 
but military engineers or a detachment of military 
engineers--are here is to execute an operation of mutual 
assistance. [end recording] 
  Gil downplayed the importance of the Americas Watch reports, 
which accuse the mobile brigades of violating human rights in 
certain areas of Colombia. 
  [Begin Gil recording] The reports that reach these 
organizations have already been distorted; they have an 
intention that favors criminals. [end recording] 
  Gil said the Army's main objective for 1994 is to reduce the 
offensive capability of guerrillas and, if possible, capture the 
leaders.

  [Text] Mexico City, 1 Jan (EFE) -- Rebels from the 
self-styled Zapata Liberation Army [Ejercito Zapatista de 
Liberacion -- EZL] have taken over the mayoral offices in the 
towns of Ocosingo, San Cristobal de las Casas, and Las 
Margaritas, where the rebels have set fires and destroyed the 
files of the Attorney General's Offices in these three towns. 
  According to a Mexican television station, the rebel group 
issued a communique this morning. In the communique, the group 
proclaims itself a guerrilla movement and declares war on the 
Mexican Army, which it challenges to fight in the mountainous 
area of the southern state of Chiapas. So far, there are no 
reports of any casualties, but the rebels have closed off the 
entries and exits of those three towns.

  [Excerpt] Lima, 31 Dec (NOTIMEX) -- Peruvian President 
Alberto Fujimori today called on the Armed Forces to redouble 
security measures in Lima and other major cities to prevent more 
terrorist attacks like those that have taken place in past days. 
  During a meeting held this afternoon with the National 
Intelligence Service (SIN) high command, the president gave 
several guidelines to the official forces to encourage them to 
continue struggling effectively against the subversive groups. 
  Fujimori demanded more protection for the population, 
particularly now when the nation is preparing to celebrate the 
new year. 
  Fujimori later traveled to the southern Andean city of 
Arequipa, where he will celebrate the year's end. There he 
evaluated the country's political violence along with the 
intelligence services chiefs and the military high command. 
  Armed Forces and police authorities increased security 
measures in the capital city after several attacks this week 
resulted in two deaths, dozens of injured, and considerable 
property damage. [passages omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 30 Dec (NA) -- Official sources on 30 
December reported that Social Action Secretary Felix Borgonovo 
resigned today and he will be replaced by Jorge Fornes, an 
accountant from Mendoza Province. 
  The resignation of the high-ranking official of the Health 
and Social Action Ministry was based on the fact that "he stated 
that he had carried out the administrative mission he had been 
charged with." 
  Borgonovo, who had been under secretary under Secretary 
General of the Presidency Eduardo Bauza [when he was interior 
minister], will once again work with Bauza as an adviser. 
  Some political sources have interpreted Borgonovo's 
resignation as a step toward an upcoming replacement of Health 
Minister Alberto Mazza. 
  Moreover, a high-ranking government source denied this 
possibility and stressed that Mazza will continue in his post 
and that Borgonovo's leaving was due simply to the fact that "he 
had concluded his internal administrative mission." 
  Fornes is an accountant who for a long time worked within 
the 
private sector in Mendoza Province, mainly with the Nazar 
Construction Enterprise, whose owner is linked to the radicals. 
  Borgonovo's replacement was named by Mazza and he is 
considered to be a man who is close to Bauza's political faction 
in Mendoza.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Santiago del Estero trustee Juan </F>
Schiaretti by Maria Ines Espeche in Santiago; date not given] 
  [Text] [Espeche] Your intervention began 10 days ago. What 
is the situation in Santiago? 
  [Schiaretti] The social climate is one of absolute calm and 
tranquility, so much so that yesterday Border Police officers 
withdrew and the provincial police resumed the supervision of 
law and order in town. The population has great expectations 
that the intervention will solve the crisis. People receive us 
warmly and happily wherever we go. Santiago will have to 
reconstruct everything anew because the government and the 
economy collapsed. 
  [Espeche] Do you think 150 days will be enough to straighten 
things out? Could this period be extended? 
  [Schiaretti] I will strictly comply with the congressional 
law establishing that we must call for new elections within 150 
days. Those are the instructions I received from the president 
of the Republic. 
  [Espeche] Why did things get so far out of hand as to need 
an 
intervention? 
  [Schiaretti] The national government and all the forces that 
coexist in Congress have always preferred solutions proposed by 
the provinces. Here the two main political forces, Santiago's 
two largest political parties, wanted a solution worked out 
among themselves without federal intervention. The proposal was 
made in a climate of obvious political stress amid a gross 
mishandling of the public administration. Regrettably, local 
leaders were unable to find a solution and this provoked the 
social outburst. 
  [Espeche] Various provinces are experiencing delicate 
situations. Is that also due to mismanagement or is it because 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo overlooked the provinces in the 
economic plan?. 
  [Schiaretti] We cannot say that the economic plan overlooked 
the provinces because Santiago del Estero, for instance, 
received twice as much in coparticipation funds this year as it 
did two years ago. The province used to receive a little less 
than 20 million pesos per month and now receives nearly 40 
million pesos per month. Therefore, we cannot speak about 
anybody overlooking anything. The province had a balanced 
situation before. 
  [Espeche] But it has been badly administered for the past 10 
years? Was that not known at a national level? 
  [Schiaretti] Yes, but we have a representative, republican, 
and federal system. The people in the provinces elect their own 
authorities and our Constitution establishes how the federal 
government should act. The Constitution establishes federal and 
provincial government attributions. The people in each province 
must elect their governments and then decide with their votes if 
that government was good or bad. 
  [Espeche] Do you think the situation in Santiago and other 
provinces has nothing to do with the adjustment proposed by the 
federal government? 
  [Schiaretti] You cannot speak about adjustment when the 
amount of federal coparticipation has doubled. Besides, the 
situation was provoked by mismanagement. The province had a 
balance financial situation just a year ago, but then 
legislators were granted monthly salaries of 17,000 pesos, 
judges and employees received 15,000 pesos, advisers earned 
8,000 pesos; public servants were selected for their political 
affiliation; councilmen received salaries of 6,000 pesos; and 
new municipal councils were created at the same time health 
centers were being closed. The population saw that many people 
were doing well while the mismanagement was bringing misery to 
the population. These were the reasons behind the people's 
indignation. The usual agitators and subversives took 
advantage of the situation to loot and destroy. 
  [Espeche] The people demand justice in Santiago, that is, 
the 
punishment of those involved in corruption. Will the 
intervention answer this popular petition? 
  [Schiaretti] The justice department will investigate all 
reports. No one will be excluded. The state attorney general 
was instructed to report on all cases of corruption in the 
province. The court will act from there. We are already working 
on some cases and we will report what we find as soon as we have 
something. 
  [Espeche] It is obvious that Cavallo's plan is going through 
a trial by fire considering what is happening in the provinces. 
Do you think President Carlos Menem might stop supporting 
Cavallo if his reelection is in danger? 
  [Schiaretti] I do not think so because the economic plan is 
President Menem's plan. Minister Cavallo is carrying out the 
economic policy that the president chose for Argentina. 
Besides, the social outburst in Santiago has never been against 
the national government but against the administration of local 
leaders.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 29 Dec (NA) -- The Province of Chubut 
tonight joined the other provinces that have signed the Fiscal 
Pact for Employment, Production, and Growth sponsored by the 
Economy Ministry. 
  The signing of the act was made in the Coat of Arms Hall of 
the Interior Ministry by Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, Labor 
Minister Armando Caro Figueroa, and Chubut Vice Governor Jorge 
Aubia on behalf of Governor Carlos Maestro, who is on leave. 
  With the admission of Chubut to the Fiscal Pact, according 
to 
the act signed tonight, there is a balance in favor of the 
province of a little over 57 million pesos, which corresponds to 
a credit balance of 61 million pesos and to a debt with the 
nation of 4 million pesos. 
  The agreement also "resolved once and for all many claims 
and 
trials involving the nation and the province" through the 
signing of the act "for the reorganization of the financial 
situation between the state and the Province of Chubut." 
  This is how the government was able to get the support of 
one 
of the provinces opposed to the Fiscal Pact. Cordoba and 
Catamarca Provinces may also join the initiative. 
  In addition to these two provinces, the others that still 
remain to sign the agreement proposed by the government are Rio 
Negro and Santa Cruz Provinces. 
  Minister Ruckauf expressed optimism that when the meeting of 
the governors with President Carlos Menem is held next January 
in Chapadmallal "all the provinces will have joined the Fiscal 
Pact."

  [Text] (DYN-NA) -- The General Labour Confederation's (CGT) 
Central Confederate Committee yesterday [29 December] gave the 
green light for its Directive Council to call a nationwide 
strike and rally in Plaza de Mayo before January 31 "if the 
government does not provide an answer to workers' demands." 
  In a session rife with criticism of President Carlos Menem 
and his government the committee approved the plan submitted by 
the UGTT [expansion unknown] and UTA [Motor Transport Workers 
Union] transport workers unions to walk off the job if the 
government ignores the labour movement's major demands. These 
include loosening up on the austerity measures that have caused 
unrest in the country's poorer provinces and dropping the plan 
to reduce employer contributions to union-run health care and 
other services. 
  Notably absent from yesterday's session were such staunch 
government supporters as the head of the ANSSAL [National Health 
Insurance Administration] social security administration, Jose 
Luis Lingeri, Obras Sanitarias Waterworks union, Ramon Valle, 
and UPCN [National Civil Service Personnel Union] civil servants 
union, Andres Rodriguez, who is currently in the United States. 
  Also absent were UOM [Metalworkers Union] metalworkers 
leader 
Lorenzo Miguel and restaurant workers chief Luis Barrionuevo. 
  In a critical statement the CGT warned that the government 
could not expect its belt-tightening measures -- which would 
result in the dismissal of thousands of provincial employees 
among other effects -- to be successful "if a strong network of 
social protection is not simultaneously erected." 
  As regards the government's plan to roll back employer 
contributions by up to 80 percent in order to cut the so-called 
"Argentine cost" of doing business, the CGT said: "(It) 
conspires against social justice and contradicts the more 
developed policies in that area." 
  The government's plans to make labour legislation fared no 
better as the confederation said they would "increase 
unemployment, underemployment and marginalization." 
  The CGT attributed the government's policies to "a 
dehumanizing, anti-Christian concept of the economy stemming 
from the savage capitalism that degrades humanity and seeks to 
convert it into one more raw material for economic production." 
  Numerous labour leaders made statements similar to those 
expressed by health industry leader Carlos West Ocampo. 
  "We don't give a darn about twisting the President's arm," 
said West Ocampo. "This government has condemned thousands of 
workers to hunger and misery and the Justicialist Party is at 
his service."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Argentina monitored through 30 
December. 
  The Economic Programming Secretariat on 23 December reported 
that the primary surplus, not including privatizations, that was 
agreed with the IMF for 1994 totals $3.7 billion. (Buenos Aires 
LA PRENSA in Spanish 24 Dec 93 Section 2 p 4) 
  The Argentine Foreign Ministry has reported that in the 
first 
nine months of the year Argentina exported to Brazil oil and oil 
by-products worth $296 million, an increase of 240 percent 
compared with 1992 when exports to Brazil were $87 million. 
(Buenos Aires LA PRENSA in Spanish 24 Dec 93 Section 2 p 4) 
  Real salaries for industrial workers have fallen 1.77 
percent 
in the last year, according to figures released on 28 December 
by the Argentine Business University. Industrial workers earned 
almost 2 percent year more last December than they will this 
month. (Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD in English 29 Dec 93 p 
5) 
  The Inter-American Development Bank on 16 December announced 
the approval of a $95 million loan to Argentina to start a 
technology development program to increase efficiceny in 
production businesses and the public sector. The plan calls for 
the creation of an Argentine Technological Fund (FONTAR) which 
will finance technological training and innovation in privatized 
companies and public institutions, excluding universities. The 
total cost of the program is estimated at $190 million, with 
$62.5 million dollars coming from the federal budget and $32.5 
million from the Banco Nacion. (Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES

  [Text] Havana, 1 Jan (EFE) -- It is difficult to expect a 
change in the relations between the United States and Cuba 
because "the circumstances are not favorable for an 
understanding," Cuban Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez 
asserted in an interview that was published in the official 
GRANMA newspaper today. 
  "There is enough time and the North Americans know this. If 
circumstances are not favorable to them, they will have the time 
to change, and that explains their attitude," the veteran 
communist politician, who has occupied important positions in 
Fidel Castro's government, observed. 
  Carlos Rafael Rodriguez noted that Bill Clinton's 
administration "has taken a stand based on the notion that Cuba 
could collapse in the immediate future. Additionally, it is 
under pressure from the most recalcitrant sectors of the 
Cuban-American community and its allies, and it is not pressed 
to make decisions." He pointed out that it is necessary "to 
show firmness and for our economic policies to be successful. 
Both concerns guide Cuba's thoughts currently. The U.S. policy 
on Cuba has had a weak international response as was 
demonstrated with the UN approval of the resolution condemning 
the blockade against Cuba." 
  Rodriguez also revealed that during the U.S. Democrat 
President James Carter's administration, Cuba and the United 
States had held high level contacts to initiate negotiations. 
However, he explained, the possible solution of the U.S.-Cuban 
crisis was interrupted at that time due to Carter's decision to 
accuse Cuba of being responsible for the internal conflict in 
Zaire between armed organizations which had retreated to the 
area bordering with Angola. 
  Rodriguez recalled that on the same day that hostilities 
started in the African country, he was to hold a secret meeting 
with the then Secretary of State Cyrus Vance in New York. Prior 
to the meeting, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez listened to Carter's 
speech and his charges against Cuba. Vance was meeting with 
former USSR Foreign Minister Andrey Gromyko at the time, thus, 
when they met "it was I who informed (Vance) of Carter's 
statements." This is how the attempt to initiate negotiations 
ended. Evidently, Vance did not know that Carter had decided to 
make such an announcement and, embarrassed, he ended the 
meeting. The controversy ended when the truth emerged: Cuba had 
not participated in that adventure. However, the opportunity to 
initiate negotiations had passed," he said. 
  In his opinion, however, it was during the Reagan and Bush 
administrations "when we felt -- after the difficult days of the 
U.S. aggression during the Kennedy era -- the possible effects 
of a direct U.S. aggression against Cuba. We went through 12 
years of continuous hostility with badly feigned or direct 
threats," he explained. It is said that Republican governments 
threaten and Democratic governments act against Cuba. This was 
not the case with the Reagan and Bush administrations because 
only Cuba's firmness and international solidarity impeded a 
direct attack against our country during those 12 years," Carlos 
Rafael Rodriguez asserted.

  [Text] La Paz, 30 Dec (EFE) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada today announced that 1994 will be the year of 
great structural changes, when the traditional "come back 
tomorrow" of public administration will become a thing of the 
past. 
  Sanchez de Lozada today, Thursday, met with the local press 
at a rural spa in Cochabamba, where he is resting for a few days 
to "recharge his batteries" before facing the challenge of the 
change beginning with the preparation of the nation's general 
budget. 
  The president explained that the budget proposal he will 
send 
to congress will be accompanied by several draft laws "which 
will give meaning to the budget" and which will implement the 
structural changes. 
  "The first drafts show that more than half of the budget 
will 
be earmarked for the social area," Sanchez de Lozada said, 
because "great structural changes must be made to cover the 
growing social needs, to serve as the basis of the coming year: 
capitalization, educational reform, law against corruption, 
people's participation, and simplification of bureaucracy." 
  The 63-year-old Bolivian president said that for 1994 there 
will be an increase [in salaries] of 7.5 percent in order to 
maintain the purchasing power of the salary and that will be 
equal to the inflation rate calculated for this year. 
  "If we begin with greater increases, we will have higher 
inflation, greater deficit, and a lower level of economic 
growth," Sanchez de Lozada said, and asked whether it was worth 
having considerable increases, which would later be overcome by 
the increases in prices. 
  He ruled out the reported increase in fuel prices which 
prompted the increase in prices and hoarding of other products, 
and added that he will adopt other measures to improve income, 
such as reducing the tax rates and increasing the tax base. 
  Sanchez de Lozada said that a system to simplify state 
administration transactions will be implemented next year, thus 
seeking "to eliminate the torment the citizens" must go through 
when they are involved in these transactions and to eliminate 
from public offices the "come back tomorrow." 
  He ruled out any change in his cabinet. "It was so difficult 
for me to organize it," he said. He added that if it does not 
yield the expected results in the future, there might be some 
changes. 
  He compared the structure of the Council of Ministers he 
inherited from the previous government with a "Model-T Ford with 
which we could not win a formula one race." He added: "I built a 
race car that could not start because it was not well tuned." 
  Sanchez de Lozada was optimistic over the state of his "race 
car" although he admitted that "if we begin to run strong and if 
some part breaks down we will have to fix it quickly" to meet 
the expectations of the Bolivians who want to see the government 
working. 
  The Bolivian president will return from Cochabamba, 383 
kilometers east of La Paz, next week.

  [Editorial Report] Havana Tele Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 0000 GMT on 29 December broadcasts highlights of the morning 
session of the National Assembly of the People's Government 
[ANPP] plenum at the Convention Center in Havana. ANPP President 
Ricardo Alarcon opens the session, stating: "With 533 delegates, 
a 90.8 percent attendance, we declare our meeting open. It is 
now our duty to examine the third point of our agenda, the 
discussion of ratification of the decree laws and accords issued 
by the Council of State. We have in our hands a note from 
Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz, president of the Council of State, 
listing the decree laws and accords issued from 1 June to 30 
November 1993." 
  Alarcon gives the floor to delegate Alexis Hernandez who 
expresses full support for decree laws no. 141 and 142, but 
stresses concern over their unregulated application, and speaks 
against the potential "for selfishness, personal interests." 
Delegate Alicia Blanco Fernandez states that decree law 141 
lacks some definition and needs clarification of the activities 
it comprises. 
  Delegate Genoveva Morales observes that people are upset 
with 
the halt on licenses for certain self-employment jobs and with 
the fact that messengers are exempt from paying taxes. Alarcon 
stresses that comrades have spoken in support of ratification, 
but have expressed concerns with implementation of the decree 
law. This, he says, is not the issue. 
  Castro states: "Alarcon, I agree with what you have said and 
with the issue of methodology. Nevertheless, I am worried about 
the concerns of our comrades, some of them presidents of the 
People's Councils, who have to answer this and that. 
  "Some comrades have brought up ideological issues. They 
said: 
I agree with this; but I do not like that because it might 
result in this or that consequence, misuse. I well understood 
the first two who spoke. But I did not understand the third 
comrade very well. I do not wish to get off the agenda and 
dedicate today, tomorrow, and the next day to discussing this, 
perhaps until 2 or 3 January, because we would destroy the 
agenda if we changed it. This is enough material for three days." 
  Castro chats about the messenger job and the granting of 
licenses. 
  Delegate Genoveva Morales adds that she disaproves of the 
fact that certain comrades are growing rich inappropriately and 
asks where they are getting the fuel, meat, rice, beer, and 
beans. 
  Castro adds: "I am not bothered by the uneasiness. This 
means 
that people have a socialist awareness; they do not like to be 
robbed. That is bad news for the supporters of capitalism. Man, 
if the people do not understand this, how in hell are they going 
to resign themselves to living under capitalism? Capitalism is 
constant, incessant robbery, permanent, incessant inequality. I 
do not know if Alarcon wishes to talk a bit more about this." 
Alarcon and Castro chat about the number of speakers who have 
asked to speak. 
  Castro states: "If there are mistakes, we are all 
responsible 
for those mistakes -- those who have promoted and issue decree 
laws. We could bring the comrade responsible for the decree here 
to speak. Everyone knows that we have to speak here and take 
responsibility for what is done. There are evident 
contradictions that anyone can understand. We have done certain 
things here that I have half regretted. It is the truth, but we 
cannot deny that there are contradictions." 
  Delegate Jose Antonio Perez Gonzalez stresses his concerns 
with decree law 141. He believes that honest people should be 
allowed to be self-employed, and that although these jobs will 
not solve problems, it will help many people. He adds: "I do not 
think all these people are dishonest." 
  Delegate Maria Ducas observes that there is uneasiness among 
the population regarding the fact that messengers do not pay 
taxes while others have many regulations piled on them. 
Likewise, there is a lack of control by the inspectors. The 
people are not aware of the details of the law, and certain 
comrades have been given licenses while others have not. Ducas 
gives examples of People's Council involvement in regulating 
proper implementation of the law, recommends that the granting 
of licenses continue, and that they stop worrying about where 
the supplies are coming from. 
  Delegate Jesus Infante stresses that the problem with decree 
141 is a lack of information among the people and a lack of 
standardized implementation. However, more of a consultation 
process ia required to avoid misinterpretation at the base level. 
  Delegate Rodolfo Serrayonga points out that decree 141 is 
needed, and that its aspects are necessary and useful. The 
problem, however, lies in its implementation and control. 
Regarding messengers, Serrayonga stresses that a clear law 
regulating this service was annulled and replaced by vague 
guidance in decree 141. He adds: "What they have done is to 
regress in the case of the messengers." He goes on to say 
base-level bodies must ensure proper implementation. 
  Delegate Manuel Sanchez Sardina expresses support for decree 
141, but notes that there are some activities not included. 
Sanchez expresses concern with the video-show job, which might 
present an ideological danger, since no regulation exists on 
what can be shown. 
  Alarcon gives the floor to delegate Xiomara Rivero who 
observes that the delegates must consider how the people 
accepted the decree and that like other presidents of People's 
Councils, she was told of the promulgation of the decree by the 
people, and that problems would have been avoided had a broad 
consultation process been conducted. She agrees with previous 
speakers that the base level bodies are responsible for proper 
implementation of the law. 
  Delegate Jasin Chaspar observes that decree 141 is like 
building a train engine without any cars to follow, in this 
case, the inspection corps. He stresses that inspectors also 
need to be supervised, and that there is room for blackmail and 
bribery. He stresses that the People's Councils' role is very 
important. 
  Raul Castro is shown sitting in the assembly. 
  Alarcon introduces Francisco Linares, minister president of 
the State Committee for Labor and Social Security, but gives the 
floor to Delegate Lazaro Barredo who wishes to make a point of 
order. 
  Delegate Barredo states: "Comrade president, I made my 
request to speak on this issue to the floor attendant yesterday 
morning because rather than on a problem of implementation, I 
had prepared an address on several concerns regarding the 
conception of the decree law. I made my request to speak, in 
writing, yesterday morning. I do not know what mechanism has 
violated my human right to speak. I am worried because I truly 
had certain concerns. I had been writing my address since 
yesterday on the conception of the decree, rather than its 
implementation. I would like to ask to be allowed to speak." 
  Alarcon tells Barredo that he himself was not told of 
Barredo's request, and that since Linares had already been given 
the floor, he would speak first, then Barredo could do so. 
  Francisco Linares states that the decree does not establish 
self- employment. Self-employment was established in 1978. The 
decree simply extended the number of approved activities and the 
requisites for those activities. He observes that no other 
legislation has caused as much interest, and that they have 
visited the provinces and talked with the workers. He goes on to 
say that two meetings have been held to analyze the application 
of the decree; that the concerns expressed by the comrades are 
the concerns we have all had. Linares points out, regarding the 
corps of inspectors, that steps have been taken in the provinces 
to establish controls and that this decree is helping to solve 
some of the problems being faced in the country. 
  Linares acknowledges that they did not establish what light 
foods are, and that it was necessary to eliminate this activity 
because many of these restaurants or stands began to appear in 
Havana City. It was decided in a meeting with all the presidents 
of the provincial People's Governments not to grant any more 
permits for this activity. Linares observes that they had to 
stop the taxi service because these taxis had began offering 
their services to tourists, and that was not the idea. 
  Linares stresses that the decree stipulates that the list 
can 
be increased or reduced, and that steps are being taken to 
regulate its implementation. Linares observes that there is no 
need to worry or believe that this will solve all problems, nor 
is it a prelude to capitalism. 
  In the case of messengers, Linares observes that they have 
always existed and that this decree establishes exemption for 
messengers. He believes it is a good idea for messengers to be 
charged a license fee. He concludes by observing the number of 
measures that have been taken. 
  At this point, Politburo member Carlos Lage states that 
they need to continuously examine the responsibilities and 
implementation measures, the scope of consultation and prior 
analysis, before taking a measure on implementation of the 
decree law. He stresses that the issue is complex and that not 
all is related to implementation, but to the issue's complexity 
and how it relates to the country's situation. Lage observes 
that the decree law should be reasonably malleable and that 
changes will be studied to perfect implementation. 
  Lage stresses that the decree represents months of 
consultations and that they were waiting to see how it would 
work in its initial months. Lage points out that the complaints 
stem from lack of control, irregularities in implementation, and 
what is being done in practice, which have nothing to do with 
what was approved. 
  Lage observes that the five jobs suspended were discussed 
and 
analyzed and that he believes there is a consensus on the need 
to approve the decree. 
  Alarcon and Castro discuss the point of order made by Lazaro 
Barredo. Alarcon suggests postponing his comments until after a 
recess. Castro states: "Alarcon, but we did tell him he could 
speak." Raul Castro States: "Yes, we have to fulfill our 
promise." 
  Fidel Castro and Alarcon discuss the intricacies of point of 
order procedures, efforts to keep the agenda's order, but still 
being able to give the floor to Barredo. 
  Barredo states that the two basic pillars of the nation, 
when 
it comes to implementing changes, are independence and social 
justice, adding, "A social justice that does not mean 
egalitarianism or paternalism, but a social justice incompatible 
with forms that go against social ownership. Commander, as you 
mentioned in the Union of Cuban Journalists Congress: Our 
socialism has to be more efficient with state ownership as the 
base, linking responsibility and capability, linking the 
economic sense of control with costs, production, and services; 
all this without rejecting other concepts of social ownership, 
such as the cooperatives in certain sectors and as it is being 
done in certain areas of agriculture." 
  He adds that certain points of decree 141 somehow raise 
doubts on ethical questions. Barredo warns that there is a 
pattern of inappropriate profiteering and illegal resources in 
projects such as this. Barredo stresses that self-employment is 
a vital need, but that in its implementation, there is gray area 
between self- employment and profiteering [meroliquismo]. He 
adds that turning those jobs into cooperatives might have been 
more appropriate, thereby avoiding competition between 
self-employment and state services. Barredo denounces the theft 
of spare parts for use in self-employment repairs. Barredo 
stresses that cooperatives might not make more money, but are a 
good tool to prevent negative trends. 
  Castro asks Barredo what the moral of the story is: "Should 
we approve it or not, reject it or not?" Barredo answers that he 
is not against the decree, that it is important for Cuba, but 
that these issues must be pondered independent of its approval. 
  At this point, Castro addresses the plenary for 90 minutes. 
This material is covered by Fl2912195592 and adds. 
  Following this address, Fidel and Raul discuss removing the 
"etc." from the decree law. Raul asks: "Can this be done? I do 
not believe so. This has to be approved by the assembly. If we 
do not take out the `etc.,' we can agree to take out the `etc.' 
and that is it. Can this be done or not? If it cannot be done, 
do not even invite me to another assembly." Raul says this as he 
abruptly pushes the microphone away. This is followed by 
applause. 
  Alarcon states that it is possible to do so because the 
"etc." only makes things more confusing. Fidel Castro, 
chuckling, states: "Approved the removal of the `etc.' This is 
not a solution, but it should help." 
  Alarcon agrees and takes a vote on all decrees by show of 
hands. The video cuts to closing applause. No figures are given 
on pro or con votes, or abstentions.

  [Editorial Report] Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision 
Networks in Spanish at 0130 GMT on 30 December carry a recording 
of the 28 December evening session of the National Assembly of 
the People's Government [ANPP]. 
  The session is called to order by ANPP President Ricardo 
Alarcon de Quesada who asks the deputies to try to be as brief 
as possible in their presentations and to avoid repetition. 
Alarcon gives the floor to Deputy Zoe de la Cruz who reminds the 
deputies that many of the issues discussed earlier were 
repetitions of issues discussed at provincial assemblies and 
suggests that deputies broach specific rather than overall 
issues. 
  The chair recognizes Pedro Martinez Pirez as the next 
speaker. Martinez Pirez begins by saying that "we must all admit 
that we are responsible for our people's lack of economic 
culture." He continues to speak of the current situation and the 
need to adopt measures that will contribute to solving the 
country's problems. Martinez Pirez recalls that the media has 
been reporting that a "shock policy" would be implemented and 
that "thousands would be unemployed as a result of this." The 
deputy continues to say that "here in Cuba things are not like 
in other countries where policies are not dictated by 
governments and parliaments, but by the IMF." Martinez Pirez 
concludes his presentation by saying that "this ANPP meeting 
should not conclude without some statement on the measures that 
should be taken." The deputy stresses that the ANPP should issue 
a document suggesting the changes that should be made to "save 
the fatherland, save the Revolution, and save the achievements 
of socialism." 
  Castro addresses Ricardo Alarcon: "Alarcon, let us see if we 
can also preserve common sense; it would not be such a bad idea. 
I want to ask you something: Is adopting measures our goal at 
this meeting? Martinez Pirez was talking about a series of 
measures, and I do not know if a series of measures was 
mentioned in the document. I believe that any hope of adopting 
measures prior to the conclusion of this meeting is a bit too 
ambitious. We are practically in diapers on these issues with 
the material we have presented. On various occasions in the 
past, we have at least tried to bring to the attention of our 
comrades that our goal was to think out the problems. We wish to 
think the problems through. We would really be crazy if we 
thought we could adopt measures before the conclusion of this 
meeting that would solve all our problems. 
  "I want to know if everytime something is brought up at this 
meeting, whether we can just comment on it, or do we have to 
wait until 55 deputies speak before we can clarify issues such 
as the ones Martinez Pirez has brought up. He has proposed that 
we adopt a series of measures. Do we have to wait until the 56th 
deputy speaks before we clarify that this is not the purpose of 
this meeting? Do we have to wait until the 56th deputy speaks 
before 60 more speak to clarify these issues?" 
  Ricardo Alarcon says that during the provincial assemblies, 
it was made "very clear" that "the purpose of this session was 
not to adopt measures, but rather to consider, as a group, what 
could be done to solve these problems." 
  Castro continues: "Someone else talked about the need to 
create awareness. I believe that what we are trying to do is 
create an awareness. Others have talked about repeating 24 
February, but what would be our goals? To have a repeat 24 
February, we would need to have an idea of what we want to do. 
There is something else I would like to remind you of. I 
suggested that these issues be discussed at this meeting. It 
would take us three days to adopt measures. All we need to do is 
issue another draft bill with four et ceteras. We would have our 
group of measures. 
  "This is a very sensitive issue. This is not 
self-employment. 
This is something that can affect millions of people. It is of 
high political sensitivity. The ANPP can adopt a series of 
measures. The day the ANPP adopts a series of measures, it will 
say: Ladies and gentlemen, these are the measures we have 
adopted. A series of measures do not all have to be adopted at 
the same time. We are already adopting measures. 
  "There is one thing that yields more than any amount of 
taxes. Some say we must produce; that is fine, we must produce. 
We must produce pants, we must produce textiles. But where is 
the cloth we need, where is the cotton we need? We must produce 
rum, but where is the molasses? We must produce beer, but where 
are the bottles? Where is the barley we need to produce the 
beer? We have a great many great ideas. Produce. Yes we must 
produce, but we must produce what we can produce. We cannot 
produce for the sake of producing. 
  "I was saying that there is something that yields much more 
than anything we have mentioned here. We can eliminate all 
subsidies to the sugar industry and agriculture. Doing this 
would save us 3 billion [currency not specified]. I believe that 
the creation of the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's] 
is one of the good measures. There are others. The Ministry of 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces [Minfar] has cut back its budget 
by 600 million [currency not specified]. These are measures we 
are adopting. 
  "We must adopt a group of measures. We have not taken the 
bull by the horns. We have been discussing the implementation of 
a tax system but no one has told us how much we will receive 
from those taxes. I believe we all wish to make progress, make 
some progress. 
  "We must bring Jose Luis [Jose Luis Rodriguez Garcia, 
minister president of the State Committee for Finance] and 
Osvaldito [not further identified] here and interrogate them -- 
in the positive sense of the word. We want them to help us 
clarify some things. 
  "But the big question is: Do we or do we not seize the 
money? 
That is a big question for you, select deputies, to answer. 
Should we or should we not seize the money? You are talking 
about the people hearing rumors. Many people do not know what to 
do with the money they have. They do not know whether they 
should put it in the bank or dig a 3-meter-deep hole and bury 
it. [laughter] Should we implement a policy where the money is 
not seized? Should we or should we not change the currency? I 
truly would not like to solve that problem here. 
  "Among other things, some of the measures are very complex. 
I 
knew this when I suggested that this issue be broached by the 
ANPP. I will even add that from the very first day this issue 
was brought up at the ANPP, I knew it was going to represent a 
problem. I told the comrades at the National Bank to keep very 
accurate accounts of what happened, from the very day this 
problem was first mentioned. Who had his money in the bank and 
who had it buried? There are many people who have [words 
indistinct]. We cannot assume that those people who do not keep 
their money in the bank have illegal money. There are people in 
the habit of keeping their money at home. That is something 
else. However, many of the illegal street vendors and those 
involved in dirty businesses have money. Many people still 
remember the first exchange of money we made. They still 
remember how it was done. But that is not the issue. 
  "Should we or should we not exchange the money? If we do, 
then we must be intelligent enough to do it publicly. The last 
time we did this, it was a big secret. A tremendous secret. We 
had the money printed in Czechoslovakia, brought it secretly 
into the country, distributed it, and from one day to another, 
the measure was implemented. All measures around the world are 
implemented in this manner. This will be the first time a 
measure is adopted publicly. But how do we go about doing this? 
We must find out. Well, that is one subject we must discuss: 
Should we or should we not change it? 
  "Some deputies have attempted to differentiate between the 
thieves' money and the honest people's money. Ah, if only it 
were marked so that we could tell the difference. [laughter] How 
wonderful that would be. If that were the case, I would 
immediately suggest one measure, not a group of measures, but at 
least one measure: Gentlemen, remove all the money that is 
marked. But money has the same color and shape. We cannot tell 
the difference between one bill and another. 
  "We must decide whether we should or should not seize the 
money; whether we should or should not exchange the money. How 
to do this. We must discuss this publicly. We must decide what 
policy to follow, taking into consideration the fact that we 
have two types of money: honest money and the other kind of 
money. I wonder if anyone involved in finance keeps an inventory 
of the money on the street. This is a decision the ANPP must 
make. It must be very well thought out, discussed. What we 
should do, one way or another. These are key issues. We have 
already heard 17 speeches on this topic. Many of the comrades 
have expressed themselves quite well. We cannot deny that. 
However, we are just going round and round the problem. 
  "We have 10 million [currency not specified]. What do we do 
with that 10 million? I believe this is a key issue. Martinez 
Pirez and other comrades, if we were to begin discussing this, 
it would be quite a discussion. It would be a very big 
discussion. Let the media say whatever it wants to say. That is 
their problem, the foreign press and whatnot. We are not 
discussing dishonest matters. We must not be ashamed of what we 
are talking about. The most patriotic, brave, healthy, honest 
thing is to discuss this. The people will understand this. The 
people will understand the problems if we explain it to them 
clearly and make them part of our concerns. 
  "A technocratic approach cannot be used to solve these 
problems. We must not think that technical measures will solve 
the problems. We must not forget that in this country, honor, 
patriotism, the sense of dignity and duty of the worker is 
expressed. We encourage the worker to express himself. If we did 
not, no problem could be solved. If tomorrow we were to decide 
to take all the money out of circulation, it would not mean that 
on the day after tomorrow, all the workers would show up for 
work. If everyone were to show up for work the day after 
tomorrow, we would not have enough room for them in our 
factories. The workers do not have raw materials, electricity, 
responsibilities, or workshops. Ours is a complex situation. But 
if we cannot count on the support of the workers who do have a 
job and a workshop to go to, then we cannot solve our problems. 
If we did something without the workers' support, it would be a 
political blunder. 
  "At this meeting, I have not heard a single word from anyone 
appealing to the patriotism and honor of the worker. A few days 
ago, I said that most of the people in this country are working 
out of a sense of honor. Only their sense of honor makes them 
wake up at the hour they must wake up and find whatever means 
they can -- bicycle or whatever -- to go to work and fulfill 
their duty. They do not do it for money. We know that there is 
very little they can buy with what we pay them. They can only 
buy a few things at the grocery store because there are only a 
few things to sell, even if they are sold cheap. There is very 
little they can buy on the black market because they do not earn 
enough money to buy on the black market. 
  "If we cannot count on the patriotism and honor of the 
people and their determination to do whatever [words indistinct] 
the Revolution, all technical measures we adopt will be useless. 
We may solve a problem today, but confront complications two, 
three, or four months later. Therefore, we cannot forget the 
people. We must never forget that we must keep the people 
informed. I understand hope; however, I cannot understand the 
need to conclude this meeting with an approved group of 
measures. I believe the people's curiosity can be satisfied if 
we make all that we have discussed here available to the public. 
This is what we are doing. Members of the ANPP are not the only 
ones in this hall. There are many witnesses here. The media is 
here. 
  "This is the first time the ANPP is discussing problems as 
complex as these. If we wish to see positive results, then we 
should utilize what time we have left to discuss the heart of 
the problem. This is what I am proposing, so that we do not have 
to sit through 25 speeches. I suggest that we invite our two 
comrades, Osvaldito because he is president of the Institute of 
Economic Research -- he spoke here and expressed himself quite 
nicely; others did as well, but he is an expert on this matter 
-- and Jose Luis. Jose Luis is an expert on this matter and is 
knowledgeable. Let us begin broaching specific issues. 
  "What is our budget? Jose Luis gave us some information, but 
let him expand on this matter. How much revenue would we receive 
from taxes? What kind of taxes should we implement? Will taxes 
solve the problem? How much do we pay out in social security 
benefits, wages, and other benefits? Is this a shock policy? 
Should we lower wages and social security benefits? Should we 
have cutbacks? Should we continue as we are? What should be 
taxed? Should we implement a tax system? How much tax should we 
charge? What measures should we implement? What policies should 
we implement? This is what we should be discussing if we really 
want to make progress. We must grab the bull by the horns. You 
cannot grab a radish by its leaves. 
  "If everyone agrees, and we are not saying that no one else 
can speak, I would suggest a start on this. I know many of you 
cannot improvise a speech on specific issues... How many people 
are scheduled to speak? 
  Alarcon answers: "Twenty." 
  Castro: "Twenty or 22, and more to come. They grow faster 
than money. [laughter] I suggest we speak in front of witnesses 
and that we discuss what is proposed. [laughter] I should have 
added that the discussion be held with specialists on the 
subject. Let us discuss the issues and make some progress. 
However, we must do this knowing that we are not going to reach 
any agreements today. We must all think. You must think and the 
people must think. After you have thought, then we will talk. 
The people are aware of the problems we are confronting. Someone 
conducted a poll: Everyone understands what is going on, but 
practically no one agrees with the measures. If we do not get 
the people to understand the problem and accept the measures, 
then we have achieved nothing. It will be another draft bill 
with 17 et ceteras. Let us do something and extract something 
positive from these discussions. This is something new for us, 
something we have never done before. It is a complex situation, 
but we are deputies and we were elected to broach issues such as 
these. We were elected to confront the serious problems. The 
people may not elect us again after this. By the way, Alarcon, 
we do not get paid that much. The people can retire all of us." 
  Ricardo Alarcon invites Jose Luis Rodriguez to take the 
floor. 
  Rodriguez greets the assembly, then says: "I will go 
directly 
to the heart of the matter: As we said earlier, we believe this 
financial imbalance the country is experiencing is not a problem 
that can be solved effectively by a group of technicians or by 
the most brilliant group of economists. We agree that it is a 
big problem and has repercussions on our country and the 
Revolution. We also agree that it is essentially a political 
problem. Therefore, anything that is done must be evaluated 
according to [words indistinct] can be applied. We must evaluate 
our situation prior to implementing one measure or another. 
  "As has been explained in the past, there is an excess of 
money on the streets. One of the key elements that contributes 
to increasing the excess currency, and the commander in chief 
mentioned it yesterday and today, is the deficit of the state 
budget. Our deficit has been increasing for the past few years. 
The reasons for this have been explained in the past. This 
deficit has been increasing since 1989. According to the report 
we have already presented, our deficit in 1989 was 1.4 billion 
[currency not specified]. It increased to 1.958 billion in 1990, 
and in 1991, it jumped to more than 3.7 billion. Then in 1992, a 
record year for us, it went up to 4.869 billion, and this year, 
1993, it should be a bit lower. The report says that we will be 
ending the year with a 4.2 billion deficit. 
  "We do not believe the measures adopted contributed to 
reducing this year's deficit. The drop is the result of certain 
economic activities undertaken by the country. 
  "Now, regarding the deficit: In the past we had several 
sources that helped cover the deficit. One source was the loans 
the country got from abroad. We do not have to tell you that 
these are no longer available. We also had the money we could 
collect domestically, and we could cover the deficit by issuing 
more money. In the past few years, most of the deficit was 
covered by issuing money domestically. We have been issuing 
money at a rate of approximately 60 percent. 
  "What is the first thing we learn from this? As far as we 
are 
concerned, this is very important. If we do not adopt measures 
to reduce the deficit, the excess money on the streets is going 
to increase. The deficit automatically contributes to the excess 
of money. Therefore, the first thing we should do is study the 
possibilities of reducing the state's budget deficit. 
  "We must then say, and we mentioned it today when we 
reported 
to the ANPP, that contrary to what some comrades believe, the 
health, education, and not even social security benefits -- and 
these have shot up in the past few years, these benefits are 
currently in the amount of 1.5 billion pesos -- do not 
contribute to increasing our deficit. These three expenses are 
only 30 percent of the expenses included in the budget. If 
tomorrow we were to decide to reduce these expenses, we would 
only be reducing 30 percent of the budget. This, of course, is 
only a theory because we cannot make these cuts and we will not 
make these cuts. 
  "For example, health and education: 75 percent of what we 
spend on health and education falls under the category of wages. 
We are working on reducing other expenditures. However, because 
of our country's wage policy, these have not been touched. This 
means that we are restricted to making cuts in vital areas 
because we cannot touch the work force. I must honesty say that 
we, for political, social, and economic reasons, do not agree 
that these expenditures should be cut substantially because it 
will not be here where we will find the appropriate solutions." 
  Rodriguez continues to mention the various areas where, 
according to some, cuts can be made. Rodriguez adds that these 
cuts would not make much of a difference. Rodriguez continues to 
mention some of the areas the government could exploit and 
receive revenue. Parents who want their children to learn to 
swim or receive special courses in gymnastics can pay for these 
services. These areas would represent approximately 55 million 
pesos in revenue for the country. 
  Rodriguez states: "Where does the country spend most of its 
money? We studied this situation and reached the following 
conclusion: The country spends its largest amount of money 
subsidizing the sugar industry and agriculture. During the three 
years of the special period, 1991, 1992, and 1993, the 
government has contributed 7.231 billion pesos in these two 
areas. This represents 54 percent of the deficit in those years. 
As you said earlier, we must work on this. And we see 
possibilities." 
  Castro interjects: "That is a key point." 
  Rodriguez responds: "It is a key point." 
  Castro again: "That is a key point." 
  Rodriguez again: "It is." 
  Castro then says: "From the view of what we are discussing, 
the issue of subsidies is a key point." 
  Rodriguez responds: "Yes it is. Furthermore, when drafting 
the 1994 budget we not only concentrated on subsidies but also 
on the financial situation of our state enterprises. Osvaldo 
mentioned this in his report. 
  "Commander, we have a noticeable lack of discipline where 
payments are concerned. Our report is through September 1993. 
When we studied the business sector alone, and we are not 
including the area included in the budget, we found that the 
state owes the state 2.821 billion pesos. In other words, these 
are amounts that one enterprise owes the other but they do not 
pay." 
  Castro asks: "And this affects the budget?" 
  Rodriguez answers: "Yes it does, and it also represents a 
loss." 
  Castro asserts: "It may represent a loss but it does not 
directly influence the excess of money on the streets." 
  Rodriguez responds: "No." 
  And Castro asks: "But they report this as a loss?" 
  Rodriguez answers yes: "Yes. They write it off as a bad 
debt. 
These bad debts must be subsidized and the subsidies affect the 
deficit." 
  Castro remarks: "Now you are talking about subsidies. That 
is 
included in the 7 billion you were talking about." 
  Rodriguez says: "Yes. It is an important element. The 
problem 
here is not only an economic...." 
  Castro, interrupts: "It is a problem of education as well?" 
  Rodriguez states: "Not only that. From the social viewpoint 
this is very important. We have started to dig and this is one 
of the things that contributes to the shifting of large amounts 
of money. This is an example of the lack of economic control we 
were talking about earlier. 
  "Since we are on the topic of shifting of large amounts of 
money I will say that this is one of the [words indistinct]. If 
you write and bill for services, but do not get paid for the 
services bill, and the person who receives does not know what he 
is receiving, does not know what he is supposed to pay, and does 
not pay, then its havoc. And we are talking 2.8 billion." 
  Castro asks: "In how many months?" 
  Rodriguez responds: "Through 30 September. We have yet to 
end 
this year." 
  Castro again: "In one year?" 
  Rodriguez: "We do not have a breakdown because these 
accounts 
go back a long time." 
  Castro again: "You are talking 7 billion in three years. 
What 
about the 2.8 billion?" 
  Rodriguez: "We have bills dated 60 days, 90 days, and we may 
even find some a year old." 
  Castro: "A year old. Everyone should close the year by the 
end of the year. Will the amount increase by the end of the 
year?" 
  Rodriguez: "We believe it will. It will increase because we 
have not been able to create an awareness regarding the need to 
collect due bills. We are beginning to meet with the biggest 
enterprises, with their directors, to make them understand the 
importance of this and explain to them that we cannot subsidize 
them when they have these huge amounts owed them. How can we 
give money out of the budget to enterprises that do not collect 
their bills." 
  Castro says: "Give us some examples." 
  Rodriguez: "What?" 
  Castro: "Give us some examples." 
  Rodriguez answers: "I will. For example, the Ministry of 
Basic Industry [Minbas]. I have brought this up because the 
other day we met with Marquitos [Minbas Minister Marcos J. 
Portal] and brought this up." 
  Castro: "How much is the Minbas owed?" 
  Rodriguez: "They are owed 556 million through 30 September." 
  Castro: "Who owes them?" 
  Rodriguez: "The Minbas oil sector is owed 556 million." 
  Castro: "Who owes them that amount?" 
  Rodriguez: "Basically, the retailers." 
  Castro: "The retailers fall under the people's government, 
do 
they not?" 
  Rodriguez: "Most of them." 
  Castro: "So who pays?" 
  Rodriguez: "This is something we caught only recently. We 
are 
making a file and then we will visit all those enterprises to 
discuss the bills they owe and are owed, those that must be 
written off because they are already too old, and which of them 
can still be paid." 
  Castro observes: "Now this money can increase that excess 
money on the streets. " 
  Rodriguez: "Yes it can." 
  Castro: "If that money is stolen, where will it go?" 
  Rodriguez: "That is anyone's guess. It can be used for many 
other things. The fact that you do not pay does not mean that 
you do not spend. You may spend on other things. Money is 
shifted from one source to another and you do not pay what you 
have to pay. " 
  Castro: "[Words indistinct] for example." 
  Rodriguez: "Yes, of course. We find that the foreign trade 
sector has 835 million owed them." 
  Castro: "And they are not being paid?" 
  Rodriguez: "No, they are not being paid. The import 
enterprises [words indistinct]." 
  Castro: "Why do they not pay?" 
  Rodriguez: "It seems we have a problem with operations. The 
enterprises that import the merchandise are not the ones that 
handle the merchandise. It seems that the billing and collecting 
mechanism is not working as it should. The enterprise scheduled 
to receive the merchandise takes it from the port and there is 
no control by the foreign trade officials. This seems to be the 
problem. We have yet to determine what the problem is. But they 
are owed much money. 
  "Commander, we also have the bills to be paid in foreign 
exchange. I would not like to go into this because we are still 
investigating, but let me tell you that this involves hundreds 
of millions. We are not talking 10 or 20 million. A purge is 
necessary before we can give you...." 
  Castro, interuppting, asks: "What is the problem? Tourism?" 
  Rodriguez responds: "Part of the problem has to do with the 
tourist sector." 
  Castro observes:: "We know that some of the tourist 
enterprises hold back payments. They are billed in November and 
they pay in January. We have to fight to get them to pay. 
  "Are we owed for our exports?" 
  Rodriguez: "Yes, we are. The Ministry of the Fishing 
Industry 
is a good example of this." 
  Castro: "This means that they export and do not get paid." 
  Rodriguez: "We have a problem with our collection cycle. We 
have to find out why it takes so long for us to be able to 
collect what is owed us. We have money invested there that we 
cannot move." 
  Castro observes: "This has to do with international ways of 
doing things. Many pay every three months or every six months. 
We have to check and see what has been paid and what has not 
been paid." 
  Rodriguez states: "That is correct. But that is money the 
country has to recover. We do not know how much it is, but what 
we are sure of is that we cannot continue to live like this. We 
must be able to use that money. We must get them to pay what 
they owe." 
  Castro: "We also owe, do we not? 
  Rodriguez: "Yes we do, but we have to pay. If we do not pay 
we cannot buy, and our meager imports will drop. 
  "In other words, at this very moment, we are working on a 
mechanism, a sole mechanism, to determine where all this money 
is, and why it is not where it should be. This mechanism will 
help the state do what it must do." 
  Castro asks: "Let us go back to the excess of currency in 
the 
country." 
  Rodriguez: "We are talking about the deficit, and all those 
factors I mentioned contribute to increasing the deficit. The 
deficit is covered by issuing money, and this measure puts a 
certain amount of money into circulation each year. If we can 
reduce the deficit by tackling the problem that increases it, 
then we do not have to issue that much money next year. This 
would contribute to strengthening the country's economic policy. 
If this is possible, we would avoid issuing a large amount of 
money." 
  Castro comments: "It looks as if the greatest amount of 
money 
goes into subsidies." 
  Rodriguez: "And there is a good possibility we can lower 
those subsidies." 
  Castro: "Continue." 
  Rodriguez adds: "Commander, in addition to this. I must say 
that solving these problems alone will not help us gradually 
reduce the amount of excess money on the streets. You asked 
about taxes. We responsibly tell you that we are proposing a tax 
system for the country. We have already talked about the need to 
create an awareness among the people, an awareness that we have 
lost...." 
  Castro interrupts: "No, no, no. We never had that awareness. 
The other tax system was a bourgeois tax system." 
  Rodriguez: "We did have a sort of tax system. That is why I 
mentioned it." 
  Castro: "We paid a direct tax on income?" 
  Rodriguez: "We did, through 1967. We paid 11.9 percent in 
taxes on our wages." 
  Castro: "That was for social security?" 
  Rodriguez: "No. We also had a 4-percent industrial tax and 
other taxes. This system was abolished in 1967 and we have not 
had a tax system since." 
  Castro: "By then, we were owners of our economy." 
  Rodriguez: "Yes." 
  Castro continues: "We had replaced the capitalists who owned 
the industries and other economic sources. So we did have a tax, 
but this was a relative tax system. So we paid 11 percent." 
  Rodriguez: "No, 11.90 percent." 
  Castro: "Wages were taxed." 
  Rodriguez: "That is correct; it was deducted by payroll." 
  Castro asks: "Until what year?" 
  Rodriguez: "Until 1967. That same year, 1967...." 
  Castro interrupts: "How much would that 11 percent represent 
today?" 
  Rodriguez: "We are paying approximately 8.800 billion pesos 
in wages each year, so that would represent...." 
  Castro interrupts: "That would be 900 million." 
  Rodriguez: "Yes, approximately 900 million. This is a 
problem 
we must discuss because you know what it would be like suddenly 
imposing a tax system on the people. We have told ourselves that 
we are going to study this issue carefully and see what we can 
do to introduce an income tax system to the country. We cannot 
implement this measure without preparation. That is the way we 
see it. This means that...." 
  Castro: "Which would be more profitable, to establish an 
income-tax system or a progressive tax on income?" 
  Rodriguez: "That would have to be studied. Even though we 
have workers who are earning large salaries, they are not a 
majority. For example, through last year, 65 percent of the 
families had a monthly per capita income of 100 pesos. This 
means that only 35 percent earn more than 100 pesos a month. We 
are considering a family nucleus to be approximately 3.5 people. 
In other words, they are not a majority. 
  Castro: "What kind of taxes have you been thinking about?" 
  Rodriguez answers: "We have been thinking about income tax 
and business tax. Some taxes are currently being paid. The 
self-employed are being taxed." 
  Castro: "How much revenue can we collect from the tax the 
self-employed is paying?" 
  Rodriguez: "The self-employed are currently paying 49.90 
percent, and 90 percent of the self-employed are paying their 
taxes -- but the system was only implemented two months ago, so 
we have to wait a while longer to see if they continue to do it. 
According to our estimates, next year we should be receiving 
approximately 126 million pesos; that is, if we do not raise 
taxes. If we raise taxes, we can receive more. We believe taxes 
should be raised. Only two provinces, Las Tunas and Cienfuego, 
have raised their taxes. Today we learned that Pinar del Rio is 
also working on this. However, we have not implemented the 
resolution on a basic minimum tax which was discussed here this 
morning. The other day we were telling the presidents...." 
  Castro interrupts: "Do you support the idea that other 
products and services must be taxed, or only income?" 
  Rodriguez: "We believe that we should implement a 
progressive 
tax on income system. This calls for one specific mechanism." 
  Castro: "What is that?" 
  Rodriguez: "The filing of an income tax return." 
  Castro then asks: "Have you thought about this?" 
  Rodriguez: "Yes we have, commander, but...." 
  Castro interrupts: "Rest assured I did not steal your idea. 
I 
also suggested that." 
  Rodriguez: "Commander, the problem is that...." 
  Castro interrupts: "And what happens to the person who tries 
to evade filing the return?" 
  Rodriguez: "If I am not mistaken, he will be fined 500 
pesos." 
  Castro: "Is that all?" 
  Rodriguez: "That is for first-time offenders. Seizures and 
other punishments are also being considered." 
  Castro: "Have other types of punishments been established?" 
  Rodriguez: "Other types of punishments have been suggested. 
The problem is that...." 
  Castro interrupts: "You are talking about petty fines. If 
you 
read our penal and civil codes, you will see that the fines are 
ridiculous. They were established when the peso was worth 
something. Today, anyone who legally earns 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 
pesos, or makes 10,000 illegally, does not care at all if he 
must pay that amount in fines. I understand that many of those 
so-called countries have strong punishments for tax evaders." 
  Rodriguez: "Tax evasion can entail eight to 10 years in 
jail. 
Let me tell you something else...." 
  Castro interrupts: "The people will only file a return if 
they know that if they fail to do so they will go to jail." 
  Rodriguez: "We are now asking that tax evasion be considered 
a crime. This was abolished in 1967. We are suggesting jail 
sentences for evaders." 
  Castro: "There was no need for this because we did not have 
a 
tax system." 
  Rodriguez: "That is correct, but if we are going to 
implement 
a tax system today, then we must establish that tax evasion is a 
crime." 
  Castro: "I am just asking. For the people to pay and respect 
the tax system, it is necessary to establish some type of 
punishment. This must include jail; otherwise, we will have 
evaders. An income tax return is an instrument to collect taxes 
should you one day implement the progressive income tax." 
  Rodriguez: "We are suggesting both: fines and jail 
sentences. 
We are also suggesting confiscation of the produced goods and 
the means of production." 
  Castro: "That is nothing. Anyone would say that you are 
thinking of a car factory and that you are going to seize the 
factory. Right now, all you would seize would be a stand or a 
coach." 
  Rodriguez: "Perhaps." 
  Castro: "It would not take these people 10 days to set up 
another stand and coach." 
  Rodriguez: "It is not that cheap to do, Commander." 
  Castro: "With the money they have, they can do it. How much 
does a coach cost today?" 
  Rodriguez: "That depends on the type of coach. There are 
coaches that cost 10,000 pesos." 
  Castro: "That would be a [word indistinct]." 
  Rodriguez: "No, no, no. The usual coach. There are comrades 
from the provinces who have more up-to-date information on that." 
  Castro: "Great, they will have paid it off in three months. 
But there are others who do not have stands or coaches and have 
many ways of making much money." 
  Rodriguez: "We are working on another idea, commander." 
  Castro: "What are you going to seize from a messenger? His 
feet?" 
  Rodriguez: "We will have to think of other types of 
punishment." 
  Castro: "What?" 
  Rodriguez: "We must think of other types of punishment." 
  Castro: "Seizing property may be of some value, but I do not 
think it will work. If you are going to implement a progressive 
income tax system for the self-employed, and want the system 
respected and the tax paid, you need to do more than just file 
an income tax return. You need strict punishment for evasion. 
There are laws for this in the United States and in Europe. If 
they did not have them, people would not pay their taxes. These 
mechanisms must be accompanied by others." 
  Rodriguez: "We are studying those proposals. We are being 
careful to ensure that the control system will not be more 
expensive than what we are going to control." 
  Castro: "You have just proven that no matter how much you 
do, 
you will only collect some 200 million in taxes [words 
indistinct]. Now if we were to implement a general income tax, 
like the 11- percent you were talking about, the state would 
receive much more, right?" 
  Rodriguez: "Yes." 
  Castro: "It is a lot easier to collect that tax." 
  Rodriguez: "All you have to do is deduct the tax from the 
workers' pay." 
  Castro: "And that represents approximately 800 or 900 
million. That is something. So what other taxes are we talking 
about?" 
  Rodriguez: "Of those that directly affect the people, the 
ones we have mentioned are the most important at this time. We 
are studying taxing other areas, but they do not affect the 
people, at least not directly. We are studying the possibility 
of taxing several products, especially cigarettes and alcoholic 
beverages." 
  Castro: "Since this has been brought up here, I want all of 
you to know that in 1970, we established a tax on nonessential 
products. We solved that famous budget deficit and the excess of 
money on the streets. It was that tax that did it. However, 
there is something different that has not been mentioned here. 
  "Back then, we had an excess of money on the streets, but we 
did not have that scarcity of merchandise we are experiencing 
today. Today we have both things: excess money and a tremendous 
scarcity of merchandise. [Words indistinct] deficit, but we had 
things to buy. We had more than enough money, but we had things 
we could purchase." 
  Rodriguez: "And we could import goods." 
  Castro: "The tax on cigarettes and alcoholic beverages 
basically solved the deficit." 
  Rodriguez: "This year we should be able to collect some 
3.300 
billion in taxes on those products. However, we need 600 million 
more to cover the deficit. This is basically due to the problems 
that we have had with production." 
  Castro: "We do not have cigarettes, rum, beer. This effects 
us. Back in 1970, we had enough beer and cigarettes to satisfy 
the demand. There is a strong demand for those items. I recall 
that in 1970, a spontaneous sort of dry law was established. 
This was because some factories stopped producing. Today we do 
not have cigarettes. We do not have the raw materials or 
electricity to produce cigarettes. All that. Continue." 
  Rodriguez continues: "That is all for taxes. In this initial 
phase, aimed at removing the excess money from the streets, we 
do not believe that the tax system would be a significant means 
of removing that excess money. It would be helpful to the 
economy. The tax is not only for people, but for the 
enterprises, including the mixed enterprises. We have other 
sources, but these are not directly related to the excess money 
in the hands of the people. 
  "Now, about the excess money: You asked a question about 
measures that should be implemented in regard to seizure or 
exchange of money. I will now tell you what I know about this. I 
believe we...." 
  Castro: "Let us take a break here." 
  Rodriguez: "What?" 
  Castro: "Let us take a break." 
  Rodriguez: "If you want to." 
  Castro: "Let us ask the deputies what they think. Let them 
tell us their views before you give us yours." 
  Rodriguez: "About what?" 
  Castro: "Seizure of money; we want to hear some ideas 
without 
putting this matter to a vote. Also ideas about the exchange of 
money. Ideas as to whether we should give up some of these ideas 
if your mechanisms do not solve the problem." 
  At 0250 GMT Ricardo Alarcon is heard to say that there are 
several deputies who wish to express their views on the subject. 
The first deputy to speak is Leonel Gonzalez from Cabaiguan 
Municipality. Castro immediately interrupts him to ask: "How 
many of you have thought this problem out? How many of you have 
discussed this problem among yourselves? Be honest and raise 
your hands. Fine. Those of you who have not thought about this, 
raise your hands. This does not mean that you agree with the 
measures. Just if you have thought about this. We cannot ask you 
to give your opinion; all we want to know is who has thought 
about this problem and discussed it. Fine. Continue, comrade." 
  Gonzalez begins to speak about the exchange of money. Castro 
interrupts to ask: "First of all, in your opinion, what is an 
exchange?" Gonzalez continues to explain what he thinks an 
exchange is and what he believes should be done. Gonzalez 
suggests that the government freeze the money that is in the 
bank, to which Castro responds: "The money that is in the bank 
does not affect the phenomenon created by the excess of money on 
the streets. We have launched campaigns for people to save money 
in the bank. If a man earned 100,000 pesos and put it in the 
bank, he is not in the least affecting the situation. The 
problem is the person who has 100,000 pesos and is spending it 
on the black market; buying cheaper and selling for a profit. We 
promote savings. It keeps the money off the street. Inflation 
and trouble are caused by the money on the streets, not the 
money that is saved. Many countries encourage their citizens to 
save as a means to keep inflation down. Let us call the excess 
of money an inflationary phenomenon. This would happen here if 
we did not have the ration book for certain articles, if there 
were free sales. But, you are just expressing your views. As far 
as you are concerned, you would put a freeze on excess money." 
  Gonzalez continues to express his views. Next, Ricardo 
Alarcon recognizes Ramon Fernandez as the next speaker. 
Fernandez mentions the fact that there are too many workers in 
certain sectors and suggests that the excess manpower be put to 
work in other areas or on the land to produce food, to which 
Castro replies: "Then we start running out of land and we 
transfer them to Guira de Melena and there are too many people 
already in Guira de Melena. For the first time, and only since 
the creation of the UPBC, are we finding that some of these 
agricultural enterprises are admitting that they have too many 
workers. What do we do with the excess manpower?" 
  Fernandez admits to Castro that this is a challenge. Castro 
asks: "What kind of a challenge -- to a sword fight, to a 
shootout?" Fernandez adds that for these cases, the government 
has implemented a system to protect laid-off workers. 
  The chair then recognizes Tomas Pagan who also presents his 
views on the exchange of money and comments on Jose Luis 
Rodriguez' statement on outstanding debts among the various 
state enterprises. Castro interrupts to ask Rodriguez: "We have 
mentioned the worrisome issue of the outstanding debts among the 
enterprises. Are these outstanding debts included in the 7 
billion utilized to subsidize various sectors? We are not very 
clear on this. What happens to that money? It is said that it 
could be a source for shifting of money from one place to 
another as well as other things. What is clear is that we must 
cover those 7 billion and that this represents 54 percent of the 
deficit. These outstanding debts, as far as I understood, 
represent losses for the state. When does this represent a loss? 
Can you tell us how much of those losses have unavoidably been 
covered by the budget? It would be nice to know how much; 
whether it is 800, 500, 900 million or 1 billion." 
  Rodriguez: "We are looking into this. The problem is that we 
have not been able to...." 
  Castro interrupts: "When we speak of approximately 3 billion 
in subsidies to the Ministry of the Sugar Industry [Minaz] and 
the agriculture sector are we talking only subsidies?" 
  Rodriguez: "Subsidies." 
  Castro: "Is this based on bills that must be collected?" 
  Rodriguez: "Some of it could." 
  Castro: "Some of it?." 
  Rodriguez: "Some of it." 
  Castro says: "You mentioned 7 billion in three years." 
  Rodriguez: "Yes." 
  Castro: "But a few days ago the Minaz and Agriculture 
ministers told us that those two areas received 3 billion in 
subsidies. What would happen if we cut off all subsidies?" 
  Rodriguez: "Commander, I will answer that for you. A few 
days 
ago we made up a list of the enterprises that are making no 
profit. If you should cut off subsidies to those enterprises, 
you would be cutting off subsidies to 69 percent of the 
enterprises in the country; 31 percent of our enterprises are 
profit-making and 69 percent make no profit." 
  Castro: "In other words, we would lose those enterprises. We 
would have to close them." 
  Rodriguez: "Well, we either close them or do something else. 
However, if their subsidies are cut, they would not have the 
money to operate." 
  Castro: "We would have to close the 158 sugar mills. They 
fall under that category. The sugar mills are not making 
profits. Can we close them? What should we do? What happens if 
we close our 158 sugar mills?" 
  Rodriguez: "We cannot do that. What we should do is...." 
  Castro interrupts: "What happens if we close the Moa and 
Nicaro mines?" 
  Rodriguez: "You do not have to do that, but we could do what 
was done this year. You can stop the operations when it is not 
profitable to produce for export purposes." 
  Castro: "Of course, when it is not profitable, but the 
workers are getting paid." 
  Rodriguez: "Exactly." 
  Castro: "And you have to find the money to pay the workers." 
  Rodriguez: "That is correct. That case is perfectly 
justified. The only subsidies that are not justified are those 
allocated to poorly managed areas. Those are the areas we must 
pinpoint here." 
  Castro: "Yet I believe that the measures adopted in the area 
of agriculture will considerably reduce subsidies to that area." 
  Rodriguez: "Correct." 
  Castro continues: "Perhaps even more than all you can 
collect 
in taxes." 
  Rodriguez: "Probably." 
  Castro: "Now tell me, of the subsidies allocated for the 
sugar industry how much goes to the sugar mills and how much 
goes to the agriculture sector." 
  Rodriguez: "This year the agriculture...." 
  Castro interrupts: "The sugar cane agriculture." 
  Rodriguez: "In 1994 we are allocating approximately 300 
million in subsidies." 
  Castro: "And the sugar mills?" 
  Rodriguez: "The sugar mills will be receiving approximately 
400 million." 
  Minaz Minister Juan Ramon Herrera: "In the past, the sugar 
cane agricultural sector received 600 million. With the [words 
indistinct] we had calculated 600 million for the sugar cane 
agriculture. Approximately 400 million are to be allocated to 
the sugar industry; that involves all the sugar activities." 
  Castro: "Only a few days ago you told me that subsidies to 
your area were in the amount of 1.2 billion." 
  Herrera: "No, it is 1.002 billion." 
  Castro: "One billion plus 2 million?" 
  Herrera: "That is correct. Not 1.2 billion but 1.002 
billion." 
  Castro: "And what about the agriculture sector." 
  Rodriguez: "We have estimated we will allocate this year 
approximately 300 million to the sugar cane UBPC." 
  Castro: "By this year do you mean 1993?" 
  Rodriguez: "No. We do not have the Minaz' 1993 breakdown for 
the agricultural sector." 
  Herrera: "Minaz will close 1993 with 1.7 billion." 
  Castro continues: "You will close with 1.7 billion. And how 
much did you allocate for 1994?" 
  Rodriguez: "We suggested a reduction for 1994. We suggested 
reducing subsidies to the sugar industry, Agriculture Ministry, 
and UBPC by 800 million." 
  Castro: "You have already included this in the budget?" 
  Rodriguez: "Yes." 
  Castro: "You included the reduction in the 1994 budget?" 
  Rodriguez: "Yes, we have." 
  Castro: "That is an adopted measure." 
  Rodriguez: "Yes, it is." 
  Castro: "Is it the measure or one of the measures?" 
  Rodriguez: "One of the measures." 
  Castro: "Right. Alarcon, this is very interesting. The 
comrades are talking among themselves about what is being said. 
[laughter] Listen to them, they are talking." [laughter] 
  Ricardo Alarcon recognizes Deputy Agustin Delgado who once 
again broaches the issue of exchange and his opinion of how this 
problem can be solved. He asks whether anyone knows how much 
excess money is out on the streets. He believes the "enemy of 
the Revolution" is encouraging the people to refrain from 
putting the money in the bank, thus undermining the Revolution. 
Delgado stresses his trust in the economists to which Castro 
says: "You do, but I do not. [laughter] Economists frighten me. 
There is only one thing I know a little about and that is 
politics. That has been my job, the most important job I have 
had. I believe that things must be viewed through politics. The 
ideas presented by the specialists must be analyzed from a 
political viewpoint. Our best economists are those who can 
suggest and draft measures with a political meaning. If they are 
going to propose something that technically may be good, but 
politically catastrophic, our mission and duty is to stop them 
and reject what they are proposing. We must combine economy and 
policy. 
  "I would like to say as well that I know peasants who have 
never sold a single pound of their products on the black market 
and have hundreds of thousands of pesos in the bank." 
  Delgado: "Commander, but if...." 
  Castro interrupts: "I know some. Great people." 
  Delgado: "But commander...." 
  Castro: "Not all peasants are like that. For the past 20 or 
25 years they have been harvesting tubers, vegetables, and 
potatoes. They are self-sufficient and do not have too many 
expenses. These are the people who make you stop and think. I 
wish that peasant's money had a little mark on it. There are 
some who have much money but who did not earn that money 
legally. They got the money through manipulations and the black 
market. 
  "Now regarding those of you who are advising others to save 
or not to save, I will say nothing about that. I will not take 
sides." 
  Delgado: "Excuse me commander, if that honest peasant...." 
  Castro: " If we are going to adopt measures, we must not 
overlook your suggestions and opinions. That would not be 
correct. I truly believe we should adopt measures, but we have 
not reached a final decision. We have not covered every single 
angle. However, we are very interested in knowing what you think 
about this. It is necessary that we know how each of you feel 
because this helps us reach a decision on what measures to 
adopt. This helps create an awareness. 
  "It is quite obvious that once this meeting has concluded we 
will leave this meeting place with much more information, a 
clearer view of the problem. We will know more about the problem 
than we did when we walked into this hall this morning." 
  Delgado: "That is correct and this is why...." 
  Castro: "This is why it is important that we know how you 
think. However, I also believe that it is too soon for us to 
commit ourselves. However, it is extremely valuable to learn how 
you think. 
  "There is something the people believe in and they are not 
mistaken in doing so. Above all, the Revolution will protect the 
interests of the people. That will always come first. The 
Revolution will leave no one unattended. This is an 
unquestionable principle." [applause] 
  Ricardo Alarcon then gives the floor to Deputy Marcia 
Febles, 
Trinidad Municipality, Sancti Spiritus Province. Febles reports 
on developments in her area and her views on the exchange. The 
chair then recognizes Deputy Raul Gomez Cabrera, who also 
expresses his views on the exchange of currency. 
  The chair recognizes Deputies Hector Rodriguez Almaral and 
Luis Oscar Galvez, who also express their views on the topics 
broached, in particular the seizure or exchange of money. 
  Castro then says: "I wish to clarify something. I brought up 
the issue of seizing money. In 1961 we seized the money in the 
country and we seized the money of the bourgeoisie. They did not 
have their money in the banks. Back in 1961 we did not touch the 
money in the banks; we only seized some of the money, not all of 
it. I talked about this and exchange because they are two of an 
arsenal of measures that could be adopted. I also talked about 
taxes. I wanted to find out about taxes, how much these taxes 
would yield, how much tax the people would have to pay, how much 
we would save if the people had to pay for school uniforms, if 
we did not pay for plastic surgery operations, and if we did not 
cover the costs of the special schools for girls interested in 
taking classes in gymnastics. I do not know how the National 
Institute for Sports feels about all this. Perhaps we should 
hear what they have to say about this, about their schools. I 
imagine they have their own schools, just as the music sector 
does. 
  "We wanted to be specific; however, since this is one of 
the most touchy topics in this arsenal of possible measures, we 
wanted to discuss it. It is an important topic and we have been 
[words indistinct]. 
  "You have said something that is true. No country announces 
currency exchanges; no country announces devaluations. No 
parliament in the world discusses problems of this nature. I 
believe this is the only parliament in the world where issues 
such as these are discussed, as we are doing. We are discussing 
the issue in front of you, the world, and the press. One must 
have courage to do something like this. We can do it. But the 
fact that we can do it does not mean that we will not do it. If 
we wanted to, we could announce a currency exchange tomorrow. 
There are ways to do this. We could do it tomorrow and it would 
cost us only a few dollars. It would be senseless for us to 
suggest this as one in the arsenal of measures, if it were 
impractical or too costly. We are discussing this matter from 
the political viewpoint. We are trying to establish whether or 
not it is an appropriate move, whether or not it would be a 
savings. We are discussing the measures' advantages and 
disadvantages. We are discussing them to get all the information 
we need, not because it is impossible for us to do. It will also 
be up to us whether we seize part of the money and leave the 
rest. 
  "There are many solutions. What we need is awareness and 
knowledge. One of the reasons we are discussing all this is 
because there are many people who want the problem confronted 
and solved but do not agree with the measures that would solve 
the problem. As I said earlier, it is very necessary that we 
have the people's understanding of the measures to be adopted. 
There is no doubt that the measures adopted must be intelligent 
measures. We are discussing and questioning because we hope to 
find the best solution to this delicate problem. This problem is 
the result of the situation we are experiencing. You must 
realize that we are looking for solutions to the problem of 
excess currency under abnormal conditions. The other countries 
are experiencing normal conditions, yet they are devaluating 
their currency. Mexico did it. When Mexico devaluated its 
currency, it was exporting in large quantities, had a lot of 
oil, and was not experiencing a blockade. Devaluation is the 
same as seizing currency. The Mexican peso was 12.5 to a dollar, 
and from one day to another, it went to 250 pesos to a dollar. 
Devaluation and seizing currency are the same things. 
Devaluation is a systematic seizure of money and workers 
everywhere fight for raises. If there is 10-percent inflation, 
they ask for at least a 9-percent, even 8-percent, raise. As 
inflation goes up, the workers continue to ask for raises. They 
get raises, but their wages are really getting cut by 50 percent. 
  "We do not know what an inflation phenomenon is all about. 
We 
have been lucky to have the sacred ration book, the blessed 
ration book. Perhaps one day, someone will explain how it has 
been possible for the Revolution to do all that it has done. All 
that was done has not been based on foreign cooperation alone. 
Simply put, the people in this country have been the ones who 
financed the building of schools, roads, and so forth. When we 
did not have the money to build a hospital, that hospital would 
be built. Why? Because we had the ration book. Without the 
ration book, our budget would have required complete balance to 
keep the prices down. We built thousands of schools, hundreds 
and hundreds of hospitals, many things, and the liter of milk 
never went up a single cent. The price of meat and food did not 
go up. I am talking about that golden era when the products in 
the ration book were much more numerous than today. 
  "I have always been aware that the people financed the 
social 
and economic development of this country. We did not have a 
budget; we had no income to build these things. The amount of 
currency on the streets increased, but the people continued to 
get their products every month, and always at the same price. 
  "I never heard anyone in this country ask if we had a budget 
for [words indistinct] and the people's governments know this. 
Ever since the people's governments were established, all they 
have done is build and do things, invent things. Ever since 
1976, the people's governments have done everything they wanted 
to do. However, no one ever asked if the state had a budget for 
what they wanted to do. They never asked if there was money for 
what they wanted to do. Just having the plan and the need was 
enough. Back then we had enough cement, steel, and lumber. The 
wages, the money to pay those wages, came from the Ministry of 
Finance. And this had been the case for these past 30 years. 
Under normal conditions, the people financed all the work done. 
This was done without inflation. Prices were never freed. Had we 
freed our prices we would not have been able to do all this. Had 
we freed our prices we would have had a constant increase in 
prices. Only as the years went by did the prices of certain 
products go up. 
  "Today we are facing a problem similar to the one we had in 
1970. There is an excess of money. There is so much money that 
the people are not interested in money. Many people can live 
with the wages earned by one member of the family. This also 
happened in 1970. 
  "You have talked about encouragement for work done. You 
should also talk about the need to work. Man works because he 
needs to work. Excess money results in some people not working 
because they do not need the money. Others do not work -- like 
the comrade from Trinidad said -- because they would rather be 
self-employed. Another comrade mentioned the risk of all workers 
in the crafts sector deciding to become self-employed. However, 
I have asked the people responsible for the crafts centers about 
this and they have told me that not too many workers have left. 
Many workers have grown accustomed to the centers; they get the 
raw material they need, and they are being taken care of. We 
must struggle to keep those workers and make sure they stay with 
us. I believe that gathering up that excess currency will 
contribute to the people needing work. Encouragement is 
something else. There is not much material encouragement we can 
give, but whenever we can, we do give it. 
  "We are talking about finding a financial balance and 
solving 
the problem of excess currency at a time when the socialist bloc 
no longer exists and our imports have dropped by 78 percent. We 
are talking about all this at a time when the blockade is 
stronger than ever, and during the special period. We are 
talking about all this amid an international economic crisis. 
When other countries faced similar problems, they did not endure 
what we are enduring. It is much more difficult for us. However, 
we are not afraid to tackle the problem. The Revolution demands 
that we do what we must with the support and understanding of 
the people. 
  "I can recall that the cigarette issue underwent much 
discussion. It was an issue on which we could not agree, so we 
decided to ask as many people for their opinions as we could. We 
even asked the people's councils for their views on this and 
that. The opinion of others has not always been the best 
solution to our problems. I could mention many things we 
discussed, and the solutions derived from these discussions 
turned out to be worse than if we had not discussed them. The 
decision we made on cigarettes is one of them. The decision we 
made on cigarettes is one of them. [Castro repeats himself] We 
found ourselves facing the problem of [words indistinct] find a 
way to increase the price of cigarettes. We had a standing quota 
and it was not appropriate. The Executive Council had reached 
specific conclusions, but when we broached this issue with the 
commission responsible for organizing the last congress, we 
could not reach an agreement; we could not get a consensus. It 
was then that we decided to consult other people, including the 
people's councils, but no agreement was reached. The truth, the 
big truth, is that another cigarette quota was implemented. That 
crazy quota of providing cigarettes to everyone who was 18 years 
of age and above. But it is impossible to keep an inventory of 
who smokes and who does not smoke; everyone 18 years of age or 
older got cigarettes. Since many of those people do not smoke, 
they would sell their cigarettes. The black market now has more 
sources. Today we have more sources. Anyone who can get his 
hands on a pack of U.S.-made cigarettes is a source for the 
black market. People receive new or worn clothes and sell them 
here at outrageous prices. Anyone traveling today and bringing 
back 10 kg of medicine -- something we authorized to help those 
who needed medicine that the State could not provide because it 
did not have the money to buy it -- becomes a source for the 
black market. All the money that comes into the country today, 
every single dollar that finds its way to a store, becomes a 
source for the black market. Anyone receiving $100 can purchase 
products at the foreign exchange stores and sell those products 
for thousands of dollars. There are many factors that promote a 
black market. Excess currency is not the only factor, even 
though it worsens the problem. There are many factors that 
promote this situation [words indistinct] evil, a sickness that 
we have to live with [words indistinct] finding solutions under 
the most difficult conditions. I believe that what we are doing 
is the most appropriate, honest, and loyal thing we can do for 
the people. 
  "We are only interested in the people knowing what we are 
doing. Whose understanding do we need? The people's. Those who 
have illegal money do not know what to do with it. They are 
being creative with their money. If they get nervous, that is 
their problem. It is their problem if they do not have a clear 
conscience. However, the honest people of this country should 
harbor no worries at all. [applause] [Words indistinct] from the 
arsenal of things. Adopting some of these measures will 
represent a sacrifice. If you are going to charge the people for 
uniforms, that will represent a sacrifice. Perhaps the lady who 
has 100 pesos will have to buy a uniform. I do not know. Some 
here have suggested that we subsidize the people without making 
a commitment to subsidize them. This does not mean that the 
person who earns minimum wage and must buy uniforms, if uniforms 
are subsidized, must go to the social security office to get a 
ticket [preceding word in English] and pay for the uniform. If 
we were to do this, we would never get rid of our excess 
currency. 
  "Taxing of certain articles increases the price of the 
article. I believe this tax should be applied to nonessential 
products, but any cut in subsidies would increase the price of 
essential products. We must check and see how high those prices 
would be and make sure that the people can still afford to 
purchase those articles. Any of those measures, such as taxing 
certain articles, will represent a sacrifice for the people. No 
matter how minimal the tax, if we implement a general tax, such 
as the one Jose Luis said was abolished in 1967, it will 
represent a sacrifice. 
  "I see no possibility of us straightening out this mistake, 
this unavoidable mistake [words indistinct] someone's whims. It 
is precisely the Revolution's basic sense of justice, its basic 
need to protect the people, the basic need to maintain the 
rights and achievements of the Revolution, that force us to make 
sure that no one is left unattended, that not a single recently 
graduated university student is jobless, that a middle-level 
technician be jobless. And this is what has led us to this 
situation. This is nothing new, we could see it coming. It led 
us into the special period. This situation was unavoidable. 
Yesterday we were talking about recovering the sugarcane 
industry. The situations are quite similar. Did someone here 
whimsically or capriciously cause the drop in production? We 
were actually attempting to increase our production. We were 
seeking to produce 10 million [not further specified]. We were 
seeking to produce 10 million, using the same amount of land. 
The drop in sugar production is the result of the special period 
and as we said yesterday, we are seeking to increase production 
in accordance with the special period. That is why we kept 
asking so many questions about land, fertilizer, yields, et 
cetera. 
  "However, we must all know that, despite the measures we 
adopt, it will not be possible to straighten out this situation 
if we do not solve all the problems first, and everyone must 
know that we will not be able to solve them immediately. It will 
take some time to solve all these problems and it will not be 
possible to solve them without some sacrifice. We must be aware 
of this and the people must be aware of this. 
  "We are going to continue debating all this. We are going to 
continue debating. And there is something else. As I explained 
before, measures on this subject are already being taken. We 
cannot wait to have a complete package. It is even possible that 
it might not be appropriate as a package, but as a group of 
successive measures inspired by certain specific principles. 
These are the principles we are trying to define here. We do not 
have to wait for another meeting. Perhaps we need to meet again 
just for this, and to continue the discussion. The next time we 
will be more knowledgeable, will have a higher level of 
information. Perhaps we can meet for two days and discuss 
principles. I do not think you would mind meeting here again. I 
do believe some of the principles have been clarified. Jose Luis 
talked about measures to be adopted this year in the hope of 
reducing expenditures. We are working hard to create UBPC's. 
This should represent a reduction in expenditures. We must work 
to curb increases. Whatever we can save in the budget is an 
adopted measure. We must then work on the other measures. We 
must decide whether we tax certain articles; whether we should 
implement a general tax; whether we should eliminate certain 
gratuities, not because they would represent a savings, but 
rather because they would create an awareness, which must be 
strengthened in these times. Once we have overcome this 
situation, we will be much more efficient. We will no longer be 
thinking of the millions we can make, but will rather create an 
economic awareness among the people, so they value what they 
have. Let us wait and see what comes out of this meeting, what 
the rank and file have to say, what the people have to say about 
this. I hope our media will report on this broadly, thus helping 
you and all of those deputies the people will elect in the next 
election. 
  "The next time we meet, everyone will have a great deal of 
information on all these ideas so that we can continue to 
discuss principles. I repeat, this does not mean that we will 
not begin to adopt measures as of now, basic and obvious 
measures aimed at saving. No one is going to object to this. No 
one will object to attempts aimed at increasing production. 
However, I can assure you that the efforts we are making are 
truly desperate efforts aimed at increasing production. Have no 
doubt about this. No comrade has been sitting with his arms 
crossed. Everyone is working in all areas to increase 
production. Everyone is doing his best to achieve this despite 
the situation. 
  "It is obvious that we cannot discuss all our problems here. 
There are many things that must be done with discretion. Marti 
was very clear when he said: There are things that must be done 
discreetly or they will not get done because the enemy will 
sabotage them. There are things we must do, and whatever we do 
cannot be sabotaged. They [the enemy] will be even less able to 
do so if the people are aware, if the people understand them 
[the measures]. We need the people to understand them. We do not 
expect the people to applaud. Everytime we need to make a 
sacrifice, the people feel it. And if we have to make certain 
sacrifices, what we need is for the people to understand them 
because these sacrifices are unavoidable, sacrifices that we 
have to make. What we have to attain is the people's support for 
these policies. That is what we must seek. 
  "Before the other deputies speak, I suggest that we start 
thinking about an extraordinary meeting to discuss these issues. 
I suggest that the meeting be held as soon as possible. 
[applause] The enemy will then find out if we are or are not 
brave. The hoarders and peddlers will then realize that they 
cannot fool the Revolution, that the Revolution is stronger and 
has more resources than they imagine. 
  "I do not think we need to take a break. How many more 
speakers are scheduled?" 
  Alarcon answers: "Twenty-two." 
  Castro exclaims: "What do you mean, 22? Ducks do not play 22 
in the lottery [en la charada 22 no es pato]." [laughter] 
  Unidentified speaker: "Frog plays 22." 
  Castro: "Frog? No it cannot be. Goats play 28? I used to 
play 
the lottery. I believe someone suggested the establishment of a 
national lottery to solve the budget problem. I do not know if 
they want to include the illegal lottery [bolita] as well. We 
must respect the comrade's idea. I do not wish to hurt his 
feelings, I am just citing his idea as an example. When the 
provincial meetings were held, all this was discussed. 
  "Alarcon, analyze this idea thoroughly and decide if your 
deputies need a break, or if they can continue. If you think 
they want to continue, we will continue, otherwise we will take 
a short recess so that everyone can make a technical stopover. 
Then we can continue to talk about all this." 
  Ricardo Alarcon declares a 20-minute recess. When the 
meeting 
resumes, Alarcon recognizes and gives the floor to Carlos Lage 
who wishes "to make a specific proposal." Lage supports Jose 
Luis Rodriguez' statement on the amount of money owed among the 
various enterprises. He asks that a list be made with the names 
of the enterprises and the amounts owed by them and owed them 
for these to be "discussed at the extraordinary meeting." 
  At approximately 0500 GMT, Alarcon asks the deputies if they 
wish to speak or would rather wait until the extraordinary 
session is held. The deputies relinquish their right to speak 
and Alarcon begins to summarize Castro's views on the various 
topics, suggesting that all debates be postponed until the 
extraordinary session. He asks that the deputies study what has 
been said and be prepared to continue these debates "when we 
take up the subject again at the extraordinary session." 
  The second ordinary session of the ANPP concludes at 
approximately 0520 GMT with the singing of the national anthem.

  [Text] La Paz, 15 Dec (ANF) -- Defense Minister Antonio 
Cespedes and General Moises Schirique, joint chief of staff, 
have demanded "total control" over the U.S. funds that come to 
the country as military assistance and within the framework of 
bilateral agreements to fight drug trafficking. 
  The two high-ranking officials told this newspaper that "the 
U.S. military assistance is not in cash, and they administer the 
funds themselves. For instance, $1 million is promised, but 50 
percent or more is used to cover the movement and stay in 
Bolivia of their own personnel. They even import their own 
water with those funds." 
  The sources explained that if the United States delivered 
the 
funds assigned to military assistance in cash, no U.S. advisers 
would need to come to Bolivia, and "Bolivian professional 
soldiers would take over the jobs they fulfill in the midst of 
continuous controversies." 
  The defense minister said it would be very good if the Armed 
Forces were allowed to directly administer the U.S. military 
assistance. Gen. Moises Schirique told local media that "we 
would like the United States to give us the money to carry out 
the tasks they perform." 
  "It is undoubtedly something we must achieve gradually. The 
participation of our local contribution must increase and then 
take over altogether," Minister Cespedes Toro said, during the 
Engineering Military School 1993 graduation ceremony. 
  The Defense Ministry official contradicted the general in 
that Cespedes said the Armed Forces do not depend in any way on 
the U.S. Embassy, while Schirique said the U.S. technical 
cooperation "generates a certain dependence of the institution." 
  "What happens is not dependence, it is a plan for U.S. 
military assistance and support for the fight against drug 
trafficking," the minister said. 
  The U.S. assistance has been dropping in the continent for 
some time. Bolivia, due to the satisfactory level of its fight 
against drug trafficking, will apparently be affected by a 
smaller drop as compared to other countries in the region, the 
minister said. 
  "We still need to conduct bilateral negotiations on the 
matter," Defense Minister Antonio Cespedes Toro said.

  [Text] La Paz, 30 Dec (EFE) -- Supreme Court [CSJ] Chairman 
Edgar Oblitas today accused the government of unleashing a dirty 
war against him, and announced a criminal trial against the 
newspaper ULTIMA HORA of La Paz, which had published accusations 
by a drug trafficker of alleged bribery affecting the judicial 
branch. 
  Oblitas' remarks have aggravated to an even greater degree 
the confrontation between the Judicial and Executive Branches, 
which has prompted a movement for impeachment for corruption 
against the CSJ chairman and a CSJ member which has not yet been 
cleared by the Legislative Branch. 
  Oblitas also accused the U.S. Embassy in La Paz and the Drug 
Enforcement Agency (DEA) of being involved in "a truly dirty war 
to tarnish the image of the CSJ chairman." 
  The CSJ chairman made these accusations because of the 
publication on 26 December of a statement made under oath by 
drug trafficker Carmelo "Meco" Dominquez, who was arrested again 
eight months after his escape, in which he said he had bribed 
several judges. 
  Dominguez, captured on 24 December in the eastern town of 
Santa Cruz, after his escape from a police clinic in La Paz on 
17 April, said in his statement, which was published by ULTIMA 
HORA, that from Sucre, the site of the Supreme Court, he was 
asked for $120,000 "so as to be acquitted in the trial against 
me for drug trafficking charges." 
  According to Dominguez, the money "would be for Edgar 
Oblitas, Ernesto Poppe, and Edgar Rosales," all members of the 
Supreme Court, but that it was not given, according to what he 
said, because "I did not have the money, and I decided to 
escape." 
  Oblitas said that "in face of the collapse and failure" of 
the impeachment, "where absolutely nothing has yet been proven 
in the Ibarra case, the government is now resorting to 
complicity with a well-known and morally discredited drug 
trafficker, setting up a new scheme in an effort to try to 
involve (the CSJ chairman) with that criminal." 
  Jose Maria Antonio Ibarra, former Nicaraguan deputy minister 
of the presidency, had accused Oblitas and Poppe, in addition to 
former Justice Hugo Galindo, of extortion in order that the CSJ 
might rule illegal his extradition, as had been requested by the 
Managua Government. 
  Ibarra handed over to the Bolivian Government a videotape, 
obtained with the technical support of the U.S. Embassy, which 
shows the moment he was handing over to Galindo the money that 
was allegedly intended to achieve the court's favorable ruling. 
  The video was submitted to a Chamber of Deputies committee, 
which has concluded its investigations but has not yet announced 
a decision establishing whether or not impeachment against the 
CSJ chairman in the Senate is legal. 
  Oblitas has asked his lawyers to file suit against Ted 
Cordoba Claure, director of the newspaper ULTIMA HORA, for 
"manipulating in a dirty and criminal manner" the news "and for 
leading public opinion astray." 
  The newspaper limited itself only to stating that it had 
published a summarized version of Dominguez' remarks to the 
authorities after his arrest on Christmas Eve. 
  Meanwhile, the suspended justices, on trial for having 
granted a medical dispensation that facilitated Dominguez' 
escape, have warned the detainee that he must convincingly prove 
his denunciations of a $10,000 bribe, or defend himself in the 
trial they will conduct against him.

  POTOSI DEVELOPMENT--Minister of the Presidency Carlos 
Sanchez 
Berzain announced that the government has signed agreements with 
Potosi local authorities to launch development projects on the 
order of $60 million. The money, to be disbursed in 1993-94, 
will come from the National Treasury and international 
organizations. Some of the main points of the "Potosi Accord" 
are: 
  --CORDEPO (Potosi Development Corporation) will receive 2 
million bolivianos (around $400,000) to complete projects 
already under way. It will use $100,000 of its 1994 budget for 
the final plans for the Huayllani Dam. 
  --Potosi Airport will receive $600,000. Additional financing 
will also be available for improved road and rail service 
throughout the department. 
  --Two universities will receive aid and priority will be 
given to the construction of primary and secondary schools. 
  --The Emergency Mining Plan's nutrition program for needy 
and 
unemployed miners will be implemented. Daniel Bracamonte 
Hospital will receive aid. 
  --Under an agreement between the government and the Bolivian 
Labor Federation (COB), priority will be given to reinstate 
those National Railway Enterprise employees dismissed under the 
government's privatization plan. [Santa Cruz EL MUNDO 19 Nov] 
  EL ALTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT--Following a three-day visit, 
a 
Japanese technical team signed an agreement with the Auxiliary 
Air Navigation Services Administration for a $35 million credit 
from the Japanese Government. The money will be used to 
modernize El Alto International Airport in La Paz. The proposed 
project includes the construction of new passenger terminals and 
the installation of modern communication and air traffic control 
equipment which would convert El Alto into the country's best 
airport. [La Paz EL DIARIO 17 Nov]

  [Text] JATHA--Finance Minister Fernando Illanes told 
American investors that only 15 percent of Bolivia's potential 
hydrocarbon resources have been explored and developed, and 
emphasized the investment opportunities in the various sectors. 
  According to Illanes, there is an oil and gas potential of 
53 
percent in the 386,000 square miles of national territory, and 
it is considered that only 15 percent of that area has been 
explored and developed. 
  He described the petroleum as light, and noted that there 
are 
extensive fields with natural gas deposits. 
  He also indicated that proven reserves of gas have amounted 
to 6 trillion cubic feet over the past 10 years, and that 
current gas exports to Argentina amount to 200 million cubic 
feet per day. 
  Illanes indicated that projected natural gas exports to 
Brazil could exceed 1.1 trillion cubic feet at a rate of 250 
billion cubic feet per day, bringing investments to more than 
$2.8 billion. 
  Regarding investment opportunities in the electricity 
sector, 
Illanes reported that generating capacity is 550 megawatts, with 
the possibility of rising to 900 megawatts by the year 2000. 
  He explained that the National Electric Power Enterprise 
(ENDE) expects to build some 1,000 kilometers of transmission 
lines. 
  Among the incentives that will encourage foreign investment 
are the efficiency of generation and the installation of 
distribution companies. 
  In addition, he indicated that the growth rate is estimated 
at 7 percent a year, and that the new investments in the sector 
could generate more than $300 million between 1995 and 2000. 
  Concerning opportunities in the telecommunications sector, 
he 
described the following: 

  -  Telephone density of 2.7 lines per 100 inhabitants. The 
lowest percentage is 5.8 lines per 100 inhabitants. [as 
published] 
  -  Eighty percent of service is concentrated in La Paz, 
Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba, with 40 percent, 25 percent, and 15 
percent, respectively. 
  -  Only 45 percent of international calls 
are completed. 

    He explained that unsatisfied demand today amounts to 
100,000 
lines, 50 percent more than the number currently installed, and 
that density is expected to be 5.2 lines per 100 inhabitants by 
the year 2000. 
  In this regard, an investment of $630 million will be 
required over the next 10 years, and some 400,000 new lines will 
be installed by the year 2000. 
  Regarding the National Telecommunications Enterprise 
(ENTEL), 
Illanes stated that in 1992 it had approximately $42 million in 
current operating cash, and it paid $25 million in dividends. 
  Illanes explained that the national airline, Lloyd Bolivian 
Airline (LAB), primarily services international routes, but it 
also dominates the domestic market. 
  He added that LAB has an inadequate, old, and fuel-guzzling 
fleet, so the capitalization of the firm will require some $40 
million. In addition, the privatization of airports and air 
services is contemplated. 
  He stressed that the National Railway Enterprise (ENFE) has 
a 
monopoly on that service, and noted that the state-run railway 
has reduced its surplus employees from 5,000 to 2,900. ENFE has 
a net value of approximately $80 million, he said, and its 
operational costs cover its operational income. 
  After stating that Bolivia is primarily a mining country, he 
explained that mining exports from the private sector exceeded 
those of the public sector, and that in the last few years 
foreign investment has amounted to $10 million.

  [Text] Mexico City, 3 Jan (AFP) -- The Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity (URNG) said today that it "totally and 
absolutely rejects" the Guatemalan Army's report on the URNG's 
alleged links with the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN), 
which began an armed struggle in Mexico on 1 January. 
  Luis Becker, a member of the URNG's political-diplomatic 
commission, told AFP that "the report (issued by the Guatemalan 
Army) aims to misinform to create confusion and problems." 
  He insisted there are no links between the URNG and EZLN, 
and 
he stressed that "we absolutely respect the political situation 
(in Mexico), and therefore we refrain" from issuing an opinion 
on the emergence of the guerrilla movement in Chiapas State in 
southern Mexico. 
  In Guatemala, the Army said today, there "are signs" the 
URNG 
"might be involved" with the guerrilla EZLN, which is occupying 
several towns in southern Mexico. 
  Becker said he does not know whether the "disinformation" 
seeks to prevent the return of thousands of Guatemalan refugees 
who live in Chiapas and other southern Mexican states and who 
for several months have been preparing to return to their places 
of origin. 
  The Guatemalan guerrillas, who are planning to hold a round 
of peace negotiations with the Guatemalan Government on 6 
January, have said that they will issue a communique "later" on 
the "disinformation" spread by the Army about their links with 
the EZLN. The EZLN has said there are no foreigners in their 
movement and that their members come from various Mexican 
locations.

  [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 28 
November 1993 on page 5 reports that the El Caracol Enterprise, 
which was turned over to 100 workers in 1990, still employs all 
100 employees, who receive as benefits a basic market basket, 
transportation, a uniform, shoes, and medical care. The market 
basket includes 20 pounds of rice, 20 pounds of sugar, six bars 
of soap, 10 pounds of beans, and a gallon of oil. The article 
reports that workers earn between 600 and 900 cordobas per 
month. According to Ronaldo Rodriguez, president of the 
enterprise's board of directors, El Caracol sells 130,000 to 
170,000 pounds of grain per month, and has set a goal of 200,000 
pounds for December. 
  Managua BARRICADA of 6 December 1993 on page 14 reports that 
the footwear factory Rolter will be shut down temporarily due to 
financial problems caused by smuggling and taxes. Assistant 
Manager Francisco Lacayo explains that the factory cannot 
compete with smugglers who pay no import tax while the factory 
is forced to pay a 17-percent sales tax to Managua City Hall. 
Lacayo says that the tax is "excessively high" for a product 
which is included in the basic market basket. According to the 
article, the enterprise's 240 workers, most of whom are single 
mothers, understand the factory "is going through hard times" 
and hope that it will reopen in a few months.

  [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 6 
December 1993 on page 15 reports that, according to Oscar Aleman 
of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Trade Department, if Nicaragua 
signs a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Mexico, it will ba able 
to participate indirectly in NAFTA. He reasons that an agreement 
with Mexico will favor Nicaragua because Nicaragua's labor force 
is cheaper that Mexico's. Aleman believes that as Mexico 
prospers under NAFTA, it will become more open to buying 
Nacaraguan products, which will not have to reach the same level 
of quality as they do for sale to the United States. Aleman 
expects that Nicaragua will continue to export goods to the 
United States under NAFTA. Nicaragua currently exports to the 
United States $17 million worth of goods. 
  Carlos Reynaldo Lacayo, a member of the American Chamber of 
Commerce, explains that joining the FTA will not solve thge 
country's problems. He calls on the government to establish 
fiscal, monetary, and credit policies to allow businessmen to 
modernize equipment and update technology in order to be more 
competitive. Lacayo explains that political and social stability 
and a new labor code are also necessary to stimulate investment.

  [Text] Lima, 2 Jan (EFE) -- The Peruvian Army has 23 new 
generals as of Sunday, after President Alberto Fujimori approved 
their promotions. The promotions were established by special 
resolutions issued and signed by Fujimori and published today in 
the official gazette EL PERUANO. The 23 colonels to be promoted 
to brigadier general come from special areas such as infantry, 
artillery, cavalry, engineering, communications and the judge 
advocate's office. 
  The Peruvian president also promoted seven generals to 
division generals, the highest rank in the Army. These soldiers 
are Tomas Cavero, Jose Picon, Juan Leon, Enrique Torrico, 
Napoleon Vasquez, Andres Sanchez, and Guido Guevara. Rear 
Admirals Jose Texeira, Enrique Salomon, and Americo Ibarcena 
were promoted to vice admiral, the highest rank in the Peruvian 
Navy. Major Generals Cesar Urday, Ernesto Burga and Luis Moy 
were promoted to liuetenant general, the highest rank in the 
Peruvian Air Force. 
  All these promotions were confirmed by presidential 
resolutions and published in the official gazette. The 
promotions are consistent with the new Constitution, which went 
into effect on 31 December 1993. It states that the promotions 
of high-ranking officers of the Armed Forces are to be confirmed 
by the president after each branch of the Armed Forces presents 
its recommendations. The old Constitution stated that promotions 
were to be confirmed by the legislature upon a recommendation 
sent by the Executive Branch. 
  The political opposition criticized the constitutional 
change 
because they believed this undermined legislative authority and 
allowed for "politicking" with the military institutions. The 
opposition magazine CARETAS said in December that the military 
High Command and General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, the commander 
in chief of the Army and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
had decided on the promotions themselves, adding that the 
"politicizing and counter-institutionalization in the Army has 
had devastating effects." Peruvian opposition parties view 
Hermoza as a negative factor within the Army, and they have 
requested his removal on several occasions. All of the requests 
were rejected by Fujimori. 
  Hermoza is considered to be the Peruvian president's closest 
military ally after he backed Fujimori's self-inflicted coup 
d'etat on 5 April 1992, when the president dissolved the 
parliament, closed down the Judicial Branch, and assumed full 
power.

  On 28 December the Economy and Finance Ministry approved an

accordance with the agreement, which was signed on 17 December 
by the Peruvian and Swiss Governments, Switzerland will pardon 
the debt -- worth over 196 million Swiss francs -- so part of 
the money can be used for aid and development programs. (Lima

  The Peruvian Energy and Mines Ministry reported on 30 
December that in 1994 the proven hydrocarbon reserves will 
increase by 10 percent, thus reaching 420 million barrels, in 
accordance with the results of drilling done in 1993. The data 
indicate that production increased by 9 percent compared to 
average production for 1992. The report also states that mining 
increased by 4.5 percent compared to 1992, and that the 
production of all important metals increased, except silver 
production, which dropped by 2.3 percent. The report adds that 
gold production increased by 3.9 percent in August and 10.8 
percent in November. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1648 GMT 30 Dec 93)

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Valle del Cauca Department </F>
Governor Carlos Holguin Sarti by announcer Dario Arizmendi; from 
"Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] We now welcome Valle del Cauca Governor 
Carlos Holguin Sarti. We wish you a happy new year, Governor. 
We want to ask you -- indeed, this is the purpose of our call 
-- a question: Do you know whether all of the U.S. Marines have 
arrived at Bahia Malaga, and when will they begin the community 
projects that the U.S. Embassy says the Marines will carry out? 
  [Holguin] First, allow me to restate my best wishes for 1994 
to you and all the Caracol journalists and contributors, and 
particularly to your large audience. I hope this year is 
beautiful and good, and I hope the best for everyone this year. 
  Referring to the U.S. troops' presence in Bahia Malaga, 
Juanchaco and Ladrilleros, I understand only the so-called 
advance platoon has arrived -- some 13 men. I believe this is 
the correct number. They will... [pauses] they are currently 
involved in preparing the camp that will house the remaining 130 
men, who, if I am not mistaken, should arrive on 4 or 5 January. 
  [Arizmendi] Do you not receive information on the U.S. 
troops' mobilization? 
  [Holguin] [Bahia Malaga Naval Base Commander] Rear Admiral 
[Jose Ignacio] Rozo was kind enough to inform me. He kept me 
informed about their arrival, but we have had no further contact 
over the weekend. 
  [Arizmendi] Governor, do you really believe they will engage 
in community work, or are they coming with ulterior motives -- 
of a police nature, perhaps? 
  [Holguin] That is what the document signed between the 
national government and the U.S. Government states. One cannot 
mistrust... [pauses] if one cannot trust the word, much less can 
we mistrust an official document signed by the government. 
[sentence as heard] There is something else: They are 
restricted to operating exclusively in the zone of Juanchaco and 
Ladrilleros, which is an isolated and solitary area which cannot 
be reached except by sea. Access is difficult, and there have 
never been drug trafficking operations there, nor do we know 
about the existence of laboratories and crops. Furthermore, the 
climate is not appropriate for this type of activity. Well, 
this makes it easy to see that they are coming only and 
exclusively for what the document or agreement between the two 
governments states. 
  [Arizmendi] Mr. Governor, does this mean the violent 
criticism issued by certain Valle del Cauca and national groups 
concerning the U.S. troops' presence is groundless? 
  [Holguin] I believe this was given too much prominence. I 
said since the beginning that someone tried to make a mountain 
out of a molehill. I understand this perfectly well, and I said 
so. I added that I considered the troops' arrival untimely 
because it coincided with statements made by the U.S. ambassador 
following Pablo Escobar's death. He said things would continue 
against Cali; that a war should be unleashed here, etc., etc. 
This, well... [pauses] obviously, this not only alerted the 
people, but it also coincided with the troops' arrival. It was 
natural and logical for the people to react the way they did. 
  Nevertheless, I reassert what I have already said: The 
document outlines what they have come to do. We also are 
remaining alert to make sure they are restricted to the zone, as 
the document also states; do not carry weapons; and carry out 
their work. Among other things, they have a very short time to 
carry out their work, because they are scheduled to leave the 
country on 28 February. 
  [Arizmendi] Excuse me, Governor. Nevertheless, criticism 
from all of the political groups has continued because of the 
presence of these U.S. soldiers and engineers. For example, the 
M-19 [19 April Movement/Democratic Alliance] filed 
administrative and procedural charges against President Cesar 
Gaviria with the Attorney General's Office because, it claims, 
he violated the Constitution when he failed to consult Congress 
or the State Council about the troops' presence in our country. 
  [Holguin] Well, I cannot... [pauses] I have no authority to 
pass judgment on the requisites and precepts that the 
Constitution and law establish for the national government to 
abide by in this type of operation. I understand these 
operations have been carried out based on treaties signed by the 
country many years ago. Moreover, they have been carried out 
every so often, on a regular basis, in different parts of 
national territory. 
  I have personally attended the so-called Unitas Operation on 
several occasions. This is a joint operation between the U.S. 
Navy, the Ecuadoran Navy, and the Colombian Navy. I believe it 
is held every year or every two years in Colombian territorial 
waters and in the Pacific Ocean. I think they are -- how can I 
say it? -- operations foreseen in international treaties that 
have been duly signed, ratified, and approved by Congress. 
Nevertheless, that does not fall within my purview, and I do 
not have enough information or data on this. I suppose the 
national government has obviously abided by all the precepts of 
the Constitution and the law.

  [Text] (DYN-NA) -- President Carlos Menem yesterday [1 
January] denied the possibility that a coalition government 
could be formed in 1995 by factions of the ruling Justicialist 
Party and the opposition Radicals, despite the fact that they 
have reached a deal on constitutional reform because the 
differences between the two remained too great. 
  "We can agree on political issues but the lack of 
similarities in the economic field will make that kind of 
government impossible," Menem said in his native La Rioja. 
  The president's comments were prompted by an interview with 
Radical Party (UCR) Chairman Raul Alfonsin published by the 
Buenos Aires newspaper LA NACION on Friday [31 December]. 
  In the article, Alfonsin suggested that "all those who want 
to defend the overall plan that will be an alternative to the 
neoconservative model" followed by the Menem administration join 
together to form a coalition government when the next 
presidential and congressional elections are held. 
  Among potential members of his group, Alfonsin said, was 
"the 
large portion of the Justicialist Party that is opposed to the 
policies that (the government) is carrying out." 
  Alfonsin also spoke out in favour of the idea of continuing 
in favour of the idea of continuing the dialogue begun between 
the UCR and the government on constitutional reform to address 
issues such as education and foreign policy, "where we will 
also debate quite a bit." 
  "This moment in Argentina should by symbolized by the word 
dialogue," said Alfonsin. 
  However, Menem appeared unwavering in his attempt to stress 
the differences between his party and the UCR. 
  Agreement on economic matters, said the head of state was 
impossible because "the Radicals continue to support an economic 
system like that which led to the situation we experienced in 
July 1989, which was uncontrollable." 
  Menem stressed that his administration would not stray from 
the economic course it had charted. "While my government lasts a 
devaluation of the peso is impossible; thus the exchange parity 
(between the peso and the United States dollar) will remain 
unchanged." 
  The President also lauded the successes his government had 
logged last year. 
  "Nineteen ninety-three has been one of the most brilliant 
years for the Argentine Republic with the consolidation of the 
democratic process beginning with the accord" on constitutional 
reform signed last month by Menem and former president Alfonsin. 
  In addition Menem noted, "The country grew at a rate of 
nearly seven percent at the same time as the poverty indicators 
decreased and unemployment showed a tendency to decline." 
  Menem noted that between May and October 1993 unemployment 
dropped 0.6 percent from a record-high 9.9 percent. "It's a 
small decrease," said the President, "but it marks a tendency 
for this year." 
  Labour Ministry figures released on Friday that show an 
increase in unemployment between October 1992 and last October 
to 9.3 percent from seven percent. 
  While still in La Rioja Menem also asserted that last 
month's 
riot in Santiago del Estero was fomented by "agitators who have 
infiltrated the province" and may also be doing so in other 
provinces.

  [Text] Danish Development Minister Helle Degn has arrived 
in our country. She is optimistic about the possibility that 
our country might become the beneficiary of significant 
financial support. 
  Danish economic cooperation with our country was 
discontinued 
after [former Bolivian dictator Luis] Garcia Meza's coup in 
1980. The cooperation agreement was not restored for over a 
decade. Bolivia may now be a Latin American country chosen to 
receive financial support from this Nordic country. 
  [Begin Degn recording in Danish with superimposed 
translation 
into Spanish, in progress] ...actually much interest, and eager 
to visit the cooperation projects between Denmark and Bolivia. 
[end recording] 
  Asked why the cooperation had been discontinued for such a 
long time, the minister explained that Denmark had waited for 
democracy to be solidly established in our country. 
  Bolivia is, however, not the only country hoping for this 
financial assistance. [passage indistinct] 
  With the goal of convincing the Danish Government of our 
country's various needs, Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas 
will join Minister Degn in traveling to Beni Department and the 
plateau region. 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] In our governmental agenda this 
cooperation is required, especially in the fields of 
agriculture, craftsmanship, the advancement of women, 
educational reform, dairy products -- an area in which they have 
already been supporting us in a significant manner -- and other 
areas that our country may propose to Denmark. 
  I have discovered that she has an extremely positive 
attitude 
toward cooperation with our country. These three days will be 
dedicated to talking with her in depth to convince her -- and 
convince the Danish people -- of resuming and normalizing their 
cooperation with our country. 
  I hope the rains will allow us to have an uneventful and 
successful trip. [end recording] 
  The Danish minister was optimistic. She also visited 
Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and Economic 
Development Minister Fernando Romero. 
  Danish cooperation will be earmarked in particular for 
social 
programs. If positive results are achieved, it will involve $20 
million.

<F P=106> [Interview with Martha Garcia Ferrufino, head of the </F>
Secretariat of Provincial and Rural Development, at her office; 
date not given -- first five paragraphs are PRESENCIA 
introduction] 
  [Text] Last 6 August, during the ceremony of taking office, 
the first Aymara vice president of the republic, Victor Hugo 
Cardenas, said that "after 500 years of colonial silence and 168 
years of exclusion, we are speaking up to tell our truth." 
  This seems to be the tone that has been adopted in the new 
National Secretariat for Provincial and Rural Development, the 
mission of which is to "raise the standard of living for rural 
inhabitants at a significantly greater rate than that of the 
rest of the Bolivian population, and expand the relationship 
between rural inhabitants and the authorities at all levels." 
  The head of this office, Martha Garcia Ferrufino--the only 
woman at that level of the Executive Branch--has worked for the 
last 10 years with peasants in Mizque, Carrasco, Puna, and 
Tiraque provinces, through the nongovernmental organization 
[NGO] Center for Agricultural and Livestock Development 
(Cedeagro), of which she was the director. 
  The interview that follows was carried out in her office at 
the National Service for Community Development. One's attention 
is called to the fact that on the walls there are no traditional 
portraits of leaders of past administrations, but rather maps, 
papers, and blackboards full of innumerable notes. 
  Her enthusiasm in explaining her plans was only tempered 
when 
she remembered her activities in the Cochabamba valley where, 
she is certain, she will return after fulfilling her new mission. 
  [PRESENCIA] In general terms, what are the objectives of the 
National Secretariat for Provincial and Rural Development? 
  [Martha Garcia] They involve turning government strategies 
and policies around toward an environment that is normally 
forgotten: the rural areas. The provinces are slowly 
languishing, they have no economic, social, or cultural 
prospects in the face of the indifference of the city people and 
the State. 
  I believe that a small space has opened up in this 
government--that of the Secretariat of Provincial and Rural 
Development, and of Ethnic, Racial, and Generational Affairs--to 
be able to resolve, or at least to facilitate, a process of 
development that brings confidence and energy to the rural 
population, to be a tool for their future. 
  [PRESENCIA] The distinction between province and community 
is 
important. In general, the villages have always had conflicts 
with the communities, how do you view that? 
  [Martha Garcia] When the President said that we all belong 
to 
an ethnic group, he stated a truth. We all belong to an ethnic 
group--Quechua, Aymara, Guarani, Chiquitana, Mojena, etc.--but 
also, after 168 years of the Republic, we have another 
reference, of legal, geographic scope, which is the province. 
  What is in the province? The indigenous-peasant community 
and 
the residents of its capital cities and its sections and 
cantons. But now most of the indigenous groups and peasants have 
moved to these capitals, because their former employers have 
been abandoning their family estates. 
  Thus, an almost unified, uniform, and homogenous movement 
has 
now developed in the rural area, which does not deny that there 
must be a level of cooperation between the villages, which are 
disappearing, and the communities, which look to these small 
capitals for their economic reference of commercial transactions. 
  [PRESENCIA] How are you carrying out the work? 
  [Martha Garcia] By focusing on what the province is, based 
on 
diagnostics made by its own inhabitants, for them to be the 
first to make a reading of the reality of their corresponding 
provincial jurisdiction. 
  This means that the inhabitants, at each administrative 
level, are carrying out a census of their natural resources, to 
determine how many people are they, who they are, to what 
culture they belong, where they are located, and what type of 
production and prospects they have. That is the first thing they 
should do, to give them the information to also permit them to 
objectively define what their needs are and develop strategies 
to respond. 
  I insist that the Secretariat of Rural Development aim to 
promote activities permitting very flexible proposals to be 
defined for provincial, global, and also local development in 
the provinces, beginning with their own inhabitants, and to 
expand these into the microregions where there are calls for 
unified efforts to resolve the problems. 
  [PRESENCIA] How will the peasant community become involved 
in 
this process, given its diversity and the existence of internal 
and conflicting authorities within the provinces themselves? 
  [Martha Garcia] One must start with the fact that there is a 
basic organization in the rural area that must be respected and 
with which one must cooperate. I am speaking of the ayllu, which 
is a natural organization; and the peasant syndicate, which is 
structured and has a hierarchical order. 
  Then, we want to enter in a fashion that is objective and 
honest, for once, to help resolve the problems of the 
communities while respecting their structural organizations: 
ayllus, communal syndicates, subcentrals; in the case of the 
Guaranis, their assemblies. It is necessary to respond within 
these contexts, because they have their own ideas of what the 
local transformation must be and the definition of the services 
they require. 
  [PRESENCIA] What are the objectives of the Secretariat you 
are heading, for the next four years? 
  [Martha Garcia] A very dynamic action program will be 
carried 
out in the provinces to establish local organizations that will 
initially be called Provincial Development Councils. 
  The Councils shall be charged with getting political society 
to work with civil society in each of the provinces. In fact, 
there already are political authorities (sub-prefectures and 
mayoralties) and civil authorities, peasant organizations 
(ayllus or assemblies; unions, and their expression in centrals 
and sub-centrals), and civic committees. 
  This should permit the design of the provincial development 
strategy, and the authorities must monitor the process of 
transforming the education, health, and productive sectors, and 
provide working guidelines for all the entities doing 
development work in the provinces. 
  I am referring to the NGO's, Churches, FF.AA [Armed Forces], 
etc., which must all act according to the same guidelines. 
Currently, some projects are in a state of chaos; anyone may 
enter a given geographical environment and establish direct 
contact, without anyone monitoring them or ensuring 
compatibility with a global proposal. 
  In summary, the trend is that each province communicate with 
the authorities to coordinate systems, strategies and control, 
and even to monitor the different tasks as they are completed, 
in such a way as to respect the strategy the province itself has 
laid out, avoiding isolated activities by either public or 
private entities. 
  [PRESENCIA] In the Executive Branch's new structure, rural 
areas are divided among three ministries: Human Development, 
Finance, and Sustainable Development. The latter also has 
authority over the Institute for Colonization and the National 
Council for Agrarian Reform. How will your work be compatible? 
  [Martha Garcia] Coordination among the three ministries must 
be of a complementary nature, of common effort with respect to 
the strategies that will be designed. 
  Some of them are regulatory in nature, while others support 
and strengthen the activities that are carried out throughout 
the entire rural environment, and I repeat that the objective is 
to serve the provinces, even though there may be differences of 
focus on what the territory should be, or which actions 
correspond to cultural expressions, etc. The goal is to respond 
in an integrated fashion to the needs of the rural inhabitants. 
  I do not believe there will be conflicts, but rather that we 
will complement each other. 
  [PRESENCIA] But, for example, if the Ministry of Sustainable 
Development declares a tax reserve in a zone where you have 
decided to bring new land into production, doesn't that create a 
conflict between the two? 
  [Martha Garcia] What we are doing is making the proposals 
compatible and defining what the activities of the three 
Ministries will be within those zones, which may in fact create 
conflict. 
  Let us look at the other side. For example, the case of 
natural resources. The Ministry of Sustainable Development will 
regulate their use throughout the country, but it is the rural 
inhabitants who will apply those regulations. But this not only 
involves conservation, but reproduction of the natural resources 
in a sustainable fashion. 
  [PRESENCIA] Another potential conflict is between 
business-agricultural-livestock interests and peasants organized 
in unions or communities in the same area. How will you address 
that reality? 
  [Martha Garcia] This is dealt with in the legal area; that 
is, how the large farmers and ranchers will be treated, as well 
as the small farmers living in the same zone. 
  For the rest, reality shows significant conflicts in our 
country: one can see signs of wealth and misery side by side. 
  How to carry out activities in those areas? With respect to 
our areas of responsibility, this involves small farmers 
beginning to have a healthier and better consolidated economy, 
to permit them to live in a more comfortable and modern fashion. 
  The objective--as the minister of Sustainable Development 
has 
said--will first be to save the small farmer, to try to resolve 
the basic problems. Then, serve the large ranchers and farmers. 
In any case, there will be certain restrictions on 
everyone--both small and large farmers--particularly with 
respect to the preservation of natural resources, the forests. 
Neither large nor small farmers may diminish our national 
endowment. 
  [PRESENCIA] How do the different secretariats in the 
Ministry 
of Human Development coordinate with each other, particularly 
when several carry out direct activities in the rural area? 
  [Martha Garcia] The secretariats, jointly and in agreement 
with each other, will design the activities and proposals. 
Moreover, these will also be agreed upon as an axis with the 
local participants, particularly in the health, education, and 
productive sectors. 
  For example, if in the provinces where, together with the 
local population, we are carrying out work we deem necessary, 
involving the creation of five school districts, that means the 
Secretariat of Education should be involved there. What is 
important is that the definition and geographical coordination 
of activities be developed locally rather than by the 
Secretariats. 
  [PRESENCIA] In the area of education, are the proposals of 
the Educational Reform Support Team and your Secretariat 
compatible? 
  [Martha Garcia] I believe that the problems are being 
resolved. The educational reform proposal is being evaluated by 
all the Secretariats of the Ministry, which are reviewing its 
defects and weaknesses, but also its successes, based on the 
recognition that, given the state of the educational system 
today, we have an obligation to reform it. 
  [PRESENCIA] Many analysts indicate that without large 
economic investment, the rural standard of living will not 
improve. How will resources be generated and directed and how 
will the scale of production of the small farmers be increased 
if the market is still small? 
  [Martha Garcia] The first market is the rural one, 
consumption. Our basic objective is to cover the needs of the 
rural population, and our purpose is to increase production. 
  [PRESENCIA] How will the channeling of resources to the 
rural 
areas be organized? 
  [Martha Garcia] I believe that the level of local 
organization is basic, basic, that is, direct communal 
participation from diagnosis to problem resolution. 
  That means becoming involved in the peasant economy through 
productive infrastructure. That leads us to prioritizing the 
expansion of irrigated land. I am speaking of small projects 
ranging from rehabilitating irrigation ditches watering between 
10 and 60 hectares, to medium projects covering up to 200 
hectares. We will follow up implementation of agricultural and 
livestock programs with technical support, to permit substantial 
improvement in living conditions and ensure at least increased 
cash for those communities. 
  The good thing about irrigation systems is that they 
coordinate different ecological levels. Normally, seed 
production is carried out at high ecological levels, while 
irrigation systems are built in the valleys. This means that 
improved seeds will be produced simultaneously in the high zones 
and planted in the valley zones, and thus production levels will 
be improved. 
  [PRESENCIA] Will the money be given as credit or donation? 
  [Martha Garcia] Most of the resources have to come to this 
country in the form of donation. But they will serve to create a 
provincial rotating fund that will permit lending for production 
purposes. It will be a credit that will be managed locally, and 
we will seek for it to be gradually rotated into a seed bank, 
which will also be locally managed and administered, which will 
set an example for saving in the community. 
  [PRESENCIA] Will access to this type of supply be through 
the 
community, cooperatives, or families? 
  [Martha Garcia] Community. But within the community 
individuals, that is, the family, will be respected. Experience 
shows that both institutions must co-exist: the community, as a 
level of social control, administration and investment 
monitoring, and the family, which must ensure efficiency in 
managing the crops and their relationship with the community. 
  We are speaking of social capitalization, because if the 
community administers the resources, it should also monitor a 
level of guaranteed returns, returns that must lead to the 
generation of surpluses (even if minimum), which can be 
converted into social capital for the community. 
  In summary, the rotating fund is a credit that normally 
would 
be handled in cash. For example, agricultural and livestock 
warehouses that will initially be co-administered with the 
community, but which the latter must prepare, and in the future 
they can administer those resources on their own, while 
simultaneously acquiring the ability to resolve problems and 
provide services for production. 
  [PRESENCIA] Does this mean repeating the experience of the 
Peasant Agricultural Corporation (Coraca)? 
  [Martha Garcia] No. Coraca was administered from the city, 
not by the community, and it failed because there was no 
resolution on the part of the community, particularly in the 
management of its resources. 
  What is now being proposed is to establish cooperation in 
managing the provincial economy, to make it possible for 
investment to be defined by the community; that is, for the 
community to make the request, which will be satisfied through a 
very well-structured organization within the community, which 
must exercise social control and have a good level of 
administration and technology, because it must monitor the 
management and permanence of those resources. If there is no 
regular return on investment within the community, then one can 
only with great difficulty speak of a structural resolution to 
communal problems. 
  [PRESENCIA] The Secretariat of Provincial and Rural 
Development is also responsible for relations with peasant 
organizations. Is it carrying out that activity? 
  [Martha Garcia] I can say that relations with the peasants 
and Indians will be much more efficient. Until now, there have 
been only political relations, which have ignored the peasant 
and Indian bases. 
  Our proposal is to develop relations with the structured 
bases in the sector with respect to the subcentrals and 
centrals. The activities will be more direct in the areas where 
they are located: there will be a more concrete relationship 
that will resolve all claims that previously were normally 
handled by hierarchical petitions through the peasant structures. 
<H5>  Areas of Extreme Poverty </H5>
  [PRESENCIA] The plan submitted by your Secretariat proposes 
to serve 60 provinces.... 
  [Martha Garcia] In principle that would be the number, but 
now we intend to cover 80, because the President requested that 
we serve all rural provinces, except for the department capitals 
and the 12 that are under the attention of the Secretariat of 
Agriculture and Livestock--which reports to the Ministry of 
Finance--which intends to convert them to intermediate cities. 
Thus, we will serve 80 of the 108 provinces throughout the 
country, and approximately 300 sections. 
  [PRESENCIA] What time frames have been defined? 
  [Martha Garcia] Based on different studies, we have 
determined that approximately 35 provinces already have 
development proposals. Of the 35, 14 already have organized 
activities and their proposals for provincial development are 
already advanced. First, we will attend to those 14, and in 
1994, to 24. 
  These provinces are in every department except Pando, which 
has none at that level of organization. 
  [PRESENCIA] Where are the most depressed areas of the 
country? 
  [Martha Garcia] Several studies of the poverty levels in the 
provinces show that most provinces are at a level of poverty or 
extreme poverty. 
  [PRESENCIA] There is the impression that the standards of 
living are higher in the east. 
  [Martha Garcia] Yes, but there are exceptions. For example, 
on a scale of 1 to 100, the Ichilo region rates 77; Sandoval, 
60; but Abuna is at 1 and is one of the poorest in the country. 
Elsewhere, Tapacari has 3; Chayanta 8, and so on. 
<H5>  Inefficiency of Contacts Only at Government Headquarters </H5>
  Among its mandates, the Secretariat for Provincial and Rural 
Development has that of "expanding the relationship between 
rural inhabitants and the authorities at all levels." That 
means, among other activities, communicating with the peasant 
union leaders and agreeing with them on different proposals to 
carry out. 
  Martha Garcia recognizes that "up to now we have discussed 
only the formation of the Secretariat with the leaders of the 
General Trade Union Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia 
(CSUTCB), which initially accepted it, but we have not laid out 
definitions. Once the proposal is finished, it will be necessary 
to discuss it with them, as well as the Secretariat's strategy." 
  She says, however, that the dialogue was developed with the 
organization that until this week was headed by Paulino 
Guarachi. But, she comments, "not only in the CSUTCB, but also 
in the Nationalist Confederation, different political parties 
are represented, the UCS [Solidarity Civic Union], MNR 
[Nationalist Revolutionary Movement], etc., and dealing with so 
many interlocutors here, at government headquarters, is not the 
most efficient and effective way. So, it is rather at the level 
of the union centrals, which are the intermediate entities, and 
the departmental federations, with whom we are trying to arrive 
at an agreement and jointly define what the strategies will be, 
because activities now are joint efforts, and are not just on 
the part of the Secretariat." 
<H5>  The Potato, Symbol of the Crisis in the Countryside </H5>
  One product exemplifying the crisis Bolivian peasants are 
experiencing is the potato. This product, originally from these 
zones and constituting the main dietary product, is now in a 
process of genetic degeneration. 
  Martha Garcia explains that low potato production goes back 
to 1983-84, when there was a severe drought with "rather serious 
results, forcing the peasants to harvest so intensely that 
subsequently "there was overproduction of potato, because for 
other products, the harvest was truly disastrous. But now one 
cannot even overproduce potatoes. That is, the genetic material 
in the seeds has deteriorated to such an extent that it has 
disappeared from almost 60 percent of the community." 
  This means, says Martha Garcia, that "there is no guarantee 
in the producing communities of their basic foods, which are 
potato and corn." 
  Thus, she adds, "our greatest concern is to gradually 
recover 
this product and try to ensure that the communities can 
basically produce for their own sustenance. The average current 
potato yield nationally is 4.5 tons per hectare, compared to a 
potential average of 20 tons, and the production from a 
1/4-hectare parcel can easily be calculated. Thus, one of our 
objectives is to increase potato production from 4.5 to 5.6 tons 
per hectare." 
<H5>  Exports and Small Farms </H5>
  The current hegemonic trend is to insert ourselves into the 
international market in a competitive fashion, which among other 
things, means increasing export levels. 
  This has two direct effects in rural areas: one, the 
increasing importance of agro-industrial enterprises that 
produce for export, and two, those who work for these companies 
are converted into agricultural workers. 
  But most of the peasant population simultaneously maintains 
its traditions and forms of production, limited by the expansion 
of small holdings. 
  Given that reality, Martha Garcia says that the Secretariat 
for Rural and Provincial Development "will try to consolidate 
and resolve the problems of the small landowner. Issues of 
salaried agricultural workers will pass over to the Ministry of 
Labor, because they involve labor relationships." 
  And with respect to small farmers, Garcia explains that this 
is a structural problem, which "may be resolved only with great 
difficulty. Surely this problem will be included in the 
Agriculture Law, in which tenancy and land ownership issues will 
be defined. What we will do will be to work with those small 
farmers to ensure them a level of productivity and food 
subsistence."

  [Text] The largest criminal organization in the country 
conducted a demonstration of force early this morning. In a 
bold operation, 30 drug traffickers of the Red Brigade invaded 
the Engenho Novo Police Precinct in Rio de Janeiro and rescued 
38 inmates from the cells. 
  [Begin unidentified reporter recording] The gang closed 24 
de 
Mayo Street, one of the busiest in the outskirts of Rio de 
Janeiro. The group comprised 30 men, armed with rifles and 
machine guns, who wore civilian police vests. The seven 
detectives who were in the precinct were taken prisoner and 
handcuffed. The gang opened cells and released the 38 inmates. 
The gang took all the weapons from the police precinct and even 
used a police vehicle to escape. A man who was riding a 
motorcycle in the area was beaten. Within 30 minutes, more than 
100 policemen had begun the search for the gang. The 
shantytowns of surrounding areas were cordoned off, but only two 
inmates were recaptured. Another inmate was found dead in a 
street close to the precinct. He was a police informer who was 
murdered by the gang. 
  The police knew that the order to take over the police 
precinct came from drug trafficker Atlas Ferreira, aka Adam, one 
of the principal Red Brigade chiefs and a drug trafficking 
leader in the Vigario General shantytown. The police believe 
the main objective was to rescue one of the gang leaders, Luiz 
Carlos Goncalvez who has been sentenced for homicide, assault, 
and kidnapping, and who was to be transferred to a high security 
prison today. The police were impressed with the boldness of 
the gang. As they left, they fired shots in all directions 
leaving marks on the walls and scaring the neighborhood. One 
shot entered the window of the house next to the precinct. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Rickey Singh] </F>
  [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 31 Dec, CANA -- Three early 
general elections resulting in a surprising change in government 
in one country and a political crisis in another, and closer 
ties with Cuba and Central America were among the arresting 
sketches on the political landscape of the Caribbean Community 
(Caricom) in 1993. There was also a unique meeting between U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and five of Caricom's 13 heads of 
goverment that irritated some Community leaders who subsequently 
failed to meet separately with Vice President Al Gore. 
  In Jamaica, which accounts for more than a third of the 
13-member Community's ethnically and culturally diverse 
population, Prime Minister P.J. Patterson led his incumbent 
People's National Party (PNP) back to power with a massive 
electoral victory. The March 30 election that coincided with 
Patterson's first anniversary as successor to the retired 
Michael Manley as leader of the PNP and government, gave the PNP 
52 of the 60 parliamentary seats. But the win was dampened by an 
electoral turnout of approximately 58 percent, one of the lowest 
in Jamaica's electoral history, and sustained charges of 
electoral malpractices, including stuffing of ballot boxes on 
voting day. The election results forced the opposition Jamaica 
Labour Party's leader, ex-prime minister Edward Seaga, to 
publicly indicate that the "rebuilding process" of the party 
could include determining his own future with the JLP. 
  Three months later, on June 30, the veteran politician of 
Belize, George Price, took a gamble with a snap poll that saw 
his People's United Party (Pup) losing power. The PUP lost by 
three seats to Manuel Esquivel's United Democratic Party (UDP). 
The UDP's 16-13 victory, which surprised some political 
analysts, was its second in three contested elections. 
  Four months after the poll, Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds 
of St. Kitts and Nevis also chose to call an early election on 
November 29, only to be faced with a crisis that by year-end was 
posing a threat to the longevity of his one-seat majority 
coalition government. Simmonds' People's Action Movement (PAM) 
gained four of the eight seats in St. Kitts -- the same number 
as the opposition St. Kitts-Nevis Labour Party -- with the three 
seats in sister territory, Nevis, being shared by the Concerned 
Citizens Movement (CCM) of Premier Vance Amory (two) and the 
Nevis Reformation Party, PAM's traditional coalition partner 
(one). The swearing in of a minority coalition government of PAM 
and NRP with Simmonds back as prime minister, sparked violent 
demonstrations, forcing declaration of a state of emergency, a 
dusk-to-dawn curfew and an appeal by Simmonds for assistance 
from the Regional Security System (RSS). Both the curfew and 
state of emergency were lifted within two weeks, but the 
bitterness between labour and the coalition remained. 
  The St. Kitts Christian Council and the Evangelical 
Association failed in bids to broker a peace that would have 
resulted in fresh elections within six months, which labour 
party leader Denzil Douglas said was "the logical and decent 
thing to do." Douglas, pointing out that his party commanded 54 
percent of the votes cast to PAM's 42 percent, warned that a 
"new election is now inevitable since we have no intentions of 
being governed by two parties in a coalition overwhelmingly 
rejected by the electorate." In a no-confidence motion in the 
new parliament, the CCM's two votes would be crucial to bringing 
down the PAM-NRP coalition. 
  The year 1993 also saw changes in the leadership of the 
governing Dominica Freedom Party (Brian Alleyne for the retiring 
prime minister Eugenia Charles) and the ruling Antigua Labour 
Party (Lester Bird for his octogenarian father, Prime Minister 
Vere Bird, Sr). 
  There were also numerous technical and ministerial meetings 
to advance the deepening and widening of the region's 
20-year-old economic integration movement, Caricom. At the 14th 
Caricom summit in The Bahamas in July, heads of government 
decided to have in place "appropriate measures" so that the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), subsequently 
approved, would not adversely affect the Community's trade and 
agricultural policies. The region's dissatisfaction over 
benefits from the current Lome IV convention with the European 
Community and its concerns over access to the North American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) without "undue disadvantages" from 
concessions already granted to founding members like Mexico, 
were also on the agenda of that summit. After the meeting, on 
August 30, the president of Guyana and the prime ministers of 
Jamaica, Barbados, The Bahamas, and Trinidad and Tobago were 
invited to a unique working luncheon meeting at the White House 
with President Clinton. 
  While U.S./Cuba relations remained a cause for concern, for 
the five Caricom leaders, the Community's access to NAFTA on 
favourable terms was the major agenda item. They left Washington 
with a promise from the President that his administration would 
study the likely negative impact of NAFTA on the region's 
economies to determine how best it could respond to Caricom's 
areas of concern. The leaders of the Organisation of Eastern 
Caribbean States (OECS) were not happy over the choice by the 
Clinton Administration for the August 30 working lunch and, with 
the exception of Prime Minister Charles of Dominica, failed to 
show up for a planned October meeting with Gore. 
  Prime Minister James Mitchell of St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines reflected his own disagreement when he said that 
while the President of the USA was free to invite whoever he 
wished, "I do not recognise two sets of Caricom heads of 
government." During October, Caricom heads of governments were 
meeting again for a special session in Trinidad and Tobago, this 
time with the leaders of the so-called "Group of Three" in Latin 
America -- the presidents of Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia -- 
as well as the vice president of Suriname. Delegates said the 
meeting was "a positive development in the process of increasing 
political consensus which is developing in Latin America and the 
Caribbean...." They pledged to find mutually acceptable 
solutions to common problems. 
  Their interest in encouraging deeper involvement of the 
private sector in new development thrusts in the post-Cold War 
phase of rising mega-economic blocs, was later reaffirmed when 
the sixth Europe-Caribbean conference, organised by the 
Caribbean Council for Europe took place in Santo Domingo, the 
Dominican Republic November 10-12. One of the significant 
developments flowing from that conference was the inauguration 
on November 28 in Santo Domingo of a federation of European 
chambers of commerce. 
  Except for the Port-of-Spain meeting of Caricom and Central 
American leaders, Cuba was involved in all of the major meetings 
and events organised by the Community's governments during the 
year. Having rejected "misrepresentations" and "unnecessary 
fears" emanating from a group of United States congressmen over 
a proposed Caricom-Cuba joint commission, the Community's 
governments went ahead and formally launched the commission on 
December 13 in Guyana, where the inaugural meeting reviewed the 
wide range of areas for technical, economic, and cultural 
cooperation. Earlier, Caricom countries had, for the first time, 
given overwhelming support to an approved resolution at the 
United Nations General Assembly in October for an end to the 
31-year-old U.S. trade, economic, and financial embargo against 
Cuba. The Cuban foreign minister, Roberto Robaina Gonzalez, who 
subsequently made a seven-nation tour of Caricom member states, 
estimated that the U.S. embargo had already cost his country 40 
billion U.S. dollars. Robaina said he would visit the remaining 
six other Caricom countries early in 1994 to "strengthen our 
relations with the Caribbean which we regard as a natural ally." 
  The Caribbean Conference of Churches and the Caribbean 
Policy 
Development Centre (CPDC) of non-government organisations were 
active in their advocacy for the lifting of the U.S. embargo 
against Cuba. They were also very vocal, along with Caribbean 
Rights, in urging Caricom governments to keep alive demands for 
the international community to help restore constitutional 
government in Haiti under exiled president Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. Toward year-end, however, such a development seemed 
even more remote than prior to the United Nations brokered peace 
pact in July at Governor's Island in the USA that called for 
Army strongman, Raoul Cedras, to step down from power and for 
Aristide to return by October 30 as head of government. 
  It was also a year that saw government and tourism officials 
worrying about crime. (Tourism for the estimated 30 member 
countries of the Caribbean Tourism Organisation in all four 
major language areas of the region, accounted accounted for 9.8 
billion U.S. dollars in revenue for 1993, or approximtely 100 
million U.S. dollars more than in 1992.) Crimes of violence, 
rape and murder, particularly in evidence in countries like 
Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Barbados, and St. Lucia, 
included among its victims in 1993 the prison superintendent of 
Trinidad and Tobago, Michael Hercules. Gunned down while on a 
charity mission, Hercules, hailed as one of the region's strong 
advocates of penal reform, was given a state funeral and praised 
by all sections of the society. The year saw a widening between 
the country's police service and the government, in particular 
its minister of national security, Russell Huggins, whose 
disagreements with both the Police Service Commission and the 
police commissioner, Jules Bernard, were no secret. 
  The minister's own initiatives on structural changes and 
"cleansing" of the police service were related to the findings 
of a Scotland Yard investigative team that had found "endemic 
corruption" in the country's police service. But he failed to 
get the early retirement of Commissioner Bernard. 
  In Jamaica where the incidence of violent crimes and charges 
of police corruption were also making the news, Prime Minister 
Patterson, was supported by opposition leader Seaga in the 
unprecedented appointment as police chief of the retired Army 
colonel, Trevor Macmillan. 
  The year also saw an historic ruling by Britain's judicial 
committee of the privy council in November, commuting to life 
imprisonment the death sentences of Jamaican prisoners Earl 
Pratt and Ivan Morgan. The ruling led to intense, and at time 
angry debates between opponents and proponents of the death 
penalty. One prompt and dramatic development resulting from the 
privy council's ruling against the execution of those on death 
row beyond five years, was the decision by some Caricom 
governments to commute to life imprisonment the sentence of more 
than fifty prisoners awaiting execution for murder.

  [Excerpt] In a message to the nation on the occasion of 1 
January, former Haitian Prime Minister Marc Bazin reaffirmed his 
support for holding a national conference. The leader of the 
Movement for the Establishment of Democracy in Haiti [MIDH] 
believes that the country is threatened by civil war and foreign 
military intervention. Bazin explained that violence can in no 
way contribute to a lasting solution to the crisis. For the 
first time since he resigned, the MIDH leader cited the work 
done by his government of consensus and public safety. He 
recalled that at the same period of time in 1992, his government 
already had several achievements to its credit. Marc Bazin 
admitted, however, that he did not manage to bring the two 
opposed parties to the negotiation table. The MIDH leader said a 
negotiated, peaceful, fair, realistic, Haitian solution must be 
found to the crisis. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In a message published on 2 January, the National 
Congress of Democratic Movements [CONACOM] pointed out that 
Haiti needs a truce. CONACOM says it has requested from the 
Haitian Armed Forces [FADH] the application of concrete measures 
to guarantee the safety of all the country's sons regardless of 
political credo. CONACOM's message further states that it is 
more than time to put an end to the maneuvers of politicians who 
use FADH members to arbitrarily attack their political 
adversaries. The party says it has asked President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide to see to it that the gathering initiatives that he is 
organizing abroad during this month of January contribute to 
pave the way for a true national conference. This national 
conference is to be held in Haiti and supported by the 
international community as soon as possible, with the 
participation of the political and social sectors that agree to 
work for the establishment of at least an internal democratic 
state of law, and for the short-term application of the 
Governors Island Agreement.

<F P=106> [Speech by Cuban President Fidel Castro at a national </F>
ceremony to commemorate the 35th Anniversary of the victory of 
the Revolution and the 10th Anniversary of the awarding of the 
title of Hero of the Republic and the Order of Antonio Maceo to 
the city of Santiago de Cuba in Santiago de Cuba -- live] 
  [Text] Fellow countrymen: The month of December that has 
just ended has been one with the most intense work in the 
revolution's history: We celebrated Finlay's anniversary -- 
science and medicine day; we formed the association of Cuban 
revolution fighters; held the UNEAC [National Cuban Writers and 
Artists Union] Congress, the science and technology forum, the 
party central committee meeting, the National Assembly of the 
People's Government [ANPP] meeting, plus countless public and 
private meetings -- all held during December, a truly tiring and 
admirable month. Nevertheless, something very important 
remained: No weariness could prevent a few of us from traveling 
to the city of Santiago de Cuba to commemorate this anniversary. 
Today we celebrate a most memorable day of our history. 
  First of all, the meeting of the triumphant troops with the 
people -- those the Yankees would not allow in 1898. In a very 
unfair move they prohibited the Mambisas troops from entering 
the city of Santiago de Cuba. That 1 January was not only 
memorable for that event, which took place in the city of 
Santiago de Cuba, a day that served to define whether or not a 
revolution was to take place. That day defined whether our 
country would be absolutely and truly independent. 
  Crucial events took place on that day: In the pre-dawn hours 
a coup d'etat was staged to scuttle the revolution's triumph. 
On that day again, the current Santiago de Cuba Province played 
a decisive role. That same morning, from the city of Palma 
Soriano, the order was issued to all rebel troops to continue 
advancing. Instructions were given to the Camilo [Cienfuegos] 
and the Che [Guevara] columns to advance rapidly on the capital. 
  Instructions were sent to the city of Santiago de Cuba for 
the people to be prepared to support the forces that were coming 
to liberate this city. A call was made for a revolutionary 
general strike, which paralyzed the whole country. Such was the 
revolution's overwhelming popular force that the troops 
stationed at the garrison in Santiago de Cuba placed themselves 
under the unconditional orders of the rebel forces that very 
night.... [pauses] or that very afternoon. That day we achieved 
what we were unable to achieve on 26 July 1953. In the evening, 
the whole city joined the thousands of rebel soldiers and the 
soldiers who had defended the tyrant up until the previous day. 
They came together to form an impressive force capable of 
crushing any form of resistance that could arise anywhere else 
in the country. There was, however, no such resistance anywhere 
in the country. The forces of the enemy joined the rebels 
everywhere and the people rose in arms. Meanwhile, the invading 
forces completed their missions, reaching La Cabana and Columbia 
fortresses. 
  For the first time in our history, the people held the 
weapons in their hands, as so seldom has happened before in this 
hemisphere. We were able to speak of revolution for the first 
time. That night, from this same balcony, we spoke of true 
revolution. [applause] 
  Many of the principles we have followed during these 35 
years 
were proclaimed that night. It was said then that for the first 
time there would be a revolution of the people, by the people, 
for the people. 
  Injustices would be ended. There would be true equality, 
brotherhood, and freedom for the people for the first time in 
the history of our country. 
  I remember some of things we said back then, and I will try 
to recall them. We said that men of the revolution could also 
make mistakes, but these men would never betray their 
principles. We said the men of the revolution would be honest; 
that the men of the revolution would never abandon the ideas our 
generation and the generation that preceded us had fought for so 
much. 
  That date and that night, because of their importance, will 
constitute a page in our history that will never be erased. 
  The wars of 1868 and 1895 began precisely here in Santiago 
de 
Cuba, a town that had fought so much, had sacrificed so much, 
and had shed so much blood for the dignity and independence of 
the fatherland. It was here in Santiago de Cuba and in the 
eastern provinces where the heroic history of Santiago was 
written. It was here in these eastern provinces where there 
were so many deeds by brilliant combatants and heroes. It was 
here in this city where Maceo, Moncada, Crombet, and so many 
other patriots were born. It was here in this city where Jose 
Marti came to shed his precious blood. It was here in this city 
where the Moncada fighters began their struggle. It was here in 
this city where the decisive events I mentioned on that 1 
January occurred. It was here in this city where throughout our 
generation's struggle for liberation so many pages of courage 
and patriotism were written, including the 30 November uprising 
and the battles waged by the people of Santiago de Cuba during 
the 25 months of war waged in the eastern mountains and in the 
fields of other provinces. 
  We had no doubt whatsoever what would happen on that 1 
January. We had no doubts that we would take this city. A few 
days earlier, we were forced to cease operations because after a 
clash with opposing forces, they recognized their defeat and 
proposed an end to the war and the beginning of the 
revolutionary stage. They did not keep those agreements, and 
that delayed the attack on the city a few days. On 1 January we 
were forced to advance full speed on the city. The city was 
well organized. There were hundreds of weapons inside the city 
itself. We had no doubts whatsoever that the people of Santiago 
de Cuba were to cast the final blow to tyranny. Fortunately 
those battles were never fought because the sweeping force of 
the revolution took over. The coup failed and optimum 
conditions were created for the revolutionary victory. Thus the 
city won not only enormous prestige but received the deserved 
honor of being declared a hero city and decorated with the 
Antonio Maceo Order. That happened 10 years ago, and we 
commemorate it today. [applause] Just as we did five years ago 
from this same podium, we proclaim the brave watchwords: 
Socialism or Death! [applause] 
  Three historic anniversaries! In round figures, today we are 
commemorating the 35th anniversary of the 1 January victory, the 
10th anniversary of the awarding of the hero city decoration, 
and the 5th anniversary of the proclamation of the slogan 
Socialism or Death. I ask the people of Santiago de Cuba: 
Could we have gotten by without appropriately -- albeit 
austerely -- celebrating these three anniversaries today? 
[crowd responds: "No"] Would the people of Santiago, the 
elderly and the young alike, have gone without this very 
deserved honor? [crowd responds: "No"] Could there be a 
better time than this to express our deepest conviction and our 
most unbending revolutionary spirit? [crowd responds: "No"] 
  What a beautiful poem was recited here today! For a moment 
I thought someone had written it for this occasion. I asked our 
comrade here for the author's name, and she said Navarro Luna 
wrote it in 1970. [applause] What intuition, what foresight to 
have written these concepts in such beautiful words, so adequate 
and so appropriate for moments such as this, 23 years later. 
  People of Santiago de Cuba, we have fought hard and we have 
fought for a long time. Our forefathers fought for over 100 
years in a long, bloody battle. There were difficult setbacks 
such as the events of the war of 1868, which never ended in 
glory. After ten years of excruciating battles that almost 
drained the patriots of their strength, there came something 
that honors us and makes us proud: the Baragua protest, an 
expression of our will to continue the struggle. 
  It was a hard, a very hard blow to the country because, 
when we had practically defeated the Spanish forces, the 
imperialists' intervention deprived us of our victory and again 
made us a colony. It was hard, very hard to accept the results 
and frustrations of the struggle of our workers, students, and 
Cuban revolutionaries in the 1930's as they ended up returning 
to neo- colonialism and the worst forms of political chicanery. 
However, one day we did achieve victory. This is the day we 
are commemorating here in Cespedes Park in Santiago de Cuba. 
Our reason for doing so is amply justified and righteous 
because this is a park that honors the patriot who started to 
fight on 10 October 1888. See how history blends and adjusts 
itself. You can even see this in history's symbols. 
  Yes, the struggle has been a long one. However, the struggle 
is not over yet. We mention 35 years, but what have those 35 
years meant? They have been 35 years of struggle and 
enthusiastic work by the people. They have been 35 years of 
building classrooms and graduating teachers and professors, 
ultimately helping us become the country with the largest number 
of teachers and professors per capita in the world. They have 
been 35 years of building medical centers, hospitals, general 
hospitals, and specialized hospitals, as well as regular 
schools; schools for the handicapped; and art, music, dancing, 
painting schools. I was saying that these have been 35 years of 
preparing medical doctors. In fact, we were left with only 
3,000 doctors 35 years ago, and now have more than 50,000. We 
are probably also one of the countries and, perhaps, the sole 
country with the largest number of medical doctors per capita in 
the world. 
  It has been 35 years working to encourage education and 
culture -- education which was able to multiply several times 
the number of universities in the country, as well as multiply 
the number of technical schools several hundred times. We have 
been able to turn out thousands of university professionals. We 
have been able to reach educational levels unsurpassed by very 
few countries in the world. In addition, we have been able to 
establish health standards unsurpassed by very few countries 
worldwide. It is enough to say that during 1993, even while we 
going through the harshest moment of the special period, we were 
able to lower the infant mortality rate to below 10 [for every 
1,000 live births]. What will the world say about this? What 
will the world say about a country which, despite being 
ruthlessly blockaded, and at the same time undergoing very 
special conditions, has been able to lower infant mortality 
below 10? An infant mortality rate which just a few days ago 
was 9.4. The infant mortality rate in the city of Santiago de 
Cuba was at a level of 8 for every 1,000 live births. This was 
just a few days ago! What will the world say when not one 
single woman died during delivery in the municipality of 
Santiago de Cuba? [applause]. 
  It has been 35 years of building dams, canals, highways, 
roads, all sorts of agricultural installations, diary farms, 
chicken farms, and livestock fattening farms. It has been 35 
years of establishing farms, agricultural cooperatives, and 
credit and service cooperatives. It has been 35 years of 
mechanizing the country to allow sugar cane, which at one time 
was cut by thousands of starving workers, to now be cut with 
machines. It has been 35 years of mechanizing agriculture to 
carry out field work in a more humane manner. It has been 35 
years of mechanizing construction activity, expanding ports, and 
building wharfs and terminals to handle sugar in bulk. We have 
also built piers with modern derricks that allow us to use 
modern loading and unloading systems at our ports. 
  It has been 35 years of mechanizing crops such as rice, 
which in the past was done by hand. It has been 35 years of 
building all kinds of factories and industries, 35 years of 
installing electrical plants and electrifying the country until 
we were able to provide electricity for 95 percent of the 
population. It has been 35 years of developing our people's 
culture and artistic talent, 35 years of building sports 
installations and developing our country's sports talent, making 
it accessible to the workers' children. It has been 35 years of 
building multi-family housing projects and houses, 35 years of 
building aqueducts and sewers according to our means, and 35 
years of developing transportation. It has been 35 years of 
developing the material part of our country's economy. 
  We were not working for the privileged or the rich. Those 
who graduated from our universities were generally the children 
of peasants and workers -- those who became teachers, 
professors, engineers or doctors; those who went to live in the 
houses built by the revolution; those who assumed 
responsibilities and posts were these children. 
  The revolution did not only work for material things, 
however. The revolution also worked hard for spiritual things. 
First of all, it eliminated loathsome racial discrimination. 
It tirelessly fought to eliminate discrimination against women. 
It tirelessly fought to create equal opportunities and rights 
for everyone. It fought to guarantee a retirement or pension 
for every elderly person. Even those who had not been workers 
always received the state's support. The exploitation of man by 
man has truly ended in our country. [applause]. 
  Political chicanery, in all of its expressions, also ended. 
The revolution fought to dignify man and the fatherland. The 
revolution fought for justice -- not only in domestic policy but 
also in foreign policy. Noble and generous, Cuba dispatched the 
aid of its teachers and doctors to so many corners of the world. 
Noble and generous, Cuba found it in itself to offer its blood 
in support of the just causes of other nations around the world. 
I believe and am absolutely convinced that there has never been 
a more noble and generous revolutionary political process than 
our revolutionary political process. We played our part as 
patriots, we played our part as internationalists, and we joined 
our forces with the most progressive forces of the world. We 
have defended our sovereign rights and our independence with 
extraordinary dignity. We have been willing to give our blood 
and our lives -- without the slightest doubt -- to defend our 
ideas, to defend our cause, and to defend our fatherland. 
[applause] 
  Who has accomplished more in less time? Who has accomplished 
more and with such consistency and determination than we have? 
What revolutionary political process has stayed more loyal to 
its principles that ours? However, we have been witnesses to 
tragic events: the truly embarrassing manner in which the 
socialist bloc crumbled and the truly embarrassing way in which 
the USSR disintegrated along with those processes that were the 
result of colossal sacrifices by the people. They were the 
result of colossal efforts and colossal acts of heroism. It 
would seem that history was envious of the glories of our people 
and wanted to submit us to even more severe trials. What are we 
doing now but defending 35 years of revolution? 
  What can we do today other than defend the fruits of more 
than 100 years of struggle? What can we do today other than 
defend not only the rights of the past and current generations, 
but also the rights of the future generations? When we say that 
we defend the country, the revolution, and the principles of 
socialism, we are not only talking about ourselves, but also 
about the future generations who will recount our struggles and 
our proficiency in surmounting the enormous obstacles we face 
today. What can we do other than try to be consistent with our 
history? 
  In 1993, we have undoubtably gone through the most difficult 
year of the revolution, but we have done so with dignity and 
courage. [applause] Navarro Luna [author of poem read earlier 
in the ceremony] has already mentioned the weak [flojos] and 
told them to get out of the way. As we have said on other 
occasions, it is easy to be a revolutionary during good times. 
It is not easy, however, to be a revolutionary during difficult 
times. [applause] Those of us who are meeting here are 
revolutionaries of difficult times. The champions of 1868 and 
1895 -- Moncada and Granma. [applause] They were champions who 
were able to make our fatherland what it is today. They were 
champions who had confidence in their country and their people. 
They were champions who had confidence in man and in man's 
courage and heroism. Once again, when I say man, I am referring 
to mankind, which of course includes -- and, rightfully so -- 
women. [applause] 
  Throughout its history, our country has confronted many 
difficult times. Nevertheless, our country never had such a 
large contingent of men and women with such an elevated 
revolutionary culture or such a large contingent of men and 
women with such a profound and solid revolutionary culture. 
[applause] For this reason, the weak will never be able to 
discourage us. For this reason, the weak will never be able to 
demoralize us. We will pull through, just as we have done 
during other difficult times. We are capable of pulling through 
this, which is the most difficult moment of our history. 
[applause] Instead of becoming discouraged, we must feel proud 
of being witnesses and participants of these pages in the 
history of our fatherland. 
  What are we up against? We are up against the most powerful 
empire on earth! When the socialist camp and the Soviet Union 
fell, the imperialist bloc, in a display of repugnant 
opportunism, decided to become more tyrannical and ruthless 
toward us. They simply want to make us surrender at any cost. 
They cannot stand the thought of a country in the world with 
our people's honor, dignity, and courage. [applause] They 
cannot tolerate that a country such as ours can resist in the 
face of the mandates of the hegemonic power to which so many bow 
today. They cannot tolerate that we are the standard bearers of 
the most just, noble, and human ideals. Yes, we must say 
categorically: There has not been a more noble or humanitarian 
revolution than the Cuban Revolution. [applause] It is a 
revolution whose behavior -- from the moment we respected the 
first Moncada prisoners up until today, 35 years later -- has 
not had a single blemish. Our behavior has been irreproachable 
in every respect. There is no other political process as clean 
as ours. 
  It is truly incredible that those who were the allies; those 
who in this hemisphere made thousands of people disappear; those 
who, in Central America, were the allies and supporters of those 
who killed thousands of people, most of whom turned up missing; 
those who were the allies of the South Africans; those who 
destroyed the revolution in Nicaragua with their dirty war; 
those who invaded small countries to impose their interests and 
their laws; and those who loot the world -- these are the same 
people who are trying to blemish the clean and honorable history 
of the purest of revolutions, and we can shout it out loud: It 
is the Cuban Revolution! [applause] 
  We know we are defending those values and all the other 
values we mentioned tonight, because we know that we are doing 
the most noble and just thing in the world. For this reason, we 
have strength and energy to resist and to fight. 
  We have just ended our toughest year, and if we do 
everything we should -- our duty -- with the utmost efficiency, 
we shall start reversing the situation bit by bit. Only a 
demagogue or a charlatan could tell his people that these 
difficulties are slight and the enormous obstacles that lie 
ahead will be easily won. We say yes, they will be won, but 
with much sacrifice, work, and struggle. Right now we are 
already involved in a new stage: Sugar production will not be 
much greater than last year's, but it must be greater 
nonetheless. That would be proof that we have reversed the 
situation. We are already in full harvest time; we cannot lose 
a week, a day, an hour, or a minute. We cannot allow the 
harvest to be delayed. Any delays in the harvest would bring 
forth a new set of problems and difficulties. 
  We cannot allow delays in sugarcane planting and harvesting 
and other crops in general. We should not fail in a single 
activity that we need to face up to. It has been very difficult 
to produce sugarcane and harvest it in a country where 
everything has been mechanized and yet suffers from a great fuel 
shortage, with a nearly total shortage of fertilizers, 
pesticides, spares, tires, and so on, and so on. We are 
nevertheless doing it. We are managing to do it with the 
people's creativity and imagination and with a great effort to 
conserve. 
  It is our duty not only to reverse the situation but to 
develop despite the very difficult conditions of today's world 
-- conditions I will not speak about at this event; despite the 
tragic destiny that is in store for Third World countries; and 
despite the increasing plundering and exploitation that is 
foreseen. We must be sufficiently strong, determined, and 
capable not only to overcome the specific obstacles that befell 
us when the socialist bloc collapsed and the blockade became 
more severe but to overcome the objective obstacles of today's 
world. 
  Comrades, I trust we will be able to do this. Comrades of 
Santiago and revolutionaries throughout Cuba -- you, too, will 
be able to do this. [applause] This is the moment, Comrades, 
when we must transform ourselves into a nation of giants. 
Everyone of us must become a giant, and all of us together must 
turn out more giants such as Jose Marti. We must turn out 
giants such as Antonio and Jose Maceo, giants such as Carlos 
Manuel de Cespedes, giants such as Maximo Gomez, giants such as 
Ignacio Agramonte, giants such as Mella, giants such as Frank 
Paiz, giants such as Camilo and Che. [applause] 
  We must be capable of repeating what we did on 1 January 
1959 
and once again confront all of the challenges we face ahead. 
Without any doubt, the greatest obstacle has been that there 
has been a world dominated by an empire. If not the entire 
world, then there has been a continent completely dominated by 
an empire. That same empire has attempted to counter the 
revolution but has been unable to destroy it. It has been 
unable to make our people grovel. It has been unable and will 
never be able to conquer us. [applause] 
  If there is one thing we can say today, it is that the 
greatest accomplishment the Cuban people have been able to 
achieve above all other nations in the history of the world is 
that we have been able challenge the empire. We have been able 
to resist that empire for 35 years. The empire already knows we 
are defending values that are very sacred, and we are defending 
hopes we will never renounce -- hopes for which we 
revolutionaries are willing to go our graves. Maceo already 
expressed it quite well once: Very well, if they do not die 
while attempting to take over Cuba. [applause] 
  Viva the Hero City of Santiago de Cuba! Viva the purest of 
all revolutions! Socialism or death! Free fatherland or death! 
[applause]

  [Text] Last night [30 December] at the Ministry of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces headquarters, Raul and Commander of 
the Revolution Juan Almeida presented epaulets to a group of 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] officers promoted to the rank 
of colonel, men who have fulfilled their mission exemplarily in 
defense, teaching, and research. 
  After the ceremony, I approached Army General Raul Castro 
and 
asked him to speak to the Cuban people. Please listen to his 
words. I invite our listeners to keep them in mind. 
  [Begin recording] To our entire people, especially to my FAR 
and Interior Ministry [Minint] comrades: I congratulate you on 
the 35th anniversary of the triumph of the Revolution. This 
congratulations is for struggle against all problems. The coming 
year will also be difficult. Everything is dependent upon our 
effort. 
  To the FAR and Minint troops: We have faced difficult times 
before, even before the triumph of the Revolution; even earlier 
generations, beginning with the Mambises. We maintain that same 
spirit of never surrendering, of courageously facing all 
adversity -- objective and subjective problems. There are as 
many of one as of the other. 
  This year, during the 35th anniversary, when television and 
radio play the national anthem -- which, as a matter of fact, 
they forgot to play a year or two ago -- please dedicate at 
least one moment to thinking about, internalizing thoughts: What 
has each one of us done? Not what have others done. What are our 
faults? What individual shortcomings have we? Begin with 
yourself and follow up with an analysis of the whole the Cuban 
people. 
  I wish you happiness, which means: Continue the struggle.

  [Text] The people of Pinar del Rio Province have sent 
Commander in Chief Fidel Castro a message reaffirming their 
commitment to further the development of the Revolution and the 
preservation of the accomplishments of socialism. The letter was 
read by Fidel Ramos, first secretary of the Communist Party of 
Cuba [PCC] in Pinar del Rio, during the plenum of the provincial 
PCC Central Committee. 
  This occasion, in addition to being a forum for analysis of 
the province's 1993 performance, was the right moment to read 
the message sent to the province by Army General Raul Castro. 
Raul congratulated the people of Pinar del Rio for their work 
and dedication during the 35th anniversary year of the triumph 
of the Revolution.

<F P=106> [Interview with Osvaldo Martinez, director of the Cuban </F>
World Economy Research Center and chairman of the Permanent 
Commission of Economic Affairs of the Legislative Assembly, by 
Barbara Betancourt; date, place not given; from the "Evening 
Information Review" newscast--recorded] 
  [Text] [Betancourt] At the end of the ordinary winter 
session of the Cuban parliament, during which important economic 
topics were discussed, I had the opportunity to talk to Mr. 
Osvaldo Martinez, director of the World Economy Research Center 
and chairman of the Permanent Commission of Economic Affairs of 
the Legislative Assembly. Visibly satisfied, Martinez evaluated 
the parliamentary meeting. 
  [Martinez] I believe I can tell you with conviction that the 
expectations of the session were met. I believe we produced 
what we wanted and what is fundamental: a collective reflection 
of all deputies regarding important and difficult issues. 
  Given the level of the deputies' participation, obviously 
the 
speeches by the commander in chief, the amount of information 
and ideas expressed during the meeting--and even the agreement 
to hold a special period of sessions to continue the 
discussion--I believe that the Cuban parliament has demonstrated 
a formidable lesson of democracy. This stems from the fact that 
generally these kinds of measures are taken suddenly, 
clandestinely in some countries, and are not discussed in 
parliament or later returned to parliament for further 
discussion, as it will take place. 
  [Betancourt] I asked prominent economist Osvaldo Martinez 
what he thinks of the statements by many deputies who are not 
economists. 
  [Martinez] I think that this reveals our progression 
regarding what we could call our people's economic culture. It 
is a difficult and complicated matter that obviously has many 
technical components. I believe, however, that our deputies, as 
part of our people, have such a keen political sense and a sense 
of defense of the revolution and its most vital interest that 
this helps them extraordinarily; in addition, I believe the 
deputies have seriously prepared for this period of sessions and 
studied the state of the country's internal finances. I also 
believe that I was pleasantly surprised by the level of 
understanding and manipulation of the issues broached during the 
debates. 
  [Betancourt] When certain deputies mentioned the 
implementation of such measures as price increases, policies of 
gradual taxation, the elimination or reduction of subsidies to 
companies that do not yield profits as ways to resolve this 
internal financial imbalance, may someone think these measures 
respond, for instance, to IMF recipes? 
  [Martinez] These measures in no way respond to IMF 
principles. I believe that during the discussion a principle 
that was stressed throughout was that no one will be left 
unsupported. No honest Cuban must be afraid of any measure that 
may be implemented. I think these would be logical measures 
that would be implemented due to the pressing need to achieve a 
balance in internal finances as an important step to improve our 
economy. Such measures would be aimed at the supreme objective 
of saving the revolution and overcoming the special period; that 
is why I believe that these measures can in no way be 
considered--neither from their discussion methods or contents 
--IMF-type measures. 
  [Betancourt] I pretty much know the answer to my next 
question. What perspectives.... [pauses] What do you expect for 
the 36th year of the revolution, which is about to start? 
  [Martinez] I expect a year of work, a year that will also be 
difficult in economic terms. It will require a great working 
and capacity of sacrifice from our people. I strongly believe, 
however, that the worst part is now over. I believe we can 
reasonably argue that the future will be better. We are 
beginning 1994 not only with a greater ?apacity to resist but 
also with more consolidated accomplishments and better economic 
perspectives than those we had at the outset of 1993.

  [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, who is currently 
visiting Santiago de Cuba, today inaugurated the Sierra Mar 
Hotel. The four-star hotel, located in the western sector of the 
province near Chibirico, has 200 rooms. Fidel toured the hotel, 
accompanied by authorities and an enthusiastic group of Canadian 
and German tourists. After getting over their surprise at seeing 
Castro, all the tourists tried to get near him, and to get 
souvenirs. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified woman in French] Mr. Castro 
[words indistinct], if you please. 
  [Castro] There you go. 
  [Unidentified woman in French] Thank you, thank you, Mr. 
Castro. [end recording] 
  The Cuban president admired the hotel, which has been built 
in the form of terraces on the slope of a mountain. The hotel is 
part of the tourist development center of the Sierra Maestra 
Park. 
  Last night, following the event for the 35th anniversary of 
the triumph of the Revolution, and the ceremony during which 
Fidel Castro was presented with the shield of the city, Fidel 
met with reporters. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] Commander, today you were 
awarded the highest distinction in the city. How do you feel? 
  [Castro] I am very embarrassed. 
  [Reporter] Embarrassed? 
  [Castro] Yes. I am embarrassed when I receive those honors 
and distinctions. Of course, I am honored, but also embarrassed. 
I do not consider myself deserving of so many honors. 
  [Reporter] But it is inevitable that you should receive 
them. 
It is a way to thank you. 
  [Castro] When someone gives you something, you must be 
courteous and accept it. [laughter] 
  [Reporter] Commander, do you know.... 
  [Castro, interrupts] [Words indistinct] I can only accept 
it. 
  [Reporter] Commander, we Cubans like to make comparisons. 
The 
people are asking themselves whether the most difficult year of 
the special period is now behind us. What do you think? 
  [Castro] I believe this has been the most difficult year. We 
must do our best to ensure that it was the most difficult. We 
can do that in 1994 by working more and well. If we do that, we 
can make the situation change. 
  Proof of this is the sugarcane harvest. The fact that we 
have 
a smaller harvest this year means that we are not changing the 
situation. This is why we must ensure that this harvest is in 
accordance with the plans. We must mill all the sugarcane we 
have planned to mill. We must mill it efficiently. This will 
show us whether we can change the situation. We will then know 
if we can produce 200,000, 300,000, or 400,000 tons of sugar. It 
is a good test. We have worked hard and put forth special 
efforts. 
  New things have been done and we should begin to see some 
results. For example, the work being done by the Basic 
Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's], and the support of the 
Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [Minfar] in the 
agricultural sector -- they have thousands of soldiers working 
and producing. 
  We must continue to increase our oil production. We must 
begin to see our first results in the field of exploration, not 
extraction, of oil. We must continue to promote tourism. The 
measures we are taking to decriminalize the excess currency 
should begin to yield good results. We may begin to see some 
signs of progress if we do things right. The important thing is 
to change the situation, even though it is a difficult 
situation. We are experiencing a special period, the blockade 
has deepened, and there is an international economic crisis. 
These are not favorable conditions. This is why we have said 
that we must overcome not only our problems, but the objective 
problems experienced by the world, and continue to develop. 
  [Reporter] I saw you five years ago when you launched the 
socialism or death slogan. Today when I saw you hold up a 
replica of Antonio Maceo's machete, I could tell that you were 
more filled with emotion than you were five years ago. Why? 
  [Castro] It is only logical. It is a replica of Antonio 
Maceo's machete and it was a great honor to receive it. I regret 
not having a horse like the one Maceo had. I regret not having 
an enemy in front of me. All I needed was the enemy and Maceo's 
horse. The truth is that Maceo's machete strengthens the arm and 
energizes the mind. [end recording]

system on 29 December broadcast extensive excerpts of the 
People's Government National Assembly two-day sessions, which 
closed on 28 December. As a result, the public learned about 
alarming official figures on the local economic situation. 
These are some of those figures: 
  Annual salaries paid: 8.8 billion pesos. 
  Surplus currency in circulation: 12.3 billion pesos, or the 
equivalent of 14 months of salary. 
  State corporations' outstanding debts with other state 
corporations: 2 billion pesos. 
  State budget deficit: 4.2 billion pesos. 
  Subsidies to cover losses: 4.6 billion pesos. 
  Subsidies to the agricultural sugar industry: nearly 7.238 
billion pesos from 1990 to 1993. 
  Percentage of subsidized state corporations: 69. 
  Percentage of profitable state corporations: 31. 
  The most recent state budget made known to the public was 
that of 1990, which forecast a 12.463 billion pesos revenue, a 
14.448 billion pesos disbursement, and a 1.985 billion pesos 
deficit. 
  In the official books, the Cuba peso is equivalent to the 
U.S. dollar. In the black market, the exchange rate is between 
70 and 80 pesos to the U.S. dollar.

  [Excerpt] Havana, 1 Jan (EFE) -- Cuba today commemorates 
the 35th anniversary of a revolution that placed Fidel Castro in 
power; unleashed passions throughout the world, especially among 
the Cubans, and is now going through its most dramatic moment in 
its struggle to survive. 
  Usually, 1 January is not a day of mass demonstrations or a 
day for official commemorations or speeches, because the Cubans 
also take part in the worldwide 1 January hangover, although it 
is true that the average family budget does not allow the 
majority to get involved in any overindulging on New Year's Eve. 
  In its latest edition, the official daily GRANMA says, "We 
have to look at 1994 with optimism, hope, and trust, because we 
are already 35 and the revolution will prevail." It reports 
that 1993 "will be remembered by millions of honorable and 
patriotic Cubans who have known how to firmly resist the 
onslaught of this difficult period." [passage omitted]

  [Text] For the past few days, Army General Raul Castro and 
Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [Minfar] officers 
have been visiting the Western Army units. Castro and the 
Minfar officers also have visited army self-sufficiency farms 
and state farms run by the Youth Labor Army [EJT]. Gen. Castro, 
accompanied by Politburo members Division General Leopoldo 
Cintras Frias, chief of the Western Army; Candido Palmero, first 
secretary of the City of Havana Provincial Committee; and other 
generals and officers visited Military Unit 4046 of the Cuban 
Revolutionary Navy, acclaimed for its high military preparedness 
and discipline. During his inspection of the area in the 
company of Corvette Captain Vicente Suarez, the second secretary 
of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of Cuba was very interested in learning of the military 
preparedness of the troops and the possibilities to produce food 
in the area. He was pleased to learn that the area is 
appropriate for fish breeding and that works are underway to 
expand the fishing activities in the area. They are hoping to 
catch 5 tons of fish a year. 
  Colonel Arsenio Nardo Cruz, chief of the Infantry Division 
Unit 1700, explained to Gen. Castro and the Minfar officers the 
achievements attained by the unit that contributed to its 
satisfactory results during the ministerial inspection. The 
unit was graded as good and outstanding in sharpshooting. Raul 
visited several other units and expressed interest in the living 
conditions of the soldiers, their health care, the quality and 
quantity of food the soldiers are getting, and other matters 
that affect the discipline and political and moral state of the 
soldier. Raul was very pleased to see a plaque that was drafted 
and built by Military Unit 2100. The chief of the unit, 
Lieutenant Colonel Ismael Avila, said that this artillery 
regiment is very well prepared. During the ministerial 
inspection, the unit was graded as good. Military Unit 2100 
also was graded as outstanding in sharpshooting. 
  Meanwhile, Col. Roberto Garcia Leyva reported on Military 
Unit 4790. This unit was graded as good during the Minfar 
inspection. While visiting this military unit, which is also an 
anti-aircraft defense post, Raul visited the medical clinic, the 
sergeants and soldiers club, and other installations. 
  EJT chief Brigadier General Ramon Valle Lasso in Havana 
Province met with Raul and the other comrades at Farm No. 2, in 
Quibican Municipality, one of the state-owned farms where 
various crops are grown. This farm is run by the EJT. The 
visitors talked about the plans for the farm next year and the 
EJT goals for 1994 in Havana Province. The EJT is currently 
running 19 farms in the area. These farms are the property of 
seven enterprises [words indistinct] some 5,500 workers, 
including more than 1,000 farmers. This EJT group works 846 
caballerias and they are capable of producing 4 million quintals 
of tubers, orchard products, and grains. Money is indispensable 
to run this farm. 
  The Havana Province EJT has 381 teams of oxen. According to 
information provided by Gen. Rigoberto Garcia, if the 30 teams 
of oxen on Farm No. 2 are used adequately, the farm can save up 
to 10 tons of fuel a year. The chief of the EJT explained how 
the year's program, which is adapted each work according to the 
farm and type of crop grown at the farm, contributes to the high 
productivity of the EJT in the mountain and plains regions where 
they grow coffee, sugar cane and varied crops. 
  On the last day of 1993, the second secretary continued his 
visit to the Western Army. He was joined by Commander of the 
Revolution Juan Almeida, Jorge Lezcano, and Federation of Cuban 
Women President Vilma Espin. During his visit to Unit 2721, 
Col. Lucio Morales reported on progress made in the areas of 
combat for which the unit was graded as good during the 
inspection. Col. Morales said that the unit also is involved in 
agricultural production and fish breeding activities and their 
goal is to increase production in 1994 as well as to catch 18 
tons of fish. Raul reviewed the combat techniques and inspected 
installations. 
  The chemical defense regiment was the last unit Raul 
visited. 
Raul said that he left this regiment for the last because it is 
the best in the country. The unit has been vanguard unit for 
the past four years. Unit chief Rolando Cardenas was promoted 
to the rank of colonel as a reward for his meritorious efforts 
and proven capacity. 
  During the Revolutionary Armed Forces military council held 
to review the gigantic job done in this difficult year that is 
ending, Raul said: 
  [Begin Castro recording] On behalf of the commander in 
chief, 
I wish you the most heartfelt congratulations on the occasion of 
the 35th anniversary of our glorious Revolution. All I ask you 
is that in 1994 we all work with the same spirit of the past 
three years. [end recording]

  [Text] On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the 
triumph of the Revolution, 33 Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] 
officers were promoted to colonel and ship captain. The 
ceremony was presided over by FAR Minister Army General Raul 
Castro. 
  Army Gen. Raul Castro and Commander of the Revolution Juan 
Almeida, president of the Cuban Revolution Veterans Association 
[ACRC], presented the promotions. Officer Rene Corredera Brito, 
an internationalist pilot who has received the Antonio Maceo 
Medal of Valor, spoke on behalf of the officers who were 
promoted. He thanked everyone for the trust placed in them and 
for the promotion they received, which is a sign of recognition 
for their work. Brito reiterated the officers support for the 
cause of the defense of the fatherland and their loyalty to the 
commander in chief, whose example a FAR officer should follow, 
always ready to confront the enemy and always filled with the 
belief that our noble ideals of national independence and 
socialism will triumph. 
  Division General Nestor Lopez Cuba, chief of the FAR 
political directorate, closed the event with a dynamic speech. 
Div. Gen. Lopez Cuba described 1993 as the most difficult year 
since the triumph of the Revolution, and he described the 
special period as a hard test that the patriots and 
revolutionaries are confronting with courage, loyalty, and the 
belief that it is possible to resist and win. Lopez Cuba told 
the officers that: We have absolute trust in you because we 
know you will be worthy bearers of the title of colonel of the 
Armed Forces founded by our invincible commander in chief, Fidel 
Castro, 37 years ago. He will continue to lead us, as always, 
through the most difficult and glorious moments.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with Pedro Lovaina, Cuba's charge </F>
d'affaires in Nicaragua, by Alfonso Malespin Jiron in Managua; 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Malespin] Cuba is ready to celebrate 35 years of 
the victory of its revolution. Under what conditions is the 
Cuban Revolution celebrating this anniversary? 
  [Lovaina] Cuba is celebrating the 35th anniversary of the 
revolution amid the most adverse circumstances in its entire 
history -- a time when the socialist bloc no longer exists and 
the United States is stepping up its inhumane blockade. This 
entails enormous sacrifices by our people, who are resisting in 
an effort to protect our national dignity, sovereignty, and the 
progress achieved in the areas of health, education, and labor. 
  To give just a few examples, this year the death rate for 
children fell to 9.6 for every 1,000 children born alive. We 
have more than 51,000 doctors, and more than 80 percent of the 
population is covered by the family doctor plan. Not a single 
school child has been denied registration. Despite our current 
difficulties, Cuba has achieved very high health indexes 
compared with the ones the revolution encountered in 1959. 
  [Malespin] The Cuban Government implemented important 
changes 
in 1993. What goals does the country plan to achieve with them? 
  [Lovaina] All of the measures uphold our socialist 
principles 
without giving up a planned economy. Although there will be 
increased participation of foreign capital, state ownership will 
prevail. Cuba is looking for structures that will allow a 
better integration into the world economy, particularly with our 
Latin American brothers. 
  [Malespin] Some people think Cuba is implementing a 
Chinese-style communism. Would you place your country in that 
category? 
  [Lovaina] We have taken other experiences into 
consideration, but, above all else, it is essentially a matter 
of implementing an efficient, mature socialism that solves 
national problems and allows us to efficiently achieve 
development without abandoning the concept of social justice, 
essentially taking into consideration maritime ideas, too [as 
published]. 
  [Malespin] Different experts have warned that these measures 
involve too many risks. What is the evaluation as we start 1994? 
  [Lovaina] No human project is free of risk -- nor is it free 
of mistakes -- but it is important to face these risks and 
protect the homeland, the revolution, and socialism, as Fidel 
has stated many times. 
  [Malespin] [Ernesto] Che [Guevara] warned against making the 
mistake of giving imperialism even a foothold. Has not Cuba 
done this with these measures? 
  [Lovaina] He said this within a certain context, and what he 
meant was that no concessions should be made to the principles 
of imperialism. The measures adopted today by Cuba are 
revolutionary measures to defeat the blockade, to save the 
revolution's essential achievements, and to protect our 
sovereignty and national independence. These policies are 
outlined by the Communist Party of Cuba and by Fidel Castro, and 
they are fully supported by our people. 
  [Malespin] The international community has supported Cuba by 
condemning the U.S. blockade, but it also has asked President 
Fidel Castro's Government to make in-depth changes. Will there 
be any in 1994? 
  [Lovaina] The blockade is aimed at isolating Cuba 
politically 
and economically, at undermining the Cuban people's 
determination to resist, and at creating the image that Cuba is 
hell. It does this in an effort to discourage solidarity with 
Cuba and to impose an even more abhorrent political system than 
the one that existed before 1959. 
  While a wall has been built to prevent illegal immigrants 
from other countries from entering the United States, in Cuba's 
case millions of dollars are spent to encourage illegal 
immigrants and people without documents to risk their lives to 
reach U.S. territory. 
  There are no limitations whatsoever on any Cuban citizens of 
legal age to travel to the United States -- or to any other 
country -- just as there are no limitations on any Cubans living 
in the United States, or other U.S. residents, from travelling 
to Cuba. 
  The United States, however, denies visas to 60 percent of 
the 
Cuban citizens who request them at the U.S. interests office in 
Cuba. Also, the U.S. authorities have strict penal sanctions 
for North American citizens who visit Cuba. 
  [Malespin] Referring to official relations with Nicaragua, 
what is their current status. 
  [Lovaina] Official relations between Cuba and Nicaragua are 
good, respectful, and friendly. Until this year, Cuba has 
maintained free medical assistance in Nicaragua, and a Cuban 
medical brigade will end its mission in Nicaragua this year. 
  A new medical assistance agreement has been signed. It will 
be paid for with financial aid from international organizations. 
Also, some 900 Nicaraguan students will receive free 
scholarships in Cuba.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyos from San Cristobal de las </F>
Casas, Chiapas State, for the "Panorama Newscast" -- live] 
  [Excerpts] The situtation here in San Cristobal de las 
Casas, Chiapas State, remains tense even though soldiers have 
been deployed here in the main square. This is the situation: 
There are problems getting food. Stores are closed in some 
areas. Hotels are serving food only to their guests, and it is 
just one kind of meal, nothing else. Local drugstores are 
finding it difficult to obtain medical supplies as members of 
the Zapata National Liberation Army [EZLN] looted the stores 
when they arrived. Thus there are no medical supplies for a 
medical emergency. It is also worth noting that the Mexican 
Army has resumed reconnaissance and surveillance flights all 
over the city. Starting at approximately 0700 when the weather 
allowed because the fog lifted a little, Mexican Army 
helicopters have been flying over San Cristobal de las Casas and 
the area 7 km away, where the 31st Military Zone is stationed. 
  I must also state that local residents are afraid the EZLN 
members will resume their activities near the city. Up until 
0200 we could hear heavy caliber weapons, chiefly howitzers and 
cannons, firing at rebel objectives. Early this morning I had 
the opportunity to inspect the city. It was almost deserted. 
Fear prevails as the ringing of heavy caliber weapons has been 
heard since early in the morning from both far and near. Many 
tourists have been stranded here because gas stations are not 
observing regular business hours as they fear gasoline may be 
rationed. Why is that? Because so far, Pemex [Mexican 
Petroleum] trucks have not come to supply the city's three gas 
stations. [passage omitted] Stores and schools are closed in 
this city. The only thing we see is that a few people are 
coming down from the mountain range to try to sell their 
products here. In Ocosingo and mainly on the San Cristobal de 
las Casas - Ocosingo Highway, a distance of approximately 117 
kilometers, military roadblocks are still up to keep people from 
entering due to the fierce clashes taking place in the mountain 
range, as we were told. Stores, public offices, and houses were 
looted in Ocosingo as well. A report states that 15 policemen 
were killed in a clash with the EZLN members. Four members of 
the Solorzano family were kidnapped. They are local ranchers. 
  We can also report that in (Chiompla) Municipality a young 
woman was brutally beaten and raped for refusing to give food to 
the EZLN members. The state government reported that the Army 
is in Las Margaritas and Altamirano, although there is no word 
yet as to whether the soldiers have been able to enter these 
municipalities. The fighting continues. It was also reported 
from (Chiompla) that a stronger military operation w??l be 
conducted, although the time has not been announced. That is 
what is happening now in San Cristobal de las Casas and on the 
highway to Ocosingo.

  [Text] We have received a news dispatch that reads as 
follows: 
  After strongly condemning the violent events in Chiapas 
State, the Holy See has expressed its willingness to mediate so 
the activists will lay down their weapons and present their 
demands through legal means. The Holy See advised that the 
Catholic Church cannot and should not be involved in acts of 
bloodshed, which the Gospel rejects, nor can it support 
violence. Therefore, if some lay person or clergyman is 
involved in these events, it is on a personal basis, as the 
church -- as an institution - distances itself from all of this. 
  This was stated by (Girolamo Priggiani), the Pope's 
representative in Mexico, after saying that the developments in 
Chiapas State are painful, regrettable, and dramatic. He said 
the Church shrinks from acts of violence and is not nor can it 
be involved in this delicate matter in which lives have been 
lost.

  [Text] Bishop Felipe Arizmendi, bishop of Tapachula, 
Chiapas State, has emphasized in an exclusive interview that the 
Church has nothing to do with the armed rebellion. Quite the 
contrary, he said, the Church offers to act as mediator to reach 
a consensus and prevent useless bloodshed. 
  The prelate explained that the recent events are a desperate 
measure in the face of the poverty and deprivation in which the 
Indians are immersed, above all in the Lacandon zone. 
  Bishop Felipe Arizmendi warned that any violence in Chiapas 
will result in worse repression of the Indians. He said the 
important thing is to know who is behind the Zapatista army and 
to learn if they are acting in favor of private interests that 
do not include the Indian population. 
  The Catholic Church in Chiapas has reiterated its appeal 
that 
political wisdom and historical responsibility motivate the 
parties to the conflict to seek an honest and responsible 
dialogue.

<F P=106> [Report by Maricarmen Camacho from Tuxtla Gutierrez] </F>
  [Text] The bishops of the three dioceses of Chiapas 
State--namely, Felipe Arismendi Esquivel of Tapachula, Samuel 
Ruiz Garcia of San Cristobal de las Casas, and Felipe Aguirre 
Franco of Tuxtla Gutierrez--have reaffirmed their willingness to 
mediate between the armed groups and representatives of the 
Mexican Government to establish a dialogue and find a solution 
to the conflict in the Chiapas State highlands. 
  During a news conference San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz 
Garcia said that they are awaiting a positive reply from 
subversive groups to the start of negotiations and an end to the 
armed confrontations. 
  [Begin Ruiz recording] We proposed contributing our 
recognized moral influence; all three of us agree with that 
service proposal. The mediation process will depend on the 
parties' behavior. We hope to be able to reach the party that 
declared war to find out whether it accepts our mediation. 
  What follows? We do not know, because that depends on the 
circumstances. All we can do is voice our willingness to serve 
as mediators. We will not hold talks with them, only serve as 
mediators of a dialogue. [end recording] 
  The three bishops said they deeply regret the developments 
at 
the start of 1994. Deputy Government Secretary Ricardo Garcia 
Villalobos has reported that the Mexican Government is willing 
to hold talks with representatives of the subversive groups to 
settle this problem.

<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero at Los Pinos presidential </F>
residence in Mexico City -- live] 
  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today issued an 
appeal to find points of consensus and a solution to all demands 
through dialogue and respect for the law in reference to the 
conflict in central and eastern Chiapas State, where Indian 
groups took up arms early on New Year's Day. 
  The president recognized that there are shortages and 
inequalities in Chiapas and that benefits and opportunities are 
not a reality for many, but he insisted that in recent years 
there have been earnest efforts to reverse the inequality that 
has prevailed for centuries in this zone of our country. 
  The following is part of the president's message regarding 
the violent conflicts in Chiapas. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] Let us never forget that we will 
be able to find points of consensus and solutions to all demands 
only through a dialogue within a legal framework. Let there be 
no doubt; no region in Mexico has differences that surpass our 
ability to settle them in a dialogue, nor is there a gap capable 
of dividing our essential unity. 
  Violent actions obstruct true solutions to social needs and 
cast a shadow on the settlement of disputes. Politics and frank 
communication allow us to get to the bottom of differences, just 
as joint efforts meet social demands. Solutions are found and 
provided. Mexico has no place or time for disputes that are not 
settled within a legal framework. 
  I reassert: We will always strive to defend the law and 
peaceful dialogue -- particularly for the defense of human 
rights and all the community's actions -- in Mexico. [end 
recording] 
  President Carlos Salinas spoke to congressional legislators 
who visited him on Monday. The legislators met with Salinas 
for two reasons: to notify him about the conclusion of their 
period of sessions and to confirm their support for the nation's 
institutions given the violence that has arisen in the southern 
part of the country. 
  The president, accompanied by Government Secretary 
Patrocinio 
Gonzalez Garrido -- who, by the way, has remained silent in 
recent days -- emphasized that an essential unity among Mexicans 
prevails over pluralism and ideological differences. He said 
everyone is obligated to sponsor this unity as an expression of 
his love for the fatherland. The ceremony was held at the 
Venustiano Carranza Room in Los Pinos. Maria de los Angeles 
Moreno Uriega, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' commission, 
outlined the National Congress' position concerning the events 
in Chiapas. 
  [Begin Moreno recording] The deputies who make up all the 
legislative factions and fellow senators who participated in the 
55th legislative period have asked me to express their concern 
about the events in Chiapas and to state their strong rejection 
of the attitude assumed by armed groups that have resorted to 
violence in an attempt to justify it as a method to solve 
problems that involve and affect various groups of Mexicans. 
  Likewise, the legislators express their conviction that we 
will continue to find peaceful solutions -- within the framework 
of the law and national constitution -- that will allow us to 
continue toward the achievement of specific social welfare 
goals, which is our shared goal and in which so much has been 
achieved in this phase for the sake of the republic. [end 
recording] 
  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will receive various 
groups throughout the day. This morning he was visited by his 
closest aides. Representatives of various groups have also 
arrived and will continue to arrive for the New Year 
celebrations.

Armed Forces has implemented strict security measures along the 
border with Mexico. 
  Guatemalan Armed Forces Spokesperson Edith Vargas indicated 
that a military contingent was mobilized to the common border to 
prevent the flow of weapons. Likewise, she deplored the events 
initiated by an armed group in the Mexican state of Chiapas. 
  Meanwhile, Chiapas official spokespersons revealed that the 
Mexican Armed Forces practically have the situation in La 
Margaritas and Ocosingo under control. However, the situation 
is still confusing in Altamirano. In addition, official sources 
have refused to confirm or deny reports that Governor Absalon 
Castellanos has been kidnapped.

<F P=106> [Report by Gerardo Tena] </F>
  [Text] Altamirano, Mexico, 3 Jan (AFP) -- The Zapata 
National Liberation Army (EZLN) guerrillas will not hold talks 
with the Mexican Government and will continue its war "until 
obtaining victory," several rebel leaders said today when 
interviewed in towns under their control. 
  The leaders said they are seeking to establish socialism in 
Mexico through an armed struggle for which they have prepared 
for the past 24 years. 
  Reaching the territory occupied by the EZLN, which made its 
public appearance on 1 January, is no easy task, because there 
are several rebel checkpoints manned by Indians who speak 
Spanish with difficulty and collect a "war tax" of approximately 
$17 for each media vehicle crossing it. 
  The first EZLN checkpoints are about 25 km from San 
Cristobal 
de las Casas on the road to Ocosingo, in northern Chiapas State, 
which neighbors with Guatemala. 
  At those rebel checkpoints the guerrilla Indians are 
blocking 
access to Ocosingo, warning that civilians cannot go there, 
because EZLN and Mexican Army troops are clashing. 
  The rebels control about 65 km of highway, along which there 
are several checkpoints, up to the town of Altamirano, which has 
approximately 15,000 inhabitants. 
  "Eliseo," who is about 20 years old and who wears a ski cap, 
said that he has been a member of this organization for five 
years and that it has conducted exercises all over the country. 
He denied that the EZLN has ties to other armed movements 
abroad. 
  "It is we Mexicans who organized: there are teachers, 
peasants, and laborers among our companeros. There are also 
church people; we are mostly Catholic," Eliseo said when 
interviewed at the rebel checkpoint in Huistan. 
  "If the government wants negotiation, we will reject it; we 
want them to leave leadership in the people's hands," he added. 
  Along the road leading to Ocosingo, where fierce clashes are 
taking place according to various sources, people can be seen 
fleeing with their belongings on their backs in search of an 
escape route. 
  The rebels, who are visibly nervous, are closely monitoring 
every movement in the area, especially vehicles, and are ready 
to fire. 
  In Oxchuc, which has about 37,000 inhabitants and is also 
under subversives' control, the residents are quietly 
complaining about the situation, because they are unable to 
leave town in public transportation vehicles, because the EZLN 
has "borrowed" them. 
  Oxchuc resident Ruperto Jimenez said that that town only has 
enough food for three days and that people fear for their lives 
if there were Army-rebel clashes. 
  "We are EZLN members in honor of our hero Emiliano Zapata 
(leader of the 1910 revolution), and we are seeking to impose 
socialism," said a rebel "captain" stationed in Cuxulja. 
  The rebel, who identified himself as "captain," is about 1.6 
meters tall and armed with an AK-47 rifle. He said that his 
organization was established in the city in 1969 and was later 
transferred to the mountains, where "we became guerrillas and 
are now an army." 
  In Altamira the rebels have occupied the square and a 
hospital run by nuns of the congregation Sisters of Charity, who 
are taking care of eight men, six rebels, and two policemen 
injured during combat. 
  Planes and Mexican Air Force helicopters frequently overfly 
the conflict area.

  [Text] Mexico City, 3 Jan (EFE) -- The former Revolutionary 
Workers Clandestine People's Union Party (Procup) dissociated 
itself from the rebel Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN), 
which has revolted in Chiapas State, Mexico. 
  Maria Vera, a former Procup member imprisoned since 1990, 
said in statements published by the newspaper EL FINANCIERO 
today, Monday, that Procup backs the EZLN armed movement 
although it has no relations with them. "The EZLN has our 
acceptance and moral support. We are sure other armed groups 
will salute, in their own way, the struggle of the companions in 
Chiapas," she stated. 
  The government's only option is a political one. The 
situation will become very critical if it represses the EZLN and 
the people of Chiapas, she added. In her opinion, the 
government is interested in presenting an image of a country 
with social and political stability due to the start up of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This is the only 
explanation for the government's willingness to negotiate with 
the rebels, Vera added. 
  She believes the EZLN's appearance is one of the most 
important events for the armed struggle in Mexico, and she 
warned that the confrontations in Chiapas could generate similar 
actions in other parts of the country. "This is due to the fact 
that there are large sectors of the population that live under 
conditions of extreme poverty similar to those in Chiapas," the 
former guerrilla said. It will be very difficult, she said, for 
the government to choose an increase in "its low-intensity war 
against the people and to annihilate the Zapatist army, as such 
actions would have a high political cost." 
  Vera revealed that she had heard reports on the formation of 
a guerrilla movement--although it had not proclaimed itself as 
the EZLN--in the Chiapas region for several years. She said 
that the clashes in Chiapas could prompt rebel movements to 
arise in Mexico; events have shown that the EZLN has an 
authentic belligerent character in the country. 
  Procup has its roots in the guerrilla movements that 
developed in the southern State of Guerrero during the 1970's. 
The group was allegedly headed by former Oaxaca University 
Director Felipe Martinez Soriano, who is imprisoned for his 
responsibility in the attack against the Mexican newspaper LA 
JORNADA, in which two guards lost their lives, in April 1990.

<F P=106> ["Special Report" by Rosie Ahuatxil from the Government </F>
Secretariat in Mexico City] 
  [Text] The Government Secretariat reports that the 
situation in Chiapas State is one of greater calm now and that 
the incidents there have not led to disturbances in the other 
states of the country. 
  Under Secretary Socorro Diaz Palacios has said that during 
the last few months of 1993 there was information about illegal 
activities by small groups in that border area, but the special 
circumstances of the region's underdevelopment forced the 
authorities to act with special prudence and caution; 
nevertheless, Socorro Diaz Palacios added, the situation is 
returning to normal in Chiapas State. Here is what she said: 
  [Begin Diaz recording] In San Cristobal de las Casas and 
Ocosingo, two of the four municipal capitals that were violently 
attacked, the situation is of greater calm now. They are free 
of the aggressor groups, and civilian authorities are on the way 
to fully assuming their duties. These events have not produced 
any disturbances in the other states of the Republic. [end 
recording] 
  Diaz said also that the local authorities' response was to 
protect the civilian population and that the Mexican Army, with 
great prudence, did not act the first day. The authorities did 
not execute actions whose consequences might have led to the 
loss of more civilian lives in these towns. Diaz said something 
interesting; she said the violent groups that are acting in 
Chiapas State present a mixture of both national and foreign 
interests and individuals. They show an affinity toward other 
violent factions that operate in brother countries of Central 
America. Some Indians, Diaz said, have been recruited and 
pressured by the leaders of these groups, and their historic 
demands, which must continue to be heard, have undoubtedly been 
manipulated. The Federal Government, she said, has affirmed 
that its conduct will continue to be based on the law and in the 
defense of the people's security. It has also reiterated to all 
the inhabitants of the region the proposal for dialogue to 
further advance in providing attention to the needs of that and 
other state regions.

  [Text] Mexico City, 3 Jan (AFP) -- The Mexican Army has 
12,000 soldiers who are "trying to repel the uprising" of 
Indians of the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN), initiated 
on 1 January in the southern State of Chiapas, the newspaper 
ULTIMAS NOTICIAS reported this Monday. 
  The Armed Forces have reinforced their troops with 6,000 
soldiers in the area of conflict, where there were already a 
number of soldiers prior to the EZLN-launched offensive, the 
newspaper stated, not citing its sources. 
  This report has not yet been officially confirmed. 
  According to Chiapas authorities, the guerrillas "are just a 
few," possibly some 400, but estimates made by journalists who 
have traveled to the region list the EZLN members at between 800 
and 1,000. 
  A guerrilla has told the press that his troops consist of 
approximately 5,000 men. 
  The area of conflict is located approximately 700 km south 
of 
Mexico City.

<F P=106> ["Special Report" by Elizabeth Diaz Sotero from the official </F>
Los Pinos presidential residence--live] 
  [Text] Social Development Secretary Carlos Rojas Gutierrez 
met with President Carlos Salinas here at Los Pinos this 
afternoon. After that meeting, Rojas read before local and 
foreign media representatives a three-page communique admitting 
that there is a significant social and ancestral 
underdevelopment in Chiapas State. 
  He assured that this state occupied first place in the 
government's social investment over the past five years. Rojas 
said that the secretariat under his responsibility--that is, the 
Social Development Secretariat--by order of President Salinas 
will continue its dialogue with various social organizations of 
the jungle area, the Chiapas border area, Catholic Church 
bishops, and members of other churches to continue projects that 
have been carried out in the past few years. These projects 
were defined by the authorities mainly with the participation of 
regional social groups. Let's listen to a portion of the 
communique that Secretary Rojas read this afternoon at Los Pinos: 
  [Begin Rojas recording] Due to the violent incidents that 
occurred on 1 January, the government of the Republic reaffirms 
its willingness to establish new means to settle the problems of 
the jungle area and border areas of that state; in this regard, 
President Carlos Salinas has instructed us to make additional 
efforts to reach this goal. 
  A group of officials will visit Chiapas State to establish a 
discussion table, along with Governor (Elmar Checher), to 
address the regional social problems, to review, along with the 
various social organizations, the progress made by the agreed 
upon works, to review technical files, to (?discuss) production 
works and projects that will be carried out, and to define new 
actions for this year, as was agreed upon previously with 
regional groups. 
  I would like to point out that for the Federal Government 
Chiapas State is top priority. We know of the ancestral social 
underdevelopment affecting it, and this is why it occupies first 
place in social investment of the national Solidarity Program. 
During the past five years of the current administration, 
Chiapas received 8 percent of the total national investment. 
Social investment grew by more than 1,000 percent during this 
period. [end recording] 
  Secretary Rojas mentioned some figures reflecting the 
magnitude of the efforts made in the past years. Eighty 
first-rate centers and rural medical units and hospitals in 
Huitzla and Mapastepec were built. More than 4,000 schools were 
incorporated into the (Digna) school program, and 1,900 school 
rooms and 108 laboratories were built. About 3,000 km of roads 
and highways were built. More than 1,200 communities and 
low-income settlements have electricity today. Five hundred 
water and drainage systems were built and rehabilitated in 65 
municipalities. More than 90,000 peasants received credits 
without collateral [credito a la palabra] to cultivate 150,000 
hectares. The 110 town councils of the state have municipality 
funds from the Solidarity Program to meet the people's most 
urgent needs. Nineteen regional Indian funds were established 
to support the production projects of the ethnic groups. 
  Carlos Rojas added that to face the drop in the 
international 
price of coffee--a problem that has worsened economic problems 
in the Chiapas highlands--the government has supported 60,000 
growers who face this difficult situation. The secretary said 
that in Chiapas there has been a willingness to hold talks and 
conciliatory efforts; he added that this has led to the solution 
of agrarian problems such as those in Venustiano Carranza, 
Simojovel, and (Huiztiupan). 
  Rojas said that there was progress in the efforts to reach a 
consensus with the groups residing near the jungle and its 
original inhabitants. This unprecedented effort, according to 
Carlos Rojas, has reduced the number of landless peasants in 
Chiapas State. Let's continue to listen to Secretary Rojas: 
  [Begin Rojas recording] Despite the great efforts made by 
the state and federal governments and by the state social 
groups, there are areas where demographic growth and the 
deterioration of natural resources have worsened social 
problems. [end recording] 
  Secretary Rojas read the document and left the Venustiano 
Carranza Room with no other comment.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 3 Jan (AFP) -- 
According to various sources, the Zapata National Liberation 
Army (EZLN) is maintaining a guerrilla presence today in at 
least five towns of the southern State of Chiapas, leaving four 
mayors offices violently occupied in the past few days. 
  Rafael Gonzalez Lastra, the Chiapas Government secretary 
general, has told a news conference that the EZLN "aggressors" 
left the mayors offices in Las Margaritas and Chanal today and 
that Mexican Army troops are in the city of Comitan, south of 
San Cristobal, to guarantee peace. 
  The EZLN forces violently seized the mayors offices in San 
Cristobal de las Casas, Las Margaritas, Chanal, Altamirano, and 
Ocosingo on 1 January in what constituted a violent guerrilla 
outbreak. 
  The guerrillas left San Cristobal on 2 January and moved 
toward Rancho Nuevo, where they have sustained several clashes 
with the troops stationed at the 31st Military Zone Garrison. 
  The EZLN presence continues in Ocosingo, where there have 
been clashes, and Altamirano, Oxchuch, Huiztan, and Cuxulja, 
which they occupied on Sunday. 
  Certain reports stated that a group of rebels has taken over 
Guadalupe Tepeyac, in Las Margaritas Municipality. 
  Gonzalez Lastra said he trusts that order will be 
reestablished in Ocosingo and Altamirano "within the next few 
hours." 
  Media reports, which authorities have not confirmed, state 
that the troops arrested 12 civilians in Comitan. Near the city 
an EZLN unit kidnapped former Chiapas Governor Absalon 
Castellanos on Sunday. His whereabouts are unknown.

  [Text] Comitan (Mexico), 3 Jan (EFE) -- The Zapata National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) withdrew today from Las Margaritas, 
Chiapas State, and announced a summary trial against former 
Governor Absalon Castellanos Dominguez. 
  The rebels controlled Las Margaritas after occupying the 
town 
on 1 January and withdrew early on 3 January, journalists who 
arrived there after they had left told EFE. 
  The journalists said when leaving the town they saw the 
corpses of Police Commander Berlain Perez Perez and a guerrilla 
at the Union de Uniones Building. 
  A rebel identified as "Major Moises" told the journalists 
that General Castellanos, who was kidnapped on 2 January, will 
be judged in a summary trial at their general garrison for 
"repressing the people." 
  "He will not be freed. He already enjoyed freedom and will 
be executed," the rebel told the journalists who managed to 
enter Las Margaritas. 
  He reiterated that his organization "will remain armed and 
will fight to the death. We are determined. We are not 
demanding negotiations; we have declared war on the Army." 
  Meanwhile, the almost 120,000 inhabitants of Comitan are 
living hours of terror tonight, fearing the town, located 15 
minutes from Las Margaritas, could be attacked by the rebels 
posted in the surrounding areas. 
  Helicopters and "Pilatus" type planes are constantly 
overflying Comitan, and the Army has reinforced security in 
public buildings and access roads to the city.

  [Text] Peasant organizations of the Permanent Agrarian 
Congress [Congreso Agrario Permanente] rejected today the 
outbreak of violence in Chiapas State but agreed in saying that 
the armed struggle is the result of the poverty and neglect in 
which the peasants from that region must live. 
  Jose Luis Gonzalez Aguilera, coordinator of the Permanent 
Agrarian Congress, has said that the problems of the Indian 
groups will not be resolved with weapons but admitted that the 
violence that prevails in Chiapas is the product of increased 
poverty and, often, the systematic repression that these social 
groups have had to endure. 
  Gonzalez did not disregard the possibility of the Zapata 
National Liberation Army being led by Guatemalan guerrillas. 
  Meanwhile, Jose Luis Hernandez, a peasant leader from the 
Independent Central Organization of Agricultural Workers and 
Peasants [CIOAC], has said that the problem can be resolved by 
establishing a truce between the government and the armed group. 
  [Begin Hernandez recording] We completely reject an Army 
intervention to give this matter any kind of military or police 
treatment, because this is not what this is about. These people 
are not criminals committing a crime; they are human beings 
demanding justice. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Alvaro Lopez, a leader of the National Union of 
Agricultural Workers [UNTA], and Ignacio Iris Salomon, of 
(Coduc) [not further identified] has called on the parties to 
resolve the armed conflict as soon as possible, because it 
represents a threat to the country's social stability on the eve 
of the August 1994 federal elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Rosi Ahuatxil] </F>
  [Text] Chiapas Governor (Elmar Checher) has requested the 
protection of the powers of the union and the intervention of 
the Mexican Army to settle once and for all the violence 
prevailing in the State of Chiapas and, of course, to prevent 
more bloodshed. 
  (Checher) has said that the government's concern has been to 
make the civilian population a priority, and this is why the 
national Army had not intervened earlier as the subversives were 
occupying San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  He urged the people to act prudently to avoid being 
controlled by panic and rumors and to facilitate the work of the 
national Army to reinforce the protection and security of the 
affected towns. 
  (Checher) has said that government efforts to establish a 
dialogue have not been well received, and this shall be 
construed as defiance and contempt toward the institutions; 
this, he added, has changed his attitude on the actions that 
should be adopted to immediately restore order, peace, and 
tranquility, which have always prevailed in the State of Chiapas. 
  Thus, the governor has urged the population to remain calm. 
He said that with the government's leadership, Chiapas society 
will continue to improve its standard of living with strength, 
firmness, and enthusiasm, and with the dignity of a people who 
know where they are headed, because they have a well-defined 
course and fate. 
  This was the message of encouragement issued by the governor 
of Chiapas State to his people.

  [Text] Mexico City, 3 Jan (AFP) -- A government source has 
reported that the Mexican Armed Forces retook control of the 
town of Ocosingo in southern Chiapas State this afternoon. It 
had been under the control of Zapata National Liberation Army 
(EZLN) guerrillas since 1 January. 
  Chiapas Government Under Secretary Julio Cesar Cancino has 
told television media that Altamirano is the only town in the 
hands of the "criminals" (guerrillas). The official did not 
provide details on the recovery of Ocosingo or the number of 
Army and rebel casualties during more than 24 hours of fighting. 
  The authorities have only admitted the presence of EZLN 
rebels in four municipal capitals (San Cristobal, Ocosingo, Las 
Margaritas, and Altamirano). Meanwhile, media sources has 
reported there was guerrilla presence in five other towns: 
Chanal, Oxchuc, Huiztan, Cuxulja, and Rancho Nuevo. Cancino 
said that the Mexican Army is protecting the highways leading to 
Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, where "many rumors" 
have been heard about the activities of EZLN members. 
  He stressed the possibility that the strife-torn situation 
in 
Chiapas as a result of the violent appearance of the EZLN will 
end 4 January.

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez (Mexico), 4 Jan (EFE) -- The Armed 
Forces have recovered four towns that had been occupied by the 
Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN) after 48 hours of clashes 
and skirmishes that unofficially have left almost 200 people 
dead and 500 injured. 
  The rebels left their positions in Oxchuc and Las 
Margaritas, 
while the Mexican Army expelled them from San Cristobal and 
Oconsingo, in northern and northeastern Chiapas State. 
  Sources close to the Chiapas government have told EFE that 
it 
can be said unofficially that 200 people were killed, including 
rebels, civilians, and soldiers, and 500 were wounded during the 
past three days of conflict since the EZLN attacked several 
towns in Chiapas. 
  They added that 25 rebels were captured during the military 
operations and that apparently one of them is "Commander 
Marcos," who appeared in a picture talking to the press at the 
San Cristobal mayor's office, which was reproduced by Mexican 
newspapers.

  [Text] Chilean Ambassador to Moscow James Holger said 
Chilean trade with Russia might increase through the sale of 
wines to that country. The diplomat returned to the country due 
to health problems and took advantage of the opportunity to 
place his resignation at the government's disposal. Regarding 
our bilateral relations with Russia and the possibilities of 
increasing trade, Holger said prospects are good and we are 
working together with Chilean entrepreneurs in this area. Holger 
pointed out the recent signing of contracts with the Corpora 
firm for the sale of instant coffee and powdered juice, adding 
that other nontraditional industries such as the shoe industry 
also are working to enter the Russian market. Good Chilean grape 
juice also will be tried on federation tables, James Holger said: 
  [Begin recording] I had a meeting with Felipe Benavente, 
Santa Rita vineyard's sales manager, in Moscow just before 
leaving. His visit was very successful. We have very good 
chances of placing high-quality table wine in St. Petersburg and 
Moscow supermarkets and four- and five-star hotels. At a time 
markets for our wine are shrinking elsewhere, the Russian market 
offers good opportunities, not spectacularly good, but good 
nonetheless. [end recording] 
  Regarding the internal political situation, Holger said it 
is 
complex and difficult: 
  [Begin recording] The situation is in a permanent state of 
change. It is not known where things are going sometimes. The 
economic reform plan is going ahead, stumbling ahead I would 
say, but it is proceeding. I do not think there will be a return 
to the past as many people fear. What might happen is a slowing 
down of the reform process, which was perhaps implemented with 
excessive zeal. The parliamentary election was clean. Thousands 
of foreign observers saw what happened. [end recording] 
  Mistakes were made when implementing the policy to transform 
the country from a centralized economy to a market economy. 
Excessive emphasis was placed on monetary aspects, Holger said, 
adding that at present the trend is to work more on social 
programs.

<F P=106> [Article by Luciano Suassuna and Daniel Stycer with the </F>
"cooperation" of Raymundo Costa from Brasilia, Otavio Lage and 
Sonia Neri from Belo Horizonte, and Francisco Alves Filho from 
Rio de Janeiro] 
  [Text] On 9 December, President Itamar Franco left Brasilia 
in a bout of rebelliousness. During his time in Rio de Janeiro 
and Juiz de Fora, Franco demonstrated his mercurial temperament 
by assailing journalists, cancelling speeches, bypassing 
official security procedures, and commenting to his friends that 
he wants to quit the presidency and settle down in Minas Gerais. 
Unlike former President Jose Sarney [1985-90], Franco does not 
like the ritual of the presidency -- the set of formalities with 
which the president must necessarily comply. He made a point of 
displaying this over the past 10 days. As one of Franco's aides 
noted: "He likes to be treated like an ordinary citizen." 
  How can a president behave like an ordinary citizen or 
overlook the damage this may cause the country at an especially 
delicate moment? During the same week that Franco insisted on 
behaving like an ordinary citizen, the Chamber of Deputies and 
the Federal Supreme Court removed those guilty of corruption 
from office. The Legislative and Judicial Branches thus 
recovered part of the credibility they had lost. The 
president's trip to Rio de Janeiro and Juiz de Fora was seen in 
Brasilia as a lack of interest in power. "The Executive Branch 
must exhibit an element of peace in the institutions," said Luis 
Eduardo Magalhaes (BA) [Bahia], the PFL [Liberal Front Party] 
leader in the Chamber of Deputies. Franco was holed up meanwhile 
at the Gloria Hotel in Rio de Janeiro avoiding his main official 
duty at this juncture, namely to negotiate the passing of 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic package in 
Congress. He did discharge some less important duties, such as 
installing two new ministers -- Social Security Minister Sergio 
Cutolo and Culture Minister Luiz Nascimento Silva. These 
appointments do not seem to have been preceded by substantial 
politico-partisan negotiations. He also met Deputy Roberto 
Freire (PPS-PE) [People's Socialist Party-Pernambuco], who 
resigned as government leader in the Chamber of Deputies because 
he disagreed with the economic plan. Free from the rigid 
structure of rules and protocol at Planalto Palace, the 
president ate pizza in the early hours in Rio de Janeiro and 
played piano during the evening in Juiz de Fora. Thus began one 
of the most astonishing weeks in his 15 months at the head of 
the presidency. 
  Franco arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 9 December. The 
following day he participated in a ceremony at the War College. 
Before sunset he left the Gloria Hotel on his first rebellious 
foray of the week. Accompanied by Minister Mauro Durante, 
secretary general of the Presidency, and his nephew Ariosto 
Franco, the president took to the road. After a nearly two-hour 
drive he arrived at his apartment on Rio Branco Avenue in 
downtown Juiz de Fora. By virtue of his post, these trips must 
be made by plane, the presidential plane, or by car -- an 
official car in a motorcade. The government delegation, 
meanwhile, remained at the Gloria Hotel. 
  The absence of an armed escort for the head of state was 
instrumental in causing the first major incident of his weekend. 
Franco left his apartment of Juiz de Fora at 1600 local time on 
12 December to visit his former mother-in-law, Zila, some 10 km 
from downtown Juiz de Fora. Realizing he was being followed by 
the press, Franco ordered the driver of his Monza car to go 
faster. The driver ran a red light. Arriving at his 
destination, Franco kicked the car door open. He lunged at 
reporters, snatching the camera parasol of Rede Bandeirantes 
Television and grabbing the flash from an O GLOBO photographer. 
"Have you no respect for others?" growled the head of state. 
"Please clear off, this is private property," he added. 
  This was Franco's second incident with the press in Juiz de 
Fora. On All Souls' Day, he charged at a Rede Globo Television 
cameraman filming Franco's visit to the tomb of his mother, 
Italia Cauterio Franco. According to Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes 
(PSDB) [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]: "This behavior shows 
he is a tortured man," adding: "There is no excuse for this 
behavior." Politicians have always been aware of the 
president's oscillating behavior. But he has never exhibited it 
with such force as he did over the last few days, thus 
increasing the number of those who fear a disruption in the 
democratic system of government and those who fear Franco will 
resign. During an improvised news conference, Franco told 
journalists: "If we manage to weather these three coming months 
(until the end of March, by which time presidential candidacies 
will have been defined) in democracy, respecting the 
Constitution, and if I manage to hand over power to my 
successor, I will be satisfied with myself." The fact that the 
president included democracy in his conditional sentence 
strengthens the conviction of those who exemplify the idea of 
sutlers. 
  According to a group of friends and politicians, the fear 
the president may resign -- which could trigger an institutional 
rupture -- is also based on other indications. A friend of the 
president from Brasilia said: "I talk with him every day and he 
always says he is tired and going home." Franco talked about 
this issue the week before he went to Rio de Janeiro. His 
friend from Brasilia made the following interpretation: "It 
does not necessarily mean resignation but these are the real 
feelings of a man tired of power who lacks a private life." His 
resignation is, however, possible. In his political career, 
Franco resigned only once, when he left the presidency of a CPI 
[Congressional Investigating Committee] on nuclear energy under 
the Geisel administration. Every other time he held public 
office, with the exception of one of the two times he was 
prefect of Juiz de Fora, he talked about resigning every time he 
faced a crisis. During the electoral campaign, he threatened to 
leave Collor's electoral ticket three times. During the 
presidency he talked about it when he completed one year in 
office. In an interview, he admitted he was thinking of 
resigning. Doubting that it was possible, leading politicians 
checked the Constitution to find the legal alternatives to a 
presidential resignation. Deputy Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party--Rio Grande do Sul] was 
asked by military advisers about this possibility. The 
Constitution establishes that Congress must indirectly choose a 
name to complete the Collor/Franco presidential term. In the 
Chamber of Deputies, some deputies already have their 
candidates, among them, Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) 
[Progressive Renewal Party--Parana Sate]. 
  This is not the first time -- and will not be the last -- 
that the president has shown his lack of patience with the job 
and his inability to move the pieces of the political game at a 
time when Congress is weak. Two months ago when deputies and 
senators installed the budget CPI, Franco told them he would not 
oppose an agreement to hold early elections. The governor of 
Ceara, surprised by the president's remarks, returned early from 
Washington -- where he signed agreements with the Inter-American 
Development Bank -- to meet Franco. The governor suggested that 
Franco should fill the political vacuum created by the 
accusations against congressmen. "Better not," said Franco, "it 
may seem opportunistic." 
  For a group of the president's direct advisers, his apathy 
has become an undeniable element. For example, the week the 
budget scandal emerged, Franco prepared a 12-page speech that 
was to have been delivered on radio and television network for 
18 minutes. One individual involved in this project said: "It 
was a speech to fill the institutional vacuum." The president 
would have said: "The people have ethical values," unlike some 
deputies and senators involved in the accusations. Franco also 
was to have talked about education and other projects. One 
adviser said: "He cancelled the speech because he was afraid of 
touching members of the government." Two of his ministers were 
on the list to be investigated. Following this first 
cancellation, the president cancelled two other speeches. 
  In a week characterized by Franco's outspoken behavior, the 
government also revealed its lack of political course because of 
what the president did not say. In Rio, for example, Franco 
canceled his participation in the ceremony to award swords to 
the Naval School marines on 20 December. It was officially said 
that the president's presence would not be necessary. The truth 
is that Franco did not attend because he had prepared a dramatic 
speech calling for a moderation of radical political positions. 
Franco feared that his speech during a military ceremony would 
be interpreted as something coordinated with the position 
expressed by the Army chief of staff the week before. Franco 
was unaware beforehand of the speech by General Benedito Leonel, 
who referred to political issues. 
  His absence at the military ceremony seems to have 
contributed to calming things down after the crisis that emerged 
the week before. By issuing only a simple declaration supporting 
the finance minister since the economic plan was announced two 
weeks ago, the president cooperated with the criticisms made of 
the economic team. Under pressure from the lack of political 
support from Planalto Palace, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso already is thinking of carrying out the stages of the 
plan ahead of time. For example, he could introduce the URV 
[Real Value Unit] on 1 January, 30 days before the initial date. 
Economist Edmar Bracha, the minister's special adviser, told a 
friend in confidence that he has become the main target of 
criticisms of the plan, and that he may leave the government 
next month. 
  According to the presidential advisers, the president's 
desire to resign reportedly came from a double disappointment in 
addition to complaints from his family. In the political field, 
he reportedly is disappointed with several people he knows whose 
names are being investigated by the budget CPI. In the economic 
field, Franco reportedly realized that nothing else remains for 
him to do except support Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's 
economic plan. "Fire him to do what?" asked Franco during a 
recent conversation with a congressman. He admitted: "I don't 
have much time." For example, Franco disagrees with the 
dollarization proposed by the minister and does not want to 
suggest breaking up oil and telecommunications monopolies in a 
constitutional reform. Therefore, he had to swallow the two 
measures. 
  "I am personally against breaking up those monopolies, but I 
will not oppose the measure if Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
proposes it," Franco told journalists accompanying him to Brasao 
restaurant in Juiz de Fora, where he had dinner at 0100 on 
Friday after his speech at the Viana College graduation ceremony 
at his daughter Georgiana's graduation from law school. The 
family complaints come from the president's two daughters: 
Fabiana and Georgiana. During his conversation with journalists 
at the Brasao restaurant, the president was asked to request 
Faviana's opinion, as an economist, about her father's 
government. "Her comments are unpublishable," Franco said. "This 
is why I have a sociologist instead of an economist at the 
Finance Ministry." Both daughters demand more attention. They 
have been to Brasilia only twice since their father took power. 
On one of those occasions the president complained about not 
being advised of his daughter's visit in time and because he was 
afraid his private life would be exposed. 
  The most curious episode revealing Itamar Franco's 
rebellious 
attitude took place on Tuesday night. According to Attorney Jose 
De Castro, president of Telerj [Rio de Janeiro Telephone 
Company], Franco told his security guards at bedtime that he 
would not leave the Gloria Hotel. The protection plan was 
deactivated and only one guard stayed in the 10th-floor 
corridor. At around 0100, Itamar Franco told the security 
officer he would go to Mauro Durante's room. But it was a lie. 
The president went to the lobby, where he met Castro. The couple 
walked past two cameramen sleeping in the entrance and went out. 
Franco jumped into Jose de Castro's car and drove toward the 
pizza parlor in Botafogo. Franco ordered a tomato and cheese 
pizza and drank two beers. Castro ate a tomato, cheese, and ham 
pizza and drank four beers. They were not bothered, not even by 
the couple kissing each other at one of the tables. "There was 
no one around us. I believe the youngsters doubted the president 
could have escaped from his hotel to eat pizza," Jose de Castro 
said amusedly. "We left the pizza parlor at 0230 and returned to 
the Gloria Hotel," Castro added. 
  Less than 48 hours later the president repeated the scene at 
a Juiz de Fora restaurant. Twice after participating in his 
daughter's graduation ceremony Franco walked to the piano where 
professor Maria Tereza Laidersnaider, from the Music 
Conservatory, was playing classical and romantic music, cheering 
up the night at the Brasao Restaurant. At the end Franco played 
together with the professor. He is convinced of the success of 
changing habits and might repeat the experience in the coming 
weeks. "Many people complained that he stayed in Brasilia too 
much," Jose De Castro said. "Now he has gone to Rio de Janeiro 
and he will return." The Gloria Hotel presidential suite has 500 
square meters, five rooms, a dining room, a sitting room, a bar, 
and a support kitchen. The walls are decorated with French silk, 
the sheets are of special linen, and towels are hand 
embroidered. The official cost is 50,600 cruzeiros a day. 
Besides increasing his visits to Rio de Janeiro, Franco's 
friends intend to work out a visit abroad. The official purpose 
would be unimportant because the real purpose would be to give 
Franco some 20 days of rest. 
  Whenever he has to have a tete-a-tete with somebody, 
President Franco sits down on the person's right and stretches 
his neck up a little. This is an old habit of his that goes 
back to the time when he ran for governor of Minas Gerais in 
1986. He told his friends then that he could not hear very 
well. During the election campaign in 1989, he began wearing a 
tiny hearing aid, strategically hidden under locks of hair, to 
be able to face the election marathon. The hearing aid 
disappeared after delicate microsurgery in Rio de Janeiro at the 
beginning of 1990. "His hearing is normal and is being checked 
by audiometric tests," states the president's physician at 
Planalto Palace, Carlos Alberto Farias. 
  Besides this hearing deficiency, which has been totally 
overcome now, the president's health does not have major 
problems other than the ones common among 62-year-old people who 
have an exacting work schedule and high stress levels. The 
control of cholesterol levels, which is also common among people 
his age, obliges the president to follow a spartan diet. Franco 
takes vitamins A, B, and C, besides capsules of a vitamin 
complex recommended for people his age, in order to prevent 
possible stress crises. When he was a senator, Franco had 
hepatitis-A, which left him with a liver condition. 
  The overtaxing situations the president has to confront by 
virtue of the post he holds do not affect him clinically. But 
they clearly disturb him emotionally, as noticed by some of his 
friends from Juiz de Fora and Brasilia. One of them says: "In 
private, he has never been different from the way he is at 
Planalto Palace." "Itamar has always been very insecure and 
prone to outbursts of anger. Sometimes he argued with me on 
account of the most insignificant thing and the next day he 
behaved as if nothing had happened," says Lisle Lucena, with the 
authority of somebody who had a love affair with the president 
for four years. Franco is a veritable romantic in his dealings 
with women. He cannot restrain his jealousy, he writes poems, 
and sends roses on special events. Lucena comments that Franco 
did not want to become "emotionally involved" with his 
girlfriends. 
  "That was the case with me; with Eleonora, Senator Jarbas 
Passarinho's daughter; and even with his former wife, Anna 
Elisa, who asked for a divorce because Franco did not share 
anything with her," Lucena said. 
  His usual comment: "I wish I could change everything for a 
net and a straw cigar," repeatedly mentioned by the president as 
the subject of jokes by many, including some of his old friends. 
"He is of Casa Jose Silva's type. Take three and pay for two," 
jokes a Juiz de Fora legislator. At parties, he hates to be 
called president and when someone makes the mistakes of calling 
him that he begs: "Please, call me Itamar." 
  Franco gives Palacio da Alvorada employees the same 
provincial treatment and rejects the most human temptations. He 
detests shrimp, lobster, and codfish. He loves Minas Gerais 
cheese and never rejects a Campari -- his only alcoholic 
concession besides the traditional draft beer in Juiz de Fora's 
bars. He is a real frustration to gourmets because of these 
gastronomic restrictions. His private cook, Helio Antion Alves, 
is lauded only when he cooks chicken with okra or bug bear 
Minas' style. "He only likes the usual steak with rice, beans, 
and cold sweet potatoes," complains Alves. Every morning the 
cook and housekeeper Raimunda Teles prepare the indispensable 
presidential vitamin composed of papaya and orange. 
  The habit of leaving at the most inappropriate moments is 
explained by Franco in a simple way. "I am like a bird who does 
not sing when he changes. I need privacy and isolation," he told 
a friend after scaring off the photographers in front of his 
former mother-in-law's home in Juiz de Fora on 12 December. "The 
day we started dating he was surprised when I asked him about 
his car. He went to pick me up on foot and we ended up going out 
in my Volkswagen," Lisle commented. When his former girlfriend 
did not want to drive and the couple could not go out, Franco 
would say: "Then we can sit on the sidewalk and talk."

<F P=106> [Speech by President Fidel Castro closing the Sixth Congress </F>
of the Union of Cuban Journalists, UPEC, at the Convention 
Center in Havana on 24 December --recorded] 
  [Text] In view of the late hour and the fact that this 
session has lasted for almost 15 hours of intense activity -- 
and, in my opinion, truly productive work -- I am very glad to 
have spoken at diverse moments, because this gives me the 
opportunity to be as brief as possible now. 
  I take responsibility for what I have said, at least for 
everything I have said, and I do not ask you for any kind of 
discretion. I believe that I spoke both carefully and freely. 
This time I am not going to ask for any discretion at all. I 
believe that regarding what [Politburo member Carlos] Lage said 
-- he presented more specific data -- it would be have to be 
thought through a bit more; but I think that, in general, it can 
also be reported [words indistinct] that material but, I repeat, 
we have to see again in writing what kinds of things are more or 
less fitting to be reported or not. [Sighs] 
  I have already expressed my opinion of the debates. The 
truth 
is that we all feel pleased with the development of the 
congress. We are happy, we are very happy. We truly feel 
committed to this congress. 
  Many important ideas and concepts have been debated. Marti 
has been mentioned on several occasions. I was thinking about 
Marti's words and truly believe that he was referring to the 
media in general. I believe he was referring to the media of his 
time, the U.S. media. I do not think he was referring to or 
describing the revolutionary media. The question I asked myself 
was: What would Marti do in these circumstances? How would Marti 
think? What would he say of the role of the media in these 
circumstances? What would he say of the revolutionary media? 
  I do not think that he would say anything different than you 
have said here, which will remain as important premises. It was 
evidenced here that your most important mission is to defend the 
Revolution. To defend the Revolution is to defend socialism. 
When we speak of this Revolution, I cannot think of it without 
socialism. They are inseparable. 
  I view the media as, let us say, a force, a formidable 
instrument of the Revolution. I see the media and think of Radio 
Rebelde in the Sierra Maestra. We are living during times that 
are no easier to endure than the Sierra Maestra days. We are 
living in more complex times, more complex than the ones in 
which we lived back then. I view the media as a force of 
enormous importance, a decisive force. They are truly a decisive 
force in this struggle we are waging, in which everything is at 
stake. We are not only putting our own work at stake, we are 
putting the work of all those generations that came before us at 
stake. We are also defending the inheritance of all those that 
will come after us. We have to see it from this point of view. 
  No doubts have been expressed here regarding the path of the 
Revolution; the Revolution has a leader, and the leader of the 
Revolution is the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC]. I believe that 
no one has disputed this idea. It is an essential principle. 
[Sighs] We are not living in normal times. It is not known when 
we will see normal times again. As was said here: Everything is 
susceptible to development, everything is susceptible to change. 
Remember that there were many people before us who thought of a 
revolution, social justice, equality, fraternity, and socialism. 
[Sighs] There was even the hope that the state would disappear 
someday, as would classes; that the state would disappear in a 
communist state. Today we see how far away a communist society 
is; how far away even the disappearance of the state is; how far 
away the disappearance of imperialism is. How long will we have 
to fight? 
  Almost 35 years have gone by since the triumph of the 
revolution, and many more since the struggle began. You can see 
that the conditions under which we must fight today are very 
difficult; you can see the difficult battle we must wage today. 
Therefore, I believe that the role of the party for a long time 
must be an important and essential role. The party must play a 
role in regard to our media. 
  Why do I say this? Well, it could be that the times in which 
we are living, the confusions that can occur, the current 
confusions, the issues being broached here could make some doubt 
the role of the party in regard to the media. I am not saying 
this because of you; I am saying this because of others who may 
have their doubts. 
  The Revolution must be directed by the party. Among the 
instruments of struggle, the media are an important instrument 
in the struggle. We discussed at length how the party should 
play that role in regard to the media. 
  We must also remember that our media are not privately 
owned. 
Let us say that the media are social property; they belong to 
the people. I believe some things will not be privatized, and 
the last thing we would privatize when socialism no longer 
existed would be the media. We know how the media work in the 
capitalist world. They have, simply put, their owners. The 
owners are the ones who rule the capitalist media. They are the 
ones making the decisions, the ones who appoint the directors, 
the ones who establish the political path. And something 
extremely hard and acknowledged by everyone: The international 
media belong to the international bourgeoisie. 
  The immense majority of the capitalist society media has a 
right-wing, reactionary character. Unfortunately, one of the 
tragedies of our era is that the mass media are in the hands of 
the economically strongest forces -- the wealthiest, essential, 
economic interests of those societies. I hear everyone say that, 
out of 15 or 20 newspapers, there are two or three that follow a 
fairly objective path; but the immense majority of the mass 
media is in the hands of the right-wing powers in the world. 
This is one of our tragedies, the fact that that mass media are 
used exhaustively against us. 
  This cannot serve as a model or example for us. Everything, 
in general, is marked by a commercial spirit. Those media have 
been allied to the forces that oppose socialism, progress, and 
the most progressive movements. Unfortunately, what we said of 
our media cannot be said of those media; those media are private 
property. We cannot state that they never tell a lie. We cannot 
state that they are always honest and objective in their 
reporting. One of the virtues of our media, ethics, cannot be 
ascribed to those media. 
  Logically, our media ought to be at the service of the 
people 
and the Revolution.I wanted to begin with this subject because 
it is an issue about which I harbor no doubts at all. 
  I mentioned this afternoon what I thought about the way our 
media ought to work. I said here that we had no fear whatsoever 
of the analysis of mistakes, of reporting bad news; rather we 
fear, for the reason I explained, having to omit reporting good 
news. 
  I am aware of the various debates and points of view and I 
believe nothing at all that has been said cannot be analyzed and 
debated. There is absolutely nothing regarding our media that 
cannot be improved or perfected. I believe that through an open 
discussion like the one we conducted here today we can truly 
attain our goals. I believe that, regarding the issue of 
relations between the party and the media, any type of problem 
between the party and the media can be solved. Any type of 
complaint that our journalists may have can be taken care of and 
can be resolved. As much as you like to provide it, the country 
needs the highest quality from the media. The country needs 
optimum work from the media, if it is possible to do optimum 
work. We do not have a congress, as we said earlier, every five 
years. I believe that the [Media] National Committee can meet 
with the PCC leadership, at the appropriate level, and I will be 
glad to participate also, whenever I have a chance, in that type 
of meeting to analyze any sort of problem. I believe that from 
this congress we should obtain greater attention to the media. 
  We should obtain better relations between the party and the 
media. This is fundamental. If we do not get the media to play 
an optimum role, then we will not win the battle of the special 
period. I do not see how we can win the battle of the special 
period without the efforts of the media, without the great 
ideological battle we must wage. We are truly involved in a 
great ideological battle. We cannot win this ideological battle 
with organization, conferences, the work of the members of the 
PCC and the Union of Young Communists, and the work of the mass 
organizations alone. The media must be in the front line of that 
battle. We need top quality media, high morale media, and media 
aware of the role they have to play in this struggle. 
  We have very serious problems. At a Central Committee 
meeting 
the other day, I was saying that no other generation that I can 
remember in the history of revolutions has had a harder or more 
difficult task than the one this generation has had to tackle. I 
cannot find a similar case in history. 
  I have found no other country facing a situation like the 
one we are facing. We are a small country in the hemisphere, 
confronting the strongest power in the world. It is not only 
powerful but arrogant, haughty, selfish, and relentless, and has 
for the past 35 years been trying to destroy us. It is a 
hegemonic power opportunistically attempting to crush us as 
quickly as possible, and even more quickly since the collapse of 
the socialist bloc. Our country is practically alone in this 
hemisphere, struggling under incredibly difficult economic 
conditions in times of crisis for the revolutionary movement, in 
times of crisis for the revolutionary ideology, in times when 
all means are being used to exult the values of capitalism; in 
times when capitalism has launched itself into new phases that 
we could now describe as total control of work, in times of the 
so-called globalization of economy. We who lost our allies; who 
are today more than ever suffering the effects of the blockade 
because we no longer have the support from abroad that we had 
for so many years; we who, based precisely on that support, 
built so many social and economic things that are today so 
difficult to maintain, cannot envision more difficult conditions. 
  We may have lost many things, but we have not lost our 
serenity, patriotism, revolutionary spirit, dignity, decorum, 
dignity, the memory of our heroes and our dead; we have not 
forgotten our memories of 1868 and the 10 years of war; we have 
not forgotten our memories of 1895 and the struggle of our 
people for approximately 100 years after the pseudoindependence. 
We have not lost our values. This is why the Revolution has been 
able to resist. There is no other way to explain it. I truly 
believe that in this area our country is writing a truly 
glorious page in history. We should all feel proud of what we 
are doing. Naturally, all these tremendous problems, the 
limitations, scarcity, and suffering experienced by our people 
today serve as a cultural medium to dishearten our people and 
weaken their faith. The domestic and external conditions promote 
all those political debates you were talking about, they promote 
the situation broached by our TRABAJADORES comrade when he said 
that today we are not working as we did when we had the support 
of almost all the people. 
  There is no doubt that the number of disheartened and 
pessimistic people must grow under these circumstances. The 
number of people who defect or betray the fatherland also grows. 
As we said recently, it is easy to be revolutionary in easy 
times, but it is truly difficult to be a revolutionary during 
truly difficult times. Those who are disheartened and 
demoralized, those who defect and betray do not surprise me; 
however, I am truly amazed by the extraordinary number of people 
who remain firm, with high morale and strong faith. I have 
witnessed this in many places and I saw it here today [words 
indistinct] statements made. Truly admirable. What is even more 
admirable is the degree of patriotism and revolutionary spirit 
exhibited by our people. [applause] We do not ignore the fact 
that we have difficulties. We do not ignore the fact that there 
is a certain ideological deterioration. We do not ignore that, 
to a greater or lesser degree, there is a certain disciplinary 
deterioration. 
  For example, there are a few thousand teachers who are now 
performing tasks other than teaching. There are some teachers 
who have transportation problems and it is difficult for them to 
get to the school. There are some teachers whose families earn 
enough to cover expenses. However, more than 250,000 professors 
and teachers keep our education system intact. They work at the 
universities, schools, and daycare centers. They work 
everywhere. There are millions of people who work because it is 
an honor to work. 
  Only recently I was thinking about an article carried in an 
issue of TRABAJADORES. As a matter of fact, the TRABAJADORES 
crew is doing an excellent ideological job. The TRABAJADORES 
article discussed moral and material encouragement. In principle 
and theory, the article cannot be refuted. However, I kept 
telling myself that in practice, our workers are working out of 
a strictly moral sense of duty. They are motivated by their 
morale, honor, and patriotism. We are in no condition to provide 
material encouragement. We have no doubt that material 
incentives are good; however, we do not have the money to do 
this. Whenever we have the money to improve a collective, we do 
it. The contingents are proof of this. We paid more attention to 
the workers, improved their housing facilities, gave them work 
clothes, gave them food. Proof of this are the measures 
implemented in the agriculture sector. We had been implementing 
those measures in the past; however, they had been affected by 
the scarcity of supplies and other material. Further proof of 
this is the creation of the Basic Cooperative Production Units 
[UBPC's] where we wish to apply the principle that the worker 
will receive in proportion to the work he does. This is a 
socialist principle. Proof of this are the measures implemented 
to ensure the self-sufficiency of the UBPC, the land we are 
distributing throughout the country to ensure self-sufficiency. 
Much of this land is in isolated areas. These are things we are 
doing to enable the people to contribute through their work to 
improving the self-sufficiency situation. Wherever we can 
provide material incentives, we do. But the objective truth is 
that we have practically nothing material to give our workers. 
  It is truly admirable, even though it has been described as 
good, that you have admitted we have absenteeism. There has 
always been absenteeism. Today we have more of it. However, the 
objective truth is that there are millions of men and women in 
this country who are working and fulfilling their duties out of 
a sense of honor and patriotism. That is why I keep telling 
myself: The issue is not giving the workers moral and material 
encouragement, but rather, keeping their morale very high. If we 
do not keep the people's morale very high, we will not win this 
battle. I would say that at this moment the battle is at its 
worst moment. We can say we are facing a situation similar to 
the one we faced when the enemy soldiers were marching on Radio 
Rebelde and our territory was getting smaller. We are truly 
engulfed in a desperate struggle for survival, but we have an 
army, because the revolutionaries represent a real army. When I 
speak of the army, I am not speaking of the Armed Forces; I am 
speaking of the revolutionary people who represent a real army, 
capable of winning this battle if we know how to lead them. How 
do I see you, the journalists? I see you as commissars of the 
people in this battle. [applause] 
  Yes, we must reverse trends, we must reverse currents. We 
have not reversed currents yet. We must all struggle: party, 
government, organizations, and Armed Forces. Not a military 
Armed Forces, but an armed forces helping in the field of 
agriculture, as it is doing, and by cutting back on expenses. 
The Armed Forces has reduced its budget by 50 percent. Tens of 
thousands of soldiers are helping produce food, and we are not 
talking about self-sufficiency, which is one of the tasks we 
have been talking about. 
  The Interior Ministry forces are working with the people to 
fight the big battle against crime. That was also a dangerous 
trend that was making progress. Now we are seeing changes in 
this area. Lack of discipline is another dangerous trend we must 
reverse. Discouragement and doubt are two dangerous feelings 
that must be changed. We must win this battle with ideas. We 
must win this battle with the ideas of socialism, with the ideas 
of our socialism. Someone said that our socialism is ours. We 
could also say, as Marti said about wine: This wine may be sour, 
but it is our wine. If we want to be a bit hard on ourselves we 
could say: Our socialism is ours, but it is inefficient. I am 
not going to say that we are inefficient in all we do, but we 
have not been able to be efficient in everything, and we are 
inefficient in many ways. We cannot say that we have stopped 
copying. We have copied some things from socialist experiences. 
The socialist experience had some good points, but we also 
copied some of its bad experiences. That was unavoidable. Even 
though some of us were very allergic to the idea of copying the 
experiences of others, we did. In this case, we copied 
experiences from the Soviet Union, the socialist bloc, the first 
revolution in history. It was the first socialist revolution in 
history -- some say the Mexican Revolution was the first -- 
capable of carrying out great feats that were admired by the 
world, that influenced the world, that contributed to the 
process of liberating the peoples of the world, that resisted 
imperialism for many years, that fought and defeated fascism at 
a tremendous cost in lives and sacrifice. It was only logical 
that this process would influence us. Many of our people went to 
school there. Many of our textbooks came from there. They 
advised us in many areas, and their advice was very important in 
many areas. For example, their advice in organizing our Armed 
Forces was very important. But then one day we realized that 
their ideas were not adequate for a country such as ours. Our 
country was confronting the United States. It was then that we 
drafted and established our doctrines. But they taught us 
military technique. We learned important lessons, but we also 
learned that those experiences could not be the doctrine of a 
small country confronting a colossus like the United States. We 
had to change some things and develop the idea of the war of all 
the people. 
  They influenced us in the field of economics. They provided 
advice in many areas. We knew that in some areas, the technology 
was inefficient. I already explained the idea of trucks. Some of 
their technology was efficient. Their thermoelectric plants are 
efficient; their mechanical equipment, their winches, are 
efficient. In many areas, they provided us with efficient 
technology. They were also isolated for a long time. 
Technologically speaking, they were behind, and we got some of 
that, as I explained earlier in the session. We have been 
influenced. We cannot deny this. We were influenced despite the 
enormous spirit of independence our Revolution and party have 
always had. Despite the strong differences we had with them, we 
were influenced. The most palpable proof of this was during the 
October Crisis. There came a time when we had to tell them: You 
are making serious political mistakes. This was in regard to the 
missiles. Something has been said about this. There came a time 
when we had to tell them: You are making serious military 
mistakes. There came a time when we had to tell them that we 
disagreed with this or that. We never agreed with the way they 
solved the missile problem. That soured our relations with them 
for quite some time. They made a mistake. Only a single phrase 
was missing to turn a mistake into victory. Had they said: We 
are willing to withdraw the missiles if you will guarantee that 
Cuba will get what it wants, we would have asked for a few 
things: that the pirate activities cease, that the economic 
blockade be lifted, and that Guantanamo Base be closed. No one 
in the world would have approved of a war breaking out over a 
naval base in Guantanamo, an economic blockade, or pirate 
actions. 
  We could have stopped the economic blockade and closed 
Guantanamo Base back in 1962, but they did not act and we are 
still facing those problems. A little bit of equanimity on 
their part would have achieved this. The papers still exist. 
Those papers prove the degree of independence and freedom we 
had in our discussions with the Soviets. Despite all this, it 
was impossible for us not to be influenced. 
  I remember back in the days of the Playa Giron incident; 
when 
we were being threatened back then, we printed hundreds of 
thousands of books of a heroic nature. In those books we 
narrated the main feats and prowesses of the Soviet people 
during World War II. This was done to lift the morale of the 
people. We were influenced, but I do believe our revolutionary 
process has been the most fitting revolutionary process. We did 
this despite our enormous dependence. We had to depend on them 
because of the blockade. We needed supplies, raw material, and 
food from the Soviet Union, and we needed their markets. 
However, I reiterate that our socialism is very much ours. Our 
freedom is the greatest a people has ever attained. We were 
constantly being referred to as a Soviet satellite. There is no 
longer a USSR and we continue to exist. This is why I used the 
metaphor: They said we were a satellite when we were really a 
star that shined with our own light. I truly believe that this 
has amazed the world. We dreamed of a better and more perfect 
socialism. 
  To a certain extent, that enormous aid and help we received 
was bad for us. We became spenders and squanderers. We were 
receiving unlimited amounts of fuel. I want you to know that 
for years all we had to do was send a telegram saying that we 
were running out of fuel oil, that the gasoline was not enough, 
that we needed more diesel, and then ships were immediately sent 
with fuel oil, diesel, or gasoline. It reached such a point 
that our fuel consumption, which was 4 million tons in 1960 -- 
that was when the blockade was imposed and we were left without 
fuel -- was approximately 14 million tons 30 years later. We 
were even exporting oil. When we began saving oil, the sugar 
mills were using 500,000 tons to produce crude. Today they do 
not use one ton to produce crude. We exported the surplus of 
oil, and the Soviets approved the export of any surplus of oil 
we had. Let me tell you that there came a time when our oil 
exports became our largest foreign exchange provider. That will 
give you an idea of how much we had as a result of that 
relationship. All that taught us to squander. 
  This country had 89,000 tractors. Everyone went to ball 
games, to outings, to visit a girlfriend, and to parties in 
tractors. We had all the services and tractors. We could have 
built more aqueducts. Today we continue to use a lot of fuel 
because water must be taken to the workers' villages in 
tractors. In other words, we could say that to a certain degree 
that relationship corrupted [pervirtio] us. 
  Today we are truly learning to save. Today we are saving. 
It seems incredible that with such small amounts, relatively 
small amounts of money, our media are operating. This gives you 
an idea how well we have learned to save. 
  It seems incredible that even after losing 78 percent of 
imports due to the U.S. blockade, which makes everything more 
expensive, this country remains organized and functional despite 
all the limitations. The foods that we now have to bring from 
great distances cost much more, and fuel is more expensive. 
Everything is more much more expensive. 
  Now is when we are learning to save. If in the future we 
begin to pick up our economy little by little, someday we may 
have to erect a monument to the special period. One may say that 
we talk about the special period but there are even worse 
problems than the special period in the world. The world has the 
problem of underdevelopment, the Third World, and uneven trade. 
Those are some of the problems of many countries. In other 
words, there are very serious problems to be solved. 
  We have to solve the special period amidst underdevelopment. 
We still have pretty difficult tasks ahead of us. We must 
overcome the special period and develop ourselves. These are our 
two tasks in today's world. When we reach these objectives we 
will triplicate our efficiency, our capacity to use the 
resources efficiently, and our capacity to save. 
  Times will be better once we get through today's poverty and 
need. We will manage our resources much better, which is 
something we are learning with this terrible test we are going 
through. Those times will be indefinitely different from these, 
from abundance and waste to the situation we are facing today. 
  We need to work little by little, gradually, from the point 
we are at right now. If we do everything we should do, we should 
begin to recover little by little. It would be a lie to tell the 
people that under these circumstances and in view of the 
economic blockade.... [pauses] without the economic blockade, 
without the sabotage, without the harassment that constantly 
victimizes us, we could in a shorter period of time -- not 
immediately, as Robaina said -- start overcoming the special 
period. If the business dealings we are making now were not 
sabotaged, things would undoubtedly be much easier. 
  Now, just look at the difference between the things that 
have 
happened in the USSR. The USSR collapsed -- a country that 
produced 630 million tons of oil, 700 billion cubic meters of 
gas, hundreds of millions of tons of coal, with great power 
plants, great hydroelectric plants, great nuclear power plants, 
and a limitless amount of raw material, wood, and minerals. That 
country collapsed. 
  As we explained earlier, we were pleased, all of us were 
pleased with the news we got from the USSR in regard to their 
attempts to perfect socialism. We wanted to see how they went 
about doing it, and what they did. Undoubtedly, some of the 
things they did we did not like in the least, especially when we 
saw that they were beginning to destroy the history of the USSR. 
A country cannot exist without its history. No country has ever 
had a history as heroic as the USSR. They began to destroy their 
history. They began to destroy the party. They began to destroy 
the government. They began to destroy the state. They ended up 
without a party, without a government, without a state, and 
without history. 
  When we saw this process we realized that that was not going 
too well. Today we can clearly see that they did not have a 
clearly defined idea of what they wanted. They began to play 
with all those things and the fact that this country collapsed 
is truly saddening and grievous. It is saddening and grievous in 
a special way to us, and it is saddening and grievous for the 
Third World. It is saddening and grievous for the entire world. 
  Now they do not know what to do. As much as the West wanted 
to have the USSR disintegrate, now that it has happened it is a 
cause of sorts of concerns for the West. There are conflicts in 
all areas, production has dropped extraordinarily, and I ask 
myself if that was necessary. 
  That is why when they talked about socialism and more 
socialism, I also read the book on perestroyka from cover to 
cover. By then it was clear that we could not do some of the 
things they were doing in a series of areas. We carried on with 
our country's spirit of independence and with the experience we 
had obtained. We were very careful. 
  You may remember that when Gorbachev came, I clearly 
explained at an ANPP [National Assembly of People's Government] 
that the conditions were very different and that we did not have 
to do exactly what they were doing, that if they wanted to 
experiment with the individual parcels of land -- I mean 
individual property -- that we did not have to make the same 
experiment because we had 70,000 individual landowners. 
  We knew how the individual parcels, the cooperatives, and 
the 
state farms operated. Instead, we went after a copy or a 
serviceable imitation of all that. Comrades, we must say that 
perestroyka had a striking influence on our country. 
  The world has begun seeing the tragic and serious 
consequences of all those things. You would have to see the 
suffering all this has brought to those peoples. Who knows what 
sufferings will follow because they should have perfected 
socialism, not destroyed it. 
  Gorbachev never spoke of destroying the Soviet Union or of 
destroying socialism. He always spoke of improving and 
perfecting it and the other socialisms. Who could oppose such 
propositions? Hard and terrible events followed and all this had 
consequences for our country. What fault do we have in all this? 
That that country, which had such solid commitments in all 
areas, would cease to exist is something that seemed incredible 
but that should be and has been a lesson to us. 
  It should be a lesson for the doubts, vacillations, and 
confusion of people discussing whether capitalism or socialism 
is better. We must stress that while under the capitalist 
system, this country never attained what it has attained through 
socialism. We would probably be another Haiti, with 11 or 12 
million inhabitants. Population growth in this country was 
reduced when jobs were created and people were educated. We 
would probably have some 13 or 14 million inhabitants. Oil at 
today's prices. [sentence as heard] That was the kind of future 
we had to look forward to. No one got permission to enter the 
United States. The Revolution opened the doors of the United 
States to hundreds of thousands of emigrants. 
  The first emigrants left the country for political reasons, 
and many others left for economic reasons. These were people who 
wanted to go to live in the United States and have a higher 
standard of living. There are hundreds of millions of people 
around the world who want the same. The Mexican-U.S. border is 
crossed by more than 1 million Mexicans, and there is no 
socialist revolution in Mexico. The Mona Passage has been 
crossed by hundreds of thousands of Dominican citizens, and 
there is no socialist revolution there. Long caravans of Haitian 
boats try to get to the United States. There also are many, many 
Colombians, Central Americans, and Latin Americans trying to get 
into the United States. In Europe they are experiencing the same 
situation with the millions of Turks, Yugoslavs, and North 
Africans who want to live in Europe. The North Africans are the 
ones who work the hardest. They have always been chosen to do 
the hard work. 
  Without revolution, there would have been no immigration; 
without revolution, that privilege granted solely to the Cubans 
would not have been possible. No citizen of any other country in 
the world can enter the United States illegally and ask for 
residency. In its hateful war against Cuba, the United States 
decided that all Cubans who arrived in the country claiming to 
be political refugees and saying they wanted to stay would be 
authorized to remain in the country. No citizen of any other 
country has that right. 
  Only recently, a ship full of Chinese citizens tried to dock 
in the United States. The U.S. authorities were alarmed and went 
crazy doing all they could to send the Chinese citizens back. 
However, all of you know that any lumpen or common criminal, who 
in any other case would not be authorized legal entry to the 
United States, is automatically admitted to the country once he 
gets there in a boat, raft, stolen boat, plane, or whatever. The 
United States openly encourages this. The United States does not 
hide that it encourages illegal departures from this country. 
These illegal departures result in the deaths of many people. 
The United States does not care if children, women, old people 
die in the attempt to get to the United States. All they are 
interested in is publicity, the publicity they create by using 
the people who reach the United States under those conditions. 
The number of illegal departures has increased since the 
country's economic situation has become more difficult. 
  Without the revolution or socialism, this country would not 
have been anything. It would be like the rest of the Central 
American, Caribbean, and Latin American countries. It would not 
even be able to dream about the levels of universal education, 
health care, culture, recreation, sports, employment, social 
secutity brought about by the revolution. What would Cuba be 
like with capitalism? I think it would be the world's greatest 
brothel, the world's greatest casino or gambling hole. That is 
what Cuba would be. For many years they had carried out a work 
of perversion, deformation, and corruption of our country 
through all available means. We would never have been able to 
see the examples of dedication, heroism, virtue, and morale that 
we see today under such difficult conditions. 
  The revolution came to consolidate the independence of the 
nation. Today the revolution and the people have to defend that 
independence, because that is the independence for which Cubans 
have been fighting for 150 years. We escaped from becoming a 
U.S. colony. We escpaed from becoming a Miami. We escaped from 
becoming a Puerto Rico. Today we must defend all this. 
  In that struggle, I believe it is not necessary to remind 
you 
of the importance of your work. 
  Let us look at other experiences that are already better 
known to all of us. The Chinese experience, for example. The 
Chinese people have made many reforms, but they established four 
principles. Look at the difference between the policy followed 
by the Chinese and Soviets. The Chinese established four basic 
principles. One can understand this better every day. First, to 
persist in socialism; second, to maintain the role of the party; 
third, what they call the people's democratic dictatorship -- in 
other words, the government of the workers, the government of 
the revolutionary people, they call it just that: people's 
democratic dictatorship; fourth, support themselves on the ideas 
of Marx, Lenin, and Mao Zedong. 
  Just look at their wisdom. Despite the serious mistakes Mao 
Zedong made....[pauses] it would be objective to say that he 
made mistakes during the Great Leap Forward. He also made 
mistakes during the Cultural Revolution. Despite many of these 
Chinese leaders having suffered the consequences of the Cultural 
Revolution, they preserved Mao Zedong's figure and ideas. They 
criticized the mistakes that were made. 
  They rectified the mistakes but they did not destroy Mao 
Zedong's stature: his history, the Long March, the great merits 
he earned in the fight against Japan and in the fight for 
liberation. They preserved his stature. In other words, they 
preserved the idea of socialism; they preserved the party and 
its role; they preserved the ideas of Marx, Lenin, and Mao 
Zedong; and they preserved their history, all of which is 
contrary to what the Soviets did. 
  They understood that this gigantic country of approximately 
1.2 billion inhabitants -- its approximately population -- could 
not be led and developed if they destroyed these four pillars. 
That is why the Chinese people have achieved considerable 
progress with their reforms, because they made those reforms in 
an orderly manner. There it is really difficult, because there 
are 100 million hectares of cultivable land to feed more than 1 
billion Chinese people. I believe the Vietnamese, who maintain 
similar principles, are also making important progress. 
  We have had a great deal of contact with the Vietnamese and 
the Chinese. We analyze all experiences. That does not mean we 
are going to start copying what the Vietnamese and the Chinese 
are doing. They are the first to counsel their friends not to 
copy. If we study the experience acquired in those countries, it 
could be useful. It is clear that the conditions are very 
different. In Cuba, 80 percent of the population is located in 
the cities. All agriculture is mechanized. 
  In China, 75 percent of the population -- 800 million 
peasants -- live in rural areas. They even made some 
agricultural reforms. They gave very small portions of land to 
the peasants. Chinese peasants plant the rice plant by plant. 
They obtain two harvests. They have enough time, because they 
plant in seedbeds before the actual planting. By doing this, 
they are ahead by one month. By doing this, they obtain two 
harvests on insignificant amounts of land. 
  We cannot do this. In Sancti Spiritus, for example, we have 
a 
rice crop of 30,000 hectares. The maximum a single Chinese 
family has been given is a quarter of a hectare. Many have even 
less than a quarter of a hectare. If we were to give 1 hectare 
to each family, we would need 30,000 families, whereas today, 
1,500 workers labor with the aid of machinery. If we were to 
give what the Chinese give their peasants, we would need 120,000 
families. Do you think that in the republic, we could find 
120,000 families to give a quarter of a hectare to? [Chuckles] 
You will not find them. This became an irreversible reality when 
80 percent of the population became urbanized. The Vietnamese 
are like the Chinese. They have 80 percent of the population in 
rural areas. 
  In other words, there are some measures that we cannot take. 
We can create the UBPC, which correspond to population 
distribution. They have done many things and have given us some 
advice. Regarding the problem of excess currency, the Vietnamese 
warned us against certain mistakes they made. They have 
reiterated this to us, and have said: Be careful. Do not make 
certain mistakes we have made. Of course we must point out that 
the Vietnamese people have had a very friendly attitude toward 
us. China's attitude toward us has been very friendly. It was an 
honor to Cuba that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's first 
official visit was to Cuba. 
  Contacts have been extremely useful because through them we 
have obtained a clear idea of what they are doing and how. 
Through those types of contacts and through visits with 
delegations from that country, we have been able to acquire a 
broad idea of what they are doing. 
  I must say that this man is one of the most interesting 
personalities to visit Cuba. He is an educated, capable, 
communicative man. He knows several languages. He had to study 
English while a young student at the pre-university level. He 
had to study Japanese when the city he grew up in came under 
Japanese occupation. He later had the opportunity to study 
Romanian and Russian, besides knowing Chinese, which is probably 
his greatest merit. [chuckles] He knows the language of Shanghai 
and the language of Beijing. As many of you know, all the 
Chinese languages use the same signs, but the pronunciation is 
different. He is truly a very intelligent man. 
  Text] The best impression that we have.... [rephrases] The 
most satisfactory thing that we have seen in those contacts is 
their unquestionable will to build socialism and to carry forth 
the development of socialism, and the defense of socialism. 
  Of course, they have made a great number of reforms. The 
Vietnamese people have made changes more recently, and the 
Chinese for some time now, but they have done so with great 
wisdom and caution. Consider that they have made a series of new 
reforms. They are applying new methods that [words indistinct] 
but I have reached the conclusion that this gigantic country 
cannot develop, progress, and solve the historic problems it 
has....[changes thought] Keep in mind that in 25 years its 
population will be 1.5 billion. Each year its population grows 
two times Cuba's population. They have been able to clothe, 
feed, and improve the living conditions of 1.18 billion people. 
  I have reached the most absolute conviction that without 
socialism, which was precisely what gave them the victory over 
feudalism and foreign occupation, and without the basic ideas of 
the [word indistinct], the party, and its history this country 
could not exist or develop itself. I have reached that 
conclusion, and they are obtaining great success. It is one of 
the fastest developing countries in the world at the moment. The 
Vietnamese are also progressing. 
  For us this is excellent news because we see socialism 
consolidating itself in a country of more than 1.2 billion 
people and in another country of great history and of great 
heroism where more than 80 million people live. There are 
approximately 1.3 billion people living under socialism; that is 
why no one can talk about the end of socialism. Of course, they 
cannot treat China like they treat Cuba. Not even Vietnam. They 
live farther away. China does not suffer a blockade. The empire 
is softening the conditions with Vietnam. They are already 
allowing U.S. business offices in that country. They cannot take 
the risk of losing such a gigantic market as that one, 
especially a country that grows like Vietnam. 
  That is not Cuba's situation. For us everything is much more 
difficult. But we must be capable of working and struggling 
under such difficult conditions. 
  Lage [Politburo member Carlos Lage] explained how we are 
prioritizing a series of activities. He explained how the 
tourism investments are progressing. I must say that just 
yesterday.... [Changes thought] A few days ago, when we 
inaugurated the hotel in Cayo Coco, a joint venture agreement 
was signed to build 3,000 houses; this is in addition to another 
3,000 houses that we had previously agreed on for the same 
place. They are agreements to build 6,000 apartments, not 
houses, in that key which was previously isolated and 
inaccessible. Today a beautiful road connects those keys. The 
first hotel that was built is ours, and it was built with our 
own capital. 
  Yesterday we signed an agreement for investments in another 
place for $600 million. It also is in one of those places that 
we exploited by building up the embankments. In other words, 
these investments are maturing despite the imperialist 
resistance, despite the sabotage; investments that are not here 
in the capital are maturing. If there is one place where we 
would like to have a minimum of tourism, that place is here in 
the capital. We must develop our natural resources. 
  The oil situation is very difficult. It is our Achilles' 
heel. If we solve....[rephrases] When we solve the fuel 
situation, we will have the main problem solved. Today we have 
to save fuel in every activity and make the power plants 
contribute to the national network, conserving energy wherever 
possible. And there is still potential for more energy 
conservation. 
  We must say that lately the main effort has been silently 
directed toward finding oil. We have reached 1.1 million [unit 
not specified]. We have needed modern technology. We have 
created partnerships that allow us to extract twice the amount 
of oil we had been extracting from many deposits and using 
different techniques. It is true that that oil is thick, it 
corrodes the boilers in a certain way, and that producing cement 
and electricity with it requires a greater maintenance of those 
installations, but we have the hope of finding light oil. 
  Of course, in virtue of the steps that we have taken, today 
we use the most modern techniques and methods. Today we are 
working with the most modern equipment for oil exploration. In 
other words, we are working very hard on the oil problem. 
  [Text] We also have been working hard in other areas such 
as the pharmaceutical and the biotechnological industries. Today 
it is an area that no longer requires too many investments. We 
have truly created an industry. Today the battle lies in finding 
markets despite the competition of multinational corporations. 
Despite this competition, I can assure you that we are 
advancing. Despite all the obstacles, we are advancing in those 
areas. 
  All the other programs are being developed in extremely 
difficult conditions. The food program has faced fertilizer, 
pesticide, fuel, and animal feed shortages. In other words, the 
food program has truly been a difficult task because of the 
conditions it has been carried out in. The construction of 
housing is beginning to pick up with the construction of low 
cost housing. There is a strong movement to solve this situation 
in all the provinces thorugh these means. There are many other 
transactions and businesses that are being created. 
  Consider the decrease suffered by the sugar harvest this 
year. From 7 million it dropped to 4.2 million metric tons. As 
Lage explained, it was 1.7 million metric tons short of the 
goal. It has deprived the country of close to $400 million. The 
low nickel prices also deprived us of many more millions of 
dollars. As he said, the low prices of the seafood exports 
because of monetary fluctuations also cost us many millions of 
dollars. 
  I want you to know that it has been a true heroic deed to 
have supported 1993. You cannot imagine how great. You cannot 
imagine the work and effort that was necessary, the solutions, 
and how these solutions were sought for the next sugar harvest. 
The next harvest will not be much greater, but [word indistinct] 
a little better. 
  Now we are working on the recovery of the sugar industry. We 
have established good agreements in the citrus industry; we have 
saved the citrus plantations; we have established commercial 
associations in the citrus industry; and the same goes for many 
other activities. 
  I believe everybody is looking for something, but one must 
look in an orderly manner. Maybe one of the negative tendencies 
that is being developed is that everybody wants to set up a 
small shop. Everybody wants to get some foreign currency, and in 
whatever manner they can. That must be done in an orderly 
manner. Everybody wants to set up a store. That must be done in 
an orderly manner. 
  It is true that when the depenalization was established for 
[foreign currency] the prices at the stores that supplied 
tourists and diplomats were low. That network of stores had to 
be used. Logically, prices were increased. Why? Because if 
someone has the privilege of buying something that others cannot 
buy, it is fair that something be left for the benefit of those 
who do not have the possibility of purchasing in a foreign 
currency store. Therefore, that policy was applied. Sales 
increased. Sales continue to increase and all that is being 
regulated. 
  These transactions should make up a pretty important source 
of income, but with a cetain risk. I am not talking about the 
(Barbarita)- type transactions, because there is a mechanism so 
that everybody can consult, analyze, and approve or disapprove 
the suggestions made. What we cannot allow are free markets. But 
there is a strong tendency. There is a strong tendency of 
indiscipline. There are strong tendencies toward a free market, 
even within the state organizations and institutions. We must do 
this with great order; if not, everyone begins to horde and 
waste money. Therefore discipline is necessary. These types of 
transactions need to be analyzed and approved. No one should 
make inventions freely since there are mechanisms they can 
consult and get a prompt response. 
  Even the idea for JUVENTUD REBELDE's small business, the 
printing of their small newspaper for the tourists-- it was 
submitted and then rapidly approved. Not a single minute was 
lost. We already know what is going to be done with those funds. 
That is why in the Central Committee meeting we made a strong 
call for discipline. Because even ministers could get involved 
in this indiscipline, and when you realize it, they are 
inventing something. 
  We have said clearly and flatly that the established 
procedures for each one of these things will be rigorously 
applied. If rumors arise, as it was demonstrated here today, it 
is because someone is thinking about something. A minister comes 
up with an idea, he organizes a commission and begins to analyze 
it, and from that commission all kinds stories begin to emerge. 
It has even been established that to create a commission and 
analyze something, the idea must first be submitted. 
  We have already heard the (Cuyo) story; Felipe finally gave 
us the entire version. How does its go, Felipe? It is better 
that you tell us. He says he might lose his hair stylist. Tell 
it to us clearly, the way you told it before. 
  [Felipe] The hair stylist heard it while she was waiting in 
line from a woman who had heard it from her neighbor whose 
husband was working in this and knew all about these things. 
  [Castro] [Chuckles] Alarcon, have you assigned someone to 
look into these transactions -- the transactions with excess 
currency? Some people organize something and then all kinds of 
stories emerge. 
  Today it is very difficult to keep a secret here. It is very 
difficult. [chuckles] We must do what we can, because it is fair 
to say that journalists cannot be considered the only indiscreet 
individuals, that is if they are accused of being indiscreet. 
Today we must be careful with everything. Above all, we must be 
careful, considering the enemy's espionage. In other words, many 
times we (?say things unofficially), but we must be careful. As 
I explained during the congress, we know of many of the 
activities that the CIA of the United States carries out. They 
work very actively. I can assure you that they have no scruples 
of any kind -- in plain language. I can assure you that the 
dirtiest and most cynical ideas are manipulated and dealt with 
as if they were the most natural thing in the world. 
  The U.S. policy's cynicism has just been proven with the 200 
nuclear tests that they carried out secretly. While they want to 
take North Korea's eyes out, because they say the Koreans have 
research centers that could allow them to build nuclear weapons, 
and they threaten them even with war, they carried out 200 
secret nuclear tests. Just look at the adversary we have. Just 
look at what an adversary. Their intelligence services work very 
hard against us. That is why discretion should be a principle in 
many activities, at least so they do not blame us.[as heard] 
  There are things that we can keep secret, and we do keep 
them 
secret. Historically, we have proven that we can keep difficult 
things secret. The whole process of the installation of 
strategic missiles was a secret known to millions of Cubans, yet 
the CIA did not know about it. [chuckles] They found out about 
it when they sent their planes. As we have said before, it was a 
mistake by the Soviets. After they installed the surface to air 
missiles, they allowed the U-2 planes to fly over. That was the 
mistake we made on that occasion. 
  We can maintain some secrets, but today everything is 
difficult, because there is more disloyalty and weakness. It is 
easier for them to penetrate; it is easier for them to buy 
people; it is easier for them to carry out their espionage 
activities, and all of this makes our work a lot more difficult. 
But we continue to work. If we resist we will win. 
  Just look at some recent examples so you can see that it is 
not easy to govern the world. We have a superpower which has 
established a unipolar world, but that world is a very difficult 
world to govern. Just look, it is very difficult to govern. They 
want to govern the world, but the world is almost impossible to 
govern. Look at what happened in Somalia-- what seemed like a 
field trip, an invasion with tens of thousands of soldiers to 
bring food. They have already killed more than 10,000 Somalis: 
men, women and children. Just look at the methods that this new 
world order uses to help the rest of the world. 
  They found resistance. It is incredible that this people, 
with the terrible lack of necessities they suffer and despite 
their lack of unity, were capable of resisting. That resistance 
caused the U.S. Government to make decisions with regard to 
their policy in that country. We must recognize that this 
government had the courage to rectify and understand that they 
had entered a dead end and decided to withdrawal its troops in a 
specific time period. 
  In Bosnia-Hercegovina, where some time ago the United States 
was a party to the idea of offering troops, today just about no 
one wants to be there. The world has problems and it will have 
even greater problems, and it will become ungovernable for them. 
  Now, just compare our people's resistance power with another 
country's capability to resist a military aggression. What other 
country can be better prepared than us with the doctrine of the 
correct defense? None. Because you cannot say that Iraq had a 
correct doctrine of defense. It was the idea of conventional 
war, while we have the idea of the people's war. In other words, 
despite the special period, the country not only has been able 
to maintain its defense capability, it has been able to increase 
its capability. Even though we no longer receive the resources 
that used to arrive here continuously, we have even been able to 
strengthen the defense of our country, with much fewer costs. 
  That is why it is so important to resist. To resist not 
only do we have to make the superhuman efforts that we have been 
making in many fields, but we must make a superhuman effort in 
the political field. It must be done by the party, by the mass 
organizations, and by the Union of Young Communists. That effort 
must be made by you. We count on you. 
  I have the strongest conviction that we will be able to 
overcome any difficulty or problem and that we will cooperate 
with you in optimizing the work of the media. What we need to do 
is to preserve the work of the media. That is why I wanted to 
talk to you a little on this. We will do the impossible. 
Robertico [Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina] said we have done 
everything possible and we are doing the impossible. 
  We will not work miracles later, we are already working 
miracles to make sure our media have paper, our radio has its 
nuts and electronic components or transistors, and our 
television and our technicians have video tapes [audience 
laughs] and anything else they need. Since the technology has 
been changing, we have been left behind [chuckles]. There are 
gifts that can ruin you. Others were given these things, but we 
do not have that problem. 
  I believe if we go forward with our plans we will be able to 
solve the problems. Today there is a greater understanding by 
the population. Before it was much more difficult. Today the 
people know that we take measures not because want to, but out 
of necessity. 
  All these measures also have a negative effect. They have an 
effect that weakens the people. It has a certain corrupt effect. 
But we must know how to be virtuous on the streets, not virtuous 
in an ivory tower, as we have said on other occasions. We must 
know how to be pure and virtuous in the midst of all these 
problems. 
  Therefore, our battle is much more difficult. Nevertheless, 
we are sure, as you are, that we will win [applause] with this 
magnificent contingent of journalists, all of us united and in 
cooperation one with another, as we have said here. 
  That is another dimension that has emerged: integration, the 
combination of the press and the radio. All this will multiply 
our resources. All this will multiply our forces. All this will 
allow us to take advantage of the talent that we have available. 
We will not have an excess of journalists. The work we have 
ahead of us is so great that we will need all of them. I do not 
know how the situation of those given amnesty [amnistiados] will 
end up. I hope [chuckles] you have the means or the opportunity 
to win their hearts. It may be very difficult. There are people 
who cannot be won. Our duty is to win all who can be won without 
being tolerant of a lack of principles, of blackmail, and those 
things that demoralize our people. 
  That is why I believe that in the end the decision is 
correct. No one can say there is no generosity. If there are 
doubts, we can expound on them. If they can be corrected, we 
must set only one condition: that they be the best. We will not 
settle for them simply returning to the family of journalists; 
they must be among the best, and not among the ranks of the 
journalists. This is a problem you will solve. 
  I have already spoken a lot, but I believe I will say what 
all our comrades are feeling. This has been a magnificent final 
session of the UPEC Congress, and we leave here feeling happy. 
We marvel at this magnificent meeting that we have had with you. 
Thank you very much. I am not going to say socialism or death, 
because it is assumed [crowd chuckles] [applause], nor am I 
going to say fatherland or death, because it is also assumed. 
[applause]

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Alverta Avila] </F>
  [Text] Political parties such as the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI], the National Action Party [PAN], and 
the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] have condemned the 
violent incidents in Chiapas. 
  The opposition is asking that these events not to be used as 
a pretext for unleashing a witch hunt or persecution campaign or 
for prolonging political uncertainty. 
  The political parties agree that the armed uprising in some 
Chiapas municipalities is a desperate reaction to a situation of 
severe dissatisfaction by the Indian communities, which have 
subjected to discrimination, poverty, and plunder for several 
decades. 
  PRI, PAN, and PRD leaders made and urgent call to the 
government not to attempt a military solution for what is an 
economic and social conflict. 
  Rene Bejarano, PRD president in Mexico City, said that a 
massacre in Chiapas must be avoided at all costs and that the 
events must not be used to initiate a witch hunt or persecution 
campaign or to create more political uncertainty. 
  [Begin Bejarano recording] Because in-depth political 
reforms were postponed for the sake of alleged economic reforms, 
the chain broke at its weakest link. In that respect, to carry 
out a military incursion without seeking a negotiated solution 
would only cause a massacre. [end recording] 
  At the same time, Cecilia Romero, PAN assistant secretary 
general, did not reject the possibility that there could be a 
political group or party with their own specific interests 
behind the Zapata National Liberation Army [EZLN]. The PAN 
leader demanded a decisive position from the government to 
prevent the problem from spreading and to deter other political 
forces from manipulating the incidents for their own benefit as 
social peace is at risk. 
  [Begin Romero recording] This could lead to some type of 
election manipulation [words indistinct] at this time. On the 
other hand, the concerns expressed are understandable, but it 
would be very serious for us to fall into sensationalism. I 
believe this situation will be controlled. [Interior Secretary] 
Mr. Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido must know quite well what is 
happening since he was Chiapas governor at one time. I believe 
he is still Chiapas governor on special leave. [end recording] 
  PRI Leader Demetrio Sodi criticized the fact that reports 
disclosed last May related to the presence of guerrilla groups 
in Chiapas had been disregarded. Sodi indicated that instead 
of assigning blame, it is necessary to find out what really took 
place and why the conflict reached such dimensions. 
  [Begin Sodi recording] ... blame someone, we would first 
have to find out what really happened. In other words, if we 
recall that last May several newspaper reports and interviews 
indicated that a guerrilla movement was rising in the region. 
Our contacts with social groups revealed that there were groups 
obtaining weapons and preparing a spectacular political blow 
such as what took place yesterday. [end recording]

CLARIN] 
  [Text] Following the uprising in Santiago del Estero, 
which President Carlos Menem labelled "sedition," the government 
is assessing the means available to repress possible protests in 
other provinces and has started to disburse advance payments and 
other emergency measures to relieve social pressure, at least 
during the summer season. 
  A secret report on provincial police forces' "operation 
capability," to which CLARIN had access, describes in detail the 
situation in eight other provinces with information predicting 
problems ranging from potential disobedience or self-confinement 
to barracks to the lack of equipment to repress revolts. 
  When CLARIN consulted Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf as a 
result of this report, he admitted that the situation in the 
provinces is "worrisome." However, Ruckauf immediately 
explained that the "uprisings" took place "not where adjustments 
were made but rather where they were not made, where there is no 
political leadership and there is corruption." 
  On 23 December Ruckauf proposed during a cabinet meeting 
holding a meeting of all governors in Mar del Plata on 21-22 
January. That same morning a large number of governors paraded 
through Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's office to ask for 
financial aid. 
  Not everyone got what he expected, although the finance 
minister did disburse a certain amount of funds. In the case of 
Jujuy, Salta, Catamarca, and La Rioja, the Finance Ministry 
advanced federal revenues apportioned for provinces to pay 
salaries and Christmas bonuses. These advances will be renewed 
in the following months "until we can find a mechanism to settle 
accounts," according to a government official. 
  During the meeting, Ruckauf and Cavallo both admitted the 
need to create alternate job opportunities to absorb the 
employees who have to leave the public administration. Ruckauf 
referred to the "unfair distribution" referring to the sky-high 
salaries of upper-level officials compared to the meager minimum 
salaries of the lowest echelons. He believes, however, that 
they can succeed if they "engage in a transformation process." 
  Corrientes, for example, obtained a 45 million [no currency 
specified] credit and Chaco, 18 million. Brand-new Corrientes 
Governor Raul Romero Feris, during his recent visit to Buenos 
Aires, depicted an explosive situation that -- he warned -- 
could only be attributed to three federal government 
interventions before he became governor. Rolando Tauguinas, in 
a visit previous to the one paid on 3 October, warned Menem that 
the protests and unrest were unrestrainable. The provincial 
government officials were booed during ceremonies in the 
outskirts of Resistencia. 
  In La Rioja, the president's home province, the revolt only 
ended when the salary adjustment law was derogated, the transfer 
of special funds was confirmed, and former Labor Minister Jorge 
Rodriguez was sent to the province to reach an agreement with 
the labor unions, shortly before resigning over a disagreement 
with the government's social policies. 
  As for safety, 20 days earlier in San Juan the government 
had 
summoned all provincial ministers. The demands were jotted down 
by Hugo Franco, interior ministry security under secretary. 
Social unrest then broke out in Santiago del Estero. Protests 
and the occupation of city halls shook Jujuy, Salta, Tucuman, 
and Formosa. 
  As a result, the government deployed 1,452 border policemen, 
a number that dropped shortly before Christmas Eve to 532, 
considered the number necessary to squash any possible crisis, 
while the force as a whole remains "on alert." 
  According to the SIDE's [Secretariat for State 
Intelligence] "strictly secret and confidential" report, the 
situation in each province is as follows: 
  Catamarca: It has 1,800 men but "not very modern logistical 
equipment," although it has patrol vehicles and sophisticated 
radio equipment that allows it to cover a "vast area of its 
territory." According to the report, Catamarca police "fully 
respond to the political power; therefore, it is estimated that 
they will respond promptly and efficiently in the case of a 
revolt." 
  Corrientes: The number of policemen in this province is 
enough "to efficiently control situations arising from 
demonstrations," and it is pointed out that there are no signs 
of salary or disciplinary problems arising here. However, 
according to the report, "the force's operating capacity may be 
weakened by the need to face a lengthy action as a result of an 
insufficient amount of dissuasive defense and safety equipment 
(rubber bullets, tear gas bombs, shields, gas masks)." 
  Chaco: The report, in referring to the province that 
worries the government most due to its socio-economic situation, 
says: "The available means and elements would be insufficient 
to control significant demonstrations of unrest as well as to 
endure a lengthy action." It is believed, however, that the 
aforementioned deficiencies may be "overcome" by the 
professionalism of its forces. 
  Jujuy: This province has sufficient men and equipment "to 
control cases of unrest." The government, however, is not 
certain whether police would be willing to carry our repression 
actions. "In the beginning the policemen would obey the orders 
received, but it is not quite clear how they would react if they 
found themselves in a tight spot after receiving the order to 
repress." The explanation is the feeling of unrest within the 
police due to the possibility that the provincial minister of 
government will appoint a retired policeman as head of the 
police force. Therefore, after receiving the order to repress, 
"the policemen may try to ratify the orders received and, to the 
contrary, may act with indifference to the possible revolt." 
  La Rioja: Police have two "anti-riot" squads with a total of 
18 men "with poor professional training." It also has been 
reported that the useful life of tear gas grenades and rifles is 
"over," and "demonstrators can throw them back because of their 
delayed operation." 
  The report on troop morale is not any better. "Police forces 
do not respect the chain of command, and neither hierarchy nor 
rank are observed." Even though troops are expected to "obey" 
orders, "if a situation becomes ungovernable, they will confine 
themselves to barracks or adopt a passive attitude." The 
government has sent 120 border policemen to this province in 
order to preserve tranquillity. 
  Salta: In this province, where a town hall building has been 
occupied in the north, there are means and men, and "the troops 
will obey the orders" in case of excesses. 
  Santiago del Estero: "Logistics support is insufficient," 
although there are modern automotive units. There are 4,500 men 
(one of the larger units), but -- the report says -- "on 16 
December they were thoroughly overwhelmed by demonstrators." 
Officials, however, say in a low voice that the police actually 
decided not to intervene. 
  Tucuman: "The province's 5,000 troops are properly outfitted 
with an appropriate supply of tear gas, anti-riot shields, smoke 
grenades, rubber bullets, etc." The strongest concern here 
centers around "the lack of hierarchical authority, while there 
is some displeasure within the police in light of the command's 
lack of leadership capacity," the report says, mentioning the 
case of Mario "Malevo" Ferreyra. It is believed, however, that 
"in case of a social outburst, the troops will obey government 
orders."

  [Text] Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo will step up his 
offensive against the rebel provinces that refuse to join the 
Fiscal Pact sponsored by the government. Cavallo has said that 
those provinces which do not join the pact will lose investments 
and employment compared to those that join the pact. The 
minister issued a memorandum that will be released tomorrow at 
the cabinet meeting in which he states that whatever happens in 
the rebel provinces "will be their responsibility." His 
offensive takes place amid increasing complaints from state 
unions in the interior. Yesterday President Menem called the UCR 
[Radical Civic Union] "demagogic" because of its criticism of 
the economic plan. 
  The provinces that do not join the pact will have no 
investments, will not create new employment opportunities, but 
will on the contrary see current employment vanish because of 
the higher costs in the productive area compared to their sister 
provinces that join that commitment. 
  This is the idea that Domingo Cavallo wants to push through 
tomorrow at the national cabinet meeting. The minister intends 
to increase the pressure on the indolent provinces (the main one 
being Cordoba, the minister's birthplace, where all negotiations 
to include it have failed). 
  The minister issued a memorandum, to which CLARIN had 
access, 
which he intends to distribute tomorrow among his counterparts. 
In it Cavallo stresses the importance of the transfer to the 
provinces of the heavy decisionmaking powers concerning the 
economic policy. The pact authorizes the provincial governments 
to make decisions of strategic economic nature. 
  The idea of the economic team is clear: "What happens in the 
provinces that do not sign the pact will be the responsibility 
of the provincial governments," according to an official close 
to the minister's office. 
  Cavallo's offensive is based on the unstable socioeconomic 
situation affecting several provinces. The situation in the 
interior of the country became evident amid violent social 
incidents that took place in Santiago del Estero two weeks ago 
and which included the burning of Government House, the 
Legislative Assembly, and the Court buildings. 
  Starting with that social outbreak, state unions from 
different provinces strengthened their demands against the 
adjustment plans, demands which continue without a solution. 
  Cavallo will propose tomorrow at the cabinet meeting, among 
other things, that relations between the provincial public 
sector and the productive area must be strengthened so that tax 
policy measures may be directly related to the proposed 
objectives. 
  In this manner, the memorandum adds, decisions on provincial 
public policies concerning taxes, infrastructure investments, 
and essential public services such as education, health, 
security, justice or social assistance will have a new framework 
based on production. 
  According to the Finance Ministry theory, 17 provinces and 
the federal capital will be favored in the productive levels 
that represent 28,166,659 inhabitants, while other six 
jurisdictions will see their economic activities hampered and 
their prospects for growth and employment for 4,442,028 people 
tarnished. 
  The document proposes that "tax decisions will no longer 
simply imply the stabilization of public accounts. From now on, 
in the provinces that signed the pact, the provincial 
governments will guide the productive level and will be able to 
use the most adequate instruments to favor those sectors that 
promise to increase the level of employment and production, 
because the measures included in the pact seek to favor 
competition by cutting costs considerably." 
  Last week Cavallo signed a detailed report on the accounts 
situations of all provinces, a document which he intends to use 
should his interpolation in the Chamber of Deputies be confirmed. 
  In that report, which CLARIN published in an exclusive 
manner, Cavallo said the provincial deficits are the result of 
the 3 October electoral promises. 
  The following provinces have not yet signed the fiscal pact: 
Catamarca, Cordoba, and Chubut, while Neuquen, Santa Cruz, and 
Rio Negro have already announced their adherence. 
  But the economy minister's intention to influence private 
businessmen is also clear: "The many businessmen who wish to 
program higher levels of investments will be unable to invest in 
those provinces where tax and labor costs will be considerably 
higher." 
  The minister will discuss further those differences, 
stressing that in the provinces that sign the pact there will be 
reductions in employers contributions on payrolls, which 
currently oscillate between 30 and 80 percent. This reduction 
is tied by the pact to the exemption of tax on gross income, the 
scope of which is between 1 and 1.5 percent.

  [Text] The visit to Argentina that Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari made in October 1992 has accelerated the flow 
of Mexican investments in Argentina, a flow that began to grow 
after the liberalization of the Argentine economy. 
  Before the president's visit, only half a dozen Mexican 
enterprises (banks, among them) had invested in Argentina. 
  Benefiting from the signing of NAFTA, the Mexicans have 
begun 
to conquer markets, among them Argentina. 
  In the Argentine market, Mexican interest has focused on the 
car parts industries, prospecting for and the exploitation of 
oil and gas, textile fibers, farm industry, and cement. 
  Yet as opposed to what happened with European countries and 
with the United States, "rather than speaking about an inflow of 
capital, we should speak about economic supplementation," as 
Mexican Embassy commercial affairs counselor Gonzalo Cervera 
Diaz Lombardo put it. 
  Despite the fact that the balance of trade registers a $61 
million surplus in favor of Argentina, Mexican investment in 
Argentina surpasses Argentine investment in Mexico. 
<H5>  First Investors </H5>
  The Economic Culture Fund [FCE] was the first investor. It 
arrived in Argentina in 1944 to engage in the book publishing 
business. 
  For three years now this enterprise, whose annual sales 
amount to $1.5 million, has published books on economics, 
philosophy, and history -- among other subjects -- on the local 
market. 
  Alejandro Katz, president of the Argentine branch of the 
Fund, said that the enterprise will expand here through a 
network of FCE bookstores. 
  Mexican banks, in turn, arrived in a group. 
  Mexico's strongest banks, the National Bank of Mexico 
(Banamex), Bancomer [Bank of Commerce], the International Bank, 
the National Finance Bank (Nafinsa), and the National Foreign 
Trade Bank of Mexico (Bancomex), installed foreign trade 
offices. They also participate in the capital market, look for 
potential Mexican investors here (and vice versa), and operate 
as a beachhead for other businesses. 
  For example, Banamex purchased 29 percent of Banco del Sud 
shares, paying $23.6 million, and now stands as the majority 
stock owner, with 27 percent of the shares. 
  Nafinsa, 66 percent of which is owned by the Mexican state, 
brought concrete business proposals, as Nafinsa representative 
Elias Rivas Torres put it. The proposals are: 
  -- A Mexican fast food business will begin operating on the 
Argentine market. 
  -- The local firm Massuh and Mexico's Celfimex created an 
industrial waste processing enterprise. The new firm, Mexar, 
called for an initial investment of $800,000. It will be 
located in Quilmes, and expects sales to reach $3 million in the 
first year. 
  In addition, Nafinsa intends to give financial support to 
Argentine firms willing to do business with Mexican firms. 
<H5>  Synthetic Fibers </H5>
  In August 1992, Saul Dessau sold the powerful Synkro Group, 
the manufacturer of Modecraft women's stockings. Synkro is 
engaged in the areas of shoes, cosmetics, and janitorial and 
textile products. With scheduled investments of $10 million, a 
new plant will be built in addition to the plant in Trelew. This 
organization, the world's second largest stocking manufacturer, 
will hit the South American market from Argentina. Dorian Gray, 
Carla Conti, and Paloma Picaso are the women's stockings 
trademarks manufactured by the new enterprise: Arco Plus 
Argentina. 
  The Mexican firm Cellulose and Byproducts bought 37 percent 
of the Argentine enterprise Cordonsed. 
  The Mexicans also participated in the privatization process. 
<H5>  Argentine Partners </H5>
  The Mexican Development Group, in partnership with Benito 
Roggio and a Brazilian organization, has been awarded 
exploitation of the western access highway to Buenos Aires for 
20 years. 
  The partnership, the Western Corridor Group (GCO), will 
invest $160 million to put the highway joining Buenos Aires and 
Lujan in order. According to Orlando Vyeira, international 
director of the Maxican party, they decided to settle here 
because "we see a great future in Argentina." The Mexican group 
is also interested in electric power generation, water supply 
and processing, construction, ports, and airports. 
  Mexpetrol has been awarded the prospecting for, 
exploitation, 
and development of hydrocarbons in El Porton and Buta Ranquil. 
The Mexican firm, whose partners are Astra and YPF [Government 
Oil Deposits], has committed itself to making investments of at 
least $55 million. 
  Enrique Molina is another businessman who is interested in 
Argentina. 
  Molina, who is studying several projects, is enthusiastic 
about the construction of a Ritz Carlton Hotel. He is also 
considering the local sugar market. In the first undertaking 
there is also the possibility of buying a hotel and remodeling 
it. 
  Molina, who owns Mexico's Pepsi Bottling Company, is 
interested in Argentina's San Martin del Tabacal, which produces 
sugar, alcohol, and citrus fruits. 
  Tabacal Vice President Eduardo Patron Costas told LA NACION 
that the Mexican businessman might invest $30 to $50 million in 
the Argentine company, whose annual sales stand at $60 million 
and which is now undergoing a process of restructuring and 
diversification. 
  After a visit to Mexico by its executives two months ago 
Lactona, another company that has been engaging in conversations 
with Mexican entrepreneurs, is negotiating with two Mexican 
firms for the large-scale manufacture of long-life products.

  [Text] It was learned last night at the Defense Ministry 
that both Defense Minister Oscar Camilion and President Carlos 
Menem signed the request for promoting two Navy officers without 
having been informed about some controversial aspects of their 
backgrounds. This situation was denounced by human rights 
organizations. 
  According to a report published by the newspaper PAGINA/12, 
both Navy officers, Captains Antonio Pernias and Juan Carlos 
Rolon, have allegedly been charged with human rights violations 
during the military government. 
  Defense Ministry sources have told LA NACION that there is 
no 
doubt that "someone will have to pay" for this situation, thus 
implying that there were problems with the screening mechanisms, 
which should have duly informed Defense Minister Camilion about 
the delicate issue in question. 
  Defense Ministry sources have said that these promotions 
would not prosper. The same was said in the Senate, which will 
today review several promotions, but not those of Pernias and 
Rolon. 
  When consulted, Navy sources admitted that the Navy is 
experiencing a difficult situation because these two officers 
were handed their respective insignias last week. 
  It has been learned that the names of those up for 
promotions 
were submitted to the Senate with some delay because the Navy 
chief of staff was visiting Germany. 
  In addition, it was learned that the Navy did not consider 
informing the executive branch about some controversial details 
about the officers' backgrounds. 
  Obviously unaware of the situation, Menem yesterday denied 
that his administration had proposed "promotions of such 
magnitude." 
  Navy sources admitted that the promotions of Pernias and 
Rolon were proposed "in compliance with the Constitution" and 
that their records were previously reviewed by the Superior 
Promotions Board.

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Santoro; copyrighted by CLARIN] </F>
  [Text] The Argentine Foreign Ministry and the Foreign 
Office (British Foreign Ministry) on 30 December released a 
joint communique stating that "the British Government authorizes 
fishing" in 1994 in the area known as the outside zone, which is 
located west of the Malvinas islands. The communique opens 
almost 100 percent of the fishing zone that London unilaterally 
imposed in 1986 around the islands. 
  The Argentine-British communique states that the Kelpers 
(the 
islanders) in 1994 may fish only 150,000 tons of squid, both in 
the 150-mile zone around the Malvinas (known as FICZ [expansion 
unknown], which is its English acronym), and in the outside zone 
(FOCZ [expansion unknown]). 
  This figure was agreed upon at the negotiations on 1 
November 
1993 (for Argentina, the maritime limit is 220 miles). Fishing 
and prospecting for oil are two issues intimately linked with 
the conflict over sovereignty over the islands. 
  The communique, which was simultaneously released in London 
and Buenos Aires on 30 December, takes into account the 
so-called sovereignty protection "umbrella" the two countries 
agreed upon in 1990. In its substantive part, the communique 
states: 
  "The Argentine and British Governments today declared that 
in 
line with the previous exchanges between the two governments, 
the British Government will authorize fishing during the 1994 
season in the maritime zone described in the annex to the joint 
declaration of 28 November 1990." 
  The short communique means that Great Britain has agreed to 
issue a joint communique to announce a measure that it was going 
to adopt unilaterally, in order to facilitate the Argentine 
Government's presentation to the nation of its new progress in 
the South Atlantic. 
  The complex diplomatic language, however, reveals that the 
decision to authorize fishing in the zone -- where all types of 
fishing were banned for two years -- was made by London, and 
that it was not a joint decision. 
  It is not merely a matter of semantics. The area that has 
been opened to third-party ships is as big as Rio Negro 
Province. In 1990, then-Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo, 
shortly after the reestablishment of diplomatic relations, 
managed to release a joint communique in which the two countries 
decided to simultaneously ban fishing in the outside zone. 
  But, as CLARIN noted on that occasion, the fact that no 
ships 
with Argentine license are allowed to operate in that zone and 
National Prefecture ships cannot patrol it either shows that 
both joint communiques are a nice envelope for a bitter measure: 
the expansion of the British fishing zone around the Malvinas. 
In this regard, Kelper John Barton -- the Malvinas Fishing 
Department chief -- has clarified things to REDES magazine: "In 
the zone known as FOCZ, fishing will be allowed only with a 
license granted by our government." 
  The only British concession obtained in the last 
negotiations, along with the decision to release a joint 
communique, is to maintain the 150,000-metric ton ceiling for 
the licenses to be granted by the Kelpers. 
  [The same newspaper, on the same date and page, adds: "Vice 
Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella on 30 December said the 
Argentine-British joint communique was `very positive' for a 
series of reasons. 
  ``Petrella told CLARIN: `It is a text that was agreed upon 
by the two countries, and not a unilateral measure. Great 
Britain, which could have adopted a unilateral decision, 
preferred not to do it, thus preserving the level of bilateral 
relations.' 
  ``Petrella, who on 30 December replaced Foreign Minister 
Guido Di Tella, who went on vacation, emphasized that the 
communique `has the same value as a communique' [as published] 
and noted that the fact that it was issued within the framework 
of the sovereignty protection `umbrella maintains the validity 
of the fact that Great Britain admits that it is a disputed 
zone.''']

  [Text] After systematically refusing to sign the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (TNP) for 25 years, Argentina will 
finally do so in 1994. This announcement was made, quite 
unexpectedly, by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. 
  This announcement constitutes a turnabout by the Peronist 
government in yet another traditional stance of Argentina's 
foreign policy, namely the reluctance to sign this treaty 
because it entailed a legal and political "inequality" between 
nuclear countries and nonnuclear ones. 
  During an end-of-the-year toast with journalists, Di Tella 
tried to dampen the effects his announcement will trigger. "In 
our capacity as TNP members we will seek, in 1995, that nuclear 
powers disarm," he said in a matter-of-fact way. He thus 
produced an argument that goes against the historical stance of 
Argentine diplomacy, which had rejected the treaty on the 
grounds it was "the disarmament of those countries that have no 
[nuclear] weapons," according to what was officially reported. 
  Taking stock of the results of the country's foreign policy 
this year, the foreign minister elaborated on "the new security 
policy." 
  "We have implemented a security policy particularly based on 
the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, be they 
nuclear, chemical, or missile," he underscored following an 
aide-memoire that he himself had written to deliver the 
end-of-the-year speech, which nobody expected. 
  He then enumerated some of the measures taken to abandon the 
Foreign Ministry's traditional positions in this area: 
  -- "Our vocation for peace has led us to be totally open 
about the Argentine nuclear program by signing an 
all-encompassing agreement on safeguards with the International 
Atomic Energy Agency and furthering a joint nuclear policy with 
Brazil." Until democracy was reinstated in our country in 1983, 
the United States and other industrial countries suspected that 
our country had a secret nuclear program to develop the atomic 
bomb. 
  -- "We have promoted agreements on the banning of chemical 
weapons, first at the regional level (the so-called Mendoza 
Declaration) and then at international level under the aegis of 
the United Nations." By virtue of the aforementioned 
declaration, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile committed themselves 
to renouncing chemical, bacteriological, or biological weapons. 
It has for time immemorial been surmised that Chile had 
developed chemical weapons in a clandestine way, but it has been 
denied by the current democratic Chilean Government. 
  -- "Furthermore, we proposed amendments to the Tlatelolco 
Treaty together with Brazil and Chile." Congress ratified this 
treaty on 11 November -- after waiting 25 years -- despite the 
Radical Party's opposition. The Tlatelolco Treaty establishes a 
nuclear-free zone in Latin America. The amendments Di Tella 
refers to have to do with the interest Argentina has in 
preserving its industrial secrets, like the method for 
processing enriched uranium developed by the National Commission 
for Atomic Energy (CNEA) at the Pilcaniyeu plant in Neuquen 
Province. 
  -- "We also have discontinued the Condor-2 missile project 
and established the National Commission for Space Activities, 
which is in charge of retrofitting the Falda del Carmen plant 
(where the missile was developed) and developing satellites." 
Following infighting in its own party and a dispute with the 
Radicals, this administration dismantled the missile in 1991 and 
sent its components to the United States this year. It has not 
yet honored its promise to recycle the aforementioned plant into 
a technological research center for peaceful uses. 
<H5>  Contradiction </H5>
  The unexpected announcement by Di Tella on 29 December 
contradicts his own remarks to CLARIN on 8 March 1982, when he 
announced that the government had decided to promote in Congress 
the Tlatelolco Treaty's ratification, but denied the country 
would sign the TNP. 
  Argentina had signed the Tlatelolco Treaty, though its 
ratification by Congress still was pending until November, 
whereas it always refused to sign the TNP. Now the government 
will request signing the agreement and then will have to submit 
it to Congress for ratification so the treaty can take effect. 
What remains to be seen is the UCR's [Radical Civic Union] 
stance on this new and bold step taken by the government.

<F P=106> [Article by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim] </F>
  [Text] When historians and political analysts 
retrospectively study Brazilian-U.S. relations, they are faced 
with a paradox. At the beginning of the 1970's, Brazil was under 
an authoritarian regime, human rights were not respected, 
protectionism was the economic policy touchstone, and countries 
intentionally avoided signing nonproliferation agreements in the 
field of international security. 
  Brazilian-U.S. relations at the time, however, were deemed 
excellent. So much so, that some critics even classified the 
Brazilian international position as "sub-imperialistic." There 
was even a famous sentence uttered by a U.S. president asserting 
that the rest of Latin America would follow whatever trend 
Brazil adopted. Accidentally or not, the sentence caused several 
misunderstandings and was a source of problems for our 
diplomacy. However, it eloquently expressed the U.S. concept 
about the role performed by Brazil and emphasized the good level 
of relations enjoyed by the two countries. 
  Twenty years have elapsed and now Brazil is an entirely 
democratic country, has a free and energetic press, and active 
movements are being staged by civilians. Human rights violations 
-- which frequently are byproducts of social problems -- are 
firmly fought by the government. These issues are dealt with in 
absolute openness. Profound structural reforms translated into 
liberation of the economy and privatizations have replaced old 
protectionist practices. Brazil's firm commitment to disarmament 
and nonproliferation has become the central issue of our foreign 
policy. This was shown by the government's decision to sign 
several international agreements on the peaceful use of nuclear 
energy and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. 
  Despite all these changes, which actually make Brazil 
further 
approach values supported by the United States, one seems to 
strongly perceive that the two countries' bilateral relations 
have become worse. There is a widespread feeling in Brazil that 
Americans see our country more as a "problem" than as an 
important partner that deserves to be trusted. Great emphasis is 
placed on trade conflicts and on certain specific aspects of the 
human rights and environmental issues, although no similar 
measures are adopted by the United States. In the economic 
field, we have received a clear message that all the efforts 
already made are not enough. Instead of concentrating their 
attention on the 90 percent of the results already obtained, 
Americans seem to prefer to point out the remaining 10 percent 
that still must be done. A typical example of this attitude 
refers to the intellectual property issue. 
  Apparently, our achievements in those areas are neither 
understood nor reflected in concrete and positive attitudes. We 
have opened our economy, but we were not granted -- except for a 
token offer -- better access to the U.S. market for our leading 
export products (contrary to one of the key promises made by 
President Bush in his Initiative for the Americas). Despite the 
strengthening of the democratic system in our country and the 
efforts made by the government to come down heavily on those who 
violate human rights, we continue to be the target of 
unprecedented scrutiny and oversimplified criticism by the U.S. 
press and public opinion. Our resolute adherence to 
nonproliferation and disarmament has not facilitated our access 
to advanced technology. 
  Some specific and transient aspects of our situation are 
brought into focus with great interest, but they seem to miss 
the essential aspects. The most significant event in recent 
Brazilian history is the struggle for the consolidation of 
democracy, a process that, under the leadership of President 
Itamar Franco, has been underpinned by a strong moral component. 
The series of events that led to the impeachment voted through 
by Congress in 1992 and the probes into corruption charges that 
Congress currently is conducting are at the very heart of a 
veritable revolution that will have major implications for 
Brazilian political culture. Brazilians are promoting 
all-encompassing structural changes, which at present can only 
be compared with the Clean Hands Operation in Italy. Under the 
influence of public opinion that is becoming increasingly 
involved in our country's affairs, our political system is being 
shaken to its very foundations and will no longer be the same. 
We are in the process of becoming an even more democratic 
society with enhanced social awareness that will be built on 
more solid moral values. The strongholds of impunity, even those 
of the powerful, are already beginning to crumble. 
  Brazil is trying to solve its economic problems in a free, 
democratic, and pluralistic atmosphere. We are confronting our 
problems without resorting to magic or conjuring tricks. We 
reject the authoritarian temptation of having recourse to 
technocratic formulas, which always impose the greatest 
sacrifices on the most vulnerable segments of the population. 
President Itamar Franco and Brazilian society have chosen a 
different path. It may very well be a more complex and exacting 
path, but it can undoubtedly be upheld by a consensual and 
democratic framework. Much of the criticism that one reads or 
hears reveals that these things are poorly understood. 
  There are other aspects that have a significant impact on 
relations between Brazil and the United States. Brazil is 
characterized by a constant trait -- it is a country that has a 
natural leaning toward peace. Its actions in the international 
arena are predictable and trustworthy. These qualities have 
enabled us to maintain harmonious relations with all our 
neighbors in South America for a century. Our vocation for 
fostering nonhegemonic and cooperative relations also is 
projected in other regions, especially Africa. Moreover, our 
country is not torn by any conflicts on account of racial, 
cultural, or religious matters. This is particularly important 
at a time when the resurgence of hatred due to racial 
considerations is putting the lives of so many people of the 
world in jeopardy. We take great pride in these attributes and, 
besides, they obviously represent a contribution to world peace 
and security. Even speaking in terms of economic considerations, 
this unique combination of a peaceful and stable environment 
both domestically and internationally may prove to be a 
"comparative advantage" for likely investors. 
  At a time when the Clinton administration is casting its 
eyes 
over Latin America, it is important to bear in mind that 
cooperation and security in our hemisphere also depend on the 
preservation and enhancement of relations between Brazil and the 
United States, which should be based on mutual trust. Brazil has 
a strategic importance as it is acknowledged to be a pole that 
irradiates values and ideas that have a great impact on several 
parts of the world and are considered in all international 
forums. We deem that democracy is the only system of government 
that makes it possible to have dynamic and creative social 
relations at the domestic level and that may assure the peaceful 
coexistence between peoples at the international level. We deem 
that respect for human rights is a universal law that is not 
subject to particularities of any kind, be them cultural or 
otherwise. Like the United States, Brazil believes in a 
multilateral system of free trade. We contributed greatly to the 
"Uruguay Round," which was recently brought to a successful 
conclusion. Brazil is a global trader [preceding two words in 
English]. The regional initiatives that we further in Latin 
America, and which we consider so important, like the Common 
Market of the South -- Mercosur, the Amazon Initiative, and the 
recently proposed Free Trade Zone for South America, as well as 
our possible future relations with NAFTA, ought to be seen from 
this perspective. Regional integration must strengthen the 
international system of trade rather than being a substitute for 
it. 
  Within the broader framework of the international world 
order 
after the end of the Cold War, Brazil and the United States 
share basic principles and objectives, which have given us 
promising opportunities for cooperation. Our participation in 
the UN Security Council is a good example of this. We are 
witnessing radical changes in the international scene that even 
though they bring a promise of better days, demand mature 
thinking and an exchange of ideas from different perspectives, 
though not necessarily conflicting ones. We should not be afraid 
of dialogue, which is always synonymous with give and take, with 
a mutual learning process rather than blind agreement. 
  Relations between Brazil and the United States have a strong 
economic substratum and a long history. They are marked by great 
convergence and also by some instances of disagreement. This 
dichotomy proves that the possible discrepancies do not override 
our affinity. We must, therefore, harmonize our ideas so as to 
try to better understand each other. The talks I held during my 
recent visit to Washington with Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and security adviser Anthony Lake, and my contacts 
with think tanks [preceding two words in English] that study our 
relations, have led me to believe that Brazil and the United 
States are ready for a mature partnership. A partnership that, 
by bringing the two largest democracies in the hemisphere closer 
together, will be instrumental in turning those values that we 
share into concrete actions that will accrue to the advantage of 
both countries, and indeed the entire hemisphere.

  [Text] The major gold fields in the Amazon region have been 
depleted and for the first time in nearly 20 years, the amount 
of gold produced by mining companies will be greater than that 
tapped by gold prospectors. The director of the National 
Department of Mineral Production (DNPM), Elmer Prata Salomao, 
stated on 12 December in Manaus: "This is a cycle that is 
coming to an end." He reported that the most important gold 
fields in southern Para, northern Mato Grosso, and along the 
Madeira River (AM) [Amazonas] have been exhausted. 
  According to DNPM data, mining companies will produce 40 
metric tons of gold in 1993, whereas gold fields will produce 30 
metric tons. According to Salomao, prospecting for gold in the 
Amazon region has been, for all practical purposes, reduced to 
tapping scrap gold, which is a low-grade ore. 
  Besides exhaustion, gold fields also have come under 
pressure 
from Brazilian society due to environmental considerations. 
This has brought about the temporary deactivation of some of 
them. The expansion of mining companies is a new and positive 
thing. Salomao said gold mining is better organized -- it pays 
taxes, respects workers' rights, and has greater respect for the 
environment. 
  The DNPM also has another reason for being optimistic. 
Smuggling was considerably curbed in 1993 and at present only 
represents 5 percent of the country's gold production. "And 
that percentage constitutes a police case that must be fought," 
stated the DNPM director, who came to Manaus to attend a seminar 
on Gold Prospecting Policies. He exonerated gold prospectors 
from all responsibility for smuggling and explained that it was 
practiced along the Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo axis through the 
dollar black market. He said: "Now everybody is selling his 
gold to the Central Bank, which charges a much lower percentage 
than dealers in dollars." He underscored that industrial 
production of gold in our country is quite insignificant: 
"While Italy's annual production of gold jewelry totals 400 
metric tons, Brazil's production does not even amount to five 
metric tons." Salomao believes the establishment of a jewelry 
factory in our country will be instrumental in exporting some $1 
billion annually and in creating 2 million new jobs.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaime Soares from Sao Paulo] </F>
  [Text] Brazilian industries have had to undergo deep 
structural changes in order to adapt to the crisis and to the 
opening of the market to imported products. The private sector 
has managed to preserve the working capital, has postponed 
investments to increase its operating capacity, and has 
channeled its resources into improving quality and productivity 
so as to be able to live with high inflation rates. 
  According to Price Waterhouse Director Celio Lora, the 
country has the capacity to make investments. The Brazilian 
potential for domestic and loan capital ranges between $120 
million and $150 million, which awaits only some indications 
that the economy has been stabilized, and businessmen's trust. 
<H5>  Financial System </H5>
  Mailson da Nobrega, former [finance] minister and 
consultant, 
is of the opinion that no organized company "would try to enter 
the financial system in order to make a profit." Da Nobrega 
notes that the climate of economic uncertainty has brought about 
the postponement of a considerable number of projects. "And 
liquid companies have decided to wait until things clear up," he 
said. 
  Technological modernization and the reorganization of the 
industrial infrastructure are the main areas in which industrial 
investments are made using domestic capital. Brastemp Director 
Ruy de Campos Filho states that "we are never going to waver on 
whether or not to invest because of the ups and downs of 
inflation, which is an everyday occurrence in our country." 
<H5>  Productivity </H5>
  Brastemp has planned to invest $35 million in 1994. Campos 
Filho reported that those financial resources will be earmarked 
for the replacement of obsolete machinery and for technological 
development. He notes that the company is not contemplating 
increasing its operating capacity. Data provided by Lora 
indicate that productivity has improved over the last year, thus 
confirming the adjustments made by companies in their industrial 
infrastructures. 
  Lora stated that several economic indicators reveal the 
effects caused by optimizing operations. The idle labor force 
level fell from 23 percent in 1992 to 18 percent this year. 
Idle capacity also declined from 32 percent in 1992 to 28 
percent in 1993. 
<H5>  Stocks </H5>
  The vice president of the National Confederation of 
Industries (CNI), Mario Amato, states that "despite everything, 
industries are trying to find a way to survive." In his view, 
"being an entrepreneur is at present a curse." Living with the 
crisis has forced companies to devise new operational mechanisms 
in trying to downsize their structures. "We do not take in new 
employees because we do not know what is in store for us," he 
says. The purchase cycle has been shortened, orders are made 
only "in time of need," and intermediation is on the increase. 
  Angelo Andrea Matarazzo, chairman of the Matarazzo 
Metallurgical Company, believes that the profile of Brazilian 
companies has changed. Their structures have become less 
cumbersome and less expensive; their hierarchical levels have 
been simplified; and they have a greater capacity to quickly 
react to their clients' requests and to maintain strict control 
of their stocks. "My company has been getting ready for this 
for a long time," notes Matarazzo. He states that clients' 
purchasing habits have been changed due to recession. Companies 
are no longer in a position to program orders, and decisions are 
made on a short-term basis. 
<H5>  Competition </H5>
  According to Da Nobrega, agricultural companies, for 
example, 
have developed financing mechanisms to be able to operate 
without the benefits of the government's rural credits. Farmers 
who grow agricultural products for export such as soybeans, 
oranges, and coffee have managed to close deals on the futures 
market for their products, and have adopted innovative measures.

<F P=106> [Article by Gabriel Freire] </F>
  [Text] The "Raul Pellegrin" detachment, an offshoot of the 
Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR), was crippled for all 
practical purposes following the arrest by the Investigations 
branch of its three top leaders, the military, political, and 
logistics chiefs. Seven other persons were also captured in the 
police operation, as well as a sizable arsenal which was 
examined yesterday, 25 November, by prosecutor Humberto Espejo. 
  The persons arrested were identified as Esteban Burgos 
Torrealba, military chief; Alejandro Placencia Urrutia, 
logistics chief; and Ariel Saenz Bont-Martens, political chief. 
Also arrested were a married couple, Luis Emilio Lopez Sandoval 
and Iris Galleguillos Donoso, and Claudia Mella Mateluna, 
Gabriel Venegas Escorza, Leslie Maxwel Narvaez, Jacqueline 
Navarette Mellado, and Paola Orlando Orlando. 
  According to a senior civil police official, the police 
operation was the culmination of extensive intelligence work 
that began last June with the arrest of Jose Saa [sic] Gerbier, 
30 years of age, the top leader of the extremist movement. 
  After obtaining as much information as possible from the 
interrogation of Saa Gerbier, units of Intelligence and of the 
Second Assault Police Station raided four residences on the 
night of 23-24 November, located at Neptuno 101, Pudahuel; Cabo 
de Hornos 0545, Maipu; Pasaje Salitre Peregrino 0882, Puente 
Alto, and Pasaje Corcega 940, La Cisterna. 
  In the first three, the police seized handguns and 
shoulder-fired weapons, and at La Cisterna they captured an 
extensive arsenal that included LAW rocket launchers. 
  Following the arrest of Saa Gerbier, the government 
requested 
a visit by a prosecutor to investigate the subversive 
organization. The prosecutor designated was Magistrate Humberto 
Espejo Zuniga who, after a 10-day period of detention for the 
presumed extremists, conducted a visual inspection yesterday of 
the house at La Cisterna followed by an inspection of the 
captured weapons and explosives at the main offices of 
Investigations. 
  Espejo described the quantity of armaments that the group 
possessed as impressive, when asked about the result of the 
police operations. As to their eventual use, he said that it was 
"evidently for a terrorist plan. We cannot guess what they 
planned to do, but there is no doubt that they were destined for 
terrorist acts." 
  When asked whether documents with specific plans were found, 
he said "no, because these people rarely keep written planning 
records. It must be understood that these are terrorist 
organizations and the chiefs think about what they are going to 
do, at most they will write down some information, an address, 
but they never write down plans." 
  As for crimes that might be attributed to the group, the 
prosecutor said that "approximately 24 high voltage towers have 
been blown up since last year, which is what started this 
investigation. That is for what concerns terrorist acts, but 
there is also a very large number of crimes for gain, about 32 
or 33 crimes, robberies of banks, finance offices, and 
supermarkets. A guard was killed, and there could be some 
connection with the death of a gendarme." (Jose Cortes, on 11 
October, in the motor vehicle section of the Gendarmeria.) 
  He said that this group was an offshoot of the FPMR and that 
"the size of the band" was being investigated, that there was no 
evidence to indicate that this was the group that had freed 
Maritza Jara, on trial for the kidnapping of Cristian Edwards 
del Rio, from San Miguel prison. 
  The "Raul Pellegrin" detachment, which came into being in 
1991 as a result of the breakup of the FPMR, subscribes to the 
thesis of the armed revolution. Its leader uses the name of 
"Commander Rodrigo" in memory of the leader found dead together 
with Cecilia Magni in the mountains of the Seventh Region, 
following the attack on the village of Los Quenes in 1987, in 
which the carabineer Juvenal Vargas was killed. 
<H5>  [Box, p 14] </H5>
<H5>  Arms and Explosives Captured </H5>
  In the residence at Pasaje Salitre Peregrino 0882, Puente 
Alto, the police seized an SHE submachine gun, model P 25, 9 mm 
Parabellum, and two Llama revolvers, Comanche model, .38 caliber 
special. There were also three magazines for the submachine gun 
with a capacity of 40 rounds each, and a large quantity of 
ammunition for the revolvers. 
  In Neptune 101, Pudahuel, police seized a Rossi .38 caliber 
special revolver, a large quantity of ammunition for the weapon, 
and a 50 mm anti-aircraft round. 
  In Cabo de Hornos 0545, Maipu, police found a Spanish 
grenade, a revolver and a CZ pistol, 9 mm short, and ammunition 
for both weapons. There were also two detonators, one with 15 
centimeters of black fuse. 
  Finally, in Corcega 940, La Cisterna, police found an 
extensive arsenal consisting of more than 15 Kg of paint grade 
aluminum powder, used for making homemade bombs; ammonium 
nitrate; potassium chlorite; laminating powder; 300 meters of 
detonating cord at 10 grams per meter, which is also an 
explosive; homemade detonators; a large number of booby traps, 
T4 explosive plastic, electric-type detonators, seven LAW's with 
their rockets, all live or in working order; seven M-16 rifles 
with a large quantity of ammunition, approximately 30 magazines 
with 30 rounds in each one; sawed off shotguns, revolvers, and 
electric detonators. 
  When asked about the destructive power of this arsenal, the 
chief of the Ballistics Department of Investigations said that 
"if we only consider the damage that a LAW rocket can do, we 
have a warlike arsenal able to cause damage of an incalculable 
magnitude. If we add to this the firepower of the M-16's and the 
amount of ammunition seized, we cannot measure the consequences."

  [Text] Havana, 1 Jan (PL) -- Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, the 
vice president of the Council of Ministers, revealed today that 
during President James Carter's administration Cuba and the 
United States held high-level contacts with a view to initiating 
negotiations. 
  The official disclosed these events in an interview with the 
official GRANMA newspaper. He also said that changes in 
relations between the two countries were unlikely during William 
Clinton's administration. 
  Rodriguez said that "a possible solution to the U.S.-Cuba 
crisis" had been interrupted by Carter's decision to accuse Cuba 
of being responsible for the internal conflict in Zaire, which 
was triggered by armed refugee groups on the border with Angola. 
  He recounted that he was scheduled meet secretly with then 
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance at the apartment of Andrew Young, 
then U.S. representative to the United Nations, on the same day 
that hostilities broke out in the African nation. 
  Rodriguez said that Vance was meeting with former USSR 
Foreign Minister Andrey Gromyko when Carter gave the speech in 
which he made his charges. Thus, it was the Cuban official who 
informed Vance of the U.S. president's statements when they met. 
  Vance apparently did not know that Carter had decided to 
make 
this announcement; embarrassed, he ended the meeting. The Cuban 
vice president added that it later became known that Cuba had 
had nothing to do with the Zaire events "but the opportunity to 
begin negotiations had passed." 
  Rodriguez indicated that the Clinton administration's 
position is based on the idea that Cuba could collapse in the 
immediate future. It is also under pressure from the most 
recalcitrant sectors of the Cuban-American community and its 
allies. 
  He added that the Clinton administration is not being 
pressed 
to make decisions and "that is why it is difficult to expect a 
change in relations between the United States and Cuba." 
  The vice president emphasized that Washington has become 
obstinate in its intent to regain its control over the island. 
He added that the possibility of a new U.S. attack was greater 
during the Republican governments of Ronald Reagan and George 
Bush. 
  Our land has not had a moment of respite in the enjoyment of 
its independence, he asserted.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Cuban President Fidel Castro by </F>
LA STAMPA reporter Jas Gawronski; place and date not given -- 
copyrighted by CLARIN] 
  [Text] [Gawronski] Cuba continues to speak about 
"revolution" and "socialism" as if there had been no changes in 
the rest of the world. Do these two words have the same meaning 
they had, in your opinion, when you started your odyssey 35 
years ago? 
  [Castro] No, they cannot have the same meaning. For two 
reasons: First, at that time we had an ambitious program that 
has to a considerable extent been implemented; second, the 
international situation has undergone decisive changes. We, 
however, remain committed to our ideals and to our social and 
political objectives. 
  [Gawronski] But hasn't the fact that communism fell to 
pieces 
in the countries in which it was in power made you conclude that 
something should also change in Cuba? 
  [Castro] I might say that communism destroyed itself, that 
it 
committed suicide in the USSR, and that it had no reason for 
committing suicide. It was a big surprise, both to us and to you 
in the Western world. All the values that were the foundations 
of that great country were destroyed. A country that rendered 
great service to mankind, because I believe the commitments 
Lenin and the October Revolution assumed are extraordinary deeds 
in mankind's history. 
  The USSR's role in the fight against fascism was crucial, 
and 
so was its role in the process of liberating old colonies. What 
I mean to say is that if the world has changed, it is because of 
the USSR's decisive contribution. I maintain that the USSR 
should not have been destroyed but improved, and that socialism 
should not have been destroyed but improved. But what was the 
result? The current unipolar world is under U.S. domination. A 
large sector of the world is suffering the consequences of this. 
  [Gawronski] But how did that happen? Do you believe 
Gorbachev 
is to blame? 
  [Castro] No. Gorbachev spoke about socialism and about 
making 
socialism more socialist, about improving socialism, not about 
destroying it. We should therefore wonder about the factors that 
caused the destruction of socialism, and how is it that what 
Hitler failed to achieve with hundreds of divisions and tens of 
thousands of planes and tanks, happened without a war, without 
armored divisions, planes, or tanks. Soviet leaders managed to 
accomplish what Hitler could not do. 
  [Gawronski] What are the current consequences of all this 
for 
Cuba? 
  [Castro] The disappearance of the socialist bloc has been a 
hard blow to us. Against the U.S. blockade we had been able to 
benefit from trade with socialist countries, which served as the 
basis for the development of our economy. The blockade is still 
in effect today but the basis has vanished, and we are being put 
to one of the toughest tests ever known in the modern era. 
  However, our decision to keep our ideals has not weakened. 
Everything shows that it was an insult to Cuba to say that we 
were a satellite of the Soviet Union. We have demonstrated that 
we were not a satellite but a star shining in its own light. 
  Moreover, although it is true that the Soviet Union has 
destroyed itself, that did not happen with China nor with 
Vietnam. Much has been said on the disappearance of socialism in 
the Soviet Union, but why does no one say anything about Chinese 
socialism? 
  [Gawronski] Do you think China is an example that must be 
followed? 
  [Castro] It is an experiment that must be studied. The 
Chinese themselves say that no one should automatically imitate 
what others are doing. They criticize themselves for 
mechanically applying the Soviet experience during its first 
years. 
  But if you want to talk about socialism, let us not forget 
what socialism achieved in China. At one time it was the land of 
hunger, poverty, disasters. Today there is none of that. Today 
China can feed, dress, educate, and care for the health of 1.2 
billion people. 
  [Gawronski] But although China has maintained a socialist 
political system, it is trying to modify its economy. On the 
other hand, Cuba seems to be still solidly socialist. Isn't it 
difficult to keep being the only socialist nation when 
everything else is changing? 
  [Castro] I think China is a socialist country, and Vietnam 
is 
a socialist nation as well. And they insist that they have 
introduced all the necessary reforms in order to motivate 
national development and to continue seeking the objectives of 
socialism. There are no fully pure regimes or systems. In Cuba, 
for instance, we have many forms of private property. We have 
hundreds of thousands of farm owners. In some cases they own up 
to 110 acres (some 150 hectares). In Europe they would be 
considered large landholders. Practically all Cubans own their 
own home and, what is more, we welcome foreign investment. 
  But that does not mean that Cuba has stopped being 
socialist. 
What is evident is that we will never fall into the error of 
destroying the country in order to begin something new. 
  [Gawronski] It could be said that in Cuba socialism has 
always been identified with you personally. Have you ever 
thought what will happen to socialism when you are no longer in 
power? 
  [Castro] I do not think socialism can be identified with me. 
I did not make it up. Of course, individuals can have a decisive 
role in a historical moment, but I have never thought socialism 
could be identified with me. That would mean depriving those 
theoreticians of socialism of such a great honor. An individual 
by himself cannot achieve anything. Only a people can do it. 
  [Gawronski] Since you assumed power, you have had to deal 
with eight U.S. presidents. Now there is Clinton, the first to 
be younger than you. Things seem to be changing. Do you think 
there will be a change in relations between the United States 
and Cuba? Is there a possibility to improve current relations? 
  [Castro] Look, U.S. presidents are slaves to many things, 
among them, electoral campaigns. During the course of their 
campaigns they make statements and commitments, and Clinton, 
unfortunately, had a hostile attitude toward Cuba. But they are 
also totally different during the first term when they are very 
careful about everything to be re-elected, and in the second 
term they seem to have their hands less tied. 
  I am not going to defend Clinton. He is not my friend nor 
foe. I am only trying to make an analysis that will allow me to 
make an objective assessment of his personality. And I have 
realized that he is very susceptible to pressures from the 
right, the most conservative elements. In a given moment he 
adopts a position and then changes as a result of pressure. What 
is happening with him is the same that happened with Kennedy in 
the beginning of his presidency. But I think he is still in the 
process of acquiring experience. 
  Clinton is also conditioned to things he inherited from 
Bush. 
Somalia, for instance. But there too a starving and disorganized 
people have been able to oppose an invasion, and I think Clinton 
has learned a lesson from that experience. He did not react 
arrogantly with new acts of aggression, with new attacks. He 
reacted in a courageous manner and with a cool mind. 
  [Gawronski] Are you trying to say that to improve relations 
with the United States it will be necessary to wait until 
Clinton is re-elected so he will no longer be conditioned to 
those forces? 
  [Castro] No one can say what will happen tomorrow. For the 
time being Clinton seems to be focusing on his electoral 
promises and on his country's internal problems. Moreover, let 
us be honest: This is a little country. We are not China, and I 
do not think the United States is particularly concerned about 
Cuba. The government has other problems it considers more 
important. 
  [Gawronski] Commander, to conclude, I would like to satisfy 
a 
personal curiosity. Why do you always wear your guerrilla 
uniform? It has been a long time since the days of the Sierra 
Maestra. 
  [Castro] These are my clothes. I have worn them throughout 
my 
life. They are comfortable and simple. They are cheap and they 
are never out of fashion. I also have another suit, a more 
formal one with a tie. But forgive me if I ask you a question: 
When you interviewed the pope, did you ask him why he always 
wears that white vestment?

"The Logic Behind Change to More Efficient Socialism"] 
  [Text] The year 1993 has entered history as the most 
difficult year for revolutionary Cuba, but also as the year of 
significant economic changes promoted by the government to 
reactivate the economy and lead the country back into the world 
market. 
  President Fidel Castro himself on 26 July announced the need 
to make changes on the island, which has been seriously battered 
by the tightening of the U.S. embargo and the crumbling of 
socialism in the former USSR and Eastern Europe. Cuba 
maintained 85 percent of its trade with this region. 
  The Caribbean country's purchasing power fell from $8 
billion 
in 1989 to 1.7 billion in 1993, for which the search and 
development of new revenue sources has become one of the main 
objectives in the struggle for national survival. 
  Political analysts agree in stating that opening the economy 
to foreign capital was the measure with the most significant 
impact on the local and international scene. It was also the 
most realistic in a country that must now purchase everything 
its needs with freely exchangeable currency. 
  The government also deregulated the holding of foreign 
currency to improve the government's income by way of the 
growing segment of the population that receives U.S. dollars 
from tourism or from relatives living abroad. 
  Some experts affirm that one decision the community 
pleasantly welcomed was the creation of the Basic Production 
Cooperative Units (UBPC) in the agriculture sector. This, in 
fact, constitutes a new concept in land exploitation methods. 
  By virtue of a government mandate, state-owned lands were 
ceded for an indefinite period of time to groups of Cubans 
interested in cultivating them. These groups, in the end, will 
share the product of the sales of their harvest to the state. 
  Fidel Castro said that this new policy improves the 
application of the socialist principle of pay according to work 
and allows better economic control of resources. 
  Up to now, the weight of agricultural production was 
primarily on the shoulders of state farms. The extreme shortage 
of oil the island has experienced this year, the lack of 
manpower, and the inefficient production levels threaten the 
ability to produce sufficient food through intensive 
agricultural activity. 
  According to local sources, the UBPC's offer greater control 
over production levels. It is expected the over 1 million Cubans 
will join these units, lured also by the possibility of 
cultivating food to supply their own family as well as increase 
their income. 
  Local media reports point out that the next 365 days will be 
another period of significant changes in Cuba, to include an 
in-depth reorganization of the state apparatus. 
  This issue will be one of the topics of debate at the Cuban 
parliamentary sessions on 27 and 28 December. The assembly is 
seeking ways to revive the country's domestic finances, which 
have deteriorated due to the excess amount of money in 
circulation -- calculated at approximately 10 billion pesos 
(equal to the same amount in U.S. dollars at the official 
exchange rate). 
  Government officials say that the assembly will analyze the 
application of a tax system and other measures, pursuant to the 
labor and salary reorganization measures directed at achieving 
greater economic efficiency and encouraging production. 
  The TRABAJADORES weekly recently reported that personnel 
rosters were to be reorganized, in light of the lack of jobs for 
the number of people in the work force. 
  The publication, mouthpiece for the Cuban Workers 
Federation, 
says that this labor reorganization would be a gradual process, 
to prevent any major impact on household economies. 
  Carlos Lage, a member of the Politburo of the Communist 
Party 
of Cuba and secretary of Council of Ministers, said that workers 
"will be moved to other centers. If this is not possible, they 
will be given part of their salary. No one will be left adrift." 
  Another novelty: Cuban television carried, during its 
coverage of the recent Central American and Caribbean Games in 
Puerto Rico, broadcast advertisements for products and 
businesses for the first time in the Cuban revolution's 35 years. 
  JUVENTUD REBELDE, the newspaper published by the Union of 
Young Communists, defended the publicity saying that it does not 
harm "the pure essence of our ideas" and allows the entry of 
currency; so necessary for the survival of the largest of the 
Antilles islands. 
  As the Cubans see it, the logic behind the changes is the 
same logic that society applies to maintain this commendable 
social balance and its survival. The ways for change will be 
never-ending, but all will follow the same political line: to 
find a more stimulating style of socialism and economy.

  [Text] Havana, 30 Dec (PL) -- Cuban tourism registered an 
increase of more than 25 percent in terms of the number of 
vacationers and gross income compared to the previous year, a 
high-ranking tourism official said today. 
  This means that slightly more than 600,000 foreigners 
visited 
tourist spots in Cuba during the past 12 months -- a period 
that, according to Enrique Rodriguez, vice president of the 
National Tourist Institute (INTUR), showed results that came 
from very hard work. 
  In brief statements to local reporters, Rodriguez said 
Cuba's 
tourism enterprises (INTUR, Cubanacan Corporation, and Gaviota 
Corporation) will work together in 1994 to boost tourism by some 
40 percent. 
  Special emphasis will be made (in 1994) to develop 
ecotourism 
and water activities (marinas and diving centers), Rodriguez 
said. 
  A noticeable gain in 1993 tourist activities also was 
registered by Cubana de Aviacion airlines, which, according to 
Director General Heriberto Prieto, carried more than 450,000 
travelers. 
  According to Prieto, aside from Cubana de Aviacion, 29 
foreign airlines fly to Cuba with 95 flights a week to nine 
tourist hubs.

Pharmaceutical Industry"] 
  [Text] [No dateline as received] At a moment when the U.S. 
blockade aimed at making the Cubans surrender out of hunger is 
being intensified, Cuba's pharmaceutical industry has risen to 
cover the back of the national economy and is now expecting high 
profits as a result of its output of products that right now are 
unique in the world. 
  In 1993, the controversy over the effectiveness of Cuban 
vaccines took new heights as a result of epidemics in Chile, 
Argentina, and Brazil and although there are reservations in 
purchasing the vaccine, threats of epidemics must be taken into 
consideration. 
  By exporting the vaccine against the meningococcic 
meningitis, interferon, the anticholestorelomic PPG, and the 
recombining streptokinase, Cuba can secure a new market that 
will be backed by the research, raw materials, and laboratories 
that have the Made in Cuba label. 
  This has come as a big surprise for transnational firms that 
unlock trade ambitions while in poor countries many people die 
for lack of vaccines that Cuba is already producing. 
  In Cuba, as in the rest of the world, the pharmaceutical 
industry is the main beneficiary of advanced technology, over 
which the highly industrialized nations almost have a monopoly. 
  This is the context into which the Cubans broke some years 
ago when the island produced a vaccine against the Type B 
Meningococcic Meningitis (the serotype that produces the most 
deaths among the infant population) and Type B Hepatitis, which 
also affects millions of Latin Americans. 
  These two vaccines are already being marketed in other 
countries. In some countries of the area, where different 
meningococcic serotypes exist, groups of experts are thinking 
about acquiring these vaccines. 
  Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 
Atlanta, the United States, and WHO have issued a positive 
assessment, the obstacles against the marketing of the vaccines 
are huge. This marketing has become a strategic field of the 
Cuban economy. At the National Forum of Science and Technology 
recently held in Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro described 
the war that has been launched from the United States against 
Cuban pharmaceutical products as terrible. 
  No one could imagine how far the Cubans would go when they 
took, in the 1980's, the short cut that biotechnology and 
genetic engineering opened to the developing countries. 
  The Cubans began producing interferon and now have a series 
of products to treat cancer, to fight infections resulting from 
the human papiloma virus, and to delay AIDS manifestations in 
persons with the HIV virus. These products are marketed by 
Heberbiotec S.A. and their effectiveness has been demonstrated. 
  More than 160 products have been obtained through genetic 
engineering, including eight medications that come as 
injections, creams, and eye-wash. 
  Although the main results derive from genetic engineering 
and 
biotechnology, progress is also being made in chemical and 
pharmaceutical products such as the anti-ulcer Qulcer, 
antibiotics, and biological remedies. 
  In 1993, the main objective of Cuba's pharmaceutical sector 
was to launch a commercial struggle in the face of a powerful 
market where 10 of the largest and most notable pharmacological 
enterprises sold more than $170-billion-worth [of products] in 
1992. 
  New formulas are presented at the island's medicine 
registration offices, thus strengthening the arsenal of 
medicines with high international demand. Some formulas are 
streptokinase (used to dissolve cardiac thrombosis) and several 
others developed from human placenta and melanin (used to cure 
vitiligo). 
  The more complex field of biotherapy has contributed with 
monoclonal antibodies. IOR-T3 was the first product to be 
registered at the state pharmaceutical control office. 
  Dr. Agustin Lage, the director of the National Molecular 
Immunology Center, told PRENSA LATINA that the center is 
currently performing clinical tests using several lymphoma 
treatments. 
  An anti-cholesterol agent, known as PPG or Ateromyxol, was 
developed with the aid of molecular biology. It is currently 
riding the crest of an advertising and sales wave among 
tourists, who come to the island looking for the "sexuality 
formula", as some have come to call these pills. 
  PPG was conceived to treat high cholesterol levels and 
presently enjoys wide acceptance for its lack of unwanted side 
effects. Patients report a general improvement of their 
circulation process and, especially, their sexual functions. 
  This effective weapon against cardiovascular disease was 
introduced to the local therapeutical scene in 1991 and in a 
1993 report issued by the University of Geneva it was recognized 
to be the best anticholesterol drug available. 
  Producing pharmaceutical products nowadays means plenty of 
scientific research. This was evident at the Fifth Cuban 
Pharmaceutical Science Congress, the National Pharmaceutical 
Technology Development Workshop, and the International 
Antibiotics Workshop, all of which were held in Havana during 
1993. 
  These events assessed the Caribbean nation's research 
potential. The island's scientists are preparing to begin the 
production of antibiotics using the method of fermentation, with 
the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). 
  Chemical development has produced other achievements such as 
the production of a cytostatic agent called "Actinomicina D," 
which, according to Dr. Carlos Vallin Ploust, a specialist at 
the Pharmaceutical Chemistry Center, is used to treat several 
types of cancer. 
  This new industry finds its resources on the ocean floor, by 
studying species that provide toxins found useful in 
neurological science. The production of hydroxyapatite, which 
is a complex phosphate calcium produced by sea coral and used as 
an excellent element for bone implants and in stomatology, has 
gained strength. 
  The most innovative discovery of the year about to close, 
was 
the cancer therapy developed from shark cartilage. A 
multidisciplinary Cuban team elaborated and expanded the 
research that began in the United States. 
  A 16-week study was carried out with terminal patients, from 
September 1993 to January 1993, under the direction of Dr. Jose 
Menendez Lopez and labeled "The New Option." 
  Dr. Lopez Menendez [name as received], in explaining the new 
cancer therapy, said that the product is registered and sold in 
the United States as a dietary supplement. There are recent 
reports, however, that indicate that they are doing clinical 
research similar to that completed in Cuba. 
  I can affirm, he said, that their results, as ours, may not 
be described as spectacular. They can, however, be seen as 
highly promising and encouraging enough to press on with this 
therapeutical effort. 
  The specialist explained that Cuba began by importing the 
product. Now, Cuba is producing shark cartilage of unsurpassed 
quality and excellence, as shown in simple spectral analysis. 
  The formula is rich in an astounding collection of 
biologically active substances with anti-inflammatory and 
angiogenetic inhibiting properties. 
  The scientist pointed out, however, that shark cartilage is 
by no means the divine nectar of the gods, nor does its use 
entail magical results. Cuban experience does recognize it 
though as the strongest neoangiogenesis inhibitor tested to date.

<F P=106> [Interview with Indios rebellion leader `Commander' Marcos, </F>
by Raffaele Crocco at San Cristobal; date not given: "Commander 
Marcos: `We Will Not Stop Before Mexico City'" -- first 
paragraph is CORRIERE DELLA SERA introduction] 
  [Text] San Cristobal -- Like all officers of the Zapatist 
Revolutionary Army [name as published], his face is covered by a 
black ski mask and his identity concealed by a nom de guerre. 
But for "Commander Marcos" -- the leader of the guerrillas who 
have occupied San Cristobal de las Casas and who are now keeping 
the army busy on the road to Ocosingo -- these seem to be the 
only elements of anonymity. Tall -- taller than the Indians who 
form his army -- and with pale skin betraying his Hispanic, 
non-Indian origins, he does not evade questions. He spent the 
entire day of the occupation explaining to people the reasons 
for the struggle. "In any case," he said, "for us war is a 
political act, not a military one. We must depend on everyone's 
support." 
  [Crocco] Why have you come out into the open only now, by 
declaring war on the Federal Government? 
  [Marcos] Look, when we opted for armed struggle we decided 
to 
prepare ourselves properly. The Zapatist army was formed 10 
years ago, and before that we tried other forms of political 
intervention which all failed. We are an army, not a guerrilla 
group. We are not interested in attacks, looting, and 
kidnapping: We are at war and we need our people. 
  [Crocco] What support do you have? 
  [Marcos] In the Southeast our support is mostly among the 
Indians. In other areas it is the peasants. 
  [Crocco] What is your objective? 
  [Marcos] To create a real democracy in Mexico. With this 
precondition, we could tackle specific problems such as a better 
distribution of wealth, observance of the Indians' rights, and a 
reform of the health and education systems. We believe that our 
country's main problem is the federal government, which is the 
result of an electoral fraud. The people do not feel that they 
are represented. 
  [Crocco] Who do you support in the government contest? 
  [Marcos] Nobody. We say that Salinas de Gortari must go, but 
we are not proposing anyone to replace him. We are demanding 
the establishment of a provisional government that will bring 
Mexico to the first free and democratic elections in its 
history. Then victory may be gained even by a party that we do 
not like, but it will have been chosen by the people. I want 
this to be clear: We do not represent any ideology. The 
Zapatist army stemmed from a group of people who wanted, and 
still want, more social justice. 
  [Crocco] But does the decision to take up arms not hinder 
the 
achievement of the democratic process? 
  [Marcos] Do you know how many people die in Chiapas every 
year? Some 15,000, killed by malnutrition and the lack of 
medicines to treat diarrhea and cholera. It is worse than the 
war in El Salvador. They are all Indians. NAFTA will make 
things worse and will cause the death of the Indians. Legal 
methods have failed. Now these people are demanding to live. 
  [Crocco] What kind of response do you expect from Salinas? 
  [Marcos] He will issue a tough response, as always. But 
there are over a million Indians in Chiapas. They cannot kill 
us all, and they will never know who is with us and who is not. 
  [Crocco] Do you enjoy any international backing? 
  [Marcos] This is our own, Mexican struggle. We do not 
receive help from abroad, from other nations. We have support 
from within: In the states of Guerrero, Michoacan, Oaxaca, and 
Veracruz people have already adhered to our declaration of war. 
  [Crocco] What will you do at the military level? 
  [Marcos] We will attack the army, avoiding as long as 
possible confrontations involving the civilian population. We 
will try to grant the military no respite. 
  [Crocco] When will this revolution end? 
  [Marcos] I do not know when; I only know how -- with the 
occupation of Mexico City.

  [Text] According to official reports, 105 people have died 
as a result of the riot in Sabaneta Prison, and approximately 60 
more were injured; some of the injured have said that the 
massacre was planned inside the prison. 
  Firemen are still in front of the prison caring for inmates 
who jumped from the third floor of the prison to avoid a raging 
fire and sustained broken bones. Some of them do not know how 
the massacre started; others say that hooded individuals 
initiated a war that culminated with the death of innocent 
people. Apparently, the people involved in these incidents are 
very dangerous. 
  [Begin recording] [Lieutenant Colonel Aldo Bocony, Zulia 
State National Guard commander] We removed the bodies of 101 
inmates and 49 injured people yesterday. Of the 49, two died 
later. The official count so far is 103 dead. There are 15 
inmates registered in various local hospitals right now. 
  [Judge Salvador Cubillan] This was the result of a vendetta 
from inmates in the rehabilitation area of the prison against 
inmates in another area. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Why a vendetta? 
  [Cubillan] For having banning visits Sunday, when shots were 
fired; as a reprisal, these inmates tried this. 
  [Reporter] How many bodies have been identified? 
  [Cubillan] Approximately 60. [end recording] 
  Once informed of the tragedy, Justice Minister Fermin Marmol 
Leon arrived in Maracaibo to meet with Governor Lolita Aniyar de 
Castro and to inspect the prison. Marmol Leon said that in view 
of this situation, security measures will be adopted. These 
measures include the transfer of certain inmates to other prison 
centers as well, and, most important, as thorough changes in the 
prison directorship. [sentence as heard] 
  [Begin recording] [Marmol Leon] Perhaps our judicial 
processes are too slow. I do not want to say that the Judicial 
Branch is to blame for what has happened. I am going to present 
to the new Congress a bill calling for reforms to the criminal 
trials code so that this procedure can move faster. Perhaps 
this will help those being tried. 
  [Aniyar de Castro] We are going to appoint a new team to 
direct this prison and a new guard personnel. We have been in 
contact with the Rafael Urdaneta Center, which is in charge of 
building new prisons, so that it will build a prison as soon as 
possible, perhaps before December, even if only half of the 
cells are ready at that time, and we are going to use space 
available in the National Prison, which was partially set on 
fire, to take some preventive measures that will help until the 
new prison begins functioning. [end recording] 
  Regarding this massacre in the National Prison of Sabaneta, 
Maracaibo, it has been reported that the prison system director 
will be arriving in Maracaibo within the next few hours to 
initiate the transfer of the individuals responsible for this 
accident, which has shocked both the national and international 
public.

  [Text] In order to facilitate the pardoning of soldiers 
who participated in the 4 February and 27 November coup 
attempts, President Ramon J. Velasquez urged them to abide by 
the law so that decisions in that regard can be made within the 
legal framework. 
  President Velasquez is studying the possibility of issuing a 
new list of soldiers to be pardoned, including officers who 
sought asylum in Peru. He invited them to return to the 
country, guaranteeing their safety. He stressed that Venezuela 
is ruled by laws based on the Constitution, which is a guarantee 
for all Venezuelans.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 4 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  On 28 December, the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) 
auctioned 
4 billion bolivares ($37.77 million) worth of "zero coupon" 
bonds. The bonds, due on 30 March 94, will have a yield of 50.54 
percent, two points less than the previous week. Brokerage 
firms took $22 million worth of the bonds, financial firms $8 
million, and commercial banks $7.7 million. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 2208 GMT 28 Dec 93) 
  The Central Statistics and Data Processing Office (OCEI) 
reported on 29 December that unemployment in Venezuela at the 
end of 1993 was 6.6 percent, while the so-called "informal 
sector" of the economy grew by 116,700 jobs and employed 40.8 
percent of the working population. OCEI also reported that the 
economically active population totals 7,582,345; 93.4 percent 
were employed during the second half of 1993. It added that the 
government eliminated 65,000 jobs and employed 1,198,611 
workers, 16.9 percent of the country's work force. (Madrid EFE 
in Spanish 2112 GMT 29 Dec 93) 
  Energy and Mines Minister Alirio Parra said the state budget 
for PDVSA (Venezuelan Petroleum) for 1994 is 1.065 trillion 
bolivares, based on a price per barrel of oil of $13.50. 
Profits are expected to be approximately $12 billion. He added 
that 1994 exports will be 2.23 million barrels per day and that 
the operational objectives of the budget aim at increasing the 
country's reserves by 172 million barrels through exploration of 
new areas. Regarding PDVSA's affiliates abroad, the minister 
said they should net $142 million with an investment of $536 
million. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL In Spanish 31 Dec 93 p 2-6) 
  The BCV reported on 2 January that Venezuela's international 
reserves dropped $324 million during 1993, closing the year at 
$12.677 billion. However, the reduction of international 
reserves in 1993 was still less than the reduction registered in 
1992 when they dropped $1.104 billion. In December 1993 
Venezuela's international reserves increased $261 million. 
(Paris AFP in Spanish 2241 GMT 2 Jan 94) 
  The BCV reported on 3 January that 1993 inflation was 45.9 
percent, the second highest in 35 years, surpassed only by the 
81 percent inflation rate registered in 1989. The BCV added 
that in December prices increased 3.6 percent. The state bank 
also reported that implementation of the value-added tax in 
October caused the inflation rate of December to increase 0.4 
percent, less than the 0.6 percent November increase. Inflation 
in 1993 surpassed the 1992 rate -- 31.9 percent -- by 14 points; 
it is expected that in 1994 it will drop and remain between 35 
percent and 40 percent. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2124 GMT 3 Jan

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 4 Jan (AFP) -- The American 
troops who occupy Bahia Malaga in Valle Department in the 
country's southern Pacific coast area prepared to establish a 
military surveillance complex to watch the Pacific seaboard, the 
morning newspaper LA PRENSA of Santa Fe de Bogota reported 
today. Under the headline "Marines Know How To Radar" -- a play 
on the Spanish words equivalent to radar and swim, which sound 
similar in Spanish -- LA PRENSA says the United States will 
install radar sites which will be connected to the radar network 
already installed in Central America. 
  The arrival of between 120 and 150 U.S. soldiers, who, 
according to the Colombian Government, started to arrive on 28 
December as part of a civilian project construction agreement, 
has aroused a lively controversy among political leaders. The 
government says the U.S. soldiers' presence deals with the 
construction of schools, health posts, and several kilometers of 
roads in Juanchaco on the Pacific coast. LA PRENSA, however, 
has reported: "The U.S. Marines in Bahia Malaga intend mainly 
to conduct preliminary studies for the construction of a complex 
network of radar sites at a place regarded by the U.S. 
Government as the most strategic on the Pacific Ocean, near the 
Panama Canal." 
  Citing a report from its special correspondent Fernando 
Cortes, LA PRENSA, an opposition conservative paper, says the 
first radar site would cover from Bahia Solano on the coast to 
Panama and would link up with radar sites installed in Central 
America and the Caribbean, including Colombian-owned San Andres 
island. The paper reports that with these sites the Pentagon 
seeks to curb drug trafficking in the Pacific because the 
Governments of Colombia and the United States have for a long 
time been aware of the growing number of Cali Cartel routes in 
this area. 
  LA PRENSA further adds that 36 U.S. engineers are already in 
Bahia Malaga and that others are scheduled to arrive aboard 
several Black Hawk helicopters today. "They will be flown in 
directly from the Southern Command in Panama, and along the 
Humboldt current, in very covert flights to avert new incidents 
with the public if Colombian radar discovers them," LA PRENSA 
said.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 4 Jan (EFE) -- 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said today, Tuesday, that the 
presence of approximately 170 U.S. soldiers in the country is 
following a "civic objective," because they will perform a 
"humanitarian" task. 
  This was the first time Gaviria has commented on the arrival 
of the U.S. Engineers Battalion on 27 December and 2 January. 
According to the government, the U.S. soldiers will build a 
school, a clinic, and a road in an area on the Colombian Pacific 
coast. 
  Since the U.S. Embassy announced the soldiers' arrival at 
the 
beginning of December in Santa Fe de Bogota, the presence of 
U.S. soldiers in Colombia has caused a big uproar in the country. 
  Referring to the presence of the U.S. soldiers in the 
Colombian Pacific area, President Gaviria said: "It is 
absolutely clear to the government that the soldiers' arrival 
has an explicit civic objective." The Colombian president made 
those statements to a group of journalists in the town of San 
Basilio de Palenque, near Cartagena de Indians, on the country's 
northern Caribbean coast. Gaviria added that the government has 
no reservations or problem with any type of "citizen control" 
observing that the "Marines'" work is totally "humanitarian." 
  "While their presence is of a humanitarian nature, I do not 
understand why it would cause concern," the Colombian president 
said, after denying any possibility that the soldiers are 
attempting to build a military base in national territory. "Such 
a project cannot be carried out behind the people's backs," the 
Colombian head of state said. 
  The U.S. Embassy has reported that the U.S. military 
engineers would participate in an exercise program with the 
Colombian Armed Forces in an area of the Pacific Ocean, in the 
southwestern Department of Valle del Cauca. According to 
diplomatic representation, the program is called "Strong Roads 
Colombia 94," and the "Marines," who belong to the U.S. Southern 
Command stationed in Panama, will remain in the country until 
the end of February.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 3 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Rodolfo Uribe, director of the National Administrative 
Department of Statistic (DANE) has disclosed that inflation in 
Colombia during 1993 had reached 22.6 percent, 2.5 points less 
that in 1992. He indicated that despite the government's 
inability to reach its 22 percent inflation goal, it came pretty 
close, evidence that "it is winning the battle against 
inflation." Uribe recalled that in 1993 accumulated inflation 
in Colombia reached 25.13 percent. In December 1993, cost of 
living increased most in Cali at 1.67 percent, followed closely 
by Medellin with 1.46 percent. Santa Fe de Bogota recorded 
inflation of 1.03 percent in December. Colombian cities with 
the lowest increase in cost of living were Cucuta with 0.85 
percent and Pasto with 0.15 percent. President Cesar Gaviria's 
administration has set 19 percent as the 1994 inflation goal. 
(Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1752 GMT 2 Jan 94) 
  Figures made public today by DANE reveal that unemployment 
fell during 1993 from 9.6 percent to 7.9 percent. According to 
DANE figures, unemployment levels in the four leading 
metropolitan areas of Santa Fe de Bogota, Cali, Medellin, and 
Barranquilla were less than 7.6 percent. The report also 
reveals that the private sector created at least 75,000 jobs in 
the past year. Unemployment in the four leading metropolitan 
areas during December totalled approximately 354,000, of an 
economically active labor market of 4.7 million Colombians. 
(Madrid EFE in Spanish 2041 GMT 28 Dec 93) 
  Gasoline prices were adjusted by 19 percent throughout 
Colombia on 27 December. The price of regular gasoline 
increased from 578 to 688 pesos, and premium gasoline prices 
increased from 718 to 854 pesos. Cocinol, fuel distributed 
mainly in Santa Fe de Bogota's lower income communities, rose 
from 85 to 100 pesos, or 17.65 percent. It is the first time in 
six years that the government has increased gasoline prices 
based on the 1994 inflation goal of 19 percent. Previously, 
price adjustments were implemented with the intention of 
covering fluctuations in the cost of living index during the 
current year. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 20 Dec 
93 pp 1a, 8a)

  The Exports and Investments Center of Costa Rica on 28 
December reported that sales of products and services to foreign 
nations increased more than 50 percent between 1990 and 1993, 
although the trade balance is in deficit. According to the 
Central Bank, imports in 1990 amounted to $1.98 billion, whereas 
in 1993 they reached $3 billion. The same source added that the 
1993 trade balance has an $800 million deficit. (Mexico City

to be used for several months while some adjustments are made. 
(San Jose Radio Reloj in Spanish 1730 GMT 29 Dec 93) 
  Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier 
reported 
on 3 January that inflation during 1993 was 9.05 percent. 
Economy Minister Roberto Rojas explained that this was due to a 
reduction in the prices of many items after some taxes were 
lifted in April. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0007 GMT 4 Jan

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 3 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  The construction sector grew substantially in 1993. The 
Panamanian Chamber of Construction reports construction permits 
were issued for $327 million, a 60-percent increase in value 
over permits issued in 1992 -- $252 million were issued in 
Panama City and $80 million were issued to the public sector. 
The figures reveal 25,000 workers were directly employed in the 
construction sector and 15,000 were indirectly employed. 
(Panama City Circuito RPC Television Network in Spanish 2300 
GMT 30 Dec 93) 
  Roy Cardenas, director of marine resources in the Ministry 
of 
Commerce and Industry, says although Panamanian industrialists 
claim they have lost $60 million due to the U.S.'s tuna embargo, 
the actual loss is only $30 million. (Panama City EL SIGLO in 
Spanish 29 Dec 93 p 12) 
  A recent study by Rosa Elena de la Cruz of the Planning and 
Economic Policy Ministry states that economic growth by itself 
is not enough to reduce poverty. Unemployment dropped 20 
percent in 1990 and 13.6 percent in 1992. In 1991, poverty was 
reduced to 48.5 percent and in 1992 to 40 percent of the 
population. Rural poverty is becoming urban poverty as the poor 
move to the cities. (Panama City LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in

  [Text] San Salvador, 4 Jan (AFP) -- Salvadoran President 
Alfredo Cristiani said today he will travel to Mexico to offer 
the Mexican Government "cooperation" to solve the crisis there 
after armed clashes broke out in that country over the weekend. 
  "We are willing to cooperate with the Mexican Government in 
whatever it believes we can cooperate," Cristiani told a news 
conference. The Salvadoran president asked today the 
Legislative Assembly for permission to leave the country, and 
according to the president, he "might" go to Mexico this weekend. 
  Cristiani said that he was "disappointed" by the outbreak of 
clashes between the Mexican Armed Forces and the so-called 
Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), which supports 
demands of the very poor Indian population in Chiapas State, on 
the border with Guatemala. 
  Along with Spain, Colombia, and Venezuela, Mexico forms part 
of the "group of friendly countries" which supported the 
negotiations between the Cristiani government and the former 
rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, which 
in 1992 ended a 12-year-old civil war in El Salvador.

  [Text] San Salvador, 4 Jan (AFP) -- The former Salvadoran 
guerrilla group Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) 
flatly rejected today any links with the rebel group that is 
occupying towns in southern Mexico. 
  Denying the participation of former Salvadoran guerrillas in 
the Mexican guerrilla movement, Juan Ramon Medrano, one of the 
former FMLN commanders, said "it is extremely speculative" to 
make charges when there is no "concrete proof" about an alleged 
Central American participation in the uprising. 
  A senior Mexican Government official said on 3 January that 
Central American guerrillas might be involved in the armed 
actions of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), which 
publicly appeared on 1 January and has been involved in clashes 
with the Mexican Army. According to the latest official 
figures, the fighting has left 86 people dead. 
  "There is much speculation. Our only responsibility has been 
to serve as an example," Medrano said, adding that the FMLN 
waged a civil war in El Salvador for more than 10 years. 
  Medrano, current FMLN propaganda chief, said that the armed 
actions that broke out in the last few days in southern Chiapas 
State, on the border with Guatemala, "sound a warning bell that 
the Mexican Government should hear." The leader of the former 
guerrilla movement said that Mexican President Carlos Salinas, 
who firmly supported the peace process in El Salvador, "has 
shown that he has a modern outlook, so we trust he will hear the 
demands" of the rebels. 
  Medrano added that the causes of the outbreak of violence in 
Chiapas are deeply rooted in the economic and social problems of 
the people of the region.

an economic upswing in El Salvador but warned that "economic 
growth must be maintained until the year 2000 to recover 
pre-1978 levels." (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 29 
Dec 93 p 3) 
  The 1992-93 coffee harvest reached 3.3 million quintals, 
while the 1993-94 crop is expected to reach 2 million quintals. 
Some of the reasons for the reduced production is the 
development of new neighborhoods on land previously used for 
growing coffee, the lack of adequate attention to coffee 
plantations, and the 20 percent export retention in force since 
October to improve prices. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1935 
GMT 30 Dec 93)

  [Text] Guatemalan Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias 
said yesterday that the comeback of guerrillas in Mexico will 
help Guatemala, because the Mexican Government will cut off its 
aid to Guatemalan rebels to wage its own war. 
  He added: Although war actions taking place a few kilometers 
from our border with Mexico are dangerous, Guatemala could 
benefit from the armed movement in that country, because if the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity supports openly that 
movement it will lose the sympathy that it has enjoyed in Mexico 
during certain moments. 
  Herbruger said during a news conference that he thinks it is 
important for our country to adopt certain precautionary 
measures to protect its border, without interfering in Mexico's 
domestic affairs. 
  The Guatemalan official believes that the Mexicans will 
react 
negatively to the armed movement, because the people who live in 
countries with constitutional regimes do not welcome violent 
changes. 
  Meanwhile, Presidency Secretary General Hector Luna Troccoli 
has said that the armed movement that has reemerged in Mexico is 
a source of concern, because it threatens that country's 
political stability, which has been traditional for over 60 
years. 
  He added: It must be admitted, however, that the uprising is 
understandable due to the extreme poverty in which the people of 
Mexico's northern and southeastern region live, and this 
situation, added to the political wear out of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, has caused the situation that exists now. 
  Meanwhile, Felix Loarca Guzman, public relations secretary 
of 
the Presidency, has said that the guerrilla movement in Mexico 
is a domestic matter of that country and the Guatemalan 
Government cannot issue any opinion in that regard.

  [Editorial Report] Madrid EFE in Spanish at 0227 GMT 4 
January, in a Mexico City datelined item, reports that on 3 
January the Guatemalan guerrilla movement confirmed in Mexico 
City that it is preparing to meet with Guatemalan Government 
officials between 6 and 9 January. The guerrilla announcement 
also pointed out that it will not discuss the government's peace 
proposal during the meeting. The Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity, URNG, recently indicated through a 
communique that "the meeting which is intended to establish the 
foundations for renewing the peace process negotiation which was 
interrupted last May, cannot be used to discuss the government's 
peace plan, nor is said peace plan discussion part of the 
meeting." The URNG insists that the meeting's main objective is 
to search for alternatives leading to a resumption of peace 
negotiations that will end the 33-year-old civil war. The 
announcement also specifies that "the URNG considers the 
progress accomplished during the Oslo 1990 and Mexico 1991 
negotiations as inalienable. The URNG position will be to 
preserve the content of the negotiation and the agreements 
improved by the civilian society and the conciliating role 
played by Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada." 
  According to a Guatemala datelined report by Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish at 0109 GMT on 4 January, the Permanent 
Commission for Refugees in Mexico reiterated on Monday that 
during 1994, it will continue with plans to repatriate 
approximately 20,000 Guatemalan Indians to their country as 
scheduled. Commission Leader Ricardo Curtz told NOTIMEX that 
violence initiated by armed groups operating in the southeastern 
Mexican State of Chiapas, bordering on Guatemala, will not 
affect the repatriation program. Curtz also denied that the 
violence would bring negative repercussions to life in the 
refugee camps which provide shelter to at least 40,000 Indian 
refugees who fled to Mexico during the 1980's. The commission 
leader pointed out that the return of 1,000 refugees housed in 
the Chiapas refugee camp is scheduled for 12 January and that 
they will be relocated to a camp set up in Huehuetenango. It is 
expected that 20,000 refugees out of the 40,000 in Mexico will 
be repatriated during 1994. 
  Guatemalan Indian leader Rosalina Tuyuc warned on Monday 
that 
the guerrilla uprising in Mexico "is the result of lack of 
solutions to problems confronted by the Indian and peasant 
communities" which could extend to other nations throughout the 
continent. In a Guatemala City datelined report by Paris AFP in 
Spanish at 2343 GMT of 3 January, the Indian leader pointed out 
that "the methods used by the Mexican rebels to redeem their 
rights could be repeated in other countries of America since 
legal or political mechanisms seem very inadequate" to 
eliminating discrimination against indigenous populations. 
Tuyuc is the one of the main leaders of the National Commission 
of Guatemalan Widows, Conavigua. She proceeds to explain that 
actions by the guerrilla groups controlling several communities 
of the Mexican state of Chiapas "cannot be praised or 
criticized," and also pointed out that "they have their reasons 
for embarking on an armed struggle." The Conavigua leader 
specifically points out that despite everything that is taking 
place, "the Guatemalan refugees should not be associated" with 
the conflict. On the other hand, Rigoberta Menchu, a Guatemalan 
Indian leader and 1992 Nobel Peace Prize laureate currently 
living in Mexico, expressed her concern about the repercussions 
the uprising could have on her country's refugees.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemala economic developments monitored through 3 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Finance Minister Richard Aitkenhead has announced the 
government has felt it advisable to allow competition in some 
services provided by state enterprises such as INDE (National 
Institute of Electrification) and Guatel (Guatemalan 
Telecommunications Enterprise) to make these enterprises more 
operational and profitable. He added this is the first step 
before privatization. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 28 
Dec 93 p 53) 
  William Stixrud, president of the National Coffee 
Association 
(Asociacion Nacional del Cafe) has said that approximately 
389,560 quintals of coffee, worth over $24 million, were 
exported during the 1992-93 harvest. He added that Guatemala 
continues to withhold 20 percent of its coffee exports. 
(Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 29 Dec 93 p 62) 
  As of 30 November, approximately 119,000 export permits, 
totaling $1.8128 billion, had been issued. Of this amount, 
$1.2395 billion were nontraditional exports. With regard to 
traditional export values, coffee rose $17 million, cotton 
dropped $6 million, sugar rose $8 million, meat rose $3.4 
million. During 1992-93, exports of traditional products rose 
$92 million in markets outside Central America and $24 million 
in the regional market. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 
30 Dec 93 p 63) 
  Guatemala Bank President Willy Zapata said on 30 December 
that the exchange rate fell from 5.25 at the beginning of 1993 
to 5.77 percent on 29 December, a 9.9 percent depreciation. 
Zapata also said the money supply for 1993 grew 11.7 percent, 
or 348.7 million quetzales. He added that in 1994 the bank will 
seek to induce an interest rate reduction so as to generate 
increased investment. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 31

<F P=106> [Letter of congratulations from Daniel Ortega Saavedra, </F>
secretary general of the Nicaraguan Sandinist National 
Liberation Front, to Cuban President Fidel Castro on the 
occasion of the 35th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution dated 1 
Jan] 
  [Text] Managua, 1 January 1994 
  Commander Fidel Castro Ruz, 
  President of the Council of State and Council of Ministers 
  of the Republic of Cuba 
  Secretary General of the CC [Central Committee] of the PCC 
[Communist Party of Cuba] 
  Havana 
  Dear Fidel: 
  On this first day of January 1994, the Cuban people are 
celebrating the 35th anniversary of the victory of the Cuban 
Revolution. The Nicaraguan people, especially the Sandinists, 
happily join in celebrating this historic date, which symbolizes 
freedom and dignity for the Cuban people, the Latin American and 
Caribbean peoples, and the peoples from the North and South who 
have been able to appreciate the importance of this event. 
  In its 35 years, the Cuban Revolution has been able to 
overcome the many obstacles placed by the intolerant U.S. 
Governments: the blockade, the attacks, the invasions, the sting 
operations, and the slanderous campaigns. All these obstacles, 
among others, have sought to deny the Cuban people their right 
to self-determination. 
  Marti's people have not weakened or given up during these 35 
years; on the contrary, they have risen amid the aggressors' 
onslaughts. Cuba has been able to resist and show solidarity to 
the world's peoples. The Nicaraguan people have indelible and 
priceless memories of the generosity of these heroic people. 
  A century is about to end, and a new millennium is about to 
start, but it is painful to see how, despite the meteoric 
technological developments achieved by humanity, we will reach 
the next millennium without having eradicated famine, poverty, 
and the degradation of human beings. Quite the contrary, such 
scourges have worsened in most countries. It is even more 
painful to see how the U.S. Governments, acting above national 
and international laws with impunity, have been the first to 
deny Cuban people the right to build freely a society free of 
illiteracy and high infant mortality, and, above all, a society 
that is dignifying for human beings. 
  On this 35th anniversary of the victory of the Cuban 
Revolution, may you, Comrade Fidel, the Cuban people, and your 
party receive tokens of love and solidarity from the people of 
Augusto Sandino and Ruben Dario. We trust that Cuba will reach 
the next century with a stronger revolution that is free of the 
U.S. blockade and the meddling of U.S. rulers. 
  Greetings from the Sandinist National Liberation Front and 
from the Nicaraguan people. Best wishes for you and your people. 
Fraternally, 
[Signed] Daniel Ortega Saavedra

  [Excerpt] The First Special Congress of the Sandinist 
National Liberation Front [FSLN] will be held on 20 May 1994. 
The agenda includes issues that are essential to the existence 
of the FSLN and points in three directions: reform of the 
statutes, reform of the program, and election of authorities. 
  Prior to the congress and starting in January 1994, the 
organizing commission -- headed by FSLN founder Tomas Borge 
Martinez -- will make an intense effort in all the country's 
departments to ensure the participation of the Sandinist 
delegates and members in the preparatory debates. [passage

  [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar yesterday stated 
that in a letter sent to the U.S. Embassy, the Bolivian 
Government made it clear that it acts and will continue to act 
in keeping with its domestic legislation. It further stated 
that it condemns any interference in matters that come under its 
sole jurisdiction. 
  The foreign minister made this public after reporting that 
he 
had received a letter from the U.S. Embassy, bearing seal number 
466, in which the U.S. Government expressed its disagreement 
with the alleged granting of a pardon to a person implicated in 
terrorist crimes. 
  Aranibar stated that it is incumbent upon the Bolivian 
Government, to the exclusion of everybody else, to grant or not 
to grant a pardon to persons involved in some crimes, and that 
all the different levels of the judiciary abide by the country's 
legislation. 
  The foreign minister further stated that last 29 November he 
had received a verbal note from the U.S. Embassy, in which it 
voiced its opinion about the alleged granting of a pardon to a 
Bolivian citizen, Marcelo Oliva, who was implicated in an attack 
on the U.S. "Marines'" residence. 
  "We answered them through another verbal note, as 
appropriate, stressing that that was a matter that comes under 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bolivian Government," he 
explained. 
  He thus indicated that the different levels of the judiciary 
will respect the country's rules and legislation, which 
establish with striking clarity the independence of the three 
branches of government and the duties of each of them. 
  According to the foreign minister's statement, the long and 
the short of it is that the Foreign Ministry has made it clear 
that "the Bolivian Government acts and will act pursuant to the 
country's legislation." He went on to say that the Bolivian 
Government likewise condemns any interference in matters that 
come under its sovereign decision. 
  With regard to the "not too friendly" tone of the letter 
issued by the U.S. Embassy, Aranibar said that the Foreign 
Ministry's response to it was couched "in the tone, terms, and 
firmness suitable to the occasion." 
  In its letter the U.S. Embassy states that "the 
traditionally 
excellent relations existing between our countries may be 
adversely affected if a pardon is granted to terrorists or if 
any other measure is taken to release them." 
  To this effect, it points out that "the United States will 
hold responsible any individual who, directly or indirectly, 
supports terrorist actions against U.S. citizens or U.S. 
interests." 
  The letter openly accuses the Pro-Amnistia group for its 
activities toward obtaining a pardon for citizens who have been 
taken into custody on terrorist charges. It even threatens with 
applying all sorts of retaliatory measures if a pardon is indeed 
granted to these people.

  [Text] Justice Ernesto Poppe Zubieta yesterday said during 
a news conference: They could not find any evidence against me 
in either the Ibarra or the Meco Domingez case. The United 
States is interested in having me removed from office because I 
demanded to know where the property and assets seized from drug 
traffickers ended up. I was against Supreme Decree 21060 
because it was inhuman. I rejected Article 55 of that law, 
which supported private businessmen, enabling them to hire 
workers without due regard for their rights. 
  I am a genuine member of the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary 
Movement] Party, but of the historical and loyal MNR, not the 
MNR that lets its name be used so that the United States may 
govern our country through a gringo made in Bolivia. 
  This trial is totally ridiculous. It is a political and 
biased trial. Nothing was proved against me. The Bolivian 
state is overburdened with corruption, so much so that 
corruption has become the property of the Bolivian Government. 
Corrupt practices are rampant in the three branches of 
government -- the Executive, the Legislative Branch, and lower 
levels of the judiciary. Malfeasance and corruption are 
prevalent in the judiciary because there are no mechanisms in 
force to prevent this, such as better salaries and wages, or 
increasing the number of judges to prevent the backlog of work.

<F P=106> [Interview with Government Minister German Quiroga by Mario </F>
Canipa Vargas in La Paz -- no date given] 
  [Excerpts] [Canipa] The government has been making changes 
since its inauguration last August. It is insisting on making 
changes. What are the changes made in your ministry? 
  [Quiroga] There are three basic aspects we want to change in 
the transition from the old Interior Ministry to the new 
Government Ministry. 
  The first is related to the intelligence services, which 
terrified the people. This was the part of the state that 
investigated the possibility of a coup, of sedition. But we now 
believe that under a modern and established democracy like ours, 
these services must contribute to people's security, and along 
with its basic organization -- which is the police -- should 
support Bolivians and give them daily security. 
  We are working on it. The first step taken is to 
institutionalize the intelligence services and put them in the 
hands of the police in order to prevent them from becoming an 
instrument of the political power that happens to be in charge 
of the Government Ministry. 
  [Canipa] Is there no longer a Government Ministry 
intelligence service? 
  [Quiroga] There is an intelligence service in the Government 
Ministry that depends on the police, and all its members are 
part of the Bolivian police. 
  This is closely linked to the changes in the police as part 
of the first aspect. [passage omitted] 
  [Canipa] What will happen with the struggle against drug 
trafficking? Will it be included in these changes? 
  [Quiroga] Of course. To start with, we have changed the 
Social Defense Secretariat, which once was exclusively linked to 
the issue of coca and cocaine. It now has a wider role involving 
prevention and interdiction. 
  Although interdiction had been an important role, we believe 
alternative development is also an essential issue. It will not 
be possible to achieve an adequate replacement for surplus coca 
production if we are not able to find an economic solution. 
  The only way that an individual who grows coca stops doing 
it 
is when he realizes that growing another product is more 
profitable than growing coca from the economic point of view. 
  This is what we are working on. We have taken control of the 
fund for alternative development by changing its structure. We 
created an executive board presided over by a delegate of the 
president of the Republic, and its responsibility is shared by 
the Executive Branch and coca producers. 
  We would like to see the executive board create the ideas to 
carry out alternative development. 
  Eradication will be linked to alternative development. In 
those places where eradication is being carried out there will 
be alternative development, and where alternative development 
took place it was because there was a reduction in coca growing. 
  But I am not saying that we will eliminate interdiction. We 
will continue the work being carried out in the country but 
interdiction will be exclusively against drug traffickers, not 
against coca growers or people involved in the legal 
commercialization of coca. 
  We have a Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] that is an 
example for Latin America, and we will continue to support it 
because we believe that interdiction is essential. We also will 
carry out prevention as an overall part of our strategy, and 
this is why we created the Social Prevention Under Secretariat, 
which will deal with alcoholism, drug addiction, and crimes. 
This organization will help try to prevent these evils in 
society through teaching programs. 
  [Canipa] To talk about successful and real alternative 
development, not just in speeches the way it is now, means 
talking about resources. How will you finance the alternative 
development projects to become a reality? 
  [Quiroga] We are talking about three basic sources of 
financing. The first is the resource that drug trafficking 
itself produces. The country has many resources from drug 
trafficking that are lost with time. We are talking about a 
great deal of money, many assets that have been disappearing. 
  The one responsible was first the Interior Ministry; later 
it 
was a shared responsibility between prosecutors and the Interior 
Ministry. Now it is the responsibility of prosecutors and the 
judges who hand over the assets to trustees who later disappear. 
  We will propose that the Legislative Branch change the law 
to 
be able to immediately auction confiscated assets to create a 
common fund to support the people found innocent after their 
assets were confiscated. 
  With this fund we hope to finance 30 to 35 percent of the 
alternative development programs. 
  The second resource will be multinational organizations. The 
United Nations and the Inter-American Development Bank are 
interested in carrying out alternative development programs 
under the concept that the only way to do it adequately is 
through the industrialization of the areas where surplus coca is 
grown. 
  The third financing resource is the United States with 
bilateral aid. That country gave about $20 million to $25 
million annually for alternative development, but a large part 
of those resources were used to pay salaries and not necessarily 
to carry out alternative development. 
  With these three resources, which are not from the national 
Treasury, in addition to some funds from the national budget, we 
believe we can carry out a good alternative development policy. 
  [Canipa] Regarding interdiction, there has been a great deal 
of talk about the presence of Colombian drug traffickers in 
Bolivia. Is that true? 
  [Quiroga] We have information about new technology. The 
technology used in the country is different from that used by 
the Medellin and Cali cartels. But in the last two years we have 
seen that the technology to produce coca and cocaine in the 
country has quickly improved. And this makes the narcotics 
intelligence organizations think there is permanent and decisive 
cooperation by the Colombian drug cartels. 
  Another aspect is that probably 80 percent of the drug 
produced in the country goes to Colombia. Whether it goes to 
Paraguay, Argentina, or Brazil, its final destination is 
Colombia, where the last stage of purification is made before it 
is sent to the United States. 
  Perhaps this is the most important reason to continue with 
interdiction, to prevent Colombian drug traffickers from 
establishing themselves in our country. 
  [Canipa] Does this represent a threat of violence ...? 
  [Quiroga] Without a doubt, this may represent violence 
because the mafia is violent and we will not send nuns from a 
convent to fight against them. We must send outstanding officers 
against them because this is a war, a war in which the 
government, the police, have to fulfill the laws when the other 
side violates them. 
  Drug traffickers violate sovereignty, hurt the population by 
threatening them, and also murder with impunity. 
  It is an unjust struggle because one side has laws and 
regulations to fulfill while the other side has absolutely no 
restrictions. 
  [Canipa] Do you have a list of the main drug traffickers in 
the country? Who heads the list? 
  [Quiroga] We have a permanent list that undergoes changes 
based on arrests. The number one in the country is "Meco" 
Dominguez, who was sentenced but later escaped; he is at large. 
  There is also a list of nine individuals who are a number 
one 
priority for FELCN. Only two months ago the number one on that 
list was "Nando" Gutierrez, who was captured. As you can see it 
is a list that changes periodically. 
  We have a FELCN that is very efficient but the DEA's 
cooperation in this work must be recognized.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Jan (NA) -- Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo has said that in 1994 the economy will grow by 6 or 7 
percent, investments will increase by 15 percent, and exports 
will increase by 10 percent. 
  The minister said that 1994 will be "a very good year" in 
macroeconomic terms, and that inflation will be "below 5 
percent." 
  Cavallo said that next year's great challenge will be the 
construction of new factories "to expand productive activities 
in the interior of the country, permit investments, and allow 
the creation of job opportunities and goods and services 
demanded by the people." 
  Cavallo reiterated that in order to achieve these objectives 
it is necessary to reach an agreement with the provinces -- 
through the fiscal pact -- in order to reduce taxes on 
productive activities and so reduce costs. 
  The minister said that the program will be complemented by 
"strong investments by the private sector and the provinces in 
roads, telecommunications, energy, railroads, and ports." 
  Cavallo said that increases in exports should be derived not 
from the fluctuations in international prices, but from the 
"increase in exportable volume." The minister forecast "an 
important increase in the export of hydrocarbons -- oil and gas 
-- as well as in agricultural products." Cavallo said that in 
1993 the export of industrial manufactured products increased by 
22 percent with respect to 1992. 
  The minister said that of the $1 billion 1993 increase in 
imports over 1992, "$900 million were the result of importation 
of capital goods." 
  Cavallo made these statements in an interview published by 
the magazine NOTICIAS. The minister said that in 1993 
"consumption increased by 4 percent while the gross domestic 
product increased by 6 percent, which means that national 
savings have also increased." 
  The minister said that "all investments will be financed by 
our internal savings" by the year 2000. "This does not mean we 
will reject foreign capital, but I hope by then local companies 
will be investing outside of the country." 
  Regarding the 1994 fiscal account, Cavallo said: "It has 
been demonstrated to the IMF, and to all those who had doubts 
about the current Argentine Government economic policies, that 
we can lower tax rates, or eliminate them, and still increase 
our tax collections through the legalization of the country's 
economy." 
  Cavallo stressed that economists who predicted that the 
government would not be able to fulfill the year's fiscal goals 
were wrong, and will this year be wrong again. The minister 
added that the government will continue to improve on the tax 
administration system, will increase its austerity in the area 
of spending, and will intensify the fight on corruption using 
the criteria of equality and efficiency in the use of resources. 
  Cavallo pointed out that Santiago del Estero proved that 
"those who wanted to get votes with demagoguery and by 
squandering local resources will think twice before doing it 
again." "You can also win elections with austerity," Cavallo 
said, adding that "we must terminate the payment of exorbitant 
salaries and state purchases from contractors."

  [Text] (NA) -- The cost of services has gone up by as much 
as 157 percent since the start of convertibility, the UADE 
[Argentine Business University] Argentine business university 
reported yesterday. 
  Some of the figures released by the UADE register almost 
triple the 53 percent inflation measured by the government since 
the convertibility plan was introduced in April 1991. 
  Rents have gone up by a staggering 157.2 percent while 
doctors and dentists have increased their fees by up to 137 
percent. Hairdressers were not far behind as their rates have 
bounded skyward, bringing them up to 103 percent higher. 
  According to the UADE report domestic help has kept pace 
with 
this upward surge and is now an average 99.9 percent more 
expensive. 
  Most people, with their wages seemingly stuck to a very low 
floor, have been amazed to see the cost of entertainment bubble 
up and up. A ticket to a football match now costs 92 percent 
more than nearly three years ago, as do cinemas and theaters. 
  Also hitting the wage earner's pocket has been the cost of 
the midday meal, which has gone up by a belt-tightening 77 
percent since convertibility began. 
  Transport would appear to be the only service whose prices 
have gone up less than official amount for accumulated 
inflation. Short distance bus fares have increased 40 percent 
while the cost of a ticket on a commuter train has gone up by 
only 23 percent. 
  The UADE points out that the price rises in the last 12 
months have caused a drop in the industrial worker's purchasing 
power in most areas. Widespread clothing imports have made 
refurbishing ones wardrobe one of the few good deals around. 
Purchasing power in terms of clothing has improved by 10 percent.

<F P=106> [Article: "Seven Asymmetries"] </F>
  [Text] The Argentine Industrial Union (UIA) has asked the 
government to postpone the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
commercial integration program until 30 June 1994. The Union is 
seeking the six-month delay because of marked imbalances between 
the Argentine and Brazilian economies. "If protective measures 
are not taken," it warns, "Argentine productive activity will be 
totally replaced by Brazilian imports." 
<H5>  Seven Asymmetries </H5>
  Argentine manufacturers point to at least seven areas in 
which there are cost differences compared with their Brazilian 
counterparts. 
  These are the so-called "asymmetries," the euphemism used to 
avoid mention of something even more formidable: the advantages 
which Brazil extends to all manufacturers to help them penetrate 
the Argentine market. 
  The Argentine Industrial Union's missive spells out a few, 
while avoiding the mention of a source of irritation to Minister 
Domingo Cavallo: Nowhere is any reference made to the gap 
between the Argentine rate of exchange and the constant 
devaluation in Brazil. It merits only passing mention even 
though it is the favorite argument used by Itamar Franco's 
government to counter demands made by Argentine industry. 
  The UIA cites the following Brazilian economic factors that 
affect Argentine manufacturers: 
  1) the enormous difference in the cost of electric power, 
which the UIA believes has resulted from the failure to amortize 
government investments in the hydroelectric plants that generate 
over 90 percent of all electricity used in Brazil; 
  2) the extremely high rate of tax evasion, which Brazilian 
authorities put at a minimum of 55 percent; 
  3) competition between Brazil's states to attract 
investments 
by granting high tax exemptions to investment and production 
projects; 
  4) the lag in real wages; 
  5) financial benefits for exporters that charge the daily 
exchange rate while paying for consumable expenditures, 
services, raw materials, and personnel at the old rate; 
  6) the existence of subsidies in certain cases where raw 
materials are supplied by government-owned enterprises; and 
  7) long-term financing for sales of capital goods at very 
low 
interest rates. 
  For the first time, the association of Argentine businessmen 
has demanded officially that the government temporarily suspend 
all of the central issues of the integration treaty with Brazil. 
  The drastic and unusual request is included in a document in 
which the Argentine Industrial Union warns of a grave danger to 
the entire Argentine economy. It emphasizes that if special 
safeguards are not put in place, "productive activity will be 
totally replaced by Brazilian imports" in many manufacturing 
sectors. 
  Brandishing these dramatic arguments based on the manifest 
economic imbalances of Brazil and the productive disadvantages 
of our own national industry, the manufacturers are urgently 
demanding drastic measures to check the wave of Brazilian 
imports. 
  In other words, they are asking for time and do so in the 
following terms: "It is imperative that we draft necessary 
amendments or extend the transitional period provided for in the 
treaty, which essentially grants sufficient time so that our 
main Mercosur partner may make indispensable adjustments in 
order to coordinate its macroeconomic policies with the 
remaining countries." 
  The demands are included in a letter which the Argentine 
Industrial Union has sent to the head of the Ministry of Economy. 
  The five-page letter is dated 18 November and spells out the 
negative effects suffered by Argentine business. Jorge Blanco 
Villegas delivered the letter to Minister Domingo Cavallo in 
person. 
  It states textually that: "It is our view that the 
deep-rooted asymmetries currently existing between Argentina and 
Brazil and which are commercially favorable to the latter will 
increase immediately, aggravating the problems and harm suffered 
by many Argentine industries." 
  The manufacturers therefore ask that "play be halted" 
throughout the process of integration with Brazil. They are 
specifically asking for a general postponement lasting 
approximately six months. 
  They do so straightforwardly: "We propose to set a period 
ending on 30 June 1994 (rather than 31 December) in order to 
enable the countries involved to draw up new schedules for the 
Mercosur commercial liberalization and special lists." 
  In case any doubt should remain, they continue: "We also 
propose the date of 30 June 1994 for determining the common 
foreign tariff and new guidelines for sectorial agreements." 
  The following are among the urgent measures requested by the 
manufacturers' association: 
  1) temporary suspension of the commercial liberalization 
schedule, meaning that the deadline of the end of December would 
be removed; 
  2) temporary suspension of the reduction in the list of 
exceptions so that the 20 percent set for the end of this year 
would not take effect; 
  3) modification of the Las Lenas schedule to permit a fairer 
and more appropriate drafting of the common foreign tariff; and 
  4) a modification of current guidelines for sectorial 
agreements. 
  The manufacturers' association issued its strong demand in 
order to mediate the internal dispute raging in the government 
over Argentina's position vis-a-vis Brazil. 
  The Foreign Ministry intends to implement the agreement to 
the letter. Such is the gist of the position taken by Minister 
Guido Di Tella and Secretary Hector Gambarotta. In contrast, the 
Ministry of Economy is more sympathetic to problems caused by 
the invasion of imports because it throws the convertibility 
plan off balance. 
  In the letter, which is signed by top-ranking officials 
Jorge 
Blanco Villegas and Eduardo Faena, the Industrial Union paints a 
dark picture of the effects which integration will have on 
production if the government fails to take protective measures. 
  Those effects include the following: 
  Brazil's imports are replacing efficiently made local 
products. 
  Small and medium-size industries have curtailed their 
productive capacity because of the wave of imports. 
  Other manufacturing sectors have postponed and abandoned 
reconversion programs because of the commercial advantages of 
complementing sales with the same products imported from Brazil. 
  Tempted by temporary marketing advantages, some industrial 
sectors are totally replacing their production with imports, 
maintaining their share of the market and profits while gaining 
the added advantage of simplifying business. 
  All these difficulties stem from the unequal process of 
bilateral trade. Manufactured goods make up 90 percent of all 
purchases from Brazil. Argentina's exports of manufactured 
products comprise only about half (47 percent) of all goods sold 
and include agricultural products. 
  The UIA therefore emphasizes that the problems and ill 
effects suffered by many industrial sectors will be complicated 
as of 1 January and become even worse if no changes are made by 
the beginning of 1995. 
  The manufacturers argue that there is little time left and 
that a decision is urgent. They do not want to condemn Argentina 
to the role of supplying fuel and grain.

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" of interview with President Fidel Castro by </F>
unidentified reporters in Santiago de Cuba on 1 January -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] I am from Santiago de Cuba and I, like my 
people, recently experienced the same difficult times other 
eastern provinces experienced. Have you been able to learn what 
is being done? What aid has the country received from the 
international community? 
  [Castro] Not much here in Santiago de Cuba. The country 
provided the money needed, especially to rebuild homes, repair 
mattresses, to give the people back what they lost, to purchase 
cement. Almost all has been done with money provided by the 
country. Much has been done in Guantanamo, the most affected 
province, Sagua, and Santiago. Guantanamo was strongly affected 
by the rains. Just imagine what it was like to have 700 
millimeters of rain fall on the area in 36 hours. This happened 
in one municipality. It was tremendous. If affected the 
coffee, tuber, and orchard crops. However, the storm of the 
century caused more damage than these rains. The storm of the 
century affected many provinces. However, this recent storm 
caused much damage in Guantanamo. It destroyed thousands of 
homes. 
  [Reporter] Years ago you made a speech at Cespedes Park. You 
said that there was much for the Revolution to do in the future. 
At that time, you said that the people had all their hopes set 
on the rebel army and on you. However, you told them you did 
not want to be a demagogue and admitted that difficult times lay 
ahead. A few minutes ago you repeated those words. 
  [Castro] When I entered Havana on 8 January, I stressed that 
even more. I warned the people that even more difficult times 
lay ahead. I told the people that. 
  [Reporter] And you have repeated those same words today. 
  [Castro] I did. Being a demagogue would be lying to the 
people. It would be a lie to tell the people that the problems 
are small and that the path ahead is an easy one to travel. 
  [Reporter] Comparing.... 
  [Castro, interrupts] We are enduring a test no other country 
has ever endured. We are the only country to endure it; it is a 
tremendous test. 
  [Reporter] In your opinion, [words indistinct] the 
Revolution? 
  [Castro] As if we were starting all over again. The 
struggle is much harder, but we have more people who are more 
revolutionary, more aware, better prepared. This revolutionary 
contingent must win this battle. It is better prepared and more 
aware. No other country in the world has waged a battle as 
difficult as the one Cuba has waged. We have been resisting the 
empire for the past 35 years. That is an unheard of prowess. We 
do not really realize what this has meant, what victoriously 
resisting the United States for the past 35 years has meant. 
The United States is trying to take advantage, 
opportunistically take advantage of the fact that the socialist 
bloc has disappeared. The most extraordinary thing is that 
despite the disappearance of the socialist bloc, we continue to 
challenge the United States and continue to wage our battle. 
This is a first in the history of Cuba. I have no doubts that 
this generation is waging the most difficult and most heroic 
battle in Cuba's history. You, all of you, are waging this 
battle. 
  [Reporter] Tell us how you spent the last day of the year. 
  [Castro] I spent the last day of the year meditating a bit 
about today's event. I rested. I rested on the last day of the 
year. It was a hectic and tiring month; I was tired. I knew 
that I had to be here today, that I had to come here today. I 
spent almost the whole day reading, but I was reading about 
other things. I read about economics and international matters. 
I also read a bit of fiction. What I did was rest. At 
midnight I went to visit some friends.

  [Text] To defend the whole truth about Cuba is the 
equivalent of protecting the sovereignty and independence of 
Latin America. This has been stated by Cuban Ambassador to 
Brazil Jorge Bolanos in an article published by JOURNAL DO 
BRASIL, entitled "The Truth About Cuba." Bolanos denounces the 
fact that the CIA, just days ago, once again issued apocalyptic 
reports about Cuba. He stressed that it is not the first time 
that the CIA has done something like this against Cuba. He gives 
as an example the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and the 
predictions about of the fall of the Revolution, which is today 
more solid than ever.

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Ariel Larramendi] </F>
  [Text] The year is coming to a close and according to 
political and government leaders: This has been the most 
dangerous and difficult year we have ever faced in the history 
of the Revolution. I think, and this is my personal opinion, 
that the new year will not fail to be tense, dangerous at times, 
and full of difficulties. However, we observe its arrival, 
having gained something like a special-period culture. We sense 
or know what are the traumatic aspects of the complex picture 
ahead and, above all, see our goal more clearly. However, we 
still have to more clearly define the paths to reach that goal. 
  The deadlines set by the power centers of the empire for the 
collapse of the Cuban project have passed. Here we are. The 
country has not become an anarchy, nor have centrifugal forces 
prevailed. What prevailed is political tradition in the face of 
so many highly diverse factors of disintegration; those having 
to do with our economic ties abroad are already known, and those 
generated by the domestic economic crisis we had to face. 
However, here we are. 
  One of the challenges that I see in the new year is that of 
participation, either that of labor groups in the management of 
enterprises or that of citizens in general in the People's 
Government bodies. Anyway, what is taking place in Cuba is a 
participatory democracy. I believe that previously, the 
participation of diverse sectors of the population in the 
decision-making process was somewhat detached due to the state's 
basically paternalistic, vertical relationship, which limited 
the participation of the people in the process of defining and 
solving problems. 
  What is being advocated now is basically a different 
participation. The Cuban people need a readjustment of the 
so-called pattern of accumulation, based on higher levels of 
efficiency and the intensive use of our human and material 
resources. In order to achieve this qualitative leap, the Cuban 
people must increase their participation in a more conflicting 
stage, and free of the state's paternalism. The state itself is 
relinquishing its role as regulator in certain economic fields 
and at the same time, the people's autonomy is increasing while 
becoming more complex as the result of new ideas and performers 
in the life of the country. This process, which is already 
taking place and will continue to develop in the future, is 
supported by a certain experience and knowledge. Nothing will 
startle us. We will be here.

<F P=106> [Straight Talk program, hosted by Juan Carlos Roque Garcia] </F>
  [Text] [Garcia] Greetings friends. Here is another edition 
of "Straight Talk" today, Tuesday [21 December], this time from 
Santiago de Cuba Province -- specifically, from the Radio 
Rebelde studios here in Santiago de Cuba Province. 
  With us are journalists Dania Sanchez Parra of the National 
News Agency [AIN]; Mario Romaguera, a reporter from the SIERRA 
MAESTRA newspaper; and Carlos Sanabria Marrero, a Radio Rebelde 
journalist here in Santiago de Cuba. The topic: speculation and 
the theft of food products. And, like we promised, as of today 
we will refer to the letters of several listeners. 
  We begin with a letter from Ramon Sarmont Martinez who lives 
here in Santiago de Cuba. He specifies that the people who steal 
big quantities do not do it because they are hungry. They do it 
because they want to get their hands on thousands of pesos in 
just a few days. He adds: Nor will we side with those who reach 
agreements with the people in the small produce markets to later 
sell the sacks of potatoes, boniato, or yuca on the black 
market. We know that there is a big tangled mess behind all 
this. Meanwhile, other small produce markets are empty. 
  The discussion is now open, here on the Straight Talk 
program, in Santiago de Cuba. Carlos Sanabria Marrero. 
  [Sanabria] Well, I think this listener from Santiago de Cuba 
is very correct in what he has said to the Straight Talk 
program. I think, Juan Carlos, that indeed the products, mainly 
agricultural, are lost and diverted from the very moment they 
come out of the fields, off the farm, and during the moving of 
the products by the State Collection Enterprise from the fields 
to the central warehouse. From that point, there is another 
redistribution to the different markets by cart, as it is being 
done here in Santiago de Cuba. 
  During that whole process the products are being diverted. 
Logically, one market could be affected more than another, and 
then there is this resale at exorbitant prices which hurts and 
irritates the population. One could even encounter a situation 
where when one gets to the market the staples that correspond to 
one's needs are lacking. Where did these products end up? Who 
took it? It was not the consumers, but the people involved in 
this task and many administrators, as this listener has stated. 
  [Roque] Listener, Ruben Sarmont Martinez presents a 
situation 
that could be seen from Santiago de Cuba's particular point of 
view. But I must say that is something that happens throughout 
the country. It is a situation that repeats itself in the other 
provinces. Nevertheless, from this letter, we can see the 
problems that exist due to the speculation on and theft of food 
products. 
  Dania Sanchez Parra from AIN is here with us in Santiago de 
Cuba Province. 
  [Sanchez] Yes Roque, I agree with this listener. He said 
that 
most of these thefts do not respond to a true need of the person 
who commits the crime. It is greed and the desire to get rich 
quick. I would like to focus on something Sanabria said: This is 
a chain. The chain begins from the source of these products or 
their arrival at the port, through the distribution network, 
until it reaches the market. This greatly damages the economy. 
It is a great loss. The losses are not as few as they appear. It 
is a chain and each link's role is very important. 
  [Roque] Analyzing this, we could probably conclude that on 
one hand you have theft, but what are the causes? Hunger? There 
also is a lack of control. There also is negligence by the 
responsible authorities. We are going to continue discussing 
this topic here on Straight Talk, directly from Santiago de Cuba. 
  [Roque] Our guests on this occasion are Dania Sanchez 
Parra, from AIN; Mario Romaguera, a reporter from the SIERRA 
MAESTRA newspaper; and Carlos Sanabria Marrero, a reporter from 
Radio Rebelde here in Santiago de Cuba. 
  We continue with our debate: Speculation and the theft of 
food products. Mario Romaguera. 
  [Romaguera] I agree with the listener in all his points. I 
have experience in this area as a reporter. On several 
occasions, I have denounced the sale of food products in 
Santiago de Cuba, products that are produced by local 
industries, such as bread, sausages, marmalade, and a series of 
other products. These activities go on the streets of Santiago 
de Cuba in the area of Central Street between Street No. 4 and 
the bus station. This area includes two areas with a large flow 
of people in addition to people going to the provincial hospital 
and the maternity hospital. 
  [Roque] Carlos Sanabria Marrero, we were analyzing the 
causes, but we must also find, as I said, the reason why these 
acts take place. Why is there speculation? Is it just because of 
necessity? 
  [Sanabria] I do not think it is just necessity. There are 
many people, as the listeners have pointed out, that do not need 
to steal or speculate. They do it to get rich and, logically, 
because the consumer wants the product. 
  Everyone knows the situation our country is currently going 
through. I reiterate, I believe the main responsibility lies on 
those people responsible for making sure these situations do not 
occur. These products do not have difficulties while they are in 
storage. The difficulties begin once those products leave the 
warehouse. We need to make sure those products are reaching 
their final destination. 
  We can see this in the situation of the State Collection 
Agency. Since there still is no control, no one can verify that 
the products reach their final destination, instead of being 
diverted and reaching destinations they should not reach. That 
is where these difficulties come from, problems that irritate 
the population. When someone tells you that you have to pay 5 
pesos for a plantain, which he probably stole from the state, 
you will probably buy it because of need, but undoubtedly it 
will end up affecting you, your family, and the country's 
economy. 
  [Roque] This is a topic that has many angles. Listener Maria 
Geudes Alfonso writes to us: In my opinion, theft and fraud in 
the sale of products to the population are not just seen on 
streets and on the black market; it originates in the stores, 
markets, and restaurants. She adds: I do not wish to be 
specific, but I think it is necessary that you analyze and talk 
about this topic so that these shameful things that victimize 
the consumer and force him to bear and put up with this are 
known. 
  We will hear from Dania Sanchez Parra from AIN. 
  [Sanchez] Yes, when merchandise arrives at its first 
reception point, before reaching the distribution network, it is 
already on the black market and there are already possibilities 
of obtaining it--before the state has made it available to the 
population. Other factors are negligence and lack of control, 
evils greatly affecting our economy. 
  [Roque] How do we combat this? I am sure this is a question 
that many listeners are asking. Mario Romaguera. 
  [Romaguera] Juan Carlos, it is evident that the first thing 
we need is a truly serious corps of inspectors. It is clear that 
we need a truly serious corps of inspectors. 
  [Roque] It would be another corps of inspectors, right? 
  [Romaguera] Yes, another one. 
  [Roque] When are we going to assign this new group? We have 
placed inspectors in different areas of the food industry, 
agriculture, the collection area, and the whole system, and we 
still do not have the results we want because these products are 
still being sold on the black market. This irritates the 
population who purchase these products out of need. I think it 
is time to take other measures if we see that the current ones 
do not have good results. 
  [Romaguera] Another solution could be the immediate 
expulsion of those inspectors who allow this to happen and the 
expulsion of those administrators and workers who divert the 
goods. I must state that not all workers are bandits who divert 
resources. There is a network of workers who commit these 
violations. I say violations, to use a kinder word. 
  [Roque] We must find a solution. It is evident that this 
problem cannot continue, especially today when the special 
period is sharp, with the situation at the end of the year, and 
the situation of the new year. It is very difficult. No one can 
make predictions, but we are approaching very difficult times 
and we must face this. How can we face this situation? Dania 
could you please comment on this. 
  [Sanchez] I do not think the solution is to create new 
mechanisms, because we already have many mechanisms. 
  [Roque] Too many. 
  [Sanchez] Yes, many. I would talk about being demanding of 
those mechanisms, because as you can see we have too many. We 
are talking about administrators and distributors. We are 
talking about the role of the inspectors and the receiving 
units, and I believe there still is much more to be said. I 
would also say that we need more social action. Everyone has a 
great responsibility. This task belongs to each member of our 
society, and it is important that each link of this chain does 
its part harmoniously. 
  [Roque] This is an important point, because in this struggle 
against speculation and theft the people are the main players. 
It is the people who must face the situation. 
  [Romaguera] Juan Carlos, people need support. They must be 
helped. I will give you an example. Many times hamburgers are 
sold without bread. Then some quack appears on the street -- 
and this is something I have seen for myself in Calvario in 
front of the Santiago de Cuba funeral home -- screaming or 
chanting: I have hamburgers with bread. Where did he get the 
bread, especially when the bread used for hamburgers is a 
special type. How did he get that bread. This is something the 
SIERRA MAESTRA newspaper has been denouncing in reports I have 
written, as well as by reporters like Rafael Carela and Jose 
Ignate. Action needs to be taken in this sense. 
  [Sanabria] I agree with what you and Dania have stated. I 
believe a raid should be carried out block by block, where every 
person knows who is who, where the presidents of the Committees 
for the Defense of the Revolution [CDR] knows everyone, where 
the CDR president's neighbor knows his neighbor. I believe that 
if we combat this from the very base, many of these problems 
could be eliminated. I believe the battle has to be fought block 
by block, because when the people fight the battle we win. 
  [Roque] Dania, we have 30 seconds left in the program. 
  [Sanchez] Roque, it is not going to be these actions that 
are 
going to solve this problem. It will be the systematic efforts 
and the awareness that we cannot build socialism that way. 
  [Roque] This has been Straight Talk from Santiago de Cuba. 
The topic has been: speculation and theft of food products. I 
thank Dania Sanchez Parra, from AIN; Mario Romaguera, from the 
SIERRA MAESTRA newspaper; and our journalist Carlos Sanabria 
Marrero, here in the Radio Rebelde studio in Santiago de Cuba.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 24 December and 4 
January. 
  Radio Reloj at 2045 GMT on 24 December reports that Granma 
Province met its coffee production goal for the present 
campaign, representing a 15-percent increase over the same 
period, 1992. 
  Radio Reloj at 2050 GMT on 24 December reports that the 
Austrian "Sun Over Cuba" solidarity group sent a donation 
consisting of a computer, school materials, and medicine. The 
donations will be distributed to the Camilo Cienfuegos School 
and the Rafael Freire Hospital in Holguin. The computer will be 
sent to the Institute of Solar Energy. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 27 December reports that Royal, 
a Canadian company, has joined the airlines that bring tourists 
from Toronto, Canada, to Ciego de Avila, Royal is scheduled to 
fly to Ciego de Avila and Camaguey on a weekly basis. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 3 January reports that Villa 
Clara Province has attained an infant morality rate for 1993 of 
6.6 per 1,000 live births. 
  Radio Reloj at 2043 GMT on 3 January reports that Maria 
Lucia 
Ruiz, Havana tour manager in Colombia, last night greeted the 
first charter flight of Colombian tourists to Varadero. On 9 
January, a charter flight from Colombia is to arrive in Cuba. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 4 January reports that railway 
service between Guantanamo Province and the rest of the nation 
has been restored. Eighty percent of the merchandise going to 
Guantanamo Province is moved by rail. 
  The same newscast reports that the Caribe Navigation 
Enterprise on the Isle of Youth has announced that the number of 
passenger trips by motorboat between Nueva Gerona and Batabano 
will be reduced this month because of a lack of spare parts: As 
of 10 January, there will be two rather than three departures. 
In order to make up for this reduction in the current 
transportation program, ships will also depart on Mondays, 
Wednesdays, and Fridays and return on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and 
Sundays. "In order to achieve this increase, the ferry Isla de 
la Juventude, which can carry more than 500 passengers, will be 
rendered operative." 
  Radio Rebelde further announces that Matanzas oil workers 
extracted 814,000 tons of oil in 1993, "which was 81 percent of 
the program for the period, at the same time setting a national 
record for crude oil production." Officials of the oil 
extraction enterprise of Central Cuba said that of a potential 
21 million cubic meters of natural gas, just over 15.5 million 
cubic meters were used, "which shows that the demand for this 
fuel is still low. Despite failure to fulfill the investment 
programs, difficulties with the system for moving crude oil 
along the coast by ship, and scarce resources, this enterprise 
-- which produced the greatest amount of oil in Cuba -- showed 
an increase in drilling last year, with 15,500 meters. There are 
currently 180 wells in the largest oil deposit yet discovered in 
Cuba. Exploration continues in that zone with a view to 
increasing its potential and extracting higher- quality oil. 
  Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 4 January reports that Cuban 
oil workers hope to extract 1.2 million tons of crude in 1994. 
There are also plans to increase seismic research in 1994 with a 
view to improving exploration; Cuba hopes to have a much 
stronger investments program and to begin drilling all over the 
country. "Four new sites, located in the traditional petroleum 
areas, also will be opened." 
  In the same newscast, Progreso's Sanciti Spiritus 
correspondent reports that the industrial gases factory in 
Sancti Spiritus has begun making chalk for use in Cuba's 
schools. The plant engineer notes that most of the chalk in Cuba 
used to be imported from China and that the chalk being produced 
in Cuba now is "almost of better quality than the Chinese chalk." 
  Radio Rebelde Network at 1255 GMT on 4 January reports that 
Granma Province sugar sector workers have fulfilled the 
cold-season cane planting plan. They planted almost 437 
caballerias; and 10 of the 11 sugar industry complexes met their 
commitments. Also, "Havana farmers made a big effort in December 
to catch up as regards the cold-season planting, and they began 
1994 with close to 1,500 caballerias planted in tubers and 
vegetables, which will guarantee the program for February." 
  Radio Rebelde Network at 1800 GMT on 4 January reports that 
the "La Victoria de Giron" citrus-producing complex, the largest 
in the nation, managed to stop the decline in its plantations by 
the end of 1993 by establishing cooperation in production that 
facilitated credits for buying fuel and agricultural inputs. 
This allowed the recovery of approximately 20,000 hectares, 
which constitute over 50 percent of the complex's lands. In 1993 
the complex produced over 7 million quintals of citrus fruits. 
  In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that 359 high-voltage 
transformers were recovered in Ciego de Avila Province in 1993. 
"The work team that specializes in the recovery of that kind of 
equipment is currently working on rewinding and adapting a group 
of 160-kilovolt Italian transformers that will be set up at 
sugar-production complexes in Ciego de Avila and Sancti Spiritus 
for the current harvest." 
  In the same cast, Rebelde also reports that a new type of 
materials-efficient floor tile, sometimes called "the 
streamlined tile", has been developed by the Construction 
Materials Enterprise of Sancti Spiritus. Production of this tile 
allows for practically doubling the amount of surface that can 
be tiled using the same amount of raw materials. The tile is 
made with scrap residue from the sugar mills in place of silica 
and powdered stone. Because of its light weight, this tile also 
is easier to transport and to lay.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] The 3 January editorial of the newspaper 
TRABAJADORES points out that the currency excess, caused mainly 
by the continuous, growing budget deficit, is today the Cuban 
family's main worry. The article adds that the sudden weakening 
of the Cuban economy from external factors has been reflected in 
a drop in individual consumption and the loss of the purchasing 
power of salaries which, in many cases, are partially alloted to 
buying on the black market, where they are also losing value due 
to an increase in prices. Upon the collapse of our import 
capability, production dropped in a descending spiral while the 
peoples' salaries and state expenses remain more or less stable, 
thus weakening financial balance and the motivational aspect of 
salaries. 
  The time has come to begin putting order into domestic 
finances and directing the people's efforts toward a harmony 
between state expenses and income, while implementing actions to 
reduce the excess currency in circulation. As always in our 
society, the workers are the ones who can contribute most to 
solving these urgent problems because no measure or series of 
measures could hope to succeed unless it has the workers' 
support. We are convinced that the measures should be taken 
slowly, not only because of their technical complexity and the 
need to understand the problems more deeply, but also because 
they should be the future basis of a true national consensus 
without losing track of the Cuban nation's foundation of social 
justice. 
  The TRABAJADORES editorial stresses that while we are 
grateful for the serene, democratic speed of the decision-taking 
process, we are calling all workers and union movements to 
action because much can already be done to promote financial 
balance and to fight the causes and consequences of imbalance. 
First of all, we have to preserve the value of work. The 
editorial adds that as Commander in Chief Fidel Castro has 
repeated, Cuban workers are demonstrating the value of honor and 
revolutionary and patriotic awareness as they challenge, day to 
day, all kinds of difficulties in fulfilling their labor tasks. 
  It is unquestionable that the immense majority of Cuban 
workers have placed their commitment and honor above the 
material factors that affect work motivation under the present 
circumstances. Let us maintain and improve discipline and the 
commitment to do more with the available resources in every work 
center. This will be an immense contribution to the solution of 
the financial problem, which in the end will be solved through 
more production and work. Let us fight everywhere the absurd 
habit of spending certain allocations unjustifiably just to 
ensure a similar allocation in the next budget cycle. Let us 
reject, with renewed energy, inefficient work, particularly 
where there is a sure capacity to produce. 
  In a proletariat society, the state develops and manages the 
budget with the same principles that a united family manages its 
own budget. The editorial adds that there is no sacrifice that 
is not good for everyone when it ensures the wellbeing of all. 
It adds: just as a family cannot nor ought to spend more than it 
earns, our state is also compelled to follow that strict 
economic logic. Presumably, the path to financial order and 
discipline will not be short nor easy, but everything being done 
will help us during hard times, and will better prepare us to 
accept any positive events that will result as the unavoidable 
reward of so much effort.
