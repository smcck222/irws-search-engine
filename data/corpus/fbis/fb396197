  [Text] Good evening, Radio Rebelde listeners. The efforts 
that the trade union movement can make to contribute to the 
development of Cuban foreign policy was stressed by Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina at a meeting of the Cuban Workers 
Federation [CTC] National Secretariat held today in Havana. 
Foreign Minister Robaina said that when Cubans visit other 
countries they become worthy representatives of the country's 
foreign policy and can talk about the situation experienced by 
the island. During his meeting with high- ranking CTC leaders, 
Robaina also broached other topics related to the ministry he 
heads and to the excellent displays of world solidarity with 
Cuba. Regarding diplomatic relations with Latin America and the 
Caribbean, Robaina said that these are very good and that there 
are plans to consolidate them even further. 
  During the CTC National Secretariat meeting, CTC Secretary 
General Pedro Ross Leal said that it is necessary for every 
union leader to discuss and analyze the current situation with 
the workers. He said that the union leaders should strengthen 
his ties with the workers. Ross Leal said that it is 
indispensable for all union leaders to find out how the workers 
feel about the current problems and to explain and clarify these 
for them, thus avoiding uncertainties. The CTC leader said that 
the union leaders must be aware of problems at the centers and 
try to solve them without waiting for directions.

  [Text] Colombian Public Health Minister Juan Luis Londono 
de la Cuesta is currently visiting Cuba. The minister and the 
delegation accompanying him will visit approximately eight 
health and research centers. Minister Londono today met with 
the Cuban Public Health Ministry directorate and Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina. Public Health Minister Londono told 
this newscast that his visit to Cuba is to: 
  [Begin Londono recording] Try to find channels for 
commercial 
trade that will allow us to improve our commercial relations 
between Colombia and Cuba and take advantage of the outstanding 
work you have developed in the field of health. We are going to 
try and gain knowledge of your contribution in the fields of 
pharmaceuticals, primary health care, and hospital care. We are 
trying to learn more and take advantage of the experience you 
have in these areas. [end recording] 
  Minister Londono also talked about the public health 
situation in Colombia. 
  [Begin Londono recording] In Colombia we have several 
problems. Perhaps the most important achievement is our 
reduction in the morbidity and mortality rate in transmitted 
diseases which are typical because of the poverty. We have been 
able to reduce these diseases considerably in the past 15 years. 
However, we are now, unfortunately, being affected by the 
trauma of violence in the country. More people are getting 
killed in Colombia than in any other country of the world. Not 
only are more people getting killed but the hospitals are 
constantly treating more and more wounded people. This has 
completely changed [words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  Minister Juan Luis Londono and the delegation accompanying 
him will return to Colombia on 11 January.

  [Text] Pinar del Rio workers expect good results from the 
efforts of the Revolutionary Armed Forces in the tomato harvest. 
The more than 1,500 soldiers of the Western Army that have 
participated to date in agrarian work in Los Palacios complex 
have demonstrated once more that with organization and 
discipline results are marked by efficiency. The chiefs, 
soldiers, cadets, Camilitos, and civilian workers that since 2 
November have been tackling the tomato campaign have attained a 
production per weight cost of less than 30 cents. 
  Colonel Arcangel Gonzalez Esteves, chief of the military 
unit 
35th Anniversary of the Revolution, explained that at the peak 
of the harvest -- February and March -- there will be over 2,000 
members of the Western Army in the fields in Vuelta Abajo. By 
then, the total number of participants in the entire 
mobilization campaign will have been more than 5,000 men and 
women.

  [Text] We will be faithful in relaying to our membership 
the trust Cuban workers have in their leaders. This has been 
stated by the members of the first two Japanese delegations to 
visit Cuba as part of the Union Tourism program. They showed 
great respect and admiration for the attitude of the Cuban 
people in resisting and overcoming the U.S. blockade. The 
visitors belong to the provincial and municipal unions of the 
governments of (Tokaona), (Logano), (Tuyana), and Hiroshima and 
the public workers organization of Tokyo's administration. The 
Japanese delegations were received by Norma Ortega, secretary 
general of Cuba's Public Administration Union. The Japanese 
delegations made cash donations for the Cuban people. Both 
Japanese organizations showed interest in the current situation 
of Cuba, and stressed the advantage that it is to live under the 
social justice existing in Cuba.

<F P=106> [Article by Alberto Pepe Leira] </F>
  [Text] Montevideo, 1 Jan (EFE) -- In an interview granted 
to EFE, during which he analyzed the 45 months of his government 
and the local and international situation, Uruguayan President 
Luis Alberto Lacalle stated that Europe is heading toward a not 
very bright future, a period "very similar to that of 1930, 
closed and with a sense of xenophobia." 
  He also expressed his optimism over the possibility of 
overcoming the common import tariff obstacle within Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South] and the implementation of the 
integration process among his country, Argentina, Brazil, and 
Paraguay as of 1995. 
  Lacalle attributed the inadequate results of the Uruguay 
Round of the GATT (General Agreement on Trade and Tariff) talks 
to the protectionist measures imposed by Europe, while locally 
he discarded the representative nature of the Chamber of 
Industries and the main union central, which is controlled by 
the left, which have joined forces to criticize and pressure his 
government. 
  According to the Uruguayan president today's world is quite 
different from the one that existed when the Uruguay Round was 
created in Punta del Este in 1986. 
  He said: "Copernican changes had taken place, and the 
impetus given by Uruguay at the proper time was very important, 
as there were times of optimism and of development in the most 
important economies, with the purpose of making trade more 
sustainable." 
  He added: "Today we are facing a very recessive Europe, 
which has prevented the Uruguay Round from acting in a more 
positive manner in the world economy." 
  Lacalle was more optimistic within the South American 
framework, and said that Mercosur will finally be consolidated. 
  "We have one obstacle left to overcome -- the common import 
tariff -- and with a little bit of realism we will be able to 
come to a decision according to the countries' interests. I 
think we have achieved a lot within Mercosur, and must not 
forget that we have been working on it for only three years," he 
said. 
  Lacalle added: "Intrazonal trade has multiplied, and in our 
country it has been the great shakeup causing many people to 
start thinking of the future and of investing. I already 
consider it a success, and hope that when we presidents meet we 
will be able to make a similar judgment." 
  Concerning reactions against his government by industrial 
businessmen and union leaders, he said "they startle me," 
because we have reached the lowest historical level of 
unemployment and the highest level of investment in the past 20 
years. 
  Lacalle said he considers very important "the 15 percent 
economic growth of the gross domestic product in this stage of 
government action." 
  He stressed the continuous drop in the unemployment rate, 
which in 1993 had an average rate of 8.4 percent, the greatest 
drop since 1981. 
  "Unemployment has been reduced, and therefore if it were not 
allied to political interests, the union organization PIT-CNT 
[Interunion Workers Plenum-National Workers Convention] would 
have been saying that this employment policy is best for 
workers," he said. 
  He said that "in Spanish terms we would say that a policy 
that reduces strikes must be praised by the union organizations, 
but we all know that we are in a somewhat peculiar country, and 
I have no doubt there are obvious political intentions on the 
part of the PIT-CNT which do not represent the majority of 
Uruguayan workers." 
  Concerning the Chamber of Industries, Lacalle said that it 
does "represent some industries, because I know other 
businessmen who tell us that the sooner we accelerate the 
opening process the better." 
  The Uruguayan president added: "I therefore see that in the 
exercise of liberty which is so valuable for us, we have 
opinions which I do not believe to be the exact expression of 
the large sectors which they are said to represent." 
  "The results of the last 45 months are emerging in a 
positive 
light, because what we had seen before from the government is 
now being seen by the people as part of a consistent, clear, and 
stable economic policy," he said. 
  Lacalle insisted that his government practices "social 
liberalism" despite its policies being characterized as 
"neoliberal," which is traditionally understood as "opposite or 
at least contradictory to social-oriented policies." 
  "However, the arrangement of finances and of the deficit, 
the 
foreign debt renegotiation, and fiscal prudence have gone hand 
to hand with a doubling in budget resources assigned to 
education and health," he said. 
  He added that despite having a minority in Congress, and 
having organized a plebiscite against the partial privatization 
of state companies, his policy "has brought, to the extent 
possible, a considerable improvement in public finances and 
administration." 
  "Taking into consideration all these problems, the results 
appear to be much brighter because they are obtained in the 
midst of great difficulties," he said. 
  Lacalle expects that 1994 "will not be a year off because it 
is an electoral year, as three months are more than enough for 
an electoral campaign." 
  According to the president the executive branch will send to 
Congress important initiatives, and he expects their approval 
"in a year which has no reason to be unproductive."

  [Excerpt] Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia stated: "If 
abusing the right to veto means resorting to this institutional 
tool as many times as is deemed convenient, then I think the 
executive branch is going to abuse it, but only to the extent 
that Congress, too, abuses its powers." 
  The secretary of state also noted that the military law is 
flagrantly unconstitutional, as is the Council of Magistrates 
Law and radio broadcasting law, and added that the veto is 
democracy's natural mechanism to submit a difference of criteria 
or legal interpretation to a third state power. [passage

  [Excerpt] Referring to reiterated comments by President 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy on the obstructive attitude of the 
legislative branch, Second Senate Vice President Basilio 
Nikiphoroff said: "The president of the Republic, through these 
new attacks, seems to be taking preliminary steps to close 
Congress." 
  During a recent visit to Alto Parana Department, President 
Wasmosy had stated that Congress seeks to hinder the democratic 
process and to affect the dignity and honor of the Armed Forces. 
  The National Encounter senator added: "Frankly I do not 
understand this criticism because Congress has expeditiously 
debated 90 percent of the draft bills in a coordinated manner 
and approved all the requests for credits submitted to us; I 
honestly do not understand this attitude." 
  Nikiphoroff also criticized the executive branch's 
successive 
vetoes considering that in six months it vetoed seven draft 
bills that had been approved by Congress. Nikiphoroff said: 
"The president vetoes everything; however, we are not doing the 
same." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The persistent aggressive language used by some 
executive branch members against Congress reveals a lack of 
understanding of the process we are undergoing. This was stated 
by [National Encounter] Senator Diego Abente, who thus referred 
to the defense minister's comment that the president of the 
Republic will continue to make "abusive" use of his right to 
veto laws. 
  Sen. Abente said: "The veto is a constitutional tool that 
must be used moderately and with prudence. It may not be used 
only when the executive branch deems a draft bill 
unconstitutional." 
  Throughout history, this tool has been used in the world 
when 
the executive branch and congress' interpretations differ on how 
to solve a specific problem. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Executive Branch has vetoed seven laws 
generated in Congress but, on the other hand, it has not 
submitted a single draft bill on its economic and social plans 
to Congress. The declared war between the two state branches is 
placing the implementation of basic laws for the state's legal 
regulation at stake. 
  The Executive Branch's declared war against Congress, which 
is reflected in the veto of laws of vital importance for the 
state's legal regulation, threatens to affect the country's 
political and economic panorama even more. 
  The Executive Branch, rather than proposing, has vetoed 
seven 
laws, of which two refer to social issues (expropriation of 
land), one is socio-economic nature (the rescheduling of small 
farmers' debts to the CAH [Agricultural Development Fund]), one 
related to the prison system, the radio broadcasting law, and, 
last, three of a political nature, that is, the Military 
Organization Law, the law banning soldiers and police from 
political party affiliation, as well as the Council for 
Magistrates (that the Executive Branch still has not vetoed but 
has threatened to do so.) [figures as published] 
  Due to its conflict with Congress, the Executive Branch 
seems 
to have exhausted its power to generate draft bills. In the 
economic field, for example, it has not submitted a single draft 
bill for the rationalization of its public expenditures.

  [Excerpts] Asked about the impact on the members of the 
Armed Forces of having a civilian as their commander in chief, 
General Lino Cesar Oviedo said: "If we remain within that 
command, it is because we are happy and content; otherwise we 
would ask for retirement." 
  Gen. Oviedo, who is the Army commander, pointed out that an 
officer who is part of the organization (referring to the Armed 
Forces) accepts being there because he is satisfied and content. 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked if he continues firm in his loyalty to President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy, Oviedo said that should be taken for granted. 
  Oviedo added: "If we are under his command, we have no other 
alternative. All those under his command are loyal to him. The 
rules of the game ask for absolute loyalty, respect for the 
Constitution and the laws." [passage omitted]

  [Text] An unexpected change has taken place in Antelco 
[National Telecommunications Administration]. According to 
Decree No. 1834, engineer Miguel Horacio Gini Espinola was 
appointed today as Antelco board of directors chairman, 
replacing Colonel Eduardo Yasuo Kishi Ichikawa, a general staff 
school graduate, who tendered his resignation from the post. 
  As a matter of fact, these changes within Antelco further 
aggravated the already tense relations between President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy and [Colorado Party President] Blas N. Riquelme. 
  It was reported that the Colorado Party president challenged 
the removal of his brother-in-law, Jose Luis Yanez, from the 
Antelco board of directors. 
  It was reported that Colorado Party President Blas N. 
Riquelme went to Government Palace to visit the president of the 
Republic, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and to challenge the removal of 
his brother-in- law, Jose Luis Yanez, from the Antelco board of 
directors. 
  This is the first time that I have left worried after an 
audience with the president of the Republic, the Colorado Party 
leader said. 
  [Begin recording] [Riquelme] We will discuss it. I will 
hold a news conference at the appropriate time. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What did the president tell you? 
  [Riquelme] No. I am telling you that I left worried. 
  [Reporter] Would you resign? 
  [Riquelme] Within the next few hours I will know what I will 
do (?to be able to) ... 
  [Indistinct questions by several unidentified reporters who 
speak at the same time] 
  [Riquelme] We will see. We will see. 
  [Reporter] Was your resignation requested? 
  [Riquelme] Thank you very much. No. That is all. 
  [Reporter] For party reasons? 
  [Riquelme] Party reasons. 
  [Reporter] Party issues? 
  [Riquelme] Party issues. 
  [Reporter] Was your resignation requested? Will you resign 
as party president? [end recording] 
  After talking with Riquelme at his residence, [Colorado 
Deputy] Ismael Echague explained the tense atmosphere and the 
concern over the tense relations between the president of the 
Republic and the Colorado Party president. 
  [Begin Echague recording] I am aware that there actually 
have been some setbacks. A request had been made, had been sent 
to the executive branch by the Colorado Party executive board 
president, Mr. Blas N. Riquelme. This request was not 
satisfactorily dispatched by the executive branch. Therefore, 
this caused the Colorado Party president's personal anger and 
prompted the drawing up of a communique that will be released 
within the next few hours. [end recording] 
  Nevertheless, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy stressed that 
there are no problems over the changes made at Antelco. He said 
he just exercised his constitutional rights to remove government 
officials and that his government is far from being dictatorial. 
  [Begin recording] [unidentified reporter] Blas N. said this. 
In his speech, he said ... 
  [Wasmosy, interrupting] That is his business. I just 
exercised my rights, to which a president is entitled. That's 
it. 
  [Reporter] What did you specifically do, Mr. President? 
  [Wasmosy] Nothing, gentlemen. 
  [Reporter] What was Mr. Blas N. Riquelme's attitude? 
  [Wasmosy] Ask him. 
  [Reporter] There has been talk that you removed his 
brother-in-law, Blas N. Riquelme's brother-in-law, Luis Yanez, 
Mr. Yanez. 
  [Wasmosy] Well now, I can do ...[changes thought] I believe 
I can reorganize all the organizations using my criterion. I am 
our country's administrator. 
  [Reporter] But Blas N. Riquelme asked you not to remove him. 
  [Wasmosy] Ask him. 
  [Reporter] Deputy Ismael Echague said a dictatorship is 
hatching at Government Palace. 
  [Wasmosy] This is Ismael Echague's business, miss. [laughs] 
The government is far from being dictatorial. Well now, 
good-bye. [end recording] 
  Concerning this issue, we must report that the news 
conference announced by Ismael Echague never materialized, 
although there have been successive meetings. A meeting is now 
being held at the Colorado Party president's house. Present at 
this meeting are other Colorado Party executive board members 
like Dr. Diogenes Martinez, Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, National 
Republican Association [ANR -- Colorado Party] legislators, and 
ANR grass-roots leaders. 
  Let's wait for developments.

Luis Catalino Gonzalez Rojas from the Armed Forces active 
service. His retirement had been agreed upon during a meeting

  [Text] Captains, lieutenants, sublieutenants, as well as 
NCO's and sergeants -- who were asked what effect the 
elimination of food rations will have on the income of 
lower-rank officers -- admitted that they will face difficulties 
because the bonus granted in exchange for the food supplies by 
no means covers the monthly food needs of an average family. 
  They added that this bonus will not cover many expenditures, 
and "we won't even by able to buy presents for Epiphany Day 
because we won't have any money." 
  They primarily blamed Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia for 
this situation because he has never strongly defended the 
position of the younger officers, and added that they will 
request his replacement "because he is no good for that job." 
  They added that the Armed Forces, as a whole, needs a 
minister who will speak up and equally defend them all and not 
somebody like Estigarribia, who only upholds the post of 
military forces commander held by Vice Admiral Eduardo Gonzalez 
Petit and tries to justify General Lino Oviedo's participation 
in politics by saying that soldiers cannot be deprived of 
partisan ideals. 
  They also recalled that as soon as it was published that 
Armed Forces members were annoyed about the elimination of food 
rations, National Police officers reacted immediately and warned 
the executive branch about the serious situation that might 
occur within the force if their food rations were eliminated. 
  The consulted officers, in the form of a protest, answered: 
"While the police complain, soldiers are afraid and are 
incapable of even defending their interests. No high-ranking 
officer has stood up for his NCO's or sergeants, who will be 
affected most, because they have money." 
  They also explained that they have to pay for their uniforms 
and transportation out of their meager salaries. They 
reiterated that their superiors do not pay heed to their demands 
and added that nobody dares speak up out of fear of possible 
reprisals. 
  They wondered why the police are allowed to voice their 
opinion while soldiers have precise orders not to speak publicly 
on subjects related to their profession. The affected soldiers 
said: "Neither Oviedo nor Gonzalez Petit gave us any 
explanations; they only addressed Christmas and New Year's 
messages as if that were enough."

  [Text] The U.S. Government denied an alleged summons to 
Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes 12 days ago for him to 
appear before the State Department in Washington. 
  A communique from the U.S. Embassy in Quito stated the 
meeting held by Undersecretary of State Alexander Watson and 
Foreign Minister Diego Paredes was requested by the Ecuadoran 
minister and not by a summons from the Washington official. 
Undersecretary Watson did not summon Foreign Minister Paredes, 
said the diplomatic communique which sought to end a controversy 
which, besides Paredes, involved President Sixto Duran-Ballen 
and former president Leon Febres-Cordero. 
  After newspapers reported Paredes' visit to Washington on 22 
and 23 December, Febres-Cordero said the objective of the visit 
was to heed a summons by the U.S. State Department and that he 
had firm evidence of the affair. The former president, who is 
the current mayor of Guayaquil, said Paredes was warned that 
U.S. aid could be suspended if a dictatorship was established in 
Ecuador. 
  Paredes contradicted the former president and asked him to 
present evidence to support his assertion and Duran-Ballen, 
after confirming his foreign minister's statements, asserted the 
whole affair was an idiocy produced by a sick mind. 
  Today Febres-Cordero complained about the adjectives and 
said 
Paredes' trip was suspicious, untimely, and inexplicable and 
said Duran-Ballen does not know what happens around him, 
including the field of foreign relations. 
  During an interview in Guayaquil, Duran-Ballen said: I rule 
the country in accordance with the Constitution and do not need 
to request permission from any country with regard to the 
actions I must undertake within the country or in foreign 
relations. 
  On Monday afternoon, the U.S. Embassy clarified the origin 
of 
the Paredes-Watson meeting which, according to the Ecuadoran 
foreign minister's version, was requested by him to review 
topics regarding bilateral relations. 
  According to former president Febres-Cordero's version, 
during the meeting Paredes was reprimanded for a supposed 
refusal of the Ecuadoran Government to execute the decisions 
made by Congress, thus, establishing a dictatorship.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 4 Jan (DPA) -- 
The Mexican "zapatist" guerrillas who spectacularly began a 
conflict in the southern State of Chiapas on 1 January plan a 
long-term war to "exterminate capitalism and institute 
socialism." 
  "We do not just want a change of government, we want to 
exterminate the capitalist system and establish socialism as 
many other countries have. We will not lay down our weapons for 
any reason," said one of the commanders near the occupied area 
of Ocosingo and Altamirano. 
  The so-called "Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN)," 
which took its name from the legendary peasant guerrilla leader 
Emiliano Zapata of the armed revolution of 1910-17, began on 1 
January by occupying four important municipal capitals of 
Chiapas State, one of Mexico's poorest and most underdeveloped 
states. "We had waited many years for solutions to our 
problems, many years of poverty and ignorance, and that is why 
we decided to go to war," said the rebel commander who 
identified himself simply as "Captain" of the EZLN, during a 
conversation with journalists at one of the rebel road blocks on 
the San Cristobal-Ocosingo road. 
  The insurgents first occupied San Cristobal de las Casas, 
Las 
Margaritas, Ocosingo, and Altamirano, but later left the first 
two towns and fell back to the mountains of the so-called 
chiapan highlands [altos chiapanecos], near the border with 
Guatemala. The first clashes have left an unofficial tally of 
100 dead and several dozen wounded. Even though when they left 
San Cristobal De Las Casas they attacked an Army garrison near 
the town, their initial tactic seemed to be to fall back from 
the occupied areas without offering resistance to the Army in 
order to strike other points in the region. 
  Another rebel commander, who identified himself with his nom 
de guerre, "Lieutenant [teniente] Jesus," said that "the armed 
struggle is the only path for changing the situation of 
oppression and marginalization in which the indigenous persons 
and peasants have been kept for 500 years." "For the poor, all 
the legal paths have been closed for years," added "Lieutenant 
Jesus, "a young man of 18 years of age who was in command of a 
roadblock approximately 25 km from San Cristobal. 
  The insurgent group, whose existence was reported -- and 
officially denied -- last May, has apparently existed for 
several years. "On 1 January the war started, we declared war 
on the enemy, but our organization had existed for many years," 
said the guerrilla "Captain." "At first there were the 
guerrillas that only operated in the mountains, later it grew 
and extended its field of operation. Peasants, teachers, and 
workers joined the movement and that is how we formed the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army," he said. Now -- he added -- 
"we are structured like an army, we have military ranks, as the 
federal Army does, but we are different, we are an army of the 
people, not of the bourgeoisie." 
  Witnesses said at lease 500 guerrillas participated in the 
occupation of the four towns. They were armed with rifles, 
handguns, knives, machetes, and automatic weapons such as 
AK-47's and Mini-14s. Wearing military uniforms and with their 
faces covered with ski caps or red handkerchiefs, they still 
occupied on Monday night the towns of Ocosingo and Altamirano, 
less than 100 km east of San Cristobal de las Casas. At Least 
four roadblocks, placed by the rebels on the road, block the 
access routes to Ocosingo and Altamirano. 
  "Lieutenant Jesus" said the EZLN is prepared for a long war. 
"We will accept many casualties, but will never surrender our 
weapons. We will continue the revolution until we win it with 
the weapons in our hands. That is our objective," he stressed.

<F P=106> [From the "Information Panorama" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On the third day of clashes in Chiapas, the Zapata 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] once again attacked the 31st 
Military Zone, very close to San Cristobal de las Casas. The 
Mexican Army successfully repelled this attack, and immediately 
reinforced military operations in the municipality. Meanwhile, 
the Army has recovered the municipalities of Ocosingo and Las 
Margaritas, although clashes continue in the surrounding areas. 
  According to military sources, so far there have been 86 
deaths in these clashes. Altamirano municipality remains under 
the control of the armed group that has begun to demolish the 
municipal palace. 
  Commenting on the situation in Chiapas, President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari said there is no time or place in Mexico for 
divergence that cannot be solved according to the law. He 
admits there are certain shortages and inequalities in that 
state, but he warns that violence will delay a true solution of 
the problems. 
  The Government Secretariat assured that the groups active in 
Chiapas represent a mixture of interests by local and foreign 
persons who are linked to violent groups operating in Central 
America. Government Under Secretary Socorro Diaz admitted that 
the Mexican Government learned several months ago about the 
existence of illegal groups in that area. 
  Following orders from the Executive Branch, new procedures 
will be established to study the problems in Chiapas. The 
Social Development Secretariat will review the work being done, 
and with the social organizations of that state, it will define 
the projects for the new year. 
  Meanwhile, Chiapas Governor Elmar Setzer has urged the 
people 
of Chiapas to be prudent, and he trusts the Army will shortly 
reestablish peace in Chiapas. Elmar Setzer denied that he is 
planning to resign. 
  Meanwhile, EZLN leaders reiterated they will not negotiate 
with the government so long as the government does not turn 
power over to the people.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Samuel Prieto; from the "Good </F>
Morning From Mexico" newscast] 
  [Text] It is 0630 on 3 January 1994. We begin our journey 
to Ocosingo. Some EZLN [Zapatista Army of National Liberation] 
roadblocks have been erected several kms from the 31st Military 
Zone garrison in Rio Nuevo, Chiapas. A number of the rebels are 
very young, even children. It is not enough to see, however. 
The question we ask this captain, naturally unidentified, deals 
with his remark that he thinks the Armed Forces are bourgeoisie. 
His answer is ideological. He says Mexico should have a 
socialist system. We will have to ask him why, considering that 
this system has not worked in other countries. But the EZLN 
refuses to talk with the government or a mediator. 
  Moving over to the following roadblocks, we observe the 
rebels and their activities more closely. At mess time they 
have stale biscuits dipped in coffee, as well as hardened 
tortillas. We also observe some rebels in formation and others 
in a combat crouch. This is the situation. 
  Las Margaritas municipality has been peacefully vacated by 
the rebels. In Ocosingo, the give and take continues. 
According to the latest reports, the self-styled EZLN is about 
to overpowered. The rebels have sustained 27 casualties. But 
they continue to hold Altamirano. Huitzlan fared better. 
Guerrillas started to leave beginning at 1400 local time. 
Clashes took place in Rancho Nuevo in the afternoon. On 
Monday, LA JORNADA newsman Ismael Romero was shot three times in 
the left shoulder while on his way to Las Margaritas and 
Ocosingo.

  [Excerpt] Tuxtla Gutierrez (Mexico), 4 Jan (EFE) -- 
Military sources have disclosed that clashes between the Armed 
Forces and the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN) increased 
in recent hours near Ocosingo, in Chiapas, as the rebels are 
drawing closer to the capital of this state in southern Mexico. 
  According to unofficial reports, at least 200 people were 
killed in the fighting but it is estimated that there could be 
more bodies scattered in jungle areas and in the cities, but 
access to these sites have been denied to reporters. The 
Mexican Army closed the roads that link Tuxtla Gutierrez, the 
capital of Chiapas, with San Cristobal de las Casas -- where the 
insurrection began on Saturday -- because the rebels are 
approximately 16 km from Tuxtla Gutierrez, military sources told 
EFE. 
  The Armed Forces established a general headquarters outside 
Tuxtla Gutierrez and are keeping all entry into the city under 
very close surveillance. In addition, these forces are totally 
occupying Chiapa de Corzo, one of the main tourist zones, which 
the rebels could use to enter the area. 
  Sources close to the Army noted that 25 rebels were captured 
and that "Commander Marcos" (who headed the attack on San 
Cristobal de las Casas) could be among them. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The situation in the State of Chiapas is as follows: 
  The Mexican Army currently controls the city of San 
Cristobal 
de Las Casas. Clashes that took place last night in the 
municipality of Ocosingo resulted in 27 guerrillas and two 
soldiers dead. The city of Altamirano remains under EZLN 
[Zapatista National Liberation Army] control while Army aircraft 
continue to overfly the region. According to the latest 
reports, the community of (Wisan) remains under guerrillas 
control. In addition, the rebels withdrew from (Otchuc) without 
Army intervention. 
  At least 2,000 additional soldiers arrived in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez which was already under control by the Army. In Las 
Margaritas, the Army entered to retake the city, but it had 
already been abandoned by the guerrillas. The community of 
Chanal was already abandoned voluntarily by the EZLN. 
  In concluding, the guerrillas announced they had mobilized 
in 
Venustiano Carranza and were present in other communities 
located along the Chiapas mountain range and the Guatemalan 
border.

  [Text] The State Government of Chiapas has denied news 
reports to the effect that the Mexican Army and the Zapatista 
rebels are fighting 16 km from Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital 
city. Television Azteca has interviewed Government Secretary 
General Rafael Gonzalez Lastre, as follows: 
  [Begin recording] [Gonzalez] Thank you for this opportunity 
to speak on this channel. Yesterday, we took it upon ourselves 
to inform the people over radio and television. Today, we want 
to urge everyone and all groups to be prudent. Today, more than 
ever before, we must act in a serious, professional, and 
responsible manner. We must not listen to gossip and comments 
that seek to confuse the people and make them restless. 
  The city of Tuxtla Gutierrez and surrounding areas are 
protected. There is no possibility at all that this transgressor 
group will appear here. I have just said there is only one 
small area in Altamirano municipality where there is some 
unrest, and something very small is going on in Ocosingo. 
  [Reporter] Do you have any information on former Governor 
Absalon? 
  [Gonzalez Lastre] Yesterday, it was confirmed to us that 
General Absalon Castellano Dominguez, the former governor of 
Chiapas, is being held by these persons. So far, we have no 
information on his whereabouts, but we fully trust that our 
Mexican Army will once again fulfill its duty and just as it 
rescued the Solorzano family in Ocosingo, it will rescue the 
former governor who also has the honor of belonging to our 
Mexican Army. 
  [Reporter] Mr. Gonzalez: Have the five envoys of the U.S. 
Embassy contacted you? 
  [Gonzalez Lastre] Representatives from the French Embassy 
visited me on Sunday. We learned about the representatives from 
the U.S. Embassy.... [pauses] but I have not had the opportunity 
to meet with them directly and personally as I met with the 
representatives of the French Embassy. I do want to guarantee 
that the Chiapas State Government is ready to give all the 
information and cooperation that its fellow countrymen might 
need. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Text of communique issued by the Mexican National Defense </F>
Secretariat, SDN, on 4 January; place not given; from the "Good 
Afternoon From Mexico" newscast] 
  [Text] The clashes between the transgressors of the law and 
Mexican Army troops continue. On 3 January the aggressor groups 
tried several times to recover the city of Ocosingo by staging 
intermittent attacks which were repelled by the troops. 
  The military personnel are currently -- at 1300 -- receiving 
sporadic fire from snipers in some buildings and on rooftops, 
mainly the Church and the Municipal Presidency. It is known 
that some other groups are still hidden on the outskirts of 
Ocosingo. 
  Up to this moment, the number of casualties inflicted on the 
said group amount to 35 dead and an undetermined number of 
wounded. As has already been reported, they evacuate their 
wounded and their corpses when possible. Furthermore, 35 
weapons, 15 grenades, a large amount of ammunition of diverse 
calibers, and knives, as well as silencers, gas masks, and radio 
equipment have been seized. 
  In the military field of the 31st Military Zone, located 10 
km southeast of the city of San Cristobal [De Las Casas], the 
military personnel have endured constant harassment from 
isolated shots and have captured, on those occasions, eight 
armed individuals who form part of the aggressor groups. These 
men, including a minor, were immediately delivered to the 
authorities of the Federal Attorney General's Office. During 
the night of 2 January, the aforementioned military 
installation, including the housing areas, received intermittent 
rifle fire from snipers. 
  In San Cristobal [De Las Casas], the situation is completely 
calm. 
  Up to this moment and since the beginning of the military 
operations, two officers and five soldiers have died and two 
officers and 14 soldiers have been wounded. On the other hand, 
59 dead have been counted among the members of the transgressor 
groups, and eight of them have been captured. 
  To these [numbers] we have to add the 27 deaths inflicted by 
the aggressor group on the civilian population and the local 
police during the takeover of the four municipal capitals on the 
first day of the year.

<F P=106> [Report by AFP correspondent Gerardo Tena] </F>
  [Text] Altamirano, Mexico, 4 Jan (AFP) -- Several lines of 
Indian peasants advanced this Tuesday on the road from 
Altamirano to San Cristobal, which are separated by 100 km, 
fleeing their communities. 
  Peasants can be seen carrying their belongings on this 
stretch of road, but there is no presence of rebels or the 
regular Army--whose presence is demanded by residents--as in the 
preceding days. 
  Residents of Elzay, a community of 300 Tzeltal Indians, who 
advanced on the route said that the guerrillas were entrenched 
in the community of Tolbeja, approximately eight km from Oxchuc. 
  Peasant Sebastian Lopez said that all the Elzay residents 
were leaving that community, because the members of the EZLN 
[Zapatista National Liberation Army] "considered us their 
enemies, because we were not with them." 
  The Indians who are fleeing are forced to walk, because 
public transportation service has been suspended as a result of 
the insecurity of traveling on the road in addition to the many 
barricades placed along the way. 
  In the communities leading from Altamirano, residents say 
they only have enough food for a few days, and in the places 
where there is telephone service the lines have been cut. 
  "Here, there is no authority, and the military has not come 
to set things straight after the EZLN members left," an Oxchuc 
resident explained. 
  "We do not have water, electricity, or food, and we are 
asking for the Army's help," said Gloria Clemente, 30, a 
resident of Altamirano, a town that was abandoned this morning 
by rebel forces.

<F P=106> [Report by Gerardo Tena] </F>
  [Text] Altamirano, Mexico, 4 Jan (AFP) -- AFP has 
confirmed that the forces of the Zapatista National Liberation 
Army (EZLN) started to partially retreat to the mountains early 
today, but the Mexican Army has not yet entered the towns that 
the rebels have evacuated. 
  Reporters who managed to cross roadblocks erected about 18 
km 
from Ocosingo have said that there are still clashes in that 
town. The Army surrounded it while EZLN members were barricaded 
in several houses. 
  They added that several dead are lying in the streets and 
injured people are seeking refuge. 
  The rebels retreated, taking the injured with them, between 
a 
place known as Rancho Nuevo, about 15 km east of San Cristobal, 
and the town of Altamirano, near Ocosingo. 
  Residents of Oxchuc and Altamirano are nervous and afraid 
that the EZLN will return, because there is no Army presence 
there. 
  Several residents have assured the media that combatants 
from 
El Salvador and Guatemala are among the rebel ranks. "We have 
noticed the way they talk and their strong bodies, and there are 
no people like that here," a peasant said. 
  In Oxchuc, 60 km from San Cristobal, angry residents have 
managed to capture six rebels, beat them up, tie up their feet 
and hands, and take them to the town's main kiosk to turn them 
over to the Mexican Army. 
  The captured, injured by the crowd's beatings, told the 
media 
that they are EZLN members and came to Oxchuc to pick up some 
companeros. 
  Jose Perez Mendez, a 24-year-old peasant whose face was 
bloodstained, said that he has been a member of the subversive 
movement for the past three years, because "the government has 
paid us no attention" and denied that combatants from other 
countries are among his companeros. 
  The neighbors shouted in the Tzeltal language that they did 
not want the guerrillas, according to Juan Santis, who said they 
were angry because the rebels stole their vehicles, burned and 
destroyed municipal offices, and kidnapped the assistant town 
councillor, a policeman, and two other civilians, whom they used 
as their drivers. 
  According to a detainee, the 200 residents who had scrambled 
into the kiosk were saying in Tzeltal that they wanted the 
guerrillas killed. 
  Altamirano, which the EZLN has called "the first liberated 
town," the municipal palace of which was partially destroyed, 
was abandoned between Monday night and Tuesday morning after the 
guerrillas fled into the nearby mountains. 
  On Monday night "some 10 individuals arrived to take away 
six 
injured relatives, one of them in serious condition, in a 
freight truck," bound for an unknown site, according to an 
official at a hospital run by nuns from the Order of the 
Daughters of Charity. The injured rebels, all with bullet 
wounds, need treatment by doctors and medicines, but they did 
not take anything from the hospital, the official said. 
  Neighbors gathered around the journalists in the town square 
to ask them to tell the authorities that they have no means of 
communications and that the Mexican Army should be deployed 
there to protect the lives of the civilian population. 
  On the road leading from Altamirano to San Cristobal, dozens 
of Tzeltal Indian peasants could be seen leaving their villages, 
but rebels were not seen as in previous days. The Army, whose 
presence is demanded by the residents, was not to be seen either.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 4 Jan (AFP) -- 
Three airplanes of the Mexican Air Force unexpectedly bombed a 
hill in the outskirts of San Cristobal de las Casas during a 
clash with members of the Zapatista National Liberation Army 
(EZLN) in a military spectacle that was watched by residents of 
San Juan de los Lagos neighborhood. 
  The residents climbed on rooftops and other high places to 
follow the actions of the three airplanes and a helicopter in 
this location where the presence of guerrillas had been unknown. 
  The rebels responded to the bombing with submachine-gun 
fire. 
The number of casualties is unknown. The action occurred about 
10 km from the center of San Cristobal, a town which the EZLN 
members maintained under their control on 1 January. 
  The battle site is alongside the highway linking San 
Cristobal with Ocosingo, toward which the guerrilla forces are 
reportedly pulling back after issuing a "declaration of war" 
against the Mexican Government and Army on 1 January.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 4 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The 
Mexican Air Force launched today a brief operation in a 
mountainous area near this southeastern Chiapas city against 
armed groups dislodged from several towns, witnesses reported. 
  Local clergyman Gonzalo Ituarte Verduzco said that airplanes 
and a helicopter fired shots between 1700 and 1800 (2300 and 
0000 GMT) near El Corralito, southeast of San Cristobal de la 
Casas, and the armed groups responded from the ground. 
  San Cristobal de las Casas, one of the first cities seized 
on 
1 January and occupied the following day by armed men of the 
so-called Zapatista National Liberation Army, is under the 
control of civilian and military authorities. 
  The violent seizure of towns and Army attacks have left 96 
dead, including 59 members of the armed groups, 22 policemen, 
seven soldiers, and five civilians, according to official 
reports.

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, 4 Jan (EFE) -- The Mexican 
Army has expelled the rebels from the town of Altamirano, which 
was their last bastion in the Mexican State of Chiapas and where 
a heavy exchange of fire is still going on, media sources said 
today, Tuesday. 
  The rebels seem to have taken refuge in the Lacandon Jungle, 
to where they have been pushed by Army troops, who chase and 
bomb them, journalist of the Tuxtla Gutierrez daily "CUARTO 
PODER" told EFE. 
  Military sources told our informants that the chase has 
extended to the town of San Juan Chamula, in the Lacandon 
Jungle, where residents captured four rebels who were armed with 
harquebus-type shotguns. 
  The Army expelled the rebels from the town of Altamirano, 
the 
last of seven towns they had occupied and which still remained 
under their control. 
  In Altamirano shooting between the rebels and Army was still 
heard, however. Fighting has left at least 121 dead, half of 
whom are Zapatista rebels, according to official sources. 
  A journalist of the daily "CUARTO PODER" told EFE that the 
Mexican Army controls totally three of the four municipalities 
in which the rebels had concentrated.

  [Text] Guatemala will not permit incursions by armed 
individuals into that territory, stated Guatemalan Ambassador to 
Mexico Alejandro Maldonado. He said that the patrolling of 
Guatemala's border with Chiapas is normal and that no one can 
cross the border illegally. 
  In leaving Los Pinos Residence, where Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas received new year greetings from the diplomatic 
corp accredited to Mexico, Maldonado said that Guatemala cannot 
cooperate with Mexico in resolving the armed conflict in 
northern Chiapas State. Let's hear what he had to say: 
  [Begin Maldonado recording] The Guatemalan Government has to 
protect its own borders, Guatemalan territory. Regarding 
cooperation, nothing has been said about that, and we do not 
think it is necessary, because we believe that the Mexican state 
has complete and absolute control over its actions. [end 
recording] 
  The diplomat denied that there are Guatemalans involved in 
the Chiapas conflict and that the problem there could extend 
beyond the border and become a regional problem.

<F P=106> [Report by Antonio Barragan; from the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Mexican Bishops Conference issued an official 
communique today on the events that have occurred in Chiapas. 
The communique is signed by Monsignor Ramon Godinez Flores, 
auxiliary bishop of Guadalajara and secretary general of 
Mexico's Bishop conference and, therefore, official spokesman of 
the Mexican Catholic Church. In the communique, Flores stated 
that the Bishops Conference called for respectful and truthful 
dialogue between both parties; in addition, he stated that 
dialogue is necessary, adding that those who assumed arms must 
be heard, because they have been unheard for a long time. 
  The most important part of this one-and-a-half page 
communique reads: What must we do? First of all, we must hear 
the clamor of these brothers and many more Mexicans, some of 
whom have assumed arms, others who are taking refuge in not 
participating in the elections, as well as others who are 
desperate over not finding solutions to the crises we are 
facing. This is like a voice of God; we must all hear and know 
how to interpret it. 
  Flores also added in his communique: Those who have 
authority must be attentive to discover the sense of these 
voices and not try to repress them violently. These are voices 
of anguish and desperation. The very peasants who assumed arms 
have said this is not a war to destroy, rather, to build a 
better fatherland. 
  Commenting on this situation, Flores, as official spokesman 
of the Mexican Bishops Conference, said: 
  [Begin recording] [Flores] These are incidents that must be 
dealt with carefully. They cannot simply be interpreted as a 
confrontation between one army against another or for a 
political change. They are requesting that their just demands 
be met, and they themselves must be a part of this to overcome 
these difficulties. They cannot just wait until their 
difficulties are solved; they must act to overcome their crises. 
[end recording] 
  The church representative explained later that Christians 
must pray so that God will give us a peaceful heart and we may 
act with prudence and wisdom in these difficult times. He said: 
This will permit us to build peace based on justice, making the 
plan of God--who gave us the resources of nature to benefit all 
and not a few--a reality. 
  This is the most important part of the official communique 
by 
the Mexican Bishops Conference on the events in Chiapas, issued 
on 4 January 1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Gerardo Tena] </F>
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 4 Jan (AFP) -- 
Samuel Ruiz, San Cristobal de las Casas bishop, spotlighted 
today reports on the execution of rebel Indians by the Mexican 
Army in Chiapas State, site of fighting in the past few days. 
  There are reports that certain guerrillas captured by the 
Army have been executed, the bishop said during a news 
conference. The bishop also said that it is "foreseeable" the 
civilian population will be repressed by the Army, because there 
has not been a delimitation of the battlefields where soldiers 
are fighting the guerrilla Zapatista National Liberation Army 
(EZLN). 
  The bishop, who held a news conference minutes before the 
Air 
Force bombed a hill in the outskirts of San Cristobal, said that 
approximately 12,000 Army troops are deployed in the strife-torn 
region. 
  The prelate, who is involved in the defense of human rights, 
particularly that of poor Indians, said that the Army's massive 
military response "seems to be a decision" to totally crush the 
movement, and in this framework "there are many wounded people 
who have not even been counted." 
  Ruiz called on the two sides to agree on a cease-fire so as 
to begin negotiations with the church mediation to lay the 
foundations for a concerted effort to end the conflict, which 
broke out on 1 January when EZLN members violently occupied five 
municipalities in the southern State of Chiapas. 
  He recommended that the situation be observed by national 
and 
foreign human rights observers, and he mentioned that Americas 
Watch, Amnesty International, and Lawyers of Minnesota are 
willing to come to the region to observe the situation.

  [Text] Mexico City, 4 Jan (AFP) -- A communique of the 
Mexican Presidency announced today that Salvadoran President 
Alfredo Cristiani and Honduran President Rafael Callejas will 
visit Mexico on 7 January to meet with Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas. 
  The communique stated that the Central American presidents' 
visit was agreed upon in early December and that the trilateral 
agenda does not include "the topic of the situation in Los Altos 
de Chiapas," where an armed Indian rebellion has been taking 
place since 1 January. 
  The communique also stated that on the night of 3 January 
Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio spoke with Salinas to 
discuss several topics, including the situation in Chiapas. The 
communique explained that the Guatemalan president proposed to 
the Mexican president "an exchange of information." 
  The guerrilla outbreak by the Zapatista National Liberation 
Army [EZLN] is taking place in southern Chiapas State, on the 
border with Guatemala. 
  Guatemalan Army sources have reported the possibility of a 
link between the EZLN and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity, which has rejected that charge. 
  Mexican Government sources told AFP that the idea that there 
are Central Americans in the EZLN ranks is being confirmed, and 
they even said that "there is a Guatemalan" in the leadership of 
that guerrilla organization.

  [Text] Social Development Secretary Carlos Rojas Gutierrez 
traveled to Tuxtla Gutierrez to devise a plan for new economic 
and technical support that will contribute in reversing the 
serious backwardness in Chiapas State. 
  Although Chiapas State heads the government's list for 
social 
investment, new plans to fight poverty, despair, and historical 
backwardness in this state will be announced today; for that 
purpose, Social Development Secretary Rojas Gutierrez arrived in 
Tuxtla Gutierrez today. Accompanied by federal and state 
officials, he immediately convened a roundtable, which will 
involve new government institutions. 
  Meeting participants recognized the problems caused by 
existing backwardness in Chiapas State that basically affect the 
Indians. They noted, however, that for the past five years the 
government has considered Chiapas a priority for social 
investments, which have been increased by more than 1,000 
percent during that period. New economic and technical 
assistance to satisfy the needs of this neglected state will be 
defined during this meeting. 
  Chiapas Governor Elmar Zetzer again urged Chiapas residents 
this morning not to heed rumors. He reaffirmed that the Mexican 
Army will certainly have the situation totally under control 
soon.

  [Editorial Report] Mexico City XEW Television Network in 
Spanish at 1200 GMT on 4 January broadcasts, as part of its 
"ECO" news service, a four-minute report on reaction from 
various Mexican political parties to the recent armed 
insurrection and subsequent official reaction to events in 
Chiapas State. 
  In a communique issued on 3 January, PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] President Fernando Ortiz Arana strongly 
condemned the violence. The communique states: "Legitimate 
demands for greater social welfare can be only fulfilled through 
peace." The text adds: "The PRI asked the government to enforce 
the laws and thoroughly investigate and identify those 
responsible for these incidents. The PRI reiterates its support 
for authorities in Chiapas and the Mexican Army to continue 
acting in accordance with the law and confirms its determination 
that dialogue would be in the best interests of all Mexicans." 
  PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] President Porfirio 
Munoz Ledo condemned and regretted the incidents in Chiapas. 
Munoz Ledo noted: "Everyone's first reaction, regardless of 
political party or ideological conviction, has been to reject 
clearly and categorically the use of violence as the means of 
solving problems in Mexico." 
  PAN [National Action Party] Deputy Secretary General Cecilia 
Romero said in reaction: "It is necessary that the source of 
these incidents be clarified, responsibilities be defined, 
factions involved be investigated thoroughly, and authorities 
explain to the Mexican people how they plan to resolve this 
conflict definitively." 
  Mexican Ecological Party [PEM] presidential candidate Jorge 
Gonzalez said: "A calm analysis of events is essential to a 
clear understanding and to stopping bloodshed throughout the 
country."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through 4 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  The Exports and Investments Center of Costa Rica on 28 
December reported that sales of products and services to foreign 
nations increased more than 50 percent between 1990 and 1993, 
although the trade balance is in deficit. According to the 
Central Bank, imports in 1990 amounted to $1.98 billion, whereas 
in 1993 they reached $3 billion. The same source added that the 
1993 trade balance has an $800 million deficit. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 1859 GMT 28 Dec 93) 
  Finance Minister Carlos Munoz announced that interest rates 
in 1994 will be lower than in 1993. Higher rates will continue 
to be used for several months while some adjustments are made. 
(San Jose Radio Reloj in Spanish 1730 GMT 29 Dec 93) 
  Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier 
reported 
on 3 January that inflation during 1993 was 9.05 percent. 
Economy Minister Roberto Rojas explained that this was due to a 
reduction in the prices of many items after some taxes were 
lifted in April. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0007 GMT 4 Jan

  [Text] The 190th anniversary of national independence was 
observed in Gonaives on 1 January by members of the high General 
Staff of the Haitian Army. On that occasion, Lieutenant General 
Raoul Cedras launched a call for a national debate, the only 
means of achieving the union necessary for the rebirth of our 
homeland. Gen. Cedras would like this national debate to be an 
occasion for the nation to ask itself about itself, about its 
future, and to look for solutions to the structural problems 
that hinder social evolution and the development of republican 
institutions. 
  The commander in chief of the Haitian Army explained that to 
achieve this union, we must, just as the fathers of our 
independence did, all decide to unite under one banner. Gen. 
Cedras explained that Haitians must complete their dream of 
liberty, equality, justice, and fraternity as projected by our 
ancestors. 
  With regard to the current crisis, Gen. Cedras asserted that 
the months of suffering have taught us to know ourselves and to 
evaluate the men and women of this country. They have taught us 
in a very difficult way what meaningless weight [words 
indistinct] our lives as men and women, and our future as a 
people, before the incomprehensible special interests of a few.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 4 Jan 94 (AFP) -- During a speech in 
Gonaives (152 km northwest of the capital) on occasion of the 
190th anniversary of Haitian independence, Army chief General 
Raoul Cedras proposed an "ample dialogue" to overcome the 
Haitian crisis. 
  "Only a sincere understanding on the essential, the first 
step toward an indispensable union, can save the country," the 
general noted adding that "this understanding must be the result 
of ample dialogue." "It is essential for it to be a national 
debate. The country must question itself, its future. It must 
find solutions for the structural problems that are obstructing 
the evolution of society and the free play of democratic 
institutions," Cedras said. 
  "By losing brotherhood, all that is left for us is division, 
hatred, and violence," he stated, adding that "1994 will be 
decisive for our country."

<F P=106> [Report by Jean-Ralph Fleurizard] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] We should consider setting 
aside, by private agreement, the two antagonistic plans that 
dominate the political scene. This ia proposed by Professor 
Leslie Manigat, leader of the Assembly of Progressive National 
Democrats [RDNP]. Speaking for the first time since the fifth 
convention of his party, Manigat has proposed a (?set) of 
balanced concessions, a kind of equitable compromise aimed at 
balancing the scales between the parties. In the opinion of 
[former] President Manigat, this compromise is essentially aimed 
at lossening the vise which is stifling the country, at 
facilitating the emergence of the third centrist democratic 
stand, and finally at allowing the mobilization of cooperative 
action by men of goodwill. [passage omitted] 
  Leslie Manigat, who believes that Haitian politics must be 
conducted in an atmosphere of sincerity, thinks Father 
Aristide's return as president is neither possible nor 
desirable. What is obvious, in Manigat's opinion, is that 
Aristide's return to power cannot be the appropriate solution. 
Also, he wants to put the government of President Aristide in 
the dock. He invites the international community to change its 
(?stand) and to organize the post-Aristide period. [passage 
omitted] 
  Once again, Manigat says he has stayed on the sidelines so 
as 
to have a national and responsible voice heard. Although the 
RDNP leader is convinced that times have never been so hard for 
the majority of the people, that a national collapse has taken 
place, and that the gap between the capital and the provinces 
has become an abyss, he nevertheless is optimistic -- but 
cautious. In his opinion, one must not despair because one can 
do better than survive. He says one is even able to eventually 
rise above conditions. He criticizes the sanctions imposed on 
Haiti, sanctions he deems illegal and outrageous.

<F P=106> [Report by Melisa Soto; from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Nine inmates and one National Guard member have 
died in Aragua State, while 40 prisoners have escaped from the 
Tocoron Jail through a tunnel which they built. 
  Director of Prisons Dora Bracho de Briceno has confirmed 
this 
when asked about the current situation of the country's (?32) 
jails, which house approximately 25,000 inmates. In that 
regard, she said that her office has instructed the National 
Guard to adopt the necessary emergency measures in all of the 
country's jails to prevent a repetition of the recent incidents 
in Maracaibo. She added that the situation in Ciudad Bolivar 
Jail--where inmates began a hunger strike, demanding better 
conditions--is under control; finally, she said that what 
occurred in Sabaneta should be a lesson for the government and 
society. 
  [Begin Bracho de Briceno recording] There are five types of 
inmates, all under one roof. This is what has caused the 
current situation; in addition, there is only one jail for the 
entire state, which is inadmissible due to the large distances 
between one place to the other. In certain cases inmates must 
travel eight, nine, or 10 hours to appear before a court; an 
example of this is Santa Barbara de Zulia, where there are 115 
prisoners. [end recording] 
  Bracho de Briceno will travel to Maracaibo today to assess 
the situation at the Sabaneta Jail. It was also learned that 
the National Guard has been instructed to adopt emergency 
measures in all of the country's jails to prevent a similar 
tragedy.

  [Text] On the very day that the Search Bloc shot down Pablo 
Escobar, EL TIEMPO and the firm Yankelovich Innova de Colombia 
asked Colombians for their opinions on the final episode in this 
17-year history. The poll revealed that the majority would have 
preferred the voluntary surrender of the most wanted drug 
trafficker in the world. 
  Whereas 76.7 percent of those polled responded affirmatively 
to the question, "Would you have preferred Pablo Escobar's 
voluntary surrender?", only 14.2 percent replied that they would 
not. 
  Of the four cities surveyed (Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and 
Barranquilla), the latter had the most responses favoring 
surrender, with 82.5 percent affirmative answers. It was 
followed by Medellin, with 80 percent; Cali, with 79.7 percent; 
and Bogota, with 73.1 percent. 
  In Medellin and Cali, 11.4 and 8.7 percent, respectively, 
answered that they would not have preferred Pablo Escobar's 
voluntary surrender. 
  Nevertheless, the majority of those queried described the 
drug trafficker's death as a positive event. This claim was made 
by 48.3 percent, compared with 12.4 percent who considered it 
negative. It was immaterial to 30.3 percent of those polled. 
  In Medellin, however, Pablo Escobar's death was immaterial 
to 
the majority of persons (40.9 percent); whereas 33 percent 
regarded the event as positive, and 13.9 percent viewed it as 
negative. 
  In Cali, on the other hand, 48.1 percent replied that it was 
positive; 30.4 percent said that it was immaterial to them; and 
13.9 percent described it as negative. 
  As for the possible consequences of Pablo Escobar's death 
for 
the law and order situation and drug trafficking activity, those 
polled thought that there would be very few repercussions. 
  According to the results, 34.4 percent did not believe that 
the law and order situation would be affected, and over half 
expected drug trafficking activity to remain the same. 
  These are the optimists: 29.1 percent thought that the law 
and order situation would improve, and 29.3 expected the drug 
traffic to decline. 
  And these are the negativists: 11.5 percent claimed that 
drug 
trafficking activity would increase, and 23.5 percent expected 
the law and order situation to worsen. 
  Bogota residents, however, were more positive compared with 
those of Cali, Barranquilla, and Medellin; because there were 
more in the nation's capital who thought that the law and order 
situation would improve than there were those expecting it to 
worsen. 
  In Cali, on the other hand, a larger number of those queried 
claimed that the law and order situation would remain the same, 
representing 40.5 percent of the responses; while 25.3 percent 
expected it to worsen. Only 12.7 percent replied that it would 
improve. 
  In Medellin, 32.2 percent responded that the law and order 
situation would remain the same; 30.4 percent expected it to 
improve; and 20.9 percent thought that it would worsen. 
  With regard to drug trafficking activity, in Cali, for 
example, 58.2 percent of those polled replied that it would 
remain unchanged, whereas 26.6 percent claimed that it would 
decline, and only 8.9 percent expected it to increase. 
  In Medellin, 47.8 percent believed that drug trafficking 
activity would remain the same; 25.2 percent expected it to 
decline; and only 12.2 percent maintained that it would rise. 
  In the breakdown by sex, more women than men would have 
preferred Pablo Escobar's voluntary surrender. Similarly, more 
women than men expected the drug trafficking activity to remain 
the same.

<H5>  Poll Profile </H5>
  On 2 and 3 December (the same day and the one following the 
death of Pablo Escobar), EL TIEMPO and the firm Yankelovich 
Innova de Colombia began taking the public opinion poll. 
  The four questions were asked, by telephone, of a sample of 
500 persons in four cities: Bogota, Medellin, Cali, and 
Barranquilla. 
  The distribution was as follows: Bogota, 250 polled (50 
percent); Medellin, 113 polled (23 percent); Cali, 83 polled (17 
percent); and Barranquilla, 54 polled (10 percent). 
  A certain number of surveys were made in each city, based on 
the socioeconomic distribution of the Colombian population: 25 
percent representing the upper stratum; 60 percent, the middle 
stratum; and 25 percent, the lower stratum [as published]. 
  Of those polled, 41.4 percent were of the male sex, and 58.6 
percent, female. The majority had completed their studies for a 
high school diploma, or had a higher level education.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Profiles of 1995"] </F>
  [Text] The race for the presidency of the Republic has 
begun, although it appears to be a timid start, if we look to 
the public statements of the possible candidates. But if we had 
access to the intimate thoughts of each of the possible 
presidential candidates, it is certain that we would find a 
rather mature decision. 
  What stage has the battle for the 1995 presidency reached? 
The first certainty is that there are only 16 months left before 
the election date. The second fact, and this is perhaps the 
decisive one, is that the results of the referendum have not 
only altered the political map, but also seem to have mobilized 
the presidential ambitions of various individuals. 
  The scenario has certainly become more complicated, because 
the opposition to the government has become bolder. But it is 
also a fact that in Fujimori's party sector, more than one 
hopeful has emerged. Up until the date of the referendum, it was 
possible to foresee the launching of a single candidate by the 
entire opposition as the only proper card to play to defeat the 
current chief of state. Today the opposition appears to believe 
it is even strong enough to be spared the need to agree on a 
single alternative. But not only that. Now the possibility of a 
Fujimori party without Fujimori is developing more broadly than 
could have been imagined just a few short weeks ago. 
  Given this context, it is of interest to attempt to profile 
the first individuals to enter the field--Ricardo Belmont (RBC), 
Daniel Estrada, and Hernando de Soto. 
  Ricardo Belmont has already had a skirmish with Government 
Palace. It occurred last August, and the truth is, according to 
the surveys taken then and despite the limited attendance at the 
meeting convoked in Manco Capac Square in connection with what 
had happened, he did not do badly in his clash with the 
executive branch. 
  The IMASEN undertook a survey during those weeks that it we 
would do well to recall. To begin with, a very high 70 percent 
of the population of Lima admitted having "knowledge of the 
conflict between Ricardo Belmont and the president of the 
Republic." A substantial 53 percent believed that the government 
was failing to provide Belmont with the resources needed for the 
administration of his department. And further still, about 27 
percent were convinced that the government was not giving the 
mayor the needed resources "because Belmont might be successful 
as a candidate for the presidency." Not even water could be 
clearer. And it should be no surprise that "Hermanon" has very 
carefully evaluated the positive results of these encounters 
with Engineer Fujimori (AFF). 
  However, in that same month, the IMASEN compared AFF and RBC 
as presidential candidates. The former won out, with 58.7 
percent as compared to the 20.8 percent for the mayor of Lima. 
Now "El Colorao" may be thinking that the referendum has 
broadened his space and that the months still remaining before 
the electoral date may favor him even further. This man always 
"thinks positive." 
  But in the most recent issue of IMASEN CONFIDENCIAL 
(November 
1993), the administration of the mayor of Lima received good 
marks--an approval rating of 61.4 percent as compared to a 
rejection rating of 31 percent. (This survey was taken 
exclusively in Lima.) 
  The conclusion reached by this same survey organization is 
that Belmont is maintaining his position, and that his approval 
rate is improving in the lowest stratum and declining in the 
middle-upper strata. This means, of course, that he would be a 
candidate who would for the most part eat into a portion of the 
same social strata as the current incumbent in Government Palace. 
  However, Belmont's possible candidacy raises several 
questions. Thus far it has been a phenomenon limited to Lima 
(although it is true that he enjoys broad acceptance in the 
poorer sectors). He has not, therefore, had an opportunity to 
assess how well he would be accepted in the country's provinces, 
which are today so sensitive to the centralism in Lima. 
  Another matter of concern regarding Belmont is his habit of 
improvising. A few days ago, he made the statement during a 
political program that a political platform for governing should 
be drafted by technicians, who could readily be hired on 
contract. This statement, of course, reminds us of one made by 
Luis Bedoya Reyes some decades ago now. 
  All of this seems to the mayor of Lima to be a matter of 
image and "projects." As for the rest, as he says, it would be 
up to the technicians hired. All of which is, naturally, highly 
debatable, when it comes to managing a city like Lima, and to an 
even greater extent, when one is trying to administer a country. 
  This characteristic, which has heretofore been a part of 
RBC's charismatic "spontaneity," might be a highly vulnerable 
point when he is compared with other candidates who appear more 
solid and combine proposals with image. He has, moreover, 
revealed this more dangerous side when, for example, candidates 
lacking any prior knowledge about or evaluation for their 
positions have been chosen. There have been such flagrant 
instances as those involving Jorge Vasquez, in Villa El 
Salvador; and Jose Rubio, in San Martin de Porres. 
  A few months ago, Belmont said that he would not run as a 
candidate for the presidency. And that he was not very 
comfortable in a tie, or in a suit, either, while men like 
Carlos Bolona could indeed wear them much more naturally. The 
allusion could not be clearer. If the candidate was the issue, 
he already had his own. The former minister of economy favored 
him, and very nearly put his name forward. What has changed 
between that time and the present? Perhaps it is that Fujimori 
no longer seems to Belmont as monolithic as before, and that his 
second municipal experience has convinced him that he is now 
ready to play in the first division. 
  One could also surmise that Belmont's affinity for Bolona 
has 
not dwindled, that he is teamed with "Car'e bebe," and that they 
might well join together on a single "super-Lima" platform. 
  But what does Belmont offer that differentiates him from 
Fujimori? RBC maintained a notable level of agreement with 
Government Palace until he ran for office a second time at the 
beginning of this year. It will readily be remembered that when 
Pablo Gutierrez, the candidate of the government party for the 
position of mayor of Lima, was headed downhill, AFF could find 
no better alternative than to throw his support to RBC. It is 
also a fact that in this instance, Belmont was very cautious, 
and made it clear that no one owed anybody anything, and that he 
had won thanks to his own efforts. But the internal coup of 5 
April and many of Fujimori's measures had already won the 
support of the municipality. 
  Belmont then is the man who might say he offers as an 
alternative a Fujimori movement without Fujimori, probably in an 
attempt to show that the difference he would make has to do with 
respect for the autonomy of the institutions. The difference 
would be, then, more one of style and communication methods than 
one of political proposals. 
  Would the business community in Lima support a candidacy 
like 
that of Belmont? This remains to be seen. It will depend on how 
much strength he gains in the coming months, and what he can 
offer the businessmen. The mayor's ambitious program for 
rebuilding historic Lima will not, of course, be enough. 
  Another candidate who has practically joined the race is 
Daniel Estrada. The mayor of Cusco is up to a point the 
anti-image of Belmont. Perhaps it is not, therefore, without 
reason that his anticentralist ideas are identified, under some 
circumstances, with an anti-Lima attitude. 
  As is obvious, Estrada wants to garner the provincial votes, 
and he recently spoke of the need to achieve a major pact 
involving various regional sectors in order to defeat the 
central power. The results of the recent elections give him a 
basis for this venture, particularly since that, precisely, is 
Fujimori's weak point. 
  Estrada's credentials are based on his successful municipal 
administration record in the city of Cusco, and he intends to 
increase his appeal with his anticentralist proposals, now 
combined with a plan, debatable in the eyes of many, for a 
federal Peruvian state. However, his current strength may also 
prove to be a hindrance to his broader national acceptance. 
  Estrada is not like any other anticentralist leader, since 
he 
insists on emphasizing the heritage and representation of the 
ancestral Cusco. The question arises as to how he would 
integrate this particular characteristic with a national debate 
and plan that would not only include the other regions, which 
are so dissimilar and so "regionalistic," but also Lima itself, 
with its highly diverse population. 
  On the other hand, could the interregional pact he so much 
desires be achieved? The first obstacle is the difficulty of 
obtaining the support of the other regional leaders who have 
party affiliations, like Jose Murgia, of Trujillo, or whose 
representation is clearly local, with roots more in the coastal 
population than the Incas, such as Tito Chocano, the mayor of 
Tacna. 
  It must also be remembered that Estrada makes no secret of a 
style that is sometimes authoritarian. During a recent 
television appearance, he justified the events of 5 April and 
criticized the old parliament harshly. His only criticism of 
Fujimori's authoritarianism was that it was too cold and 
"robot-like." 
  It is difficult to imagine what the mayor of Cusco would do 
if he were installed in Government Palace. There can be no doubt 
that an anticentralist policy would be promoted at full speed, 
but what is unknown is what his institutional administration 
would be like, and what his relations would be, with the 
parliament, with the political parties, and with the Armed 
Forces, for example. The same can be said about his economic 
policy. The unknown factors predominate, but there are still 
several months remaining in which they could be clarified. 
  Carlos Bolona (CBB) is another individual who is making 
incursions in the party sector. It is said that there is one 
group of businessmen who have confidence in him, and that these 
individuals are prepared to play him as their card in the hope 
of replacing Fujimori. 
  Bolona has established his institute, and he issues rather 
regular opinions on current political subjects. The profile of 
his possible candidacy is for the time being less clearly drawn 
that of the others. But his interest in the presidency has been 
more or less obvious for some time now. 
  The leading credential CBB has to offer is his 
administration 
as head of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. This action, 
which won applause in one sector, provoked criticism in another. 
As a result, it is quite probable that if Bolona should in the 
end be persuaded to launch his candidacy, he would have to 
broaden his base of support. He would need a good running 
mate--perhaps one of provincial origin, and a "marketing 
campaign" to modify his very capital-oriented image and his 
apparent extreme closeness with wealthy business sectors. 
  The support of General Jaime Salinas Sedo's precandidacy by 
Javier Valle Riestra and Gustavo Mohme represents the initial 
effort to clarify the image of the most obvious opposition 
candidate today. Salinas Sedo could be the "more combative" 
candidate Fernando Belaunde is demanding to oppose Fujimori. 
  Without a doubt, his candidacy represents the polarization 
of 
the government and the current high military commanders. There 
are basically two obstacles for Salinas Sedo at the present. One 
is winning over the more centrist sectors that are less radical 
in their opposition to the government, and the other is 
overcoming the problems of a legal nature that could be put 
forward formally to block his candidacy. 
<H5>  "Get Ready, Get Set" </H5>
  Hernando de Soto also seems to be adjusting his stance at 
the 
starting line. Last week, he made public his proposed 
constitutional reform by popular initiative. This week he 
announced that next Tuesday, the Freedom and Democracy Institute 
(ILD) and the popular institutions supporting his proposal will 
launch a campaign to obtain the 35,000 signatures the new 
constitution requires in order for the Congress to consider the 
possibility of amendment. 
  Last week he also paid a visit to the premises of the CUAVES 
[Urban Self-Management Community of Villa El Salvador], and the 
National Agrarian Confederation published a statement praising 
the ILD initiative. On the day of the press conference at which 
the reform proposal was announced, the presence of some 
well-known peasant leaders who were active for years in the 
leftist sector, such as Marcial Quintana and Jorge Arevalo from 
Piura, was notable. 
  The organization of a meeting of 400 delegates representing 
the social organizations throughout the country scheduled to be 
held on 18 and 19 December to rally support for the reform 
proposal set forth seems to be the last step in this first stage 
of preparations for the probable candidacy of De Soto. 
  And so his electoral strategy would begin with advocacy of a 
great concerted union among the representatives of all the 
sectors of society. As an alternative to a concertation based 
principally on interparty agreement, the president of the ILD 
proposes a union supported by the base-level movements. 
  A careful consideration of their proposals reveals that 
neither Belmont, nor Estrada, nor De Soto is urging an agreement 
achieved mainly by the parties, although De Soto may perhaps be 
the individual most desirous of clarifying his disagreement with 
the so-called "partidocracy." 
  De Soto's proposal combines economic liberalism and 
democratization of the state. In a way, it is another version of 
a Fujimori platform without Fujimori. The president of the ILD 
not only collaborated with the present chief of state during a 
certain period, but has also given explicit support to the 
government's economic policy. In this realm, De Soto has let 
slip some criticisms of government improvisation. He has, for 
example, expressed his annoyance at the lack of serious effort 
to promote projects such as substitution for the coca leaf as a 
crop. However, he has endorsed the central aspects of the 
program. 
  The basic disagreement with the current regime he is 
attempting to demonstrate has to do with the democratization of 
the state. In this connection, his proposal for constitutional 
reform calls for the establishment of closer links between 
society and the political regime. 
  The challenges facing his possible candidacy begin with the 
need to ensure that his image "catches on" with the national 
electorate. Unlike Belmont and Estrada, De Soto has not run for 
political office previously. He does not, therefore, have a 
reference point on the basis of which he can project his image 
as a government leader. 
  One unknown factor is how his liberal economic proposal will 
sit with the middle and small businessmen's portion of the 
national business sector, so as to avoid its ending up as a 
simple neomercantilists' adjunct--a dilemma the Fujimori 
government is definitely faced with at present, whatever one's 
view of it may be. 
<H5>  A Hibernating Candidate </H5>
  Perez de Cuellar (JPC) is in a state of hibernation, but he 
has not by any means vanished as a possible candidate. According 
to the most recent surveys on the subject, JPC is the individual 
who appears to be in the best position to challenge AFF for the 
presidency in 1995. 
  In addition to that, the opposition parties in the CCD have 
given him their support, and he may very well be endorsed by the 
sectors that voted "yes" in the recent referendum but have lost 
confidence in Fujimori. JPC's great difficulty is that he has 
made a great consensus a prerequisite, and it appears that 
achieving this will be very difficult. 
  Perez de Cuellar has confirmed that he will visit Peru in 
the 
middle of December. He will be here for some weeks, and will 
utilize the opportunity to test the air. 
  During his earlier visit, he met with leading personalities 
who wanted him to run for the presidency. This meeting took 
place at the home of the painter Fernando de Szyszlo. It is not 
known if he will attend similar meetings this time.

<F P=106> [News conference by Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani </F>
with reporters following the ceremony launching the National 
Civilian Police in Soyapango on 3 Jan--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [LA PRENSA GRAFICA reporter 
Gerardo Lopez] Good morning, Mr. President. I have two 
questions. Last week an ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] 
deputy said that there was proof of the transshipment of arms 
from the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] to 
Guatemala; the second question is what is your opinion regarding 
the incidents that are taking place in Mexico? 
  [Cristiani] I believe that as far as specific proof is 
concerned, the reports from Guatemalan authorities claim that 
there is a shipment of arms to Guatemala. There is no specific 
proof, however, of who is shipping the weapons. We want to be 
very clear about this, because we are not going to accuse anyone 
until we are entirely certain. We are continuing to coordinate 
with Guatemalan authorities in this respect. We are conducting 
an investigation, and as soon as we have any information you 
will hear about it. 
  One thing is clear, however, certain weapons were not 
available in Guatemala, and today they are being recovered by 
the Guatemalan Army; this shows that there is a flow of weapons 
into Guatemala, and there are only two neighboring countries 
through which they could be passing--Honduras and El 
Salvador--although they might be coming from Nicaragua and pass 
through El Salvador. Why is there is no specific proof yet? 
  Concerning Mexico, we deplore the fact that there are still 
groups on our continent that are trying to use violence and 
terror to achieve political aims. We believe that this must pass 
into history so that novelists can write about it, but it cannot 
be justified in view of the advances of the processes in Latin 
America. We cannot justify the existence of armed rebel groups 
causing violence and terror, particularly against the people, 
who are the ones who always suffer the most in activities of 
this type. 
  We believe that if countries such as El Salvador have been 
able to give an example of solutions to these problems, it is 
shocking to hear that there are groups that now want to launch 
such an adventure. Experiences in other places show us that the 
idea is to do away with, not encourage, activities of this type; 
consequently, we can only feel disappointed to see that on the 
American Continent there are still minority groups bent on using 
violent methods. 
  [Reporter Mario Godoy Landin] Good morning, Mr. President. 
My first question has to do with the transshipment of arms. 
How is the verification of the serial numbers of the AK-47 
rifles that were found in Guatemala progressing? Have they 
already been verified? The second question is, regarding the 
violence and murder of several peasant families in different 
areas of the country could one consider that the deployment of 
Armed Forces members has not achieved anything? 
  [Cristiani] Regarding your first question, I do not have the 
information on hand. We will try to check to see if there is 
specific information regarding the serial numbers, and we will 
release the information as soon as something is obtained. 
  Regarding your second question, I do not believe that the 
fact that criminal actions are perpetrated means that something 
has or has not failed. In this case I would like to ask if we 
would not have had a larger number of incidents without the 
preventive deployment in the area? This is something that is 
very hard to measure. What is obvious is that there is much 
violent activity and that many problems, even family problems, 
are being resolved violently. Maybe this is due to what our 
country has gone through. A large number of Salvadorans have 
been exposed to a tradition of violence and believe that 
problems can only be solved through violence. I do not believe, 
however, that one can come to the conclusion at which you 
arrived: that one thing is directly linked to the other. The 
question should be, had the deployment not been carried out 
would there have been more or less violent incidents? [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, Dec 28 (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
today renewed his attacks against the UCR [Radical Civic Union] 
and some newspapers. He said the Radicals "are totally wrong and 
their arguments are groundless" and charged that the press was 
"indulging in press terrorism." 
  This was the president's answer to a document on regional 
economies disseminated by the UCR and information published by a 
Buenos Aires newspaper saying that the government was seeking to 
promote Navy officers accused of torturing French nuns. 
  The UCR "is again swallowed by a sea of contradictions," the 
president said, because at the same time UCR politicians were 
releasing the document criticizing the government, economists, 
including Ricardo Lopez Murphy, were asking it to increase the 
depth of the adjustment program and speed up things. 
  The UCR document says the economic plan "has increased the 
gap" separating the poor and "the economic model implies an 
irresponsible trust in the spontaneous market capacity to 
correct inequalities." 
  The head of state said the provinces "are not at a boiling 
point" even though some people "would like to create that type 
of climate." The president stressed that the provinces "will 
continue to receive the funds due them according to the 
co-participation program, without ruling out some type of 
additional help in emergencies." 
  Menem made these statements during an impromptu news 
conference at the Olivos residence today. 
  In an interview that appeared in today's issue of a Buenos 
Aires paper, Menem says the election of constituent delegates 
would take place, in principle, on 20 March. He added that his 
ideal running mate for 1995 would be Buenos Aires Governor 
Eduardo Duhalde. 
  The president said he favors a "limitless reelection" of 
presidents. He recognized, however, that the projected 
constitutional reform will only allow him to continue as 
president until 1999, that is, if he is reelected next year. 
  Menem expressed the wish, however, to run again in 2003. 
  "I am not Matusalen, but I can wait four years and then run 
again. I will be 73 by then and I will still be fit" to do it, 
Menem said. The president said he was sure he would be able to 
extend his mandate until 1999. 
  Menem minimized the importance of the chief of cabinet, a 
position that will be created with the reform, by saying that it 
"will not mean any reduction of presidential powers." 
  Menem did not mention any possible candidates to occupy that 
position but admitted that he already had a candidate "in mind." 
[preceding two words in Latin] 
  Menem said there are "indications" of the presence "of 
leftist militants such as MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] 
followers among the agitators that provoked the disorders in the 
northern part of the country." The president was referring to 
the incidents in Santiago del Estero. 
  The president said he favors increasing the number of 
ministries from eight to 12 when the new Constitution takes 
effect. Menem said the new portfolios might be Science and 
Technology, Environment, and Production. 
  Regarding the Senate discussion on the constitutional 
reform bill, Menem warned that if the bill is approved without 
reducing a senator's mandate to four years "it will have to 
return to the Chamber of Deputies for a revision." Menem 
admitted, however, that the issue "is no longer in the hands" of 
those who signed the pact: Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin. 
  "We will try to make it stick, but we cannot do anything 
else. A pact between political parties is important but it 
cannot go over congressional authority," the president 
emphasized. 
  Menem dismissed "the possible danger" of constituent 
delegates going beyond what was agreed with Alfonsin "as long as 
the essence of the pact is respected." 
  Regarding the crisis in the provinces, Menem reiterated the 
need for "a rational transformation," stressing that the private 
sector "will be able to absorb dismissed public servants even in 
the poorest districts such as Santiago del Estero or La Rioja." 
  In his renewed attack against the press, Menem said 
journalists "indulge in press terrorism" when commenting on a 
report published by the Buenos Aires newspaper PAGINA 12. The 
newspaper article said the government intended to promote Navy 
officers accused of having tortured French nuns. 
  "There are no chances of a promotion," the president said 
after characterizing the article as "a coarse lie" and an 
"aberration." 
  The new presidential attack against the press included the 
media that reported the government intended to build a 
"ring-side" [preceding word in English] over the destroyed 
Olivos mausoleum where the remains of Juan Peron and Eva Duarte 
used to lie. 
  "You can only doubt a journalist's honesty when he lies so 
shamelessly," Menem said, admitting that the issue "really upset 
him." 
  "On top of all that, CRONICA on 27 December used the 
information to build up a petty scandal based on something that 
is not true," the president stressed. 
  Menem said the report saying that he and UCR President Raul 
Alfonsin would campaign for the reform was "inaccurate." 
  The president categorically denied that groups of activists 
linked to Julio Cesar Araoz, former health and social action 
minister, had participated in the incidents in Santiago del 
Estero. 
  Menem accused legislators of acting "from behind curtains 
and 
at midnight" for including a 120 million peso increase for 
national universities that previously had been vetoed by the 
government in the 1994 budget. 
  "They did not take into account how that spending would be 
defrayed. They acted without thinking," Menem said, adding that 
the Federal Law on Education already includes a 20 percent 
increase for education in 1994. 
  The president also criticized the approval of the 120 
million 
pesos as "a strictly political and demagogic maneuver." 
  "Of course when we veto this type of legislation we are the 
bad guys and those who arbitrarily or carelessly included it in 
the budget end up receiving laurels and a crown," the president 
complained. 
  Menem said public employees who lose their jobs as a result 
of "transformations" in the public administration "will collect 
compensation and will be able to seek a more profitable job in 
the private sector." 
  "As long as we continue insisting on reducing production 
costs, what is called the Argentine cost, the possibilities for 
the establishment of new companies in Argentina, which is 
called, within quotes, poor, will increase," the president 
stressed. 
  Menem concluded by reiterating that he plans to meet with 
the 
governors, possibly at the Chapadmalal summer residence, 
"between 18 and 20 January."

  [Text] Some 48 hours after an armed uprising in Chiapas 
State, Mexico, there are 56 dead and 43 wounded. According to 
official reports, problems continue in the five municipalities 
occupied during the early hours of 1 January by the Zapatista 
Army of National Liberation. The occupied municipalities are: 
San Cristobal de las Casas, Chanal, Ocosingo, Altamirano, and 
Las Margaritas. EL TIEMPO, a Chiapas State newspaper, also 
reports that the Zapatists also control Guadalupe, (Tepeyac), 
(Ochuc), and Huixtan, towns which are located near the border 
with Guatemala. 
  According to official information gathered by PRENSA LATINA 
at the Chiapas State Attorney General's Office, the National 
Defense Secretariat and the government have reported that to 
date six soldiers, 24 policemen, 24 rebels, and two civilans 
have been killed. 
  PRENSA LATINA has provided a summary of all that has 
happened 
to date in Chiapas State. In San Cristobal de las Casas, the 
clashes between the Zapatista National Liberation Army and 
government troops have resulted in $1 million in damage. The 
rebels attacked a nearby jail and released more than 100 
prisoners. They also attacked a garrison. 
  Approximately 300 rebels habe placed Ocosingo under siege 
and 
it is reported that they have looted the town and committed rape. 
  Seven policemen were killed in Altamirano and two were 
wounded. 
  Las Margaritas townhall was occupied by 200 rebels who are 
demanding an end to poverty among the indians.

<F P=106> [Report by Julian Rodriguez Marin] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez (Mexico), 4 Jan (FE) -- The Army on 
Tuesday reinforced surveillance in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of 
Chiapas State, and recommended the people not leave the city in 
view of the lack of security prevailing in the area due to the 
actions by the Zapata National Liberation Army (EZLN). 
  The 120,000 residents of Tuxtla Gutierrez, located 680 km 
southeast of Mexico City, are nervous about the presence of the 
EZLN and they fear being involved in combat between the rebels 
and the Army. 
  At the military airport of Tuxtla Gutierrez, which is near 
the civilian airport, there have been approximately 20 
helicopters since the conflict first began last Saturday. The 
helicopters are moving troops to the area of conflict. The 
atmosphere on the city streets is tense and most of the 
residents prefer staying at home. The highways to San Cristobal 
de las Casas, one of the main centers of the conflict -- which 
is about 50 km from here -- are nearly deserted for fear of the 
firefights and the Army has set up checkpoints. 
  Rumors are circulating to the effect the soldiers and rebels 
are fighting just 10 km from Tuxtla Gutierrez. Other rumors say 
rebels have been seen near Chapa de Corzo, 15 km from Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, and that the guerrillas reportedly plan to storm the 
jail at Cerro Hueco, on the outskirts of Tuxtla Gutierrez. 
  Residents from Tuxtla Gutierrez told EFE that the majority 
of 
the people in this city reject the rebel actions, although there 
might be some support in the mountain area where the majority of 
the people are Indians. The people say there is little 
information on the clashes, radio communications are bad, and 
the situation is difficult in the rural areas where there are 
Indian chiefs. 
  A civilian source pointed out that in Las Margaritas, the 
Indian chiefs do not allow the Indians who work on farms to wear 
clothing similar to military uniforms as they fear being 
attacked. The source told EFE that the people in this area are 
extremely neglected and abandoned as the Indian chiefs are akin 
to feudal lords who manage the lives of the Indians and 
practically keep them as slaves. It is believed that there are 
areas in Chiapas where one Indian dies every day as a result of 
the violence generated by the Indian chiefs and the police 
forces, the source added. 
  In his New Year's message to the people of Chiapas, acting 
Governor Elmar Setzer said that "it is regrettable that the 
subversive groups have generated such actions of violence and 
vandalism that have broken the juridical order and disrupted the 
social peace and public harmony to which we are accustomed in 
Chiapas." He added that "these actions have been rejected by 
all sectors of the population, and various groups have called 
for a dialogue and a peaceful solution to the situation created 
by the armed aggressor group." 
  Setzer asked the people to be prudent and not be overcome by 
panic and rumors, and facilitate the work of the Army that seeks 
to reinforce protection and security in the affected areas.

  [Text] Armed confrontation between socialist Deputy Sorel 
Jacinthe and a group of opponents in Grand'Anse has left one 
person dead and two injured. The incident, which occurred on 31 
December at about 1100 PM in Mahotiere near Moron, erupted when 
the deputy, while participating in a dance, was taken to task by 
a group of opponents who were fired into action. The situation 
degenerated and came to blows. Deputy Jacinthe drew his gun and 
fired several shots. The young Rosemanette Jean-Louis, 16, candy 
seller, fell dead from a gunshot wound in the neck. Two other 
persons -- Celestin Lenet, 38, and Kettia Similien, 13 -- were 
also injured. We have learned from hospital sources that 
Celestin is in critical condition and will most likely not 
survive. 
  Pursued by his detractors, Deputy Jacinthe took refuge in 
the 
Moron barracks. He was then transferred to Jeremie on 1 January. 
He is allegedly under police protection at this time. A reliable 
source, however, told us that the deputy was to enter 
Port-au-Prince on the night of 3 January, but we have not yet 
been able to verify this information. 
  Signal is following the situation closely. As soon as we 
have 
further information, we will let you know.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- According to President Rafael 
Leonardo Callejas, General Luis Alonso Discua, head of the Armed 
Forces, is concerned about the results of the Human Rights 
Commission report. 
  President Callejas met yesterday with Discua, with whom he 
discussed the report, but did not give any details of the 
content of their discussion. 
  Callejas stated that he has been a loyal advocate of human 
rights in Honduras and said that the report should help 
reconcile Hondurans, because it lacks legal validity to identify 
any culprits. 
  Callejas said the document contains the facts, but attention 
must be given to the state's decisions in this regard, such as 
the court trials, the decisions issued, and the amnesties 
granted, which protect the rights of many people who have been 
identified as presumed culprits. 
  Callejas reiterated that the report should not be used to 
generate hatred and resentment among Hondurans or divisions. He 
said: "Rather, it should be the basis for the unification of 
Hondurans." 
  Callejas expressed his concern over certain statements that 
have been made in various media. According to Callejas, these 
statements seek to assign responsibilities based on assumptions, 
which is the sole responsibility of the courts. 
  Asked about if this was going to be a "let us start anew" 
incident, Callejas said that above all justice must prevail, but 
what is important is that everything leads to a national 
reconciliation. 
  Regarding the amnesties granted by his and Jose Azcona's 
government, Callejas clarified that they cover some of the 
crimes involving individuals that were included in the report. 
The rest will be up to the courts to decide but based on 
factual and concrete evidence. 
  Although Callejas supports the idea that justice must 
prevail, he believes that Hondurans should not be divided and 
that the report should seek mainly to reunify Hondurans. 
  Callejas believes that one cannot judge based on simple 
assumptions, but the courts should always have the last word. 
<H5>  Discua Maintains Firm Position </H5>
  When asked whether Discua's position could be jeopardized by 
the developments and certain problems within the armed 
institution, Callejas said he is unaware of such an extreme 
situation, adding "there has been no action shedding doubt on 
the legitimacy of the current Armed Forces commander." 
  Callejas said that it is absolutely illegal to call for 
Discua's temporary suspension from his post as requested by the 
Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras 
(Cofadeh). 
  The president added that this organization is not even close 
to being a court and that the Constitution of the Republic and 
other laws establish the procedure that should be followed in 
this case. 
  Callejas said that it is difficult for a request of this 
nature to prosper at the National Congress, adding that leaders 
of this branch of state already issued their opinions about this 
issue. 
<H5>  Oversight Commission </H5>
  The Executive Branch Oversight Commission has yet to issue 
its report, because it is still investigating the huge 
contraband discovered in San Pedro Sula. 
  Callejas said that the report will be revealed as soon as 
the 
investigations are concluded. The president added that he is 
awaiting a message in this regard from commission coordinator 
Israel Gonzales.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- The Supreme Court of Justice (CSJ) 
issued a statement yesterday ordering the country's judges to 
begin an investigation on the report issued recently by Leo 
Valladares, national human rights ombudsman, on missing 
individuals. 
  The report, the CSJ plenum stated, "notes the alleged 
participation of state officials and employees during the 1980 
to 1993 period when it accuses them and holds them allegedly 
responsible for the forced disappearance of national and foreign 
citizens and other human rights violations that took place in 
our country. This situation calls for a thorough investigation 
of the facts that are mentioned by the judges who are in charge 
of criminal matters. [no closing quotation mark as published] 
  Therefore, in using the legal powers invested upon it, the 
CSJ resolves: 

  -  First: To acknowledge receipt of the report on missing 
individuals in Honduras through the Secretariat of this 
Court. 
  -  Second: To create a special commission of prosecutors, 
headed by Prosecutor General Juan Arnaldo Hernandez, to review 
the documents contained in the report to b?gin the corresponding 
penal actions in the cases that warrant it. 
  -  Third: To allow the 
judges in charge of criminal matters, who know from where 
complaints have been filed regarding the disappearance of 
national and foreign citizens, to begin or continue, as 
appropriate, the corresponding procedures to punish the presumed 
human rights violators. The CJS Secretariat is to receive an 
authentic copy of the report and attached documents. 
  -  Fourth: To 
brief this resolution to CSJ General Prosecutor Hernandez and 
other judges in charge of criminal matters who know of where the 
reported incidents have taken place so that they can be informed 
and proceed. This resolution is to be implemented immediately.

talks will be resumed with the Guatemalan Government and Army in

<F P=106> [Report by Luis Ixablanque de Leon] </F>
  [Text] Willy Zapata, president of the Bank of Guatemala 
(Banguat), has announced that the country finally signed a new 
economic stabilization agreement with the IMF. 
  "Days ago we sent a message to this international 
organization in which Guatemala agrees to sign a shadow 
agreement [acuerdo sombra] (AS) that will enter into force on 1 
January 1994," he pointed out. 
  Zapata added that we are now only awaiting a faxed reply 
from 
IMF officials, expected to arrive in the next few days. This is 
imminent because it is part of agreements we reached in our most 
recent negotiations, he noted. 
  The official explained that the AS calls on the country to 
increase fiscal revenues by two percentage points through 0.5 
trimestral increases. "The goal is to increase the current 8 
percent tax collection [captacion de impuestos] rate to 10 
percent," Zapata said. 
  The Central Bank president added that the agreement also 
calls for an increase in the bank's net internal assets by 490 
million quetzals, as established by next year's monetary policy 
approved by the proper authorities this month. 
  "Another commitment by Guatemala is to keep inflation from 
going over 8.5 percent and to increase monetary reserves by $40 
million in 1994," Zapata pointed out. 
  IMF staff who visited the country in early November had 
initially proposed a monetary reserve increase of $160 million 
in 1994. 
  Complying with this requirement, however, would have 
prompted 
Banguat to issue more money without backing in order to acquire 
the respective foreign currency. 
  This would make it more difficult to decrease interest rates 
for open market operations to neutralize [esterilizar] the 
liquidity that is generated. As a result, it would be virtually 
impossible to reduce the current rate [tasa activa] of the 
financial system, now approximately 32 percent. 
<H5>  Signing Opens Doors </H5>
  Zapata added that the signing of this agreement makes it 
easier for Guatemala to obtain funds from other countries, such 
as the Advisory Group [Grupo Consultivo -- GC], which is 
comprised of nations from Latin America, Europe, and Asia. 
  "The World Bank has called a meeting, probably in Paris on 3 
March, in which Guatemala must present to the GC its package of 
projects for raising funds to implement these measures," he 
added. 
  The World Bank organizes activities like this to help a 
country that is initiating an agreement with the IMF, Zapata 
pointed out. 
  The bank president emphasized that "one of the best examples 
is El Salvador, which obtained donations [donaciones] totaling 
$60 million and a three-year term. We hope to obtain at least a 
similar figure, but our success will depend on the number of 
projects we present." 
<H5>  More Dollars for Guatemala </H5>
  He added that the signing of the AS allows the World Bank to 
disburse $25 million, which is the second installment of a $120 
million loan agreed upon in late 1992. 
  The first installment ($48 million) was disbursed to 
Guatemala in 1992, but the second installment was frozen because 
of the country's failure to comply with goals agreed upon with 
the IMF, mainly because of the May political crisis. 
  "Another credit available to Guatemala would be that of the 
Inter-American Development Bank for $132 million, and we hope 
that the first installment of $60 million will be disbursed in 
early 1994," Zapata said. 
  He added that "the only thing needed to receive this credit 
is congressional approval, as this would increase the country's 
foreign debt." 
<H5>  Certification of Good Conduct </H5>
  The AS has the same terms as the Stand by Precaution USS 
[preceding four words published in italics and in English] 
agreement signed by Guatemala in late 1992. The difference is 
that this one included a precautionary [precautorio] loan of 
$160 million that the signatory country may use should it face 
balance of payment problems. 
  But Guatemala never used this money. it did fail to meet the 
established goals mainly because of the May political crisis. 
  Finance Minister Richard Aitkenhead and the Bank of 
Guatemala 
president traveled to IMF headquarters in the second half of 
September to start talks that would lead to the signing of a new 
agreement with that international organization. 
  Finally, the country signed an AS -- which does not require 
congressional approval because it does not involve loans -- but 
according to Zapata there are plans for Guatemala to sign 
another standby agreement during the last trimester of 1994. 
  "That is our goal because a stand by agreement creates more 
international trust than an AS. The government program calls 
for the administration to work with a standby agreement during 
its second year in office," Zapata finally said.

  [Text] San Salvador, 4 Dec [as received] (ACAN-EFE) -- 
Today, Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani rejected reports 
that appeared in Washington related to U.S. pressure in 1984 on 
Roberto D'Aubuisson, deceased Arena [Nationalist Republican 
Alliance] leader, to deter possible attempts against then U.S. 
Ambassador Thomas Pickering. 
  Cristiani stated during a news conference that the reports 
that appeared in the 4 January edition of U.S. daily "THE 
WASHINGTON POST" which includes recently declassified documents 
on the past Salvadoran conflict, is based on "unconfirmed" 
information. 
  The U.S. newspaper pointed out that in May 1984 former 
President Ronald Reagan sent Vernon Walters, a veteran diplomat 
and former military officer, to meet with D'Aubuisson, founder 
of the government party Arena, to warn him that he would be held 
accountable for any attempt against Pickering. According to the 
newspaper report, Walters warned D'Aubuisson that any attack on 
Pickering, who had received threats from right-wing death squads 
"would result in all U.S. aid being terminated." 
  However Cristiani, although acknowledging that General 
Walters' visit to El Salvador had taken place, explained that it 
was to discuss issues related to selecting a provisional 
president as a result of the crisis taking place at the time. 
Alvaro Magana was finally selected as provisional president. 
He added that Walters met with the Major D'Aubuisson, who died 
in 1992, because as president of the National Assembly he was at 
the time one of the principal players in national politics and 
there was urgency to search for a person "agreeable to everyone 
to occupy the presidency while the constitution was being drawn 
up." 
  The Salvadoran president regretted that U.S newspapers 
published only "one-sided information" and added that he has 
documents declassified by the United States and he could also 
refer to the thousands of murders involving the former 
Salvadoran guerrillas. 
  Cristiani criticized an alleged propaganda campaign 
unleashed 
against Arena and emphasized that all the documents carry a 
warning heading to the effect that the U.S. State Department 
does not guarantee the accuracy of the information, and that it 
is simply information gathered by chance. 
  In November 1992, U.S. President Bill Clinton declassified a 
large number of confidential documents related to the Salvadoran 
conflict (1980-92) which has caused some controversy in El 
Salvador after being published in U.S newspapers.

  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani complained yesterday 
that U.S. newspapers only publish "unilateral reports" that 
adversely affect ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance], but 
they do not publish reports "on the thousands of murders 
committed" by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front 
(FMLN) during the war. 
  The president thus rejected reports published in Washington 
on alleged U.S. pressure exerted on the late ARENA leader 
Roberto d'Aubuisson in 1984 to prevent an attack on Thomas 
Pickering, who was serving as U.S. ambassador at the time. 
Cristiani added that a report appearing in the U.S. newspaper 
THE WASHINGTON POST, which cited official documents on the 
recent Salvadoran war that had been kept secret until recently, 
are based on "unconfirmed" information. 
  President Cristiani admitted that General Vernon Walters 
visited his country in 1984. He added, however, this was 
related to the selection of an acting president, who turned out 
to be Alvaro Magana, in view of the political crisis facing the 
country at that time. 
  He added that the U.S. soldier met with Major d'Aubuisson, 
who died in 1992, because he was among the most prominent local 
politicians in his capacity as president of the Constituent 
Assembly, and he added that "they were searching for a consensus 
person to occupy the Presidency while the Constitution was being 
drafted." 
  Cristiani said he has all the documents that the United 
States declassified, adding that he could list thousands of 
murders involving the FMLN, including that of Presidency 
Minister Dr. Antonio Rodriguez Porth in June 1989. 
  The president criticized an alleged propaganda campaign 
unleashed against his party. He said that all those documents 
bear a headline stating that the Department of State does not 
guarantee the veracity of the information and that this is 
simply information collected by chance. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton made public in November 1993 a 
large amount of secret information on the Salvadoran war 
(1980-92). Publication of this information in U.S. newspapers 
has already unleashed several polemics in El Salvador.

<F P=106> [From the "KL Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Defense Minister Colonel Humberto Corado and 
General Mario Rene Enriquez, Guatemalan defense minister, have 
examined in San Salvador issues related to the possible transfer 
of weapons of former Salvadoran guerrillas to Guatemalan rebel 
forces. 
  President Alfredo Cristiani has said that there is no 
concrete evidence on information disclosed by Guatemalan 
authorities related to weapons caches destined for Guatemalan 
guerrillas originating from El Salvador; he added, however, that 
the clues they have so far are quite convincing, and he 
expressed his concern for rising violence in Guatemala, where 
the last guerrilla group in Central America is still active. 
  In reference to the armed uprising that has been taking 
place 
during the past few days in Mexico--which is led by the peasant 
group the Zapatista National Liberation Army--Cristiani 
expressed his regret that even Mexico has a problem now. 
  We all wish that this type of problem did not exist and we 
are willing to cooperate with each other, the president added. 
  With respect to the events in Mexico, the Salvadoran 
president said that the participation of Central American 
nationals has not been confirmed; nevertheless, he announced 
that the issue would be examined together with Mexican 
authorities during an official visit. Cristiani did not disclose 
when the official visit to Mexico would take place.

  [Text] San Salvador, 4 Jan (AFP) -- Salvadoran President 
Alfredo Cristiani today said the former Salvadoran guerrillas 
still maintain weapons used during the past civil war, thereby 
violating the peace accords that call for the total destruction 
of war materiel belonging to the former rebels. 
  In a news conference, Cristiani declared: "I am convinced 
that nobody in his right mind could guarantee that the FMLN 
(Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front) has destroyed all of 
its weapons, because we all know this is not true." 
  Additionally, Cristiani revealed that the government has 
thousands of documents linking the FMLN to the assassination of 
rightist leaders and ideologists during the past decade, the 
responsibility of which was later denied by the former 
guerrillas. According to Cristiani, Presidency Minister Antonio 
Rodriguez Porth appeared to be one of those victims. He was 
killed nine days after the current government took office in 
June of 1989. 
  The Salvadoran president also stated that the UN Observers 
for El Salvador (Onusal) were kept informed of the existence of 
weapons and groups of former guerrillas who are still armed. 
  "They have had weapons in Nicaragua, and they have weapons 
in 
our country," insisted Cristiani, who did not give details on 
the alleged weapons still in the hands of former rebels. 
  In August of 1993, Onusal issued a communique proclaiming 
the 
total destruction of the FMLN arsenals, although it warned that 
there was a very good chance that weapons could turn up in the 
future in isolated cases.

  [Text] San Jose, 5 Jan (DPA) -- A Costa Rican group, which 
claims to be struggling to achieve the autonomy of Guanacaste 
Province, northern Costa Rica, has offered to send combatants to 
Mexico to support the actions of the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army (EZLN), a local newspaper reported today. 
  The newspaper EXTRA reported that the self-styled Autonomist 
Movement of Guanacaste for Bread, Work, and Dignity [Movimiento 
Autonomista de Guanacaste por Pan, Trabajo y Dignidad] has 
issued a communique stating that "we are at their disposal to 
send combatants." 
  Jose Antonio Korea, the group's information [divulgacion] 
secretary, said that the organization has been present in other 
struggles, such as those in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Panama. 
  He added that Guanacaste residents identify with those of 
Chiapas, where the EZLN has staged a rebellion, because the 
Mayas influenced the two cultures. 
  According to this leader, his group has "people ready" to be 
sent to fight in southern Mexico.

  [Text] San Jose, 5 Jan (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Benrd 
Niehaus said today the Costa Rican Government will not allow 
local groups to recruit men to reinforce the rebels who began a 
rebellion in southern Mexico on 1 January. 
  Niehaus downplayed the importance of an announcement 
released 
by the self-styled Autonomous Movement of Guanacaste for Bread, 
Work, and Dignity [Movimiento Autonomista de Guanacaste por Pan, 
Trabajo, y Dignidad], which said it was willing to recruit 
fighters to go to that country. 
  The foreign minister, remarking that the group is 
meaningless 
in Costa Rica, said "the statement lacks seriousness." 
  Nevertheless, he warned that if evidence should indicate 
that 
any Costa Rican organization is involved in plans to support the 
armed conflict in Mexico, the government will order the 
appropriate investigations.

newscast] 
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany has said that 
there is illegal trafficking of weapons through Panama en route 
to Colombia. The president made this statement at the Supreme 
Court, where he discussed government plans for 1994. According 
to the president, 1994 is a year in which much attention will be 
focused on the elections. He pointed out that the next 
president will have to face the challenge of reorganizing the 
government's program so that the country can be prepared to 
manage the interoceanic waterway once it is turned over to 
Panamania in 2000. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] These next five years will be 
crucial in Panamanian history. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Molirena [Nationalist Liberal 
Republican Movement] might leave the ruling alliance. Have you 
made the necessary changes? 
  [Endara] I will not get involved in political matters. I 
realize that what may occur in politics has repercussions inside 
my government, but I want it to have the minimum repercussion 
possible. 
  [Reporter] Will there be political amnesty this year? 
  [Endara] Political amnesty is granted by the Legislative 
Assembly, not me. 
  [Reporter] The Catholic Church is concerned about the large 
number of weapons on the streets in the hands of third parties. 
What can the government do about this prior to the elections? 
  [Endara] I am not aware of the Church's concerns in this 
regard. I believe there definitely is arms trafficking, but -- 
thank God -- according to intelligence reports, the weapons are 
only passing through Panama and do not stay here, at least not 
in large numbers. 
  [Reporter] Where are those weapons going? 
  [Endara] Usually to Colombia. [end recording] 
  President Endara also pointed out that he has no plans to 
grant amnesty to Colonel Eduardo Herrera. As for his 
administration, he pointed out that he has fulfilled his role in 
a transition government.

  [Text] Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, Arnulfist Party [PA] 
presidential hopeful, met this afternoon with President 
Guillermo Endara Galimany. They discussed the government 
alliance and its prospects for the presidential elections. PA 
members said their hopes to head the presidential ticket has 
strengthened. The issue of the alliance was discussed during a 
meeting held this afternoon at the Palace of the Herons between 
President Guillermo Endara Galimany and Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. 
  [Begin recording] [Moscoso de Gruber] We obviously talked 
about the government alliance. I told the president that the PA 
wants to maintain this alliance. I informed him we will soon 
talk to Molirena [Liberal Nationalist Republican Movement] so 
they decide whether they want to remain in this alliance with 
the PA or wish to abandon the alliance. 
  [Ortega] Would any other political group, such as 
Solidarity, 
join this alliance? 
  [Moscoso de Gruber] We have been talking to some parties. We 
have also spoken to Solidarity representatives, but I think they 
are waiting to see what will happen with the government 
alliance. So far we have only talked without reaching any 
special commitments. 
  [Ortega] It should be pointed out that [former Comptroller 
General] Ruben Dario Carles' presidential candidacy has been 
endorsed by Morena [National Renewal Movement]. To what degree 
does this pose an obstacle to your aspirations to be top leaders 
of the PA? 
  [Moscoso de Gruber] No, Morena has every right to nominate 
Mr. Carles for the presidency. We, the Arnulfists, are going to 
nominate our candidate on 23 January. It is no obstacle for us 
that Morena nominated Carles. 
  [Ortega] Finally, it has been learned some political parties 
have hidden weapons. How do Arnulfists view this? Do they feel 
threatened by this irregular situation? 
  [Moscoso de Gruber] It is regrettable that at this point it 
is said some political parties maintain weapons, which they will 
definitely use in the upcoming elections. It is regrettable 
they would try to disrupt peace in the next elections. We want 
the upcoming elections to be peaceful, although from what we 
said in April in the city of Boquete, I thought at that time 
that the next elections would not be peaceful. We believe 
Panamanians want peace, free elections, and to live in a 
democratic country. [end recording] 
  Mireya Moscoso de Gruber highlighted once more that she will 
not give up leading the presidential ticket. She also noted 
that once the campaign begins, her popularity and that of the PA 
will increase and the results of polls will change completely.

  [Text] The Chiriqui Province chapter of the National 
Renewal Party (Morena) yesterday nominated former Comptroller 
General Ruben Dario Carles as its presidential candidate for the 
8 May elections. 
  Referring to the National Police, Ruben Dario Carles said 
that 75 percent of its members are still the same as during the 
past regime, a situation that should have instituted a purge. 
He added that the task the Police Academy is performing must be 
encouraged. 
  In addition, Carles believes that it would take an entire 
afternoon, if one were to decide to prepare a list, to establish 
the exact number of government workers who claim to work despite 
low productivity levels. 
  The Morena presidential candidate said that during the next 
few days the other political parties that support his candidacy 
will make their respective announcements. Carles also said that 
he is unaware of what direction the parties that make up the 
ADOC [Civic Democratic Opposition Alliance] will follow. 
According to Carles, "I do not know where they are headed, but 
I do know I am going straight ahead." 
  Upon arriving in Chiriqui, the Morena candidate was cheered 
by a numerous crowd of well-wishers during his tour along 3 
November Avenue, the main commercial street in the City of David.

<F P=106> [Report by Francilino Diaz; from the "Telemetro Reports" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Ray Bishop, Local 907 Armed Forces Employees Union 
secretary, has challenged any firm or institution that operates 
in the Panama Canal reverted areas to prove that their workers 
do not favor either the permanence of the military bases in 
Panama or the candidacy of Ruben Dario Carles for president of 
the Republic. 
  [Begin Bishop recording] [Word indistinct] the sectors that 
disagree with the position held by the vast majority of the 
workers are precisely the managers who are also businessmen. I 
even challenge them.... [pauses, changes thought] We represent 
the workers of the military bases. We are answering for those 
workers, and 85 to 90 percent of them support the candidacy of 
Professor Ruben Dario Carles, not only because his political 
campaign is based on protecting jobs on the military bases but 
also because he is inclined to protect the positive economic 
revenues that enter our country due to those bases. [end 
recording] 
  Bishop said that the individuals who oppose these two issues 
want to divide the reverted areas among themselves and continue 
with the ongoing negligent attitude after the year 2000. 
  [Begin Bishop recording] This is the end of the line. Here, 
Panamanians as a whole must demand that the government that will 
take the helm of our country in 1994 effectively legislate in 
favor and to the benefit of the majority of Panamanians, not 
just a small group of businessmen and politicians. [end 
recording] 
  Bishop's recent statements in this same vein prompted 
several 
sectors to state that Local 907 cannot speak for all workers of 
the reverted areas. Bishop says, however, that those who oppose 
his views have never been interested in the needs of the 
Panamanian people. 
  [Begin Bishop recording] Together, let's try to restructure 
our country as Panamanians and, those who are elected in 1994, 
as public employees. [sentence as heard] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Communique signed by Colorado Party President Blas N. </F>
Riquelme] 
  [Text] Colorado Party supporters: 
  The Colorado Party that won the 1993 May elections has the 
political responsibility for the current government. 
  Therefore, the president of the Colorado Party is the 
natural 
party spokesman for its participation in government. 
  Bold actions by the president against the party as an 
institution have recently become public. 
  The events that seriously concern the party, which are 
detailed here, are the following: 
  1. The inconsiderate increase in basic public utilitiy 
rates, 
major public utilities rate increases, which violently hurt the 
humble Paraguayan people, whose interests are of undeniable 
priority for the party. 
  2. The massive, aggressive, and unjustified dismissal of 
public employees, such as in the cases of Capasa [Canas 
Paraguayas S.A.-- Paraguayan Liquor Inc.] -- the former Apal 
[Paraguayan Alcohol Administration] -- the Foreign Ministry, and 
others. 
  3. The president's unusual prohibition against ministers 
accepting invitations from the party president to come to party 
headquarters to coordinate issues related to the public good, 
based on the ideals of Colorado Party doctrine. 
  4. The president's complacent attitude toward the 
unconstitutionality of the law stripping military men and 
policemen of party membership, thus betraying the party's 
solidarity and the oath to observe and enforce the current 
Constitution. The party, by a resolution of its Executive 
Board, decided to ask the court to determine the 
unconstitutionality of the law in face of the president's lack 
of action to fully support the party members among the military 
and police. 
  5. During 1993 Antelco [National Telecommunications 
Administration] installed 12,000 new telephone lines and 
received 24 billion guaranies more income than in 1992. 
Spending was reduced by 25 billion guaranies with relation to 
1992. Profits increased from 8 billion guaranies in 1992 to 56 
billion guaranies in 1993, which represents a 700 percent 
increase. Antelco's domestic and foreign debt decreased by 13 
percent, and the amortization of the debt reached $42 million. 
Antelco currently has 11 billion guaranies in its coffers. 
Despite this positive situation its president and general 
administrator were unexplicably and abruptly fired by today's 
decree. 
  These events, in addition to others we are not listing for 
the time being, seriously offend the party as an institution. 
The party presidency is therefore forced to publicly denounce 
this situation in order to safeguard the high interests of 
Colorado Party supporters. 
  The president of the Colorado Party therefore declares: 
  1) His strong condemnation of the events listed here, which 
are harmful to the legitimate rights of the party that won the 9 
May 1993 elections. 
  2) His firm and unwavering decision to continue to struggle 
for the ideals of the glorious National Republican Association 
in order to preserve intact the dignity of Colorado Party 
supporters. His assertion that he will not subject himself to 
open or concealed pressures, wherever they may come from. 
  [signed] Blas N. Riquelme, president of the Colorado Party

  [Text] Miguel Angel Toma (PJ [Justicialist Party]), the 
Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee chairman, cast doubt on 
the possibility that Argentina would have a "lasting 
association" with the United States if the U.S. Government does 
not approve the sale of radars for the Douglas A-4M planes 
purchased by the Air Force. 
  Toma stressed: "The United States has an excellent chance to 
send an unmistakable signal, not only to Argentina, but to other 
Latin American countries that its call for integration and 
joining in is genuine and not mere words." 
  The Buenos Aires lawmaker expressed support for the sale of 
sophisticated U.S. radars requested by Argentina to equip the 
Douglas planes for training Air Force pilots. 
  In a press communique, the ruling-party deputy also deplored 
UK "pressures" to prevent this operation from materializing. 
Toma stressed: "The United States must choose between sending 
a concrete signal to Argentina on its decision to be reciprocal 
with us or, otherwise, continue bowing to British pressure and 
interests." 
  Toma warned: "There is no lasting association in which one 
partner alone has privileges." He expressed his hope that those 
who "still think like in Cold War times" will no longer sway the 
U.S. political "establishment." [preceding word in English]

<F P=106> [Article by Samuel Blixen] </F>
  [Text] The persistent and constant pressure exerted by the 
U.S. Federal Reserve on banks to discourage money laundering 
have resulted in the surfacing of substitute mechanisms to 
bypass control measures. 
  In our country's case, the State Department's repeated 
charges that our banking system has inherited the role played by 
Panama changed the mind of the banking authorities who refused 
to implement control mechanisms and lift bank secrecy. Thus, 
money-laundering operations through bank branches dropped 
noticeably (the latest cases made public involved the Santander 
and Lloyd's banks, linked to the Yomagate scandal [involving 
Argentine President Carlos Menem's sister-in-law]). The bank 
branches were replaced by some money exchanges on which U.S. 
organizations in charge of repressing illegal financial 
transactions focused their attention. 
  Money exchanges also were forced to operate more "openly" 
when the Central Bank of Uruguay extended some of the control 
mechanisms to this field. Once in a while the money exchanges 
appeared involved in money laundering, as in the recent case 
involving the Indumex [expansion unknown] money exchange, used 
to launder capital amassed in Brazil through a colossal 
corruption and influence peddling scheme. 
  However, the operators of ill-gotten money have had to find 
new discreet methods to launder their money in view of the risks 
they run due to the control measures implemented by DEA agents, 
the IRS (the office in charge of fighting tax evasion), and U.S. 
Customs. The freedom to carry out financial transactions in our 
country, in this sense, offers a new and flourishing mechanism: 
the surfacing of corporations engaged in intermediary 
activities. 
  Leaders of the banking union have just charged CADISA, 
Investment Management Company, Inc., one of the most important 
of these corporations in Uruguay, with money laundering. 
CADISA's trade is better known as Citicorp's "Citicarteras" 
[investments portfolio]. Citicorp, in turn, is the international 
corporation of the Uruguayan government's main creditor bank: 
Citibank. 
  If one believes banking sources, one could presume that 
Citibank, through Citicorp, has managed to complete the circle. 
CADISA's operations are considered a typical financial 
intermediary. It attracts savings that, in turn, are invested 
in banks operating in Uruguay with clauses in the contracts 
noting that all risks are run exclusively by the client. 
  This allows CADISA to carry out risky operations, depositing 
the money in saving accounts or buying "money baskets" in those 
banks that offer the best interest rates for investments. 
Citicarteras, preferably, operates with government-intervened 
private banks and the public banking sector, especially the 
Mortgage Bank. 
  It is estimated that Citicorp, during the 18 months it has 
been operating through CADISA, has accumulated $100 million 
worldwide. Many of its clients do not reside in Uruguay. 
  Citicarteras offers a high return in exchange for a 
commission. In addition to the rates -- which are an incentive 
despite the risk it represents -- there is another benefit: the 
full concealment of the operation because CADISA, not the 
client, deposits the money in the bank. In other words, the 
client enjoys complete secrecy, something that not even the 
banks enjoy. This is feasible because since CADISA is a 
corporation, although it carries out typical intermediary 
financial operations, it is not subject to Central Bank control 
measures. 
  This abnormal situation reported by the AEBU [Association of 
Uruguayan Bank Employees] still has not prompted a declaration 
by the Central Bank management. The subject was discussed 
recently but the Central Bank postponed any decision on the 
subject. Central Bank President Enrique Braga, through his 
public relations manager, declined to make any comments on the 
issue. 
  Union sources told BRECHA that the facilities Citicorp 
enjoys 
allow money laundering. Citicorp carries out similar activities 
in Argentina, where the National Securities Commission has 
sanctioned the holding [preceding world in English] "due to its 
dubious operations" and "irregularities in its activities." 
Citicorp in Argentina during the past two years has focused on 
the purchase of public enterprises earmarked for privatization 
and owns 28 percent of Cointel [expansion unknown] shares and 33 
percent of the Zapla Iron and Steel Industry in partnership with 
the Spanish Telephone Company and Techint [expansion unknown]. 
  The consulted sources asserted that CADISA's operations in 
Uruguay favor the strategy of Citibank, which currently has a 
dispute with the AEBU because it refuses to acknowledge the 
enforcement of the collective bargaining agreement valid for the 
entire industry. Citibank, on one hand, is trying to weaken the 
union and, on the other, to become the leader of the banks that 
belong to the Association of Banking Enterprises, which it left 
a few months ago. 
  CADISA operations are regarded as "unfair competition" by 
Citibank regarding the rest of the banking institutions. 
Citibank channels its financial intermediary activities through 
CADISA, which has significantly reduced costs. The case is 
quite unique: Citicarteras has no employees; its agents appear 
as a one-man enterprise. Nor do they collect salaries because 
they earn commissions and percentages that eliminate, among 
other things, the payment of contributions to the BPS [Social 
Security Bank]. 
  Labor union sources stated, however, that Citicarteras' 
financial intermediary operations imply a risk not mentioned in 
its advertisements: The corporation is not covered by bank 
secrecy and any judge, as well as the General Directorate of 
Taxation, can intervene the bank accounts. That is, as long as 
there is a desire to control what seems a profitable and almost 
perfect mechanism for money laundering.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry has released a document saying 
that Bolivian foreign policy with Chile and the United States 
will straighten up because the attitude of "reciprocal 
suspicion" will be replaced by an attitude of cooperation, 
exchange, and integration. 
  Just as the document says, these are changes that current 
Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar intends to implement and that 
will affect the traditional way Bolivia has faced and carried 
out the nation's foreign affairs. 
  This is one of the new Foreign Ministry conclusions provoked 
by the realization that "the world is going through a process of 
a general reorganization of relations between countries, 
regions, continents, and hemispheres." 
  The document says this period is characterized by a growing 
interdependence that "is not always free of asymmetrical 
situations that sometimes are quite contrasting" and usually are 
not mentioned. 
  The document says Bolivia must adopt, now and in the future, 
positions that have been proven successful recently and were 
based on peace policies implemented after World War II. 
  Aranibar's administration admits that since the recovery of 
democracy in 1982 the country has made "significant political 
and economic progress, which are determinant factors for 
Bolivia's insertion into the international community and reflect 
"an understanding of generalized trends." 
  The document points out that, consequently, the government's 
foreign policies are based on respect for the democratic system 
and human rights, preservation of and respect for the 
pluralistic identity of peoples, and the need for economic 
cooperation between nations. 
  These decisions have paved the way for "the logic of 
coalition and integration," replacing "the logic of 
confrontation. The latter being the basic tone that 
characterized "Bolivia's old international policy," which must 
be overcome. 
  The document also points out that the Foreign Ministry has 
embarked on the task of "professionalizing" its services in 
order to overcome "improvisations" as part of the new Foreign 
Ministry responsibility to help attract investments and 
establish beneficial trade agreements. 
  The document finally lists Foreign Ministry goals based on 
reality and "operational" possibilities as follows: 1) Give 
preference to relations with neighboring countries and the other 
Latin American and Caribbean nations and 2) Participate in the 
reconstruction of relations with the United States. 
  The third point refers to improving relations with the EC. 
The fourth and last point refers to national participation in 
subregional integration efforts, as well as in GATT and other 
international organizations. 
  The document cites the United States and Chile as areas of 
crucial problems for the country. It indicates that the "basic 
guidelines have the purpose of replacing the concept of 
'reciprocal suspicion' with a more cooperative concept and to 
diversify, with a true and advantageous number of issues, the 
possibilities for exchange and integration beyond the issues of 
drug trafficking and the landlocked problem, which have become 
real obsessions."

  [Text] La Paz, 4 Jan (EFE) -- Bolivian Vice President 
Victor Hugo Cardenas, of Aymara descent, today lamented the fact 
that indigenous peoples in Mexico had chosen the path of armed 
struggle, emphasizing that in Bolivia there will not be a 
similar situation because the government has begun to resolve 
the problems of indigenous peoples. 
  Of Bolivia's population of 6.4 million, 70 percent are of 
Aymara, Quechua, and Guarani descent, in addition to some 20 
Amazon tribes. Most of them live in poverty or in extreme 
poverty. 
  In 1993, international organizations considered that 
Bolivian 
peasants were the planet's poorest people. 
  "I lament the fact that in Mexico they decided to take up 
arms, but in Bolivia there will be no such movements because the 
demands from those sectors are being met, despite the fact that 
for many years they had been sidelined," the vice president said. 
  Cardenas added that "the exclusion of indigenous peoples is 
being overcome in Bolivia within the framework of the democratic 
system," noting that the government has taken major steps "to 
tackle indigenous people's problems," though he admitted that 
such steps "are not enough -- but it is important to begin, in 
order to find answers within the next few years." 
  The government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has 
announced that as of this year it will implement the "people's 
participation" program, which will be based on traditional 
institutions: the "ayllu" (indigenous community) and the "ayni" 
(mutual cooperative work, "today for you, tomorrow for me") in 
the areas of education and health. 
  The vice president emphasized that the work by the 
government 
"will leave them with no justification for violent action," 
adding that Bolivian democracy will also contribute to "avoiding 
the creation of radical indigenous movements." 
  Some movements of apparent indigenous origin have appeared 
in 
Bolivia over the past eight years, movements that have tried to 
vindicate -- through terrorism and attacks -- objectives such as 
social justice for indigenous people, but they were not 
supported by the people and were dismantled by the security 
organs of the state.

  [Text] La Paz, 5 Jan (EFE) -- Bolivian Social Development 
Minister Fernando Romero said today that the Indian rebellion in 
Mexico is "a voice of alarm" for Latin American governments. The 
minister admitted the possibility of a social explosion "in 
Bolivia and any other part of the world" if extreme poverty 
conditions persist. 
  Various indigenous and labor groups expressed support for 
the 
Mexican natives and charged that the IMF and World Bank were 
responsible for the misery afflicting most Latin American 
peoples. 
  The leaders of these associations criticized the declaration 
made by Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas, who ruled out the 
possibility that Bolivia might be affected by a situation 
similar to the Mexican rebellion. 
  The social development minister said: "Neglect has provoked 
this reaction (the Indian rebellion in Mexico) that, in my 
opinion, is a voice of alarm for all rulers who spend their time 
making rhetorical speeches and promises." 
  Romero, the official responsible for seeking solutions to 
the 
dramatic poverty afflicting a large percentage of the Bolivian 
population, said: "If we do not find effective and quick 
solutions, we might expect this type of social explosion in 
Bolivia and any other part of the world." 
  The Tupac Katari-1 Indian Movement (Mitka) of Kollasuyo 
(Bolivia) expressed its decision to give "moral and material" 
support to the Mexican Indians and asked the United Nations to 
intervene in order to prevent the further shedding of the blood 
of their "Zapatist brothers." 
  Another Mitka faction expressed "the duty to salute and wish 
all the necessary success" to the actions leading to a victory 
in the Chiapas' struggle and the expulsion of the "invaders" who 
usurped native peoples's rights. 
  Hilarion Mamani, a leader of the El Alto Labor Federation, 
said the exploitation suffered by Bolivian peasants could 
provoke something similar to what happened in Mexico. 
  What happened in Chiapas is the result of poverty, Mamani 
said, accusing the World Bank and the IMF of provoking the 
misery afflicting a large part of Latin American populations. 
"It is a warning for them to change their policies against the 
impoverished nations of this continent," Mamani said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Roberto Magalhaes, PFL-PE, Liberal </F>
Front Party-Pernambuco, Congressional Investigating Committee, 
CPI, rapporteur, by Marcelo de Moraes in Brasilia; date not 
given] 
  [Text] [De Moraes] Deputy Roberto Magalhaes' patience is on 
the verge of exhaustion. Annoyed at seeing how congressmen have 
manipulated the national budget over the past few years, the 
rapporteur of the CPI that is investigating the budget mafia has 
pledged to include in his report all those whose involvement in 
corrupt practices has been duly proven. 
  The effort of examining all the documents has consumed 
Magalhaes' time and health. He wants to submit his report by 15 
January and has been working day and night drafting the report. 
Not even the bad cold he caught last week made him slacken up a 
little. He said: It does not matter if I am running a 
temperature or am sick. The CPI cannot come to a grinding halt. 
  Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive Renewal 
Party-Para] follows in Magalhaes' footsteps. He went to 
Congress to work as usual yesterday. Both Passarinho and 
Magalhaes know the public demand great responsibility from the 
CPI. 
  Even though he did not want to preannounce the names of 
congressmen whose removal he will recommend, Magalhaes made it 
clear that Senator Ronaldo Aragao (PMDB-RO) [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party-Roraima] and Deputy Carlos Benevides 
(PMDB-CE) [Ceara], who made a deposition this past week, will be 
on the list. Furthermore, those congressmen who are sure to 
appear in the report include Deputies Joao Alves (no party-BA) 
[Bahia], Cid Carvalho (PMDB-MA) [Maranhao], Manoel Moreira 
(PMDB-SP) [Sao Paulo], Jose Geraldo Ribeiro (PMDB-MG] [Minas 
Gerais], Genebaldo Correia (PMDB-BA), Fabio Raunheitti (PTB-RJ) 
[Brazilian Labor Party-Rio de Janeiro], and Joao de Deus Antunes 
(PPR-RS) [Rio Grande do Sul]. Feres Nader (PTB-RJ), a 
substitute member, will also appear. The following congressmen 
may also be on the list: Ibsen Pinheiro (PMDB-RS), Ricardo Fiuza 
(PFL-PE), Sergio Guerra (PSB-PE) [Brazilian Socialist Party], 
Jose Carlos Vasconcellos (PRN-PE) [National Reconstruction 
Party], Paes Landim (PFL-PI) [Piaui], Flavio Derzi (PP-MS) 
[Popular Party-Mato Grosso do Sul], and Raquel Candido (PTB-RO). 
  The CPI probe into the budget mafia is drawing to an end. In 
your capacity as CPI rapporteur, how do you feel at his moment? 
  [Magalhaes] I am becoming terribly indignant at what I 
consider very serious cases. There have been incredible and 
long-standing manipulations of the national budget. There was a 
huge irregular scheme afoot within the Budget Committee. These 
cases are most grave. I can no longer stand to see all this. 
  [De Moraes] What impression did Senator Aragao's deposition 
create on you? 
  [Magalhaes] Just to put you in the picture, a senator 
manages 
to get appropriations amounting to $600,000 for a foundation 
that bears his name and is located in Rondonia. I think that 
more than half the congressmen have never had assets of a 
comparable value. He used some of that money to buy three 
ambulances from a company he established and the vehicles are 
conspicuous by their absence. And so the story continues. 
  [De Moraes] Did the deposition of Deputy Carlos Benevides 
also irritate you? 
  [Magalhaes] That is another incredible case. An individual 
chose 54 institutions that now receive social contributions and 
manages to obtain the minister's okay without any problems. I 
repeat, I can no longer stomach this type of thing. 
  [De Moraes] Is your report ready? 
  [Magalhaes] I am about to conclude it. Yesterday I received 
a detailed report from Senator Eduardo Suplicy [PT-SP] [Workers 
Party], which will help me draft my document. I am waiting for 
more depositions, but all those involved in irregularities whose 
guilt is established by the CPI beyond all doubt will be 
included in the report. 
  [De Moraes] There are those who are in favor of postponing 
the deadline for the Budget CPI to conclude its findings. Do 
you endorse this? 
  [Magalhaes] No. I am against postponing it. I have already 
discussed this with Senator Jose Paulo Bisol [PSB-RS] and 
explained to him that it would not be possible. There is a 
group that wants to delay the deadline for the CPI to submit its 
final report, but we cannot go beyond 15 January. If we do 
that, the work of the CPI will go unnoticed. 
  [De Moraes] Do you not believe that if the deadline were to 
be extended the CPI may discover new things? 
  [Magalhaes] Now is the time to reach a conclusion. We can 
investigate new allegations later. We must meet the deadline 
established for the CPI report, otherwise these investigations 
could go on for another six years. 
  [De Moraes] Do you believe your report will herald a new era 
for Brazilian politics? 
  [Magalhaes] I do not think my report will, but I have no 
doubt whatsoever that the decision taken by a plenary session of 
Congress will.

<F P=106> [From the "CMI Television" newscast] </F>
  [Text] CMI has discovered the presence of another U.S. 
battalion in Colombia. It is in Puerto Lopez, Meta Department, 
and is apparently building a base to help fight drug production. 
Meanwhile, Marines arrived at Malaga Bay in Valle del Cauca. 
  Although it is rumored in certain sectors that the reason 
for 
their presence here is to pressure the Cali Cartel to surrender 
and build a radar and communications center, today--in full view 
of local residents and tourists--the North Americans began their 
construction of a school and a road in Juanchaco, social 
projects that they say will help the people. They brought all 
types of vehicles, construction equipment, bulldozers, and 
barges to produce electricity. If their instructions were to 
hide why they are here, their behavior showed the opposite. The 
environment today was normal, although they were prohibited from 
talking to the media. Some local residents welcome the Marines 
with open arms: 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] They are welcomed, 
because if they come to Juanchaco to build projects for the good 
of the community and we reject them, other locations will be 
asking for them with open arms. [end recording] 
  Others question their presence here: 
  [Begin second unidentified speaker recording] We have not 
heard the government, the mayor's office, or the governor's 
office clearly tell us what they are going to do. [end 
recording] 
  The presence of U.S. troops in Colombia is nothing new. Five 
months ago CMI was with the U.S. Armed Forces in San Jose del 
Guaviare, where they built an operations base for the river 
force of the Colombian Navy in an area where there are many 
guerrillas and drug traffickers. 
  As if this was not enough, the residents of Puerto Lopez, 
Meta, have also reported the presence of U.S. soldiers. They 
are apparently there to build--jointly with the Colombian 
Navy--what might be an operations center in that area, where 
drug-trafficking activity has been detected. 
  [Begin recording] [Puerto Lopez Mayor Hernan Saavedra] We 
have learned that U.S. Navy personnel are building a naval base 
for the Colombian Navy in the jurisdiction of Puerto Lopez. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Are they armed? 
  [Third unidentified speaker] Of course. Each one is armed 
with at least their regulation weapon. 
  [Fourth unidentified speaker] They have been seen armed like 
any officer with his pistol on the side. 
  [Fifth unidentified speaker] I at least disagree with the 
government's decision to permit those gentlemen to come here to 
our territory, because we do not know what their mission is. 
[end recording]

  [Excerpts] Jean-Claude Martino, spokesman for President 
Aristide, announced on 4 January that the 15 January conference 
would essentially turn on the question of refugees. The 
political crisis talks also will tackle the problem of a massive 
exodus of Haitians. It is difficult today to prevent desperate 
Haitians from going aboard on flimsy boats in order to reach the 
coasts of Florida. 
  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide demands the departure of 
the 
military officials before the designation of a new prime 
minister, his new spokesman Jean-Claude Martino said. During a 
statement in Creole on the Voice of America, Martino recalled 
the obstacles faced by the government of resigning Prime 
Minister Robert Malval, a government which could not function. 
As long as those obstacles are not removed, you can appoint 
another thousand governments; they will not be able to function, 
because those who prevent them (?form) an illegal government of 
dictatorship that fears neither God nor man and that has no 
other program than to kill Haitians and to make money, Martino 
said. 
  Several Haitian parties, including the National Congress of 
Democratic Movements, which is one of the two rival branches of 
Haitian socialism and which favors Father Aristide, have 
demanded recently the quick appointment of a new prime minister 
by Mr. Aristide so as to get the country out of the crisis. 
[passage omitted] 
  The U.S. State Department has let it be understood that the 
question of governing the country will have to be resolved 
before tackling the refugee problem. The State Department has 
coldly reacted to the idea of a conference on the problem of 
refugees on 15 January.

  [Excerpts] The latest message to the nation from the 
president-in-exile is the object of comment, notably in 
Parliament. The watch words "mobilization iron cuts iron" were 
launched by Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who maintains the hope of 
returning. 
  Deputy Evans Beaubrun thinks that the president-in-exile 
fluffed his entrance into the new year. The legislator 
interprets President Aristide's statements as a sort of 
convocation to civil war. He hopes that the population rejects 
this proposal of indian wrestling, just as they reject a 
solution of a clean sweep advocated by other sectors. The year 
1994 is the year for compromise, according to Deputy 
Beaubrun.[passage omitted] 
  Another legislator, close to the National Front For Change 
and Democracy [FNCD], interprets differently the statements made 
by the president on 1 January. Isaac Garcon, from FNCD, sees 
the message as an encouragement to the people in order to keep 
them mobilized in favor of democracy. [Passage omitted] Mayor 
Evans Paul also reads differently the watch-words "iron cuts 
iron": [Begin Paul recording in Creole] I do not know what the 
president meant by "iron cuts iron," but I know, considering the 
framework of democracy in the country, iron also could mean the 
Constitution. Iron also could mean the law, respect for 
democratic principles that we have always defended. I do not 
want people to interpret the word iron as violence because the 
president always speaks in images. For someone who always 
respects principles, the law, the Constitution is iron. [end 
recording].

  [Text] Lima, 4 Jan (EFE) -- The government has "invited to 
pass into retirement" nine generals of the Peruvian National 
Police [PNP] in a surprise decision that some news media have 
regarded as a new "purge" of that institution. 
  The generals discharged from duty owing to a "reshuffling of 
structures" had less than 35 years in service, and their ages 
would allow them to remain on duty, the daily LA REPUBLICA 
reported on Tuesday, 4 January. 
  The alleged "purged" generals are Roger Alvitez, Edgar 
Sullca, Eusebio Bedoya, Rodolfo Enceles, Hector Escobar, Jesus 
Sanchez, Ernesto Arenas, Cirilio Pacheco, and Ramiro Berrantes. 
  All of them had been scheduled to attend a public tribute 
given in their honor by the PNP but did not attend, apparently 
unhappy with the government decision.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Extension of the Mandate of the Disciplinary </F>
Board for Magistrates"] 
  [Text] After a lengthy debate during which members of the 
governing majority upheld different viewpoints, the Democratic 
Constituent Congress [CCD] approved a law that is very important 
for restoring normalcy to the Judicial Branch. 
  This law, of a constitutional nature, extends the mandate 
and 
power of the Disciplinary Board for Magistrates [JHM] beyond the 
implementation of the new Constitution approved by referendum. 
  The law, which also represents a vote of confidence in the 
five JHM members for the outstanding job they have done so far 
despite a series of limitations, modifies the previous 
legislation in this respect; that is, in referring to the 
creation of this body as well as that vetoed by the President of 
the Republic which, although it had the same purpose, did not 
have constitutional validity. 
  The scope of the new law will from now on, therefore, allow 
the JHM to definitely appoint the 18 Supreme Court justices, the 
250 Appellate Court justices, and the 750 magistrates, including 
lower court and provincial judges. 
  The new law also establishes that the JHM will terminate its 
functions once the National Council of Magistrates is 
established. This will entail a lengthy process, at least 18 
months, until its seven members are elected. 
  Obviously this is too much time to wait to begin the process 
of normalizing a state branch in which more than two-thirds of 
its officials are in their posts only provisionally, since the 
democratic institutions were dismantled on 5 April 1992. 
  In practice, this means complete functional and individual 
instability without any support or guarantees regarding the 
government. 
  This reveals an urgent need for the normalization of the 
Judicial Branch, whose utmost expression should not only be one 
of full independence, but also of absolute equality in relation 
to the other state branches. 
  For this and other reasons, we pointed out a few days ago in 
this same column the need for a transitory solution, such as the 
one just approved: "...the appropriate path that should be 
taken is to grant the JHM a law, approved by Congress, which is 
broad and explicit enough to allow this body -- composed of 
exemplary lawyers -- to on this single occasion handle the 
problem that has surfaced by officially appointing the great 
majority of the judges currently on duty." 
  Moreover, our judicial branch's many vices and defects -- 
which, it should be pointed out, have not been corrected, and 
have probably been made even worse by the circumstances -- have 
perhaps their worst expression in its absolute submission to the 
other branches, especially the Executive Branch, which under 
circumstances such as the current ones is implacable with 
magistrates who are not subservient. 
  The problem is particularly serious as in the coming months 
the country is expecting a series of important cases to be heard 
by the Judicial Branch. Its reform, therefore, as well as the 
reform of the Attorney General's Office, must not only be 
complete and definitive, but also carried out as soon as 
possible. 
  Aside from the basic aspects of the restoration of national 
institutionality, there are also some details of a practical 
nature. As we had noted previously, neither Peruvian citizens 
nor foreign investors have guarantees for their transactions in 
a juridically unstable country, "where the full autonomy and 
separation of the public branches is not freely exercised."

  [Text] After a heated debate and a few amendments to the 
original text, the Constituent Congress on 20 December 
unanimously approved the Defense and Internal Order Committee's 
resolution creating the National Registry of Detainees, 
Defendants, and Inmates [Registro Nacional de Detenidos, 
Procesados, y Recluidos]. 
  The resolution -- based on a draft bill submitted by 
legislator Pedro Garcia Saavedra (NM-C90 [Change 90-New Majority 
Faction]) -- is divided into seven articles and three final and 
transitory clauses. 
  The first article establishes that the registry will have an 
updated data base that will make it possible to identify and 
place the people arrested by Armed Forces and National Police 
members and by court order. 
  Moreover, it is intended to adequately accompany all the 
steps of the legal process involving people subject to judicial 
investigation, including their imprisonment. 
  The resolution states that the Attorney General's Office, 
which will be in charge of appointing the registry's executive 
director, is charged with organizing and administrating the 
registry. 
  The second article states that the Interior and Defense 
Ministries, the Judicial Branch, and the National Prisons 
Institute will supply all the information required by the 
registry regarding detentions, investigations, and imprisonments. 
  The third article states that any individual or institution 
has free access to the information contained in the registry. 
  According to the approved text, a coordinating committee of 
the registry also is created. This committee will comprise two 
representatives from the Attorney General's Office -- one of 
whom will preside over the committee, and one representative 
each from the Justice, Interior, and Defense Ministries. 
  The committee also will include a representative from the 
judicial branch and from the congressional Human Rights 
Committee. 
  In its first transitory clause, the document states that the 
first stage of the registry will include information on 
individuals arrested on charges of terrorism and treason against 
the fatherland, the state, and the national defense. 
  Finally, it is stated that the guidelines contained in the 
letter of understanding signed on 23 January 1992 by the 
Attorney General's Office, the Interior Ministry, AID, and the 
Latin American Institute for Crime Prevention and Treatment of 
Offenders will be followed in creating the registry.

<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez from the "Research Unit"] </F>
  [Text] Peruvian Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera, alias 
"Vaticano," and Colombian Waldo Simeon Vargas Arias, alias "El 
Ministro" -- two of the greatest drug traffickers in the country 
-- have held a top-level meeting seeking to end confrontation 
between their two groups and to set the basis for a possible 
initial agreement to organize the first Peruvian drug cartel, 
Colombian style. 
  National Police Antinarcotics Board sources have said that 
these two criminals are responsible for 60 percent of the drugs 
that are sent to Colombia for direct distribution by the Cali 
Cartel. 
  The meeting was held during the end of September, supposedly 
on the Colombian border, following an extended dispute initiated 
by "Vaticano," who tried to remove his competitor from the 
extensive coca territory he dominates between Pongo Isla, San 
Martin Province, Department of San Martin, and Lagunas, Upper 
Amazonas Province, Loreto Department. 
  The Peruvian trafficker handles the main drug operations in 
the Upper Huallaga, namely in Aguaytia, Sion, Saposoa, and 
Campanilla, San Martin Department. 
  The substantial difference between the two, according to 
U.S. 
Embassy antinarcotics officers, is that "El Ministro" is one of 
the greatest buyers of cocaine paste while "Vaticano" is fully 
occupied transporting drugs to Colombia. 
  The same sources reported that both are independent, but 
work 
directly with the Cali Cartel, headed by the brothers Gilberto 
and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela. 
  Skirmishes between the two mafia bosses reportedly began on 
the orders of "El Ministro," who wanted to pay less for the drug 
than the high price paid by "Vaticano" in his area of influence. 
  The Peruvian established a price of $800 per kg of cocaine 
paste, while the Colombian was offering only $600, and this 
enabled him to purchase larger quantities. 
  But the coca producing peasants began to sell to "El 
Ministro" in spite of the lower price he was offering because 
transporting the drugs to the distant places where "Vaticano" 
purchases the drug by speedboats represented additional cost and 
risk due to the presence of security forces which have increased 
control in the zone dominated by the Peruvian drug organization. 
  The confrontation became more heated due to the growth of 
"El 
Ministro's" business who, from being a purchaser, began to work 
in the most profitable business of shipping large amounts of 
drugs, thus poaching on "Vaticano's" turf of transporting the 
paste abroad. 
  "El Ministro" was becoming "Vaticano's" most dangerous 
competitor when the latter, from El Sauce where he had 
established his general headquarters, moved to Pampa Hermosa, 
Upper Amazonas Province, Loreto Department. 
  In El Sauce, where there is an important landing strip, "El 
Ministro" joined the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, MRTA, 
to obtain their protection. When the Army moved in, the 
trafficker tried to bribe the head of the detachment, an officer 
known as "Juan Pablo," but even so the trafficker and the 
subversives were expelled from the ares. 
  The Colombian has a very good nose for the drug business. He 
began early in the 1980's as a "mule" of the Medellin Cartel 
branch in Leticia, Colombia, which was headed by Evaristo Porras 
Ardila, but immediately began his own business. He found that 
coca plantations were increasing considerably in the provinces 
of Upper Amazonas, Loreto, and San Martin, San Martin Department. 
  Coca plantations increased considerably because of the 
migration of colonizers and peasants who, coming from the Upper 
Huallaga, were forced to leave their coca plantations because of 
the National Police antinarcotics units. 
  The cocaine paste tablets produced by the peasants of 
Shanusi, Alfonso Ugarte, Yumbatos, Jorge Chavez, Shapajilla, 
Bonilla, Sargento Lores, Pintoyacu, Copal, Carachama, San Juan, 
San Miguel, Naranjal, Davilsillo, Nuevo Lamas, and 
Pintoyaquillo, were taken to Pampa Hermosa, San Martin Province, 
Upper Huallaga, the main collection center for the region. 
  But the clandestine airport between km 40, by the bridge 
over 
the Shanusi River, and Pampa Hermosa was destroyed by the Air 
Force. 
  This incursion prompted an increase in the security forces, 
preventing the normal flow of drug flights to Colombia. 
  "El Ministro" then moved from the depleted market of Pampa 
Hermosa to Huimbayoc, his new drug collection center. He made 
Pongo Isla his general headquarters and Yarina his center of 
operations because it has an airport with official permit. In 
this area the people do not have the money even to move around 
in boats, but there are air-taxi companies that render services 
to that town. 
  Pongo Isla then was renamed Leticia by the Colombian 
trafficker, in honor of the people from his country where Porras 
Ardila taught him the art of drug trafficking. 
  By making Huimbayoc his collection center, "El Ministro" 
recovered the power he lost by abandoning Pampa Hermosa. He now 
purchases coca paste from the peasants of Pucalpillo, Progreso, 
Miraflores, Paraiso, Yarina, Navarro, Reforma, Inayuca, Alto 
Coritayacu, Dos de Mayo, Santa Marta, San Francisco, Santa Zona 
Matador, San Antonio, Guineayoc, and others. 
  An unexpected event stopped "El Ministro's" dangerous bull 
run. On 15 May, a group of agents from the National Police 
Command from Upper Amazonas, Yurimaguas, entered his operations 
center in Pongo Isla and arrested him, his girlfriend Isolina 
Mansilla Acosta, alias "Charito," and two of his henchmen. 
  "El Ministro" was taken aboard his own boat to Yurimaguas 
where in a matter of hours he reached an agreement with his 
captors: He paid $100,000 for his freedom. 
  After lengthy investigations by the National Police 
Inspector's office and by the Antinarcotics Board with the 
cooperation of the Upper Amazonas Provincial Control Department, 
the bribed policemen were jailed, fired, and are currently 
facing trial. 
  The Colombian continued his business following this sudden 
fright but convinced peasant defense patrol members from coca 
production districts like Huimbayoc and Navarro to provide him 
with protection. 
  So much so, that when a National Police antidrug patrol 
arrived in Huimbayoc on 16 August, the peasant defense patrol 
members welcomed the security forces, who arrived by helicopter, 
with gunfire. 
  Two members of the defense patrols died in the shootout and 
97 kg of cocaine paste and large amount of chemical precursors 
were seized. But Isolina Mansilla Acosta, alias "Charito," 
daringly accused police agents of attacking private property and 
of murdering peasant defense patrol members. 
  Ironically, the peasant defense patrols were provided with 
weapons by the Huallaga Front headed by Peruvian Army General 
Eduardo Bellido Mora. Dinandro [Antidrug Division] Report No. 
162-DADAH-SL, dated 10 August that is, six days before the 
police incursion states: "(Waldo Simeon Vargas Arias) is 
reportedly living in Huimbayoc and Navarro, Tarapoto Province, 
San Martin Department. He would be living with Isolina Mansilla 
Acosta. They purchase large amounts of drugs, approximately 10 
tonnes, to be processed and transported aboard clandestine 
planes to Colombia." 
  The report adds: "The traffickers reportedly rely on the 
support of townspeople and peasant defense patrol members to 
provide them with security in all their activities, using long- 
and short-range weapons." 
  A high-ranking Dinandro source has confirmed the 
intelligence 
report obtained by his agents concerning the support to 
traffickers by some peasant defense patrols who were armed by 
the Army. 
  The source said: "Like in Upper Huallaga, the traffickers 
want to lead the people against the security forces. They have 
achieved this to a certain extent," adding: "For this reason, 
there must be better control of the peasant defense patrols, 
especially those that received weapons from the state." 
  As if the police action were not enough, "El Ministro" 
received an unexpected attack from "Vaticano's" Pongo Isla 
fortress. He was forced to flee, leaving on the road two of his 
henchmen who murdered by "Vaticano's" group. 
  The Colombian then settled in Pelejo, another collection 
center with a clandestine airport and surrounded by coca 
plantations cared by the people of Papaplaya, Rumiyarina, San 
Luis, Santa Elena, Asuncion, Caimito, Pamplona, Pelejillo, and 
mainly Reforma. 
  After no more than a month in Pelejo, another incursion by 
"Vaticano" forced him to move further north, to Lagunas, yet 
another trafficking stronghold. 
  But "El Ministro" is no fool. He knew his competitor was on 
his heels and, before leaving Huimbayoc, he left the brothers 
Carlos Enrique and Miguel Angel Farro Perez to run the business 
in Lagunas. The first task was to refurbish the run-down Lagunas 
municipal airport to transport the drugs. 
  When the Colombian arrived in Lagunas everything was ready. 
The Farro Perez brothers had signed an agreement with the 
municipality of Lagunas to repair the airport in exchange for 
installing a branch of the Halcon aero-taxi company. Once the 
airstrip became operational the sleepy jungle district was 
revived because of the traffickers' flights. 
  "El Ministro" knew the Farro Perez brothers would not fail 
him because, among other things, they are his relatives. 
  The Colombian drug trafficker's girlfriend, Isolina Mansilla 
Acosta, was born in Rupa Rupa, Huanuco, on 3 June 1959. She is 
the sister of Sara who is the wife of Enrique Farro Perez, the 
Halcon aero-taxi representative in Lagunas. But that is another 
story. 
  A Dinandro intelligence report dated August 1993 states that 
the Colombian gang involved in "the exploitation of cocaine 
paste for international trading" includes "Isolina Mansilla 
Acosta and the individuals known as `Gatillo,' `Nacional,' 
`Caballo,' `Lancero,' `Montana,' `Gorgojo,' `Memo,' `Boquita,' 
`Tiburon,' `Dangelo,' `Miguel,' `Ventiuno,' `Balde,' `Cone,' and 
`Sierrita.'" 
  Also mentioned in the report are "`Gato,' `Tony,' `Dios 
Mio,' 
`Cocharun,' `Brea,' `Canillita,' `Lucho Buho,' `Juanito,' 
`Harry,' `David,' `Negro Izula,' `Micky Martin,' `Chino,' `Don 
Marcos,' `Hueso,' `Frejolito,' `Comadre,' `Pirulin' (who is 
known as one of the most blood thirsty Colombian hired killers 
in the zone), `Chevas,' `Pizana,' `Pelbes,' `Ripio,' `Jazmin,' 
`High Mariel,' `Burro,' `Elastico,' `Mascara,' `Lambayecano,' 
`Chocho,' `Coro,' `Percy,' `El Popular Coco,' `Percy,' `Coro,' 
`Marcos,' and `El Ciego.'" 
  When "El Ministro" arrived in Lagunas he found the airport 
ready to transport the drug elaborated by coca producers in 
Shambuyacu, Tiphisca, Miraflores, Santa Cruz, Providencia, 
Pucate, Naranjal, and other neighboring areas. 
  Following this recovery by "El Ministro," the Peruvian 
citizen "Vaticano" could do nothing but close an agreement and 
yield to the pressures of his Colombian bosses. 
  A report compiled in Lagunas said that a light plane with a 
Colombian license number landed at the recently repaired 
airstrip around 1800 during the middle of September. The plane 
carried the pilot and one passenger, whom some people identified 
as "El Ministro's" brother. The individual carried a message 
from the Cali Cartel: Waldo Vargas Arias had to negotiate with 
Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera to avoid threatening the drug supply. 
  From that date "Vaticano" was unable to touch the 
Colombian's 
business between Pongo Island and Lagunas while "El Ministro" 
would not buy drugs in Campanilla, Saposoa, Aguaytia, and Sion, 
which are the Peruvian areas of influence. 
  At the same time it was agreed that "El Ministro" would 
continue to operate more as a drug collector than drug 
transporter. 
  In exchange the "Vaticano" allowed "El Ministro" to contact 
Shining Path leaders in Upper Huallaga to hire their protection 
following disappearance of the MRTA from the area. 
  For the two drug traffickers, this was an agreement for the 
equal distribution of business. No one knows how long it will 
last because "El Ministro" becomes stronger every day and 
threatens to remove "Vaticano." 
  In light of the actions by the antinarcotics forces, the two 
drug traffickers may join forces to establish a stronger 
organization with a unified command and an army of hired killers 
like the Colombian cartels. 
  To confirm if the agreement is being fulfilled, "Vaticano" 
sent two of his hired Colombian killers -- "Chuck Norris" and 
"Rambo" -- to the area under the control of "El Ministro." They 
periodically report to him details of the movements of his 
competitor. 
  The first Shining Path flags appeared in Puente Shanusi at 
km 
40 of the Yurimaguas-Tarapoto highway two days before the 
referendum. Just 10 days ago new flags were raised by 
subversives in Pampa Hermosa and Alianza announcing their 
presence and showing the power of "El Ministro."

  [Text] The race for the presidency of the Republic has 
begun, although it appears to be a timid start, if we look to 
the public statements of the possible candidates. But if we had 
access to the intimate thoughts of each of the possible 
presidential candidates, it is certain that we would find a 
rather mature decision. 
  What stage has the battle for the 1995 presidency reached? 
The first certainty is that there are only 16 months left before 
the election date. The second fact, and this is perhaps the 
decisive one, is that the results of the referendum have not 
only altered the political map, but also seem to have mobilized 
the presidential ambitions of various individuals. 
  The scenario has certainly become more complicated, because 
the opposition to the government has become bolder. But it is 
also a fact that in Fujimori's party sector, more than one 
hopeful has emerged. Up until the date of the referendum, it was 
possible to foresee the launching of a single candidate by the 
entire opposition as the only proper card to play to defeat the 
current chief of state. Today the opposition appears to believe 
it is even strong enough to be spared the need to agree on a 
single alternative. But not only that. Now the possibility of a 
Fujimori party without Fujimori is developing more broadly than 
could have been imagined just a few short weeks ago. 
  Given this context, it is of interest to attempt to profile 
the first individuals to enter the field--Ricardo Belmont (RBC), 
Daniel Estrada, and Hernando de Soto. 
  Ricardo Belmont has already had a skirmish with Government 
Palace. It occurred last August, and the truth is, according to 
the surveys taken then and despite the limited attendance at the 
meeting convoked in Manco Capac Square in connection with what 
had happened, he did not do badly in his clash with the 
executive branch. 
  The IMASEN undertook a survey during those weeks that it we 
would do well to recall. To begin with, a very high 70 percent 
of the population of Lima admitted having "knowledge of the 
conflict between Ricardo Belmont and the president of the 
Republic." A substantial 53 percent believed that the government 
was failing to provide Belmont with the resources needed for the 
administration of his department. And further still, about 27 
percent were convinced that the government was not giving the 
mayor the needed resources "because Belmont might be successful 
as a candidate for the presidency." Not even water could be 
clearer. And it should be no surprise that "Hermanon" has very 
carefully evaluated the positive results of these encounters 
with Engineer Fujimori (AFF). 
  However, in that same month, the IMASEN compared AFF and RBC 
as presidential candidates. The former won out, with 58.7 
percent as compared to the 20.8 percent for the mayor of Lima. 
Now "El Colorao" may be thinking that the referendum has 
broadened his space and that the months still remaining before 
the electoral date may favor him even further. This man always 
"thinks positive." 
  But in the most recent issue of IMASEN CONFIDENCIAL 
(November 
1993), the administration of the mayor of Lima received good 
marks--an approval rating of 61.4 percent as compared to a 
rejection rating of 31 percent. (This survey was taken 
exclusively in Lima.) 
  The conclusion reached by this same survey organization is 
that Belmont is maintaining his position, and that his approval 
rate is improving in the lowest stratum and declining in the 
middle-upper strata. This means, of course, that he would be a 
candidate who would for the most part eat into a portion of the 
same social strata as the current incumbent in Government Palace. 
  However, Belmont's possible candidacy raises several 
questions. Thus far it has been a phenomenon limited to Lima 
(although it is true that he enjoys broad acceptance in the 
poorer sectors). He has not, therefore, had an opportunity to 
assess how well he would be accepted in the country's provinces, 
which are today so sensitive to the centralism in Lima. 
  Another matter of concern regarding Belmont is his habit of 
improvising. A few days ago, he made the statement during a 
political program that a political platform for governing should 
be drafted by technicians, who could readily be hired on 
contract. This statement, of course, reminds us of one made by 
Luis Bedoya Reyes some decades ago now. 
  All of this seems to the mayor of Lima to be a matter of 
image and "projects." As for the rest, as he says, it would be 
up to the technicians hired. All of which is, naturally, highly 
debatable, when it comes to managing a city like Lima, and to an 
even greater extent, when one is trying to administer a country. 
  This characteristic, which has heretofore been a part of 
RBC's charismatic "spontaneity," might be a highly vulnerable 
point when he is compared with other candidates who appear more 
solid and combine proposals with image. He has, moreover, 
revealed this more dangerous side when, for example, candidates 
lacking any prior knowledge about or evaluation for their 
positions have been chosen. There have been such flagrant 
instances as those involving Jorge Vasquez, in Villa El 
Salvador; and Jose Rubio, in San Martin de Porres. 
  A few months ago, Belmont said that he would not run as a 
candidate for the presidency. And that he was not very 
comfortable in a tie, or in a suit, either, while men like 
Carlos Bolona could indeed wear them much more naturally. The 
allusion could not be clearer. If the candidate was the issue, 
he already had his own. The former minister of economy favored 
him, and very nearly put his name forward. What has changed 
between that time and the present? Perhaps it is that Fujimori 
no longer seems to Belmont as monolithic as before, and that his 
second municipal experience has convinced him that he is now 
ready to play in the first division. 
  One could also surmise that Belmont's affinity for Bolona 
has 
not dwindled, that he is teamed with "Car'e bebe," and that they 
might well join together on a single "super-Lima" platform. 
  But what does Belmont offer that differentiates him from 
Fujimori? RBC maintained a notable level of agreement with 
Government Palace until he ran for office a second time at the 
beginning of this year. It will readily be remembered that when 
Pablo Gutierrez, the candidate of the government party for the 
position of mayor of Lima, was headed downhill, AFF could find 
no better alternative than to throw his support to RBC. It is 
also a fact that in this instance, Belmont was very cautious, 
and made it clear that no one owed anybody anything, and that he 
had won thanks to his own efforts. But the internal coup of 5 
April and many of Fujimori's measures had already won the 
support of the municipality. 
  Belmont then is the man who might say he offers as an 
alternative a Fujimori movement without Fujimori, probably in an 
attempt to show that the difference he would make has to do with 
respect for the autonomy of the institutions. The difference 
would be, then, more one of style and communication methods than 
one of political proposals. 
  Would the business community in Lima support a candidacy 
like 
that of Belmont? This remains to be seen. It will depend on how 
much strength he gains in the coming months, and what he can 
offer the businessmen. The mayor's ambitious program for 
rebuilding historic Lima will not, of course, be enough. 
  Another candidate who has practically joined the race is 
Daniel Estrada. The mayor of Cusco is up to a point the 
anti-image of Belmont. Perhaps it is not, therefore, without 
reason that his anticentralist ideas are identified, under some 
circumstances, with an anti-Lima attitude. 
  As is obvious, Estrada wants to garner the provincial votes, 
and he recently spoke of the need to achieve a major pact 
involving various regional sectors in order to defeat the 
central power. The results of the recent elections give him a 
basis for this venture, particularly since that, precisely, is 
Fujimori's weak point. 
  Estrada's credentials are based on his successful municipal 
administration record in the city of Cusco, and he intends to 
increase his appeal with his anticentralist proposals, now 
combined with a plan, debatable in the eyes of many, for a 
federal Peruvian state. However, his current strength may also 
prove to be a hindrance to his broader national acceptance. 
  Estrada is not like any other anticentralist leader, since 
he 
insists on emphasizing the heritage and representation of the 
ancestral Cusco. The question arises as to how he would 
integrate this particular characteristic with a national debate 
and plan that would not only include the other regions, which 
are so dissimilar and so "regionalistic," but also Lima itself, 
with its highly diverse population. 
  On the other hand, could the interregional pact he so much 
desires be achieved? The first obstacle is the difficulty of 
obtaining the support of the other regional leaders who have 
party affiliations, like Jose Murgia, of Trujillo, or whose 
representation is clearly local, with roots more in the coastal 
population than the Incas, such as Tito Chocano, the mayor of 
Tacna. 
  It must also be remembered that Estrada makes no secret of a 
style that is sometimes authoritarian. During a recent 
television appearance, he justified the events of 5 April and 
criticized the old parliament harshly. His only criticism of 
Fujimori's authoritarianism was that it was too cold and 
"robot-like." 
  It is difficult to imagine what the mayor of Cusco would do 
if he were installed in Government Palace. There can be no doubt 
that an anticentralist policy would be promoted at full speed, 
but what is unknown is what his institutional administration 
would be like, and what his relations would be, with the 
parliament, with the political parties, and with the Armed 
Forces, for example. The same can be said about his economic 
policy. The unknown factors predominate, but there are still 
several months remaining in which they could be clarified. 
  Carlos Bolona (CBB) is another individual who is making 
incursions in the party sector. It is said that there is one 
group of businessmen who have confidence in him, and that these 
individuals are prepared to play him as their card in the hope 
of replacing Fujimori. 
  Bolona has established his institute, and he issues rather 
regular opinions on current political subjects. The profile of 
his possible candidacy is for the time being less clearly drawn 
that of the others. But his interest in the presidency has been 
more or less obvious for some time now. 
  The leading credential CBB has to offer is his 
administration 
as head of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. This action, 
which won applause in one sector, provoked criticism in another. 
As a result, it is quite probable that if Bolona should in the 
end be persuaded to launch his candidacy, he would have to 
broaden his base of support. He would need a good running 
mate--perhaps one of provincial origin, and a "marketing 
campaign" to modify his very capital-oriented image and his 
apparent extreme closeness with wealthy business sectors. 
  The support of General Jaime Salinas Sedo's precandidacy by 
Javier Valle Riestra and Gustavo Mohme represents the initial 
effort to clarify the image of the most obvious opposition 
candidate today. Salinas Sedo could be the "more combative" 
candidate Fernando Belaunde is demanding to oppose Fujimori. 
  Without a doubt, his candidacy represents the polarization 
of 
the government and the current high military commanders. There 
are basically two obstacles for Salinas Sedo at the present. One 
is winning over the more centrist sectors that are less radical 
in their opposition to the government, and the other is 
overcoming the problems of a legal nature that could be put 
forward formally to block his candidacy. 
<H5>  "Get Ready, Get Set" </H5>
  Hernando de Soto also seems to be adjusting his stance at 
the 
starting line. Last week, he made public his proposed 
constitutional reform by popular initiative. This week he 
announced that next Tuesday, the Freedom and Democracy Institute 
(ILD) and the popular institutions supporting his proposal will 
launch a campaign to obtain the 35,000 signatures the new 
constitution requires in order for the Congress to consider the 
possibility of amendment. 
  Last week he also paid a visit to the premises of the CUAVES 
[Urban Self-Management Community of Villa El Salvador], and the 
National Agrarian Confederation published a statement praising 
the ILD initiative. On the day of the press conference at which 
the reform proposal was announced, the presence of some 
well-known peasant leaders who were active for years in the 
leftist sector, such as Marcial Quintana and Jorge Arevalo from 
Piura, was notable. 
  The organization of a meeting of 400 delegates representing 
the social organizations throughout the country scheduled to be 
held on 18 and 19 December to rally support for the reform 
proposal set forth seems to be the last step in this first stage 
of preparations for the probable candidacy of De Soto. 
  And so his electoral strategy would begin with advocacy of a 
great concerted union among the representatives of all the 
sectors of society. As an alternative to a concertation based 
principally on interparty agreement, the president of the ILD 
proposes a union supported by the base-level movements. 
  A careful consideration of their proposals reveals that 
neither Belmont, nor Estrada, nor De Soto is urging an agreement 
achieved mainly by the parties, although De Soto may perhaps be 
the individual most desirous of clarifying his disagreement with 
the so-called "partidocracy." 
  De Soto's proposal combines economic liberalism and 
democratization of the state. In a way, it is another version of 
a Fujimori platform without Fujimori. The president of the ILD 
not only collaborated with the present chief of state during a 
certain period, but has also given explicit support to the 
government's economic policy. In this realm, De Soto has let 
slip some criticisms of government improvisation. He has, for 
example, expressed his annoyance at the lack of serious effort 
to promote projects such as substitution for the coca leaf as a 
crop. However, he has endorsed the central aspects of the 
program. 
  The basic disagreement with the current regime he is 
attempting to demonstrate has to do with the democratization of 
the state. In this connection, his proposal for constitutional 
reform calls for the establishment of closer links between 
society and the political regime. 
  The challenges facing his possible candidacy begin with the 
need to ensure that his image "catches on" with the national 
electorate. Unlike Belmont and Estrada, De Soto has not run for 
political office previously. He does not, therefore, have a 
reference point on the basis of which he can project his image 
as a government leader. 
  One unknown factor is how his liberal economic proposal will 
sit with the middle and small businessmen's portion of the 
national business sector, so as to avoid its ending up as a 
simple neomercantilists' adjunct--a dilemma the Fujimori 
government is definitely faced with at present, whatever one's 
view of it may be. 
<H5>  A Hibernating Candidate </H5>
  Perez de Cuellar (JPC) is in a state of hibernation, but he 
has not by any means vanished as a possible candidate. According 
to the most recent surveys on the subject, JPC is the individual 
who appears to be in the best position to challenge AFF for the 
presidency in 1995. 
  In addition to that, the opposition parties in the CCD have 
given him their support, and he may very well be endorsed by the 
sectors that voted "yes" in the recent referendum but have lost 
confidence in Fujimori. JPC's great difficulty is that he has 
made a great consensus a prerequisite, and it appears that 
achieving this will be very difficult. 
  Perez de Cuellar has confirmed that he will visit Peru in 
the 
middle of December. He will be here for some weeks, and will 
utilize the opportunity to test the air. 
  During his earlier visit, he met with leading personalities 
who wanted him to run for the presidency. This meeting took 
place at the home of the painter Fernando de Szyszlo. It is not 
known if he will attend similar meetings this time.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 4 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  In 1993, Pemex placed on the international market a daily 
average of 1.347 million barrels of crude oil for total revenues 
of $5.578 billion. Pemex reports that an average 271,000 daily 
barrels of light Isthmus oil, worth $1.347 billion, were shipped 
to clients in the continent, Europe, and the Far East. In 
addition, a daily average of 870,000 barrels of heavy Maya oil, 
worth $3.124 billion, were shipped to these three main regions. 
Of these sales, 64.8 percent went to Mexico, 15 percent to 
Spain, and 6 percent to the Far East. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in 
Spanish 0051 GMT 29 Dec 93) 
  The Mexican Secretariat for Commerce and Industrial 
Development [Secofi] reports that the country's economic 
stabilization effort and microeconomic reform makes for a 
promising outlook for 1994 regarding Mexico's NAFTA partners. 
The country's per capita GNP increased 1.1 percent in the past 
three years. Mexico's commerce grew 12.6 percent in 1989-1991. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0207 GMT 29 Dec 93) 
  As of the end of 1993, private corporations owe $38 billion 
to foreign banks. This is 160 percent higher than the amount 
owed in 1989. In addition, it represents 10.3 percent of the 
country's GNP. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0200 
GMT 29 Dec 93) 
  As of October 1993, Pemex had produced 14.275 million tons 
of 
petrochemical products, including 710,000 tons of ammonia, 1.095 
million tons of ethylene, 415,000 tons of high- and low-density 
polyethylene, and 9.36 million tons of acrylonitrile, 
dodecabenzene, styrene, methanol, and other substances. (Mexico 
City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2057 GMT 29 Dec 93) 
  Pemex is the first Latin American firm to enter the European 
stock market, a Pemex source has reported. In 1993 the 
corporation placed bonds worth $1.5 billion in Europe. (Mexico 
City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 29 
Dec 93) 
  Secofi has reported that despite the U.S. economic recession 
the assembly plant industry increased 9.4 percent annually, jobs 
created by 6.5 percent, and U.S. dollar revenue by 19 percent 
from 1989 to 1992. At the end of the third quarter in 1993, 
there existed in the country 2,182 assembly plants with 552,078 
jobs, and a revenue surplus of $4.063 billion. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 2322 GMT 2 Jan 94)

<F P=106> ["Text" of bulletin released by the Mexican Government </F>
Secretariat on 29 December; from the "24 Hours" newscast] 
  [Text] The Government Secretariat rejects the charges 
published in the headlines of the 28 and 29 December issues of 
the Spanish newspaper ABC which say that the ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty] mafia network is established in Mexico. 
The Secretariat rejects these charges, because there is no 
evidence, much less suspicion, to support these claims. On the 
contrary, what is evident is the disproportionate tone in which 
the matter is discussed in the report which seems to be a 
typical case of yellow journalism aimed at forcing the 
government to take forceful measures disregarding individual 
guarantees. 
  With regard to the reports in question, the Government 
Secretariat wants to make it very clear that they are not based 
on facts or official statements. They are only based on the 
assumptions of the journalist who wrote the report, based on 
informal interviews with public officials during his visit to 
Mexico. 
  The Government Secretariat does not acknowledge the truth of 
the headlines, headlines that assert that the ETA mafia has 
established itself in Mexico through business fronts for 
international terrorism or that ETA is establishing a sanctuary 
in Mexico to finance itself through kidnapping and extortion. 
Thus, it is also not true that the ETA has established an 
operations' base in the States of Mexico, Guanajuato, and 
Queretaro. 
  These reports claim Mexican authorities possess important 
leads on businesses connected to the weapon's cache found in 
Managua, a few months ago. This is also false. It is true that 
we investigated a report which connected Mexican citizens who 
work at a consultant firm with the Managua arsenal. Based on 
this, the reporter assumes the existence of Mexican businesses 
connected not only with the ETA but with other international 
terrorist groups. 
  It is true that Basque citizens have legally resided in 
Mexico since their admission in the early 1980's. However, one 
cannot surmise, as Mr. Jesus Maria Zuluaga does with exaggerated 
irresponsibility, that they are terrorists and much less ETA 
mafia members as he calls them. One must reiterate that 
concerning matters of legal residence, the Government 
Secretariat does not pass judgment on the basis of the political 
preferences of foreign residents in Mexico. It only asks them 
to meet legal requirements, and acts on the basis of irrefutable 
evidence and fully respects the human rights of its residents. 
  Regarding Mexico's immigration policy, it is very 
conscientious and demands adherence to all legal regulations. 
At the same time, it is open to reciprocal agreements 
facilitating the exchange of persons, for tourism and commercial 
purposes. The benefits granted by these reciprocal agreements 
must not be confused with a lack of strictness in the admission 
of foreigners into Mexico. 
  In conclusion, the Government Secretariat reiterates that 
the 
corresponding authorities scrupulously watch over the nation's 
security and that, under no circumstances, will illegal 
activities be permitted. In the case of accusations against 
foreigners, these must not be groundless, and no actions will be 
taken based on prejudice or political differences that are 
foreign to this country.

  [Text] San Cristobal de Las Casas, Mexico, 5 Jan (AFP) -- 
AFP has confirmed that considerable reinforcements sent by the 
Mexican Army, including a column of armored personnel carriers, 
arrived in San Cristobal de las Casas (southern Mexico) on the 
night of 4 January as part of an operation launched against the 
Zapatist rebels who are beginning to retreat. 
  Fifteen armored personnel carriers, jeeps equipped with 
light 
artillery and several ambulances crossed San Cristobal on 
Tuesday around 2200 apparently heading toward Ocosingo, which 
was still occupied by the rebels of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN]. 
  Military authorities are still keeping quiet regarding the 
ongoing operations against the EZLN, which launched a surprise 
attack on 1 January. Apparently, some 12,000 soldiers are 
participating in the counteroffensive. 
  According to several witnesses, the rebels -- who reportedly 
total 1,000 -- continued their withdrawal from various towns on 
Tuesday, moving their casualties to the mountain area.

  [Excerpt] San Cristobal de las Casas, 5 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- 
The authorities announced that the Mexican Army has been able to 
recover several townships taken over last Saturday by an armed 
group in the southeastern State of Chiapas, although there are 
still some regions that are considered "unsafe." 
  Official Spokesman Eloy Cantu stated last night that the 
government had virtually recovered control of San Cristobal de 
las Casas, Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, and Altamirano, population 
centers occupied by the so-called Zapatist National Liberation 
Army [EZLN]. 
  Nevertheless, in reporting on the events that took place in 
Chiapas, the aforementioned Mexican Government spokesman 
explained that "there are still specific areas where conditions 
of insecurity still persist." "Institutional life and normalcy 
are painstakingly being recovered, in other words, with each 
passing moment civilian authority is being reinstated," Cantu 
stated. 
  Dozens of bodies with evidence of bullet wounds where laying 
along Ocosingo's streets after the Army was able establish 
control of the last population center taken by the armed group. 
The rebel groups decided to withdraw to the mountain region 
located in the north-central part of Chiapas. 
  In Ocosingo, located 800 kms south east of Mexico City, 
Zapatista members attempted to hold on to the last population 
center it originally took. After taking over the first four 
communities, the up until now unknown EZLN began to appear in 
other communities such as Abasolo, Chanal del Carmen, and 
Oxchuc. During the last few hours the rebel group also withdrew 
from Oxchuc. [Passages omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel Angel Velasquez] </F>
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State, 5 Jan 
(NOTIMEX) -- Through its official spokesman, Eoloy Cantu 
Segovia, the Mexican Government this morning asked the armed 
rebels operating in this area of the state to hold talks and lay 
down and surrender their weapons. 
  Talking to reporters in this city, Cantu Segovia, who is 
also 
the Government Secretariat's senior officer [oficial mayor], 
conveyed the government's readiness to begin talks at once with 
the armed group. He added "that for the purpose of avoiding 
greater loss of lives, the Federal Government is reiterating its 
readiness to establish an immediate dialogue with the armed 
group that began its operations the first of this year." 
  To begin this dialogue, the government also proposed a 
framework of understanding that consists of four points: 
  1. The ending of hostilities and attacks on towns and 
persons. 
  2. The laying down and surrendering of weapons, including 
the 1.5 tonnes of dynamite stolen on 31 December. 
  3. The return of hostages and kidnapped persons. 
  4. The identification of interlocutors and leaders of the 
armed group. 
  The official spokesman affirmed that "with strict adherence 
to the absolute respect for human rights, the government will 
make the allowances contemplated by the law with those who 
accept this invitation to a dialogue and lay down and surrender 
their weapons."

<F P=106> ["Bulletin" issued by the Mexican National Defense </F>
Secretariat on 5 January; from the "Panorama" newscast] 
  [Text] Yesterday the village of Ocosingo was completely 
occupied by military personnel after a strong attack by groups 
of aggressors who had taken over certain installations. Traces 
of blood and much destruction was found upon arrival at the 
municipal palace. The same holds true in the case of the local 
radio station and two hotels where the attackers were holed up. 
The bodies of nine aggressors were found in a sewer at the 
municipal market. The aggressors had tried to take away the 
bodies through the sewer system, which served as their escape 
route. The aggressors had resisted the Army for more than 48 
hours from this point. 
  It should be noted that some groups of attackers still 
remain 
in hiding in Ocosingo and occupy certain buildings, especially 
privately owned homes, where occupants are being held hostage. 
Army troops continue patrolling the area to capture or dislodge 
them. 
  To the south-east, villagers in Independencia and Las 
Margaritas are now under military protection. One of the 
aggressors was captured in San Juan Chamula. On the road that 
links the city of Comitan to Las Margartias, a four more 
guerrillas were arrested, including a Guatemalan citizen. Near 
the military installation in Rancho Nuevo another attacker was 
detained. Lastly, in Ocosingo, 20 of them were captured. All 
of the detainees will be turned over to the appropriate 
authorities, who will carry out investigations. 
  Military personnel evacuated from Ocosingo 84 adults and 125 
children who expressed a wish to leave the area. This group was 
given lodging in the DIP [expansion unknown] installations in 
the city of Palenque. Likewise, five policemen belonging to the 
Chiapas State Public Security Directorate and two Judicial State 
Police officers were evacuated after they were wounded by the 
attackers. The policemen were transferred to the city of Villa 
Hermosa where they are receiving medical attention at the area 
military hospital. The number of dead rebels has increased to 65 
while 34 remain under arrest.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 5 Jan (EFE) -- 
Today, several Social Security workers confirmed to EFE that 
some 1,000 rebels of the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN] are still occupying the city of Guadalupe Tepeya, located 
only 800 meters from the Guatemalan border. 
  The workers, who traveled from Guadalupe Tepeya to San 
Cristobal de las Casas today, said that the rebels have mined 
the road leading to Guadalupe Tepeya and kidnapped 100 
civilians. The informants could not state whether there are any 
members of the Public Forces among the hostages. The workers 
added that the residents of Guadalupe Tepeya had noticed some 
unusual activity since 19 December, and that in the last hours 
the power lines were sabotaged. 
  Thus far there are no reports of confrontations between the 
Army and the rebels in that area of the Mexican State of 
Chiapas. Guadalupe might be the only city that remains occupied 
by the EZLN, following its declaration of war on the Mexican 
Government on 1 January. 
  Meanwhile, some fighting is still being reported in the 
neighborhood of Ocosingo as well as bombings on the outskirts of 
San Cristobal de las Casas. A radio station commentator said 
that the Mexican Army bombed three vehicles with 16 reporters 
that were heading to the combat zone near San Cristobal de las 
Casas, but the reporters escaped unharmed.

<F P=106> [Report by AFP correspondent Francis Kohn] </F>
  [Text] Ocosingo, Mexico, 5 Jan (AFP) -- AFP has verified 
that after three days of fighting the Mexican Army recovered 
control early this morning of Ocosingo, 160 km from Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, capital of the southern Mexican State of Chiapas. 
  The bodies of Zapatista guerrillas in the streets of this 
town, with 8,000 residents, are a testimony of the bitter 
fighting that took place. 
  Journalists have verified that Army Infantry Battalions 17 
and 73 occupied the city Wednesday morning. Journalists have 
counted 37 bodies, apparently members of the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army [EZLN], which seized Ocosingo. 
  Most of the dead had head wounds. Inside the Municipal 
Marketplace, where the stench of death pervades the environment, 
12 bodies laid. Next to some of them were wooden rifles turned 
into rudimentary bayonets. 
  Armed Forces personnel at the site refused to comment, and 
no 
official report on the number of casualties has been made. 
According to certain reports, however, more than 100 people 
could have died in Ocosingo. 
  The townspeople, who had been hiding for three days, took to 
the streets this morning with white flags to inspect the damage. 
They covered their noses to avoid the stench. 
  The mayor's office, located in the main square, and its 
interior were burned to a cinder. The neighboring bank saw the 
same fate, and the facades of many buildings are riddled with 
bullet holes. 
  Resident Jorge Gomez said that "there were several hundred 
guerrillas, and they only brought us misfortune." 
  According to several witnesses, some of the rebels were 
heavily armed, but others--mostly young Indians--carried only 
old rifles or machetes. 
  According to these witnesses, the leaders were not Mexican 
but Guatemalan and Salvadoran. 
  Jorge Gomez added: "I think the peasants were fooled by 
professional guerrillas who led them to a carnage." 
  The road leading to San Cristobal de las Casas and Ocosingo 
was blocked with felled trees and large rocks. The Army was all 
but absent. 
  Nevertheless, the presence of the Armed Forces around San 
Cristobal was heavy, and the press was barred from that road on 
Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Samuel Ruiz Garcia, bishop of San Cristobal, </F>
by unnamed L'UNITA correspondent in San Cristobal on 4 January: 
"`My Church Suffers With the Rebels. It Is as If History Had 
Stopped Here'" -- first two paragraphs are L'UNITA introduction] 
  [Text] San Cristobal. When Rigoberta Menchu succeeded in 
escaping from Guatemala, shocked by the extermination of her 
family, Bishop of San Cristobal Samuel Ruiz Garcia took her 
under his care. Don Samuel not only helped Rigoberta reacquire 
her psychological integrity. For over 30 years now he has been 
fighting against the injustices that oppress the heart of 
Mexico. Now he has written to the Vatican asking for 
explanations regarding the accusations that have been made 
against him: He wants clarifications concerning the charges, 
which according to him are generic, making reference to an 
excessive partiality toward the poor as well as mistakes in 
doctrine and reduced pastoral activity. It is the prelate 
himself that is making the criticisms made by the nuncio in 
Mexico, Girolamo Prigione, in "indirect" relation to the coming 
presidential elections in Mexico and the privatization of land 
following the approval of the treaty on free trade (NAFTA). 
That is what the bishop states in an article that will be 
published in the next issue of the monthly NARCOMAFIE, which has 
provided a leak on the text. 
  Don Samuel is small, dresses in white, and has an energetic 
and cordial appearance. He wears a small amber cross around his 
neck -- amber is one of the few riches in this extremely poor 
Chiapas. While I talk to him, I cannot help thinking that it is 
fossilized resin, the tear of a tree that has been fossilized 
for years. 
  [L'UNITA] San Cristobal de las Casas is a town that was 
famous for its tranquillity. It has suddenly turned from being 
a faraway suburb to the center of the "global village" thanks to 
the work of the Zapatist army. What is your point of view about 
what is happening? 
  [Ruiz Garcia] I will tell you what our position is. And 
this is our, not my position because it represents the opinion 
of all three bishops of the State of Chiapas. We have three 
dioceses here: Tapachula, Tuxtla Gutierrez which is the capital 
of the State, and San Cristobal de las Casas, which is the 
oldest of the three. Looking at the present and future, we 
bishops from Chiapas have issued a first notice to our followers 
in the three dioceses in which we show our concern over the 
recent events. We regret the line of action chosen by the 
Zapatist army and consider it to be the result of the anguish 
and suffering of the Indians of this region and we understand 
their pain and frustration. We can understand that what they 
did in their anguish appeared to be the only way out of a 
situation that has been going on for centuries. Over the past 
500 years these native populations have come to occupy the 
lowest ranks of our society. Their situation has always been 
misunderstood or denied. On the other hand we consider that 
there are objectively other paths that have still not been 
attempted and understand that psychologically the Indians cannot 
see any other way out. And this has led them to declare war 
against the Mexican Army. 
  [L'UNITA] Don Samuel, the international press has suddenly 
realized that you are the object of an attempt to remove you 
from your seat. In reality, this attempt began in October, but 
the news was not made known in Italy. It is also true that 
until a few days ago Chiapas was not in the news... 
  [Ruiz Garcia] I can understand that the Vatican covered this 
news up, but here in Mexico it was reported in all the press 
with a wealth of detail. However, let us return to the current 
situation: We bishops in Chiapas have made a second joint 
communication in which we offer ourselves as mediators between 
the two conflicting parties in order to initiate peace talks. 
Of course we are waiting for the two sides to approve this 
mediation. Yesterday evening (Monday 3 January -- L'UNITA 
Editor's Note) I met with the other two bishops to establish how 
we would act in our commitment to serve. We are aware of the 
role that the Church can play in starting talks and we have 
urged for the approval of the two parties. 
  [L'UNITA] Was the response a positive one? 
  [Ruiz Garcia] We have already received the government's 
assent but we have not received a response from the guerrillas. 
This does not mean that they are refusing our offer but simply 
that we have no channel to communicate with them. The only ones 
that can help us establish contacts are the mass media. 
  [L'UNITA] Today San Cristobal is well and truly under siege. 
The main square and therefore the cathedral and the seat of the 
bishopric are heavily garrisoned by soldiers. Don't you feel 
encircled? 
  [Ruiz Garcia] In reality, the whole center is militarized. I 
myself can enter and leave whenever I choose. All that happened 
is that I once had to drive down the wrong side of the street to 
park my car. 
  [L'UNITA] It appears that you do not have fewer enemies than 
your great predecessor. The same malicious rumors, which 
originated most probably with the Chiapas landowners, are trying 
to present you as the fomenter of this new guerrilla warfare. 
What is your reply? 
  [Ruiz Garcia] Just this morning I received a publication 
via fax from Berkeley in the United States which carries an 
interview with the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] 
members. Here any tie or relationship with the bishop of San 
Cristobal de las Casas is decidedly denied, though his work in 
support of the human rights of the Indians in his diocese is 
recognized. And the mud slung on him by the local authorities 
is denounced. The Zapatists have said: "The bishop is not 
giving us weapons but at least he is not doing any injustice." 
When people began speculating about guerrillas from Guatemala 
taking part, the Zapatists stated: "We are all Mexicans." 
  [L'UNITA] More should be said about the situation that has 
caused these events... 
  [Ruiz Garcia] All the people that travel to this area are 
certainly very surprised. Here we are living in a kind of time 
warp, as if time has stopped. And we can see this primarily by 
seeing how the native communities live. It is a truly 
depressing situation, the Indians have always been considered 
the dregs of this society. One cannot avoid asking oneself what 
has happened, what caused this situation. Above all, why there 
has never been a substantial change, what has the Church been 
doing all this time, and what official measures were really 
taken to put a stop to this situation?

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 5 Jan (EFE) -- 
The Mexican Armed Forces on 5 January resumed bombing enemy 
positions in the mountainous zone of San Cristobal de las Casas, 
Chiapas State, civilian sources told EFE. 
  At least three helicopters and two planes are participating 
in the bombings that began in early this morning in a zone 
located approximately 4 kms south of San Cristobal de las Casas 
and where there are 13 Indian towns with a population of 5,000. 
The main towns under attack, where clashes have been held with 
scattered guerrillas of the Zapatista National Liberation Army 
(EZLN), are: Corralito, San Isidro, El Ocotal, Corazon de Maria, 
San Antonio Los Banos, and Pinavetal. 
  The residents of San Cristobal de las Casas have said the 
situation has become "alarming" because the bombings started 
behind the mountain ranges and are now continuing on the 
outskirts of the city, although sources said that at first 
glance one cannot detect the presence of guerrillas. The 
sources could not say how many soldiers are involved in the 
operation but noted there are 10,000 soldiers just in the 
state's capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, in addition to other 
contingents in Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and Ocosingo, where 
the fighting continues. 
  Official reports indicate the bombings and clashes have 
ceased, although there is the possibility that the authorities 
have refused to give information on the new attacks to keep it 
from leaking to other rebel groups and warning them. 
  This past Tuesday alone, approximately 5,000 soldiers, 27 
tanks, two amphibious vehicles, 18 all-terrain vehicles, two 
fuel trucks, a repair unit, and 10 troop transport trucks 
arrived in San Cristobal de las Casas. Unofficial sources 
indicated that the Army had possibly uncovered several rebel 
headquarters located in the Lacandona jungle and those were the 
objectives being bombed at the moment. According to experts, 
the force deployed to Chiapas is greater than any used by 
neighboring Central American countries against a particular 
guerrilla force. This force has become a genuine military 
offensive. 
  Unofficially it is being said that, despite the Army having 
regained near total control of the municipalities of Ocosingo, 
the Zapatists continue to harass nearby communities. Ocosingo 
as well as the communities of Altamirano, San Cristobal, and La 
Margaritas have not yet returned to their daily work or school 
activities, neither has potable water, electricity, or gas been 
reestablished. 
  On the other hand, several warnings have appeared written in 
red on the walls of buildings in the municipality of Tapachula, 
located 12 kms from the Guatemalan border, indicating: "We are 
already here, we will continue our struggle," and describe the 
population as cowards. 
  In the meantime, rumors still persist in San Cristobal 
related to the alleged capture of "Commander Marco," leader of 
the armed uprising that broke out this past Saturday. The 
prosecutor general of the republic has scheduled a news 
conference in the next few hours to provide details on the 
numerous rumors circulating on the situation.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" with "Commander Marcos," who is "in </F>
charge" of the rebellion, by Roger Gutierrez, in San Cristobal 
de las Casas on 1 January -- published in LA JORNADA newspaper 
of Mexico City -- passages in italics are Gutierrez' 
commentaries] 
  [Text]1 January, San Cristobal de las Casas, 1930 
hours. I walked toward the main entrance of City Hall, which 
was occupied by members of the self-styled Zapatista National 
Liberation Army (EZLN). I asked to speak with Commander Marcos. 
An Indian carrying a gun told me to go in. I climbed to the 
second floor. Everything is destroyed; only the lamps hung 
intact from the ceiling. 
  [Gutierrez] Commander, your troops, the EZLN, seem a bit too 
weak to march into Mexico City and overthrow Salinas. Is your 
attitude a bit naive? 
  [Commander Marcos] Look, if you are waiting for our arrival 
in the capital, it will take some time. he chuckles 
But seriously, I can tell you that what you see here in San 
Cristobal is only a very small portion of our troops; many of 
our men would never be recognized because they wear clothes from 
the mountains, where there are many more Zapatistas than you or 
the government can imagine. Beside, we do not expect to arrive 
in the capital with our men alone but with many more who will 
join us along the way. 
  [Gutierrez] Your weapons are much less powerful than the 
Army's. Is that a great disadvantage? 
  [Commander Marcos] Our weapons are the people and we know 
the 
mountains better than anyone. 
  [Gutierrez] Where were you born? 
  [Commander Marcos] I can tell you I am a Mexican, like all 
the struggling members of the Zapatista Army. I am not from 
Chiapas, however. 
  [Gutierrez] Where did you receive your military training? 
  [Commander Marcos] I can tell you I have military training 
but nothing else. I know the difference between fighting in the 
city, in the countryside, in the flat lands, in the mountains, 
in the jungle, and in the desert. 
  A colleague of Commander Marcos addresses him and they talk 
for a few minutes. I look around. I see Chiapas Indians, armed 
with really old guns except for some 19 or 20 of them who carry 
better weapons. I take the opportunity to ask one of them about 
the reasons and risks of this uprising, and the only reply I 
received was: "We have been shafted, we are hungry, but we are 
fighting. We have no home or medicines, but we are fighting." 
  I return to Commander Marcos who just learned that the 
uprising was reported on television. He stares at me and says: 
"Let's see if those sons of bitches continue to deny the 
existence of guerrillas in Mexico." 
  [Gutierrez] Have you anything to do with Liberation 
Theology? 
  [Commander Marcos] No, we have become liberated without any 
theology. he laughs Among our people we have 
evangelists, Catholics, atheists, sorcerers, etc. I am not 
joking about the sorcerers. There are sorcerers from Chiapas. 
  Marcos seems well instructed and very sure of his 
statements. He jokes around as if his life were not in serious 
danger 
  [Gutierrez] Does the EZLN want new elections after a 
transition government? 
  [Commander Marcos] We are demanding real elections for the 
first time in many years. What we now have, what they are 
planning for Colosio is just a masquerade. We all know that the 
votes do not count and that everything follows the whim of 
(Carlos) Salinas, who is a usurper and a traitor. We demand 
real elections with a chance for all parties, not just for the 
PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]. 
  [Gutierrez] Everything seems to indicate that the 
inhabitants 
of San Cristobal are not in the least happy with your attack on 
this city. Everyone on the street is making comments like, 
violence doesn't lead anywhere and other similar things. Are 
you not worried about this repudiation by the people? 
  [Commander Marcos] Of course I would prefer things to be 
different. But I want to clarify that San Cristobal's residents 
and the non-Indian population are racists. If one of them 
boards a bus and an Indian is seated, they make him stand to 
allow the other person to sit. If an Indian is coming down the 
street, either walking or on his bicycle, they will drive their 
cars dangerously close, threatening the Indian. If those kind 
of people condemn the EZLN, you can imagine that I do not care 
in the least. 
  "As for the issue that violence doesn't lead anywhere, I can 
answer you that we have adopted this extreme position because of 
the institutional violence that causes us to die of cholera, 
malaria, or measles; which allows the Army to permanently 
violate human rights; and which allows hunger and misery to 
prevail in the country, all because of Salinas. We do not even 
want to become the government. We only want a democratically 
elected government and respect for ethnic groups. 
  Another thing I would like to clarify is that I am not the 
leader of the EZLN. We do not have a leader; we have a 
committee. I am only in charge of the operation in San 
Cristobal." [quotation marks as published]

newscast] 
  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has reaffirmed 
that respect for the civilian population's human rights, along 
with gauarantees that allow media representatives to carry out 
their duties, is of foremost importance in the search for a 
solution to the conflict in Chiapas. 
  The president ordered the people responsible for 
organizations involved in operations in the Chiapas highlands to 
ensure this. The Mexican president on 5 January asked Jorge 
Madrazo Cuellar, president of the National Human Rights 
Commission, to visit Chiapas to correct any situation that might 
harm civil rights. The Mexican ombudsman headed for San 
Cristobal de las Casas on the afternoon of 5 January.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Armenta from the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Permanent Commission of Congress has reached an 
agreement on the violent events in Chiapas State. The 
legislators proposed the creation of a commission comprising 
senators and deputies that would be tasked with investigating 
the events in the country's southeast. The legislators are also 
demanding from the authorities more information on the 
insurrection in Chiapas. 
  Here are some of the proposals that the Permanent Commission 
has made on the Chiapas case. The proposals are read by 
Institutional Revolutionary Party Deputy Efrain Zuniga Galeana. 
  [Begin Zuniga recording] The Permanent Commission of 
Congress 
proposes: 
  1. To urge those who are carrying out armed protests to 
contribute to an end of the fighting, to accept mediation, and 
to contribute -- together with the authorities and society -- to 
the establishing conditions suitable for dialogue and 
negotiations. 
  2. The people are entitled to systematically receiving 
truthful and timely information. 
  3. The formation of a group composed of legislators from the 
three working commissions. The group will be responsible for 
securing the necessary information to suggest, within the 
framework of its attributions and responsibilities, political 
solutions to the situation that prevails in Chiapas State. [end 
recording] 
  The legislators of the Permanent Commission also said that 
in 
order to safeguard the country's independence and sovereignty, 
it is necessary to maintain constitutional order in Chiapas 
State.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo] </F>
  [Text] We arrived in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas 
State, after a long journey, as has been the case in the past 
days. We learned that Eloy Cantu Segovia, the federal 
government's official spokesman in San Cristobal de las Casas, 
will give a news conference. He told us, as we reported to our 
listeners moments ago, that Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, president of 
the National Human Rights Commission, would visit San Cristobal. 
We will give details of Madrazo's news conference later. 
  He reported that there were clashes overnight, that clashes 
continued at about 0400, especially in the mountain areas near 
San Cristobal de las Casas. It was also reported that the 
rebels managed to corner a squad that was attacking these law 
violators, but the Mexican Army rescued them. 
  Cantu admitted that there are still areas where uncertainty 
prevails. The rebels continue to operate out of and to hide in 
houses, as was the case in Ocosingo. Members of the Zapatista 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] are hiding in houses there and 
holding its occupants hostage to protect their own lives. 
  He said that the bodies of 20 EZLN members were found in 
Ocosingo. According to the observations and estimates we made 
on 4 January, the EZLN sustained more than 30 dead here. Cantu 
added that the rebels have sustained 61 dead so far. This is 
the figure registered by the Mexican Army, which managed to 
arrest 34 subversives. 
  As for Jorge Madrazo Cuellar's visit here, Cantu said that 
the priority is to ensure a respect for human rights and the 
civilian population. He added that greater guarantees will be 
granted to reporters to allow us to perform our work. Cantu 
also reported that in a few hours there will be shipments of 
food, potable water, and food to the residents of Ocosingo, 
which will mark its fifth day under siege, so to speak, or amid 
clashes. 
  Cantu profoundly regretted the incidents involving our 
fellow 
reporters who were sent here. He added that each incident will 
be investigated. We will now hear Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, 
president of the National Human Rights Commission, during his 
news conference. 
  Madrazo said that he came with other officials of this 
commission to register complaints and reports on human rights 
violations during the clashes. Madrazo reaffirmed that each of 
these reports will be investigated, because human rights are 
respected and guaranteed in Mexico. He added the following: 
  [Begin Madrazo recording, in progress] ...in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez. We initially responded to a request to help in 
evacuating tourists from the conflict area [words indistinct] I 
am accompanied in this work brigade by the first general 
inspector, the third general inspector, experts on criminology 
and forensic medicine, and personnel who are involved in 
investigations and communications. 
  At this juncture of the conflict the National Human Rights 
Commission's work will focus on offering support to civilians 
who have nothing to do with the armed confrontation. The 
commission will also register all existing evidence on alleged 
human rights violations. The investigation and the report on 
conclusions will take place within the terms established by the 
Constitution and the Basic Law of the National Human Rights 
Commission. [end recording] 
  These were the highlights of developments that occurred on 5 
June in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State.

  [Text] The armed struggle is not the way to resolve the 
problems Mexico is facing, Cuban Ambassador to Mexico Jose 
Fernandez de Cossio Rodriguez has said. He added that the 
situtation in Chiapas does not justify an armed uprising. Let 
us listen to the statements of Fernandez de Cossio: 
  [Begin Fernandez de Cossio recording] The armed struggle, as 
many other ways of settling problems in some countries, is not a 
universal recipe. In the places in which armed struggles have 
been waged, they have been caused by a series of factors, which 
do not appear to be present in the case of Mexico. [end 
recording] 
  In an interview here at the Foreign Relations Secretariat, 
the Cuban diplomat rejected the possibility that the weapons 
used by rebels may come from that Caribbean island. He voiced 
his country's solidarity with the decisions of the Mexican 
Government to seek a peaceful solution to the armed clashes in 
southern Mexico.

marks recorded] 
  [Text] Socorro Diaz Palacios, deputy secretary for Civil 
Protection and Social Prevention and Readaptation, released a 
communique issued by the Government, National Defense, and 
Social Development Secretariats and the Attorney General's 
Office, clarifying that the attack by armed groups on four 
Chiapas State municipalities is not an Indian uprising. 
  [Diaz] "This is not an Indian uprising. In the past few days 
various Indian and peasant communities in the four 
municipalities have rejected and taken action against this armed 
group." 
  She said the armed group is comprised of two different 
elements. 
  [Diaz] "There is a professional leadership, expert in 
leading 
violent and terrorist acts, well-educated, made up of both 
Mexicans and foreigners. The leadership has high-powered 
weapons and uses sophisticated communications equipment. The 
others are Indians and peasants, many no older than 14 or 15, 
with deficient education and training, armed with machetes, 
shotguns, or small caliber weapons." 
  She explained that the four municipal capitals are now 
secure, but the radical group continues harassing the Army. 
This is why security measures are being reinforced. 
  [Diaz] "The government is making an enormous effort to 
assure 
that the effect on civilians of these attacks be an minimal as 
possible." 
  She spoke of specific instructions for civilian defense. 
  [Diaz] "There will be no arbitrary actions or violations of 
rights. Those who violate these principles will be punished 
according to law." 
  Socorro Diaz explained that the government has publicly 
accepted the call by the Chiapas bishops and the Evangelical 
Church asking that the violence end and that human life be 
respected. 
  [Diaz] "The armed aggressor group has said nothing; their 
reply has been to continue the violence. The Army is fulfilling 
its constitutional obligation of preserving peace, ensuring 
domestic security, and protecting the population in their 
villages." 
  Diaz reiterated the government's recognition of backward 
conditions and a history of abuses and neglect in Chiapas. For 
this reason the government was forced to be extremely prudenct. 
  [Diaz] "The government did all it could to avoid violence." 
  She said that in 1993 there were clashes between the Army 
and 
the radical group on three occasions, but the Army's preventive 
measures were discontinued at the request of non-government 
organizations. Increased dialogue was then pursued, as were 
social and economic solutions for the area.

  [Text] Mexico City, 6 Jan (Notimex) -- The Mexican 
Government announced today that Guatemalan national Jesus 
Sanchez Galicia has acknowledged participating with the armed 
rebels operating in the southeastern Mexican state of Chiapas 
after having received military training in Guatemala. The 
office of the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR) pointed out 
that Sanchez Galicia "participated in two clashes in an area, 
tentatively identified as Tekom," where at least 40 members of 
the armed group that appeared last Saturday in the state of 
Chiapas were killed. The PGR details in a communique that when 
Sanchez Galicia was questioned after his arrest, he indicated 
that he had received "commando" training in Guatemala where he 
had learned to use long range and large caliber weapons. 
Sanchez Galicia, according to the PGR communique, said that he 
had also participated in the takeover of the community of 
Ocosingo where members of the so-called Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN] had an intense encounter with the Army 
before withdrawing. 
  The communique notes that following the Ocosingo incidents, 
Sanchez Galicia escaped into the mountains and subsequently 
boarded a bus headed toward Villahermosa, capital of Tabasco, a 
southeastern state neighboring Chiapas. Both Chiapas and 
Tabasco border Guatemala. 
  Mexican authorities reported this Wednesday that they had 
captured 34 Zapatists, including Sanchez Galicia, after the EZLN 
violently attacked several communities and clashed with the Army 
in encounters which according to official reports resulted in 
hundreds of casualties. 
  The PGR points out that Sanchez Galicia was assembling 
another group that was preparing operations in a region called 
Nueva Era, near the city of Champoton in the southeastern state 
of Campeche. 
  The communique explains that Sanchez Galicia was captured at 
a checkpoint set up along the Chiapas-Catazaja junction in 
Tabasco, bordering Chiapas. Checkpoint officials, the PGR 
communique adds, decided to question Sanchez Galicia, who was 
travelling on a bus, because of suspicious looking "scratches" 
on his body and his soiled clothes. 
  Sanchez Galicia was turned over to federal attorney general 
agents who continued the investigation. 
  The communique also states that authorities have obtained a 
"composite sketch" of the so-called "Commander Marcos," who has 
been identified as one of the main Zapatist leaders. He is 
male, 1.74 meters tall, athletically built, light dark skin, 
approximately 25 years old, deep green and very large eyes, dark 
hair, straight and broad nose, round face, average mouth, and 
bushy eyebrows. The PGR added that two specific features of the 
so-called "Commander Marcos", who supposedlly speaks two 
languages, is that he is pockmarked and bald.

<F P=106> [Speech by Juan Contino Aslan, first secretary of the Union </F>
of Young Communists, from the Turquino Peak at 0400 GMT on 1 Jan 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] People of Cuba: Congratulations, on the first minute 
of 1994, our thoughts are with you, you heroic people, Mambi and 
rebel people, invincible people, supreme support of the 
fatherland -- every happiness and victory belong to the people, 
belong to Cubans, belong to those who forged our yesterday, 
consolidate our today, and struggle and will struggle for our 
tomorrow. 
  The enemies of Cuba miscalculated. Those who dreamt of our 
collapse see us taller today. Those who wished for our downfall 
do not know the immense good fortune of having a free 
fatherland. Those who forecasted our death cannot stand to see 
us brimming with life. 
  We are the fruits of a tree with deep roots in the earth of 
our patriotism. The true child of a people of Mambises is not 
born a traitor. Forty-eight hours before his death, Camila said 
that the values and pride of the Cuban people are today as high 
and solid as the invincible peak of the Turquino. And it is here 
that the invincible values and pride of Cubans arise today, to 
the highest point in Cuba, to ratify with Camilo that it will be 
easier for us to stop breathing the pure air of the Sierra than 
to relinquish a principle, than to bend a knee to imperialism, 
than to compromise a single revolutionary ideal, than to be 
disloyal to the fatherland, to socialism, the Revolution, and 
Fidel. 
  We have arisen with Cuba since 1868 and will continue to 
rise 
for her for all times. These are times for rising up to confront 
all difficulties and preserving with our actions the 
fatherland's past, which is now once again our present, a more 
beautiful present because it is the time to preserve our dreams, 
the memory of so many heroic lives, so much blood that 
fertilized the idea. Thank you, Mambises, for teaching us to 
fight without surrender. Thank you, Mella, for having left us 
your great love for the party you founded. Thank you, Guevara, 
for your genuine lesson for the 21st century. Thank you, Celia, 
for your permanent presence, together with Marti, on this peak. 
Thank you, Fidel, for this daily lesson in Cuban revolutionary 
spirit. Peaceful rest for our dead, for whom it will not be 
necessary to raise their arms in defense of our fatherland 
because it will never be torn to bits. 
  Viva forever the dead -- our happiness. [Crowd: Viva!] 
Eternal life to our party, our revolutionary slogans, our 
socialism, and our fatherland. 
  Invincible commander of all times: Here we are. Onward! This 
is also the generation of the centennial. Viva the 35th 
anniversary of the Revolution! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva the people of 
Cuba! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva the party! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva Fidel! 
[Crowd: Viva!] Socialism! [Crowd: or death!] Fatherland or 
death! [Crowd: We will win!]

<F P=106> [Report by Margarita Torres] </F>
  [Text] The Eighth Science and Technology Forum was one of 
the most brilliant projects conducted in 1993 by the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] and the Interior Ministry 
[Minint]. The more than 179,000 grassroots solutions presented 
in 1993 confirm that mass participation was a decisive aspect 
for both military organizations. However, this did not hamper 
quality; on the contrary, it increased it. Technical and 
scientific discipline was an indispensable factor in maintaining 
the combat-readiness levels the times demand and to 
energetically fight crime. 
  The skillful identification and integration of older and 
younger, highly trained specialists made it possible not only to 
repair and produce hundreds of pieces of equipment and parts, 
but also to remodel and produce new weapons. One of these is the 
Mambi, a 12.7-caliber semiautomatic rifle, ideal against 
personnel carriers and fire-support helicopters. This powerful 
rifle reached the national forum, where its creator, Lieutenant 
Colonel Armando Gutierrez, answered Fidel's questions. 
  [Begin recording] [Castro] Does it pierce the shell of an 
armed personnel carrier? 
  [Gutierrez] The bullet, at a distance of 500 meters, can 
penetrate a 20-mm sheet of steel. This was demonstrated in the 
test we conducted. We made several test shots with a U.S. 
Sherman tank, and it penetrated up to 35 mm. Therefore, it is 
possible that it will penetrate all light vehicles, which 
generally have an armor thickness no greater than 10 mm. 
  [Castro] What armor do helicopters normally have? 
  [Gutierrez] All helicopters, except the new generations 
under 
production right now, have light armor, which is therefore 
pierced by these bullets. All these bullets are 
piercing-incendiary bullets, even the tracers. Therefore, even 
while it is piercing, it also burns. [end recording] 
  The results attained by the FAR and Minint in 1993, 
motivated 
by the science and technology movement, constitute a challenge 
for future forums. Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, a 
member of the Politburo and chief of the General Staff, spoke 
before the plenary of the Eighth Science and Technology Forum. 
  [Begin recording] I believe that what we can tell the 
commander in chief today is that we have unleashed a mass 
movement aimed at guaranteeing the defense of the Revolution, 
which will provide extraordinary support to the Ninth Forum, not 
only in priority tasks, but also by solving small problems 
necessary to guarantee the defense of the Revolution. [end 
recording] 
  The science and technology forum movement has entered a new 
phase in the FAR and Minint. All that is needed now is to 
perfect it as a method and workstyle, and to turn it into 
everyone's main duty -- the generals' and the soldiers.'

  [Text] In the early hours of the morning, Commander in 
Chief Fidel Castro Ruz visited the Defense Council of Plaza de 
la Revolucion Municipality which had activated all its alert 
systems to prevent serious damage due to possible storm surge 
penetrations in low-lying areas. All measures were taken in time 
and patrol cars notified the population of the developing 
situation. Three shelters have been set up, the products of 18 
groceries store were moved to safer areas, and cooking gas tanks 
have been allocated just in case. Facilities such as El 
Castillito, Cohibar, Riviera, the Ministry of Foreign Relations, 
and the National Institute of Tourism, seriously damaged during 
the 13 March 1993 storm, safeguarded materials likely to be 
damaged in case of flooding. 
  The leader of the Cuban Revolution was given a detailed 
briefing on the measures being taken. The Plaza de la Revolucion 
Defense Council activated all system in the early hours of the 
morning.

  [Text] Julian Rizo, who is a member of the Politburo and 
first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Camaguey 
Province, emphasized that encouraging efficiency, authority, and 
discipline constitute pillars for tackling the current phase of 
the work being done in Camaguey Province. Rizo said the 
watchword is to optimize. He insisted on the need to emphasize 
tasks such as self-sufficiency [in food], health, education, 
services, obtaining currency, sugar production, and others. 
  Rizo spoke before over 1,200 political and government 
leaders 
from Camaguey municipality and, in his speech, alluded to the 
impact on Cuba's socioeconomic development of the 
intensification of the Yankee blockade and the collapse of the 
socialist bloc. He called on those present to collaborate in a 
determined way to convert the current work phase into a concrete 
reality.

  [Text] An intercontinental solidarity meeting will be held 
in Cuba under the rubric "The Role of People's Movements in 
Latin America and the Caribbean in Drafting Alternatives to the 
Crisis". 
  From 25 to 28 January, Cuba will once again be the stage for 
the largest expression of intercontinental solidarity when it 
welcomes the participants to the Fourth Latin American and 
Caribbean Meeting for Solidarity, Sovereignty, 
Self-Determination, and the Lives of our Peoples. 
  The precedents for the meeting in Havana are similar 
meetings 
held in the capitals of Ecuador and Colombia in 1988 and 1989, 
respectively, as well as the Sao Paulo summit in 1991. The 
impact of the new political, economic, and military realigning 
of the world for the people and nations of Latin America and the 
Caribbean; U.S. policies on the threshold of the 21st century; 
and the role of people's movements in establishing democratic 
alternatives, among other things, are some of the political 
issues to be discussed in the meeting. 
  In terms of the economy, the organizers of the event have 
scheduled debates and conferences regarding regional reinsertion 
into the global economy; the effects of neoliberalism on the 
Latin American and Caribbean peoples; and the peoples' 
alternatives for development and integration and their 
experiences and action programs. More than 1,000 people will 
attend the event, which will be fully underwritten by the 
participants. They will be lodged in the Pan American Village. 
The event will be held in the Convention Center. 
  In order to give direction to all the actions and results of 
the meeting, the continental organizing committee has called for 
the reactivation and strengthening of national committees. The 
national committees have among their main goals collecting funds 
to cover transportation costs and to fully underwrite the event, 
which is an expression of solidarity and material support for 
Cuba.

<F P=106> [From the "Commenting on the News" feature by Miguel de la </F>
Guardia for the "Evening Information Review" program] 
  [Text] Frequently, it has been said that secret or 
diplomatic contacts have been made to improve relations between 
Cuba and the United States, which have been historically at odds 
since the victory of the socialist revolution in Cuba 35 years 
ago. Apparently there were some secret contacts during the 
administration of President James Carter, according to Carlos 
Rafael Rodriguez, vice president of the Council of Ministers of 
Cuba, who revealed this in a recent interview. 
  Interviewed by GRANMA, the Cuban leader revealed some 
details 
of that communication, although he considered it very unlikely 
that there will soon be positive changes in Washington's 
attitude toward Havana. At that time, a secret meeting had been 
arranged between the high-ranking Cuban leader and then-U.S. 
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, to be held at the apartment of 
then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Andrew Young in New York City. 
At that time, a surprising accusation by President Carter was 
made against Cuba. He accused the Havana Government of being 
involved in an internal conflict in the African republic of 
Zaire. Vance, coming from a meeting with Soviet Foreign 
Minister Andrey Gromyko, was informed by the selfsame Carlos 
Rafael Rodriguez of what Carter had said, which also suprised 
the secretary of state. Consequently the negotiations were 
suspended. It was later seen that Cuba had nothing to do with 
the Zaire problem, but the moment for negotiating was over, 
Carlos Rafael Rodriguez explained. 
  We recall that those were the days in which Reagan's 
campaign 
for the presidency focused on accusing Carter of having a soft 
hand on foreign policy matters. Reagan based his campaign on 
Carter's inability to free the U.S. hostages being held by the 
Iranian Government, which became a scandal as a result of 
publicity by the large contingent of U.S. media influenced by 
the nation's extreme right. Carter thought it was necessary to 
harden his foreign policy positions, thereby foiling the secret 
negotiations with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance. 
  Carlos Rafael Rodriguez stated that the current 
administration of President William Clinton believes that the 
Cuban revolution might collapse at any minute and that is why it 
has not shown any interest in promptly settling differences with 
Cuba. Carlos Rafael Rodriguez ruled out the violent outcome the 
Republican administrations of Reagan and Bush hoped to provoke, 
adding that the current policy of Clinton will face the same 
fate. 
  This commentator agrees with the aforesaid position of the 
Cuban leader and predicts that it will be too late for 
Washington to improve relations, because Cuba is demonstrating 
it can once again defeat the empire's pressure.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F>
and guest Luis Sexto from BOHEMIA Magazine -- live] 
  [Text] [Roque] As you know certain changes are taking place 
in our revolutionary process, changes aimed at improving this 
society which is already 35 years old. And the primary goal, of 
course, is to preserve the accomplishments attained over these 
years. However, abroad, in Florida specifically, there are those 
who have plans that differ from these changes. What is the 
alternative they advocate? 
  [Sexto] I could answer with a cliche, a standard phrase, or 
slogan and say that Cuba has no other alternative but socialism; 
but it seems to me that this is not the time for jaded phrases, 
slogans, or cliches. I believe it is time for arguments, for 
thinking, for meditation. Evidently, speaking clearly, Cuba has 
no other alternative, but then something curious happens. The 
changes taking place today in Cuba, changes aimed at reversing 
the crisis we are experiencing today, aimed at perfecting the 
economic means of our society, are seem by some as a form of 
frustration. In other words, some people, including honest 
Cubans, believe that everything being done in Cuba -- tourism, 
investments by foreign companies, hard currency 
decriminalization -- are measures that forcibly lead to 
capitalism. 
  This is, of course, an opinion that in certain cases I 
understand, because it is shaped by a very agonizing or 
desperate view of the situation. Others, of course, believe that 
these changes, this path, frees them from any commitments, and 
they are very opportunistically moving to the opposite path to 
take free shots at the Revolution which yesterday gave them 
everything, including an opportunity to develop their talents, 
potential, and raise and educate a family without major 
problems. Both opinions, however, are wrong. Cuba is not headed 
toward capitalism. That would be silly because it would mean 
opposing ourselves. Cuba is engaged in a hard, burdensome 
struggle to overcome this objective period. This is an objective 
period of economic crisis designed to preserve this whole 
project which for 35 years has shaped the lives of Cubans. 
  [Roque] All this is being done to reinsert Cuba in the world 
of today, from which it cannot remain apart. 
  [Sexto] Exactly. I believe that at the beginning of the 
special period Carlos Lage said in an interview that Cuba is 
making a socialist opening to a capitalist world. I believe that 
everything should be seem from this perspective, which is a very 
broad vision, a vision that has to be flexible because it is 
subjected one way or another to the demands of a reality that 
changes very frequently and is at present very hostile. Cuba, of 
course, has to have the flexibility required to adapt to the 
emergencies of the times. 
  [Roque] These are paths we cannot relinquish. 
  We are discussing the alternatives advocated by the enemies 
of the Revolution. 
  [Sexto] Something curious happens: While certain highly 
concerned Cubans fear that Cuba might be moving toward 
capitalism, fear that the Communist Party of Cuba, the 
Revolution, the Cuban social project might end up being a 
capitalist society, others, at home and abroad, are thinking 
about pushing Cuba toward capitalism. 
  [Roque] What are the alternatives they advocate? 
  [Sexto] We cannot speak of alternatives, we have to speak of 
an alternative. For example, what would be the program of a 
counterrevolutionary government in Cuba? 
  [Roque] I can imagine it. 
  [Sexto] I believe that any intelligent Cuban knows what the 
alternative is. I took the time to research the information, 
read magazines, read cables, and I made a synopsis of the 
alternative that a counterrevolutionary government might offer 
the Cuban people, who they claim are greatly burdened. 
  [Roque] For example, there is the Cuban American National 
Foundation [CANF]. 
  [Sexto] The CANF is the most powerful lobby in the United 
States. It is the most powerful for the simple reason that it 
has the most money and because until recently it enjoyed 
absolute support from U.S. administrations. It is a 
counterrevolutionary association created by businessmen. That is 
enough to make one apprehensive, for one to begin to worry. It 
is a group made up of businessmen that advocates an alternative 
for Cuba. 
  [Roque] These businessmen, of course, make monthly 
contributions to the foundation. 
  [Sexto] That group had up to a few years ago approximately 
50,000 contributors, of course, businessmen. A few years back it 
had a membership of 276,000 people. All these figures should be 
taken with a grain of salt. There is no doubt that these figures 
may have been altered, there is no doubt that the CANF leaders 
might be saying that they have more supporters than what they 
have in reality. You know that Miami politics are a little 
extreme. 
  [Roque] Coming back to the issue: the alternative of the 
Miami-based CNAF. 
  [Sexto] What does the chairman of this organization, 
millionaire Jorge Mas Canosa, advocate? Mas Canosa believes that 
poverty ends with private ownership. We would have to ask him if 
he became rich sharing his money with the poor. That is the 
first question I would ask Mas Canosa. Mas Canosa believes that 
economic progress is only attained with a free market. We would 
have to ask Mas Canosa if the good life for 30 or 40 percent of 
the population in exchange for the poverty, pain, and misery of 
the other 60 or 70 percent could be called economic progress. Is 
it economic progress maintaining balanced budgets at the expense 
of the pain of the hungry, working majorities. I believe that 
all this is highly debatable. For the CANF and its president, 
the economic progress of Cuba can only be attained by becoming 
dependent on the United States. Of course, for a smart Cuban, 
all this is highly suspicious. I believe that we would have to 
say: Hey buddy, don't bother to defend me. What kind of an 
option is that? You are giving me the rock and the hard place 
option. 
  [Roque] We are discussing the alternatives advocated by the 
enemies of the Revolution. When I said alternatives, it is 
because we are going to refer not only to the one advocated by 
the CNAF but also to that of other groups which are not that far 
from that idea. 
  [Sexto] A few Sundays ago, the JUVENTUD REBELDE newspaper 
published an interview by journalist Luis Baez with a 
counterrevolutionary pundit named Tony Cuesta, whose crimes I 
believe everyone is familiar with. I believe that he recently 
passed away due to a heart attack. The interview was conducted 
when Cuesta was released from prison. He was jailed following an 
infiltration. A grenade had exploded in his hand; the 
Revolution's doctors saved his life. He served a few years in 
jail, was later released, and returned to Miami. In that 
interview, which was published many years after it took place, 
Tony Cuesta said that the great problem of the counterrevolution 
had been that it did not have an ideology, that the lack of an 
ideology had disunited them and that that had been their 
disadvantage in confronting the Cuban Revolution, which is a 
tightly knitt group of ideas, a highly cohesive political body. 
  I, of course, do not share this opinion. I believe that the 
Cuban counterrevolution does have an ideology. Its failure 
against the Cuban social project, the Revolution, is due to the 
fact that that ideology suffers much in a comparison with ours. 
It is not the lack of an ideology. Therefore, those groups have 
an ideology -- in this case a bourgeoisie ideology, a capitalist 
ideology. Anyhow, all these groups hostile to the Cuban 
Revolution hope for a return of capitalism in Cuba, of 
capitalism with its entire structures and laws. 
  [Roque] And therefore their platforms. 
  [Sexto] And therefore their platforms with some minor 
differences. For example, a few months ago I read an article by 
Carlos Alberto Montaner, the leader of the so-called Cuban 
Liberal Union, the heir of the liberals whot fled in disarray. 
He said in the articles published in the Miami NUEVO EL HERALD 
that Cuba, under a different regime, under different 
circumstances should never hope for economic development, that 
that was an idealistic chimera. He goes on to say that Cuba 
should forget its hope to develop the sugar industry because, in 
the end, sugar is worth nine cents, that it was better for Cuba 
to grow flowers, that Cuba would become wealthy selling flowers 
to Florida, of course, if the United States were to allow Cuba 
to export its flowers to Florida. More or less, you can see the 
ideas advocated by these men. 
  [Roque] That is his alternative. 
  [Sexto] That is his alternative. It seem laughable coming 
from a man with pretensions of being an intellectual. 
  [Roque] There also are platforms or alternatives advocated 
by dissidents at home. 
  [Sexto] I believe that the so-called dissidents at home.... 
[changes thought] I find it hard to use the term dissident. I 
fully agree with Silvio Rodriguez [Cuban singer], when he says 
that we have let them steal that word from us. A dissident is he 
who disagrees. A revolutionary can disagree with something he 
thinks is not right. That is a revolutionary attitude. We have 
lost the word dissident, and I find it hard to refer to 
dissidents within Cuba. I do not believe they are dissidents at 
home. 
  [Roque] They are counterrevolutionaries. 
  [Sexto] They are counterrevolutionaries. What alternative do 
they advocate for Cuba? The same as Mas Canosa: dependency on 
the United States; a return to capitalism. And in the political 
arena: freedom and democracy. This is even the motto of the 
CANF. We could think that the Cuban who today lives in Miami, 
mostly controlled by the influence of the powerful CANF, lacks 
the liberty to even express himself. We have spoken in this 
program about the Americas Watch investigation that concluded 
that freedom of speech in Miami is fully suppressed by the 
prevailing counterrevolutionary thinking. What freedom can we 
speak of? What democracy? We would have to ask Mas Canosa if in 
the future parliament he wants to organize in Cuba, the 
communist will be represented. 
  [Roque] Summarizing: There is a congruence among all these 
platforms, those abroad and those at home. 
  [Sexto] The alternative advocated by the counterrevolution 
is 
capitalism. The alternative advocated by the Cuban Revolution is 
socialism. There is no other alternative. All Cubans have to 
agree. All Cubans should think with national awareness. Cuba is 
only saved through the Revolution's options. There is no other 
way. 
  [Roque] Start thinking.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina begins a 
official tour of Africa today that will take him to Ghana, 
Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia. Robaina's goals include examining 
and strengthening bilateral relations with each of those 
countries. Robaina highlights the importance Cuba attributes to 
its ties of friendship with the African nations, which 
systematically express their support for the Revolution. 
  [Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 1255 GMT on 6 
January 94 adds that Robaina's delegation comprises Alberto 
Rodriguez Arufe, foreign relations official of the Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba; Laureano Cardoso, 
department chief of the Ministry of Foreign Relations; adviser 
Domingo Garcia; and other personalities. One delegate pointed 
out that the tour, precisely at the beginning of the year, 
stresses the importance Havana gives to its traditional ties of 
friendship with African nations. He also commented that African 
nations systematically express their support of Cuba in numerous 
international forums and that the economic importance of these 
countries -- Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Namibia, with 
approximately 3 million square km and a population of over 34 
million -- cannot be dismissed. In addition, there are political 
ties, particularly with Angola and Namibia, in whose 
independence Cuba played a significant role. Robaina will return 
to Havana on 23 January.]

  [Text] Alfredo Jordan, who is a Politburo member and also 
minister of agriculture, said in Las Tunas that the main 
challenge before the more than 600,000 sector workers in Cuba is 
to increase production this year and progressively reduce the 
state subsidy to agriculture. Julian Rizo Alvarez, first 
secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Camaguey Province, 
at a meeting with rural leaders expressed the opinion that every 
Basic Cooperative Production Unit in cane agriculture should 
have a tractor and a plow with which to prepare the land. He 
explained that he defends this idea because plowing must be done 
rapidly for cane recovery.

  [Editorial Report] Havana GRANMA in Spanish of 14 December 
1993 on page 2 reports that, although the economic situation 
prohibits the building of new day-care centers, resolution 203 
of November 1993 provides for day-care centers for children ages 
2 through 5 to be established in sugar- and agricultural-related 
work centers. According to the article, State resources budgeted 
for food services and raw materials may not be applied to day 
care; rather, the work centers must provide for day care from 
their own resources. If a center does not have the means to 
establish day care, then food services will be suspended. Health 
services for the children include a guaranteed supply of potable 
and boiled water, according to the article.

<F P=106> [Article by Caridad Carrobello, Luis Sexto, and Pedro Juan </F>
Gutierrez] 
  [Text] It is a definitive step. It was meant to be and that 
is what we are working for. Changes in agriculture are the most 
appropriate adaptation, the adaptation most suited to the 
circumstances in which the country finds itself, but those 
changes are only now becoming apparent. 
  In this initial article, BOHEMIA takes a look at a number of 
aspects relating to the formation and operation of the Basic 
Cooperative Production Units (UBPC), but does not exhaust the 
subject. In future issues, we shall focus on problems with 
collection, the important participation of the Youth Labor Army 
(EJT), and volunteer mobilizations. This look at the UBPC is 
based on statements, questions, and answers that explain what 
they are, the purpose for which they are being created, who the 
fundamental participants are, the task being assigned to 
science, and the role that will be played by the combined 
study-work program. 
  The Cuban Ministry of Agriculture is hard at work developing 
the UBPC because they must bear fruit in the near future and 
help remedy the shortage of resources. 
  It is a secret to no one that, compared with previous years, 
the early months of 1993 were marked by a sharp drop in all 
types of farm production. As a result, various measures are 
being adopted in order to make the most of the productive 
reserves of farm workers. 
  Minister of Agriculture Alfredo Jordan is optimistic: "There 
is one cardinal element that makes us feel confident and it is 
that our farm workers are highly motivated, satisfied with what 
they are now doing. The outlook has to be good." 
  In addition to being a realistic measure, turning the land 
over to those who work it is unquestionably a strong incentive 
for men in rural areas, but that is not all. According to 
various experts, when an individual feels that he is the owner 
of the means of production and thus of the product of his work, 
he can face the challenge of producing more even though fuel, 
lubricants, fertilizer, chemical products, and other resources 
are in short supply. Because what is his is truly his, he will 
take extra care to see that his crops are weeded, that no land 
lies fallow, and that he has the right number of plants in his 
furrows. He will plant and harvest at the right time because, in 
addition to being responsible, he will be the direct beneficiary 
of his work. 
  Deputy Minister Oscar Basulto, the Agricultural Ministry's 
man in La Habana, explains: "We have always said that under 
socialism, we were all owners, but to tell the truth, that was 
just talk. We have never had the real owner in the field. With 
the UBPC, the same man who formerly worked on the farm will 
stand guard, machete in hand, making sure that no one riding by 
on a bicycle will snatch a single one of the yucca cuttings that 
he planted because they no longer belong to the enterprise. 
Rather, they belong to him and his cooperative. I am sure that 
millions of ways to save on transportation, fertilizer, and fuel 
will emerge. The farmer will be much happier to get his shoes 
muddy!" 
  Another argument wielded by those ordering the changes is 
the 
feeling of autonomy they give to producers. It is a feeling 
growing out of the very creation of the Basic Cooperative 
Production Units because the regulation gives the cooperative 
complete freedom to decide how many members will band together, 
elect or replace the board, and dismiss poor workers without any 
other organ having any voice in the matter. It establishes work 
rules, defines how much workers are to be paid in advance, 
distributes profits, and approves production plans. 
  The new element is that these plans are not designed "from 
above"; rather, they are drafted by the rank and file in 
response to the voice of experience of producers, the 
recommendations of experts in the unit and the enterprise, and 
paying heed to government agencies that are responsible for 
meeting the nation's needs. The single production plan is not a 
"strait jacket," but may be adjusted. However, it does establish 
production discipline based on the people's consumer needs. 
  In addition, we would like to address the subject of 
something frequently heard concerning a change in thinking in 
rural areas. I believe it is premature to use the phrase, 
particularly when one realizes that it is impossible to remove 
from the minds of those who for years were involved in 
administrative centralism their poor use of resources, their 
failure to make the most of work done in the fields, and other 
forms of agricultural blight. We must not forget that the 
current changes are being made using the same men. 
  However, we must also recognize that many persons are 
beginning to take a serious look at problems in Cuban 
agriculture motivated by a sincere desire to do something about 
them. For example, incorporation into the UBCP means that team 
members once irritated by the lack of management of countless 
activities will now have an opportunity to participate in the 
solutions directly. 
  Like every child that is born, these structures must be 
raised in a healthy manner, far removed from strong and 
inherently harmful temptations. A few reflections are therefore 
called for. 
  Taking for granted the need to meet man's needs as a top 
priority so that he will feel well and therefore produce more, a 
number of dangers nevertheless lie in wait: excessive gloating, 
commitments to take on more than one can accomplish, the use of 
language and tones by the enterprise and the UBPC not likely to 
achieve understanding, and excessive advance payments that will 
not force the farm worker to better performances in search of 
greater final earnings, thus compromising in the end financial 
resources of the unit that would be better put to other uses. 
  Other viruses harmful to the health of the UBPC might 
include 
the failure to adequately estimate the requirements of planting 
or the use of assigned resources, as well as not being alert to 
the possible diversion of products for individual gain. A far 
more harmful element affecting the collection process would be a 
lack of punctuality in picking up products or discouragingly low 
prices like those still paid for certain products. 
  Problems spotted in time have solutions. We desperately hope 
that this new idea succeed because our kitchens depend on it. 
<H5>  [Box, p 32] </H5>
<H5>  Basic Questions </H5>
  1--What are they? The UBPC are a new form of organization of 
farm work. They emerged from a process of gradual adjustments 
being made on farms, ranches, and state-owned enterprises aimed 
at achieving a closer connection between man and the specific 
area where he works. The experience of outstanding CPA's 
[Agricultural-Livestock Cooperative] was also taken into account. 
  2--Where are they being set up? Wherever farm work exhibits 
suitable conditions in terms of crop features, land, and 
infrastructure to be transferred to the unit's jurisdiction. 
Land areas must not be too large or too small to operate 
efficiently. 
  3--How are they being set up? On a voluntary basis, meaning 
that anyone, whether it be a farm worker, crew member, 
housewife, or worker from some other branch of activity may join 
a UBPC. The cooperative community decides who will belong to the 
unit and chooses its president from among the members. Although 
there is no surplus labor force, the new units are to reduce 
their staffs as a way to achieve efficiency and profitability. 
  4--What is their goal? To increase food production. This 
task 
goes hand-in-hand with a series of measures aimed at ensuring 
the stability of the labor force and reversing the exodus from 
rural areas to our cities. 
  5--Who will benefit from these changes? Cooperative workers 
receive the land and housing for their use free of charge. In 
exchange for their efforts, they are guaranteed of products for 
themselves and their families and, in addition to receiving 
advance payment periodically for their work, they participate in 
the final distribution of profits. Those achieving the best 
results will benefit the most. All of this will result in 
increased productivity and in the end, the prime beneficiary 
will be the recipient of this farm production: the people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Agricultural Minister Alfredo Jordan; place </F>
and date not given -- first paragraph is BOHEMIA introduction] 
  [Text] Minister of Agriculture Alfredo Jordan is little 
inclined to interviews: "The best advertising will be to put the 
food on the plates," he says. Despite that honorable stance, 
during a recent tour of La Habana Province with a group of 
newsmen covering the sector, he agreed to dispel doubts and even 
to think aloud about issues yet to be defined. 
  [BOHEMIA] Mr. Minister, in the midst of so many shortages, 
is 
it logical to claim that the UBPC will increase production? 
  [Jordan] We all have high hopes. I recognize the need for 
resources in order to achieve high crop yields. The "microjet" 
banana, for example, requires fuel for irrigation and the 
application of potassium, neither of which we currently have. 
However, if you take constant care of this crop, if you trim the 
shoots and remove the leaves, make sure the sprinkler gets the 
plant properly wet, prune the plants at the proper time and get 
rid of the weeds, you will increase production. That is what we 
are after in trying to bring man closer to the land that he 
works. 
  The new system of farming increases the feeling of 
ownership, 
economy, and the optimum use of resources. To the extent that we 
work efficiently in these units--and we are already observing 
great motivation--with weeded crops, the right population on 
plantations, and everyone interested in results, you will see 
success in production despite material limitations. 
  [BOHEMIA] In the UBPC, how many men will be behind desks and 
how many closely linked to the land? 
  [Jordan] In these cooperatives, all workers are directly 
involved in production. Depending on the day's activities, the 
president will also work in the fields because that is where the 
economy, the yearly plan, is truly designed and also because, 
like the rest of his community, he is committed to producing. 
  At the present time, three or four persons make up the UBPC 
administrative staff. The number of reports has been cut 
substantially. 
  [BOHEMIA] Do you think the enterprises will decline in 
importance? 
  [Jordan] No. I would say they have more work. What is 
interesting is the change in their duties. The enterprise no 
longer administers, but by virtue of its role as the 
government's representative, it is the organ that draws up the 
annual plan together with the UBPC, provides technical and 
material support, buys production, helps supervise and oversee 
how crops are doing, and observes whether technical requirements 
and scientific guidelines are being met. 
  [BOHEMIA] In what areas of agriculture will there be no 
UBPC? 
  [Jordan] They do not all have to have a UBPC. Certain state 
enterprises such as Isla de Turiguano in Ciego de Avila, for 
example, do not have to be included in cooperatives. There they 
have 11,000 head of cattle on 700 caballerias of land. La Cuba 
in the same province has a plan to reach 140 caballerias of 
microjet bananas and may continue as it is. It even suits us 
that they have decided to remain as state entities because we 
shall be able to make comparisons with the UBPC. 
  Our analyses have shown that certain aspects such as 
genetics, the fattening of livestock, and special plans to raise 
mules, horses, buffaloes, and so on, should not change. With 
respect to citrus fruits, there are places where changes are not 
possible because they do not have such important infrastructures 
as housing. In poultry and hog raising, the conditions for 
change do not exist either because there is not enough feed. 
  [BOHEMIA] In other words, different forms of agricultural 
production will exist. 
  [Jordan] We shall have the UBPC, the state farms that cannot 
go into cooperatives because they do not present the right 
conditions, the CPA [Agricultural-Livestock Cooperative], CCS 
[expansion not given], and the once fallow land that has now 
begun to produce in the hands of collectives made up of our 
comrades. In addition, you have areas allocated for the 
production of tobacco and the half hectares given to those who 
set up a kind of family garden as part of the action of the 
People's Council. 
  [BOHEMIA] What about collection? 
  [Jordan] The organization of the system of collection has 
been harshly criticized. There are flaws. Products do not arrive 
on time, there are losses and diversion and so on. 
  Reorganization is a complex task because we must take three 
different situations into account: the capital, the provincial 
capitals, and the rest of the country. 
  I do not think there will be any problem with allowing 
producers to take their harvested crops to sell in the town 
squares of the municipalities and small towns. However, the case 
of the provincial capitals and large cities is different because 
many municipalities tax products. That is where collection 
mechanisms must be carefully worked out. 
  The most difficult situation is in the capital because as 
many as 1,200 sales outlets must be in the rural areas. We are 
currently discussing proposals based on a detailed analysis. 
  [BOHEMIA] Will mobilizations of support diminish with the 
changes in agriculture? 
  [Jordan] We want cooperatives to have the labor force they 
need. Some may try to reduce wage costs by cutting personnel, a 
phenomenon that we must follow closely because it could affect 
how well crops are cared for. 
  This is why I do not think the development of agriculture 
can 
be based on mobilizations, but rather, on the proper use of 
specialized labor. However, we have to be realistic. Solutions 
are not just around the corner and mobilizations will still be 
needed, particularly for peak harvest times, even though I think 
we shall now be more rational in terms of their number and use. 
  [BOHEMIA] What will be done with production surpluses? 
  [Jordan] It is difficult to speak of surpluses when we have 
not even managed to raise production to a level that meets the 
basic needs of the population. I wish our problem tomorrow would 
be to decide what to do with surpluses! Nevertheless, let us not 
get ahead of ourselves. I think that when that happens, we shall 
analyze it as one element that will further stimulate and 
unleash productive reserves.

<F P=106> [Article by Luis Sexto: "An Interpretation: Mine and Ours"] </F>
  [Text] Cuban public opinion, never idle even if a few 
ill-intentioned souls claim the contrary, has formulated a 
disturbing question in the face of the political decision to 
cooperativize state land: Is this a step backward or forward? 
  Theoretically speaking, from a clearly abstract position 
that 
is perhaps based on the rigidity of a manual, the state-owned 
agricultural enterprise, with its vast areas that stretch 
forever and its totalizing mechanization, is apparently a more 
advanced economic concept than a workers' cooperative. 
  The launching and completion of the agrarian reform was 
apparently marked by a rather covert conflict between the two 
concepts: Article 43 of the law promulgated in La Plata in 1959 
informed the INRA (National Institute for Agrarian Reform) of 
the suitability of organizing cooperatives on nationalized land 
to the extent possible. A few were in fact set up. Later on, 
thinking turned more to the formation of state-owned entities. 
At the time, the Cuban economy was able to rely increasingly on 
the advantages of the socialist foreign market, resulting in an 
exponential increase in the amount of machinery and consumable 
expenditures available for use on vast government-owned 
properties, initially known as farms and later as enterprises. 
That agricultural organization created citrus fruit plantations, 
rice paddies, and scientifically designed banana plantations, 
and also created poultry and dairy farms turning out enormous 
amounts of production. It erred in other ways, however. There 
was no direct, organic connection between the worker and the 
land. Excessively low wages could not keep man tied to farm 
production. Incentives such as housing and a reliable supply of 
consumer goods for workers were lacking despite the fact that 
communities were built and that the state market delivered eggs, 
milk, and fish to the far corners of the country. 
  The result was that the farm worker and his family headed 
for 
urban areas in search of more attractive options. Today, only 20 
percent of our population resides in rural areas. 
  Cooperativization tends to reverse this trend. 
  A debate over whether the enterprise is more socialistic 
than 
the cooperative would be futile now and serve only to heighten 
erudite pretensions. The fact is that Cuba no longer has the 
external advantages that enjoyed the benefits of specific laws, 
certain plans, and a number of social goals. Agriculture will 
have to make up for some of the machinery, fertilizer, and 
insecticides by means of innovations and solutions from man 
because what we need is a stimulating structure that will touch 
the individual and force him to reveal his true capabilities. 
  According to the cooperative concept, which is a bold, 
realistic, and flexible political measure, the worker is the 
direct owner of production. While the land remains under the 
state or the nation, a closer, more deeply felt, decisive link 
is forged between man and the land. Results and work are truly 
bound together, inserted into the framework of an independent 
community whose interests cannot, at the risk of inefficiency, 
allow paternalism. For their own sake, these same interests will 
encourage the worker to build his house and nourish himself from 
his own land without being forced to wait for his commercial 
ration. 
  It remains for the Basic Cooperative Production Units (UBPC) 
to accept the challenge of practice. In terms of hope, they 
promise to be efficient agricultural cells, now and forever. In 
a sense, practice has already handed down its verdict: A wage 
disconnected from productivity and production cannot create the 
feeling of social property in the worker's conscience. The 
profitable and recommendable experience of the farm cooperatives 
votes in favor of the UBPC. In them, the producer has 
efficiently combined two relations that once seemed 
unreconcilable: what is mine and what is ours.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 3 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran President 
Rafael Callejas said on Monday that he disagrees with the idea 
of suspending General Luis Alonso Discua from his position as 
Armed Forces chief because of his alleged involvement in the 
disappearance of individuals in Honduras during the 1980's. 
Callejas, who met with Discua today to examine the report 
issued by the National Commissioner for the Protection of Human 
Rights [CNPDH] concerning 183 missing people, pointed out that 
the request made by the Committee of Relatives of Missing 
Detainees in Honduras (Cofadeh) concerning the temporary 
suspension of the military chief "has no legal validity." 
According to Callejas, Cofadeh cannot "level accusations or 
establish responsibilities" concerning the people who 
disappeared during the past decade; he said the preliminary 
report issued by CNPDH head Leo Valladares concerning the 
disappearance of individuals should serve to "build, not 
destroy, and to unite, not divide." The president expressed 
concern because attempts are being made "without legal validity 
to lay the blame and responsibility" on civilians and military 
people implicated in the forced disappearances. He added that 
the courts of justice are the only ones that can establish 
responsibility for any crime. 
  In his 29 December report Valladares said that civilians and 
military people were responsible for the disappearance of over 
100 people. He recommended that the state acknowledge those 
violations, apologize to the relatives, and initiate an 
investigation. 
  Among other military men, Cofadeh points to Discua as the 
person responsible for certain disappeareances because in 1984 
he was commander of the "3-16" counterinsurgency battalion. 
  Discua has denied any involvement in the disappearance of 
people and as he entered and left the presidential palace today 
he avoided reporters who were expecting answers from him 
concerning the Cofadeh's request. 
  On Friday, Cofadeh will ask the Legislative Assembly's 
permanent commission that Discua be temporarily suspended from 
his post and subjected to an investigation concerning the 
disappearances. 
  Cofadeh Coordinator Bertha Oliva told ACAN-EFE that "it is 
not necessary to have legal status to identify individuals 
responsible for the disappearances," and that "what President 
Callejas wants is for us to forgive and forget." "If the 
president had a missing child, brother or any relative, he would 
be at our side demanding justice" added Oliva, wife of Tomas 
Nativi, who disappeared during the 1980's. 
  Callejas underscored that the right thing to do regarding 
the 
missing people is to "end this phase of recriminations, ill will 
and differences within Honduran society in order to establish a 
process of national reconciliation that will be constructive and 
not destructive." The president also said that Honduran society 
"must not create permanent wounds," the events that have taken 
place "must result in something, and an admission should be made 
to the missing people's relatives." 
  "When we are told where the guilty parties are and when they 
have been punished, we will be able to forgive and forget," 
Oliva added.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 5 Jan (NA) -- President Carlos 
Menem today expressed his support for his Mexican colleague, 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, "in the name of the Argentine people" 
in view of the serious incidents carried out in Mexico by the 
brand-new Zapatista Army for National Liberation (EZLN). 
  This was reported by Media Secretary Raul Burzaco at the end 
of today's cabinet meeting in which the implementation of 
educational and social plans throughout the country and their 
projections were studied. [passage omitted] 
  Burzaco was charged with reporting the details of the first 
cabinet meeting of 1994, which was "complementary" to the last 
cabinet meeting of 1993. [passage omitted] 
  Burzaco reported that just after the end of the cabinet 
meeting, Menem called Salinas de Gortari "to express my support 
as a friend, as president, and in the name of the Argentine 
people in view of the subversive situation that is being 
experienced by your country." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santiago, 5 Jan (EFE) -- A Chilean indigenous group 
on 5 January requested that the International Red Cross visit 
the southern Mexican state of Chiapas to prevent the violation 
of the human rights of the Mayan peoples of that region. 
  In a public declaration, the Mapuche Meli Wixan Mapu 
Coordinating Board states that the campesino revolt in southern 
Mexico is due to "centuries of political, economic, and cultural 
oppression," and it indicates that "this uprising is the answer 
to a slow process of ethnical-cultural death." 
  The declaration adds that Mexico's becoming a member of 
NAFTA 
"has condemned the Mayan peoples to death" because their 
production techniques "do not allow them to be competitive" with 
U.S. and Canadian markets, and this is causing "the extinction 
of those peoples." 
  The Mapuche group then makes a call to the International Red 
Cross, the Inter-American Human Rights Commission, and the UN's 
human rights organization to visit the Chiapas combat zone "in 
order to guarantee the integrity" of the indigenous peoples 
involved. 
  Coordinating board leaders Dagoberto Cachana and Alihuen 
Antileo announced that on 6 January the document will be handed 
to the Mexican Embassy in Santiago.

<F P=106> [Report by Colin James] </F>
  [Text] St. John's, Antigua, 5 Jan, CANA -- Political issues 
were dominant in Antigua and Barbuda in 1993 and a new leader 
was chosen for the ruling Antigua Labour Party (ALP). The 
opposition party consolidated its unity, a government minister 
was pardoned from a one-month prison sentence, a new governor 
general was sworn in, and a fight between government and a group 
of environmentalists over a controversial tourism and marine 
development project were other issues making the headlines. 
  Planning Minister Lester Bird was elected at an ALP 
convention to succeed his 84-year-old father Vere Bird, Sr. as 
the new leader. Bird, a former deputy prime minister before he 
resigned from his father's cabinet in 1991 in the aftermath of a 
commission of inquiry, defeated his main rival, Information 
Minister John St. Luce, 169 votes to 131 on September 5. After 
months of campaigning following the tied vote, Bird was able to 
emerge a comfortable victor with his brother Vere Bird, Jr., 
defeating Health Minister Adolphous Freeland to become the ALP's 
new chairman. Bird will be leading the ALP into forthcoming 
general election early next year and has committed himself to 
winning all 16 seats. 
  "I will be taking 16 warriors in battle and I intend to 
emerge with everyone alive," Bird said during his victory speech. 
  Prime Minister Bird will be leaving the political scene next 
year and in a farewell address at the convention, he said: "I 
have served my course, I am a satisfied man." 
  However, the ALP convention was subject to several 
postponements as wranglings emerged concerning the procedure to 
be adpoted in selecting the delegates for the convention. Former 
trade minister and outspoken government backbencher Hugh 
Marshall had declared his candidacy for the leadership, but 
withdrew from the ballot a week before the convention because he 
did not receive a seconder. Marshall had threatened to take 
legal action against the party. 
  As the ALP struggled to put its house in order, the 
opposition United Progressive Party (UPP) held its first 
national convention in April, where trade unionist Baldwin 
Spencer was re-elected unopposed as its leader. Spencer 
nominated newspaper editor and political activist Tim Hector as 
his deputy, and the party set about selecting candidates for the 
next general elections. The UPP also staged several 
demonstrations outside the Ministry of Information in a campaign 
for air time on state-owned radio and television which led to 
Spencer being granted 15 minutes. 
  Just days after its convention, the governing ALP 
administration was stunned by the news that Agriculture Minister 
Hilroy Humphreys was sentenced to a one-month imprisonment for 
contempt of court in a case brought before the courts by the 
Barbuda council, which had a long-standing dispute with 
government over the ownership of lands on the sister island. A 
high court judge had cited Humphreys and two associates of two 
sandmining companies for contempt when they carried out 
sandmining in a specified area of Barbuda on behalf of the 
central government in contravention of an interin court order. 
An appeal was made to the Eastern Caribbean Court of Appeal but 
was thrown out because the proper procedure in filing the motion 
was not followed. However, the country's new governor, General 
Sir James Carlisle, granted the minister and the two associates 
a pardon. That decision upset the local legal community, and the 
opposition announced it was taking steps to bring legal action 
against the governor general. Spencer said the UPP intended, "to 
take the issue to the highest level". Sir James became the 
country's second head of state since independence in 1981, 
succeeding Sir Wilfred Jacobs who retired because of ill health. 
He was sworn at a special sitting of parliament in June which 
was boycotted by the leader of the opposition because he was not 
consulted on the choice. 
  1993 could not have started on a more controversial note for 
the government when it become involved in a potentially 
explosive exchange with a group calling itself the Environmental 
Coalition. It was protesting the constructing of a hotel 
complex, golf course, and marina close to a mangrove swamp. 
Members of the group had attempted to lie in front of bulldozers 
in an effort to stop work. The government's Development Control 
Authority (DCA) had put the project on hold pending an 
environmental impact assessment study, but Prime Minister Bird 
gave the developers the go-ahead to continue work. In a terse 
statement, Bird said: "Bulldozers do sometimes run over people." 
The enviromentalists were unsuccessful in forcing a permanent 
work stoppage, but operations soon ceased on the instructions of 
the developers. 
  Almost simultaneously, the Bird administration came under 
fire for the appointment of former works minister Vere Bird, Jr. 
and ex-Army chief, Colonel Clyde Walker, who were deemed unfit 
by a commission of inquiry to hold public office in important 
government posts. Bird, Jr. was named an adviser to the prime 
minister while Walker was appointed as a consultant in the 
Ministry of Aviation. Pressure from inside the government and 
the opposition forced the cabinet to rescind the decision. A 
displeased prime minister said both men had suffered because of 
the 1990 commission of inquiry into the illegal shipment of 
Israeli-made arms and ammunition to Colombia. 
  Again parliament was the scene of drama as ALP backbencher 
Hugh Marshall publicly opposed bills brought before the House by 
Public Utilities Minister Robin Yearwood and Finance Minister 
Molwyn Joseph. Marshall said Yearwood kept a computer in his 
office for the purpose of victimising consumers he did not find 
favour with. His outburst sparked an angry reaction and a strain 
in his relationship with long-time friend Lester Bird. 
Marshall's attack on Joseph's Business Licence Act prompted the 
finance minister to deliver a salvo at his colleague. The 
legislation was also opposed by the business community as well 
as other ALP parliamentarians and was subsequently withdrawn. 
  Another bill to suffer similar fate was the Free Zone Act 
which was rejected by the Senate on the grounds that certain 
sections were ambiguous, anti-labour, and could interfere with 
established business practices here. Trade Minister Lester Bird 
did not accept the rejection in good spirits. Lester Bird's role 
concerning the financing and construction of Italian-funded 
development projects, including the nine-story Royal Antiguan 
Resort and the ultramodern Heritage Quay Shopping and Harbour 
Complex. [as received] The weekly opposition-linked OUTLET 
newspaper carried a series of articles on the issue and Bird 
reacted by filing a libel suit against its editor, Tim Hector. 
  The publication of a book, "Caribbean Time Bomb," weeks 
before the ALP convention, again raised questions about 
government, and in particular, the prime minister, his son 
Lester, and the U.S Government's relationship with the 
administration. 
  The Antigua and Barbuda economy continues to experience 
moderate growth and predictions are that it will perform a 
little better than the two percent of 1992. The finance minister 
said the country's per capita income was more than U.S. 5, 000 
dollars. 
  "Although it is an indicator of good development in our 
economy, it also works to our disadvantage because the World 
Bank has established U.S. 1,800 as the level to determine 
whether a country... That is accessible to concessionary funds," 
Joseph said. He said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had 
expressed satisfaction with the country's self-style structural 
adjusment programme introduced two years ago. Tourism, the main 
engine of growth in the economy, recorded growth of 6.2 percent 
up to last July. 
  As 1993 closes, the country's two political parties were 
busily campaigning for forthcoming general elections which are 
constitutionally due by March 1994. Latest predictions suggest 
the parliamentary opposition is expected to make a strong 
showing at the polls with the ALP retaining the balance of power.

<F P=106> [Report by Isis Maria Allen for the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] With the reorganization of its internal structure 
and the perfecting of its directorship system, the Cuban tourism 
sector in 1993 ranked among the most dynamic and significant 
sectors of the country's economy. Although official reports on 
these changes have not yet been issued, it has been learned that 
in 1994 the tourism industry will have a ministry that will 
group through a central directorate the Cubanacan Corporation, 
the Gaviota Group, and several hotel chains operating National 
Tourism Institute installations. 
  Statistics show that 600,000 tourists visited the island in 
1993, most of them from Canada, Germany, Spain, Mexico, and 
Italy. Gross revenue figures total over $530 million, which 
represents an almost $200-million increase over the 1992 figure. 
  Given the tourism industry's pivotal role in the Cuban 
economy, the topic was dealt with extensively in debates held by 
the party's provincial assembly in Havana City. The assembly 
agreed that Cuba ranks high among the most popular tourist 
locations in the world. During the debates the assembly also 
discussed shortcomings of the hotel industry such as the lack of 
an established authority and adequate Cuban economic mechanisms 
to manage the tourism sector. Changes were proposed for 1994 
with a view to improving conditions in the tourism industry. 
  Discussing the tourism development program in Cuba from 
another angle, it is worth mentioning that in the past year, 
despite harsh economic conditions and the U.S. blockade, the 
plan to increase our lodging capability continued. For 
instance, not only was the number of airports in various 
locations around the country increased to six, but the 
facilities were adapted to receive international flights. New 
communications systems were either added to or improved upon to 
meet tourist demands. In addition, several hotels opened in 
1993, including the five-star hotel Guitart-Cayo Coco [words 
indistinct] Ciego de Avila, which was inaugurated by President 
Fidel Castro. This hotel is considered one of the most 
beautiful in Cuba and shows the respect that Cuba has for the 
environment in its tourism projects. In addition, it is a clear 
example of the harmonious way in which man can coexist with 
untouched nature. Other newly opened hotels include the 
four-star Barlovento Hotel at the famous Varadero seaside 
resort, the Cuatro Vientos Hotel in Camaguey Province, and the 
Tierramar Hotel in Santiago de Cuba. 
  All of this is evidence of the development program that 
Cuban 
authorities are implementing throughout the entire country. In 
1993, 3,000 new rooms were incorporated into the tourism 
industry. The plan to rescue old installations was clearly 
evinced with the major repairs performed on the Sevilla Hotel in 
Havana, where similar works began this year on the Havana Libre 
and Havana Riviera Hotels under the auspices of such Spanish 
companies as Guitart and the Caguama Caribbean Hotel. The year 
1993 saw the reaffirmation of the presence of hotel chains from 
various countries in Cuba, which is considered by the Cuban 
Government as a necessary and unavoidable step toward achieving 
the rapid growth Cuba is seeking. 
  This foreign participation in the tourism industry has 
yielded very positive results. The administration and marketing 
of Cuban units by foreign chains has led to a higher level of 
occupation of the installations, where the process of perfecting 
the quality of service is noticeable along with the improved 
efficiency of Cuban personnel, who are gaining greater 
experience in an industry that is just beginning in Cuba. 
  Tourism entities from 11 countries -- including Spain, 
Germany, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Jamaica, Chile, and Holland -- 
are present here. Additionally, businessmen from various 
regions have joined the national tourism industry with contracts 
for joint projects such as the Guitart Group with Cubanacan for 
a new hotel in Cayo Coco. 
  New routes of air transportation between cities of this 
Caribbean island and other countries have opened up through 
various companies. Cubana de Aviacion, Cuba's official tourism 
airline, has increased its world's destinations to 30 cities. 
Regular and chartered flights will begin this year to Santa Fe 
de Bogota, Colombia; Paris, France; and Munich, Germany. 
  Cuban cities were added to the itineraries of European air 
companies such as (Stainal), which links Madrid and Santiago de 
Cuba and Varadero, and (Eaurope), which joins Barcelona with 
Victoria, capital of the Basque country, and the famous resort 
of Varadero. In addition, the Italian city of Milan and Cayo 
Largo and Ciego de Avila have been linked. Chilena del Cobre 
Airline, Ladeco, also began flights to this Caribbean island. 
Costa Rica's LACSA and Antillana de Aviacion are now joining 
Holland, Curacao, and Cuba. All these openings promote a broader 
tourism movement to Cuba. 
  Cruises also began this year operated by a mixed foreign 
company. This undertaking will bring large profits to the 
country as vacationers will be able to take a large number of 
tours from Cuban ports. This will allow us to gain experience 
with a view to a possible increase in this activity, which for 
the first time will originate from Cuba. 
  The year 1993 has been, in sum, a year of evolution, 
advancement, and notable perspectives for the tourism industry 
in Cuba, which has as its main resources the natural beauty, 
hospitality, and friendliness of its people, security for 
visitors, culture, history, and a social system that is becoming 
more exclusive in the world. Most tourists list those reasons 
for traveling to this Caribbean island, where they also find 
comfortable accommodations that include in their decor 
representative samples of the works of Cuban artists. They and 
other professionals contribute to perfecting the tourism 
experience. The tourism sector has become a large employer, 
hiring over 60,000 workers directly and promoting the 
development of other areas of the country. 
  Given that tourism will go from third to first place in 
resource generation in the world, Cuba, which needs a notable 
advancement in its economy, has reaffirmed this year its 
willingness to use every resource at hand to develop this 
industry. As Fidel Castro said when inaugurating the Guitart 
Cayo Coco Hotel, tourism revenues can compensate for the losses 
resulting from the disappearance of the Soviet Union and the 
socialist bloc.

<F P=106> [Report by David Berlioz for the "This Very Day" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Rafael Leonardo Callejas has recognized 
that the expropriation of property owned by North Americans may 
deteriorate trade relations between Honduras and the United 
States. 
  According to an article in THE NEW HERALD, an increasingly 
long list of North Americans, perhaps 30, have lost their 
property in Honduras due to expropriation, embezzlement, or 
illegal maneuvers to the point that the incidents are irritating 
Washington and its relations with Honduras. 
  The article includes quotes from statements made by a U.S. 
Embassy official in our country according to whom investing or 
buying real estate in Honduras is extremely risky. He adds that 
North American investors and owners want to do everything 
correctly, in strict abidance by Honduran laws, but piranhas are 
eating them alive. 
  Undoubtedly, the article seriously affects Honduras' chances 
of attracting highly sought foreign investments. 
  [Begin Callejas recording] In my opinion, it is obvious 
that much of this happens because it is presumed that the law 
will always favor them because they are North Americans. That 
is not necessarily the case. [end recording] 
  According to the president, the situation could undermine 
relations between the two countries, particularly trade 
relations. 
  [Begin Callejas recording] Remember that the United States 
makes the introduction of our products under preferential terms 
contingent upon its foreign policy, so complex situations may 
arise. [end recording] 
  The president mentioned the case of the United Nations Park, 
which was erroneously registered in a person's name during 
General Tiburcio Carias Andino's administration even though the 
families that owned the land at the time were compensated. 
  [Begin Callejas recording] A North American purchased the 
land even though he knew about this error, or perhaps he acted 
in good faith. However, an error in the implementation of the 
law does not imply that the state is guilty of an illegitimate 
action. Therefore, the state believes it has the right to 
purchase the land at El Picacho. That is one of the cases 
involved. Consequently, we must be fair here and act within the 
framework of Honduran society. We must accept the fact that the 
North Americans are not necessarily right all the time. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Yesterday, Economy Minister Carlos Chahin urged 
legal authorities to resolve the problem of illegal land 
expropriations from some 30 U.S. citizens because it is 
jeopardizing foreign investment in the country. 
  These statements were made following publication of an 
edition of the U.S. newspaper THE NEW HERALD, in which an 
official of the U.S. Embassy in Honduras warned investors about 
the risks of investing in Honduras due to a disrespect for the 
law. Chahin expressed his surprise over the publication since 
U.S. authorities have spoken "highly" of Honduras following the 
approval of the Copyright Law. However, Chahin said, the problem 
now is that illegal expropriations "leave a lot to be desired 
from the Honduran legal system, which makes me very sorry. 
Therefore, I must tell the next legal authorities so that they 
will be punctual and legalistic." 
  Chahin regretted that situations of this type tarnish the 
level of competitiveness Honduras offers to foreign investors by 
having the least expensive manual labor in Central America. In 
Honduras, one minute of work only costs nine cents, while in 
other countries, such as Costa Rica, it costs about 13.5 cents. 
Chahin added, "We are efficient and competitive, our assembly 
plants have the highest quality in the area, and we have the 
cheapest food staples. The only aspect we do not handle very 
well is bank interest rates because of the high legal cost." 
  Chahin noted that situations of this type jeopardize 
Honduras' benefits in the Generalized System of Preferences, 
under which over $100-million worth of products are exported 
annually to the United States.

<F P=106> [Article by Andres Cisneros, secretary general of the </F>
Argentine Foreign Ministry] 
  [Text] The article entitled "Risky Aftermaths of the London 
Treaty" by Edgardo Aguilera, published by LA PRENSA a few days 
ago, includes -- in my opinion -- inaccurate information and 
assessments that cannot remain unanswered. 
  It is not true, as Aguilera asserts, that the islanders' 
income from fishing in the Malvinas "will probably increase with 
the entry into effect... of another ocean zone, known as the 
Falkland Outer Conservation Zone (FOCZ)." Aguilera bases this 
statement on a comment attributed to the Falklands governor who, 
"based on this fact, was assessing the possibility of extending 
the fishing season and increasing by 10 percent the number of 
fishing licenses to be granted in 1994." 
  The truth, however, is quite different. For a start, we are 
not referring to a "London Treaty," but to a mere fishing 
agreement that may or may not be renewed every year. Secondly, 
in this agreement we have made sure that Great Britain limits to 
150,000 tonnes the amount of fish extracted this season. It 
does not matter where it fishes, either in the new zone 
established by a common agreement with Argentina or in the ones 
previously agreed upon; Great Britain cannot surpass the 
aforementioned amount, and therefore the establishment of the 
FOCZ will not cause any "damage." Moreover, it could well 
benefit Argentine fishing, because every ship the islanders send 
to the new zone will help reduce the number of ships operating 
between the islands and the continent -- up to now the busiest 
zone -- which will clearly benefit Argentine ships and help 
preserve the resources. 
  As for the comment by David Tatham, it by no means entails 
increasing fishing above the 150,000 tonnes ceiling. In spite 
of what the article says, all it does is announce the price they 
will charge for each fishing license and a longer term for each 
permit -- factors related to their commercial policy, always 
within the fixed 150,000 tonnes limit... Argentina, in turn, 
has similar variables, and I would say much better ones than 
what the aforementioned article suggests. Thanks to our 
comparative advantages, better infrastructure, and a growing 
operative efficiency, we can offer licenses for longer periods 
at more attractive prices. This fact, during the past two 
years, has been reflected in clear Argentine leadership in that 
fishing region. 
  Something that is not mentioned in Aguilera's article -- 
which is so gloomy about the government's action -- is that 
right from the beginning of these annual fishing agreements, 
Great Britain has maintained the 150,000 tonne ceiling while the 
Argentine ceiling has done nothing but rise. This year it has 
risen to 220,000 tonnes, which will allow an income equivalent 
to almost half our traditional beef exports. 
  It is also not true that the establishment of the FOCZ will 
be necessarily negative because the preservation zone has been 
turned into an exploitation zone. We are talking about 
renewable resources, where preservation measures are justified 
if fishing reaches the point of depredation. But if the volumes 
set by the two countries do not together threaten the 
preservation of resources, all that is allegedly being preserved 
ends up lost with no benefit accruing to anyone. 
  Every year Argentina and Great Britain carry out joint 
investigations and coordinate their own predictions to 
scientifically assess the total fishing volume within the 
preservation limits. If this coordinated policy determines the 
need to ban fishing in a given zone, this is decided on a yearly 
basis. For the time being the market demand does not threaten 
this resource being exploited jointly. 
  Neither is it true that the fishing boom [preceding word in 
English] represents a true and permanent increase in the 
islanders' income. Quite the contrary, as the very charts 
published by Aguilera show: Since these fishing agreement with 
Argentina were signed, the British volumes have done nothing but 
drop: 44 million pounds in 1991, 40 in 1992, and 31 in 1993. 
  Fishing is, in fact, very important for the islanders (it 
represents 49 percent of their income) and they are perfectly 
aware that maintaining these conditions depends, in the very 
near future, on the good will of Argentine foreign policy and, 
in the long term, of some type of agreement with our country 
that will surpass the not always guaranteed annual renewals of 
agreements signed so far. 
  Aguilera's comment about Heathcoat Amory is opportune. He is 
the second consecutive British minister of state for foreign and 
commonwealth affairs to publicly recommend that the islanders 
seek more significant agreements with our country. 
  It is also true that the profits obtained from fishing will 
generate deep-rooted changes in Falklands society, which sooner 
or later will understand that their best alternative to exploit 
this and other natural resources, and to enter the next century 
with a flourishing economy, unavoidably entails basic agreements 
with the only neighbor God gave them on Earth.

<F P=106> [Article by Jorge Luis Velazquez] </F>
  [Text] Some see the Cavallo Plan as representing doom, 
while for others it means salvation. The Zorraquin group, 
centered in the petrochemical industry, is unable to escape the 
effects of the free fall of international prices and the 
invasion by imported products. In order to stay afloat, it has 
put Saiar, the leader in the production of heating tanks, and 
the jewel of its holding operations, up for sale. Philco, the 
enterprise headed by Jorge Blanco Villegas, the president of the 
UIA [Argentine Industrial Union], represents the other side of 
this coin. It is enjoying the delights of a purchasing rate of 
electrical domestic appliances that continues to rise. And it 
has just bought Peabody in order to enter the freezer market, an 
area from which it had been absent. 
  The Garovaglio-Zorraquin [G &amp; Z] business group, which 
owns 
the Ipako and Polisur petrochemical firms, is looking for ways 
to eliminate ballast in order to stay afloat in the financial 
crisis threatening to submerge it. The most effective method it 
has found has been to eliminate some of its assets. It has left 
some fields and ceased its participation in various 
undertakings. What it has not yet succeeded in doing is to gain 
control of a debt that totals about $150 million. 
  Now it has tacked the "For Sale" sign on the door of another 
of the firms it controls--the Saiar metallurgical company. This 
firm is the leader in the thermotank and heating-system market. 
It holds the license for the U.S. Rheem brand, and as a result 
it invoiced a total of more than 60 million pesos in 1992. 
  Its production activities are distributed between two 
plants. 
The first is located in Quilmes, in Greater Buenos Aires. 
  Although it is called the Iguazu plant, the other is in San 
Luis, where it was built in the heat of the industrial upsurge. 
  Although Saiar was only put up for sale a very short time 
ago, there has already been one principal interested party--the 
owners of the Rheem trademark. But the talks with the North 
Americans soon reached an impasse. The other buyer negotiating 
at the present time is the Chilean Compania Tecno Industrial 
[Technoindustrial Company], the leader in the electrical 
domestic appliance market on the other side of the mountain 
range. It has been learned that this company wants to establish 
itself in Argentina, using Saiar as its base for MERCOSUR 
[Common Market of the South] operations. 
  The Chileans are talking with Associated Merchant Bankers 
(MBA), the firm managed by the Reynal brothers, which represents 
Salomon Brothers in Argentina. It happened that MBA, which 
provides financial advice to G &amp; Z, planned the entire Saiar 
sales operation. It is managing the negotiations with the Bank 
Club with a view to its financing of the debts of the group. 
<H5>  Changes Planned </H5>
  Ipako, the leading G &amp; Z firm, has for several months 
been 
undergoing a drastic adaptation plan. Federico Zorraquin, Jr., 
remained to head the internal reorganization after the entire 
top management of the firm was removed. 
  Strictly speaking, the reorganization of this group began 
earlier. One of the first decisions made was to sell for $8 
million its share (50 percent) of Aluplata, a joint undertaking 
with the Crown firm in the United States for the manufacture of 
lightweight aluminum beverage containers. 
  Other steps in the same direction included the sale of four 
floors of the main building to the Perez Company, deactivation 
of the operations of the Cerro Castillo [Castle Hill] mining 
company, and the sale of some rural properties. 
  Zorraquin's hope of preventing the enterprise from sinking 
hinges on the negotiations with the Bank Club. According to 
spokesmen for the enterprise, an agreement is very close to 
being reached. They do not exclude the possibility that this may 
happen before the end of this month. 
  They say that this agreement would be possible if a contract 
for supplying ethylene to the petrochemical plants could be 
agreed upon first. The Zorraquin people want a price lower than 
Bahia Blanca Petrochemicals (PBB), a mixed enterprise, is 
obtaining for this raw material at present. 
  "It would mean our doom if the agreement were to fall 
through," a spokesman for the group said. If this were to 
happen, according to the enterprise, the group would suffer from 
another drain in addition to that resulting from the financial 
suit against them that was won recently by the PBB requiring 
that Ipako pay off a debt of $30 million. 
  The directors of Ipako are confident. They believe they will 
be able to survive based on the plan for further adjustment and 
refinancing of their debts. However, they immediately add that 
they have no control over the development of international 
prices (now at their lowest point) or the harsh competition 
provided by the petrochemical firms in Brazil, which have 
invaded Argentine territory with the lowest prices in history.

<F P=106> [Article by Luis Ceriotto] </F>
  [Text] The white kingdom of refrigerators and freezers is 
on the move, in length and in breadth. On its flank, the market 
base has expanded. In 1990, 300,000 units per year were being 
sold, while the figure today easily exceeds 600,000. And this 
sector faces an increasingly clearly defined concentration with 
a limited number of brands. Only seven of the 17 brands on the 
market account for 70 percent of the sales. 
  In recent days, the 18th brand has been added, and it seems 
certain to claim the lead for itself. Philco, the reigning 
champion in the television and car-stereo sectors, has now 
ventured into the refrigeration field. It has purchased 30 
percent of Helametal, which produces the Peabody refrigerators. 
But the people at Philco hasten to explain that it is not a 
question of absorbing the firm, but rather of adding to their 
holdings. 
  To speak the truth, the most serious operation took place 
some months ago within Philco itself, when the head of the 
Argentine Industrial Union (UIA), Jorge Blanco Villegas, bought 
37 percent of the company's stock from the Plata Commercial 
Company (Soldati). This package, added to the shares controlled 
by his sister Silvia, gave him control of the stock. 
  Silvia Blanco Villegas is the majority stockholder in 
Inversora Antartica [Antarctic Investments], a company that is 
affiliated with the SOCMA (Francisco Macri's holding company) 
and is the owner of the other 37 percent of the Philco stock. 
The rest of the shares are in the hands of Japan's NEC. 
  Once the president of the UIA had consolidated his control 
of 
Philco, the expansion into the refrigeration sector began. This 
is the sector that has traditionally located its plants in the 
provinces with developing industry. That is the case for 
Helametal itself, which in addition to a plant in Buenos Aires, 
has another in Catamarca. 
  The enterprise is continuing to manufacture Peabody 
refrigerators. This brand has a market share of between eight 
and 10 percent. But it is now also producing the models with 
which Philco reentered the refrigeration sector after an absence 
of almost a quarter of a century (it had produced freezers until 
1970). Six models, five of them domestic, and a more 
sophisticated one imported from Korea, are included. 
  Those responsible for launching the new products are sending 
a kind of double message. On the one hand, they say they spent 
almost $3 million on the advertising campaign, as well as an 
amount they do not want to specify on purchasing the Helametal 
stock. But they will swear to anyone who will listen that they 
did not go into the refrigeration market to beat out the smaller 
or more inexperienced firms. "For us, settling our debts will 
suffice. At least for the time being," Fortunato Gacceta, the 
commercial manager of the firm, says cautiously. 
  We asked how much had been spent on equipment. 
  "About $400,000. The serious investments will come later." 
  They took the competition into account. They know that 
Philco 
is a heavyweight in the so-called "brown line" (televisions and 
video and audio equipment). They take it for granted that when 
they added their refrigeration line, it was not to become one of 
the minor manufacturers, but to fight for the lead. 
  CLARIN asked Daniel Sciaroni, who heads McLean, S.A. 
(Patrick 
and Saccol), if his firm was taken by surprise by Philco's 
action. 
  "We expected it, but we also positioned ourselves. We 
invested $20 million in a new plant, in Caseros, whereby we are 
doubling our production. Between the plant in Caseros and that 
in San Luis, we will be producing 1,500 refrigerators a day 
within a few months." 
  They are saying at McLean, Patrick, and Saccol that 
together, 
they have the lead in a market involving 600,000 refrigerators 
and 200,000 freezers per year. They say that the next most 
important firm is Whirlpool, the multinational North American 
firm that bought its refrigeration line from Philips two years 
ago. But they say that the entry of Philco into the market 
changes the game. 
  "Philco has an industrial strategy, as we do. It produces 
for 
the domestic market, and in addition it exports some of its 
products. Its production will not go unnoticed," a spokesman for 
McLean standing behind his superior said. 
  We asked who would be affected first. 
  "It will surely be the smaller producers. There are 11 
refrigerator brands that, taken together, account for no more 
than 30 percent of the market. One of these firms will surely be 
the first to fall."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Bolivia monitored through 6 
January. 
  The Bolivian Government signed two loan agreements with 
Germany. The first involves a loan for 30 million German marks 
for an electricity grid in La Paz Department. The second is a 2 
million-mark credit for the supply of drinking water in Oruro. 
(La Paz Television Boliviana Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 31 Dec 
93) 
  The Bolivian Central Bank reported that the economy grew 3.2 
percent in 1993, 0.51 percent higher than the previous year. The 
inflation rate for the year's first 11 months was 8.78 percent, 
a drop of 13 percent compared with the similar period last year. 
Net international reserves totalled $345 million, an increase of 
47.8 percent. The 1993 fiscal deficit was 1.4479 billion 
bolivianos, 6.6 percent of the GDP and an increase of 4.7 
percent compared with the previous year. The trade balance 
registered a $501 million deficit. The foreign debt balance 
totaled $3.8 billion through 31 December, an increase of 0.4 
percent compared with the same period last year. The debt 
service was $235 million, an increase of 14 percent. (La Paz LA 
RAZON in Spanish 24 Dec 93 p B3) 
  The National Statistics Institute announced that the 
inflation rate for 1993 was 9.31 percent, which is the lowest in 
the last 17 years. The report also says the GDP grew 3.2 
percent, approximately $4 billion. The institute reported that 
unemployment during 1993 reached 5.4 percent, 60,000 people. (La 
Paz Television Boliviana Network in Spanish 0100 GMT 4 Jan 94)

  [Text] Army Minister Zenildo Zoroastro has ruled out any 
possibility of a coup in Brazil. There is no risk of 
Fujimorization in Brazil, the minister said, noting that 
President Itamar Franco has already said everything that had to 
be said on the subject. 
  The military ministers had thought about releasing a note 
denying the statements by Justice Minister Mauricio Correa. The 
ministers, however, preferred not to promote greater controversy 
on the subject.

  [Excerpt] The Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban) 
reported on 27 December 1993 that it is having problems in 
restarting the collection of the provisional tax on financial 
operations as of January 1994 because the Federal Supreme Court 
(STF) has not published the court decree (in its entirety) of 15 
December 1993 declaring the tax constitutional. 
  In that decision, the Federal Supreme Court established 
several restrictions on collections for entities considered 
immune by the Constitution and for states and municipalities. 
The court decree has not been published yet. 
  The banks allege that the Constitution restricts immunity on 
operations related to the essential activities of those 
entities, and that without the publication of the court 
decision, the banks will not be able to define what operation by 
the same entity is immune. Helio Ramos Dominguez, legal adviser 
for Febraban, said: "It is not up to the banks to define whether 
an operation is related or not to an entity's essential 
activity." 
  On 27 December 1993, the banks sent requests for 
clarification to the Federal Revenue Office and the Central 
Bank. Febraban believes it will be very difficult for the 
Federal Supreme Court to publish its decision before January -- 
the court is in recess and will return to work in February -- 
therefore, it hopes to begin collecting based on the 
clarifications from the two organizations. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Economic Panorama" column by Miriam Leitao] </F>
  [Text] The Central Bank [BC] is behind in its internal debt 
renegotiation schedule by $10 billion. This means that titles 
representing a third of the total internal debt fell due and 
were not sold in the market again. 
  The past two BBC [Central Bank Bond] auctions failed. 
Another 
auction failed in November. The BC has not accepted the market 
interest rate with the argument that it does not want to appear 
to agree with the expectation of a 40-percent inflation rate in 
January. Market agents, in turn, argue that they lost 
approximately $500 million from September to December for 
anticipating rates below the real ones. 
  Pactual Bank economist Paulo Guedes said the $10 billion 
that 
was not renegotiated was "pure nitroglycerine. In theory, that 
money is loose and can go anywhere." 
  "The picture is not good at all," said Pablo Haddad of the 
Garantia Bank. Haddad, a former BC director himself, thinks the 
information available on the economic plan "is not very clear 
and not very consistent," increasing economic agents' 
uncertainty. 
  "The market demands high rates for prefixed titles 
[certificates that earn interest without monetary corrections] 
and looks at post-fixed titles [certificates earning interest 
and monetary corrections] with great mistrust because the index 
can be changed at any time," Paulo Guedes argued. Today the 
Treasury will try to sell NTN's [National Treasury Notes] 
indexed to the foreign exchange rate and the TR [referential 
interest rate]. 
  Whatever the result of today's auction -- it is expected 
that 
the Treasury will be luckier than the BC -- the climate of 
apprehension with which the market reaches the end of the year 
makes us look back with nostalgia to the efforts to extend debt 
payments months ago. At that time the BC was selling bonds with 
six months to one year maturity with increasingly lower interest 
rates. Now debt bonds mature at shorter intervals, interest 
rates are higher, and the uncertainty is greater.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 6 
January. 
  The Mineral Resources Prospecting Company has discovered 
small deposits of platinum in Para, Rondonia, and Minas Gerais 
States for the first time since the company began prospecting in 
1991. This increases the possibility of Brazil becoming a 
platinum-producing nation. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 29 Dec 93 p 13) 
  The National Confederation of Industries reported that 
Brazilian industry will register between a 8.5-9 percent 
"exceptional" increase late in 1993. This performance will 
contribute to increasing the GDP 4.5 percent compared with 1992. 
(Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 30 Dec 93 p 9) 
  Labor Minister Walter Barelli on 30 December reported that 
as 
of 31 December the minimum salary will be 32,882 real cruzeiros, 
nearly $100, with a readjustment 75.28-percent higher than the 
December salary. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 
31 Dec 93 Economy Section p 1) 
  The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, IBGE, 
on 
29 December said the unemployment rate in six Brazilian 
metropolitan regions -- Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Belo 
Horizonte, Salvador, Recife, and Porto Alegre -- was 4.57 
percent in November. This percentage was lower than October's 
4.89 percent and November 1992's 5.82 percent. The IBGE also 
said the number of employed people in the six regions grew from 
15,428,279 to 15,474,639 in October. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL 
in Portuguese 30 Dec 93 p 8)

  [Text] The Army commander in chief, General Augusto 
Pinochet, today visited Defense Minister-designate Edmundo Perez 
Yoma in his home together with four major generals. The visit 
was qualified as a protocol visit. 
  Today at noon, Perez Yoma went to the office of 
President-elect Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle on Hindemburg Street to 
inform him about his meeting with the Army commander. It was a 
cordial meeting, Perez Yoma said, adding that he told Pinochet 
of his intention to maintain extremely good relations with the 
military during the next administration. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Gen. Pinochet 
never 
paid a visit to Defense Minister Rojas. What do you think of 
this? 
  [Perez Yoma] I did not know that, and I greatly appreciate 
the fact that Gen. Pinochet, together with four other generals, 
visited me in my home and presented these major generals to me. 
So I am very happy about it. [end recording] 
  Perez Yoma was asked whether the visit was a demonstration 
of 
Gen. Pinochet's subordination to political power. 
  [Begin Perez Yoma recording] I think Gen. Pinochet has 
demonstrated he is willing to submit to the political power. I 
think his visit expresses his good intentions regarding this 
subject. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Antonio 
Navarro Wolff, presidential candidate of the 19 April Movement 
Democratic Alliance [AD/M-19], today announced that his 
organization will study legal formulas to sue the government for 
permitting the presence of U.S. soldiers in the country. 
  "We will ask the Defense Ministry for a copy of the 
agreement 
signed by the Colombian and U.S. Armies so we can act legally," 
the former guerrilla said. He described the arrival of U.S. 
military engineers in southeastern Valle del Cauca Department as 
"unjustified and a violation [violatoria]." 
  Some 133 military engineers from the Southern Command in 
Panama today began social projects in Valle del Cauca 
Department, the capital of which is Cali. The action has 
created great discontent among political sectors because the 
Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops without 
congressional consent. 
  According to Navarro Wolff, who will run for president in 
the 
May elections, the administration of President Cesar Gaviria "is 
concealing the real mission of the U.S. military contingent." 
The AD/M-19 leader added, "We are following the case as 
citizens." In recent days, Navarro Wolff traveled to the area 
where the foreign soldiers are deployed and gave Colombian flags 
to the residents. 
  The Union of Democratic Workers of Colombia [Sindicato de 
Trabajadores Democraticos de Colombia] joined the protest by 
describing the arrival of the U.S. troops as an "attack on 
national sovereignty." The labor organization stated: "It is 
unacceptable that at the request of the president, Colombia is 
treated like an international beggar and permits the arrival of 
troops in the country under the pretext that they are coming to 
build a school." 
  Gaviria and the Defense Ministry have insisted that the 
soldiers' mission is "humanitarian," and they have ruled out any 
violation of national sovereignty. 
  The U.S. group yesterday began to build a school and a 
health 
center to serve approximately 2,000 people of a tourist area 
near the Colombian Navy's Malaga Bay naval base on the Pacific. 
Official sources indicated that the group will remain in 
Colombia until 28 February, when the projects are scheduled to 
be finished.

<F P=106> [Report by Miriam Ortiz from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Charges leveled by a guerrilla from Arauca on the 
"24 Hours" newscast have confirmed that there is clandestine 
arms trafficking by the Venezuelan Guard to guerrillas of the 
ELN [Army of National Liberation] and the FARC [Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia] in the border area. On 5 January, the 
commander of the Army confirmed this information and said he had 
already given the Venezuelan authorities a list of names of 
Venezuelan soldiers involved in this illegal arms trade. 
  [Begin Army Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman recording, 
identified by caption] The operation we carried out and the 
statements of a guerrilla member produced information that was 
turned over to the Prosecutor's Office. If you want names, I can 
tell you that I cannot reveal them because this case is now the 
responsibility of the Venezuelan authorities. [end recording] 
  The "24 Hours" newscast, however, learned that the following 
Venezuelan soldiers are involved: Colonel Montes, Guard 
Escalante, and Inspectors Ramos and Nunez. We also learned that 
the Venezuelan Government is investigating certain reports that 
many Venezuelan soldiers and guards offer protection to 
Colombian guerrillas. Gen. Guzman also confirmed that there are 
constant exchanges between Venezuelan subversives and Colombia's 
ELN. 
  [Begin Guzman recording] We know that certain guerrillas, 
especially those in the ELN, have crossed the border to give 
training on the Venezuelan side. [end recording] 
  The Army commander added that although it is impossible to 
control the 2,219 km borderline, the necessary measures were 
implemented in coordination with the Venezuelan Army.

  [Text] Interior Minister Juan Briones Davila did not deny 
the existence of a small terrorist group in the country. He 
also announced the arrest of four alleged rebels accused of 
carrying out the attacks at the Lima Mayor's Office and the Air 
Force installations. 
  [Begin recording] [Briones] No, we cannot discount the 
possibility of another small group and -- I repeat -- a small 
group. We do recommend that they take the appropriate measures, 
because the terrorism law is very strict. I would not like 
anyone to claim later that we acted too drastically with them. 
At this time I think we should say -- and I would like to end 
with this -- that we will continue our counterterrorism 
operations. We want to finish this once and for all, arrest all 
those involved in the recent terrorist actions, and punish them 
with the full force of the law. We will keep working until we 
attain complete peace in the country. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Are any suspects under arrest? 
  [Briones] At this time we are still investigating. There 
have been a few arrests. 
  [Reporter] How many? 
  [Briones] We now have about four people in custody. They are 
important people within their organizations. We continue to 
investigate, and we expect to see some results soon. 
  [Reporter] Are these people members of Shining Path or the 
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement? 
  [Briones] The people we have arrested are members of Shining 
Path. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Peruvian Army Colonel Jose Bailetti, </F>
retired, president of the Institute for National Defense 
Research, Iniden, by Victor Andres Ponce; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Ponce] How do you interpret the latest actions of 
the Shining Path [SL]? 
  [Bailetti] If one considers the letters of [SL leader 
Abimael] Guzman, which almost admit surrender, and reviews the 
last letter, signed by Abimael and four [SL] Central Committee 
members, one can see that the terrorist group is obviously 
breaking into factions. Since this organization began its 
bloody war, the appearance of a dissident group represents an 
unprecedented move... 
  [Ponce] Who would be heading this dissident group? 
  [Bailetti] It could be that this group would be headed by 
Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand (Feliciano) ["Comrade Feliciano"]... 
  [Ponce] Are there any clues in this regard? 
  [Bailetti] Police work will confirm this possibility. 
  [Ponce] Do the actions by the SL in Lima follow the 
activities of the four zonal committees? 
  [Bailetti] This is true. Following the capture of the SL top 
leaders, the terrorist group established four zonal committees 
in each one of Lima's cones [conos]. The SL actions in Ancash 
Department are also significant. Its December actions confirm 
this. Another group continues to be active in Satipo Province in 
the Ene Valley zone... 
  [Ponce] Are there any differences between the latest SL 
actions and those commanded by Guzman? 
  [Bailetti] The main difference is that today's SL people 
have 
diminished economic resources because they are no longer 
financed by drug traffickers. The Huallaga committee has been 
acting on its own for a long time. The Huallaga committee and 
the traffickers are currently moving toward the south of our 
country on the Aguaytia-Ene Valley axis. 
  [Ponce] From the way you describe the situation, Guzman has 
not been heeded by the majority of the militants who are free? 
  [Bailetti] This is not necessarily true. Some 180 SL 
militants killed three SL leaders and then surrendered under the 
Repentance Law in the Sello de Oro zone in Ayacucho Department. 
  [Ponce] What is your prognosis for the future of the SL? 
  [Bailetti] I believe it will break into three factions: The 
Huallaga militants, who are moving to the south as drug 
traffickers also move in that direction; those who will continue 
with their armed actions; and, finally, those who will obey 
Guzman's call. 
  [Ponce] So, what is the balance of the negotiations between 
the government and Guzman? 
  [Bailetti] There is no room for any negotiation here. We are 
facing a decimated, cornered, and penniless force. There is 
nothing to compare the situation that once prevailed in Colombia 
or El Salvador where negotiations were a national necessity.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 6 
January. 
  The Inter-American Development Bank on 22 December 1993 
agreed to a $100 million loan for projects to be implemented by 
the National Compensation and Social Development Fund. (Lima EL 
PERUANO in Spanish 23 Dec 93 p B1) 
  The Agriculture Ministry reported that agriculture and 
livestock production increased 9.6 percent in November compared 
with the same month last year. The accumulated production in the 
year's first 11 months was 5.4-percent higher than the same 
period last year. Agriculture production was 9.4-percent higher 
between January and November and livestock 2.2 percent. (Lima EL 
PERUANO in Spanish 23 Dec 93 p B3) 
  Foreign investment in 1993 was $1.557 billion, an increase 
of 
$265.01 million compared with 1990. The National Commission for 
Foreign Investments and Technology reported that the biggest 
increases were in mining with 35.28 percent, followed by 
industries with 32.73 percent, commerce with 13.21 percent, and 
finance with 11.10 percent. Foreign investment in the stock 
exchange went from $360 million in 1992 to $1.17 billion in 
1993. (Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 24 Dec 93 p A2) 
  On 28 December, the congressional Energy Committee approved 
a 
draft bill on privatizating the Peruvian Telephone Company, CPT, 
and the National Telecommunications Enterprise of Peru, 
Entelperu. The state decided to sell 20 percent of its shares in 
CPT and 15 percent of Entelperu. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 29 Dec

  [Text] Government spokesmen last night harshly questioned 
the joint declaration signed a few hours earlier by the 
Uruguayan Chamber of Industries (CIU) and the Interunion Workers 
Plenum - National Workers Convention (PIT-CNT), saying that the 
organizations "seem to be speaking of another country." 
  A qualified Executive Branch source told BUSQUEDA: "It is 
remarkable that they should speak of unemployment when the 
unemployment rate is historically at its lowest (...), that they 
should speak of a lack of investment when for the past two years 
the investment levels have been at their highest for the past 
two decades (...), that businessmen and union leaders should 
sign a joint declaration that contains many demands which 
contradict their own interests." 
  The CIU and PIT-CNT declaration states: "The industrial 
sector in Uruguay is being considerably dismantled," with the 
resultant "loss of dozens of jobs in the past few years," to the 
point where "industrial participation in national production has 
reached the levels of the 1940's." 
  Businessmen and union leaders questioned the government 
trade 
policy which seeks "a unilateral opening when protectionism and 
incentives for internal production are increasing in the rest of 
the world." 
  The government spokesmen stated: "The average unemployment 
rate in Uruguay during 1993 is 8.4 percent, the lowest since 
1981," adding: "The jobs lost in some sectors were replaced in 
others." 
  As for the "lack of investment" mentioned in the 
declaration, 
the government says: "It is remarkable that the PIT-CNT -- which 
is associated with the CIU -- should speak of a lack of 
investment when on 13 December 1992 it contributed to frustrate 
one of the largest investments that could have been made in 
Uruguay." 
  The government considers the attitude of these two 
organizations to be contradictory because "they speak of 
improving the competitiveness, while some of the solutions they 
propose will really reduce the purchasing power of the workers." 
  The Executive Branch spokesmen said: "It is also remarkable 
that, just like on 13 December 1992, the workers oppose 
transformations that would help to improve the efficiency of 
public services, which could help to improve the competitiveness 
of the productive sectors."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 6 
January. 
  The Central Bank reported that the balance of payments in 
the 
year's first nine months registered a $166.7 million profit, 
including a $313.3 million deficit in the current account and a 
$480 million surplus in the capital account. The Central Bank's 
net international reserves rose $197.4 million from January to 
September 1993. (Montevideo LA MANANA in Spanish 23 Dec 93 p 47) 
  On 22 December 1993, the Central Bank reported that the GDP 
increased 1.2 percent from January to September 1993 compared 
with the same period in 1992. Agriculture and livestock

Spanish 31 Dec 93 p 47) 
  The Central Bank reported that the December devaluation rate 
was 2.0323 percent and the accrued devaluation rate for 1993 was

  The Central Bank on 3 January reported that the public 
sector's net foreign debt was $1.8614 billion through 31 October 
1993, a drop of 6 percent in the year's first 10 months compared 
with 1992. The public sector's gross foreign debt was $4.2046 
billion in the year's first 10 months, an increase of 1.7 
percent. Gross international reserves were $2.1787 billion 
through October 1993. The gross foreign debt in September was 
$4.2047 billion, a drop of $100,000. (Montevideo LA MANANA in

compared with the same month in 1992 when it was 3.28 percent.

and President Luis Alberto Lacalle on 27 December 1993 signed a 
$38 million loan agreement to implement health projects in the 
Rincon de la Bolsa area, San Jose Department. Later they signed 
a $28 million loan agreement to improve the Labor University of 
Uruguay's technical education. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR

<F P=106> [Report by Richard Simon] </F>
  [Text] St. George's, Grenada, 6 Jan, CANA -- As was widely 
expected, personal income tax was reintroduced in Grenada on 
Thursday when prime minister and minister of finance, Nicholas 
Brathwaite, presented the government's 1994 budget. 
  Brathwaite, in a two-hour-long speech to the House of 
Representatives, also heeded calls from the chief of customs, 
geoff Thorne, and moved to crack a vibrant contraband trade 
between Grenada and the sister island, Carriacou. 
  The measures included steep reductions in port charges on 
home appliances, audio and video cassette tapes, computer 
diskettes, wines and spirits, and a big cut in duties on cigars 
and cigarettes. 
  "As a result of these changes, the prices of these items 
will 
fall significantly," Brathwaite told the House, making clear the 
measures were intended to fight the contraband trade. 
  The budget of 278 million dollars (one EC dollar ; 37 cents 
US) puts recurrent expenditure at 195 million dollars and 
capital expenditure at 82.7 million dollars. 
  Total revenue, including grants, was projected 266.5 million 
dollars, leaving a deficit of 12.5 million dollars to be 
financed. 
  The reintroduction of personal income tax, abolished in 1986 
and replaced with a value-added tax (VAT), accompanied other tax 
reform measures. 
  VAT was downgraded to a consumption tax, and two tier system 
of company tax was introduced for one year. On profits of 
45,000 dollars and lower, a rate of 30 per cent will apply while 
on profits above 45,000 dollars, the rate will be 35 per cent. 
From 1995, a single rate of 30 per cent will apply. 
  Said Brathwaite: "Over the past years, our tax system had 
become too complicated to administer as a result of improperly 
drawn and frequently amended legislation, nuisance taxes and the 
decay of tax administration itself." 
  The budget brought property tax relief for home owners who 
from 1985 paid rates of 0.2 per cent of the value of the land 
and 0.5 per cent of the value of buildings. A single rate of 
0.2 per cent now applies on the value of the property. 
  Under the new system of income tax, the first 10,000 dollars 
of income will be exempt. There is an allowance of 1,000 
dollars for spouses and 1,500 dollars per child up to three 
children. 
  Income tax is seen by the government as a gradual 
replacement 
for a two year old national debt service levy, which will come 
to an end on March 31, 1995. 
  Reviewing the performance of the government's finances, 
Brathwaite reported a current account surplus of 17 million 
dollars, the first in five years. It was arrived at using 
methods employed by the International Monetary Fund and other 
international lending agencies. 
  The largest chunk of the 1994 budget went to the Ministry of 
Communications and Works, reflecting the emphasis the government 
is giving to improving the infrastructure over the coming year.

  [Text] National Front for Change and Democracy Deputy Evans 
Picault labels President Aristide's initiative to convene a 
conference on the refugees' problems demagogy. This is the wrong 
approach, the elected representative of Saint-Marc claims. 
Deputy Picault explains that "Operation Iron Cuts Iron" 
[Operasyon Fe Koupe Fe], launched by the president of the 
Republic [in his message to the people on the Voice of America 
on 1 January], will only exacerbate passions. 
  [Begin Picault recording, in Creole] Given the approach 
President Aristide has taken in saying that the conference 
should be held in Miami, in speaking of an international 
conference, with all due respect for him as president I can say 
I think the route he has taken is a demagogic one. I think the 
way he has taken is a demagogic way. President Aristide wants to 
play a stalling game just as the international community is 
doing, because he knows very well that it does not want to take 
any real measures to bring him back. I cannot support such an 
initiative because it offers no solution to the country's crisis. 
  Secondly: President Aristide said in a speech, "Iron cuts 
iron." I think these are gratuitous, rash statements and that 
when he makes such statements, he just gets on people's nerves, 
driving those who are supposed to carry heavy weapons to commit 
even more repression against the people who are supposed to side 
with him. [end recording]

toward the restoration of democracy in Haiti. Daly Valet reports: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Valet] The meeting of the U.S. 
ambassador and the Office of the Senate of the Republic focused 
on the political crisis the country has experiencied since 30 
September 1991. During this meeting, the U.S. diplomat 
reaffirmed the Clinton administration's support for the 
Governors Island agreement, an agreement which still remains -- 
willy-nilly -- the sole valid framework for resolution of the 
political crisis, according to the U.S. ambassador. 
  Senate Vice President Serge Joseph, who participated in this 
meeting, says he is very satisfied with the fact that the U.S. 
ambassador gave formal guarantees that the Clinton 
administration will continue working toward the return of 
democracy to Haiti. 
  [Joseph] The ambassador and political [word indistinct] who 
were with him, as well as we, the members of the Office, are 
satistified, satisfied [repeats] in the sense that, according to 
the ambassador, the Governors Island agreement is valid until 
something that can replace the agreement can be found. But he 
has formally declared that as long as there is nothing to 
replace the Governors Island agreement, his government will 
stick to the agreement. 
  [Valet] During a news conference after the meeting with the 
U.S. ambassador, Senator Serge Joseph, just back from the United 
States, gave an explanation about the retirement letter 
President Aristide sent to General Cedras. Sen. Joseph explained 
that it was not a letter of dismissal but of retirement, as 
requested of the president by Gen. Cedras in a letter dated 14 
October 1993. [passage omitted] 
  A source close to President Aristide in the Haitian Embassy 
in Washington offered the same explanation as Sen. Joseph. In a 
telephone conversation, he told us that it was never a question 
of dismissing Gen. Cedras. According to our source, President 
Aristide was simply replying to Gen. Cedras, who had written him 
on 14 October to request early retirement. [end recording]

  [Text] In a communique, hundreds of leading Colorado Party 
members stated yesterday that the communique issued by party 
president Blas N. Riquelme on 5 January does not reflect the 
political will of the Colorado people. The document charges 
Riquelme with violating the party bylaws and with being "too 
anxious" to participate in the government to the point of 
neglecting the party's institutional affairs. Riquelme is also 
criticized for being unaware of the president's constitutional 
powers and of the role he must perform as party chairman. 
  The document criticizing Riquelme's political actions was 
released at Mburuvicha Roga [Wasmosy's official residence] after 
a meeting between the president and Colorado leaders. The 
meeting was attended by cabinet ministers, members of the 
party's executive board, heads of state-owned companies, and 
other government officials who conveyed their support to Wasmosy 
and described as inappropriate Riquelme's anger over the 
dismissal of Antelco [National Telecommunications 
Administration] officials. 
  The communique states that the crisis provoked by Riquelme's 
reaction to the reshuffling of senior Antelco officials by the 
Executive Branch "shows with unmistakable clarity that Mr. 
Riquelme believes he owns the party, and that he is not only 
unaware of the president's constitutional powers but also of the 
role a ruling political party can and must play." 
  The document, which was signed by hundreds of party members, 
charges the party chairman with having failed to observe the 
party bylaws, with overlooking the institutional procedures 
established therein, and with acting on behalf of the party 
"only when he feels like it and often to address matters that 
had not been discussed earlier by the Colorado executive board, 
of which he must be the leader and the spokesman." 
  The communique adds: "In light of these circumstances, in 
which the party president is so anxious to participate in the 
government to the point of neglecting the party's institutional 
affairs, we -- members of the executive board, congressmen, 
heads of precincts, mayors, councilmen, governors and members of 
departmental boards; leaders of women, youth, professional, 
peasant, and labor organizations -- hereby assume the essential 
and urgent responsibility of clearly explaining that the 
communique released by Mr. Riquelme does not reflect either the 
political will of the executive board or of the Colorado people." 
  The communique notes that, in a special session, full 
members 
of the Colorado executive board -- many of whom signed the 
communique -- will propose that the board consider the actions 
and communique signed by Riquelme. 
  The communique adds: "We, the undersigned, hereby express 
their full support for the government of President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy, based on their conviction that his government 
represents the Colorado proposal of promoting national interests 
as presented to the people by the Wasmosy-Seifart ticket."

  [Text] The reverberations of the feud between President 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Blas N. Riquelme, chairman of the ANR's 
[National Republican Association -- Colorado Party] Executive 
Board took an unexpected turn on 5 January when the latter 
disclosed lurid details of the executive head of state's 
candidacy. 
  Riquelme acknowledged that Wasmosy's candidacy had been 
imposed on the ANR. His verbatim remarks reveal information 
that could have unsuspected implications in shedding light on 
Wasmosy's controversial victory, first in the ANR's presidential 
primaries and then in the general election. 
  Riquelme said: "[Wasmosy's] presidential candidacy was 
imposed on me. It was imposed on me one evening while he was 
present there. I cried because it was an imposition, which was 
not prompted by him but rather by the Colorado Party. It is a 
long story. He has to give me credit for that event, namely 
that I was obliged to accept a candidate whose acceptability on 
the part of my fellow party members, the people, was going to be 
difficult for me to obtain." 
  He added that Colorado Party members who accepted this 
situation "did everything possible" so the imposed candidate 
would stand a chance in the elections. 
  "We worked our fingers to the bone and we won the elections. 
We won the elections but he never says Riquelme helped me, but 
rather `he shed tears when my candidacy was imposed on him.' 
Wasmosy lacks the virtue of standing up for us. If I were to 
disclose everything that was done to win, but I would not like 
to discuss that," he stated. 
  The Colorado Party chairman also warned that this "is the 
most serious crisis of all, and is sure not to be the most 
serious or the last one because others may occur." 
<H5>  The Brother-in-Law's Affair </H5>
  With regard to the dismissal of his brother-in-law, Jose 
Luis 
Yanez Zelada, who was an adviser to Antelco [National 
Telecommunications Administration], Riquelme stated: "That is 
the excuse those gentlemen have got hold of to justify my 
annoyance. All the ministers and people close to (Wasmosy) are 
the ones to blame for this. They have voiced this opinion just 
to make their boss happy, to give him satisfaction." 
  "This situation (of friction with the head of state) did not 
happen overnight," he said, adding: "It has been dragging on 
for a long time -- since the beginning, even since the first 
appointments (of ministers) that were made within the new 
administration, and Colorado Party members are well aware of 
this." 
  Riquelme added: "The replacement of Antelco's administration 
had already been agreed upon in early December. I spoke to Mr. 
Wasmosy because I am the chairman of the Colorado Party, which 
props up his political stability." 
  "I told him that he had to exercise extreme caution 
concerning Antelco because its managers -- and the financial 
statements speak for themselves -- have done a great job of 
administration, a very positive one, which generated a 
700-percent surplus," he added. 
  "But after many comings and goings, yesterday (4 January), I 
asked the president to produce some evidence that would explain 
why he was concerned about Antelco's management and support his 
contention that the company's management was an utter failure. 
I told him the management was not a failure, that to the 
contrary, it was good. Long after, when he was ready to fire 
that gentleman, I telephoned him at 1030 (on 4 January) and told 
him that I wanted to talk to him about loyalty, a loyalty I do 
not know whether I will continue to have to him. He told me to 
see him at noon, and I arrived on the dot," he said. 
  "I told him: Mr. President, you did something I had not 
expected. And he answered me: But Riquelme!, you have been 
misinformed. It is Kishi [Colonel Eduardo Kishi, the chairman 
of Antelco's Board of Directors] whom I have given the sack. I 
have not sacked your brother-in-law," noted the Colorado Party 
chairman. 
  Riquelme added: "I answered him that my problem had nothing 
to do with my brother-in-law but rather that it lay in a party 
issue, a national one, and that Antelco's managers were working 
in an honorable way and the problem was that Kishi was being 
laid off on the grounds that he was a bad manager and that was 
not true." 
  "Furthermore, Wasmosy said he was going to privatize Antelco 
and the Colorado Party was against it. I do not oppose the 
privatization of deficit-ridden state enterprises, but I do not 
understand why we should privatize a company that is doing well, 
is yielding good returns, and has a good manager, for whom I 
would go to the stake. I challenge them to prove I am wrong," 
he said. 
  Riquelme added: "Kishi is a loyal man. When Wasmosy planned 
to become president, Kishi was one of the people who helped him 
come to power." 
  Riquelme stated: "This is why I am angry. It is not on 
account of my brother-in-law's dismissal. That excuse has been 
concocted by the gentlemen (the ministers) who do not know a 
thing about politics and who have climbed so high that now they 
are fighting tooth and nail to remain in their posts. They want 
to justify what is unjustifiable. They want Riquelme to leave, 
they want to get rid of him so the Executive Board will be at 
the beck and call of one person's whims, of one person's bad 
character (like Wasmosy's). It is precisely against this state 
of affairs that I am struggling." 
<H5>  The Top Leader Says He Will Not Resign </H5>
  Concerning the controversy with President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy, Colorado Party Chairman Blas N. Riquelme on 5 January 
categorically stated that he will not resign from office and 
asserted that he will keep battling on and "enduring whatever 
may happen" to defend the ideals of the party he heads. 
Riquelme said it is most regrettable that the president had 
crossed Antelco's management out with a stroke of his pen 
because he suspected they were dishonest. 
  "I will have to put up with whatever happens because we are 
in a democracy and the president has the right to manage 
institutions the way he thinks fit," he said. 
  "After all, sooner or later we will have to hold talks again 
in order to govern the country because I am the chairman of the 
party that politically buttresses and guides the government," he 
pointed out. "In short, I will surely continue here at the 
Executive Board and will continue struggling along because those 
people, those close to the president, who ill advise him, are 
seeking to make Riquelme sever his connection with the Colorado 
Party, but that will not happen." 
  With regard to the latest controversy with Wasmosy, Riquelme 
said: "The list of things that I have publicized is something I 
had been putting up with for a long time because I have 
prostrated myself at his feet to keep him (Wasmosy) company, to 
plead with him, to go to his home, to greet him and offer him 
solidarity. And to cap it all, he fires a cannon ball at us. I 
do not say that he should not do these things, but he ought to 
tell us, Colorado Party members, so we can come to a decision by 
consensus." 
  Riquelme told the executive head of state: "You are 
responsible for the government and, as you say, have your own 
fountain pen and you are the owner of your fountain pen, but 
don't you think you can drop your own fountain pen if the party 
withdraws its support?"

  [Text] Assessing 1993, Feprinco [Federation for Production, 
Industry, and Trade] President Cesar Avalos, who represents 
trade, yesterday said: "The state apparatus has not been 
rationalized. On the contrary, there is a continuous increase 
in the number of public employees while corruption and smuggling 
have not been correctly controlled through strong and persistent 
measures, so they prevail freely and stronger than ever." 
  Avalos delivered his year-end message to almost 100 
businessmen. He said that since 1989, following the coup d'etat, 
the country has been living an eminently political environment 
with an almost total absence of an economic policy to guide the 
nation. "It seems as if the natural agents -- the politicians 
-- were dazed, insensible to the citizens' demands," he said. 
  Avalos stated, however, that the government cannot be asked 
for immediate solutions to all problems affecting the country 
because many are subject to factors that are not under its 
control. 
  "We believe the government can achieve many immediate 
solutions through simple political decisions that are being 
unjustifiably postponed, like the privatization of state 
companies, the ban on smuggling, and the eradication of 
corruption in public businesses," he said. 
  He added that state expenditures must be rationalized, that 
private economic activity must be deregulated, and that the 
government must establish an honest and upright Judicial Branch. 
He called for adequate legislation for employer-labor 
relations, the eradication of criminal violence so as to allow 
investments, a climate of security and the promotion of 
industrial, agricultural, and livestock development. 
  Avalos said: "We must also mention the seriousness of 
certain 
events which are taking place in the countryside and in the 
cities with increasingly frequency, which tend to aggravate and 
which require the urgent attention of the national authorities." 
  He added: "I am talking about criminal and vandalistic 
actions in addition to cattle stealing, the clandestine 
occupation of land, and recently to robberies from commercial 
establishments and from people." 
  The trade representative added that in addition to 
surreptitious and covert actions, "people are being openly 
incited to violence by leaders of union organizations which 
should operate moderately and with the required prudence to 
contribute to our social peace; not with the arrogance and 
impudence to weaken it." 
  He added that facing this situation, Feprinco publicly 
assumes the commitment of adjusting its objectives, actions, and 
doctrine on norms and procedures that seek to facilitate a 
peaceful coexistence among all Paraguayans in the quest for a 
more just and worthy society which is more sensible to its 
needs. He said he expects this attitude will be endorsed by the 
national government. 
  Another issue that worries Feprinco and which was reflected 
in the year-end message is unemployment which at this moment 
reaches approximately 12 percent of the economically active 
population (those older than 10 years of age who participate in 
the labor market or seek employment). 
  He added that some 300,000 people are underemployed. This is 
reflected in the landless peasants, the increase in the number 
of poor people, and the massive exodus of workers to neighboring 
countries. 
  One of the aspects considered worrisome is the continuous 
increase in the economically active population. Some 50,000 new 
workers annually seek work but are not absorbed by the labor 
market. 
  Feprinco also criticized the current labor code, which in 
the opinion if its leaders, is inflexible, excessively 
regulatory, and contains rigid dispositions regarding the 
minimum salary, job security, compensations, and a variety of 
social contributions that are "almost alien" to the country's 
reality. 
  It warned that small- and medium-sized companies, which make 
up 90 percent of the productive apparatus, will be the hardest 
hit and, as a result, will be adversely affected. This 
situation will ultimately harm any possibility of modernizing 
and restructuring local industries. 
  Feprinco President Cesar Avalos said: "We once again call on 
legislators to consider these aspects objectively and 
rationally, and urge them to design a labor code that will 
encourage social and economic development instead of slowing it 
down." 
  The Feprinco president stressed that the rate of economic 
growth has decreased; during 1992 it only was 1.7 percent. He 
stated that the slowdown is not purely accidental -- prompted by 
adverse international prices or climatic circumstances -- but 
that it is also due to structural difficulties. 
  He said that prospects for next year, however, look brighter 
because of the recovery -- in volume and quality -- of our most 
important agricultural products, which alone will not be enough 
to totally alleviate the country's great needs. He estimated 
that next year the GDP will grow by 3.7 percent. 
  The report stresses that agriculture, in spite of the low 
productivity, continues to be the basic pillar of the country's 
economy and is possibly the single element that might encourage 
growth. 
  The Feprinco president believes the increase in the minimum 
salary that follows a cost of living increase will not solve the 
problem of the purchasing power of the workers. 
  According to yesterday's Feprinco year-end message: "An 
increase based on that variable alone merely increases the 
inflationary process, which has an immediate impact on workers' 
interests." 
  The report adds that minimum economic stability is 
absolutely 
necessary to inject dynamism to the productive apparatus and to 
improve productivity. 
  "Only then we will stop salary increases from being 
incorporated into consumer prices and we will increase the 
purchasing power of the workers, which is also in the best 
interest of the business community" the report adds. 
  Feprinco recognizes that the economic situation is not good 
at this time and that this can be clearly seen in the strong 
deterioration of our balance of trade which this year ended with 
a deficit of $500 million. The document says that the deficit 
is caused by the quantity, volume, and value of our exports and 
the increased volume of imported goods. 
  The report stresses: "Within this social and economic 
picture, entrepreneurs warn of the dangers of not defining a 
firm and adequate government economic policy." 
  In another part of the long message, the Feprinco president 
warns against revoking the successful anti-inflationary 
government policy. The document adds that inflation is 
resurging and it is presently estimated at around 20 percent 
because of the fiscal deficit. 
  The indications that inflation might increase in 1994 -- as 
a 
consequence of Central Bank short-term loans to the Finance 
Ministry to cover for delays in collecting Itaipu royalties and 
tax collections deficits -- is seen as quite worrisome. 
  The report mentions that the dollar exchange rate has passed 
1,800 guaranies per dollar and continues to rise. The report 
says that the reimplementation of the policy of bank discounts 
to finance agriculture exports; increases in utility rates, 
public transport fares, and salaries; and the imminent increase 
in oil-derived gasoline prices will negatively affect the 
national economic picture. 
  The report states that tax revenue will not cover 
expenditures and so the budget includes, among its revenues, 
resources from abroad in the form of loans and royalties. 
  The document stresses that the problem with that situation 
is 
that such resources are reportedly earmarked to finance "very 
expensive" current expenditures instead of being used to finance 
capital expenditures, when the advisable thing would be to use 
that money to finance infrastructure or to promote production. 
  The report warns that if the Finance Ministry uses Central 
Bank short-term financial credits to compensate for the 
shortfall arising from uncollected and overdue Itaipu royalties 
and did not repay them on time, it could create an inflationary 
process. 
  At one point in the year-end message, the Feprinco president 
stated that in spite of all its good intentions, the current 
administration is discharging its duties erratically. 
  He said he believes the appropriate conditions for solving 
the problems confronting the country go beyond achieving a mere 
macroeconomic balance. He said they should seek to modernize 
the agroindustrial sector and thus increase the competitiveness 
of our products on the international market. 
  The Feprinco president contended that agricultural producers 
must step up production, but to do so they need to be motivated 
by good returns and receive economic and technological support. 
  He said: "Industrialists need government support to defend 
domestic production -- not by raising protectionist barriers 
that favor costly or inefficient industries, but by 
strengthening nascent industries." 
  The Feprinco president pointed out that businessmen should 
end the preferential tax treatment they receive and reduce costs 
by updating their productive techniques. 
  With regard to the industrial fund, the Feprinco report 
states that this is a long-standing demand of the sector made 
through the UIP [Paraguayan Industrial Union] and Feprinco. 
This project is in the initial stages and $300 million will 
reportedly be received in foreign aid to fund investments and to 
enlarge, complement, and streamline manufacturing industries. 
  The Feprinco president stated that the peasants' fund seeks, 
among other things, to reduce the cost of credit intermediation 
for agricultural producers who currently pay up to 90 percent in 
interest rates, to organize producers into cooperatives, and to 
create and strengthen intermediate rural organizations. 
  The Feprinco report states that although there are tax 
incentives for foreign investors, risk factors cancel the 
financial advantages. These risks include the lack of 
macroeconomic credibility and the lack of security with regard 
to respect for private property, the eradication of crime, and 
an independent and efficient judicial system.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Paraguay monitored through 6 
January. 
  On 30 December 1993, Central Bank President Jacinto 
Estigarribia Mallada reported that the Consumer Price Index 
increased 1.2 percent in December and the total inflation rate 
for 1993 was 20.4 percent. In 1992 and 1991 it was 17.8 percent 
and 11.8 percent, respectively. He also said the GDP registered 
a real increase of 3.7 percent and the trade balance deficit was 
$606 million. He added that net international reserves total 
$700 million, 15-percent higher than December 1992. He said the 
net balance of the foreign public debt was approximately $1.227 
billion, a drop of 1.8 percent compared with 1992. (Asuncion ABC 
COLOR in Spanish 31 Dec 93 p 21) 
  On 4 January, the government announced the readjustment of 
public services rates. Electricity increased 16.6 percent; 
water, 40 percent; telephone bills, 44 percent; and the minimum 
salary, 15 percent. The official price of fuel was increased as 
follows: regular gasoline is now 760 guaranies per liter, a 
14-percent increase; premium gasoline is now 840 guaranies per 
liter, a 10.5-percent increase; and gas oil is now 550 guaranies 
per liter, a 14.5-percent increase. (Asuncion ULTIMA HORA in 
Spanish 4 Jan 94 p 1)

  [Text] Cuban Ambassador to Mexico Jose Fernandez de Cossio 
Rodriguez has said that a strong, stable, and prosperous Mexico 
is important for the Cuban people. Fernandez de Cossio made 
this statement to the Mexican press when asked about the 
situation in Chiapas State. PRENSA LATINA reported that the 
Cuban diplomat in Mexico said that the Chiapas State incident is 
strictly a domestic matter and that the Cuban Government 
supports all efforts being made to find a peaceful solution to 
the problem. Regarding specific charges aimed at linking Cuba 
with the so-called Zapatist Army of National Liberation [EZLN], 
Fernandez de Cossio said that they are groundless. The 
ambassador said that those making these charges only want to 
cast a shadow on the relations between Mexico and Cuba, adding 
that, for the longest time, these relations have been based on 
the principle of non-intervention.

<F P=106> [Barbara Bethancourt report on interview with Foreign </F>
Minister Roberto Robaina by unidentified reporter; place and 
date not given; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] A year in which Cuban foreign policy gained new 
opportunities has been left behind. The reestablishment of 
relations with Colombia, a tour through the Caribbean, and 
participation in important international meetings were some of 
the Cuban Foreign Ministry's activities in the year that has 
just concluded and which characterizes the work that will be 
maintained in the new year. As a matter of fact, Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina will soon begin a tour of the African 
nations. 
  [Robaina] At the invitation of several Foreign Ministries, I 
will visit five African countries in early January. 
  [Reporter] Which countries? 
  [Robaina] I will visit Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, Ghana, 
and [name indistinct] [end recording] 
  Robaina did not rule out a visit to Spain and to other 
European countries this year. 
  [Robaina] We have another invitation, but I do not know if I 
will be able to attend in early January. I believe that at the 
invitation of Spain, I will visit that country and other 
European countries that [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] Are you going to [words indistinct]? 
  [Robaina] Well, I believe there are also possibilities for a 
visit there, but right now I think the invitation made by the 
president of our parliament is much more important. I do not 
think I will have time to visit other places until I complete my 
visits in Africa and Latin America. Besides, we need many 
things here, and I have not seen you for a long time because I 
have been abroad. I want to be here to share with you what I am 
doing here and abroad. 
  [Reporter] Will you go on your Latin American tour during 
the 
first six months of 1994? 
  [Robaina] Yes, the Foreign Ministry has much work to do in 
the first six months of 1994. Please keep in mind that it is 
not just the minister who has to work hard when there is a lot 
of work at the Foreign Ministry. The vice ministers are working 
in their respective areas. We must continue working on what we 
started in the Caribbean and do it with the same enthusiasm in 
Latin America. 
  For many reasons with which you are familiar, we will work 
on 
Africa and Europe in the first six months. We cannot do more in 
that time because as you know, we have two very important 
events. One is the creation of the Association of Caribbean 
States [Asociacion de Estados Caribenos], and the other is the 
Latin American Summit to be held in Cartagena in June. This 
will give us plenty of work during the first six months of the 
year. 
  A conference on immigration and the Cuban situation will 
also 
be held during the first six months of 1994 in Havana. This is 
a continuation of the dialogue between the Cubans of the island 
and those residing in other countries. Since this meeting is 
being questioned by some anti-Cuban organizations, we asked 
Robaina for his opinion. 
  [Robaina] It surprises me how some people are talking about 
an invitation that was never made to them. That really 
surprises me. In other words, I would like to know who says 
those people were invited to the meeting. I hear them saying 
that they accept the invitation and are preparing documents. 
They even talk about a vague proposal by the Cuban foreign 
minister. They say that the true and only dialogue was the one 
made by (?Platform) I don't know how many years ago. Apparently 
the people saying these things have very little else to do. 
  I feel that the rules of the game for the conference to be 
held in Cuba during the first months of next year are very clear 
and have not changed. They are based on absolute respect, 
mutual understanding, and sharing our (?project). The agenda 
will cover immigration and family issues, which is what concerns 
us. Anyone who tries to impose a political agenda on us is 
wasting his time. 
  I do not think I have to answer for any document because -- 
honestly -- that document has nothing to do with anything I have 
proposed. Inasmuch as it has nothing to do with anything I have 
proposed, it is as if did not exist. I think there are many 
other things to talk about; for example, how people speak of an 
invitation that has never been made. 
  [Reporter] Has [words indistinct] been invited? 
  [Robaina] No, we have not invited Gutierrez (Menoya) or any 
other person in particular. We are preparing the agenda today. 
Once the agenda has been prepared, we must evaluate a list of 
participants that will be in line with many (?concepts). If 
anyone wants to impose such conditions on an agenda of a meeting 
to which he has not been invited....[pauses] When one gets 
(?married), plans a party, or gives a speech, one establishes an 
agenda. Anyone who is interested in something other than what 
is on that agenda is evidently at the wrong party or meeting. 
At this time there is no possibility that we will talk about 
any person in particular. 
  I repeat: We are preparing an agenda in which we have many 
contacts with representatives of this Cuban community, and we 
know what things mutually concern us. I think that requires 
many things. If we want a dialogue and we have a meeting or 
conference of [words indistinct] so we will have something more 
than just a meeting, we must create an atmosphere that will 
allow us to identify, among Cubans, the main issues that concern 
us. Anyone from abroad who wants to pressure us is obviously 
wrong. 
  [Reporter] Do you think the internal dissidents will be able 
to participate in this meeting? 
  [Robaina] I think those who claim to be internal dissidents 
do not have immigration problems. In this meeting, we are going 
to discuss the problems with the Cubans who are abroad. They 
very much like being abroad, and that involves something else. 
With that community we are going to discuss other groups of 
issues that have to do with immigration and other topics related 
to that community, not only the portion of it that is in the 
United States. There is a very large community in Mexico, 
Venezuela, the Caribbean, [words indistinct]. There are 65 
Cubans in Jordan. 
  Can you imagine that? I believe the community in the United 
States is important, but the people who are in the Caribbean and 
Africa are most important. Most of them married students who 
were training in Cuba and now live abroad, but they want to 
maintain links with the country. We are referring to the normal 
communications of a country with its community abroad. We want 
to do this as much as possible, and that does not mean only 
those in the United States. 
  If you asked me, I will tell you I have just ordered very 
serious and complex discussions with representatives of that 
Cuban community in (?Mexico) and other countries in the 
Caribbean. They are highly insulted because they say we give 
all the exceptions and possibilities to those who are in the 
United States and not to those in other countries. So you can 
very well imagine that working with the Cuban community abroad 
is most complex. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Ilea Sardinas; recorded passages enclosed in </F>
quotation marks] 
  [Text] During a meeting with the members of the France-Cuba 
Solidarity Airlift, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], expressed Cuba's 
appreciation for their important donation to the country. 
Alarcon said this donation expresses the French people's 
constant friendship and solidarity for the Cuban people. 
[Alarcon] "In this solidarity we see an expression of the 
friendship and support we are receiving from the French people 
and workers. You have come to a country that is currently 
facing very complex and difficult times. I hope you have had an 
opportunity to see, first hand, something of what we are 
experiencing." 
  The ANPP president also talked about the efforts made by the 
Cuban people during 1993, the most difficult year since the 
triumph of the Revolution, and the steps being taken to overcome 
the crisis. 
  [Alarcon] "We are currently studying measures to be adopted 
to improve our internal finances. These measures will also help 
us confront a changing international situation, one that is 
quite different from the situation that prevailed throughout the 
past 30 years." 
  Alarcon also said that we are facing a situation similar to 
the one confronted by practically all the countries of the Third 
World and that a solution, based on our possibilities and goals, 
must be sought. 
  [Alarcon] "This is why we have said that we are attempting 
to 
find solutions through socialism, and for socialism." [end 
recording] 
  Alarcon met with the France - Cuba Solidarity Airlift at the 
Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples.

  [Text] Journalist Carlos Sanabria Marrero has informed the 
National Radio Newscast that Esteban Lazo Hernandez, first 
secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Santiago de Cuba, 
has held a news conference during which he talked about the main 
work objectives for 1994 in Santiago de Cuba Province. 
  [Begin Lazo recording] We are going to begin work at the 
refinery, which will take some time. It is going to be working 
in 1994. We are going to work out an agreement with the textile 
plant. We also are going to work hard at the El Cobre mine. 
There are sufficient resources in (Retome) to work this year, 
with the exception of (?trucks). Practically all the SIME 
[Ministry of the Steelworking Industry] enterprises are going to 
be able to work at full capacity on producing bicycles and other 
things. Practically all the Basic Industries plants are going to 
be working. Light Industry will have certain limitations. 
Practically all the Food Industry factories will be working. 
Thus, 1994 is a year for working. And I reiterate: It will be a 
hard year, a difficult year, but a year that, given the 
experiences of 1993, can be better, if we all work, if we all 
struggle. [end recording]

  [Text] The Antonio Maceo Thermoelectric Plant in Santiago 
de Cuba yesterday produced 250 megawatts per hour. This 
represents the highest production figure in the past few years. 
This record production is proof that the Santiago de Cuba 
thermoelectric plant can produce more than it has in the past. 
In 1993 there were times when the plant only produced 30 
megawatts per hour. The success of the plant is due to the 
workers efforts and maintenance work on several of the units. 
The quality and speed of the work earned the workers the 
outstanding workers banner. The Antonio Maceo Thermoelectric 
Plant has six electricity-producing units. At this time, 
maintenance work is being done on Unit No. 4. According to the 
schedule, this maintenance will be completed in May 1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Diosdado Maso] </F>
  [Text] I have just returned from San Rafael Boulevard in 
Havana. I went there because a comrade who was in Angola with 
me told me that the boulevard in Havana was worse than the 
Angolan alleyways (candongas). I felt insulted. I had an 
exchange of words with him, harsh words, but I do have to admit 
that he was right. 
  At the boulevard in Havana, I found a mixture of the legal 
and the irritably illegal. On the boulevard there are dozens of 
persons who have been authorized and have permits, as 
established in Decree No. 141 that allows self-employment, to 
sell the products they make with their own two hands. But the 
people who visit the boulevard are attacked, to use a word, by a 
dirty band of peddlers, unscrupulous people who have nothing to 
do with the measure adopted by the Revolution. What is worse, 
they seem to be acting without a worry of punishment in their 
minds and filling their pockets with illegally earned money. No 
one seems to want to stop these people. 
  Decree No. 141 that allows self-employment was discussed at 
length during the last session of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government. The discussions made it clear that this 
measure adopted by the Revolution needs to be controlled and 
supervised. The absence of control and supervision lets 
unscrupulous people, enemies of honest work, to mix with those 
authorized by Decree No. 141 to peddle their goods. The San 
Rafael Boulevard in Havana is possibly the worst example for the 
country. 
  I will repeat that there are dozens of people on the 
boulevard who have permits to sell the products they make. But 
for every one of these people, there are five who, without 
permits, sell bread and cheese or ham, hot pizza, and candy, 
which is not homemade and which they sell for 20 pesos. This 
kind of candy is sold at stores and their brand, shape, and size 
of the candy makes us believe that they were all taken out of 
the same container or box. They, of course, are selling this at 
an astronomical price. If you want to buy a pair of pants you 
are charged 1,500 pesos. A chocolate bar costs you 20 pesos, 
and so forth. 
  There is something else, something that make a real 
revolutionary stop and think. These people are old enough to 
work or young enough to be in school. I can truly tell you that 
my visit to the San Rafael Boulevard was an eye opener. There 
are some there who are authorized to sell on the boulevard, but 
who are also violating the law. Why? Well, their permit says 
that they are authorized to sell ceramics, but they are also 
selling plastic, aluminum and other products. It is not 
possible for one person to make all those articles. They have 
their stands there and nothing happens. 
  Now, regarding food, except for the peanut candy and the 
paper cones filled with 10 peanuts being sold at two pesos, the 
rest of the so-called fast foods established in Decree 141 are 
not being respected. Furthermore, if you are to look over 
Havana, you will see that many people are violating Decree 141. 
If you visit the diplomatic store in Miramar, you will see that 
right outside the fence the people are selling the products they 
bought earlier inside. The taxis are charging whatever they 
want and are also accepting dollars. We have been told in the 
past that we should not compare between what is happening in 
Havana and other areas of the country; however, I believe that 
it would be worthwhile to see if the decree is being respected 
in other provinces. Holguin comes to mind. I believe this 
would be the best comparison. 
  During the last ANPP session, it was agreed to appoint a 
group of inspectors to ensure that Decree 141 was being 
respected. I believe this will have to be done as soon as 
possible. It is very important that this be done. The people 
agree with self-employment but they are upset when we do not do 
something to perfect the law. For example, the people cannot 
understand how come a policeman enforces the law sometimes, and 
overlooks problems at other times. While on the boulevard I 
talked to a policeman. He told me that he felt that what was 
happening at the boulevard was wrong but that he worked for 
Havana Vieja Municipality and that in his municipality the 
people could not do what was being done on San Rafael Boulevard. 
When I asked him who was responsible, he told me that Zapata 
and Dragones Unit was responsible. But I found no policeman 
from the Zapata and Dragones Unit there. 
  I also believe the people's councils could do something 
about 
this. I repeat, the people approve of the self-employment 
measure because it contributes to solving some of our current 
problems; however, they want it to be a good measure. Our own 
Commander in Chief Fidel Castro said it at the ANPP session. It 
is a good and useful measure. Self-employment solves a problem 
today and will continue to solve problems in the future. I do 
believe it is worthwhile that every municipality or 
administrative council, in this case, the Havana Municipality, 
act immediately to solve this problem.

  [Text] Mexico City, 6 Jan (AFP) -- Five leaders of the 
Independent Workers and Peasants Central were arrested by the 
Army while en route to a meeting with Social Development 
Secretary Carlos Rojas, it was reported to the media by that 
organization. 
  The event occurred on Wednesday morning when the peasant 
leaders were taken away in a military Jeep in Chiapas State, 
where a guerrilla uprising against the government has been under 
way for six days. 
  Jorge Luna, Central's spokesman, deplored the fact that the 
minister failed to establish guarantees for the dialogue he 
summoned, adding that the "government has lost control over the 
Army," which is "deciding what should be done in the area 
involved in the conflict." 
  Luna issued an appeal to prevent a massacre of peasants and 
Indians and held the government responsible for the "tragedy 
that afflicts our state and our comrades' safety. 
  Moreover, 11 organizations that make up the Permanent 
Agrarian Congress condemned the arrests and sent a document to 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas demanding a political rather 
than a military solution to the conflict and urging the rebels 
to put down their weapons. 
  According to the Congress, the ownership of land in Chiapas 
represents an essential factor for peace and social justice.

  [Text] Mexico City, 6 Jan (AFP) -- The Zapatista National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) has accused the Mexican Army of taking 
prisoners, torturing them, then executing them with a shot to 
the head, according to a communique sent to the daily LA JORNADA 
and published today. 
  The communique, signed by the Mexico City Urban Front of the 
EZLN, stated that "we are struggling against the violence of 
poverty and hunger, against the violence of the electoral farce 
and unemployment, and against the disease of the poor. We are 
fighting for socialism." 
  The communique added that "we are considered outlaws because 
we are doing this," but one "cannot consider it legal when our 
demands for a better future are massacred with bombs. We also 
have a right to speak, but unfortunately the government only 
understands the language of weapons." 
  After making its accusations against the Army, the EZLN 
urged 
the Mexican soldiers not to kill innocent people. "If you have 
any courage, you must admit that you can no longer tolerate the 
look of hunger on the faces of our children. If you commit 
murder, we will be implacable. Refuse to kill honest Mexicans," 
the communique stated. 
  The rebels said they will not carry out any attacks in 
Mexico 
City, then asked: "Have you not yet seen that economic 
liberalism has failed? Do you not yet understand that other 
brotherly peoples of the hemisphere will follow us?" 
  The EZLN also sent a public message to Guatemalan Indian 
leader Rigoberta Menchu, winner of the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, 
indicating that it is aware of the problems afflicting the 
Guatemalan refugees in Mexico and that "perhaps now the Mexican 
state will no longer be interested in keeping up the facade of 
protecting refugees in its efforts to implement its repressive 
policy in the fields of Chiapas and throughout Mexico." 
  The communique added: "Do not be surprised if the government 
withdraws its support from the refugees, begins to repress them, 
and accuses them of participating in our struggle. That 
irresponsible rumor is already circulating among the 
authorities, who are always ready to seek obscure and disguised 
enemies where there is only one answer to hunger and oppression." 
  The Mexican Government had circulated the rumor that there 
were Central Americans among the rebels. On Wednesday the 
National Defense Secretariat announced that one Guatemalan had 
been arrested, and Deputy Government Secretary Socorro Diaz read 
a communique stating that the guerrillas are directed by 
"foreign and national" experts. 
  The EZLN reiterated that it bases its uprising on the 
Constitution and advised Rigoberta Menchu "to consider our 
struggle as nothing but a desire to rid ourselves of 500 years 
of poverty and oppression."

<F P=106> [Report by special AFP envoy Cristobal Kohn] </F>
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 6 Jan (AFP) -- 
The Mexican Federal Army continued on Thursday its cleanup 
operations in Chiapas State (southern Mexico) in pursuit of the 
guerrilla forces which have apparently dispersed in the 
mountains. 
  Military sources indicated there were skirmishes in the 
hills 
which surround San Cristobal de las Casas, during the sixth day 
of the insurrection launched by the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army (EZLN), but all cities seized by the rebels are 
now under the control of regular forces. 
  The Mexican Army, which has maintained an almost complete 
silence on the operations' development, has established 
roadblocks. On Thursday morning journalists were forbidden from 
travelling along the road to Ocosingo, north of San Cristobal, 
where violent clashes have occurred. 
  The media was able to ascertain that airplanes and 
helicopters continue to fly over the zone and have bombarded the 
vicinity of San Cristobal at least once on Thursday morning. 
  New military reinforcements, particularly light tanks, 
arrived on Thursday in San Cristobal (80,000 inhabitants), the 
second largest city in Chiapas State which was seized by the 
EZLN for more than 24 hours. 
  According to a communique from the municipality, the city 
has 
returned to normalcy and fuel and food supplies have been 
restored. 
  Local radio stations continue to broadcast messages from 
people who seek news about their relatives or who on the other 
hand only have this means of notifying their relatives that they 
are all right. 
  Some people, particularly in the Indian communities, are 
afraid the Army will conduct exactions [exacciones]. 
  "The Indians are afraid the military will not be able to 
tell 
the difference between them and the guerrillas," said Father 
Jesus Villalobos, who harbored 10 Indians from the Tzeltal 
ethnic group in his convent. 
  Carmela Hernandez, one of the refugees, explained the Army 
bombarded her village, San Antonio, on Tuesday, when the 
guerrilla forces had already withdrawn. 
  "A bomb fell 70 meters from my house, and I fled with my six 
children," she said. 
  Her husband remained in the village so no one would steal 
their animals. 
  Jorge Madrazo, chairman of the National Human Rights 
Commission (CNDH), arrived at San Cristobal on Wednesday and 
said the CNDH would increase its presence and investigate all 
reports "regardless of origin." 
  "Summary executions, disappearances, illegal arrests, and 
any 
other human rights violation are unacceptable," Madrazo added in 
a news conference.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 6 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Today 
in Chiapas State, the Mexican Army continued to pursue the armed 
groups which, during their retreat, launched a propaganda 
campaign. Meanwhile, the government provided food and supplies 
to the adversely affected population. The people who have been 
adversely affected by the violence in central-northern Chiapas 
over the past six days have begun to receive food, clothing, and 
water in the wake of the destruction of the infrastructure in 
the area, official sources said. 
  The government had announced that starting Thursday it would 
begin distributing those goods that are in low supply in the 
stores in the area of Los Altos de Chiapas -- the area from 
which the rebels emerged last Saturday. Just as in other towns, 
residents of San Cristobal de las Casas, located some 800 km 
southeast of Mexico City, are carrying out their daily chores 
under the protection of a large military contingent, according 
to eyewitnesses. 
  The Army is pursuing the armed groups, which began 
retreating 
to the mountains following the operations carried out by 
military forces, which have received air support in the place 
known as El Corralito, more than 4 km south of San Cristobal. 
The operations are limited to the mountainous region of Los 
Altos, where the takeover of towns and clashes with the Army 
have officially led to 100 deaths, 34 arrests, and an 
undetermined number of people wounded. 
  The armed groups of the so-called EZLN [Zapatista National 
Liberation Army] today launched a propaganda campaign with 
fliers handed out to the press, in which they claim a "right to 
speak," although they have rejected the government's proposal 
for a dialogue. The government requested on Wednesday an end to 
the attacks, the surrender of weapons, a return of hostages and 
those kidnapped, and the identification of the leaders of the 
armed groups as prerequisites for establishing a dialogue. 
  In their campaign, the armed groups assert that they are 
fighting to end the "violence of poverty," as well as in support 
of the lower classes and socialism, even though their leaders 
asserted in the beginning that "we are not communists or 
socialists." 
  The government reported on Wednesday that one of the 34 
rebels captured was the Guatemalan national Jesus Sanchez 
Galicia, who admitted he participated with the armed groups and 
that he received military training in Guatemala. The Mexican 
authorities are ruling out the possibility of the "organized" 
participation of the guerrilla Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity, although they consider it possible that there has been 
personal participation of foreigners, especially from Guatemala 
and El Salvador.

  [Excerpt] Mexico City, 6 Jan (EFE) -- The Zapatista 
National Liberation Army (EZLN) today seized Tenejapa, 
approximately 40 km from the city of San Cristobal de las Casas. 
Meanwhile, fighting continues in the nearby towns of El 
Corralito, San Isidro, El Ocotal, San Antonio de las Bajos, 
Corazon de Maria, and Ocosingo. 
  Early this morning, the Armed Forces bombed towns near San 
Cristobal de las Casas, forcing many people who live in the 
mountains to flee to the archeological area of Palenque or take 
refuge in the city. 
  The rebels today sent a letter to Rigoberta Menchu, winner 
of 
the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, warning her that the Mexican 
Government might accuse the Guatemalan refugees living in 
southeastern Mexico of being members of the rebel groups. The 
rebels indicated in the document that the government accepted 
the refugees 10 years ago "to give the world an image of 
humanitarianism and political opening." 
  Nevertheless, they added, that image "is not carried over in 
its relations with our own poor and exploited people, who suffer 
the same policies of genocide and ostracism that are practiced 
against Indian peoples in several Latin American nations." 
  From the beginning of the conflict, Menchu expressed her 
concern about the possible repression of the rebels and the 
conflict's repercussions on the Indian and popular organizations 
of Chiapas. She was especially concerned that the return of the 
Guatemalan refugees, which was scheduled to begin now, might be 
hindered. 
  In this regard, the rebels indicated in the letter that "no 
one knows better than us about their poverty and their desire 
for a decent life, which is denied in their own country, and we 
will not be the ones to prevent or use force against our 
brothers' return to their places of origin." 
  Meanwhile, the Mexican Army today increased its military 
movement in the mountainous areas of Chiapas and is preparing 
for new clashes with the rebels, who refuse to lay down their 
weapons and are recruiting more peasants to their ranks. 
  The conflict zone has been under siege by thousands of 
soldiers who are guarding all roads, with dozens of tanks, 
helicopters, and airplanes that are overflying the area to 
prevent a new offensive by rebel forces. 
  So far, the armed conflict in Chiapas has left, according to 
military figures, 96 dead. Unofficially, the number of deaths 
is estimated at 250, including soldiers, rebels, and civilians, 
and the number of wounded is estimated at 1,000. 
  With the intensification of the military offensive, hundreds 
of Indians and peasants are becoming the victim of thefts, and 
many have abandoned their homes and are fleeing to nearby towns 
in search of refuge. The Mexican Catholic Church has expressed 
its concern over the human rights violations that have been 
committed in the strife-torn area and has urged the government 
not to put down the violence with more violence. 
  Jorge Madrazo, chairman of the National Human Rights 
Commission, traveled to Chiapas to investigate charges about 
violations of the civilian population's constitutional rights, 
as well as excesses and arbitrary actions by the Army in its 
attempts to capture the rebels. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Mexican Army today [6 January] launched a 
new air assault on some sites in the town of Corralito, where it 
has been reported that rebels have taken refuge. Shooting 
continues between Mexican Army troops and snipers of the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army in Ocosingo. At the same 
time, a large number of troops was deployed in the area of 
Guadalupe Tepeyac, where heavy clashes are reported. 
  Today, the Army established a security cordon around combat 
zones, preventing both civilians and journalists from entering 
in an effort to prevent any incidents. This comes precisely 
because of what occurred yesterday when the Army staged a number 
of operations and bombings in an area where there were 
journalists. It is said the journalists were told that they 
were in the area at their own risk, but they nevertheless 
remained there. This was explained yesterday by Ramon Mota 
Sanchez, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee. 
As a result, it has been decided that journalists will not be 
permitted to enter combat zones to prevent similar incidents 
from occurring. 
  Meanwhile, there is tense calm in Altamirano and other towns 
affected by the violence. Commercial activities are taking 
place irregularly and classes are still suspended. [passage 
omitted] 
  The latest official figures on the number of victims in the 
confrontations show that 102 people have been killed, an 
undetermined number have been wounded, and 34 rebels have been 
arrested. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mexico City, 6 Jan (AFP) -- A government program 
that includes land distribution, equality toward women, urban 
[urbana] reforms, and workers improvements was made public today 
by the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) in the first 
edition of this group's publication "EL DESPERTADOR MEXICANO" 
which was forwarded to AFP offices in Mexico City. 
  In a 20-page item entitled "Living for the Country or Dying 
for Freedom," the guerrillas, who have been clashing with the 
Army in the southern State of Chiapas for the past six days, 
announced that "we have started the armed struggle" in order to 
accomplish "jobs, land, housing, food, health, education, 
independence, liberty, democracy, justice, and peace." 
  The bulletin also repeats the demands they announced on 1 
January when they launched their military activities, and 
guidelines are relayed "to EZLN leaders and officers." These 
guidelines include a "war tax bill" which will be levied "on all 
business establishments and property owners" in the regions 
where they operate. 
  The publication describes the regulations that will be 
implemented in the communities they "liberate" and includes the 
democratic election of authorities, prices and salary control, 
release of all prisoners -- excluding those charged with murder, 
rape, and drug trafficking -- the protection of abandoned 
children and senior citizens, and foreign companies will now 
have to pay their workers the same salary paid in their 
respective countries of origin. 
  The two-colored publication displays excellent type quality 
and carries at its top a photograph of Emiliano Zapata, the 
revolutionary leader who was one of the leaders who unleashed 
the 1910 Mexican Revolution. The publication also exhibits the 
photographs of some Zapatist members during training sessions in 
jungle regions. 
  "The people struggling against the oppressor government and 
the great national and foreign exploiters" will be entitled to 
bear arms for their defense and by obligation "respond to the 
call for help made by those authorities democratically elected," 
the EZLN announces in its publication. The Zapatists also 
propose that all public officials will be subject to audits 
aimed at detecting embezzlements, peasants' debts will not be 
recognized, and private property hoarding and production means 
[as received] will not be allowed. 
  The publication establishes the EZLN general headquarters in 
the Lacandona jungle region where clashes are currently taking 
place. Lacandona is located in the southern State of Chiapas 
bordering Guatemala.

<F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero from Medellin de Bravo, </F>
Veracruz; from the "Vector 21" newscast] 
  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today called for 
a crusade in favor of justice, peace, and harmony in rural areas 
because this is what Mexico wants. He confirmed that he will 
pay more personal attention to peasants in our country, and he 
demanded that government officials get out of their offices and 
into rural areas, thus joining efforts to solve the problems of 
the agricultural sector. 
  The president was in Veracruz for the 79th anniversary of 
the 
promulgation of the first agrarian law of Mexico. Here in 
Medellin de Bravo, he awarded 30 land titles to peasants. A 
total of 6,500 titles will be awarded in the area and nearly 
200,000 throughout the entire country. According to the 
president, these documents declare the land belongs to the 
peasants according to law. He pointed out that the law provides 
tranquillity. Let us listen to part of his speech, delivered by 
the president of the republic at the municipal sports field in 
Medellin de Bravo, Veracruz. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] In this manner, we can promote 
more 
progress in Mexican fields. Let us work so there will be 
greater well-being for Mexican peasants. In the presence of the 
peasants of Veracruz and all the peasants of my fatherland, I 
ratify today, 6 January, that I will continue being very close 
to the Mexican peasants. I will continue to work for the 
peasants of my fatherland. [applause] If I am willing to do 
this, then government officials will have to get out of their 
offices and out into the fields, get their boots dirty, and join 
efforts very close to the Mexican peasants. [end recording] 
  Six days after President Venustiano Carranza promulgated the 
1915 Agrarian Law -- the first one in Mexico -- the first 
agrarian committee was created in Medellin de Bravo Municipality 
in Veracruz State. Today, the leaders of the Permanent Agrarian 
Congress accompanied the president on the podium prepared for 
this ceremony. According to President Salinas, this Permanent 
Agrarian Congress is a pluralist organization that has met 
common goals, thus demonstrating how plurality can lead to 
achieving the superior goal of overall national improvement. 
  Host Governor Patricio Chirinos Calero emphasized that the 
people of Veracruz know very well that their greatest asset is 
the peace, tranquillity, and stability they enjoy based on more 
and better opportunities for social justice. That is why he 
seeks to make the fields a true source of justice and well-being 
for peasant families. 
  This is President Carlos Salinas de Gortari first domestic 
tour in 1994. It was conducted amid increased security. There 
are numbered [word indistinct] for the press, while a large 
group of military troops are ensuring order in the ceremonies 
being presided over today by the president. 
  At this time, the president is in Jalapa Municipality, 
capital of Veracruz State, where he is awarding land titles. He 
will personally deliver 21 titles, while 20,928 are 
simultaneously delivered in Jalapa. 
  To conclude his visit, the president will preside over a 
municipal improvement meeting at the government palace in 
Jalapa. He will return to Mexico City in the afternoon.

<F P=106> [Statement by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari </F>
concerning events in Chiapas State, made in Veracruz on 6 
January; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] The violence that has affected a region of the state 
of Chiapas is being generated by a group divided into two 
factions, as has been stated before: on one hand, a violent and 
armed group which is trying to disrupt peace within the 
communities, public peace, and harm government institutions; on 
the other hand, there is a group of Indians, several of whom, 
according to what they have told the media, were forced to arm 
themselves against their will. This is why we have determined 
this is not an Indian uprising but, rather, a deliberate action 
by this violent faction that heads the rebellion. 
  There has never been a country in which such an action has 
led to social advancement for those who have less, nor has such 
an action ever brought about democratic progress. The events in 
Chiapas sadden all Mexicans, because even after recognizing 
inequalities, as we have done, for many years Mexicans have 
worked together for generations to open the way for respect, 
dialogue, and peace. 
  In addition, it is not fair to make attempts on anyone's 
life. They are all Mexicans; they deserve the greatest respect. 
At the same time, it is disturbing that, by taking advantage of 
this situation of violence in this region of Chiapas, some are 
trying to damage the name of Mexico, which has taken so much 
time and effort to build. Therefore, this is an action that 
goes against national interests. This armed group is against 
Mexico. Several Indian and rural communities have rejected 
these people. 
  The roads of participation are open to everyone. New avenues 
may be opened if we persevere in our way of doing things. No 
one wants a Mexico in which liberties are reduced in an effort 
to guarantee security. Standing before you, I want to point out 
the fact that violence does not generate more freedom or 
democracy but, rather, hatred and political narrow-mindedness. 
  The Army and the state's security forces are fulfilling 
their 
duties in accordance with the law. The government's actions 
have had two purposes: the first, to protect the lives of the 
civilian population; and the second, to reestablish normalcy in 
the region. The actions of the government of the Republic are 
within the framework of the Constitution. The law will be 
applied strictly. The authorities' firm action will not be 
exercised against the communities, which we respect and support, 
or against the many organizations that work in the area in a 
dedicated manner and with which we have held dialogues. 
  There is a clear commitment to respect for human rights. 
There is a national consensus in favor of peace. In light of 
the events that have taken place in Chiapas State, this Monday I 
asserted, before the Permanent Commission of the Congress of the 
Republic, that within no region of Mexico are differences so 
great that they preclude our capacity for dialogue, nor is there 
enough distance to undermine our fundamental unity. This will 
always be the way things are. 
  At the same time, I want to express my gratitude for the 
responsible support stated today by all the political forces of 
the country -- support against violence. By standing united, we 
Mexicans will continue to progress and will be able to make 
Mexico's democratic life stronger for the wellbeing of everone 
and, above all else, for the wellbeing of our children.

<F P=106> ["New Year's message" by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de </F>
Gortari in Mexico City; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] My fellow countrymen: A region of Chiapas State has 
been affected by violence. Backwardness and poverty have 
existed in that beloved part of the Republic for many decades. 
In the past five years, we have worked hard and have invested 
many resources to correct this situation. 
  This has been possible because of many different social 
organizations that have maintained a constant dialogue with the 
government, and this dialogue has been fruitful. Nevertheless, 
a different kind of organization has emerged in Chiapas State. 
National and foreign experts on violence, who have nothing to do 
with the efforts being made by the people of Chiapas, have 
inflicted a painful blow against a region of this state and 
against the heart of all Mexicans. 
  This is why it has been correctly said that we must 
establish 
a distinction between two situations that exist in Chiapas: The 
armed aggression from a violent group, and the situation derived 
from the poverty and shortcomings in that region. 
  There is no Indian uprising in Chiapas. There is an action 
by a violent armed group that is acting against the peaceful 
state of the communities, public peace, and government 
institutions -- that is, against all those things that the 
Mexicans have been working to build for generations, and, for 
this reason, those things we appreciate so much. 
  The violent ones are carrying out discredited actions. In 
countries where this type of violence has existed, the result 
has been destruction and backwardness. An action like this has 
never produced social progress for the poor or democratic 
progress in any country. The events in Chiapas sadden all 
Mexicans, because even after recognizing inequalities, for many 
years Mexicans have worked to open the way for respect, 
dialogue, and peace. 
  Attacks on Indians, on people from those cities, on 
policemen, on soldiers from the National Army are wrong. In 
addition, it is not fair to make attempts on anyone's life. 
They are all Mexicans; they deserve the greatest respect. At 
the same time, it is disturbing that, by taking advantage of 
this situation, some are trying to damage the name of Mexico, 
which has taken so much time and effort to build. 
  Attempts to undermine the country's prestige would not 
contribute to resolving social or economic problems and would 
not produce political progress. Therefore, this is an action 
that goes against national interests. This armed group is 
against Mexico. 
  The objectives of the armed group in Chiapas have not been 
secured. Several Indian and rural communities have rejected 
these people. Many Indian and peasant communities of Chiapas 
have demanded protection from the Mexican Army and have offered 
to participate in efforts to avoid the aggression. 
  We are making firm progress, although the situation is still 
delicate because the aggressors have continued attacking our 
soldiers. They can continue producing isolated actions of 
violence. No country can avoid this, but they will fail. 
  The resoluteness of the Mexicans united against violence 
will 
defeat them. They were offered a dialogue from the very 
beginning of the confrontation. They responded with more acts 
of violence. We again reiterate our offer for dialogue. 
  The roads of participation are open to everyone. New avenues 
may be opened if we persevere in our way of doing things, in our 
tradition of working in peace and united. No one wants a Mexico 
in which liberties are reduced in an effort to guarantee 
security. No one wants to suspend constitutional guarantees in 
that region of Chiapas. 
  Violence does not generate more freedom or democracy but, 
rather, hatred and political narrow-mindedness. 
  The Army and the state's security forces are fulfilling 
their 
duties in accordance with the law. 
  The government's actions have had two purposes: the first, 
to protect the lives of the civilian population; and the second, 
to reestablish normalcy in the region -- normalcy Chiapas 
residents are so fond of -- normalcy that will allow us to 
devote all of our efforts to promoting more justice. To achieve 
the first objective, we have protected the personal safety of 
citizens and the security of communities. To achieve this 
second objective, those criminals who have been arrested are 
being placed under the custody of the Attorney General's Office, 
which takes its authority from local authorities. 
  The most important priority has been to protect the civilian 
population and to restore the possibility of a peaceful solution 
to the conflict. To protect the civilian population of this 
area from the difficulties they are experiencing, we have 
launched programs to deliver food, blankets, and medicine, and 
other public health programs are under way to deal with 
emergencies, prevent diseases, and reestablish medical care in 
the hospitals damaged by the attackers. Army personnel are 
protecting and distributing much of these badly needed supplies 
in this area. 
  The actions of the government of the Republic are within the 
framework of the Constitution. The law will be applied 
strictly. The authorities' firm action will not be exercised 
against the communities, which we respect and support, or 
against the many organizations that work hard in the area in a 
dedicated manner and with which we have held dialogues. 
  For those facing conditions of poverty, and for those who 
have participated in these actions because of deceit, pressure, 
or even desperation -- for these people who end their violent 
and illegal actions, we will seek honorable treatment, and we 
will even consider granting a pardon. The government of the 
Republic has the unyielding determination to resolve this 
conflict and fully reestablish the state of law in this part of 
Chiapas with a clear and firm commitment, respecting human 
rights. 
  My fellow Mexicans: There is clear commitment to respect for 
human rights. There is a national consensus in favor of peace. 
In light of the events that have taken place in Chiapas State, 
this Monday I asserted, before the Permanent Commission of the 
Congress of the Republic, that within no region of Mexico are 
differences so great that they preclude our capacity for 
dialogue, nor is there enough distance to undermine our 
fundamental unity. This will always be the way things are. 
  At the same time, I want to express my gratitude for the 
responsible support stated today by all the political forces of 
the country -- support against violence. Once the fighting 
concludes in the area of conflict in the state of Chiapas, this 
region will continue to advance in its objectives of more 
justice for Indian communities and in favor of those who need 
more. By standing united, we Mexicans will continue to progress 
and will be able to make Mexico's democratic life stronger for 
the wellbeing of everyone and, above all else, for the 
well-being of our children. Thank you, very much.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Sarmenta from the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The conflict in Chiapas State in no way creates 
conditions to impede the elections process which will lead to 21 
August elections, according to Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential 
candidate for the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD], who 
has called for a suspension of hostilities in the southeastern 
state. Cardenas made his statement when visiting Ruben Lenero 
and Magdalena de las Salinas Hospitals during the celebration on 
Nurses Day. Cardenas also said that instead of being concerned 
about electoral strategies, we must seek a political solution to 
the conflict in Chiapas and prevent any further loss of human 
life. 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] Regardless of what your electoral 
preferences may be, regardless of your sympathies for the sides 
in the conflict, you are not the one directly involved in what 
is going on. We have to call on both sides to create the 
opportunity to suspend the hostilities. We need to seek 
political negotiations, because this is a political conflict, 
which emerges from the application of failed policies. We hope 
a solution may be found. [end recording] 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said whether or not the uprising in 
Chiapas is promoted by Indians, the lives of Mexican people are 
being lost, and this must be stopped. The PRD presidential 
candidate said the three Chiapas bishops have the best chance of 
being heard by those involved in the conflict. He said he hopes 
the participation of the bishops could stop the bloodshed. The 
PRD presidential candidate also said he will not change his 
campaign program, adding that within the next three months he 
will be going to Chiapas State.

<F P=106> [Report by Rosi Ahuaxin] </F>
  [Text] On 6 January, Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential 
candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], 
proposed for the consideration of presidential candidates of the 
various political parties the possibility of issuing a joint 
declaration on the recent developments in Chiapas. Colosio 
already sent the draft text based on agreements reflected in the 
statements of the various candidates in condemning violence in 
the State of Chiapas. 
  The text, if approved by all parties -- Cecilia Soto of the 
Labor Party, Marcela Lombardo of the Popular Socialist Party, 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party, 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of the Democratic Revolutionary 
Party, Jorge Gonzalez Torres of the Mexican Green Ecologist 
Party, Rafael Aguilar Talamantes of the Cardenist Front for 
National Reconstruction Party, and Pablo Emilio Madero of the 
Mexican Democratic Party -- the joint declaration would state: 
  No conflict, no difference, no aspiration should be reason 
to 
break social peace and jeopardize the life of Mexicans. The 
declaration adds that violence only generates rancor, division, 
and loss of human life; everyone loses with violence. 
  The joint declaration of the presidential candidates adds 
that social underdevelopment [rezagos] angers everyone; it is a 
national priority to overcome this. We can only achieve this, 
however, when there is stability and harmony in community life. 
We are a nation that loves liberty, that believes in dialogue 
and peaceful coexistence, and that rejects bloodshed as a means 
of settling differences. 
  The declaration also states that the repudiation of violence 
in Chiapas reaffirms the humanistic nature of our people. We 
urge, the declaration states, those who are operating outside 
the framework of the law to respect the legal state that we 
Mexicans established and thus achieve the lofty goals of the 
nation.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Casasola from the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpt] A few minutes ago, the Mexican Attorney General's 
Office announced it has filed criminal charges against eight of 
the nine lawbreakers who killed five Mexican soldiers and 
seriously injured four others in Rancho Nuevo, Chiapas State, on 
2 January. 
  Following the preliminary investigations, the Attorney 
General's Office said the eight people under arrest are 
allegedly responsible for the crimes of murder and association 
with criminal intent and are charged with the possession of 
firearms that are meant only for the exclusive use of the 
Mexican Army, Navy, and Air Force. 
  The eight individuals were turned over to the First Criminal 
Court judge in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas State. They are: Juan 
Jimenez Santis, Juan Carlos Ruiz Garcia, Juan Guzman Velasco, 
Miguel Giron Lopez, Javier Jimenez Fernandez, Miguel Giron 
Guzman, Palemon Cabrera Arizon, and Alonso Moreno Hernandez. We 
must point out that the Mexican Attorney General's Office said 
Alonso Moreno Hernandez will probably be charged with other 
crimes. 
  The ninth person is a minor, Jose Lopez Hernandez, who also 
participated in the attacks on the Army members. According to 
the Attorney General's Office, the necessary steps are being 
taken to turn him over to the juvenile court in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, Chiapas. 
  As for the events that took place on 2 January 1994, the 
Attorney General's Office said the nine members of the 
subversive group attacked a Mexican Army patrol near the village 
of Rancho Nuevo at approximately 0700 and immediately ambushed 
the Army members, killing 1st Cavalry Captain Vladimir Lara 
Salgado, Lieutenant Fernando Monroy Tinajero, 2d Infantry 
Sergeant Gilberto de Jesus Damaso, and Infantry Corporals 
Encarnacion Mejia Hernandez and Jordan Gonzalez Gonzalez. Those 
injured were 1st Infantry Capt. Jose Luis Garcia Magana, 1st 
Infantry Capt. Carlos Echeverria Mendez, Corporal Abimael de 
Jesus Morales, and Private Rodolfo Lopez Arriola. 
  The Mexican Attorney General's Office indicated that other 
Army members arrested the nine subversives when they repelled 
the attack. During the operation the Army confiscated three 
410-gauge shotguns, a 12-gauge shotgun, a rifle, a sawed-off 
shotgun, two AR-15 rifles, a grenade, and approximately 100 
cartridges of various calibers. 
  The Attorney General's Office concludes its report by saying 
that during the investigations carried out by the Federal 
Judicial Police, the necessary evidence was collected to show 
that these nine people did in fact participate in the ambush 
against members of the Mexican Army. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez has said he 
thinks the Guatemalan peace dialogue will not be altered by the 
situation in Mexico's state of Chiapas. 
  [Begin recording] [Enriquez] If reports originating in 
Mexico 
and others produced here in Guatemala confirm the participation 
of the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity], there 
will undoubtedly be some repercussions in the peace talks. 
  [Reporter] Do you know whether those who were arrested have 
links to the URNG [words indistinct]? 
  [Enriquez] We do not have any specific information yet. We 
know there were arrests; as you know, newspapers on the morning 
of 5 January reported that. We do not have any official 
reports. As soon as we have official information, including 
names, we will let you know. As of now, all I know is what I 
read in the newspapers. Perhaps on the afternoon of 6 January we 
will have more concrete and official reports. At that time it 
is possible that the Foreign Ministry will release information 
to you; if not, I will do so as soon as information is available 
to me. At this time, the information we have we learned from 
the newspapers. 
  [Reporter] News dispatches from Mexico say the Guatemalan 
Army has reinforced the border. Is this true? 
  [Enriquez] We have not bolstered security along the border. 
On the morning of 5 January I told you that the Guatemalan 
Army's largest military presence had already been the one along 
the Mexican border. We have not increased it. If security 
there is reinforced, it is because three subversive groups are 
still present there -- the ORPA [Revolutionary Organization of 
the People in Arms], the EGP [Poor People's Guerrilla Army], and 
the FAR [Rebel Armed Forces]. This is the border where we have 
stationed the most units. [end recording]

January. 
  The National Institute of Statistics and Census, INDEC, 
reported that the unemployment rate increased to 9.3 percent in 
October. Unemployment affects 1.078 million of the 11.6 million 
people in the economically active population, PEA. The 
underemployment rate was also 9.3 percent and affects 2.157 
million. The unemployment rate measured by the PEA increased

  [Text] Planalto Palace released a statement this afternoon 
on an interview given on 5 January by Justice Minister Mauricio 
Correa in Machete Television Network's Power Struggle program. 
  According to the newspapers, in the interview Justice 
Minister Correa reportedly said that between October and 
November of last year a group of civilians and soldiers 
reportedly urged President Itamar Franco to carry out a coup 
similar to the one carried out by Alberto Fujimori in Peru, and 
to impose strong measures against Congress and the Judicial 
Branch. 
  According to presidential adviser Fernando Costa, President 
Franco said: First, he did not attend the meeting. Second, the 
justice minister informed the president early this morning that 
he never talked about a coup during the interview. And last, the 
interview with the justice minister is the justice minister's 
responsibility. 
  Justice Minister Mauricio Correa said today that he did not 
talk about a coup during the interview with Manchete Television 
Network. 
  Correa explained that he talked about the government's 
projects, and reporter Carlos Chagas asked during the interview 
if there was an environment of tension in the country at any 
time that could obstruct the constitutional order. The minister 
said that between October and November of last year the country 
was experiencing a period of extreme concern due to low 
salaries, a high inflation rate, and the impasse in the Federal 
Supreme Court over the decision on former President Fernando 
Collor's political future. In addition to that, said the 
minister, the people saw images of the corruption in the country 
everyday. 
  Mauricio Correa said that as justice minister he gave an 
interpretation in the interview of what he felt, but that at no 
time did he say President Itamar Franco was under pressure: 
  [Begin recording] In case you saw the interview, I never 
talked about a coup that was being hatched inside the 
government. I only gave an interpretation of what I felt as 
minister; that was my duty. [end recording] 
  Minister Correa also said that if he is summoned, he will go 
to Congress to repeat what he said in the Manchete Television 
Network interview. Correa added that the country is going 
through a time when things should not be hidden, that this can 
even serve as therapy for the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Paola Badaracco] </F>
  [Text] President Ramon Jose Velasquez granted a news 
conference yesterday and said the 1994 budget should consider 
the urgent needs of the security corps. "It is necessary to 
increase the number of security corps and to supply them with 
resources that this critical situation demands. I am talking 
about transportation units and all other requirements of the 
service." 
  He explained that measures are being taken to control the 
possession of weapons. He noted that both legal and illegal 
weapons sales have increased at an alarming rate recently and 
said that the weapons go to the most densely populated, poorest 
areas; that is, to the neighborhoods. 
  He described weapon control measures and noted that they 
must 
be part of an ongoing program, just like everything else 
involved in security. 
  The president reported that the National Security and 
Defense 
Council will be installed this afternoon and that the Rural 
Security Council will meet tomorrow to discuss the border 
security problem. 
  Velasquez said the meetings will be attended by governors 
from the border states, livestock owners associations, and 
officials from the various ministries and offices related to the 
livestock sector. 
  The president stated: "Efforts to make life and work in that 
large area more secure are important and cannot be delayed." 
  Velasquez said Colombia takes very much the same view, and 
that is why the Colombian Government has expressed through its 
highest authorities its interest in reaching an agreement on the 
matter. 
  Velasquez appeared optimistic. He said that in the next few 
weeks Colombian authorities will make reinforcements on their 
side of the border a fact. 
  Regarding life in the poor sectors, the president said he 
will hold talks this week to establish the nature of the social 
problem, which he is sure the next government will inherit. 
  He noted: "When one sees a bus loaded with 80 young people 
arriving at a court so they can stand trial, one must realize 
that the state did not do a thing to help them when they were 
children." 
  The president believes that the situation of poor children 
who live in heavily populated areas must be improved. 
  He added: A program in this regard must be initiated because 
repression is useless. He added: The social sector of my 
government wants to set the basis for actions to modify public 
education. 
  As an example the president mentioned private organizations, 
including religious ones, that do educational work in these 
zones and achieve very positive results. Their work is somewhat 
different from that of public education. 
  The president said he wants to propose this reform. He noted 
that in Merida State an extraordinary project called integral 
education has been implemented. The project was set in motion 
by Antonio Luis Cardenas, former rector of the Libertador 
Pedagogic School. 
  He said that this program takes into consideration economic 
limitations and the need to guide the young toward learning some 
trade capable of furnishing them with a practical tool with 
which to face life. 
  According to the president, the fundamental idea is to start 
this program with children and to have morning and afternoon 
classes so they have food assistance throughout the day. 
  Regarding pardons, President Velasquez said he is studying 
a new list and will release the names this week. He again asked 
those who are still outside the law to return to justice. 
  In addition, Velasquez said he is working on Colonel Iginio 
Castro's return from Quito. Castro is seriously ill. The 
defense minister wants to transfer Castro to the Caracas 
Military Hospital and take other steps later. 
  The president recalled that in his salute to the Armed 
Forces 
and in several statements, he has always asked the leaders and 
other persons involved in the coup attempts to legalize their 
status. 
  Velasquez said: I did so in Los Proceres Avenue during the 
ceremony to salute the National Armed Forces. I asked the 
officers who are in Lima to return and to do so with the 
assurance that there is a complete legal state. 
  Velasquez believes that the time is right because the 
grounds 
for an agreement have been set with the elected government. 
  He said: Of course it is the right time, under the country's 
current state of law and with the guarantees granted by the 
Constitution. 
  Regarding the situation of some officials under arrest due 
to 
the notorious El Amparo case [border massacre], he admitted that 
pardons are being reviewed and that 12 persons are involved. 
  In his statements, Ramon J. Velasquez referred to relations 
between his government and President-elect Caldera, describing 
them as cordial as there has been a flow of information on all 
public administration aspects through Julio Sosa Rodriguez, the 
liaison. 
  "He, in turn, has a group of individuals who help coordinate 
the transfer of power. For example, there is Nepomuceno Garrido 
in the Labor Ministry, Maria de Guzmas in Family, Elba Ruiz in 
Education, Jose Ignacio Moreno Leon in Privatization, Roberto 
Centeno in Transportation, and Gustavo Rodriguez Amengual in 
Environment, to name a few. In the office of the Secretariat of 
the Presidency Ministry, we have Andres Caldera, Fernando Egana, 
and Fernando Febres Cordero," Velasquez said. 
  Asked about his meeting with President Caldera, Velasquez 
replied that he went to speak about the IVA [value-added tax] 
and that the situation has been clarified. 
  Velasquez stressed that Sosa Rodriguez is satisfied because 
modifications made to the first report by Caldera's economic 
team were taken into account. 
  "Thus, as Sosa Rodriguez says, the text that was published 
fulfills the suggestions made. There is a 15-percent increase 
for luxury items and greater exemptions for basic food basket 
items, medical products -- pacemakers, prosthesis and other 
items, plus land, maritime, and air transportation," said 
Velasquez. 
  In his first meeting of 1994 with media representatives, 
Velasquez sent Venezuelans and all others living in the country 
his cordial greetings for the New Year, his good wishes, and his 
wish that the country consolidate its march, mainly for social 
and political peace, for economic development, for cultural and 
scientific advancement, and for the affirmation of traditional 
positive Venezuelan values.

  [Text] Because of international legal concerns, the 
government of the Republic, through the Ministries of Foreign 
Relations and Government, may create in our country refugee 
camps for Mexican refugees. These refugees would remain in the 
camps while the presidents of Mexico and Guatemala determine the 
best path to follow, according to Defense Minister Mario Rene 
Enriquez Morales. 
  The minister recalled that for 12 years, Mexico has given 
shelter to many Guatemalan refugees. He also noted that some of 
these are "guerrillas" who have crossed into Mexican territory 
and have been received as refugees. As evidence of this, he 
continued, URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] rebels 
are living in Mexico and have established organs of influence, 
such as the news agencies CERIGUA and ENFOPRENSA. 
  Nevertheless, the military leader said: "I hope the 
situation the Mexican brothers are going through changes when 
the rebels understand the damage they are inflicting upon the 
population. In turn, they will have to take measures aimed at 
dialogue and reconciliation to spare residents more death and 
suffering." 
<H5>  Defense Minister Confirms URNG Support </H5>
  Defense Minister Enriquez Morales stated yesterday that 
reports about the military logistical participation of the URNG 
within the Zapatista National liberation Army (EZLN) have been 
confirmed, as stated by Mexican authorities. 
  Mexico's Attorney General's Office told the media covering 
the events that URNG combatants are participating in the attacks 
on the town of San Cristobal de las Casas, because one of them 
was captured. The defense minister said that this confirms our 
feeling. 
  There is no official information on URNG involvement; 
however, the possibility that the URNG may be furnishing weapons 
and supplies to destabilize Mexico, as they cannot do in their 
own country, has not been ruled out, Enriquez concluded.

  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 6 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- The 
Guatemalan Army today placed its troops along the Mexican border 
on alert after it confirmed the presence of insurgent Mexican 
columns within 800 meters of national territory. Army 
spokeswoman Major Edith Vargas told ACAN-EFE that the Military 
Command is coordinating surveillance along the border, which is 
divided into seven military zones, although it has not felt the 
need to send reinforcements. 
  On 1 January, the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) 
declared war on the Mexican Government in the southeastern state 
of Chiapas, where clashes have left more than 200 dead, 
according to various sources. Since yesterday, EZLN rebels have 
been present in the community of Guadalupe Tepeya, about 800 km 
from the Guatemalan border north of Huehuetenango Department. 
Security and defense in this area is under Military Zone No. 
19, but the border area is also being guarded by troops and 
detachments that are under commands [centrales] in the northern 
departments of Quiche and Alta Verapaz. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mexico City, 6 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- During a morning 
meeting today, which ended in a climate of confidence, the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) and the 
Guatemalan Government delegates agreed on an agenda for 
preliminary meetings, according to sources from both sides. 
  "There is a climate of trust," one guerrilla source 
indicated. He added that at the meeting held this morning, 
Thursday, the two sides agreed on the agenda for the talks to 
reach a peace agreement in Guatemala. The source, however, 
refrained from revealing the points in the agenda. 
  "We are advancing much more than we expected. The meeting 
has been very productive. The climate in cordial," a government 
source commented in regard to the preliminary meetings that are 
to last four days and which were called by the United Nations. 
The meetings, which are being held in a leading hotel in Mexico 
City, are attended by eight government members (three military 
officers, three civilians, and two advisers), three URNG Command 
representatives, two URNG Political-Diplomatic Commission 
delegates, and the UN-designated mediator Jean Arnault. 
  The preliminary meetings, which were called at the request 
of 
the rebels and President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's government, are 
part of an effort to continue talks that were interrupted in 
1993.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 6 Jan (DPA) -- 
The Mexican Armed Forces today attacked with mortars rebel 
positions in the mountains which surround the city of San 
Cristobal de las Casas, in southern Chiapas State. 
  The Mexican Army's attack was launched from the region of 
Maria Auxiliadora hill, approximately 8 km southeast of San 
Cristobal de las Casas, where clashes between the Armed Forces 
and rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) have 
concentrated. 
  The new military operation in the zone, which began shortly 
after 0700 local (1300 GMT), was confirmed by residents to 
Mexican and foreign journalists who traveled to the area despite 
the defense ministry's recommendations to the media yesterday -- 
to abstain from entering the combat zone, for security reasons. 
  Six Mexican journalists were almost killed yesterday when 
machinegun fire from Mexican Air Force aircraft hit near the 
station wagon in which they traveled toward Maria Auxiliadora 
hill. 
  There is still no information if the Army's bombardments and 
machinegun fire in the region have resulted in casualties. 
However, San Cristobal de las Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz said he 
had received information about the disappearance of various 
Indians who live in the zone. 
  Clashes in the mountain zone south of San Cristobal de las 
Casas began on Tuesday, when fighter airplanes launched the 
first attack on Maria Auxiliadora hill to evict groups of rebels 
that withdrew to the mountain after leaving various towns they 
seized on Saturday.

  [Text] San Jose, 7 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Today Costa Rican 
President Rafael Angel Calderon expressed his solidarity with 
the Mexican Government, and he called on the rebel groups 
operating in several towns in the Mexican state of Chiapas to 
stop the violence. 
  The president said in a telephone call, "I expressed our 
broad and brotherly solidarity to Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari, and today I want to take this opportunity to 
publicly reiterate it." 
  Calderon said that the violent actions in Chiapas are 
unjustified now that Salinas de Gortari "has made Mexico a 
nation of great economic and social development, the fruits of 
which are already being experienced by the people." Violence, 
he stressed, has never been a foundation for democratization 
processes or a permanent base for social achievements.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Barahona on the weekly news conference by </F>
Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani after a ceremony marking 
the deployment of National Civilian Police units at the 
Unicenter Commercial Center in Soyapango on 3 January; from the 
"El Salvador Telepress" newscast; passages within quotation 
marks recorded] 
  [Text] [Cristiani] "We have decided to discontinue 
demobilizing the National Police [PN] for as long as this change 
in the deployment plans for the National Civilian Police [PNC] 
requires. This will not modify the general timetable, however. 
The PNC transfer and deployment plans will be completed by 
October 1994. Our intention now is to transfer those units being 
discharged from the PN to other places requiring a greater 
security force presence." 
  This plan will have other consequences in San Salvador, such 
as the reorganization of the city's layout. President Cristiani 
said that this will be done gradually, as the PNC is deployed 
throughout the city. The president explained this as follows: 
  [Cristiani] "Instead of the nine or 11 sectors into which 
the city was divided before, we will now have 45 sectors in the 
metropolitan area. We have evaluated the city's physical 
structure--meaning streets, neighborhoods, municipal limits and 
other aspects of the terrain--and reached this distribution. 
Each sector will have a person who will be responsible for the 
sector's public security. He or she will be at least an officer 
or a deputy commissioner, which the PNC will explain later in 
greater detail, regarding Soyapango and Ilopango. Each sector 
will have at least 50 public security units. If we can do this, 
we will have more than the initial 2,000 units we had with both 
public force institutions." 
  This again leads to another important question: When will 
the PNC be completely deployed in San Salvador? The president 
apparently has a set timetable that he presented during the news 
conference. 
  [Unidentified reporter] "Mr. President, under this new 
direction of the public security plans, when will the PNC be 
deployed to all these areas you have described?" 
  [Cristiani] "The deployment plan is a gradual one. The next 
two municipalities are not yet defined. These next two will be 
determined in January, basically because there are several 
variables that must be considered. These elements include 
terrain extension, the number of criminal cases, the graduation 
rate at the public security school, the reenlistment of PN 
personnel, and so on. We have completed this study for 
Soyapango and Ilopango, and we are making further evaluations to 
determine which municipality will follow. We believe that the 
PNC will be deployed in the metropolitan area in approximately 
four or five months." 
  That is basically what President Cristiani said today about 
completing the PNC deployment in San Salvador. One might ask 
why Soyapango and Ilopango were selected for deployment. The 
government reports that 339 crimes are reported here in 
Soyapango. A majority of 57 cases are car thefts, while 53 
percent are muggings.

  [Text] San Salvador, 8 Jan (AFP) -- Salvadoran President 
Alfredo Cristiani said Saturday that his Mexican colleague, 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, is seeking a solution to the week-old 
Mexican armed conflict but "will not harm the population." 
During a news conference following a visit to Mexico, President 
Cristiani said: "Of course we discussed the Chiapas problems. 
President Salinas said it is a very delicate matter and that he 
is trying to solve it as quickly as possible without inflicting 
any suffering on the population." 
  Salinas met with Cristiani and Honduran President Rafael 
Callejas in Mexico City and told them about the ongoing events 
in southern Mexico that began with an uprising led by the 
Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN). Regarding reports by 
Mexican officials about the alleged presence of Salvadoran 
guerrillas fighting alongside the EZLN, Cristiani said the issue 
was not discussed during his meeting with Salinas. 
  Cristiani did say that the consequences of the North 
American 
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for Central America was among the 
main issues discussed during the meeting. The agreement signed 
by Mexico, the United States, and Canada went into effect on 1 
January. According to Cristiani, "Mexico is willing to continue 
negotiations for a free trade agreement with Central America. 
It would be a disadvantage for our products not to have access 
to the Mexican market."

  [Text] San Salvador, 7 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) reported here today the 
murder of three other members of that organization in the 
western Department of Santa Ana. 
  FMLN Spokesman Juan Ramon Medrano said that the victims were 
members of the same family and that the incident occurred on 29 
December in the town of Ochupse, in the jurisdiction of Santa 
Ana Volcano. 
  According to the FMLN version, several heavily armed men 
stormed the victims' house and killed Lorenzo de Jesus Cabrera, 
Santo Feliciana Venegas, and Ruben Eduardo Escobar--tattooing 
the letter M on his body after beheading him. 
  The victims were rank and file FMLN militants in Santa Ana 
Department, and the sources said this was another political 
crime. 
  "Nothing was stolen from the house; they came expressly to 
kill them," said Zeledon Rodriguez, FMLN representative in Santa 
Ana. 
  The former guerrillas demanded an investigation in Santa 
Ana, 
which was one of the regions that was viewed as a bastion for 
the death squads during the past armed conflict. 
  According to FMLN statistics, in 1993 approximately 40 
members of that organization, including rank and file militants 
and leaders, were killed by presumed death squads. 
  A special commission consisting of two delegates from the 
Salvadoran Government, one from the United Nations, and the 
ombudsman is investigating political murders that have occurred 
after the signing of peace agreements in January 1992. 
  [Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish at 0014 on 7 January 
transmits a report stating that "the FMLN reported on 7 January 
the murder of another member in the western Department of La 
Libertad." The report adds that "an FMLN spokesman identified 
the victim as Vicente Soto, a member of the Farabundo Marti 
People's Liberation Forces (FPL)."]

  [Text] Mexico City, 8 Jan (AFP) -- UN Under Secretary 
General Marrack Goulding was present today at meetings between 
the Guatemalan Government and guerrillas, which began three days 
ago in Mexico City. 
  Goulding continued the process that began Friday during 
which 
both delegations are meeting separately with UN officials, 
including mediator Jean Arnault. 
  The secrecy surrounding the topics discussed and whether a 
consensus has been reached was maintained again today. 
Guerrilla Commander Pablo Monsanto, however, said that "the 
meeting is taking place under positive terms" and thus did not 
rule out the possibility of reaching an agreement if the current 
pace continues. 
  Goulding's unexpected arrival has caused observers to 
believe 
that an agreement could be reached on Sunday, when the current 
round of talks is scheduled to end. 
  The topics discussed include human rights, the situation of 
Conciliator Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada, whose mediation the 
government no longer recognizes, and the participation of 
civilian society in the solution of the conflict. 
  Meanwhile, leaders of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity rejected accusations by the Army that the URNG is linked 
to the guerrilla uprising in the Mexico's Chiapas State.

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On Thursday night, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
commented on the first preliminary meeting between government 
and the URNG [National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity] 
representatives. On this topic, the president said he trusts 
these first rapprochements will yield good results in order to, 
later, insist on a peace agreement. 
  [Begin De Leon recording] We have learned that the first 
stage of the preliminary meeting, a discreet meeting, was held 
today, aimed only and exclusively at establishing the 
mechanisms, procedures, and frames of reference for establishing 
a formal dialogue. 
  This means that this preliminary meeting is not meant to 
analyze the plan. The plan is being carried out in its first two 
stages: The national reconciliation here in Guatemala and the 
struggle against poverty, which is the second stage, or a 
response to the economic and social needs, which is also being 
developed. 
  The third stage, however -- the dialogue between the 
government and the URNG to end the internal armed conflict, 
which is more than 30 years old -- is the one that today, in the 
first session or meeting, was started through a preliminary 
meeting. 
  I know today's meeting agenda was thoroughly discussed; that 
is why we said the meeting was not successful, but just normal, 
I would say. The URNG representatives and the representatives 
of the government I head talked about and completed the agenda 
for today; tomorrow, the meeting continues, and, I can say, with 
great hope and faith that the political will of the parties will 
be presented and demonstrated at this first meeting and, of 
course, in the others too. This could lead us, in the short 
term, to the possibility of reaching peace, to later dedicate 
ourselves to peace, and not just to end the internal armed 
confrontation; this is not just peace as an absence of bullets, 
but also to build peace here -- economic, social, and overall 
peace with social justice for all Guatemalans. [end recording] 
  The president added that the armed rebellion in Chiapas 
State, Mexico, will not have a negative influence on the peace 
talks with the Guatemalan guerrillas. 
  [Begin recording] [De Leon, in progress] ... favorable in a 
way, because I believe that this, pressures -- to use an 
adequate and simple term -- the URNG to speed up the peace 
process, mainly taking into account the fact that one Guatemalan 
has already been captured after participating in those 
subversive activities, those illegal actions, outside the law of 
Mexico; and therefore, I think this in no way hurts the peace 
talks. On the contrary, I think it speeds up the process. It is 
another external aspect that contributes to the fulfillment of 
that political will by the URNG. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, the Mexican Army, 
however, has repeatedly accused Guatemalan refugees in Mexico of 
starting that rebellion. What is your opinion on this? 
  [De Leon] We respect the events that take place in other 
countries, the treaties, and the sovereignty of other countries, 
and therefore, we limit ourselves to commenting on what we know, 
what the Mexican Government has stated, and what the media has 
reported to us. 
  Later, we will be able to provide official statements from 
the Guatemalan Government, but, for the time being, we only know 
what the Mexican Government has stated, and we stick with that 
because we respect their statements. [end recording]

  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio accepted yesterday 
afternoon the resignation of Economy Minister Fanny Dominguez de 
Estrada and named Guillermo Rodriguez Mahuad as acting minister. 
  It was officially announced last night that President de 
Leon 
decided to accept Estrada's resignation after studying the 
matter. She submitted her resignation in mid-November, shortly 
after replacing Cesar Alcides Soto Rodas. 
  Ms. Estrada resigned citing health reasons, but the 
government announced last night she will be named head of the 
Association of Nontraditional Products (Gexpront), where she 
performed a work public officials and private businessmen have 
described as successful. 
  Banker and exporter Eduardo Gonzalez Castillo is reportedly 
a 
strong contender to replace Estrada, although the possibility 
that Rodriguez may be confirmed has not been ruled out, given 
that he is also an expert in commerce and international 
businesses.

  [Text] The Guatemalan Foreign Trade Ministry said 
yesterday that the armed conflict at border towns in Chiapas 
State, Mexico is affecting free trade between the two countries 
and added that any delays have a direct bearing on the economy 
because exports lose their competitive edge. The ministry also 
expressed hopes that the conflict would prove temporary because 
commercial relations could be negatively affected in both Mexico 
and Guatemala. 
  The Foreign Trade Ministry emphatically denied that the 
meeting between Mexican and Guatemalan trade authorities 
scheduled for 30 November in Tabasco was suspended due to the 
recent armed conflicts, saying that the meeting was postponed 
for administrative and strategic reasons and noting that the 
conflicts had not even begun when the decision was made. The 
Foreign Trade Ministry also emphasized that talks are being held 
with Mexican economic authorities to establish new routes for 
the products. 
  If the armed conflict continues, it is highly probable that 
trade will practically come to a standstill, thus bringing 
negative consequences, the ministry concluded.

  [Text] As of 12 January and for 15 days the Guatemalan 
Government will stage a diplomatic offensive throughout the 
countries of America and most of Western Europe to inform them 
of two specific issues: peace and human rights in Ramiro de 
Leon's government. 
  This information was disclosed at a news conference by 
Foreign Minister Arturo Fajardo Maldonado, who said the 
offensive in question will be conducted by representatives from 
the Foreign Ministry, the Presidential Commission for the 
Coordination of Human Rights Affairs (Copredeh), and the 
Guatemalan Government's Peace Commission. 
  Fajardo added that the plan has already been distributed to 
six specific groups and that in his own case he will be abroad 
for a week, during which he will visit the United States, 
Canada, and certain South American countries. 
  The foreign minister explained that resources for the trips 
will be taken from the regular budgets of the concerned 
government institutions, although he added that diplomacy 
requires some investment to fulfill its duties. 
  Fajardo Maldonado also announced that President De Leon 
Carpio will visit Mexico in January to meet with his 
counterpart, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, although this trip is 
not connected to the recent armed events on the border between 
the two countries. 
  Similar circumstances surround the president's trip to Costa 
Rica, although this trip may be postponed until February, given 
that elections will be held in that country soon. 
  Fajardo also confirmed his own and President De Leon's 
attendance at the inauguration of Honduran President Carlos 
Roberto Reina, to which both have been invited; the inauguration 
has been scheduled for 27 January. 
  The foreign minister also used the occasion to refute 
statements by Government Spokesman Felix Loarca Guzman to the 
effect that Guatemala has not yet decided to support any of the 
candidates to the OAS general secretaryship. 
  Alleging a slip of the tongue by Loarca, the top diplomat 
said that Guatemala's position is clearly that it supports the 
candidacy of Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus, which 
is established in a pledge made from the time of the San 
Salvador summit in 1991 and at subsequent summits, including the 
last one, which was held in Guatemala. 
  Fajardo said that the president has full confidence in him 
and that he will continue in his post, due to which he has 
already called for specific foreign policy jobs, although he 
explained that he has not directly discussed this issue with de 
Leon Carpio. 
  To conclude, Fajardo said that it is up to the government to 
grant approval to Belizean Ambassador Atly Morales, because 
diplomatic approvals are to be included in a general policy that 
will be established with the participation of all the social 
sectors.

<F P=106> [Report on an "exclusive" interview with Honduran President </F>
Rafael Leonardo Callejas in Comayagua; date not given; from "The 
Morning Paper" newscast; passages within quotation marks 
recorded] 
  [Text] President Rafael Leonardo Callejas has said that he 
opposes a reduction in the price of fuel in the amount that has 
been announced, because this would leave Dr. Carlos Roberto 
Reina without a protective cushion. He also said that he will 
begin a tour in March, as a politician, through all of Honduras 
to try to restore the National Party [PN]. 
  President Callejas, who inaugurated the Siguatepeque 
Municipal Palace at a cost of 3 million lempiras, has said that 
he disagrees with the U.S. Embassy, which accuses Honduras of 
being irresponsible and of not honoring the rights of American 
citizens regarding properties, which, according to the law, 
belong to the Honduran state; an example of this is the United 
Nations Park. 
  An example of a good situation between Honduras and the 
United States is the contract I have just signed with the U.S. 
Motorola Company, which at a cost of $25 million will install 
cellular telephones in our country, Callejas said, adding: We 
have also signed a contract for $60 million to install a 
25-megawatt power plant. 
  [Callejas] "I am concerned sometimes about radical positions 
that U.S. foreign policy sometimes adopts. One of the largest 
U.S. telecommunications companies, Motorola, was granted the day 
before yesterday a contract to install cellular phones, and it 
will invest more than $25 million. We have just signed a 
contract for the installation of a 50-megawatt [as heard] 
private power plant by a U.S. company at a cost of $60 million. 
This means that while the U.S. Embassy--especially U.S. foreign 
policy--is trying to create difficulties around the problems 
concerning the properties of certain Americans in the country, 
sectors from the U.S. economy are coming here to invest over 
$100 million." 
  Concerning the properties for which certain American 
citizens 
are fighting, Callejas said he will ask the Supreme Court to 
explain each case so that the people can find out to where the 
U.S. Embassy wants to irresponsibly lead our country. 
  [Callejas] "As for the lands, there is much that remains to 
be said. Actually, one of the problems has been the way in 
which many Americans have come here to buy lands, especially in 
Islas de la Bahia, even though the Constitution states that no 
foreign citizen can buy lands located 40 km from the border. 
  "What has happened in the past is that the offices of the 
mayor first determined which urban areas could be sold and then 
sold the plots of land and properties; this created certain 
difficulties regarding the legitimacy of the lands. Very often 
the lands were just leased for long periods. 
  "I recognize that when an American has the right the law 
should protect him, but what I perceive is that attempts are 
being made to create the impression that all Americans have this 
right, because their position is the correct one. I do not 
agree with that, because many Americans come to our country and 
violate the law, and that does not give them the right to be 
protected by the state's judicial systems. The courts are there 
to solve it. 
  "I would ask the media and, especially, the Supreme Court to 
inform about each one of these cases so that we cannot end up 
believing that everything the United States does is ethical, 
correct, and right. There are U.S. citizens who may have the 
right, and there are others who do not." 
  The president said he will not sign any more contracts and 
has instructed the Comptroller General's Office not to carry out 
these types of actions that could create problems for the next 
government. 
  [Callejas] "I would like to refer to this. I have recently 
seen, with a certain degree of concern, accusations being made 
permanently in the media, especially concerning new contracts or 
actions taken by the government. I would like to inform the 
Honduran people that I asked the Comptroller General's Office 
not to authorize new contracts toward the end of my 
administration, so as to avoid problems. 
  "We want to clear up any doubts that may exist regarding the 
actions taken by my government. There are certain charges that 
lack totally any basis. The sale of the (Cobasa) Company is 
something about which we have not even thought. No sale has 
been made, and we do not even have time to hold a public bid; 
that will be the next government's responsibility. 
  "I saw in a Tegucigalpa newspaper today a serious accusation 
against a public official simply because he traveled to the PRC, 
and instead of taking the daily allowance of $250, he took $400, 
which was what the board of directors had authorized. The 
newspaper reported it on the front page as an act of corruption. 
One thing is trying to get the sympathy of the moral 
revolution and the next government, and another is to have the 
fundamental basis not to make accusations that can adversely 
affect people, who have been honest throughout their lives." 
  Concerning the reductions in the price of gasoline-- which 
have been announced at 1.40 lempiras per gallon--Callejas said 
he opposes it, because it would leave Dr. Carlos Roberto Reina 
without a protective cushion if prices fluctuate. He said 
currency devaluations could occur before March. Callejas said 
he will ask the Economy Ministry to reduce prices by only 1 
lempira per gallon; otherwise, it would be an irresponsible 
thing to do by his government. 
  [Callejas] "There has been a substantial reduction in oil 
prices internationally, and our policy is that when there is a 
change in prices of more than 5 percent, the price is 
transferred to the consumer. I have seen some figures in the 
media with which I do not necessarily agree, especially 
regarding the reduction that should be passed on to the 
consumer. This reduction does not consider the new gasoline 
price increases in the upcoming shipments or currency 
devaluations. I sincerely do not want to leave the next 
government the immediate responsibility of having to increase 
prices. 
  "I will probably discuss the reduction in prices with the 
Economy Ministry. The next government should have a small 
cushion which can allow it to work based on currency 
fluctuations or international prices at least until March. I 
can tell the Honduran people that there will be a gasoline price 
reduction, but it will not be the kind of reduction included in 
the proposal brought to me by the Economy Ministry. Instead of 
1.40 lempira, it will probably be a 1- lempira reduction." 
  On his private life the president said that he will travel 
to 
Miami and New York starting 27 February to have his shoulder 
examined, as he is experiencing pain. In March he will conduct 
his first national tour to restore unity and recover power in 
the next elections. He will be accompanied by the National 
Party's central committee, but he hopes the February convention 
will elect the new National Party authorities with whom he will 
tour all of Honduras. 
  [Callejas] "In February I will conduct a private visit to 
the 
United States, particularly in Miami and New York. I want 
doctors to take a look at my shoulder, because I am still 
feeling pain in the muscle and tendon in the right shoulder. I 
will visit the doctor and then travel to New York with my wife 
to rest. I will return in March to participate in the business 
firms with which I am an associate or owner. I am also going to 
try to contribute to the new political options of the National 
Party. I hope to visit the different departments of the country 
in March. I want to tell the people there that the National 
Party believes unity is essential for recovering power. We 
believe that clearly established processes of democratic 
participation are essential as well." 
  Finally, the president of the Republic, in this exclusive 
interview with Voz de Honduras, said that the debts owed by his 
party's transportation workers will be paid off within the next 
few days. He said a meeting with the finance commission was 
held, and the funds are now available at a banking institution 
so that transportation workers can collect the money. They 
should not be concerned, he said.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 4 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran 
President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina said today that his 
government will follow up on the investigation of disappearances 
of 183 people over the past 10 years in this Central American 
country. 
  Reina, winner of the November 1993 elections, told local 
media that the preliminary 29 December report presented by Leo 
Valladares, national human rights ombudsman, "is a very 
courageous" document and that its recommendations should be 
followed. 
  The report, which states that civilian and military 
personnel 
are responsible for the forced disappearances of dozens of 
people, "is a thorough study in which the truth is evident. Its 
effects will be proportionate to the courage with which the 
information is managed," said Reina, who will be sworn in on 27 
January. 
  Supreme Court President Orlando Lozano Martinez announced 
that the judicial branch will also follow up on Valladares' 
report. 
  A Judicial Branch plenum resolved that Honduran judges in 
charge of criminal cases in places where both citizens and 
foreigners have reportedly suffered forced disappearances must 
begin or continue trials to punish the culprits. 
  The Supreme Court also formed a special commission of 
prosecutors to study the national human rights ombudsman's 
report and to proceed with the corresponding legal actions. 
  The Attorney General's Office, which will appoint a 
prosecutor next week, will continue the work done by the 
[Supreme Court] prosecutors. 
  Human rights organizations are demanding that Division 
General [as received] Luis Alonso Discua, chief of the Armed 
Forces, be investigated in connection with several 
disappearances that took place while he was commander of the 
so-called "3-16" counterintelligence battalion in 1984. 
  The Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras 
(COFADEH) on 7 January will request at the Legislative Assembly 
that Discua be temporarily suspended so he can be investigated 
in connection with the disappearances, a request which, in 
President Rafael Callejas' opinion, "lacks any legal basis and 
will not be considered." 
  Discua, who examined the report on the disappearances with 
Callejas on 3 January, has made no comment, although on various 
occasions he has said he had no part in the violations. 
  Callejas said on 3 January that the report should not be 
used 
to open new wounds but to unite rather than divide the Honduran 
family. Carlos Sosa Coello, a deputy for the minority Social 
Democratic Innovation and Unity Party (PINU-SD), feels that Gen. 
Discua should be summoned by the Legislative Assembly to hear 
his views concerning the disappearances and that the state 
should compensate and apologize to the missing detainees' 
relatives. 
  Legislative Assembly Vice President Marco Augusto Hernandez 
said that if any conclusive evidence is found implicating Discua 
in the forced disappearances, he should be separated from his 
post. 
  Human Rights Commissioner Leo Valladares is of the opinion 
that a pardon cannot be granted in the case of the 
disappearances if the alleged perpetrators do not admit their 
culpability. 
  Valladares also asked the Armed Forces to open its files to 
facilitate the investigations. 
  "Reconciliation is sought through the search for truth and 
the implementation of justice," said Valladares, who also 
believes that the law will determine who is guilty. 
  The report on the disappearances also names U.S. and 
Argentine military officers and former Nicaraguan "contra" 
fighters who operated out of Honduras during the eighties.

  [Text] Yesterday, Economy Minister Carlos Chahin urged 
legal authorities to resolve the problem of illegal land 
expropriations from some 30 U.S. citizens because it is 
jeopardizing foreign investment in the country. 
  These statements were made following publication of an 
edition of the U.S. newspaper THE NEW HERALD, in which an 
official of the U.S. Embassy in Honduras warned investors about 
the risks of investing in Honduras due to a disrespect for the 
law. Chahin expressed his surprise over the publication since 
U.S. authorities have spoken "highly" of Honduras following the 
approval of the Copyright Law. However, Chahin said, the problem 
now is that illegal expropriations "leave a lot to be desired 
from the Honduran legal system, which makes me very sorry. 
Therefore, I must tell the next legal authorities so that they 
will be punctual and legalistic." 
  Chahin regretted that situations of this type tarnish the 
level of competitiveness Honduras offers to foreign investors by 
having the least expensive manual labor in Central America. In 
Honduras, one minute of work only costs nine cents, while in 
other countries, such as Costa Rica, it costs about 13.5 cents. 
Chahin added, "We are efficient and competitive, our assembly 
plants have the highest quality in the area, and we have the 
cheapest food staples. The only aspect we do not handle very 
well is bank interest rates because of the high legal cost." 
  Chahin noted that situations of this type jeopardize 
Honduras' benefits in the Generalized System of Preferences, 
under which over $100-million worth of products are exported 
annually to the United States.

  [Text] Given the grave incidents in Chiapas, Mexico that 
have resulted in the deaths of more than 200 Mexican citizens, 
the destruction of property, and the provocation of instability 
in that zone, the Nicaraguan Government states that it deplores 
these acts of violence and expresses its hope that a lasting, 
peaceful solution will be achieved to allow a return to normalcy. 
  The Nicaraguan Government expresses its solidarity with 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his efforts to 
find a peaceful solution to the situation within a legal 
framework. 
  The Nicaraguan Government reasserts its firm conviction that 
a dialogue held within a framework of respect for the law is the 
appropriate way to find peaceful and effective solutions to 
problems.

  [Text] A large number of military activities have occurred 
in the northern part of the country between 22 December 1993 and 
5 January 1994, according to the Nicaraguan Army's public 
relations office. Eleven clashes occurred between 22 December 
and 5 January, between irregular groups and the EPS [Sandinist 
People's Army], in the northern zone of the country. The 
irregulars have sustained 30 casualties -- four dead, 10 
injured, and 16 prisoners. All are members of different groups, 
both recontras and recompas. Two civilians were injured, two 
kidnapped, and nine killed during that time.

<F P=106> [Report by Roger Suarez] </F>
  [Text] The Conservative Popular Alliance (APC) of Dr. 
Miriam Arguello and the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement (MDN) 
have issued their respective communiques outlining their 
official positions on participation in the National Assembly and 
support for constitutional amendments. The APC's latest 
communique, which appeared today in a paid advertisement, stated 
that its deputies will fully join the Assembly sessions "to 
support any constitutional amendment bill that entails profound 
and substantial changes." 
  The MDN, APC, and UDC were expelled from the National 
Opposition Union [UNO] for failing to support the plan for a 
political movement to demand to hold elections for a constituent 
assembly. The MDN stated in a communique dated 30 December that 
"it is not possible to continue using the same strategy used in 
1993, and that active participation in the National Assembly is 
necessary to keep the electoral pledge it made to the people of 
Nicaragua." 
  "We regret that the partisan and personal interests of some 
parties within UNO wish to ignore the 1990 mandate of the people 
and call for the election of a constituent assembly to change 
the government, something that is not mentioned in any UNO 
document," the MDN indicated. The MDN feels that summoning a 
constituent assembly is not viable, "let alone changing the 
current government." 
  The APC, in turn, stated that the country's need to make 
substantial changes in its legal system prompted it to 
participate in the National Assembly. "It is essential that we 
approve laws to definitively settle all disputes that place 
obstacles in the path toward an adequate climate of confidence 
for investments, such as the solution to the ownership problem," 
the APC communique noted. 
  Another reason the conservatives headed by Miriam Arguello 
and Francisco Anzoategui gave for returning to the National 
Assembly was that the dispute that has lasted over a year in the 
Assembly prevented the approval of legitimate laws. In 
congressional circles, Arguello's appointment as chairwoman of 
the commission in charge of studying and issuing a report on the 
constitutional amendments is taken for granted. 
  The APC board of directors stated in its communique that it 
has decided to maintain relations with parties, institutions, 
and trade groups that wish to make a positive effort to find the 
path toward solving the nation's problems. The board members 
affirmed they will maintain the party's independence regarding 
their positions and decisions in line with their principles and 
programs. 
  The expulsion of the UDC, APC, and MDN from the UNO ranks 
and 
the announcement of marches in favor of the constituent assembly 
are creating internal friction in parties such as the PSD 
[Social Democratic Party]. During a meeting of the PSD National 
Executive Center [CEN] yesterday, there was a heated debate 
about the party's official position to support the summons to a 
constituent assembly. 
  The Social Democratic Women's Front today harshly criticized 
PSD Secretary General Alfredo Cesar, accusing him of taking the 
party to extremist stances. The social democratic women issued 
a communique asking that a general assembly be held to hold new 
general elections to replace or confirm the current CEN and to 
consider the PSD's participation or exclusion from UNO.

<F P=106> [Report by Claudia Siria; from the "National Newscast;" </F>
passages within quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] Adolfo Jarquin Ortel, director of the Social 
Democratic Party [PSD], summoned the party's rank and file 
membership to elect new authorities, something that reflects the 
serious infighting within that organization. He warned that he 
will sue party President Guillermo Potoy for slander. Crises 
within the seven parties [of the National Opposition Union, UNO] 
worsened when National Conservative Party [PNC] member Edmundo 
Castillo decided to back the constitutional reforms. Tomorrow 
the party's directorate meets to change officers. 
  [Jarquin, in progress] "...we believe the time has come for 
us to take the party's leadership and not play into the hands of 
those who have personal interests at stake." 
  Adolfo Jarquin Ortel, who along with other UNO deputies will 
join the National Assembly on 10 January, was accused by the PSD 
president of having been bribed [canoneado] with thousands of 
dollars. 
  [Potoy] "Corruption has raised doubts about PSD operations." 
  [Jarquin] "I am considering taking legal action against 
Potoy." 
  Meanwhile, Alfredo Cesar said that those who favor a 
constituent assembly really seek to move elections ahead to next 
year. 
  [Cesar] "The moment the constituent assembly is elected [as 
heard] it will decide to leave or remove governments." 
  [Jarquin] "We disagree with them. This has been their idea. 
Everyone in this country knows that we voted for a president 
like Dona Violeta for her to complete her term through 1996. 
The international community supports Dona Violeta completing 
her Constitutional term...." 
  Jarquin accused Liberals and Conservatives of competing for 
a 
power take over through an early campaign. Meanwhile, the seven 
parties that favor a constituent assembly said they have funds 
to call for elections that would cost the country about $30 
million. 
  [Deputy Frank Duarte, secretary of the National Assembly] 
"Engineer Cesar no doubt continues to deceive the Nicaraguan 
people by making them believe there is a fund to finance those 
elections. In the best of cases it would be financed by the 
National Assembly and we have heard nothing of the sort." 
  The crises also affected the PNC because Edmundo Castillo 
rebelled against the Constituent Assembly and said he will join 
the National Assembly. Dr. Castillo accused the UNO Political 
Council of being two-faced and acting with a double standard. 
  [Castillo] "Enough said about being two-faced and having 
double standards. We need to be at the assembly, we must defend 
the peoples' interests." 
  [Siria] "At one time your group also charged that the Center 
Group had been bribed. What will happen now that you also are 
accused of receiving bribes, will you also sue?" 
  [Castillo] "I believe that if someone dares to say this I 
will file criminal charges. Not only will I file criminal 
charges but I will respond like a man...."

  [Excerpts] Panama City, 9 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Various 
political, labor, and student organizations marched today in 
Panama City to commemorate the 30th anniversary of clashes with 
U.S. troops on 9 January 1964, when 23 Panamanians died and 
diplomatic relations were temporarily broken. [passage omitted] 
  A mass was held today at the San Juan Bosco Basilica to 
honor 
the "9 January Martyrs," and dozens of people later marched 
toward the U.S. Southern Command Headquarters on Ancon Hill 
beside the canal, where they burned an effigy dressed in a U.S. 
military uniform. 
  Approximately 200 persons marched along Central Avenue 
chanting anti-U.S. and antigovernment slogans while the 
Panamanian flag flew at half mast in the distance on Ancon Hill. 
[passage omitted] 
  The absence of representatives from Guillermo Endara's 
administration was quite evident in today's events.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Arnulfist Party in Panama City on </F>
7 January -- read by Alfredo Arias, head of the Arnulfist 
Party's negotiating team; from "RPC Television News"] 
  [Text] Good afternoon to all the news media and the 
Panamanian people who are listening to me. The following is a 
communique released by the Arnulfist Party [PA]. 
  Over the past few months the democratic government alliance 
held talks for the purpose of nominating a presidential 
candidate who would give continuity to the government that 
emerged from the 7 May 1989 elections. 
  The PA, which has traditionally never been defeated in an 
election and which has a considerably larger membership than any 
of its ally parties, has an express mandate to head the 
presidential ticket that has been proclaimed by the National 
Directorate, the Consultative Board, and each of the provincial 
assemblies held by convention delegates across the length and 
breadth of the country, all of whom have patiently waited for 
their allies to reach a decision. 
  For the people's well-being and for the country's democratic 
future, with less time to process and present lists of 
candidates for all levels of popular election, heeding the 
demands of our fellow party members who want to begin their 
electoral campaigns with a view to the upcoming elections, and 
due to evident efforts to prolong the talks indefinitely, we 
have been forced to end the lengthy negotiation period. 
  The understanding is that the PA is now free to form new 
alliances with political parties that will join it for the 
current election campaign under the leadership of Mrs. Mireya 
Moscoso de Gruber. 
  Issued in Panama on the 7 January 1994. [applause]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Panamanian President Guillermo </F>
Endara by Julio Miller, RPC general news director; place not 
given; from the "RPC Television News" newscast--live] 
  [Text] [Miller] I am on the telephone with the president 
of the Republic to get his reaction to the Arnulfist Party's 
[PA] decision to stop negotiating with its ally parties. Mr. 
President, what is your first reaction to this announcement by 
the PA leadership? 
  [Endara] I must say with regret that I will refrain from 
making any political statements due to the pledge I made to the 
Panamanian people at the National Theater in November, when I 
swore that I would remain impartial and would not involve the 
state and Presidency in political activities. Regarding my 
government, I must say that the PA's decision does not disband 
the government alliance; it means that it has been impossible to 
form an alliance for the 1994 elections. I know this will have 
certain consequences for the government, but I believe [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Miller] Mr. President, along those same lines, what will 
happen with Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] 
ministers who are in your cabinet? 
  [Endara] I am not planning to ask any of my ministers to 
resign. 
  [Miller] This disruption of the talks leads to the 
assumption that the alliance has been broken off, however. 
  [Endara] The break is political and concerns the 1994 
elections. This, unquestionably, might and very likely will 
affect my government, but my duty as president of the Republic 
and of all Panamanians is to diminish as much as possible the 
effects of the schism. 
  [Miller] Don't you believe this situation will benefit other 
political candidates? 
  [Endara] That is a political comment, and I prefer to 
refrain from answering. 
  [Miller] How do you respond to the views expressed by 
certain government leaders that ethics dictate that Molirena 
cabinet ministers should resign and not wait for you to change 
them? 
  [Endara] I do not know who made that comment, but I would 
not ask any minister from Molirena or any other party to resign. 
  [Miller] Mr. President, what do you believe will happen from 
this point on? 
  [Endara] I will pray to God to help me during these 
difficult times--which they are, unquestionably--and to help me 
overcome any negative or harmful effects this situation may have 
on my government. I want this period to go down in history as a 
true model electoral period for future governments. 
  [Miller] Mr. President, are you not under the impression 
that too many political parties that are not the parties that 
formed the alliance which is now in power and was once a civic 
movement are aspiring to political power? 
  [Endara] I can understand, more or less, what is happening 
to these presidential hopefuls, because I went through a similar 
struggle; therefore, I cannot throw the first stone in that 
sense. I know that, at least in my opinion, service as president 
of the Republic is not something you seek because you like it. 
The exercise of power is, rather, a sacrifice on the people's 
behalf; therefore, I believe that altruistic and not private 
interests should prevail in these affairs. Within altruistic 
interests there can be differences. I understand this perfectly 
well, because I have experienced all of those things. 
  [Miller] A final question, Mr. President. Along those same 
lines, isn't it true that this schism favors the political party 
and the deposed military regime that the current government 
opposed? 
  [Endara] I would like to answer you, Julio, but I must 
abstain from doing so. I am very sorry, but I must not answer 
your question.

  [Text] Canadian Foreign Trade Minister (Roy MacLaren) said 
that, for Canada, Chile is first on the list of countries 
wishing to join NAFTA. The official held a joint news conference 
with Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley within the framework of 
his official visit to the country, which ended on 6 January and 
during which he reviewed the present status of Chilean-Canadian 
economic and trade relations. 
  Regarding the importance for smaller economies to associate 
themselves with the United States, Minister (MacLaren) said his 
party, the Liberal Party, had been in the opposition until last 
year and was a critical opponent of an agreement with the United 
States because it was involved in unfair practices and 
maintained subsidies. This situation was partly solved thanks to 
NAFTA and GATT, the minister said. 
  Foxley and (MacLaren) outlined the growing Canadian 
investment in Chile, which reached $4 billion, stressing that it 
will continue to grow this year through the association contract 
between Codelco [Copper Corporation] Chile and a consortium that 
includes the Canadian firm (Luck Minerals) to exploit the Laura 
field. 
  The minister on 6 January participated in a meeting with 
government authorities and Eduardo Aninat and Carlos Figueroa, 
[finance and foreign ministers-designate, respectively] two of 
President-elect Eduardo Frei's cabinet members.

<F P=106> [Interview with Juan Villarzu, economic adviser to </F>
President-elect Eduardo Frei, by Raquel Correa; place and date 
not given -- first four paragraphs are author's introduction] 
  [Text] Although he does not yet have Carabinero [National 
Police] guards at the door of his house in Vitacura, he 
certainly has the look of a cabinet minister, which he cannot 
hide. It is an "open secret" that if Eduardo Frei is elected 
president, Juan Villarzu will be his minister of finance. 
  He feels uncomfortable about this "assumption." However, as 
the man in charge of the economic program of the Concertacion 
coalition, he was willing to answer our questions. He 
emphasized: "There has been no discussion about who will head 
which ministry. Eduardo has been very clear about that. First, 
we have to win the election." 
  Villarzu Rohde is 49 years old and is married to Maria 
Olivia 
Avalos. They have three children of their own, in addition to 
two children from her first marriage, and one granddaughter. He 
is of Basque and German descent. He thinks that the German blood 
which he inherited from his mother, "a German woman born in 
Germany," is the predominant force in his character. 
  He was practically an only child. (His sister died at an 
early age.) He was educated in the rigorous program at the 
Colegio Aleman [German College]. Hence his sense of discipline 
and the demands he makes on himself. He has a calm and 
methodical outlook. 
  [Correa] Are you hard or soft? 
  [Villarzu] Neither hard nor soft. I am rather firm in my 
convictions. 
  [Correa] Are you more a politician or more an economist? 
  [Villarzu] "I find that I am more of an economist, although 
many people say no." (He laughs discreetly.) "I feel more 
comfortable as an economist." Having had broad, executive 
experience, he is recognized as having "good leadership 
qualities and the ability to direct groups." He is reflective, 
"although also rather intuitive." He says that he believes very 
much in what he would call "guts"--"what makes me feel things. I 
tend to concentrate on the major arguments for or against 
something." 
  [Correa] And when you have made a decision, are you able to 
change your mind? 
  [Villarzu] "I am capable of thinking things over. However, 
frankly, I am a little stubborn." 
  On economic matters in general he says: "I am a great 
believer in competition as a very central element in the 
functioning of the economy. I believe in efforts to improve the 
way markets operate. The only way for Chile to achieve stable 
development over the medium term of years is in an economic 
structure which is increasingly more open to the world." 
  [Correa] More open than it already is? 
  [Villarzu] In the sense of the view over the long term, I 
have no doubt about it. That means making greater efforts at 
integration with Latin America. 
  [Correa] Does that mean giving priority to economic treaties 
with the Third World? 
  [Villarzu] Our natural habitat is Latin America. I am not 
among those who believe in saying, "Goodbye, Latin America." 
  [Correa] Would you rather be on the side of the losers? 
  [Villarzu] "No. I believe that, over the long term, Latin 
America will be among the winners. Argentina and Bolivia are 
going in that direction. In general, so is the rest of Latin 
America. I also believe that we can make much more progress in 
opening up the Chilean economy from the financial point of view." 
  The other principle in which he firmly believes--although he 
refuses to consider himself an "original thinker" in this 
regard--is stability. 
  He said: "I believe very strongly in the need to continue 
reducing inflation." 
  [Correa] When do you hope to reach single digit inflation? 
  [Villarzu] "In 1997." 
  In his economic credo there is also the view, "that the 
people can build their own future with their own resources. This 
is the idea of investment in people." "I am convinced that a 
mixture of adequate, macroeconomic policies, including opening 
up the economy and investing in the people, is the recipe for 
success. If you add political and social stability to that, you 
have all of the ingredients to turn us into an economic tiger 
some day." 
  He explains meticulously, "When I talk about an open 
economy, 
I am talking about a market economy where the principal, 
productive element is the private sector, in its different 
forms." 
  [Correa] Did you learn that at the University of Chicago?" 
  [Villarzu] I have always thought that. This is the Christian 
Democratic view of things. 
  [Correa] Did you support the establishment of "a 
communitarian society?" 
  [Villarzu] The concept of a communitarian society 
traditionally accepted the idea that private parties were 
essentially private. However, then we gave priority to the idea 
of companies owned by the workers, and in these the state has 
always played a subsidiary role. The social doctrine of the 
[Catholic] Church was the first to introduce into Chile the idea 
of a subordinate role for the state. Then the Christian 
Democratic movement incorporated this idea into its view of 
economic development. 
  [Correa] Are you getting ready to use the stairways to climb 
the 12 floors of the Ministry of Finance? 
  [Villarzu] He laughed openly and said: "I do not think that 
I 
could. I am a half frustrated sportsman. I always try to engage 
in sports. What I do more regularly is play tennis." 
  He is a good skier and has tried to play golf. He said: 
"Chess interests me very much and especially bridge." He makes a 
practice of riding his bike through his neighborhood. However, 
he is not very determined about sports. He said: "The only 
consistent thing is that I always try to engage in some kind of 
physical activity." 
  His favorite weekends are spent at his home in Zapallar, 
"which we visit as often as possible." 
  He is devoted to reading, from technical books--including 
books on economic theory--to the poetry of Garcia Lorca. He 
misses his university offices (He was chairman of the 
Departments of Economics at the University of Chile and the 
Catholic University of Chile). Over the past few months he has 
spent all of his time on the economic program of the 
Concertacion coalition. 
  He is rather reserved. He prefers to spend his time in the 
company of friends and hates gambling. He likes to dance and 
says that he is "good at rock and roll dancing." On his list of 
"things to learn" he said that he has included the tango. When 
he talks about "salsa" music, the methodical, serious, and 
inhibited man that he seems to be disappears completely. He is 
also devoted to jazz and classical music. His favorite composer 
is Mozart. 
  He is a successful businessman and international consultant. 
He believes that, "My heart is more inclined toward economics. 
From my involvement in economics I have had close contact with 
the business world but, in fact, I have given up being a 
businessman. However, although I have done rather well, to tell 
you the truth, this is not what has given me the most 
satisfaction. I feel much more comfortable in activity connected 
to the public service and the government." 
  [Correa] Would you feel very disappointed if Frei were 
elected and he did not offer you the Ministry of Finance? 
  [Villarzu] This economist, who was born in Arica and is a 
graduate of the University of Chicago, spoke very seriously and 
was in perfect control of himself when he replied: 
  "No. Frankly, I would like to be a part of the next 
government, but that does not mean doing so in any particular 
ministry. I believe that I am in a position to make a 
contribution in different areas and as a function of what the 
president considers appropriate. I believe that if Frei is 
elected, he will set his stamp on the government." 
  [Correa] And what is the "Frei stamp"? 
  [Villarzu] Senator Frei gives priority to teamwork. He gives 
a great deal of freedom to those who work with him so that they 
can fully develop their potential. He listens a great deal and 
makes decisions with a great sense of timeliness. It is very 
difficult to force him to make decisions. 
  [Correa] Are you an unusual "Chicago boy"? 
  [Villarzu] "Chicago boys" here are known as those who 
received an undergraduate degree at the Catholic University of 
Chile. But some of us also went to the University of 
Chile--Carlos Massad, Andres Sanfuentes, and Roberto Zahler. In 
general, their view of the role of the economy and of national 
development is rather different from the view of those 
considered to be "Chicago boys." 
  [Correa] But the recipe which you brought back to an 
economically prostrate Chile was the most "Chicago style" of all. 
  [Villarzu] There are elements--such as stability, an open 
economy, opening up the economy to the world, and 
competition--which are considered of very central importance at 
the School of Economics of the University of Chicago. Even on 
the subject of investment the people at the University of 
Chicago were pioneers. This is the neoclassical view of the 
economy. However, you have to keep in mind that Jorge Cauas, who 
was a key figure in formulating the economic policy of the 
Military Government, was not of the Chicago school. 
  [Correa] Which economist should go down in history as the 
leader of that process? 
  [Villarzu] "There were different phases. Cauas played a much 
more important role during a very critical period at the 
beginning of the Military Government." During that phase 
Villarzu himself was director of the budget. "The opening up of 
the economy began in a real way in 1975 when Jorge Cauas was 
minister of finance. He had a great deal of support from De 
Castro. If I had to list the most important names, I would 
mention Cauas, De Castro, and Miguel Kast, three men who were of 
the greatest importance in the formulation of what was called 
`the model.'" 
  [Correa] He was more important than Buchi? 
  [Villarzu] Buchi was important because during the 1982-1983 
crisis the "model" was almost completely abandoned. He returned 
to the central line of the economic policies begun in 1974. He 
succeeded in reestablishing credibility and in redirecting the 
economy. He deserves a great deal of credit for that. 
  [Correa] What was "the great achievement" of Foxley? 
  [Villarzu] He succeeded in giving form to the model of 
growth 
with equity which brought in more important elements of 
macroeconomic leadership, adding to it, and with great 
determination, the component of social justice. The neoliberal 
view of Buchi gave priority to growth as the central, 
controlling element of the strategy of development, 
fundamentally supported by the activity of the private sector 
and minimizing state activity to the maximum extent. And the 
people profited because the benefits of that growth sooner or 
later went to them. 
  [Correa] And is that not correct? Can there be development 
without growth? 
  [Villarzu] The fact is that in a society like that of Chile, 
where great social differences coexist, side by side, it must be 
assumed that a third party--the Armed Forces or an authoritarian 
government--will guarantee political, economic, and social 
stability. In a free society it is very difficult for an economy 
to move forward quickly in coexistence with economic sectors 
living in extreme poverty. The "Buchi model" presupposed that 
social conflict will be regulated in another way. 
  [Correa] Does this mean that Buchi would not have been 
successful in a democracy? 
  [Villarzu] Exactly. A refusal to raise pensions to allow for 
inflation and adjusting the economy by decreasing spending on 
health, education, and infrastructure would have generated such 
tension that it would have been impossible to succeed in 
maintaining growth. In a free society long term growth is 
maintained in a framework of political and social stability. 
That presupposes that all Chileans clearly perceive that the 
benefits of the efforts made are distributed equitably. 
  [Correa] But that is not the situation today. 
  [Villarzu] We have made significant progress. And that is 
the 
fundamental difference between the "Buchi model" and the "Foxley 
model." The economy has grown at an average of 6.3 percent over 
the past four years. This is practically the same as during the 
last five years of the Military Government, when the figure was 
6.4 percent. Simultaneously, inflation has declined from about 
30 percent annually, which is what we had at the end of 1989, to 
about 12 or 12.5 percent in 1993. The external position of the 
country is much more solid, so solid that it will make it 
possible for us to resolve our international crisis without any 
difficulty. 
  [Correa] But the economy is shrinking, and it is expected 
that 1994 will be "a discouraging year." 
  [Villarzu] I do not think so. Investment, which is what 
makes 
it possible to maintain long-term growth, has been 
extraordinarily high in the private sector. The coefficient of 
investment--the proportion between investment and Gross Domestic 
Product--will exceed 27 percent. During this election year, when 
investment normally tends to stop, private investment will grow 
between 15 and 20 percent in real terms. During the 
administration of President Aylwin the economy has performed 
better than it did during the best years of the Military 
Government, the period from 1985 to 1989. And, simultaneously, 
notable progress has been made on social matters, such as 
reducing the number of the poor to about 1.3 million. Among the 
poor about 800,000 are destitute. Between 1985 and 1989 minimum 
salaries fell by 2.7 percent in real terms. During 1993 they 
will grow by about 10 percent, on the average. The rate of 
unemployment has declined to a substantial extent. 
  [Correa] The average growth rate of 6.4 percent during the 
period in office of the present administration will decline to 
4.0 or 5.0 percent. Some people say that it will decline even 
more. 
  [Villarzu] During the present administration the economy 
grew 
at an average rate of 6.3 percent, despite the fact that in 1990 
it grew by only 3.0 percent, as a result of the restrictive 
measures taken to slow down too rapid an expansion of the 
economy, in part caused by the expansionist policy followed by 
the previous administration for what were, I believe, electoral 
purposes. That situation made it necessary to cool off the 
economy. 
  [Correa] And what will the next administration inherit from 
the present one? [Villarzu] Starting in 1993, the Chilean 
economy began to feel the full force of the international 
situation--a recession in Europe and stagnation in the United 
States and Japan. That process began at the end of 1990, and the 
greatest impact was felt in the United States in 1991, the only 
year in which the North American economy recorded a net decline. 
That situation will have less of an impact in Chile in 1993 than 
in the past because we have diversified our export base. 
  And now a third of our exports are going to other countries 
in the Americas; a third of our exports are going to Asia and 
the Pacific; and a third of our exports are going to Europe and 
the Middle East. As the impact of the international 
deterioration has not been the same everywhere, that has also 
made it possible for us to deal with it more effectively. We are 
feeling the impact of the recession now because, in addition to 
the decline in demand, the prices of some of our key export 
products have fallen. This effect will be with us during part of 
1994. 
  [Correa] Will it be stronger than it was in 1993? 
  [Villarzu] No. It is difficult to see how prices--such as 
that for copper--could deteriorate more than they have up to 
this point. The average price will be lower than it was in 1993 
but not lower than it is today. I would say that the worst 
period of the international recession is already over. We are 
feeling its impact, which will continue with us for some time 
and then will change as the world economy becomes more active. 
Already there are clear signs of recovery in the external 
economy. For example, it is expected that in 1993 the United 
States will have a minimum growth rate of 2.7 percent. Some 
people are talking about a figure closer to 3.0 percent in 1994. 
In Europe, where the most complicated case is Germany, it is 
estimated that in 1993 there will be a decline of between 2.0 
and 2.5 percent in Gross Domestic Product. However, virtually 
all of the analysts are talking about a recovery in the German 
economy in 1994. That is a situation reflected in all of the 
economies of the world. The recovery will be slow, and we will 
feel its effects toward the end of 1994 or the beginning of 
1995. There be a year of slower growth in 1994 than 1993. The 
year 1993 was not a "bad year" for an economy which grows at 
that level, when the world economy has grown by an average of 
about 2.0 percent. 
  [Correa] Is there no danger of a new adjustment? 
  [Villarzu] No. The adjustment has been taking place only 
gradually. When an economy like that of Chile--which exports 35 
percent of its Gross Domestic Product--encounters weak, external 
demand, there is less domestic activity. That is what is 
happening. 
  [Correa] If you were minister of finance, would you favor 
expanding or diminishing the role of the state? 
  [Villarzu] I am for strengthening the state. Not enlarging 
it 
but giving it the necessary tools to transform itself by 
articulating the process of development and the common efforts 
being made by employers, workers, and society. 
  [Correa] You have said that you are in favor of privatizing 
"everything that can be privatized." Where would you begin? 
  [Villarzu] I would begin with companies which are not 
private 
monopolies and which are engaged in open activities. 
  [Correa] Would you privatize CODELCO [Chilean Copper 
Corporation] under any circumstances? 
  [Villarzu] Under no circumstances. Candidate Alessandri used 
to say that he would privatize CODELCO, but later he changed his 
mind. CODELCO is a strategic enterprise. It must be made into an 
efficient one. That is the most profitable kind of company that 
we could have. 
  [Correa] Chile has assets worth billions of dollars which 
bring in an average return of 3.0 percent. Without CODELCO that 
return would decline to 0.5 percent. Do you not consider that 
sufficient proof of inefficiency? 
  [Villarzu] No. Among that group of state-owned companies is 
ENACAR [National Coal Enterprise], which loses a lot of money. 
The company is engaged in a process of rationalization and 
reconversion. State companies should be in a position to operate 
as if they were private companies. Therefore, we are preparing a 
draft Statute of Public Enterprises. We must insist that they be 
as efficient and open in their operations as if they were 
private corporations. 
  [Correa] Regarding the program for modernizing CODELCO, are 
you prepared to reduce employment by 4,000, since, according to 
some studies, these workers are no longer needed by the company? 
  [Villarzu] We are prepared to do so gradually, in agreement 
with the workers. 
  [Correa] Do you support a free-floating rate of exchange? 
  [Villarzu] I am not so much a supporter of a free-floating 
exchange rate as I am in favor of moving forward by eliminating 
a series of foreign exchange restrictions now in effect which, 
in view of the world situation and the level of development of 
the Chilean market, are no longer justified. 
  [Correa] Which of the laws pending approval by Congress are 
the most urgent? 
  [Villarzu] The law on the capital market and the banking law 
are of vital importance. I hope that they will be approved by 
Congress before March 1994. 
  [Correa] Do you share the concern felt by Minister of 
Finance 
Foxley about a free trade treaty with the United States? 
  [Villarzu] The Bush administration and the present North 
American administration have expressed interest in entering into 
this kind of treaty with Chile. Conditions already exist for 
that kind of initiative to go well. We will have to begin 
negotiations on that treaty at some point in 1994. Foxley is 
ending his term of office, leaving that loaf of bread, as it 
were, ready to go into the oven. However, like Alejandro Foxley, 
I think that this is a matter which will have to be handled with 
a great deal of patience. Negotiations with the United States 
will be difficult. An eventual TLC [Free Trade Treaty] with the 
United States would have advantages for Chile. However, during 
the process of negotiations we should keep very clearly in mind 
which are our own interests over the medium term of years and 
which are the interests of the United States. And we must 
consider our real possibilities, particularly with regard to the 
sectors of our economy which would be affected, positively or 
negatively, by that treaty. We have to consider the treaty 
calmly. This does not mean that we will not complete the 
negotiations as quickly as possible. Rather, we will do so, but 
very prudently. 
  [Correa] You said that public spending should be reduced, 
and 
your views have been considered to be clear criticism of 
Minister of Finance Foxley. 
  [Villarzu] No. What I said is that to ensure macroeconomic 
stability over the medium term, it is important for public 
spending not to grow more than the potential capacity of the 
economy. 
  [Correa] But it happens that public spending has been 
growing 
more quickly. 
  [Villarzu] Not on a cash basis. 
  [Correa] How can you say that? During the past three years 
public spending has grown more than Gross Domestic Product. 
  [Villarzu] That happened in 1991 and 1992 and will probably 
happen also in 1993. However, on the average, over the past four 
years, it has not grown that much. When the present 
administration entered office, it clearly pointed out that it 
had to deal with a tremendous need to make up shortcomings in 
spending, inherited from the previous government, in the areas 
of health, education, infrastructure, and housing. And to do 
this, it reached agreement with RN [the National Renovation 
party] to raise taxes to finance an increase in spending. That 
was a campaign promise regarding its program, and it was then 
supported by a great consensus in the country. 
  [Correa] If you should become responsible for state 
finances, 
in what areas would you reduce spending? 
  [Villarzu] The team which has been working on the government 
program thinks that it is not a matter of reducing spending. 
That is the first mistake which must be clarified. 
  [Correa] Then the program involves increasing spending? 
  [Villarzu] There will be slower growth in spending because, 
in effect, it will not be possible to continue the pace of 
growth of spending recorded in the years 1991 and 1992. Among 
other things, this is because we will not have new tax reform 
legislation to deal with. 
  [Correa] However, in the view of public opinion it does not 
appear that this more substantial level of spending has been 
translated into social improvement, particularly in the field of 
health, where spending has more than doubled. 
  [Villarzu] In 1989, $564 million were spent on health. In 
the 
budget for 1994 we are talking about expenditures in the 
vicinity of $1.2 billion. It is the same thing with education. 
We have to have a little patience about this. A major effort has 
been made to improve pensions, raise minimum salaries, improve 
the jobs picture, and increase spending on school lunches. This 
has been an effort which will bear fruit over the next few years. 
  [Correa] Do you not believe that what should be done is to 
change the structure of the health system? That is, subsidizing 
demand instead of subsidizing supply? 
  [Villarzu] I believe that what is being spent on health in 
Chile is considerable. However, in effect, we have not yet 
resolved the problems of providing health care. The overall 
health indicators--infant mortality, life expectancy, etc.--show 
spectacularly good results, approaching those of a developed 
country. Our problem is the inadequate attention which we are 
paying, particularly to the poorest element in the country. That 
is a fundamental concern of the present and the next 
administration. It is not a matter of increasing resources now 
but rather using them more efficiently. It is a problem of 
management. To do that, we plan to move forward in a decisive 
way to decentralize the health system. Here we have to make very 
fundamental changes, but the idea of subsidizing demand instead 
of the supply of health services has turned out to be a failure 
throughout the world. It has increased the cost of providing 
health services in an impressive way. We can move forward in a 
way which will guarantee greater freedom of choice to the users 
of health services. However, we are absolutely against the 
simplistic formula of subsidizing the demand for health services 
which the right-wing candidacies of Alessandri and Pinera are 
proposing! 
  [Correa] You have not said where you would reduce public 
spending. 
  [Villarzu] There is rather little room for maneuver in 
reducing the budget. The most probable outcome is that we will 
have to achieve generalized savings in spending which would not 
affect salaries and allowances and, as far as possible, would 
not affect spending with a social impact. We may be able to 
lower spending on the purchase of goods and services and on some 
investment programs, by reducing the rate of project 
implementation. 
  [Correa] You have proposed replacing the complementary, 
overall tax with a tax on private spending. 
  [Villarzu] "In our program we point out that it would be 
appropriate, while respecting our commitment not to increase the 
tax burden, to change the tax system to make it into a more 
effective instrument to encourage savings, both by individuals 
as well as by companies. We are exploring the idea of a tax on 
spending which, theoretically, looks very attractive. However, 
it has proved to be very difficult to implement. It could 
stimulate tax evasion and a fall in tax collections. Rather than 
replacing the complementary, overall tax with a tax on general 
spending, we are thinking of some specific taxes." 
  And he added: "It is said that the public sector should 
spend 
less, which would make it possible for the Central Bank to lower 
the interest rate, because the increase in private spending 
which would occur in that case would be compensated for by less 
public spending. We have pointed out that, in effect, we could 
try to ensure that public spending would grow less and, since it 
is necessary for aggregate spending by the economy (total public 
spending plus private spending) to grow less, private spending 
would also have to grow less." 
  [Correa] To do this, would taxes go up? 
  [Villarzu] If we want to lower interest rates, the only way 
to do this would be by imposing a specific tax. For example, a 
tax on gasoline. It could also be done by increasing the VAT 
[Value Added Tax], but I do not like that kind of solution, 
since it has another kind of impact. 
  The fact is that what is collected under such a tax, which 
would be approved in the law, would involve an advance payment 
to the Central Bank. In that way the Central Bank would be in a 
position to lower the interest rate, which would be advantageous 
to the private sector and, in particular, to exporters. 
  [Correa] Increasing taxes? 
  [Villarzu] No. Our basic commitment is to maintain the 
present tax load. However, this transitional instrument could be 
necessary. A specific tax would favor the productive sectors of 
the country and will not be enacted if there is not a sufficient 
consensus in support of it. 
  [Correa] Will you be as tough as Buchi or as Foxley in not 
increasing expenditures in response to pressures from various 
sectors? 
  [Villarzu] I do not like to use the term "tough," but I can 
be tough when I have to be.

  [Text] The Radicals [Radical Civic Union, UCR] have 
released a document, worked out during a meeting lasting five 
hours to review the crisis in the provinces, which says that the 
current economic plan "has tremendously aggravated the trend 
that leaves the poor increasingly behind" and which asks the 
government to implement changes to achieve growth with social 
progress. 
  The document was the climax of the UCR leadership plenum 
meeting presided over by Raul Alfonsin. The UCR president 
listened to some 20 reports on the crisis in regional economies, 
and said: "An economic policy cannot succeed if it does not 
take the people into account." 
  The Radicals stressed that the economic program of the 
Carlos 
Menem government "has tremendously aggravated the trend that 
leaves the poor increasingly behind," considering that "an 
irresponsible confidence in the spontaneous workings of the free 
market has turned the opening up into a experimental balancing 
act conducted without a net and without any training." 
  The document says that the Argentine opening up has been "a 
shock" without "any reconversion program designed to orient and 
support productive activities." The document also says that the 
decline in basic economic activities and the crisis affecting 
provincial public administrations, which was aggravated by the 
transfer of services, "has produced an unprecedented 
deterioration in the population's health, education, and public 
security." 
  The document, entitled "The Chain Breaks at Its Weakest 
Points," recalls, and not without irony, that the year that is 
ending should have been the year marking "the beginning of the 
payment of the social debts," in accordance with government 
announcements within the framework of the Social Plan launched 
with a lot of noise at the beginning of 1993. "Instead, violent 
demonstrations have been what called our attention to the 
situation in the provinces," the document points out, referring 
to Santiago del Estero and La Rioja social outbursts. 
  More than 20 UCR provincial presidents spoke during the 
meeting. They progressively painted a map of the situation in 
the provinces, each with different specific characteristics, but 
which together described a crisis in the regional economies. 
  The assessment made by most speeches put the blame for the 
social chaos in the provinces not only on the economic 
adjustment being sponsored by the national government, but also 
on Justicialist Party administrations, many of them installed in 
the provinces since 1983. 
  Salta Province leaders Jose Napoleon Gambetta and Osvaldo 
Camisar said in their report that the policies implemented 
between 1983 and 1991 by two Justicialist administrations 
"accentuated the deterioration of the public administration, 
leaving it in a virtual state of bankruptcy." 
  Rio Negro Governor Horacio Massaccesi -- UCR first vice 
president -- presented a detailed and harsh report. The 
governor mentioned the contributions that Justicialist governors 
received during the 1993 electoral year, and noted the careless 
way in which many of them, who now suffer ruinous treasury 
situations, spent public funds. 
  Alfonsin spoke at the end of the meeting to stress that the 
party will not only criticize government policies, but UCR 
representatives will soon visit government offices to present 
alternative proposals to the economic plan in order to face the 
crisis afflicting the regional economies. 
  Former Mendoza Governor Jose Octavio Bordon could not escape 
the wave of criticism. Fernando Armeniague, UCR provincial 
president, recalled that former UCR Governor Felipe Llaver 
handed over a clean and ordered administration to Bordon, who is 
currently a Justicialist senator, while in a short period of 
time Bordon put the Bank of Mendoza in the red. 
  The head of the La Rioja UCR branch, Roberto Nieto Brizuela, 
spent time talking about the careless way former Governor Carlos 
Menem spend public funds during his administration, an attitude 
that is in sharp contrast with the president's current attitude 
of "adjustment policy without anesthesia." Brizuela outlined 
the way La Rioja was administered in the past, which would 
partly explain its present state of bankrupcy.

<F P=106> [Article by Jorge Grecco] </F>
  [Excerpts] The long-standing friendship between Vice 
Admiral Juan Carlos Anchezar, retired, and the Anzorregui family 
[Hugo Anzorregui is SIDE's secretary], and his excellent 
personal relationship with Eduardo Bauza [secretary general of 
the presidency], were instrumental in catapulting him into the 
Secretariat for State Intelligence (SIDE) as Anzorregui's 
second-in- command. 
  The incumbent Interior Ministry under secretary for 
intelligence is Police Superintendent Jose Roberto Scopa, 
retired, who will leave on 1 February. [passage omitted] 
  "Well what do you think of that, Jorge?" was what Vice Adm. 
Anchezar said to the brother of SIDE's secretary, Jorge 
Anzorregui, when he was offered Scopa's post. 
  Jorge Anzorregui, a criminal lawyer who goes about the 
corridors of the courthouse invariably greeting whomsoever he 
comes across, has been a friend of Vice Adm. Anchezar for some 
years now. Anzorregui advised him to accept his bother's offer. 
  SIDE's secretary met with the vice admiral in Punta del Este 
on 3 January. There, after coming to an agreement, the admiral 
accepted the offer. 
  The road traveled by the members of Argentina's intelligence 
service community is well known to Vice Adm. Anchezar, a Navy 
pilot who failed by an inch to be appointed chief of the Joint 
General Staff when Italo Luder was defense minister at the 
beginning of the Menem administration. Having been 
outmaneuvered by Admiral Emilio Osses in this endeavor, Vice 
Adm. Anchezar retired. In any case, he was awarded a 
consolation prize -- he was nominated director of State 
Shipyards and Naval Factories (AFNE). 
  Vice Adm. Anchezar had for several years held the post of 
deputy chief of the Navy Intelligence Department, located on the 
fifth floor of the Libertad building -- the Navy General Staff 
headquarters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Henrique </F>
Cardoso by Luiz Noronha and Rodolfo Fernandes at Cardoso's 
apartment in Brasilia; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso will 
return to Congress, at least during the month of January. He 
will practically move over there to personally promote the 
approval of the economic stabilization program by senators and 
deputies. 
  In an interview with O GLOBO, Cardoso says: On the day after 
the approval of a zero-deficit budget, we are going to create 
the URV [real value unit]. I am hoping to be able to do this by 
the end of January. 
  Cardoso is aware that in undertaking such a marathon effort 
he will have to have lunch and dinner more than twice a day and 
will have to attend dozens of meetings. But he is not concerned 
about this. Not even the recurrence of back pains provoked by 
an old hernia ailment -- which, by doctor's orders, sometimes 
forces him to lie down -- causes him to lose his good humor and 
enthusiasm. [passage omitted] 
  [O GLOBO] Congress will vote on the zero-deficit budget 
proposal, which is the pillar of the stabilization plan, at a 
time when a historic moralization campaign is being conducted 
within the Budget Committee. What effect could this have on the 
success of these measures? 
  [Cardoso] Had it not been for the crisis that erupted within 
the Budget Committee and for the CPI [Congressional 
Investigating Committee] that was subsequently created to 
investigate it, I would not have been able to revise the budget. 
Neither I nor the government would be able to make Congress 
discontinue its traditional habit of inflating the budget to the 
point of rendering the fight against inflation unfeasible. Had 
it not been for the crisis, we would have had no cards to play. 
  [O GLOBO] Who else is obstructing the plan in Congress? 
  [Cardoso] A group of deputies linked to municipal 
governments 
who believe the plan will be harmful to their municipalities. 
What motivates Congress more than the presidential succession, 
for example, is the election of each deputy. There is a group of 
municipalities, the poorest ones, that essentially depend on the 
Fund of Municipal Participation [in the national budget]. But we 
are negotiating it. One of the alternatives, suggested by Deputy 
Gonzaga Motta, is of liberating resources according to an idea 
inversely proportional to poverty. The poorer it is, the less 
resources it will hold in the fund. Another possibility: not 
touching the issue of municipalities to continue toward an 
alternative mechanism. What would it be? I suggested one: Today 
there is an income tax paid by public employees. That tax 
collected by the states should remain within the states; what is 
collected by the federal government will not be kept by the 
federal government but will be sent to the states and 
municipalities. It is just a matter of changing it. It 
represents approximately $1 billion. 
  [O GLOBO] And what is unnegotiable? 
  [Cardoso] Two things. The deficit must be zero. Today 
everyone already has adopted this idea. Point two: There is no 
way to end the mechanism of having a provisional fund within the 
Fund of Municipal Participation because the government would 
have no way of facing the essential issue, which is, for 
instance, that of paying for health, because it would have no 
funds earmarked for that. I must have 15 percent of the budget 
free in order to meet those expenditures. That is unremovable. 
But only the municipalities have resisted this idea. 
  [O GLOBO] Then once the budget and the constitutional 
amendment creating the Social Emergency Fund are approved, will 
the government immediately create the URV? 
  [Cardoso] Ah, it will be created the next day. But first 
there must be a decision by Congress so I will be certain I have 
a balanced budget and I will not need to resort to the banking 
system to ask for money. I hope to be able to do it by the end 
of January. The URV's creation is a simple thing. What is 
difficult will be implementing it. I believe society already is 
expecting it. Everyone is anxious to see the URV. [passage 
omitted] 
  [O GLOBO] Does your position as a potential candidate for 
president of the Republic, which is taken independently from 
your will, upset the economic program? 
  [Cardoso] Here there is a paradox: To implement that plan I 
need a certain political leadership; but if you have that 
leadership people will automatically say you are a candidate. 
Then it does disturb. But at the same time it helps because 
people realize that I have a stable relationship with the 
president of the Republic, that I am capable of negotiating with 
Congress, that I do not run away from debate with anyone. 
  [O GLOBO] People want to hear a statement from you that you 
are not a candidate. 
  [Cardoso] It is not a matter of making a statement. I am not 
taking any personal steps for a candidacy, nor am I organizing 
an economic policy based on a candidacy. I have never accepted 
the condition of a candidate, not even within my party, the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. It is a rather hasty 
decision to believe that in Brazil someone who is finance 
minister can be a candidate for president. First, because the 
minister experiences great pressure. He must say no all the 
time, and this makes him very unpopular. There is also a public 
responsibility: Can I give up the ship now? I am not saying I 
will not be a candidate because I can be a candidate for 
senator. My political rights already have been lifted once; I do 
not wish it a second time. There is no sense in someone keeping 
me away from the political game. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] We would like to reiterate that Blas N. Riquelme 
resigned today as president of the Colorado Party. The 
controversy between Riquelme and President Juan Carlos Wasmosy 
came to a conclusion today when the controversial politician and 
brewery owner resigned. 
  Riquelme's resignation was reported at the headquarters of 
the Colorado Party by Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, first vice 
president of the Colorado Party Executive Board, to whom 
Riquelme conveyed his decision to resign after a telephone 
conversation they held this morning. 
  According to the statutes of the Colorado Party, Sanabria 
Cantero automatically becomes the acting president of the 
Colorado Party. The party's executive board is holding a 
closed-door meeting to evaluate Riquelme's situation regarding 
his controversy with President Wasmosy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Valdes] What do you think of the resignation of

  [Wasmosy] Well, it is a political problem. It was resolved 
by the Colorado Party Executive Board. I think the problem was 
resolved at that level. 
  [Valdes] Do you feel strengthened now? 
  [Wasmosy] I have always felt strong. I have never felt weak. 
  But I have not always had the support of the Colorado Party 
Executive Board. 
  Well, but you know very well that I was elected president of 
the Republic even without his support. 
  [Valdes] Will there be changes in your cabinet? 
  [Wasmosy] Negative. 
  [Valdes] Will Eugenio Sanabria Cantero remain as head of the 
National Navigation and Ports Administration? 
  [Wasmosy] Yes, of course, provided that his current 
functions 
do not prevent him from acting as head of the Colorado Party 
Executive Board, which is what I think our country needs. 
  [Valdes] Will there be a change at the Interior Ministry? 
  [Wasmosy] No. Absolutely not. 
  [Valdes] If Sanabria Cantero's political activities prevent 
him from performing his role normally, will he be changed? 
  [Wasmosy] You are speculating. I am not saying that. 
  [Valdes] But according to your remarks... 
  [Wasmosy] No. I said that I think that he will be able to 
remain in his post and at the same time be the chairman of the 
party board. Why not? 
  [Valdes] Are you satisfied with his being chairman of the 
party board? 
  [Wasmosy] I respect the party statutes. When the president 
resigns, the vice president takes over. 
  [Valdes] There are speculations that you will reportedly 
hold 
a meeting with Argana in Punta del Este. 
  [Wasmosy] They are speculations. 
  [Valdes] Is there anything to them? 
  [Wasmosy] Absolutely not. Is he here? I have never met him. 
  [Valdes] It is said that you did see him at the Centenario 
Club, and that you turned around so as not to greet him on the 
day of voting at the club. 
  [Wasmosy] I swear that I did not see him. 
  [Valdes] It is said that the party problem was just a 
smokescreen to conceal the utility rates increase. 
  [Wasmosy] That is absolutely false. 
  [Valdes] It is appropriate to mention that the Paraguayan 
president arrived yesterday in Punta del Este, where he will 
stay until tomorrow. In the afternoon he held a meeting with 
his counterparts Luis Alberto Lacalle (of Uruguay) and Carlos 
Saul Menem (of Argentina) at the farm of businessman Samuel 
Lieberman in Maldonado.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Finance Minister Crispiniano </F>
Sandoval by unidentified reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [ABC COLOR] We are only 15 days away from decisive 
political and technical Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
meetings. How do you view Mercosur's immediate future? Will it 
be a free-trade zone, a united customs system, or a common 
market? 
  [Sandoval] About Mercosur's immediate future: Officially, 
the schedule established at Las Lenas is being fulfilled. That 
schedule established the creation of a common market as of 1 
January 1995. However, the decisive item in the creation of a 
common market, the establishment of a common external duty 
system, has been delayed. 
  According to a decision made during the 28 December 1992 
presidential meeting in Montevideo, the common external duty 
system will have levels between zero and 20 percent, although "a 
reduced list of products will have different rates, which will 
reach up to 35 percent, with the understanding that this special 
rate will be reduced to a maximum of 20 percent over a period no 
longer than six years beginning on 1 January 1995." 
  On the other hand, the Asuncion Treaty gives Paraguay and 
Uruguay one year, or until 1 January 1995, for the total 
elimination of the list of exceptions that is included in the 
remaining 20 percent of that list. 
  We can infer from all I said above that if products and 
duties in the reduced list mentioned in the 28 December 1992 
presidents declaration are not many, we will have a "limited 
customs union" on 1 January 1995. 
  [ABC COLOR] Considering the difficulties encountered among 
member countries during the negotiating process, what are 
Brazil's proposals for breaking the deadlock and establishing a 
common external duty system for products called sensitive, such 
as capital goods, pharmaceutical chemistry [quimica fina], 
computers, etc.? Will the date for the establishment of an 
extended market, which was set for 1 January 1995, be delayed if 
it is not possible to find common ground for an agreement? 
  [Sandoval] According to what was said in the last economy 
vice ministers' meeting in Montevideo on 12 November 1993, as 
well as during the previous meetings of the technical subgroup 
10 (to coordinate macroeconomic policies), the Brazilian 
position on one hand, and the Argentine, Paraguayan, and 
Uruguayan positions on the other, are irreducible when referring 
to products such as capital goods, computers, and pharmaceutical 
chemistry. Brazil wants to protect its industries in these 
areas, while Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay need to equip 
themselves, want the freedom to freely chose technologically 
advanced products from third countries at a reasonable price, 
and do not want to be forced to purchase Brazilian machinery 
which is competitive simply because of the zero duty between 
Mercosur countries. 
  Brazil has made a concrete proposal. They proposed applying 
a 35 percent duty on these products at first, then lowering the 
rate gradually until it reaches 20 percent in six years starting 
in 1995. But this position was categorically rejected by 
Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Evidently this is a very 
difficult point because it not only deals with a difference in 
criteria on duties, but also affects the macroeconomic policies 
of these countries. The media has reported two bilateral 
meetings between Argentina and Brazil at the level of the 
economy vice ministers and economy ministers during December, to 
discuss these points. Paraguay and Uruguay were excluded from 
those meetings. Decisions in Mercosur must consented to by the 
four member countries. We can assure you that Paraguay will not 
yield its position of demanding reduced duties for these 
products. 
  There is no doubt that a stalemate on this point will be an 
obstacle for the establishment of the Mercosur as of 1 January 
1995. But it is better to wait and see. 
  [ABC COLOR] The schedule for the gradual elimination of 
tariffs has been strictly fulfilled. But very little progress 
has been made in the area of coordinating macroeconomic 
policies. We can almost say that talks on this matter are 
stalemated. What is being done to correct the asymmetries 
regarding trade, foreign exchange, tariffs, and even some 
protectionism that is still noticeable in the national economic 
structures of member countries? 
  [Sandoval] Here we must say that Brazil is the member 
country 
that must correct its economic policy in order to move its 
position closer to that of the other countries. According to 
macroeconomic indicators such as inflation rate, devaluation, 
fiscal balance, and custom tariffs, there is a great difference 
between Brazil and the other three member countries. The 
indicators mentioned above are not too different in Argentina, 
Paraguay, and Uruguay, and the gap can, therefore, be closed. 
But Brazil, with a 30 percent monthly inflation rate, 
correlative devaluations, and protectionist tariff policies in 
general, is too far out and will have difficulties in closing 
the gap. This country must establish the mechanisms to 
substantially reduce those rates. No one can ask the other 
three countries to increase their indicators disproportionately. 
  Uruguay's case is somewhat different because, although it 
does not have an incredibly high inflation rate nor devaluations 
(between 30 and 60 percent per year), its indicators do not 
match those of Argentina and Paraguay, but there are greater 
possibilities of adjusting them. This issue, obviously, is 
Mercosur's "Achilles tendon" because the respective economic 
plans are subject to the domestic policies, and in order to 
become attuned with other countries it is necessary to make 
changes which in some cases may represent great detours from the 
chosen path. 
  But we must also bear in mind that there is still a year 
ahead of us before Mercosur is implemented, and that the 
Brazilian delegations, during the economy ministers' meeting 
held in Asuncion on 1 July 1993, made a proposal to study the 
possibility of a maximum exchange rate band for the real 
exchange rate. This proposal is being assessed by the working 
subgroups. 
  [ABC COLOR] In the case of a possible link with NAFTA, what 
do you think Brazil will do if it has to choose between NAFTA 
and Mercosur? 
  [Sandoval] Although the Asuncion Treaty does not 
specifically 
mention the linking of member countries with other economic 
blocs, with the exception of ALADI [Latin American Integration 
Association], it can be deduced from what is established in 
Article 8 that any advantage granted to a member country is 
extended to the other Mercosur members. Therefore, Brazil or 
any other Mercosur member country's link with NAFTA would 
automatically mean the link of the entire group with the NAFTA 
bloc. 
  Another possibility is that Brazil leave Mercosur, as 
established in Articles 21 and 22, to independently join NAFTA. 
We do not believe this will happen because it was precisely 
Brazil and Argentina that promoted Mercosur. Moreover, in the 
hypothetical case that it has to choose between Mercosur and 
NAFTA, we believe that Brazil as the country with greater 
economic development in the region will be more interested in 
Mercosur for competitiveness and leadership reasons.

  [Text] Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy yesterday 
did not rule out the possibility that Paraguay might request 
indemnification or compensation from Argentina for the damage 
caused to our country as a consequence of the diversion of the 
Pilcomayo River. That is what he said at the end of the lunch 
he held with his Argentine and Uruguayan counterparts Carlos 
Saul Menem and Luis Alberto Lacalle at the Charrua Hill farm 
belonging to Samuel Liberman. 
  For more than three hours the three presidents met with 
businessmen, industrialists, and some press barons. Although 
Wasmosy at first said that bilateral issues or those related to 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] were not treated, he later 
explained that he talked with Menem on aspects related to the 
Pilcomayo River. 
  "We are going to discuss that matter with Menem on 14 
January 
when the Mitre Canal dredging begins. This is part of the 
riverways and Mercosur projects," he said. 
  He added that he told Menem and Maria Julia Alsogaray 
[natural resources and environment secretary] that in Buenos 
Aires they will talk thoroughly about the Pilcomayo River, when 
Public Works Minister Engineer Carlos Vacetti and engineer Luis 
Alberto Meyer, director of the National Pilcomayo River 
Commission, will also be present. 
  Asked whether during the dialogue on the Pilcomayo River 
they 
discussed the infrastructure that will reportedly be built to 
take advantage of the river's low waters, he said: "This 
problem does not affect Paraguay and Argentina alone. It also 
affects Bolivia, and after all it is also an ecological problem 
which needs very special attention." 
  The Paraguayan president did not rule out the possibility of 
demanding compensation from Argentina for the damage caused by 
the diversion of the Pilcomayo River. He thus said that he will 
first try to solve the problem, and then seek the 
indemnification or some arrangement that could be achieved on 
the matter. 
  Wasmosy was also consulted on whether they discussed the 
automatic lifting of tariffs that will be in effect among 
Mercosur countries, and he said that it is a subject that has a 
process to follow. He explained that the policy on this matter 
is based on achieving coordination of macroeconomic policies 
among Mercosur countries, because otherwise the issue will be 
delayed even more. 
  Asked again why Paraguay did not submit in time the official 
lists of products that would be exempted from taxes, he said: 
"It is not true that we did not submit in time the lists of our 
products, but the integration treaties will be signed and 
fulfilled only if they bring more bread, happiness, and 
well-being to the inhabitants of the country." 
  The president added that the presidents of Bolivia and Chile 
were invited to the meeting with the Mercosur presidents to be 
held in Colonia (Uruguay), but he declined to name the 
fundamental topics that will be discussed at that summit.

  [Excerpts] President Alberto Fujimori revealed today that 
Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen's upcoming visit to Peru 
has been postponed until further notice. The head of state also 
referred to other issues during the various activities he 
carried out at the settlement of Huaycan. [passage omitted] 
  Shortly before concluding his tour, he briefly inspected the 
site where the local technological institute is being built. In 
his statements to the media Fujimori ruled out the possibility 
that Ecuadoran President Duran-Ballen's visit to our capital 
will take place on 20 January. 
  [Begin Fujimori recording] The date has not been officially 
coordinated at the Foreign Ministry level. In any case, it will 
not occur on 20 January -- but we are waiting for our Foreign 
Ministry to establish the most appropriate date. We are 
obviously waiting for this expectantly, to welcome the president 
of our brother country Ecuador with open arms, as he deserves.

<F P=106> [Interview with Carlos Tapia, an "expert" on subversive </F>
affairs, by Victor Andres Ponce; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Ponce] How do you view the subversive phenomenon at 
the end of 1993? 
  [Tapia] It is no secret that the MRTA [Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement] has been defeated and those who are left 
of its militants are engaged in abduction and looting. The 
truth is that they were defeated late in 1991, when columns 
headed by Serpa Cartolini and Sistero Garcia clashed in San 
Martin. This confrontation reflected the rapid decay of this 
subversive movement. 
  [Ponce] Are there no more MRTA columns or grassroots groups 
in the interior? 
  [Tapia] The MRTA has been completely annihilated. Most of 
the recently repented terrorists belong to this group. 
  [Ponce] What about the Shining Path [SL]? 
  [Tapia] The SL has an active column in Huancabamba which is 
linked to the Jaen Province in Cajamarca; the column in Mariscal 
Luzuriaga Province, Ancash, operates in Huanuco; and there is 
another active column in Chalhuanca, Apurimac. 
  [Ponce] How about Huallaga? 
  [Tapia] In that zone there must be approximately 500 men of 
what they call their main force and their local force. These 
individuals are fulling engaged in drug trafficking. The 
Huallaga SL regional committee broke away from the SL leadership 
in February 1990, when [Abimael] Guzman was still free. Imagine 
now that their leader is behind bars. It is more than likely 
that the remaining SL members throughout the country receive no 
economic aid from this zone. 
  [Ponce] How about Lima? 
  [Tapia] The SL has four very important armed detachments 
deployed in various parts of the city. One of them recently 
held up a bank branch in El Agustino. 
  [Ponce] Now that Guzman is in prison and they do not have 
the 
economic support from the Alto Huallaga drug trafficking, has 
the SL managed to organize another political-military unit? 
  [Tapia] The most difficult time for the SL seems to have 
been 
between September and December 1992, after Guzman was arrested. 
The SL Central Committee held its first meeting in February 
1993 and managed to get reorganized in May. 
  [Ponce] Was this under the leadership of Oscar Ramirez 
Durand 
(Feliciano)? 
  [Tapia] Yes, it is unlikely that their hierarchy has varied, 
more so because Feliciano has been the third or fourth most 
important member since 1980. Oscar Ramirez Durand participated 
in the Chuschi School, in the 1988 Congress, and was elected to 
the Central Committee. 
  [Ponce] Are there any signs of a reaction by the SL to 
Guzman's request for a peace agreement? 
  [Tapia] Fujimori read the letter before the United Nations 
on 
1 October, an important day for the SL because it is the 
anniversary of the Chinese revolution. On 7 October, the SL 
Central Committee issued a communique reporting a government 
trick. Following these developments important changes took 
place at the SL grassroots level, although they were not 
consistent -- one must bear in mind the hold up in El Agustino. 
The best evidence of these changes is the pronouncement of the 
Canto Grande inmates in favor of the agreement. These sectors 
accept a single leader and talk about a change of times for the 
SL. The SL representatives abroad also reveal a change of 
stance... 
  [Ponce] But Arce Borja and Olaechea have emphatically 
reported this trick... 
  [Tapia] Their pronouncement is unimportant. It should be 
recalled that neither of them belonged to the SL Central 
Committee. The most authorized voices abroad are the relatives 
of Augusta La Torre, Guzman's late wife. These relatives, who 
are in Stockholm or Switzerland, have stated that one SL period 
has ended and a new period has started. But it should be noted 
that there is a sector that has still not clearly stated its 
position. 
  [Ponce] Why do you maintain that negotiations between the 
government and Guzman continue? 
  [Tapia] The negotiations started last February and are about 
to end. What other explanation is there for transferring Martha 
Huatay from Yanamayo or for summoning Osman Morote. 
Negotiations cannot be based on Guzman's imprisonment terms 
because this is handled by the International Red Cross... 
  [Ponce] What other things do you think are being negotiated. 
What is Guzman's plan? 
  [Tapia] What do they mean when they say that a new phase is 
beginning in the party? I always remember him saying: "We were 
never defeated by the police, why should we be defeated in war." 
And, precisely, before starting its war, the SL was a political 
organization that controlled all sorts of social sectors in 
Ayacucho, including universities, neighborhood associations, 
peasants federations, and the Chamber of Commerce. An 
alternative with this background, that engaged in war, may 
emerge to... 
  [Ponce] To become an electoral alternative? 
  [Tapia] I do not think that is feasible because the SL 
continues to be a totalitarian alternative. If SL militants 
give up war, they will not do so out of political conviction, 
but rather because of their submission to the leadership of 
"their president." If they were to decide to become an electoral 
alternative, that would mean Guzman would cease to be their 
leader. Yet it is quite likely he will continue to lead his 
party from prison. Nobody can imagine Abimael speaking over 
television and trying to convince electors. He has always done 
politics as he is doing now in his cell: Imprisoned, watching 
television, with a communication channel carrying his message to 
the militants. 
  [Ponce] Are you telling me the SL will become a striking 
force [fuerza de choque] within labor unions and social groups... 
  [Tapia] That is so. 
  [Ponce] But what evidence is there that the SL's new phase 
is 
heading in that direction? 
  [Tapia] The SL's new language in the neighborhoods is 
against 
actions to obtain electoral gains, against traditional political 
parties, in favor of the peoples' claims, and is antirevisionist 
(against the legal leftist sector in the neighborhoods)... 
  [Ponce] Does this new language follows Guzman's orders from 
prison? 
  [Tapia] Obviously. We will, therefore, face a striking force 
within the peoples' movements. Another thing to remember is 
that a force of this kind may establish alliances with the most 
obscure sectors of the country.

  [Text] Commenting on President Alberto Fujimori's calls for 
national dialogue, Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont has said that all 
talks intended to revive the country's economy would be 
positive. He also said that he will submit to Congress a bill on 
the basic municipalities law in order to give them more autonomy. 
  [Begin Belmont recording] Mayors have the right to submit 
proposals. We are proposing a much more modern and more 
expeditious basic law to grant local governments what they have 
been wanting for years: an opportunity to depoliticize their 
actions and assume more executive powers, implementing public 
works programs with their properties and income to benefit 
neighborhoods. 
  I think that, as the government stated, anything that favors 
national consensus, such as the government proposal, is an 
excellent idea, because Peru needs to focus on those things that 
unite it, not on the few things that divide it. [end recording]

  [Text] The Disciplinary Board of Magistrates on 27 December 
1993 named 14 full members of the Supreme Court and four supreme 
prosecutors. 
  The designations were made under the terms of Article 2 of 
the constitutional law dated 17 December 1993, which empowers 
the Disciplinary Board of Magistrates to designate and evaluate 
Supreme Court members and prosecutors. 
  The whereas clauses of Court Resolutions Nos. 1 and 2 
establish that the Disciplinary Board of Magistrates has 
conscientiously chosen the best qualified-magistrates for the 
posts. 
  The designated Supreme Court full members are: Luis Almenara 
Bryson, Jorge Buendia Gutierrez, Andres Echevarria Adrianzen, 
Carlos Giusti Acuna, Pedro Iberico Mas, Elmer Lozada Peralta, 
Emilio Montes de Oca Peralta, Luis Ortiz Bernardini, Nelson 
Reyes Rios, Javier Roman Santisteban, Lino Roncalla Valdivia, 
Manuel Sanchez Palacios Paiva, Hugo Sivina Hurtado, and Elcira 
Vasquez Cortez. 
  The designated supreme prosecutors are Miguel Aljovin 
Swayne, 
Ana Nelly Calderon Navarro, Blanca Nelida Colan Maguino, and 
Pedro Pablo Gutierrez Ferreyra. 
  The two resolutions established that the Disciplinary Board 
of Magistrates will issue, on behalf of the nation, the 
certificates to the designated Supreme Court members. 
  Thanks to the constitutional law promulgated on 16 December 
1993, the Disciplinary Board of Magistrates' functions were 
expanded to include the designation of members of the National 
Council of Magistrates, which is an institution that designates 
and evaluates Peruvian judges, except for justices of the peace, 
who are selected in elections by the people, as is set forth by 
the Constitution approved in the referendum on 31 October 1993.

  [Text] Havana, 8 Jan (AFP) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro 
was absent from the ceremony organized Saturday in the capital 
to commemorate the 35th anniversary of his triumphant entrance 
into Havana. 
  Thousands of persons participated in the ceremony, including 
several members of the Cuban leadership, with the obvious 
exception of Fidel and his brother, Raul Castro, who is the 
first vice president of the Council of Ministers and Minister of 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba (FAR). 
  Such absences, particularly that of the chief of state, 
caused surprise. Especially when some of Fidel Castro's 
bodyguards were seen taking up positions in Ciudad Libertad, 
formerly Columbia camp, which was the general headquarters of 
the troops of Dictator Fulgencio Batista, who was defeated by 
the Castroite guerrillas on 1 January 1959. 
  The media and government have thus far refrained from 
explaining the absence. Some observers attributed it to the 
fact that Castro delivered a speech last 1 January in Santiago 
de Cuba (east) commemorating the revolutionary triumph. 
  On that occasion Castro reiterated his willingness to keep 
Cuba on the socialist path and expressed his confidence for 1994 
following the "most difficult year" ever experienced by the 
regime since its emergence. 
  The Cuban revolution celebrates 1 January as the day when 
Cubans began the year 1959 without Batista, who fled on 31 
December for Santo Domingo. The guerrilla columns entered 
Havana and Santiago the following day, 2 January, after the last 
cells of military resistance surrendered. 
  Only Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union of Communist 
Youths (UJC), spoke at the commemorative ceremony and insisted 
on persevering in the socialist path. 
  Over the past few days Castro's epic event has been widely 
commented on by the press, which has insistently cited a phrase 
by the Cuban leader that is currently applicable: "Let's not 
fool ourselves into thinking that everything will be easier from 
now on. Perhaps everything will be more difficult."

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the FAR 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces], yesterday continued an extensive 
tour of the territory defended by the Western Army. Castro, who 
is also second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, was 
accompanied by Division General Leopoldo Cintra Frias and 
Candido Palmero -- both Politburo members -- as well as by other 
high-ranking officials and political leaders. 
  Raul visited Unit 4261, where he congratulated unit 
personnel 
for their decisive contribution to defeating the illegal 
television broadcasts from Miami. He stressed the fact that he 
had devoted the first visit of the year to this unit because it 
is the best of its kind in the FAR. 
  At Unit 2100, Castro received a detailed explanation of the 
unit's characteristics and operations, as well as the progress 
of the fortifications. 
  It has also been learned that the tour of the civil defense 
tunnels in San Jose de las Lajas provided deep satisfaction to 
Raul and those accompanying him, given the magnificent job that 
has been done there. During a conversation in one of the 
classrooms there, the FAR minister expressed his conviction that 
the new generations will be able to continue moving forward. 
  Castro was also avised on the combat readiness of Unit 6100. 
Castro asked about the agricultural-livestock plans for the 
current year and insisted that an increase in production must be 
accompanied by a decrease in the unit cost of items. 
  Lastly, Raul visited an installation being built by the Blas 
Roca Contingent. The installation is earmarked for the 
production of 90 tons per year of a variety of kelp 
[espirulina], a high-priced protein on the international market. 
  [Havana Radio Progreso Network in Spanish at 1200 GMT on 7 
January, in a similar report on Castro's tour of Western Army 
territory, adds: "For his part, Colonel (Perez Pileta), chief of 
Unit 6100, briefed the minister on the combat readiness of his 
mechanized infantry brigade, as well as on the agricultural- 
livestock plans for the current year, and insisted that an 
increase in production must be accompanied by a decrease in the 
cost per unit. In this connection, Raul Castro stressed that our 
military chiefs must have a good grasp of economic data, from 
how much it costs to produce a single boniato to how much a 
rifle bullet costs. The tour's heavy schedule did not prevent 
Castro from reiterating a great interest in increasing 
fish-farming production or from visiting the Western Army's fry 
production center. This center is being built with the 
collaboration of the Ministry of the Fishing Industry."]

  [Text] Shortly before leaving on a tour that will take him 
to several African countries, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
stated that the Cuban delegation will explain the reality of 
today's Cuba. 
  The foreign minister held a news conference, during which he 
broached diverse international relations subjects, emphasizing 
his tour of Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia. 
Robaina said he is going to update the foreign ministers of 
those countries on how things are in Cuba, but will also meet 
with the ministers of health, tourism, education, and others. He 
will be received by the presidents of the nations visited. 
  Regarding the internal situation in Angola, Robaina said 
that 
Cuba and Angola maintain excellent relations, which are 
experiencing a period of mutual understanding. With regard to 
relations with Chile, the foreign minister said they will be 
reestablished at the moment the Chileans consider most opportune. 
  On Cuba's relations with the United States, Robaina stated 
that while the United States' language may be less aggressive; 
the blockade has intensified. 
  [Havana Radio Progreso in Spanish at 1200 GMT on 7 January, 
in a similar report, adds: "Robaina announced: `We are obliged 
to go through Switzerland, so we have to take advantage of 
that'. There too, meetings at the Foreign Ministry are planned... 
  "The Cuban foreign minister mentioned the existence of new 
prospects for the political and economic ties between our 
country and Europe. As to the conflict in the state of Chiapas, 
he said he hoped the Mexicans would be able to find the best 
solution. Lastly, Robaina said that Cuba's situation is very 
difficult, but that we are not in a dead-end alley. Although 
1994 will not be greatly different from 1993, the spiral will 
begin moving upwards."]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina was interviewed by 
Radio Rebelde reporter Roberto Gili last night at the Jose Marti 
International Airport, shortly before leaving on his tour of 
Europe and Africa. Robaina told Gili that: 
  [Begin Robaina recording] I am going as a guest of several 
foreign ministries, in this case the foreign ministries of five 
countries located on a continent with which we have, 
historically, maintained special relations. You are aware of the 
offensive the country, and the Foreign Ministry in particular, 
has launched in areas like the Caribbean, Latin America, and 
other areas of the world. In this particular case, we will be 
touring Ghana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Angola, and Namibia. In Angola, 
as in the other countries, we have always been in contact with 
our counterparts. The health, commerce, economy, and tourism 
ministers have also been in close contact with their 
counterparts in those countries. We are pleased to announce that 
on this trip we will be meeting with the presidents of the five 
countries. 
  I believe that Europe and other countries of the world are 
being manipulated by a one-sided version of the news regarding 
our country which is handled by a manipulated press. This 
country is not the hell many reporters paint it to be nor is it 
the paradise others paint it to be. We must exploit the means to 
tell those countries what our country is all about. 
Unfortunately, when we tell the big newspapers what the 
situation is, they do not always print what we tell them. The 
offensive involves, above all, explaining our truth to Europe. 
Our truth has good, average, and bad things to it, but we must 
have a chance to explain it. For example, I believe that the 
recently concluded meeting with the European Parliament opened a 
space for this communication. We agree on some issues and 
disagree on others; but the idea is not whether we agree or 
disagree; the idea is to keep communication channels open. I 
believe that communication with Europe is indispensable to this 
offensive. 
  In the economic area I believe there are already some 
European countries that have an important presence in our 
country. Many have an opinion about Cuba, many express opinions 
about Cuba, but not many have direct contact with Cuba or 
express their views on Cuba. I am not asking that they share our 
views or that they share the views of others; all I ask is that 
they analyze our situation and that we be heard before a 
decision is made about us. We do not like it when others talk 
about us and we are not allowed to tell our side. That is what I 
am talking about. Our side must be heard. Unfortunately, those 
who oppose us have much more space than our Revolution has. [end

Cuban official sources have reported that Robaina has stopped 
over in Berne on his way to Africa and will take advantage of 
this stopover to meet with Swiss authorities and visit the 
capital city, particularly the Parliament. Robaina will leave 
Berne on Sunday. This is the second time Robaina has visited 
Switzerland; his first visit was in 1993 when he addressed the 
Social and Economic Council to explain the Cuban situation. At 
that time Robaina also met with Swiss authorities, UN officials 
in Geneva, Latin American ambassadors, and other ambassadors to

  [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1255 GMT on 8 January features a 13-minute live telephone 
interview with Marilyn Perez Coto, journalist for the Puerto 
Rican newspaper CLARIDAD, regarding the current situation of the 
35 Cuban athletes who deserted recently during the 17th Central 
American and Caribbean Games in Ponce. 
  Radio Rebelde host Alfredo Forte explains to Perez that this 
call is in response to a 7 January GRANMA article that was based 
on the Milvia Arcilla piece published in CLARIDAD entitled, "The 
Defectors are Abandoned." Perez states: "Sadly enough, many of 
the athletes who defected believed the promises made to them. 
However a week after the games, they were housed in a civil 
defense shelter." Perez states that many of the promises made to 
them cannot be fulfilled because of certain Puerto Rican laws 
and regulations. She adds: "It is not easy for someone new to 
find work, particularly when there are so many unemployed Puerto 
Ricans with university degrees in sports." 
  Perez stresses that athletes in Puerto Rico need to depend 
on 
regular jobs to make a living and that training facilities are 
not as readily available as in Cuba. Perez stresses that the 
athletes have basically been forbidden to speak to the press, 
particularly CLARIDAD, which presents a point of view different 
from the official view in other newspapers. 
  Perez points out that only one athlete, basketball star 
Andre 
Gibert, has been provided an apartment. Perez states that they 
have been told Gibert is very depressed because he is not 
playing and that his future is uncertain, since it is unlikely 
that the Puerto Rican and Cuban Basketball Leagues will reach an 
agreement to let him play. Forte and Perez stress that Gibert 
had been told it was very easy to become a pro star. 
  Perez explains that the Cuban exile community is pressuring 
sports leagues and local officials, behind closed doors, to 
change the rules and let Cuban athletes play. Perez notes that 
the possibilities for these athletes are minimal: "It is very 
sad, but these young men [muchachos] have thrown their futures 
overboard. Here they will end up working as store clerks." 
Throughout the conversation, Perez repeatedly refers to the 
athletes as "muchachos." 
  Forte states that they have unfortunately allowed themselves 
to be carried away by a siren's song and are now dearly paying 
the consequences. 
  Perez reports that there are approximately 10 athletes still 
in Puerto Rico -- the ones who ended up in the shelter. Others 
have reportedly moved to Miami or are staying with relatives. 
Perez stresses that in Miami the situation is no easier in terms 
of getting permission from sports leagues or overcoming 
international rules. 
  Perez adds: "It is very, very sad. There are people here who 
left during the Mariel boat lift; we all know the conditions 
under which the Mariel people left. We see them in the streets, 
very depressed and regretful. They are trying to get help, and 
tell everyone that they regret having left and want to return to 
Cuba. However, we cannot help them at this point." Perez adds 
that there are immigrants from the seventies and eighties who 
are truly sad and have not found a niche in Puerto Rico. Perez 
says that the only hope these people have is to fight for the 
end of the blockade and therefore vindicate themselves. Yet, it 
is not easy to do this after having betrayed one's country. She 
states: "They mope around like penitent souls. It is truly sad." 
  Perez describes the tragedy of these young men's actions, 
that this will be a trauma they will have to shoulder the rest 
of their lives, and adds: "In the end, they will regret what 
they did." 
  Forte thanks Perez for the information. Perez explains that 
they feel like Cuba'a correspondents. Forte thanks Perez for the 
support CLARIDAD and the Puerto Rican people gave to Cuba during 
the games. Perez says that it is their duty to support Cuba 100 
percent, everyday, and under any circumstances, because: "We 
believe in the Cuban Revolution."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1700 GMT on 7 January devotes its 15-minute "Straight Talk" 
program to highlighting what program guest Luis Sexto, a BOHEMIA 
journalist, describes as the first potential problem of which he 
has heard in connection with the functioning of the new Basic 
Cooperative Production Units [UPBC]. 
  Program host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia notes that Sexto gets 
letters from people at both Radio Rebelde and BOHEMIA, and that 
certain subjects, such as today's, are too important not to 
address. 
  Sexto says: "I have just received a letter signed by Dr. 
Rafael Gonzalez, a veterinarian from Sancti Spiritus Province. 
This is an excessively respectful letter -- if the adverb 
`excessively' can ever be fitting in describing the respect one 
feels toward, or shows, others! It is a letter in which, 
although he does have a personal problem, what most concerns him 
is the problem in general; that is, how such a problem could 
affect the nation. Briefly, the case is as follows: Dr. Gonzalez 
was the veterinarian at a state agricultural-livestock 
enterprise. He does not say whether it was a place that raised 
cattle, or one that grew cane, or a miscellaneous crop 
enterprise. In any case, the farm where he used to work became a 
UBPC [Basic Cooperative Production Unit]. So he agreed to become 
a member of that UBPC; and when the farm formally turned into a 
UBPC, he was told that the only thing he could do there was be 
an agricultural laborer, that there was no place there for a 
veterinarian. 
  "He, of course, refused -- for reasons everyone understood 
but no one did anything about. Moreover, he argues that he also 
has physical handicaps that prevent him from, that constitute 
obstacles to, working in the fields, since agricultural work is 
so tough. 
  "He writes me because he has visited many people, and the 
Sancti Spiritus labor agency told him it had no work for him. 
The Institute of Veterinary Medicine here in Havana told him 
that that's the way it is, [repeats] that that is just the way 
it is. The legal directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture also 
told him that that is just the way it is. And he, who says he is 
a revolutionary, a 36- year-old veterinarian trained by the 
Revolution, is not complaining. He is not cursing, or recanting, 
or regretting anything, or making any reproaches. Although he is 
having this personal problem, he simply says that he is worried 
about there existing, in the UBPC's, a tendency to do without 
professionals in the work force." 
  Sexto continues: "He says that much good has been spoken 
about the UBPC's; that he has heard many good things about the 
UBPC's -- even referring to a recent article of mine on the 
UBPC's that appeared in BOHEMIA -- but that he has heard nothing 
negative about the UBPC's anywhere, nothing negative that can be 
foreseen about the UBPC's. And he thinks that what is happening 
to him might also be happening to other people, and that that 
could be a negative aspect of the UBPC's that we must intercept, 
watch out for, follow." 
  Roque and Sexto then explain what the UPBCs are and why they 
came to be. 
  Sexto says: "The fact is that Dr. Gonzalez is worried that 
doing without professionals in the work force in the UBPC's 
could be a negative tendency of this formula for agricultural 
organization, of this new relationship between the man and the 
land -- a tendency which might obstruct, or prevent, the UBPCs' 
developing to their full potential. I think he is right. 
Unquestionably, no one can achieve profitability, or become 
efficient in production, without science or technology...nor can 
anyone defend the UBPCs' doing without, or attempting to do 
without them. That could be a negative tendency, which must 
constantly be watched for, put a stop to, and controlled." 
  Roque notes that "the objective is to achieve direct 
production -- not to have a lot of people in offices, too many 
people affecting the profitability of a UBPC, of course." 
  Sexto agrees, noting that "agriculture with good yields, 
good 
results, that is profitable, that is productive, cannot be 
achieved through man's labor alone. That is clear. And I think 
that Dr. Gonzalez is very right to worry about what is worrying 
him. And I think maybe no one in the country has thought that 
this might happen, that the UBPC's might have a tendency to try 
to do without professionals on their work force." 
  "Of course he does not explain to me what kind of an 
enterprise this was, whether or not it was a cattle-raising 
enterprise. There cannot not be a place for a veterinarian in a 
UBPC devoted to raising livestock? Maybe in a miscellaneous 
crops enterprise! On the other hand, a veterinarian might indeed 
not be necessary at a miscellaneous crops enterprise, or a 
cane-growing UBPC. 
  "Now, let's look at another aspect of the problem. If the 
UBPC is a cattle-raising UPBC...[rephrases] I do think a place 
for that veterinarian must be found at some other cattle-raising 
UBPC that needs a veterinarian." 
  Roque adds: "And even if his UBPC is not a cattle-raising 
UPBC, a place for that veterinarian must be found, because how 
can we afford to leave a veterinarian without a job?" 
  Sexto agrees: "Exactly! Because certain paradoxical factors 
come into play here: If the Revolution is concerned with making 
sure that the medical student who is today in the classroom has 
a guaranteed job when he graduates, how can we possibly allow a 
veterinarian with 12 years' experience -- that means 12 
additional years of study, in addition to the practice -- to be 
without a job because no one can find a place for him? 
  "It is possible that it might be difficult, at the present 
time. But we must begin thinking about a solution.... 
  "I also want to tell you, Juan Carlos, that the responses of 
the authorities to whom he has gone, whom he has told about his 
problem, have been pretty indifferent, although they understood 
the problem. We think he cannot be told: Well, it is 
unavoidable, Doctor. Just resign yourself. 
  "I think no state organization can be allowed to give such 
an 
answer!" 
  Roque notes: That is where the problem of coordination comes 
in. I think these institutions have to have exchanges with 
others. The Labor Ministry in Sancti Spiritus, or the 
enterprises he himself has visited directly, have to begin 
seeking a solution to his problem, even if the problem is not 
their own. They too have to begin to make suggestions." 
  The speakers agree that the nation is seeking to make 
changes 
and find solutions to problems, but that erroneous 
interpretations of things do occur; also, not everyone does the 
right thing. Deficiencies continue to exist. 
  Sexto adds: "This also has to be looked at from another 
point 
of view, because if Decree-Law No. 141 permitted that 
veterinarian to treat privately, as a self-employed person, all 
the dogs and cats in Sancti Spiritus, it is possible that this 
man would not be facing the worry, the personal situation he is 
in today; but Decree-Law does not -- for now -- permit him to 
exercise his profession as a self-employed person. I think that 
this has to be kept in mind. I think cases like this could crop 
up not only in Sancti Spiritus but all over the country. 
  "There could be misinterpretations, and there could be 
objective situations that prevent there being work for a 
veterinarian, but formulas must be sought. What cannot be 
allowed to happen is for a veterinarian to (?remain) in such a 
situation. The country cannot afford the luxury of doing without 
such members of the work force!" 
  Roque agrees, saying that a lesson must be learned from this 
case. Sexto says that in his letter, the veterinarian says he 
knows of other cases like his own. 
  Sexto adds: "I want to say that this kind of problem is not 
solved with either a bureaucratic spirit or a bureaucratic 
mentality. I think a revolutionary, especially if he is an 
official, has to empathize with a citizen's problem as if it 
were his own. I think that is basic, in leading this country." 
Sexto says, further, that he thinks this is a case for the 
agricultural-livestock workers union. He says: "A recent CTC 
[Cuban Workers Federation] editorial in the newspaper 
TRABAJADORES said the unions had to follow such cases very 
closely, step by step, so as to avoid having injustices, 
deformations, and misinterpretations occur. And I think the case 
of Dr. Gonzalez in Sancti Spiritus must be assessed by the 
province's union. That union has to seek a solution." 
  Roque notes: "There lies the role -- first and foremost -- 
of 
the union sections, at the grassroots level. I am talking about 
the base-level, because many of these problems might be able to 
be solved at the very bottom." 
  Sexto notes that he wondered what the union's role might be 
at a UPBC if the workers own the production and if the president 
can be removed by an assembly of the workers when he messes up. 
"Now I think that role is, precisely, first of all, for the 
union to keep watch over the nation's best interests; and also 
to watch for cases such as this, which are obviously injustices, 
where people have obviously failed to think." 
  Roque concludes: "This is an alert to the entire country."

  [Text] A slight increase in electric generation is expected 
in 1994 at the Maximo Gomez Electric Plant in Mariel -- a plant 
that helps ameliorate the energy deficit of Havana and the 
national electric system -- according to Agustin Jimenez 
Saranda, the director of this plant operated by the Chemical and 
Energy Union. 
  Independently of last year's energy deficit, 80 percent of 
electrical power was generated by using Cuban oil. However, the 
production plan was based on the fuel available and in 
consideration of the deficits of other generating plants. [as 
heard] Although a great part of the electricity available is due 
to the use of Cuban oil, this oil needs various additives to 
counter corrosion and partially neutralize the effects of its 
high viscosity and sulfur content which obstruct its flow 
through the pipes and damage the steel plates. 
  Add to these difficulties the maintenance limitations which 
are dependent not only on material shortages but also on the 
labor force deficit. Agustin Jimenez Saranda pointed out, 
without raising false hopes, that proper maintenance might 
result in long term improvements and the energy situation will 
be less unnerving in '94 and succeeding years: a pleasing bit of 
news for the beginning of 1994.

  [Text] Havana, 8 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Carlos Lage, secretary 
of the Council of Minister's Executive Committee, announced 
today that the Cuban Government will face new difficulties this 
year in guaranteeing electricity and transportation to the 
population. "The tobacco harvest, the food program, and the 
sugar harvest will be given absolute priority in terms of oil 
supplies for 1994, Lage said after touring tobacco producing 
areas in the western province of Pinar del Rio. 
  Lage, considered the architect of the limited Cuban economic 
reforms, said the current tobacco harvest could be the best 
quality seen for the past few years if current weather 
conditions continue. 
  The lack of fertilizer and oil to operate equipment also 
affected Cuban tobacco production, a traditional export product. 
  Nevertheless, Lage said that this year the oil supply 
situation -- the Achilles' heel of the feeble Cuban economy, 
which has been affected by a serious crisis since the beginning 
of the decade -- will improve this year. 
  The shortage of oil (with its corollary lengthy power 
outages), passenger buses, and food were the main hardships the 
island's 11 million inhabitants faced last year. 
  The state-run Cuban Petroleum Enterprise (Cupet) announced 
during the first week of this year that it ended 1993 with a 
record production of 7.7 million barrels of heavy national crude 
oil with a high sulfur content. 
  Engineer Agustin Jimenez, director of the Maximo Gomez 
thermoelectric plant, admitted that the amount is barely enough 
to generate 40 percent of the electricity consumed on the 
island. Using that type of crude also causes excessive corrosion 
to burners and other equipment. 
  Cuba received an average 91 million barrels of oil per year 
in 1989 from the former USSR. 
  According to president Fidel Castro, the island's economy 
cannot function with less than 43 million barrels per year, most 
of which must be purchased on the international market or with 
sugar traded to Russia. 
  The authorities are determined to reach production levels of 
4.5 to 4.6 million tons of sugar this year. That figure is only 
a few hundred tons more than the 1992/1993 harvest, which was 
the poorest in the last few decades.

  [Text] Over the next few weeks, the Cuban workers movement 
will meet to discuss Cuba's main financial problems. This was 
announced by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban 
Workers Federation [CTC], in an appearance this morning on Radio 
Progreso's "First Thing" program. 
  [Begin Ross recording] Forty eight hours ago, the CTC 
National Secretariat agreed to begin this process. We must 
remember that Comrade Fidel stated in the National Assembly 
[ANPP] that none of the measures we need to take can be 
implemented if we do not have the understanding, consensus, and 
support of the workers. This is precisely our goal, to have the 
workers... [changes thought] and also the worker's opinions. 
Fidel said that the measures could not have a technocratic 
nature, but would be political measures grounded on technical 
aspects, of course. Our workers are very wise. Their wisdom 
includes the economic. What has happened is that at times they 
have not been heard, nor has what they have suggested been done. 
That is the reality. 
  We wish to fulfill that request and allow them more 
participation because the workers need to be the spinal column 
of everything done in the country on the economy. Everything 
done in terms of the economy affects the workers. [end recording] 
  Ross emphasized that the forthcoming meetings are another 
sign of the trust the Revolution has in the workers, adding: 
  [Begin Ross recording] For example, we are going to ask the 
opinion of 485,000 labor leaders on how to heal national 
finances. Do we change the currency or not? What to do with 
those who have great amounts of money, with those who have 
earned on the basis of their hard work, production efforts, and 
have accumulated that money? What to do with the money of those 
who, through theft, wheeling and dealing, hoarding, have 
accumulated it? We must add that there are 1.5 million workers 
who are paid between 100 and 121 pesos. There are 2.5 million 
who are paid between 121 and 186 pesos. Those earning 100 or 121 
pesos cannot have accumulated money. [end recording] 
  Finally, Ross pointed out that between now and 28 January, 
there will be in-depth training of the labor cadres at base 
level, to ensure that the process of discussing the national 
financial status with the workers becomes a successful process 
with practical results, ensures awareness, and particularly, is 
based on national economic problems.

  [Text] St. John's, Antigua, 8 Jan, CANA -- Antigua and 
Barbuda's main opposition group, the United Progressive Party 
[UPP], has launched its election campaign. At a public rally in 
St. John's this week, the party presented its 16 candidates for 
the poll, constitutionally due by March. 
  Political leader Baldwin Spencer said: "The people of 
Antigua 
and Barbuda .... Are ready to take our country back." He added: 
"We cannot claim to be a nation when we have not developed a 
nation economy. We cannot claim to be a nation when we are not 
in charge of our own affairs. We cannot claim to be a nation 
when we are dominated by foreign interests." 
  The parliamentary opposition leader admitted that "the 
challenge before (the party) is not easy." Spencer charged that 
the ruling Antigua Labour Party (ALP) "has failed miserably .... 
to do great things for the country." 
  The UPP's deputy political leader, Tim Hector, said the 
party 
was planning a national demonstration against the governor 
general's decision to pardon a government minister who was given 
a prison sentence after the court found he was involved in 
illegal mining of sand. 
  "We call the demonstration in support of justice against the 
pardon, against the governor general, against Hilroy Humphreys. 
I expect you to be there in great numbers," Hector told the 
meeting The party's campaign theme is "time for a change -- 
people first".

  [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 7 Jan, CANA -- Barbados 
unemployment rate during the third quarter of 1993 was pegged at

found employment in other areas of activity. 
  "The rate of participation during the review period was 66.3 
percent compared with 65.6 percent for the corresponding period 
in 1992," the ministry reported. "The rate for females rose by 
1.4 percentage points to reach 59.8 percent during the review 
period while that for males remained vitually unchanged at 73.8 
percent. 
  "The number of persons not in the labour force was 64,100

  [Text] The conference of presidents was held on 6 January 
in the Chamber of Deputies. This was an important meeting 
between the presidents of political blocs and permanent 
committees on 6 January at the Legislative Palace. The great 
majority of the 20 parliamentarians who participated in this 
meeting supported the idea of holding a national conference in 
Haiti with the participation of all sectors involved in the 
crisis. Chamber of Deputies President Antoine Joseph asserts 
that the issue of the parliamentarians elected on 18 January was 
also tackled. Joseph refused to announce the decision on that 
issue made by the presidents of the political blocs within the 
Chamber of Deputies. Let us listen to Antoine Joseph: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] The first point on the agenda 
was an analysis of the general situation of the country. Then 
there was an inventory or outline of the legislative works to 
set up during the seventh ordinary session of the 45th 
Legislature. Finally, we had questions of general interest. We 
have not yet gone through the second point, but there was great 
debate as to the general situation of the country. 
  One of the main ideas that has come out is that all 
political 
groups that were present...[rephrases] the presidents of the 
political groups encourage, on behalf of the groups, the idea 
that a national conference be held in the country with the 
participation of all sectors concerned in the Haitian crisis and 
all those who are examining the country's situation. With the 
exception of the National Front for Change and Democracy, which 
says it has a slight reservation, between now and tomorrow [7 
January] we will sign a common document in which we will 
formally encourage the national conference. But it is clear that 
something has been accomplished. There are four political groups 
which numerically are a majority within the Chamber of Deputies; 
we can say the majority of the Chamber of Deputies encourages 
the idea of a national conference. [end recording] 
  This was Deputy Antoine Joseph, president of the Chamber of 
Deputies that supports the idea of holding a national conference 
in Haiti with the participation of all sectors involved in the 
Haitian crisis.

<F P=106> [Report by Leontes Dorzilme -- recorded in Creole] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The United States has warned 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide that it considers the holding 
of a conference on refugees an insult, according to statements 
made on 6 January by U.S. diplomatic sources. The agenda for 
this conference entitled "Democracy in Haiti is the Solution to 
the Refugee Crisis" might be changed at the request of the 
United States, according to a diplomat who wanted to remain 
anonymous. The conference on the Haitian crisis, the question of 
human rights, and the rights of refugees could take place from 
14 to 16 January. 
  According to the HAITIAN PRESS AGENCY, there will be many 
observers such as guests from the UN conference, guests from the 
four countries friendly to Haiti, and delegates from the 10th 
Department [the Haitian diaspora]. They also plan to invite 
delegates from [political] parties represented in the Haitian 
parliament, particularly those that signed the New York pact. 
People from Haitian democratic organizations and representatives 
of the religious community here (?will also be invited). 
  The purpose of this summit, according to explanations, is to 
establish a dialogue between experts on human rights protection 
and those working in the diplomatic sectors and the democratic 
movements in order to find a quick means to resolve the Haitian 
crisis and allow the restoration of democracy. 
  The refugee problem remains a particularly thorny issue for 
the United States, which has maintained a naval blockade around 
Haiti since October 1993 to prevent the boat people's entering 
the United States. It also decided to repatriate those Haitians 
as soon as the U.S. Coast Guard catches them. The U.S. State 
Department adopted this position in May 1992. Diplomats from 
Haiti's four friendly countries say that they will merely be in 
attendance and that they will have a very low profile; others 
say (?their attitude will depend on) the agenda set. AFP has 
reported that they [not further identified] also let it be 
understood that they will do their best to ensure adherence to 
the agenda. 
  The OAS does not take an official stand on that issue. 
According to diplomatic sources, President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide asked OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena Soares 
to participate in this meeting. Soares said that the OAS cannot 
involve itself in such an adventure, according to a diplomat who 
wanted to remain anonymous. 
  President Aristide has called for the Miami conference in 
response to the idea of the national conference in Haiti that 
Prime Minister Robert Malval advocated. Since then, there has 
been a divergence between the United States and (?President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide) as to the policy he would like to adopt 
regarding a national conference. Up to the present, the United 
States has supported a national conference to untangle the 
crisis situation in Haiti, although it does not share President 
Aristide's idea of a conference on refugees in Miami on 14, 15, 
and 16 January. [passage omitted]

general and of Lawrence Pezzullo in particular to entrust the 
distribution of the fuel on a tanker expected to reach Haiti on 
12 January to a predetermined sector of the national life. 
  They firmly ask the international community to distribute 
this fuel equitably, without regard to political affiliation or 
social stratum. This commitment must be published in an official 
statement before the arrival of the tanker. Should the 
international community fail to make this commitment, these 
officials promise to oppose radically the distribution of fuel.

  [Text] Kingston, Jamaica, 7 Jan, CANA -- Jamaica's 
inflation rate for last November was 3.2 percent, boosting the 
rate for the first eleven months of the calendar year to 26.6 
percent, according to official figures just released here. 
  The statistical institute of Jamaica said the inflation rate 
for the first eight months of the fiscal year was 23.3 percent. 
Since July, inflation has averaged three percent per month, 
largely because of the weakening Jamaican dollar, which has 
fallen from an equivalent of 4.50 U.S. cents in mid-year to just 
over 3.10 cents currently. 
  Inflation for the 11-month period in the calendar year 1992 
was 39.4 percent and 17.3 percent for the equivalent fiscal year 
period.

  [Text] Kingston, Jamaica, 8 Jan, CANA -- Chairman of 
Jamaica's electoral advisory committee, Peter John Thwaites, has 
resigned. Thwaites was apparently angry about the failure so far 
to appoint a director of elections. A terse statement from 
Thwaites said the committee was "unable to find a candidate for 
the post of director of elections acceptable to all members...." 
  Thwaites, an insurance executive, was reported to be upset 
at 
the refusal of ruling People's National Party (PNP) 
representatives on the EAC to approve the application of Major 
Anthony Robinson, head of the Jamaica Manufacturers Association 
(JMA), for the job of director of elections. 
  The PNP is said to have objected to Robinson because he once 
served as an assistant to former commerce minister Douglas Vaz 
during the opposition Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) administration 
of the 1980's. Robinson in more recent times has been one of the 
more vocal critics of the government's economic policy. The JMA 
head has repeatedly ridiculed the P.J. Patterson government's 
high interest rate policies, meant to encourage savings and curb 
inflation, but which has also dampened investment and 
discouraged manufacturers. 
  Both the PNP and JLP are said to have supported the 
application of another military man, Major Winston Sutherland. 
But the High Command of the Jamaican Army has apparently refused 
to accommodate the application for Sutherland's release. 
  Jamaica has been without a director of elections since the 
middle of last year when Noel Lee was dropped at the insistence 
of the JLP. The JLP accused Lee of inefficiency in the run-up to 
and during the March 30 elections last year which was flawed by 
administrative mix- ups as well as fraud and thuggery in some 
mainly urban constituencies. 
  In a bid to attract high-profile applicants for the job, the 
EAC has offered a salary said to be close to a million Jamaican 
dollars per year (one Jamaica dollar = just over 3.10 U.S. 
cents). 
  Both the PNP and JLP expressed regret Friday at Thwaites' 
resignation. The PNP said he had been a "positive force" on the 
committee, while the JLP described him as "energetic and 
forthright." The governor general, meanwhile, says he intends to 
meet with Thwaites, apparently in a bid to influence a change of 
mind.

  [Text] Basseterre, St. Kitts, 8 Jan, CANA -- The St 
Kitts-Nevis Labour Party (SKNLP) has rejected plans by the 
government to privatise the sugar industry. 
  The SKNLP, responding to Prime Minister Kennedy Simmonds' 
announcement of ongoing divestment plans on Thursday, said it 
would not be bound by agreements between innocent parties and 
what it called an unconstitutional regime clinging to power 
against the expressed wishes of the people. 
  The Labour Party, which is maintaining its call for a fresh 
poll following inconclusive general elections last November 29, 
said in a statement Saturday it was committed to using its 
resources to oppose the process of divestment. 
  It says the Simmonds government has no mandate or other form 
of accepted authority to divest a substantial portion of the 
people's inheritance. 
  The party accused the Simmonds administration of reducing 
the 
sugar industry to a state which has resulted in a sharp decline 
in output and considerable lay-offs of workers. 
  Unable to rescue, revive and maintain the viability of the 
industry, the party statement said, the Simmonds government has 
taken an unauthorised decision to sell in part the sugar 
industry to private concerns, whose sole motive is profit. 
  The Labour Party re-affirmed its commitment to the retention 
of an integrated sugar industry. It said an efficiently managed 
industry can again be one of the effective earners of a large 
chunk of foreign exchange. 
  The SKNLP said a concerned government has an obligation to 
ensure the continued livelihood of citizens in the context of 
improved wages and conditions of employment.

  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 8 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad and 
Tobago's police commissioner, Jules Bernard, has issued a stern 
warning to Muslim leader Yasin Abu Bakr [name as received], 
whose followers staged a coup attempt here in 1990. 
  "I wish to advise all concerned that the police service, as 
the state agency charged with the responsibility to maintain law 
and order in the society, would take prompt and decisive action 
to deal with any attempt to disrupt the peace, order and 
tranquility of the society," Bernard said after Abu Bakr said 
his group felt as "oppressed" as it had when it staged the 
insurrection. 
  "It is important that all persons who may be inclined to 
embark on a path of unconventional behaviour be warned that the 
police would be vigilant and prepared to deal with any such 
activities." 
  Bakr, during a news conference, expressed dissatisfaction 
over the long time the court of appeal took in delivering the 
judgment in the dispute over lands the Muslimeen claims at 
Mucurapo in the northern township of St James. 
  The Muslim leader said his organisation had many options 
open 
to it regarding the land dispute with the government. 
  "We can't just starve to death and do nothing. The 
government is treating us unjustly. We have many options and we 
would not sit and do nothing. We will use the best option 
available to us," he told reporters. 
  He said that the organisation was not doing anything to 
create tension. 
  Abu Bakr added,"we are feeling oppressed and we would like 
to 
defend ourselves. "The same kind of oppression resulted in the 
1990 insurrection." 
  The Muslimeen held parliamentarians hostage in 1990, 
complaining of victimisation and economic hardships. Bakr and 
113 followers who gave themselves up afterwards were freed in 
1992 after a high court found that an amnesty which they 
received from acting President Emmanuel Carter was valid. 
  Previous governments and the Muslimeen have been at 
loggerheads over the ownership of the land, which eventually 
ended up in the courts. 
  Bakr, at the news conference, also complained that the state 
had failed to pay compension for the destruction of several 
buildings on the Mucurapo lands which were gutted by fire, 
shortly after the six-day siege of parliament.

  [Text] The Colombian Navy today confirmed the presence of 
more U.S. Marines in Colombia. General Octavio Gnecco, 
commander of naval infantry [as heard], said that in December 
U.S. military personnel not only arrived at Malaga Bay in Valle 
del Cauca Department, but also some 30 others arrived in Puerto 
Lopez, Meta Department. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter Alvaro Ayala] With the arrival 
of 
U.S. military personnel at Malaga Bay on 29 December, it became 
evident that U.S. troops are present in several regions of 
Colombia. According to the two governments, their presence has a 
humanitarian objective. The naval infantry commander said that 
a group of U.S. military personnel has been in Puerto Lopez, 
Meta Department, for several months, carrying out engineering 
projects. Nevertheless, he said he does not know why the public 
was not given an explanation about the presence of foreign 
troops there. 
  [Gnecco, in progress] ...of the U.S. Navy who are helping us 
build a river outpost. This work will conclude in February, and 
they will be returning to their bases. 
  [Ayala] How many are there? 
  [Gnecco] Approximately 30 men arrived in December. 
  [Ayala] But Uncle Sam's troops are not only in Juanchaco, 
Ladrilleros, Malaga Bay, and Puerto Lopez. The National Indian 
Organization has charged that Monochoa in Caqueta, Barrancon in 
Guaviare, and Leticia in Amazonas also have a foreign military 
presence. 
  Regarding Colonel Rodrigo Quinonez, who has been accused by 
a 
Navy noncommissioned officer of being the leader of a gang of 
paid assassins to eliminate union leaders of Barrancabermeja, 
Gnecco said that one must wait for the results of the 
investigations. Col. Quinonez, who is being investigated, is 
currently the Navy intelligence chief headquartered here at the 
Defense Ministry. [end recording]

This was seen in answers to Caracol's "Topic of the Day"

national sovereignty; 23.4 percent said Colombia has people to 
build a school or a health center, which are the projects the 
soldiers will work on; 18 percent felt the U.S. military 
presence is an indication that these soldiers might invade the 
country; 14.3 percent felt the goal is to install radar 
stations; and 10.4 percent stated the government must fully 
explain the U.S. military presence in the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Miriam Ortiz from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The presence of U.S. soldiers in Colombia is 
relatively new. Although it is known that they are posted 
throughout the country, their real mission here is not clear. 
It has been said that they are here to carry out civic work, 
but other sources insist they are participating in 
counternarcotics operations. 
  Several contingents of U.S. soldiers have arrived in 
Colombia 
to participate in the so-called cooperation plan in the struggle 
against drug trafficking. Several soldiers traveled to Leticia 
in the Amazon Region to install radar to control clandestine 
flights in the southern part of the country. That decision 
generated an extensive debate in Congress. Leticia residents 
protested, saying that heavily armed soldiers had occupied the 
streets. 
  A group of U.S. soldiers also arrived on San Andres Island 
to 
install a radar to control aircraft coming from the United 
States. Approximately 50 persons from the U.S. Navy, known as 
SeaBees, arrived to build a base equipped with several patrol 
boats on the banks of the Guaviare River. A similar mission is 
being conducted in the Puerto Lopez area, Meta Department. 
Soldiers from Ft. Rucker, Alabama, are stationed at Malaga Bay. 
  According to authorities from both countries, the troops 
arrived in Valle del Cauca to build a school and a clinic and to 
repair several roads in Juanchaco. The arrival of troops and 
their equipment in helicopters and warships has made residents 
of those areas skeptical; some believe they came with a 
different objective. 
  A total of six U.S. bases have been built throughout the 
country.

<F P=106> [Report by Magnolia Ruiz from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Attention, we have a last minute report. Today in 
Juanchaco on the Pacific Coast, one of the gringo Marines who 
arrived to build a little school said in a statement for the "TV 
Today" newscast that this territory in Malaga Bay belongs to 
them; in other words, that it is U.S. territory. 
  The 150 U.S. Southern Command soldiers are supposedly here 
to 
build a little school and a health center. Today, whatever the 
reason for their arrival, it is not the most important issue. 
Now the presence of the gringos has prompted various serious 
opinions that have divided island residents. Some strongly 
reject it, while others believe they should be given the 
opportunity to show their generous, unselfish intentions so 
people can trust them. Still others defend them by saying that 
at last good luck has come to Juanchaco to bring progress to the 
island. 
  [Begin recording] [Ruiz] Are you happy with the arrival of 
the gringo soldiers? 
  [Unidentified woman] Yes, I am happy, because they are here 
to help the people. 
  [Ruiz] How do they treat you? 
  [Woman] Very well. [end recording] 
  While area residents are trying to decide their position and 
focus on the benefits the gringos will bring for the children in 
education and health, the U.S. Marines know very well what they 
are doing. As sure of themselves as Peter in his own house, 
they transported a large amount of material by trucks down bumpy 
Juanchaco roads and began working. 
  In addition, today they decided that they definitely need an 
area in Colombian territory that belongs to them. The only 
requirement that could be added to the existing restrictions 
upon entering that territory would be asking Colombians to show 
a passport in their own country. 
  [Begin unidentified Colombian soldier recording] The area 
over there is not ours, it is their camp [words indistinct]. 
[end recording] 
  This spot where a Colombian Infantry marine is posted marks 
the limits between Colombia and U.S. territory that have been 
traced, limiting access to the media.

  [Text] Among the gringo workers who arrived at Juanchaco, 
there are professors whose speciality is not included in the 
education program of the small school they are building. The 
U.S. troops did not come to Colombia only to build civilian 
facilities; they have also gone into areas of conflict to 
conduct military training. 
  [Begin General Octavio Gnecco, Naval Infantry commander, 
recording] They have sent several U.S. Marines as temporary 
instructors, especially in river combat techniques. [end 
recording] 
  Several training exercises have already been held at a base 
called Barranco, located in Guaviare. The foreign military 
personnel, together with several engineers, have arrived with 
their weapons in the area. Just as in the Malaga Bay and Puerto 
Lopez areas, the military have been sent by the United States to 
help the Colombian Navy build several facilities. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Have those 
instructors also given antiguerrilla courses in Colombia? 
  [Gnecco] Yes, on several occasions. Based on a U.S. Army 
offer, we held a one-month training course for our troops in San 
Jose del Guaviare. [end recording] 
  This type of military training has also been given in Puerto 
Legizamo and, according to the Colombian Navy, is also part of 
the cooperation agreement with the United States. What we do 
not know is, as is happening in other parts of Colombia, 
military advisers are also arriving, and not as professors of 
the school they are going to build in the Malaga Bay area.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Dario Restrepo from the "24 Hours" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Army's general command reported this afternoon 
that the crimes attributed to the corps' intelligence network 
are being investigated by the Prosecutor General's Office, the 
military authorities, and the inspectors general of the Armed 
Forces and the Navy. Preliminary information has been reported 
by LA PRENSA. This is the story: 
  Journalists who attended the funeral of Ismael Jaimes, LA 
OPINION editor in chief in Barrancabermeja, thought they knew 
who the assassins were. Today they have learned the truth -- a 
Navy intelligence network led by Colonel Rodrigo Quinonez became 
a gang of killers. 
  Two of the Navy members who were part of that intelligence 
network turned over to the Prosecutor General's Office and the 
Attorney General's Office testimonies and evidence on 
approximately 100 assassinations that were planned and carried 
out like routine business. This can be heard during a taped 
conversation regarding the identification and death of an 
informer. 
  [Begin recording] [First unidentified speaker] That is how 
it will be done. 
  [Second unidentified speaker] That is the least important 
thing because if an appointment is made, meaning he is told he 
must go to a certain place on a certain date.... [pauses] all we 
have to do is leave a message [words indistinct]. He can be 
called and an appointment can be made for two days later, or 
something like that. The young man will go and he will be told 
to be alert because a man -- whose description he will be given 
-- will arrive. Juan Carlos knows him. 
  [First speaker] How can [words indistinct]? 
  [Second speaker] We can call him from here. [end recording] 
  The document published by LA PRENSA again reviews the fact 
that military members have been corrupted by the war and have 
become assassins. 
  [Begin journalist Gonzalo Guillen recording] I believe it is 
one of the most monstrous things that have happened in this 
country. It is one of the most atrocious crimes because the 
state is assassinating the people. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Reports on the crash of a Venezuelan National Guard 
helicopter in Colombian territory continue to become more 
confusing. We have arrived in the zone and have established 
various issues there: First, the Venezuelan helicopter had 
landed in Colombian territory hours before the crash; second, it 
was not attacked by Colombian guerrilla groups, but it suffered 
an accident because it was carrying too much weight--and its 
crew members arbitrarily arrested various Colombian fishermen. 
Third, the shots fired from the aircraft were actually fired by 
the Venezuelan military to justify their actions. 
  The Army Commander has this document on his desk, the 
official report sent by the Colombian Armed Forces concerning 
the incident. The document's contents reveal: The confidential 
report sent in recently by the 2d Operation Command to the 
General Command in Santa Fe de Bogota registers, step by step, 
the operation executed yesterday by the Venezuelan military. 
Colonel Arcesio Barrero narrates to Army Commander General 
Hernan Jose Guzman the actions executed by the Venezuelan 
National Guard members. For example, he says the military 
suddenly entered Colombian territory, beat up civilians, 
insulted them, stole their money, and threatened them with 
death. The document becomes the strongest evidence of a 
violation of sovereignty that the government has in its power. 
It is the report from an appalled high-ranking Colombian Army 
officer who tells his superior about the Venezuelan Army's 
capacity for aggression. 
  The document clearly establishes there was never an 
intervention by the Colombian guerrilla forces, and the bullet 
holes in the helicopter were caused by the Venezuelan military 
members' own weapons to claim the aircraft had fallen due to a 
subversive action.

<F P=106> [Report by Miriam Ortiz from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A report by the "24 Hours" newscast more than a 
week ago has assumed unexpected proportions. First, a member of 
the ELN [Army of National Liberation] guerrilla group had 
reported that the Venezuelan National Guard was selling weapons 
to guerrilla groups in our country. The report was confirmed by 
Army Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman, and it has been fully 
confirmed by authorities on the border zone. 
  Three of the six departments located along the Venezuelan 
border--Norte de Santader, Arauca, and Vichada--have become the 
most vulnerable points for the trafficking of drugs and tons of 
weapons. Army forces in Arauca have just prevented the arrival 
of a weapons shipment intended for Colombian guerrilla groups. 
  [Begin General Alvaro Velandia, 16th Brigade commander, 
recording] A group was waiting for some materiel from the 
neighboring country. [end recording] 
  The weapons confiscated by the Army from the guerrilla 
forces 
during a sting operation included three Venezuelan-made 
revolvers. 
  [Begin recording] [Velandia] As you can see, here is a logo. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Yes, of the Venezuelan weapons 
factory. 
  [Velandia] Of Cavim [Venezuelan Corporation of Military 
Industries]. [end recording] 
  Arauca Governor Alfredo Colmenares also referred to the hard 
evidence against the Venezuelan military in connection with the 
gunrunning operations. 
  [Begin Colmenares recording] They are conniving and 
associating with Colombian guerrillas. They are seriously 
implicated, and there is evidence confirming this. [end 
recording] 
  According to Vichada Governor Rafael Celis, his department 
has become a haven for guerrillas, and the lack of controls at 
each side of the border facilitates gunrunning. 
  [Begin Celis recording] This is a major problem, considering 
that the Arauca River flows into the Orinoco River. [end 
recording] 
  The Army must control 2,220 km at the border not only to 
prevent arms trafficking, but because, according to reports, 
more than 20 Venezuelan citizens have arrived in Colombia to be 
trained by the ELN and FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia]. Authorities are also investigating reports that an 
ELN cell is operating in the Venezuelan States of Apure and El 
Amparo.

  [Text] Official sources have told this daily that President 
Luis Alberto Lacalle and Interior Minister Raul Iturria 
evaluated yesterday all aspects related to the attack on the 
house of prosecutor Jose Luis Barbagelata. They agreed that it 
was an action motivated by "a desire to create a political 
event." 
  President Lacalle reiterated to the interior minister "his 
total support" in "getting to the bottom" of the matter within 
the framework of the investigations being carried out to find 
those responsible for the attack, which was labeled "a political 
issue." 
  The Artigas Guard claimed responsibility for the attack. 
This is a clandestine group whose members identify themselves 
as the intermediate commands of the Army. This group also 
claimed responsibility for the attack against the studio of 
former President Julio Sanguinetti in mid-1992, in addition to 
other actions. 
  Military sources told this daily that the Army is continuing 
the investigation ordered by Army Commander Daniel Garcia when 
the clandestine organization released the so-called Bulletin No. 
2. 
  A military source said: "No conclusion has been reached, and 
therefore nothing certain can be said. The Artigas Guard is 
being investigated, including its possible connections with the 
Army if it has any, because its members call themselves the 
intermediate commands." Military and government sources 
indicated that "there is no evidence" to presume they are indeed 
military personnel. 
  One of the sources said: "They call themselves intermediate 
commands, but this has not been verified. It has also not been 
verified what their composition is: whether they be civilian, 
civilian and military, or military alone." 
  Army Commander General Daniel Garcia told this newspaper on 
7 
October 1993 that "the people responsible for the attack have 
not yet been identified, but when this happens it will be known 
because there will be a very big noise. Working in silence does 
not mean we are not working." 
  He added: "The day we find the members of the so-called 
Artigas Guard, or anyone responsible for any other irregular 
event, we will react vigorously within the current legal 
regulations." 
  The official sources noted that the investigation of this 
case is being carried out by the Security and Investigation 
Directorate of the Police Information and Intelligence National 
Directorate and by the Technical Police National Directorate, in 
cooperation with the Defense Information Service of the Defense 
Ministry.

  [Text] The executive branch has ordered the creation of a 
Center for Advanced National Studies [Centro de Altos Estudios 
Nacionales] (Calen) with the purpose of training Armed Forces 
officers and civilians from both the public and private sectors 
in strategic planning and advising. 
  The objective of Calen is, among others, to increase 
knowledge of the true national situation within a regional, 
continental, and international context, through appropriate and 
modern methodologies. 
  This center will be in charge of the National Higher Studies 
Course established in 1986. The center will be headed by a 
director, who will be responsible to the Defense Ministry. It 
will also have an academic deputy director and a course director. 
  The post of director will be held by a general, and the 
deputy director will be a civilian (a professional with a 
university degree), or a graduate from Calen or from Esendena 
[National Defense and Security School]. 
  The executive branch will select the civilians who will 
study 
in Calen, who will be nominated by various organizations. The 
Defense Ministry and Armed Forces commanders will nominate 
officers to attend the courses. 
  Within the military career, the completion of these courses 
will be considered credit toward attaining an assignment. 
  According to the Defense Ministry the creation of this 
center 
will not represent any expense, because all the necessary 
resources are already available and need only be reallocated.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondents Melisa Soto and Zaida Pereira; </F>
from "The News" newscast] 
  [Text] The implementation of the value-added tax [IVA] has 
been temporarily suspended over the entire country until the 
people are duly informed about it. Melisa Soto has more details. 
  [Soto] The Third Tax Disputes Court, presided by Judge 
Orlando Sarti, made the surprising decision after lawyer Rafael 
Balled Mardeni filed last Thursday a Constitutional amparo 
petition requesting the suspension of the IVA implementation. 
The lawyer felt the IVA implementation violates Articles 223 
and 49 of the Constitution, as it undermines the rights of 
Venezuelan citizens since they are not duly informed about the 
implementation of the IVA. In the lawyer's opinion, this has 
lead to great confusion among the people and total anarchy on 
the part of merchants when they collect this tax. 
  [Begin recording] [Balled] I sincerely feel we have 
prevented 
a mass uprising like the one that took place on 27 February, 
because there is no way to stop the merchants' abuses in 
collecting this tax from the people. 
  [Soto] Do you not think this situation may cause greater 
confusion among the people. 
  [Balled] Not at all. Henceforth, the government will have to 
properly inform the people about the tax, something they have to 
do now because of the amparo petition filed, and everybody will 
immediately stop paying IVA. 
  [Soto] How long will the temporary suspension last? 
  [Sarti] It is no secret people have been paying IVA since 
last year, although the law and its regulations stated it was 
going to enter into effect on 1 January 1994. It is no secret 
people have been paying it since last year. This has been true 
anarchy. As for a timetable.... [pauses] the court did not give 
the government a timetable, because it felt that the Executive 
Branch's wisdom, or rather that the government's wisdom may be 
reflected in whether it takes a long or short time in 
implementing a good information campaign of what this tax should 
be, namely, the people should be able to understand it. [end 
recording] 
  [Soto] MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] Senator Cristobal 
Fernandez intervened as a witness in this suit. 
  [Begin recording] [Fernandez] We warned from the start that 
because this is a regressive and unjust tax it would be an 
unbearable burden on low-income groups and that ultimately it 
does not provide a solution to close the fiscal gap, which is 
what the government sought with it. We believe the next 
congress must establish a new tax collection system and a 
broader tax reform, which puts the burden on large income and 
luxury goods and avoids imposing such a heavy burden on the 
people of Venezuela. [end recording] 
  [Soto] It is worth noting that any merchant who, starting at 
1100 on Thursday, continues to collect IVA will commit an 
offense that may be punishable with jail. 
  Upon learning of the ruling by the Third Tax Disputes Court 
suspending the IVA, Finance Ministry Adviser Alcides Villalba 
stressed the Constitutional amparo does not suspend the tax, so 
it will continue to be collected. 
  [Pereira] Villalba added the amparo petition will be 
appealed 
if it is made official, since the Court has not handed the 
ruling to the Finance Ministry, the Prosecutor General's Office, 
or the Comptroller General's Office. In his opinion, this 
ruling only serves to confuse the people since some people 
refuse to pay this tax. Villalba stated the amparo brings about 
a suspension when it refers to other cases, but since this is a 
tax measure the amparo does not have this effect. This is an 
individual not a collective amparo, he noted, adding it cannot 
be carried out. He also said the survival of the Venezuelan 
State depends on the IVA. 
  [Begin recording] [Villalba] As I understand it, based on 
news media reports, many of them reliable and others not so.... 
  [Unidentified speaker, interrupting] It may be 
disinformation. 
  [Villalba] Based on disinformation, the judge said there is 
widespread misinformation. I would ask the judge if he reads 
the newspapers. This has been in the media. This problem has 
been under discussion in this country for three years. [end 
recording] 
  [Pereira] The Finance Ministry representative said this is a 
political decision, and if it had come at another time, he would 
have thought the purpose was to destabilize the government. 
  Meanwhile, President Ramon J. Velasquez said the IVA 
implementation is not a whim of the Executive Branch since it 
responds to the reforms to the tax system that have been under 
study for almost four years. He added the new tax is necessary 
to control the fiscal deficit that has been worsening the 
country's economic and social situation year after year. 
  [Begin Velasquez recording] The IVA is a fiscal necessity. I 
want to explain that the government I have been leading since 
June did not invent it. It was part of a modernization program 
of the Venezuelan fiscal system, which had been agreed on since 
1989. Along with the other laws that became part of the special 
powers law, the Congress was unable to approve them for 
basically political reasons. My government took on the 
responsibility of promulgating those laws. The state's fiscal 
deficit is profoundly harming the situation in Venezuela, 
because it leads to a permanent devaluation of the bolivar due 
to inflation and to this enormous social cost that 20 million 
Venezuelans are paying. Let us not say 20 million, rather 18 
million Venezuelans; two million persons are not suffering. 
  The oil revenues keep coming in, but it is no longer 
sufficient to meet all the requirements of the state, which has 
to pay 1.2 million public employees and state employees 
protected by collective agreements and which has the obligation 
to maintain health, education, public security, and road 
services and to maintain the equipment of the Armed Forces. We 
must find other fiscal resources that will, among other things, 
make it possible to lower the fiscal deficit, and -- this is 
something the government that will take office in 28 days will 
do -- seek other income formulas and resources that will make it 
possible to lower that deficit in one, two, or three years. [end 
recording]

  [Excerpt] The attorney general of the Republic and the 
finance minister have commented on the ruling issued by the 3d 
Court for Tax Issues and agreed it does not invalidate the 
collection of the value-added tax [IVA]. Instead, it urges the 
Executive Branch to better publicize the law. 
  [Begin recording] [Attorney General Ricardo Ernst Contreras] 
The law is still in effect. A court ruling in connection with a 
request submitted by anyone does not derogate a law. Laws are 
only derogated by other laws. Laws are also derogated when 
someone submits an appeal for annulment because the law violates 
the constitution -- and the appeal has sufficient grounds. This 
can involve the whole law or some of its provisions. 
  Also, a law can be rescinded in connection with a given 
process because one of the interested parties claims the law 
violates the Constitution. However, the ruling issued by such a 
court in connection with such an appeal obviously cannot 
derogate a law. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The national government will not acknowledge a 
constitutional amparo on the value-added tax [IVA], as an amparo 
is a legal instrument that only benefits the individual who 
submits it. Therefore, it cannot have a collective nature or 
effects. 
  As for the claims by lawyer Rafael Bayed on the lack of 
information in applying the IVA, Finance Minister Carlos Rafael 
Silva feels that an appropriate campaign was conducted in 
implementing it. 
  [Begin Silva recording] The government has complied with the 
constitutional provision that compels it to publish in the 
official gazette of the Republic of Venezuela the laws that -- 
in this case -- were discussed and promulgated. [indistinct 
questions by several reporters] 
  In addition, you all know very well that the national 
government has made a tremendous effort to publicize the IVA in 
all media. This has been published in every newspaper in the 
country, in addition to having been reported by all audio and 
visual media which have emphasized exceptions made for food and 
medications, in addition to several services. [end recording]

  [Text] The Finance Ministry has urged merchants to charge 
the value-added tax [IVA] and asked consumers not to refuse to 
pay it, noting that noncompliance with this mandate will be 
punished according to the law. 
  Finance Ministry Legal Adviser Rafael Silva said only the 
Supreme Court of Justice can abolish the IVA law, and therefore 
it cannot be suspended by a judge, because this would be 
unconstitutional. He added that the legal basis for the writ of 
amparo is not clear, because it does not specify what right was 
violated and places the state in a defenseless legal position 
[indefension judicial]. Furthermore, the writ of amparo demands 
from the government additional information on the implementation 
of the IVA -- a measure that is not required when a law is 
implemented. He stressed that this tax cannot be suspended. 
  [Begin Silva recording] The Finance Ministry has no legal 
authority and no legal instrument enabling it to suspend the 
implementation of a law. We cannot do that. In any event, what 
the Finance Ministry could probably do after being legally 
notified of the decision is to instruct customs not to charge 
the IVA, or not collect the IVA, which is the only tributary 
obligation this would entail for the Finance Ministry. [end 
recording] 
  The Finance Ministry has not taken any action against the 
judge who issued a ruling eliminating the IVA. Nevertheless, 
Finance Minister Adviser Alcides Villalba has requested his 
dismissal.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Ignacio Mayorca] </F>
  [Text] I am very concerned about the situation created by 
the implementation of the IVA on the general public. I am 
especially concerned about the exorbitant speculation that has 
been unleashed in the country, largely due to a lack of 
information and control. 
  President-elect Rafael Caldera thus argued his opposition to 
the IVA in the light of the court decision forcing the 
government to suspend its implementation. 
  Caldera said: "I clearly informed President Velasquez' 
administration" of the impoverishing effects the IVA would have 
on the people. 
  President Velasquez feels committed and forced to maintain 
the IVA because he views it as a pledge he made at the time of 
his election. As a concession, he agreed to an exemption in a 
number of fundamental areas such as food, medical treatment, 
medicine, and travel. 
  According to Caldera, these exemptions were agreed upon with 
the promise to increase taxes on luxury items. However, he 
believes it might be better to adopt a position more like that 
of the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism]. The tax should be 
imposed more heavily on sectors that are better able to pay, 
which would at least partially reduce the fiscal deficit. 
  The president-elect returned to the issue of speculation to 
point out the current government's "apparent powerlessness" in 
dealing with it. In view of this situation, he said, the events 
and reasons that led to the court decision were "obvious. 
Everyone acknowledges them." 
  Caldera said: I am not prepared at this moment to issue a 
legal opinion concerning the origins, background, and 
consequences of this measure, which is quite new in Venezuela's 
legal history. I would prefer to express an opinion after 
gaining a clearer view of this matter. 
  Caldera announced that following the installation of the 
legislature he will introduce a "complete and full proposal to 
reform the tax system." The idea is to put the burden on those 
who can really pay the tax.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Pachano from "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The decision on the measures to be adopted to combat 
the wave of speculation resulting from value-added tax [VAT] 
implementation has been postponed until tomorrow. A special 
Economic Cabinet meeting will be held at 1700 on 9 January. 
  A special Economic Cabinet session to analyze possible 
measures to stop the wave of speculation unleashed by VAT 
implementation ended a few minutes ago. Rosana Ordonez, Central 
Information Office director, reported the details of the 
measures being analyzed: 
  [Begin recording] [Ordonez] There was a meeting of the 
Economic Cabinet this afternoon, with the participation of 
Finance Ministry officials. Again, they stated that Venezuelans 
must accept VAT as a tax in order to cover the fiscal deficit. 
Unless additional revenues are collected, we will be unable to 
cover expenses at universities, the government payroll, and 
other public expenses. 
  Economic experts were consulted on certain existing doubts 
regarding VAT implementation due to misinformation. They said 
that these doubts have existed in all countries where VAT has 
been implemented but that they gradually disappear through 
information campaigns through the media. 
  At the same time, there has been speculation that is 
unrelated to VAT, because the products on which prices have been 
increased are precisely those exempted from VAT, such as milk, 
eggs, beef, and consumer products. Specific measures are being 
analyzed to control this wave of speculation and punish those 
who are abusing the people's economic possibilities. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will sanctions include closing 
businesses? 
  [Ordonez] I cannot tell you what type of sanctions will be 
adopted, as they are being analyzed and will be announced 
tomorrow after a Council of Ministers meeting that will take 
place at 1700. What we want people to know is that the 
government is concerned about the situation, which is being 
analyzed. The situation is difficult and complex, and thus we 
are meeting every day, including Saturday and Sunday. We are 
studying options and possibilities within existing laws, so that 
within the state of law citizens can feel that the government is 
concerned about an unusual situation of speculation. The 
current government will tend to the problems affecting 
Venezuelan citizens until the next government assumes power. 
[end recording] 
  The aim of the measures being analyzed is to inform the 
public that the government definitely wants to stop the wave of 
speculation for the benefit of consumers.

  [Text] According to Copei [Social Christian Party] leader 
Eduardo Fernandez, his party is willing to establish a national 
agreement to support President-elect Rafael Caldera, thus 
showing its support for the democratic system. 
  Fernandez made the statement as he was leaving a breakfast 
meeting with President Ramon J. Velasquez during which they 
analyzed the country's current situation and the issues the 
Caldera administration will face. 
  Eduardo Fernandez insisted that he will not return to the 
post of secretary general of his party, indicating that it is a 
role he has already fulfilled. He said Copei is a party that 
reaches agreements, and that is why it would endorse Caldera's 
request for support so he can have the political backing 
necessary to manage the country over the next five years. 
  [Begin Fernandez recording] The magnitude of the country's 
problems demands an effort of national understanding and unity. 
We must foster a climate to face the country's basic problems. 
[end recording] 
  Asked about the initiative to allow National Convergence to 
lead the Senate, he said it is one possibility that must be 
analyzed, adding that it is very possible it will become a 
reality.

  [Text] Caracas, Jan 7 (AFP) -- A Caracas radio station has 
reported that a helicopter of the militarized Venezuelan 
National Guard was downed in the Cutufi area near the Arauca 
River, close to the border with Colombia, after an attack by 
Colombian guerrillas. 
  Reports by Radio Caracas indicate that according to police 
sources in the area, a helicopter that was patrolling the border 
area was downed by a Colombian rebel commando. The crash had 
initially been attributed to technical problems. Two military 
policemen were injured. 
  Colombian rebels attacks, which have resulted in five deaths 
and the destruction of several military vehicles, have created 
friction between Bogota and Caracas over the past few months.

  [Text] Another incident has exacerbated the already tense 
situation on the Colombian-Venezuelan border. The Guerrilla 
Coordinating Board downed a civilian helicopter from Venezuela 
that was transporting Venezuelan soldiers. The subversives also 
dynamited a vehicle transporting children in Aguazul, Casanare. 
  [Begin reporter Alvaro Ayala recording] The public order 
situation on the Colombian-Venezuelan border worsened today when 
ELN [Army of National Liberation] guerrillas opened fire on a 
civilian helicopter transporting Venezuelan soldiers. The 
incident occurred near the mouth of the Arauca River near 
Saravena. The two civilian pilots and four soldiers in the 
helicopter were seriously injured. They were subsequently 
rescued by the Venezuelan National Guard. 
  Meanwhile, the Guerrilla Coordinating Board dynamited a jeep 
of tourists coming from Boyaca as they were passing through 
Aguazul Municipality, Casanare. Two adults were killed and eight 
people, including seven children, were seriously injured. [end 
recording] 
  Regarding the case of the helicopter downed on the 
Colombian- 
Venezuelan border, we have just received another report from 
Arauca. According to that report, the Venezuelan helicopter 
landed in Colombian territory to pick up some peasants, and that 
is what led to the attack. The authorities are expected to 
issue a report on the events.

  [Text] Caracas, 8 Jan (AFP) -- Intelligence officers in the 
Venezuelan Armed Forces have reported a strong presence of 
Colombian guerrillas at the Venezuelan-Colombian border, 
according to newspaper reports published in Caracas on Saturday. 
  According to EL NACIONAL, the Venezuelan Army intelligence 
section detected a guerrilla column of no fewer than 50 men, 
allegedly from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC), between Junin Municipality in Tachira State, some 600 km 
southwest of Caracas, and Norte de Santander Department in 
Colombia. Area residents confirmed the military report. 
  EL NACIONAL, quoting reliable military sources, added that 
the presence of Colombian guerrillas was discovered during a 
joint operation by the Colombian and Venezuelan Armies, which 
led to the declaration of a state of maximum alert and the 
reinforcement of border posts. 
  Likewise, the national press agency VENPRES quoted 
Venezuelan 
military sources as saying that some 10,000 Colombian guerrillas 
are reportedly on the border between the two countries. 
  According to VENPRES, the rebels are responsible for the 
intense "theater of war" over the past seven months, which 
included an increase in kidnappings and cattle rustling 
incidents. 
  Late last year five Venezuelan soldiers were killed in two 
explosive attacks attributed to the National Liberation Army of 
Colombia, which prompted angry reactions in Caracas. 
  As for the Venezuelan National Guard helicopter crash 
yesterday in which two soldiers were injured, military spokesmen 
described the incident as "a strong reaction by the Colombian 
guerrillas to the active Venezuelan air and land patrols over 
the southwestern border of the country." 
  Defense Ministry spokesmen, however, have not yet explained 
the real cause of the helicopter crash. Some police spokesmen 
say it was caused by a guerrilla attack, while Colombian 
authorities say excess weight caused the crash and that the 
shots were fired by the Venezuelan soldiers themselves.

  [Text] The armed clashes continue in Chiapas. Indians and 
peasants arriving in San Cristobal are being placed in a relief 
shelter called Don Bosco. The National Human Rights Commission 
has asked the San Cristobal Municipal Government and the state 
and federal governments to set up shelters immediately. It is 
expected that more families will arrive in San Cristobal during 
Friday evening and Saturday. 
  In Tuxtla Gutierrez, near Chapa de Corso, military 
checkpoints supported by the Federal Highway Patrol have 
increased their search of vehicles. Schools in San Cristobal de 
las Casas and other cities near the war zone are still 
paralyzed. Mexican Army vehicles have started leaving San 
Cristobal to take supplies to the war zone. The supplies will 
be distributed in affected towns, which are calling for water 
and food in order to survive. 
  In Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, 14 detainees 
were turned over to the Attorney General's Office. Also in 
Tuxtla, at least 48 bodies were exhumed from San Marcos cemetery 
vaults. The bodies were considerably decayed. Rubber gloves 
and face masks were found at the cemetery as well as numbers 
that had been assigned to the bodies. 
  Combat between the Army and the armed groups occurs 
primarily 
during the evening and morning. Trucks with vegetables 
circulated between San Cristobal de las Casas and Tuxtla 
Gutierrez on Friday. The Indian communities in Chiapas Heights 
are the primary vegetable suppliers for the state capital and 
San Cristobal. The only way to San Cristobal de las Casas is 
through Tuxtla. There is no other way, because the other 
highways are closed and the war zone is isolated.

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez (Mexico), 7 Jan (EFE) -- The 
Mexican Government has undertaken an operation to help the 
civilian population in Chiapas State, victims of the armed 
conflict between the Army and rebel groups since 1 January. 
  With the intensification of clashes between the Mexican 
Armed 
Forces and the rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) 
near dozens of civilian towns, thousands of residents are 
without basic services and have fled their homes to save their 
lives. Almost 1,000 peasants and Indians have been caught in 
the middle of the Air Force bombardment of the mountainous San 
Cristobal de las Casas area and in the midst of crossfires that 
have destroyed homes and crops. 
  In response to complaints by civilians, the Mexican Army has 
reiterated that its forces have not attacked civilian towns and 
pledged not to do so. 
  The government, church, and civilian organizations are 
setting up shelters for the Indians and peasants who have fled 
their homes because of the bombings. Thus far two shelters have 
been established in towns far from San Cristobal de las Casas 
and near neighboring Tabasco State, where civilians seeking help 
will be temporarily housed and their safety against rebel 
attacks guaranteed. It is expected that between today and 
tomorrow another two shelters will be opened. Additionally, 
corn, beans, rice, sugar, oil, powdered milk, and soup 
concentrate are being distributed among the most severely 
affected civilians. State-owned Mexican Petroleum expects to 
send approximately 20 tons of supplies to the area between today 
and tomorrow. 
  Hundreds of EZLN members have focused on occupying small 
towns in southern Chiapas to threaten the authorities and 
proclaim fragile victories over the soldiers; in the process, 
they have cut off sewage services and the supply of gas, power, 
and potable water. Dozens of tanker trucks have been sent from 
Mexico City with 50,000 liters of potable water to prevent the 
spread of gastrointestinal diseases among the civilian 
population. As a result of the shortage of domestic gas, the 
operation of a mobile plant has been authorized in the war zone 
to normalize the supply of fuel and to avoid further problems 
for the civilian population. 
  Meanwhile, the Institute of Social Security and Services for 
Government Workers (ISSSTE) has sent ambulances, several tons of 
surgical equipment, analgesics, antidiarrhetics, plasma 
expanders, and first aid material. It is expected that the 
ISSSTE and other medical institutions will continue to send 
medicine, vaccines against typhoid fever and tetanus, oral 
serum, antibiotics, and other first aid material. 
  Meanwhile, the National Defense Secretariat (SDN) reiterated 
today in a press communique that the Armed Forces have not 
staged any attacks whatsoever on civilian targets. "The SDN has 
paid special attention to the protection of the civilian 
population and respect for human rights during the course of the 
operations under way in the area," the communique asserts. The 
communique also states that during combat on Thursday one 
soldier was killed and eight were seriously wounded. The SDN 
has officially announced that almost 100 people have been killed 
in the clashes, including soldiers, rebels and civilians, but 
Red Cross reports indicate that the bodies of at least 190 
rebels have been picked up from the streets.

  [Text] The Attorney General's Office [PGR] reported today 
it has started a preliminary investigation into the possibility 
that some of those who have died in Chiapas were executed and 
received a coup de grace. Referring to the investigation, the 
PGR said autopsies and ballistic tests were performed yesterday 
with 30 corpses found in Ocosingo, Chiapas. 
  The PGR reported 26 of these corpses showed no signs of 
having received a coup de grace shot. The studies and experts' 
reports on the four other corpses, which showed a shot in the 
skull, revealed they had died on different days and at different 
hours and showed that the shots were fired from a short 
distance. It also reports that two corpses sustained shots with 
calibers that are smaller than those reserved for or used by the 
Armed Forces. A third corpse sustained injuries caused by a 
very powerful weapon, and a fourth corpse sustained shots fired 
by a shotgun, given the metal shrapnel wounds it had, the PGR 
said. 
  The PGR also said that in three of the cases the reports 
rule 
out the possibility the shots were fired by a member of the 
Mexican Army, because it does not use the type of weapon used to 
inflict them. Referring to the shot fired by a very powerful 
weapon, no one has been able to ascertain from which side it 
came, because the armed and violent group has been using that 
type of weaponry, the PGR said.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 8 Jan (AFP) -- 
President Carlos Salinas appointed a commission of Chiapas 
residents to "contribute" to restoring coexistence and normalcy 
to Chiapas," which for the past eight days has been shaken by 
clashes between the Army and guerrillas, the government reported 
on Saturday. 
  Social Development Secretary Carlos Rojas swore in the 
commission, which is made up of writer Eraclio Zepeda, 
anthropologist Andres Fabregas, and Institutional Revolutionary 
Party Senator Eduardo Robledo. 
  The commission "will have complete independence to evaluate 
the situation and the problems that need to be resolved as well 
as to make suggestions about options and actions to efficiently 
face the problems in the conflict areas," it was reported. 
  Rojas said the commission members' backgrounds "and their 
roots and identification with the people of Chiapas guarantee an 
objective reflection of the prevailing situation in the state 
and an intense dialogue with social organizations and 
communities in an effort to improve living conditions."

  [Text] Mexico City, 8 Jan (EFE) -- Alleged members of the 
rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) have sent a 
communique to the Mexican daily LA JORNADA in which they claim 
to be ready to engage in a written dialogue with the government. 
  The communique states that the rebels will engage in 
dialogue 
with the government with the mediation of Guatemalan indigenous 
leader Rigoberta Menchu, Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who has worked on 
behalf of indigenous peoples, and Julio Scherer, director of the 
weekly PROCESO, "whom they have never been able to silence." 
  The document was faxed by the "Clandestine Committee of the 
Struggling Indigenous Peoples of the EZLN" and states that the 
decision to begin a written public dialogue with the government 
"does not imply a surrender." 
  "We believe that these three personalities, renowned in 
Mexican society, could serve as guarantors of the truth and 
witnesses that the writings are really those of the EZLN. We 
would ask them to render their good offices in search of the 
peace and welfare of our struggling people," the note states. 
  The alleged EZLN members, who took up arms on 1 January in 
the southern state of Chiapas, have asked Menchu, Ruiz, and 
Scherer to publicly respond to their appeal. The EZLN states 
that if they receive a positive response, they will ask the 
three individuals "to mediate the dialogue between the poor, 
struggling people and their hangmen." 
  They also invite the three persons to visit the EZLN General 
Command in Lacandona jungle in Chiapas, "where they will always 
be well received and protected, to receive our document of 
proposals." 
  The communique notes that the first phase of the struggle 
"has been carried out," although it does not state what phases 
will follow the armed struggle that seeks to change the 
government in the country. 
  "We do not have enough quality weapons to defend ourselves 
without starving. We have only sticks and cunning to face the 
enemy," the rebels state, appealing to the Mexican people to 
join their movement.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 8 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- 
Catholic Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia accepted here today a 
proposal made by the so-called Zapatist National Liberation Army 
to mediate the conflict that has been going on in this 
southeastern region of Mexico since 1 January. 
  "I accept the proposal to serve as a mediator," said the 
bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State, in 
reference to a communique issued by the armed group published by 
the Mexican newspaper LA JORNADA on Saturday. 
  Official reports indicate that nearly 100 people have been 
killed and an undetermined number injured since the armed group 
occupied several towns of the region known as Los Altos de 
Chiapas last Saturday. 
  Bishop Ruiz Garcia talked about "the urgent need to take 
specific steps toward a true consolidation of peace" and said 
that in these times of "sorrow and hope" we must act "with 
responsibility." 
  In the communique the armed group proposed a "public and 
written" dialogue with the government with the mediation of 
Rigoberta Menchu, the Guatemalan Nobel Peace Prize winner, 
Mexican journalist Julio Scherer, director of PROCESO magazine, 
and Ruiz Garcia.

  [Text] Mexico City, 9 Jan (AFP) -- Mexican journalist 
Julio Scherer, director of the PROCESO weekly, today declined an 
invitation from the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) to 
mediate an eventual dialogue with the government. 
  In today's edition of PROCESO, Scherer said: "I appreciate 
the inclusion of my name with those of Bishop Samuel Ruiz and 
Ms. Rigoberta Menchu," the other two persons proposed by the 
EZLN. 
  "However, as a journalist I am committed to impartiality, 
which would be difficult for me to maintain in a double role as 
mediator and reporter of the events we are experiencing," said 
Scherer. 
  "Thus I must exclusively fulfill the rules of my 
profession," 
he concluded. 
  Today Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de Las Casas, 
announced in his homily that he accepted the offer to try to 
mediate the dialogue proposed by the EZLN, whereas the answer is 
yet to come from Menchu, a Guatemalan Indian who received the 
Nobel Peace Price in 1992. 
  In the same edition, PROCESO disclosed that the EZLN had 
asked the three to "respond publicly to our proposal and, if the 
response is positive, mediate in this dialogue between the 
struggling poor people and their hangmen. For that purpose you 
are invited to the EZLN General Command in Lacandona jungle, 
where you will always be well received and protected so you can 
receive our proposals in writing." 
  [Hamburg DPA in Spanish at 2032 GMT on 9 January 94 adds 
that 
Rigoberta Menchu has "confirmed today her willingness to accept 
the role of mediator in the conflict, although she expressed the 
need to first know the responses from Ruiz and Scherer and to 
have guaranteed approval from Mexican President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari."]

  [Text] After stating his disagreement with the measures 
cited 
by Federal District Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez to protect 
Mexico City residents, Mexico City PRD [Party of the Democratic 
Revolution] leader (Rene Bejarano), who believes that the 
measures will restrict the people's freedom of movement, 
announced plans for a large peace demonstration. 
  [Begin (Bejarano) recording] We will march from the 
Revolution Monument to the Zocalo [Mexico City main square] on 
12, 13, or 14 January, and we will hold a large demonstration, 
which will probably be attended by our PRD presidential 
candidate, to demand peace in the country. [end recording] 
  (Bejarano) called the federal district mayor and political 
leaders to an urgent meeting to establish citizen protection 
measures that will not include the use of Army personnel to 
patrol the city. He said that far from calming the people, Army 
patrols will only alarm the public. 
  [Begin (Bejarano) recording] We believe the mayor should 
accept a meeting with political party presidents, social 
organizations, and city government personnel to reach an 
agreement that will impede [words indistinct] further in the 
political climate. [end recording]

  [Text] About 3,000 people belonging to the Independent 
Proletariat Movement [Movimiento Proletario Independiente] 
marched on several Mexico City streets during Friday afternoon, 
7 January. The march began at 1600 in Paseo La Reforma, near the 
Child Heroes Monument in Chapultepec. They walked to Bucarelli 
Street, moving along Juarez Avenue until reaching Maderos Avenue 
and El Zocalo. During their march, they chanted slogans against 
the situation in Chiapas State and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
  About 40 buses were impeded by the group, which blocked 
traffic on the streets and avenues on its path. Mr. Ricardo 
Barco, one of the leaders of the Independent Proletariat 
Movement, said a peaceful agreement between the warring sides in 
Chiapas was necessary. 
  There were also two demonstrations in Mexico city during the 
morning. A group of university professors picketed outside the 
Government Secretariat. With placards and banners, they 
protested the violence in Chiapas and the manipulation of Indian 
groups in the conflict. Afterward, 150 people from the Mexico 
City Neighborhood Assembly demonstrated outside the Televisa 
building on Chapultepec Avenue, demanding clear reportage of the 
events in Upper Chiapas. This group, headed by Marcos Rasconi 
and Javier Hidalgo, members of the Party of the Democratic 
Revolution, marched toward the Government Secretariat, where it 
joined the group of university professors in a rally.

  [Text] Mexico City, 8 Jan (EFE) -- Mexican newspapers today 
reported that the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] is 
using more than 100 people as "human shields," including former 
Chiapas Governor Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, whom it is 
holding hostage in the hamlet of Guadalupe Tepeyac. 
  Reporters from the Mexican newspaper ULTIMAS NOTICIAS said 
EZLN members are using their hostages as shields in case the 
Mexican Army stages an attack to end the Zapatists' violent 
actions. Journalists were able to enter Guadalupe Tepeyac, where 
some 60 families live and which is located approximately 800 
meters from the border with Guatemala in the middle of the 
Lacandona jungle. 
  The newspaper reported that the more than 100 hostages, 
mostly doctors and nurses, are in the hamlet's Social Security 
clinic. The doctors and nurses issued a public letter in which 
they state they "have not suffered any harm" and that they were 
taken hostage on 31 December -- one day before the beginning of 
the armed rebellion which, according to unofficial Mexican 
sources, has killed 200 people.

  [Text] Federal District Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez 
announced during a news conference on 7 January stricter 
security measures for all of Mexico City's public services. 
  [Begin Aguilera recording] Additional measures will be taken 
on a provisional basis. They are aimed at guaranteeing the 
safety of all government facilities in the city. Given their 
characteristics, some of these preventive measures might cause 
some discomfort to the individuals who approach those public 
offices, but we believe it is worthwhile to take a few minutes 
and allow a careful search. [end recording] 
  Aguilera said the electric pylons downed by a group of 
people in Michoacan and Puebla were intended to interrupt Mexico 
City's electricity supply, but this did not happen, thanks to 
the Federal Electricity Commission's intervention, he added. 
  [Begin Aguilera recording] They did not achieve their goal, 
thanks to the timely and efficient intervention of the Federal 
Electricity Commission, and the damage caused to the electric 
pylons did not interrupt the city's electricity supply. [end 
recording] 
  The federal district mayor also said the permanent revision 
and inspection of public facilities will be performed by the 
public offices' own security personnel and will not require the 
Army's support. The federal district mayor said there are still 
no reports that people involved with the armed group, which 
operates in Chiapas State, are in Mexico City. He added: 
Nevertheless, authorities have located some pamphlets and 
printed matter which refer to that armed group. 
  Mr. Manuel Aguilera Gomez said the life of Mexico City's 
residents is continuing as normal, and these security measures 
in public facilities will be of a provisional nature.

telephone that the car bomb planted at a Mexico City shopping 
center early Saturday morning is "the first retaliation against

Gonzalez is currently the government secretary, 
  "This is an anonymous call, write this down quickly," a man 
with a faltering voice said before reading the message. 
  Early this morning a car bomb exploded up in an underground 
parking lot at the Plaza Universidad Shopping Center in southern 
Mexico City. There was extensive damage to some 20 shops, but 
no one was injured. 
  The man who phoned AFP gave no evidence that he was in fact 
a 
member of the EZLN.

  [Text] Mexico City, 8 Jan (AFP) -- The Revolutionary 
Workers Clandestine People's Union Party (PROCUP-PDL) has 
claimed responsibility for a grenade explosion at the Acapulco 
mayor's office this morning, saying it was an act of solidarity 
with the Chiapas rebels, according to a telephone call to AFP 
today. The explosion did not cause any casualties. 
  In addition to the explosion in Acapulco, a car bomb 
exploded 
today in a mall in southern Mexico City, damaging 20 stores but 
causing no casualties. There was also a bomb scare at the 
Secretariat of Roads and Safety, which is responsible for 
security in the capital. 
  The armed clandestine PROCUP-PDL staged actions during the 
eighties, but in 1990 its leader and 90 members were imprisoned 
in the wake of an operation staged after two guards of the 
newspaper LA JORNADA were killed during a skirmish over the 
delivery of a document. 
  In a communique released to AFP, the group expressed support 
for the actions by the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) 
in Chiapas and said that the Mexican Army, "under the counsel of 
U.S. imperialism and exceeding the powers of the union, is 
carrying out a strategy of extermination against the insurgents 
and the people, showing no respect for the Geneva convention." 
  "Breaking the chains of fear with which the bourgeoisie 
attempts to immobilize and subjugate our people, we have taken 
up arms and refuse to allow society to be used as a hostage by a 
military dictatorship wearing a civilian democratic mask, which 
has the Mexican Army as its fundamental pillar," the PROCUP 
states. 
  In an appeal to the "Mexican people," the PROCUP-PDL states 
that "we are at war and join the revolutionary armed struggle 
being waged by the EZLN, our parties, other organizations, and 
revolutionary groups." 
  Authorities have beefed up security measures in Mexico 
City's 
international airport and have ordered a check of vehicles 
entering public parking lots to forestall any attack, according 
to a spokesperson for the terminal area. 
  Airport authorities are constantly checking airport 
terminals 
and pedestrian crosswalks and ordering vehicles that linger more 
than five minutes to drive away. 
  City Mayor Manuel Aguilera on Friday ordered security 
measures to be increased in office and public buildings after it 
was learned that two electricity towers were toppled in the 
neighboring states of Puebla and Michoacan, an act for which the 
EZLN claimed responsibility.

  [Text] Mexico City, 9 Jan (EFE) -- Members of the rebel 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) warned today they will 
soon begin staging attacks in the Mexican capital, but they 
denied their participation in the toppling of two high-tension 
electricity pylons in Michoacan and Puebla, and in an explosion 
at the Federal Palace in Acapulco. 
  According to the Mexican newspaper LA JORNADA, it received a 
telephone call on 8 January from an alleged EZLN member who said 
the rebel group was not involved in the terrorist attacks in 
Michoacan, Puebla, and Acapulco. 
  Nevertheless, the caller said it is very probable that the 
rebel movement, which began the armed uprising in Chiapas on 1 
January, "will detonate explosive devices in the Mexican 
capital." 
  The alleged EZLN member said that the civilian population of 
Mexico City need not be alarmed, "because we will warn the 
police 30 minutes in advance before the explosions." 
  Many newspaper reports attributed the attack in Acapulco and 
in the Plaza Universidad Shopping Center in Mexico City on 8 
January to the extremist Revolutionary Workers Clandestine 
People's Union Party-Poor People's Party (Procup-PDLP). 
According to these reports, members of the extremist party 
claimed responsibility for the attacks in several telephone 
calls in which they said the actions were "to demand that the 
government stop the repression against the EZLN members" and in 
support of the insurrectional movement. 
  LA JORNADA also published a secret report composed by the 
Chiapas government, in which it is said that there are 42 
communities in the state in the conflict zone that are described 
as "high risk" and 13 others in which a special vigilance must 
be established, "because they are highly belligerent." 
  The document stated that Chiapas is experiencing "the most 
dramatic situation of poverty in its history, because the large 
government investments have not been sufficient in comparison to 
the region's needs." According to LA JORNADA, the document 
described one by one the main problems faced by the people of 
Chiapas, such as poverty, illiteracy, a lack of loans, drug 
trafficking, low wages, and others, which make "the region 
fertile ground for the growth of discontent, on which the armed 
group has capitalized." 
  The document also proposed 10 points to resolve the crisis, 
including forgiving the coffee growers and cattle growers' debt, 
having officials respect human dignity, creating subregional 
attention centers, and better definition of agrarian policies. 
  After recounting that the first signs of guerrillas were 
detected in Chiapas 30 years ago, the document read that "the 
emergence of the armed group should not surprise us, because 
since 1973 the existence of centers for guerrilla military 
training and for the recovery of Guatemalan guerrilla wounded 
was already known."

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel Angel Velasquez] </F>
  [Text] Larrainzar, 7 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- People woke up 
warmer this Friday, and the huge mess that appears to be a 
quarrel, armed conflict, or war is beginning to clear up to the 
disbelief of some and the astonishment of others. 
  In San Andres -- according to Mayor Diego Perez Hernandez -- 
between 15 and 20 percent of the population left with the 
rebels. Here we live in 43 communities, he said. "We know they 
left." 
  San Juan Chamula Mayor Domingo Lopez Ruiz said 60 families 
left to join the rebels and that "they will not be allowed to 
return to their community as they have caused disorder." 
  Lopez Ruiz told a group of reporters that there were two 
training camps in Larrainzar, which is near San Juan Chamula. 
One camp is called Vayalemo and Suytic, and the other in a site 
called "La Casa de las Hormigas." He said the people left the 
villages Bautista El Chico, Tres Cruces, Setelton, and Tzotic. 
He added that 15 days before 1 January, a woman by the name of 
Willis Blanca took weapons, people, and food to those training 
camps. 
  Those villages are located some 50 km northwest of San 
Cristobal de las Casas, one of the towns occupied by an armed 
group on 1 January, which prompted the Army's intervention and 
resulted in 100 people being killed in seven days of violence. 
  In Larrainzar the situation is different, however. The mayor 
said that starting tomorrow, Saturday, he will meet with all the 
residents "to decide what will be done because their priority is 
to save lives." 
  The mayor said he was forced to turn over some vehicles and 
some municipal drivers were taken away. He added that "30 or 40 
guerrillas have returned, but no one knows where they are." 
The mayor, a young rural professor, said that the "trucks 
loaded with people" left for San Cristobal de las Casas on the 
night of 31 December. 
  "Some 30 or 40 of them came here, seemingly unarmed. I spoke 
with them for two hours, but when I refused to turn over the 
vehicles they lifted their shirts and showed me their weapons," 
he said. "They told me to give them the vehicles or they would 
kill me. I didn't want to die, so I gave them the vehicles. I 
was told that many of them boarded the vehicles a little farther 
down the road." 
  In San Juan Chamula, just south of Larrainzar, Mayor Lopez 
Ruiz pointed out that even though local residents are unarmed, 
they are so well organized that on 4 January they caught "a spy." 
  "The man seemed suspicious. He was not looking at the road. 
He came here to find out about us. A judge and town councilman 
left in a patrol car to question him," Lopez said. "The man 
said he had no name and that he was from Larrainzar. He later 
said he was coming here to visit a friend but gave no name. He 
then tried to draw a weapon but was arrested," Lopez explained. 
"He was driving a green three-ton truck with a sign on the 
front that read `El Chapulin.' We confiscated his truck, his .22 
caliber Star pistol, two magazines, a license, and a voting 
card," Domingo said. 
  "The man was carrying another card that read: Soviet Union, 
you know where I am. A list of six weapons followed. I only 
remember one of them: rifle .22-16 with the price of 1,700 new 
pesos ($548). 
  "I asked the Army to take him away and General Oton Saldivar 
Carrillo sent me a vehicle. The man's name is Andres Hernandez 
Nunez. We later learned that two houses full of weapons were 
found in Larrainzar. 
  "They are ambitious people. They want the land without 
working for it, through violence. We all know that to have 
something we have to work" We do not believe in violence. 
That is why God gave us the power to speak so we can express 
our needs. Even though I am an authority, I cannot give all the 
orders by myself, I am not a dictator," Lopez added. 
  "Those who left are not going to be forgiven. They caused 
disorder and that is why we could not drive to the city to buy 
fuel, medicine, or anything. The people will not forgive them 
because the people of Chamula can think and can get things done 
through discussion," the San Juan Chamula mayor said.

<F P=106> [Report by Saul Sanchez; from the "Upon Awakening" newscast; </F>
passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Socorro Diaz Palacios, deputy government secretary, 
stated yesterday the government has information on the identity 
of the individuals leading the armed group operating in Chiapas 
State. 
  [Diaz] "Concerning the Mexicans, some are activists 
connected 
to guerrilla groups dismantled in the 1970's." 
  Commenting on leaders who are foreigners, she said they may 
have gotten experience on guerrilla warfare in countries south 
of Mexico. Diaz said the capture of individuals who come from 
that region and their level of training lead to that suggestion, 
saying that a Nicaraguan and, apparently, a Guatemalan are under 
arrest. 
  [Diaz] "The aggressor armed group has received the support 
of certain ideologues and clergymen from different denominations 
that act on their own. They have organized cadres and the 
interiors of their villages, allowing them to go from convincing 
rural residents to recruiting and training them subsequently in 
subversive and terrorist practices." Diaz reported that 
summoning orders are being issued for people allegedly tied to 
these criminal activities. She added that the armed group has 
15 training centers; six of them are located in Las Margaritas, 
five in Ocosingo, two in Sabanilla, one in Altamirano, and one 
in Chanal. 
  [Diaz] "They have regulations and internal discipline, as 
well as different instruction handbooks covering the use of 
weapons, planning of attacks, combat strategies, security and 
communications systems, and disciplinary measures. Procup 
[Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union Party] 
literature was found in their camps, which they support by 
distributing its publications." 
  The rebels accompany their methods to recruit personnel with 
threats to the effect that they will take away properties or 
expel from the community those who are reluctant to join 
criminal activities. The official said there were instances in 
which children were kidnapped to induce their parents to join 
the guerrillas. 
  [Diaz] "Co-opted or pressured groups devote their efforts to 
the building of training centers. These families prepare food 
to meet the needs of this radical and violent group." 
  She added that, based on the information that exists, it is 
believed there are three kinds of operation bases. 
  [Diaz] "They are located in inaccessible terrain, hidden by 
foliage. Reaching those sites requires walking three or four 
hours on partly exposed paths in areas densely vegetated." 
  Militants have been strategically deployed to penetrate all 
of southern Chiapas. When they take control over a region, 
municipal, productive, and educational activities are neglected. 
  [Diaz] "The so-called militia or militant squads operate as 
a 
paramilitary apparatus. Each squad consists of one sergeant, 
one corporal, one radio operator, one health provider, and 20 
militants." These rebels possess .22-caliber rifles, 5.56-mm 
AR-15 rifles, .30-caliber M-1 carbines, and different kinds of 
shotguns, pistols, and revolvers. These weapons are 
manufactured in the United States, the United Kingdom, and 
Russia, and especially used by guerrilla units. Diaz said they 
are operating with sophisticated radio communications equipments. 
  [Diaz] "Their radio communications equipment has between 23 
to 40 transceiver channels, and they operate from 2400 to 0600." 
The official said it has been possible to detect part of their 
key code and record transmissions. 
  [Diaz] "The transmissions base station from the subversive 
general garrison goes by the identification code name of Cicara, 
which apparently stands for the so-called El Caracol Instruction 
Center [Centro de Instruccion El Caracol], located in the town 
by that same name of Las Margaritas." 
  The deputy government secretary said although social demands 
have been met, the subversive groups' operations have increased, 
adding that last year on three occasions Mexican authorities 
learned that aggressor groups were preparing violent actions. 
She acknowledged that authorities acted with unusual calm and 
flexibility. Diaz read a 28-page report prepared with 
information supplied by the National Defense Secretariat and the 
Attorney General's Office. 
  [Diaz] "The so-called Zapatist National Liberation Army is 
an 
extremist, violent, professional, and well-trained organization; 
its profile is highly ideological and uses a language that is 
characteristic of extremist guidelines."

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 8 Jan (DPA) -- Members 
of the Indian communities settled in the mountains near San 
Cristobal de Las Casas are beginning to panic due to operations 
by the Mexican Army to "comb" the area for guerrillas of the 
Zapatist National Liberation Front, EZLN. 
  "Please tell the Army that we are not Zapatists and to give 
us a warning before they bomb the area because we are very 
scared," a group of Chamulas Indians living in the Zontehuitz 
and Tenejapa area, where military actions have concentrated 
during the past 48 hours, told journalists. 
  Although there is no evidence of injuries among the civilian 
population, rockets fired from "Pilatus" planes and shooting 
from tanks and armored vehicles have made that wooded 
mountainous region a veritable inferno for its inhabitants. 
  According to the Defense Ministry, the area was bombed 
during 
the pursuit of 400 EZLN guerrillas who were planning to sabotage 
a microwave tower on Huitepec Hill, a strategic communications 
point in southeastern Mexico. The bombing began at dusk on 9 
December and grew more intensity on the morning of 10 December. 
According to the same source, the rebels managed to damage 
three airplanes and two helicopters. 
  Witnesses said that at least four airplanes, three 
helicopters, 12 tanks, combat vehicles and artillery-equipped 
jeeps participated in the actions, as well as an undetermined 
number of troops, who were transported to the area in 10 trucks. 
  Just as it happened with the settlers in the southeastern 
mountains -- where the communities of Corralito and San Antonio 
Banos, which were also bombed for three days, are situated -- 
the inhabitants of Zontehuitz and Tenejapa told journalists 
they have not seen any guerrillas in that region. 
  According to nongovernmental organizations in San Cristobal, 
the bombings during the first days of the week against areas 
near Corralito, San Antonio Banos, and San Isidro Ocotal, 
southeast of the city, caused more than 2,000 Chamulas Indians 
to flee. 
  These organizations, grouped in an alliance called "Chiltac" 
-- which in the Tzotzil language means "companero" -- said that 
the majority of Indians sought refuge in the same hills so they 
would be near their homes. Only a few have moved to San 
Cristobal for safety. 
  San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz said he has no information 
on the situation in the conflict area because land and telephone 
communications have been cut off. "I have been unable to 
communicate with my pastors or representatives," he said. 
  On Thursday the Army placed a viselike grip on the 
guerrilla's territory in what seemed like the beginning of a 
vast offensive to "clean up" the region following the retreat of 
rebel forces into the mountains. 
  Armored personnel carriers and troops on alert are denying 
access to the area, which is a triangle covering several hundred 
square kilometers with points at San Cristobal de las Casas, 
Ocosingo, and Las Margaritas. 
  During this apparent offensive, the army recovered control 
in 
the majority of the towns previously occupied by the rebels such 
as Huixtan, Oxchuc, and Altamirano without pressure from the 
military. 
  There is no independent information about the fate of the 
civilian population within the triangle of operations, although 
the military command allowed the government's National Human 
Rights Commission to send a representative into Ocosingo 
yesterday. 
  The commission president, Jorge Madrazo, who has been in San 
Cristobal since last Wednesday, asked local and military 
authorities to provide shelters for the refugees immediately.

  [Text] Charged with the infliction of injuries, homicide, 
criminal association, and the use of exclusive Army regulation 
weapons, the Attorney General's Office [PGR] has requested that 
criminal proceedings be brought against Guatemalan Jesus Sanchez 
Galicia. 
  The Guatemalan has admitted to PGR officials that he had 
participated in armed attacks in Tecun and Ocosingo, Chiapas. 
He has confirmed that he had been arrested by Federal Judicial 
Police members at the highway checkpoint at the 
Catahashi-Chiapas crossroad, Tabasco State. Jose Sanchez 
Galicia has revealed that he is a native of Ticul Municipality 
in Guatemala, the country from where he received military 
training. Sanchez has been identified as one of the main 
commanders of the armed groups that are breaking the law in 
Chiapas. He said he is an expert in the handling of automatic 
weapons, pistols, revolvers, and rifles. He has been placed 
under the charge of the district criminal judge in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, Chiapas.

the attempts two days ago by unidentified individuals to down a 
Federal Electricity Commission high-tension electricity pylon, 
located 10 km from Periban, as an isolated incident. 
  Chavez has met with reporters at the State Government House 
and said there is a climate of work, calm, and social peace in 
the state. The governor also denied that dynamite or 
blowtorches were used in the attempt to down the high-tension 
pylon, and he revealed that a fretsaw had been used to cut the 
base of the tower. Chavez added that the sabotage had been 
perpetuated by people who wanted to stand out by following 
examples set in other areas, referring to the events in Chiapas. 
Chavez reported that the high-tension pylon had not been 
damaged and that the electricity supply had not been cut off.

<F P=106> [Report by Antonio Ortega] </F>
  [Excerpt] San Cristobal de Las Casas, Mexico, 9 Jan (AFP) 
-- The Mexican Army today resumed its attacks on guerrillas in 
the conflict areas surrounding Ocosingo and Tenejapa. There was 
artillery fire at approximately 1300 local (1930 GMT) near the 
garrison of the 31st Military Zone, which, according to reports 
that have been neither confirmed nor denied by the Army, has 
been attacked by rebels. 
  A caravan of the "All Rights For All" Organizations Network 
tried to advance toward Tenejapa, and when the military 
prevented their advance in the place known as La Garita, 
explosions were heard in the bush. 
  In the morning, another caravan of the Network tried to go 
to 
Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Oxchuc, where there have been clashes 
between guerrilla and regular forces, but the soldiers 
prohibited the trip. 
  In both cases, personnel in charge of the road blocks said 
traffic was not allowed through because rebel groups are in the 
area and the Army wants to be able to guarantee safety and 
tranquillity before opening the roads. 
  Human rights groups and the media have protested the fact 
that for four days there have been road blocks on the access 
routes to the conflict area, on the road to Comitan, on the road 
from Palenque to Ocosingo, and on other roads where there is 
supposedly a rebel presence. 
  Some reporters believe the authorities have "cordoned off 
the 
media" while they carry out a "clean-up operation at the combat 
sites," because so far the effects of the bombing and shelling 
by the military over the last four days is still unknown. 
  Saturday was apparently a calm day as no shelling or rocket 
explosions were heard, nor were there reports of clashes between 
the Armed Forces and the Zapatista National Liberation Army 
(EZLN), which declared war on the Army on 1 January. [passage

  [Text] Mexico City, 9 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- It was officially 
reported today that at least 97 are dead, an undetermined number

  The National Defense Secretariat also stated in a communique 
that the armed group today, Sunday, fired for the eighth 
consecutive day against the headquarters of the 31st Military 
Zone, 10 km southeast of San Cristobal de Las Casas. 
  This time the members of the self-styled Zapatista National 
Liberation Army [EZLN], which on 1 January occupied several 
towns in Chiapas State, also cut the electricity supply to the 
region, stated the source. 
  According to the communique, 61 members of the armed group 
are dead and an undetermined number are wounded. As for the

capitals of Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, Altamirano, and San 
Cristobal de Las Casas, as well as other towns such as Chanal 
and Morelia, are under military protection. 
  The Army maintains checkpoints in the conflict areas to

de Las Casas, Ocosingo, and Altamirano, the Army is offering 
medical attention, distributing food, and providing attention to

  [Text] "As of today I assume the leadership of the peace 
talks that have resumed in Mexico. For that reason, I have an 
open telephone line with the delegation, because I am directly 
responsible for the peace process," President Ramiro De Leon 
Carpio said in San Gaspar Chajul at the end of the inauguration 
of various projects and the presentation of a contribution to 
the Chajul Val Bak Cuyol Association. 
  "For the past seven months this responsibility was delegated 
to Hector Rosada, and I maintained direct participation. Now I 
will be responsible for the agreements that -- God willing -- 
will lead to the signing of a comprehensive social and economic 
peace," he added. 
  De Leon Carpio said that this was his first statement on the 
topic of talks with the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity]. He also said the governmental delegation in Mexico has 
a specific mission: to establish contacts for a future dialogue. 
  "We hope the established objective will be achieved; in 
other 
words, the establishment of the procedures and mechanisms for a 
future dialogue. They will not undertake an in-depth analysis 
of a specific topic or of the peace plan that the government has 
begun with the national reconciliation," he said.

  [Text] Santiago, 7 Jan (EFE) -- Former Chilean presidential 
candidate Manfred Max Neef said today that the Mexican Indian 
uprising in Chiapas is "fully legitimate." 
  The former environmentalist candidate, who obtained 5.6 
percent of the votes in the elections of 11 December, charged 
that the chiefs of state of the continent react with "hypocrisy" 
to the problems of their indigenous populations. 
  "They praise indigenous liberators, but harm indigenous 
territories by establishing multinational enterprises," Max Neef 
said. 
  According to him, the southeastern Mexican state of Chiapas 
is in an overexploited region of extreme poverty, which has been 
permanently ignored. 
  He added that this type of uprising occurs in the continent 
as a consequence of a system that does not take into account the 
demands and historical rights of indigenous peoples. 
  Meanwhile, a delegation of the Mapuche "All Lands Council" 
movement met 6 January with Mexican Ambassador to Chile Jorge 
Eduardo Navarrete, and asked him to request "an immediate, 
unilateral cease-fire by the Mexican Government" from President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  Dagoberto Cachana, coordinator for the Chilean indigenous 
organization, said that a cease-fire on the part of the Armed 
Forces "will facilitate a negotiations process."

  [Text] Brasilia -- The remarks made by Justice Minister 
Mauricio Correa in an interview with TV Manchete on a coup 
threat, which reportedly was hovering over the country by the 
end of last year, have caused irritation at Planalto Palace. 
President Itamar Franco has forbidden Radiobras [Brazilian Radio 
Broadcasting Company] from retransmitting the interview. The 
retransmission request was made by the justice minister himself 
because, according to him, in his remarks he categorically 
defended the president, even though he may have talked about the 
coup. 
  In a brief statement, President Franco said the minister 
himself is responsible for the remarks he made. Through acting 
presidential press adviser Fernando Costa, the president 
explained that he was informed about the interview by the 
justice minister himself, and declined to comment on the 
statement's content. Correa said Franco had "incentives" to 
impose a coup, as done by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. 
  The Army's spokesman, General Gilberto Serra, said the 
military is not aware of the matter and Army Minister Zenildo de 
Lucena was surprised by those remarks. 
  Gen. Serra said: "We, the military, are democrats. We fight 
for democracy, regardless of the inconveniences it might cause." 
  Correa had difficulties explaining his remarks. He tried to 
minimize the interview's impact, saying that he only felt a 
climate in society favorable to a "Fujimorization of the 
country." 
  He added: "No one had made a proposal in this regard, but we 
knew it existed. People in society felt the desire to see a 
strong hand." 
  Correa's interview on television was clear, however. In 
response to a question on the possibility of a coup if Luis 
Inacio Lula da Silva was elected, he said: 
  "I want to say something extremely serious. President 
Franco, 
who has democratic training and a lofty public spirit, has gone 
through one of the times of greatest turbulence in the country. 
Last year, with the establishment of the CPI [Congressional 
Investigating Committee], low salaries, and the difficulties in 
administration, there were certain incentives toward this 
Fujimorization. I am certain that had the previous government 
that was ousted been in power instead of President Franco, what 
happened in Peru would have taken place in the country: The 
president would have become a Fujimori, a dictator." 
  Correa immediately answered the following question: "Would 
President Franco have the support of the people had he closed 
Congress?" 
  "I think so because the people's indignation is great and 
the 
people want to see immediate results and corruption eliminated."

  [Text] Bolivian economic growth in 1993 continued along the 
same lines as in the last four years -- it was "modest" and 
"insufficient to meet the huge demands of the people." This is 
the opinion voiced on 29 December by the Bolivian Private 
Businessmen Confederation [CEPB] on the behavior of the economy 
during 1993. The CEPB pointed out that this year the Bolivian 
economy followed the same pattern as in previous years. 
  According to the document released to the press by CEPB 
Chairman Carlos del Chazal, the underlying reasons for this 
"modest" growth are the relative stability of prices, and above 
all, the social stability achieved on the basis of dialogue and 
consensus, especially with regard to relations between employers 
and employees. 
  The change of administration in August did not alter the 
economic policy, particularly the monetary policy. One may 
rightly venture to say that in the eyes of Bolivian businessmen, 
1993 was a year without major jolts, in which problems and 
disssatisfactions were expressed by other sectors of Bolivian 
society. 
<H5>  The Damned Fiscal Deficit </H5>
  One of CEPB's concerns was, for example, the steady and 
relentless increase in the fiscal deficit, which is estimated to 
reach 6.5 percent of the GDP by the end of the year. This was 
undoubtedly the largest deficit in four years, since it totaled 
4.6 percent in 1992. The CEPB document stresses that the fiscal 
imbalance was real in spite of the significant and sustained 
increase in tax revenues. CEPB's most serious concern lies in 
the fact that the deficit is financed with foreign resources, by 
running into debt, the level of which cannot be sustained for 
much longer. 
  And yet, what is still more disturbing is that most of 
government spending is earmarked for current expenditures, thus 
curtailing resources and possibilities for public investments, 
both in the development of human resources as well as in the 
upgrading of the productive infrastructure that would enable 
ending "bottlenecks that hinder private productive activities 
from achieving greater dynamism and development." 
<H5>  Policies and Indicators </H5>
  The most salient aspect of the monetary policy furthered by 
the Bolivian Central Bank is the curbing of inflation to levels 
below 10 percent. The exchange rate behaved in a way comparable 
to the controlled inflation pattern. 
  According to the CEPB analysis, these factors contributed to 
the improvement of the real exchange rate for the exporting 
sector. The CEPB contends that "the increase in the country's 
international reserves constitutes another factor that provides 
stability in the short term." 
  Among the most significant events, the CEPB mentioned the 
passing of the new General Law on Banks and Financial 
Establishments, which will enable the establishment of new 
financial institutions to democratize credits and benefit vast 
business sectors, which will in turn be instrumental in creating 
new jobs and wealth. 
  These encouraging accomplishments made by the Bolivian 
economy contrast with some other negative and restrictive 
aspects, like the increasing prevalence of making transactions 
in U.S. dollars and high interest rates. The CEPB believes that 
"the cost of money, together with rules of the game that are not 
altogether clear, conspire against private investments, and 
therefore, against employment and economic growth." 
  The document released by Chazal cites preliminary estimates 
by the National Statistics Institute of a 3.2-percent GDP growth 
due to "opposing behaviors." On the one hand, the dynamism of 
agriculture and the mining industry, and on the other, the slump 
in sectors like the manufacturing industry and construction 
[sentence fragment as published]. 
  With regard to foreign trade, the imbalance continues, so 
much so that it is estimated that the deficit of the 1993 trade 
balance will be as high as in the previous year, i.e. more than 
$500 million. The document states that "we meet our needs by 
resorting time and again to the rest of the world at the expense 
of domestic economic development." 
  The Bolivian businessmen's closing assessment of the 
economic year includes a review of the national economy's 
prospects and projections. The administration must first engage 
in modernizing the state by completing the great structural 
transformations and changes initiated. These transformations 
and changes must be completed with the constitutional reforms. 
These great reforms will redefine the state's role and will 
guarantee effective economic freedom and responsibilities for 
the entrepreneurial segment. 
  Entrepreneurs trust that the fiscal deficit will be reduced 
in 1994, that it will be controlled better, and that it will be 
financed with real resources. 
  This must be achieved without resorting to increased taxes, 
but rather by attempting to increase the number of taxpayers and 
reducing tax evasion. This will prevent the "crowding out" 
[preceding two words in English] phenomenon, "which prevents the 
private segment from making more effective contributions to 
investments." Within the framework of the expected 
modernization and without considering the removal of the powers 
of the state, the entrepreneurs propose the following: 
  -- To transfer the large public enterprises, including the 
deregulation of the markets in which they are operating, thus 
eliminating the harmful public monopolies. 
  -- To reform education, thus allowing our country to have -- 
in the middle and long term -- qualified human resources, the 
basis for any development process. 
  -- To restructure the social security system in order to 
improve the standard of living of the workers through 
appropriate health and housing contributions -- and to reform 
the retirement funds through an individual capitalization 
system, which will also contribute to financing substantial 
investments required to grow at a faster pace and democratize 
the ownership of capital. 
  The Bolivian entrepreneurs emphasize: "We will continue to 
contribute to improving the standard of living of the population 
through the production of wealth and the creation of jobs. This 
process will be more dynamic if the state establishes the 
conditions required to guarantee an increased flow of national 
and foreign investments."

  [Text] China highlighted its problems with the United 
States for the alleged illegal sale of textiles to that country, 
which should be solved through negotiations, and warned that it 
could be forced to give a sharp answer to U.S. reprisals. 
  These statements were made by a spokesman of the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation after Washington 
announced its decision to reduce its purchases from China in the 
specified area by 35 percent. This would include sweaters, 
clothing, cotton products, and elements used in the maintenance 
of machinery: a reduction that exceeds $1 billion, which is 
considered to be a severe blow to bilateral trade transactions 
in the textile sphere.

<F P=106> [Interview with Inter-American Development Bank, IDB, </F>
President Enrique Iglesias in Montevideo; date not given] 
  [Text] [EL PAIS] What is the situation in international 
trade? 
  [Iglesias] The situation remained stable at a 4-percent 
growth rate, and a recovery in the past few years. However, the 
most important issue is the approval of the "Uruguay Round" of 
GATT talks which has finally ended, and which I believe 
represents a very important step forward for the future of 
international trade. 
  I think that the importance of this round of talks is not 
the 
achievement of the goals we wanted, but the achievements 
obtained since the talks began in 1986 in Punta del Este. I 
think the situation is much better, although not as good as we 
would have wished, especially for the developing countries. It 
is very difficult to make progress in this field. The important 
thing is that we currently have a much stronger GATT 
organization in comparison with what it was in the past, and 
consequently we now have an authority controlling trade 
processes. 
  Issues that had been excluded from international talks are 
now part of the negotiations. Progress has been made with the 
incorporation of subjects like agriculture, textiles, and 
services, which constitutes historic progress. 
  I think the round of talks has resulted in considerable 
progress which implies historic change in international trade 
procedures, bringing good perspectives for us. In the 
agricultural field I do not think things are as we wished they 
would be, but there has been considerable improvement in any 
case regarding raw materials. 
  I can see encouraging international trade perspectives due 
to 
the situation in industrialized countries. The United States is 
clearly undergoing a period of recovery, but this is not the 
case in Europe and Japan, the other two great trade engines. In 
general terms the perspectives for international trade are that 
it will continue to improve over the next few years. 
  [EL PAIS] To what extent have your expectations of 1986, 
when 
you helped the GATT talks begin in Punta del Este, been met with 
the conclusion of the Uruguay Round? 
  [Iglesias] It is clear that the objectives we then 
established were very ambitious, and they gave us much harder 
work than we thought. It is also true that had it not been for 
those ambitious goals, we would have not been able to find a 
balance through gains and concessions that allowed us to find a 
negotiating point. 
  Seven years after the talks began it has been demonstrated 
that international trade negotiations are complicated, but it is 
possible to make progress in them. 
  The important issues of the Uruguay Round were two subjects: 
On the one hand we have given a clear signal to restrict the 
extension of protectionism, while on the other hand, at a moment 
when the international situation is slow and full of crisis, the 
news of the GATT results was a good revitalizing shock even in 
some developed countries. 
  [EL PAIS] When do you think that the industrialized 
countries 
will recognize the rights of the countries that produce food and 
raw materials with efficiency, like the members of the Cairns 
Group, including Uruguay? 
  [Iglesias] That is very hard to predict. A step forward has 
been taken which some think is very modest, while others do not 
think so. The momentum to review the issue has begun, but I 
cannot predict anything. 
  [EL PAIS] What are the differences between the progress 
attained in the Tokyo Round of talks (1970) and the Uruguay 
Round? 
  [Iglesias] The important thing is that the customs tariffs 
have dropped further. But more important than that is the 
inclusion of new subjects in GATT, and the strengthening of the 
institutional structure of international trade. I think these 
are the most important and original results, although there are 
other subjects such as the mechanisms to solve controversies. 
  [EL PAIS] Although it may seem early to make this question, 
do you think that a new round of negotiations within GATT must 
take place at some point? 
  [Iglesias] I seriously doubt that a new round of talks 
should 
have to take place in the future. I do not dare to think that 
another round of talks of this kind might take place for many 
years. Some permanent negotiation mechanisms may turn up within 
the new organization that will allow problems to be solved, 
instead of holding these round of talks which imply an enormous 
and unimaginable political effort such as the one made over the 
past seven years. 
  I think that solutions may perhaps be sought through some 
kind of negotiations within the organization that will be 
created, taking into consideration sectors, problems, or 
products. 
  [EL PAIS] What negotiation possibilities will developing 
countries have within this new organization? 
  [Iglesias] For some developing countries, especially those 
that produce food, the results may be harsh, because food prices 
will tend to increase according to this structure. I think that 
countries like ours must continue negotiating. I think the 
Cairns Group has played an important role, as demonstrated by 
the facts. I simply think we must continue struggling in favor 
of international laws in this kind of negotiation. 
  [EL PAIS] What do you think of the economic situation in 
Uruguay? 
  [Iglesias] The country is making necessary economic changes. 
I think that the macroeconomic situation has been wisely 
conducted, and if the international situation does not become 
negative, our prospects for the future, within the current 
terms, are of prudent optimism. 
  [EL PAIS] Uruguayan exporters feel affected by policy 
maladjustments implemented in our country, leading to a drop in 
exports. To what extent do you think the eventual loss of 
competitiveness of our exports and the closing of international 
markets is important? 
  [Iglesias] Our problems have become worse due to the drop in 
prices of some goods, making it more difficult to compete 
abroad, but I think that if we want to be part of an open club 
it is absolutely necessary to go through the stage of adjusting 
ourselves to becoming more competitive. This implies some 
inevitable costs, which must be understood, and we must try in 
as many ways as we can to overcome them. However, if we thought 
all sectors should make profits we would not be recognizing the 
mechanism of the integration process. It is inevitable that 
some sectors should lose while others make a profit. The 
important thing will be that at the end of the road we will all 
be in better shape, and I think we will accomplish that once the 
Common Market of the South [Mercosur] is strengthened. 
  [EL PAIS] What is the situation of the IDB now, during your 
second term as head of the bank? 
  [Iglesias] We have gradually gained the trust of countries 
in 
the north as well as the trust of Latin American countries. We 
have extended our sphere of action. We have improved the 
dialogue with governments and civilian societies. 
  We think the bank has a very special characteristic. Latin 
Americans think of it as something of their own, and they are 
right. This has opened up different possibilities that are not 
covered by other institutions, precisely because of that special 
relation we have with governments, the public, and the private 
sector in general. I envision the future with optimism because, 
in one way or another, the region is beginning to show a 
reaction. 
  We are giving priority to areas we think will be important 
in 
the near future. I can mention two essential areas: support to 
social areas of the economy, something vital in this era when 
reform processes demand renewed action in social programs; and 
support to the private sector. 
  We think it is very important for the bank to continue 
assisting the private sector. We are granting this assistance 
through investment corporations, modestly, but with very good 
results, such as in Uruguay. We want to go a step forward, and 
the board of directors is studying the possibility of loaning 
directly to the private sector, without government guarantees, 
particularly for projects of infrastructure. That would give us 
a new window to work on. It is early to anticipate a result, 
but there are good possibilities. 
  Finally I would say that the big issue worrying me is how to 
support small- and medium-sized enterprises which generally do 
not have access to international financial sources. For me it 
is an objective with a very high priority. 
  [EL PAIS] Has Uruguay efficiently used the resources 
provided 
by the bank? 
  [Iglesias] I think it has used our support efficiently and 
in 
a variety of ways. I am very happy with our image in Uruguay. 
In 30 years the bank has loaned $1.2 billion to the country, 
which in current values must be around $2 billion. We have 
financed programs worth much more than that, because bank 
contributions are only a part of the total program. 
  This strong bank presence has centered in very concrete and 
specific areas, going from physical infrastructure to support 
for economic reform programs. It has covered economic areas 
such as milk or rice production and social areas such as 
education, health, and housing. 
  I think this coverage will continue in the future if the 
bank 
can expand its capital base, as we all think it will. 
  [EL PAIS] What are the possibilities for obtaining 
assistance 
for the Plan III of Municipal Works that was presented by Juan 
C. Raffo, transport and public works minister, and National 
Mayors Congress President Sergio Chiesa in Washington last 
October? 
  [Iglesias] The bank has financed many sanitary and drinking 
water programs in Uruguay over the past 30 years. We think our 
assistance to Montevideo is very important, because Montevideo 
has half the population of the entire country. It is a joint 
effort by the national government and City Hall. 
  We have done very well with Sanitary Plans I and II, which 
are currently being implemented. I do not foresee any problems 
for Plan III, or even Plan IV, which will complete the entire 
network of Montevideo's sanitary infrastructure. With the 
implementation of all these plans I think Montevideo can 
rightfully aspire to becoming one of the most decontaminated 
cities in Latin America. 
  [EL PAIS] What importance will the regional and subregional 
groups -- such as Mercosur, NAFTA (Mexico, the United States, 
and Canada), and those that have been reached in Central America 
and the Caribbean -- have? 
  [Iglesias] I am in favor of those groups. I think it is a 
new form of integration in Latin America. This is an open and 
competitive integration. We are not resorting to the kinds of 
closed mechanisms we had in other times. 
  I think we must say that the new Latin American philosophy 
of 
integration is not achieved in sacrificing the overall 
relationship, but on the contrary, by strengthening it through a 
general improvement of efficiency in the countries. 
  I believe that with that pragmatic and open idea the 
subregional treaties have demonstrated that they are developing. 
I am very impressed with the progress achieved by Colombia and 
Venezuela, the latest developments within Mercosur, the new 
frontiers that are being opened in Central America. It is 
important to continue along that line. 
  The agreement among Mexico, the United States, and Canada is 
a historic event in hemispheric relations, and I think it has 
strengthened these regional mechanisms, which have become more 
necessary than ever. I think this because somehow, in 
negotiating possible membership in NAFTA, the fact that we are 
participating as a group of countries facilitates negotiations, 
and makes the agreement more feasible. 
  NAFTA opens a new opportunity to the hemisphere, and 
beginning from there it strengthens the very subregional 
integration schemes on which we must insist. 
  [EL PAIS] How do you view the development of Mercosur after 
some of the difficulties that have emerged, and which have not 
been fully overcome, in 1993? 
  [Iglesias] I think the structural problems prompted by these 
integration schemes emerge when the countries are not yet in the 
same situation. These differences in the macroeconomic 
situations prompt difficulties and problems such as that of the 
common import tariff. 
  But I would dare to say that in many aspects these 
difficulties were avoidable. The political will is very strong, 
and I can see it everywhere, and that is essential. 
  [EL PAIS] How long does Mr. Iglesias believe he will remain 
as president of the IDB? 
  [Iglesias] It depends first on the contract I have with the 
bank, which expires in four years. It will also depend on 
whether the governments want me to continue to head this 
institution, and of course it depends also on the will of God, 
who has something to do with this business. 
  [EL PAIS] Have you considered any other future activity once 
you conclude your term in office? 
  [Iglesias] No. My desire is to return to Uruguay, but by no 
means have I thought what to do during that "century ahead," 
which means the next four years in the life in which we're 
living. 
  [EL PAIS] Would you be a minister again in a Uruguayan 
government? 
  [Iglesias] Look, I have no answer to that question. All the 
options of my life are open, but for the time being my only 
concern is basically to try to fulfill the objectives I have set 
to see to it that, with the help of God, I might complete a 
decade in the bank to do what I have proposed to do. 
  [EL PAIS] The planned economies have fallen, while 
neoliberalism prevails. It is said that no alternative has been 
found to this doctrine. What do you think? 
  [Iglesias] Look, I think it would take a long time to answer 
that question. Each person interprets neoliberalism very 
differently, so the first thing I would ask is how do you define 
neoliberalism, and then I would offer my understanding of it. 
  I think the experience of the past few years has 
demonstrated 
that there are important limits to state voluntarism, and that 
there are limits to be imposed on the people, starting from 
above. 
  Therefore, if we understand neoliberalism in this manner, I 
agree with it. Now, if what we understand by neoliberalism is 
simply that the forces of the market can play without any type 
of state presence or control as guardian of public interests, or 
that the responsibilities inherent to an appropriate function 
are not assumed, I would say that I do not agree with it.

  [Text] Retired General Rafael Rivas has taken control of 
the Disip [Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services] 
at the request of President-elect Rafael Caldera. Rivas said 
that after having devoted time to private life and performing 
the duties inherent to his post as chief of the National Guard 
5th Regional Command, he is returning to public life to fight 
crime. The general said he fully agrees with the major changes 
the country requires to become an exemplary nation and that he 
has no doubt that difficult work lies ahead. He will even have 
to improve Disip's public image. He is aware of the difficult 
times facing Venezuela and says he will make a huge effort to 
perform the duties he has as a citizen of a nation that needs 
him. 
  [Begin Rivas recording] I will try to wage a straightforward 
struggle against crime, to be loyal to President Rafael Caldera, 
and to strongly defend democracy and its institutions. I will 
do my best to reach the primary goals, and above all, I will 
work hard, especially in creative endeavors. I will work as 
part of a team. We have good workers. As in every other 
organization, we will reorganize what must be reorganized and 
will leave untouched the good things we have. We have a very 
good technical team. [end recording] 
  The new Disip director said his goal is not to fire workers 
indiscriminately but to work hard. He will also respect human 
rights but will be tough on crime.

<F P=106> [From the "Panorama" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, chairman of the National 
Comission for Human Rights [Comision Nacional de los Derechos 
Humanos -- CNDH], who is in Chiapas State, has begun to receive 
complaints of alleged civil rights violations filed by the 
residents of San Cristobal de las Casas and other towns. He 
said all complaints will be investigated, including the case of 
corpses found in the city of Ocosingo with signs of having been 
tortured. The corresponding autopsies have already been 
requested. Madrazo Cuellar indicated CNDH's goal is precisely 
to ensure respect for the human rights and lives of the civilian 
population. 
  [Correspondent Juan Carlos Santoyo] While the Catholic 
Church 
says that strife in Chiapas has entered a phase that may end the 
fighting, the CNDH, through its Chairman Madrazo Cuellar, 
acknowledged the situation in this area of Chiapas State is 
still abnormal and tense. Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal 
de las Casas, clearly stated: I am not responsible for those who 
come to preach as Catholic Church ministers in Indian regions. 
After saying that whole familes have begun to flee the fighting 
and hunger in different towns in upper Chiapas, he reaffirmed 
the Catholic Church's willingness to open the doors of temples 
to let in refugees and even rebels who lay down their weapons or 
are wounded. 
  He was asked very clearly: Does the danger exist that once 
the conflict is over there will be widespread violations of 
Indians' human rights? This is his reply: 
  [Begin Ruiz recording] The danger that arbitrary action may 
occur during a second phase exists. For that reason, I think 
the CNDH, with which we specifically discussed this second 
phase, constitutes for the people a very important element so 
that the largest number of human rights organizations may 
observe the situation. These groups also provide help through 
the participation of foreign observers, who may not be directly 
involved because they are not Mexicans but clearly constitute a 
guarantee that definite steps are taken to avoid human rights 
violations. The peril exists, and the CNDH -- this is also the 
view abroad -- will provide a certain degree of security. We 
are confident this phase will be conducted in the most proper, 
reasonable, and due manner. [end recording] 
  [Santoyo] The bishop added the time has also come to put the 
conflict into the hands of civilians and let the Army out of it. 
He also said refugee centers have opened in Palenque, 
Villahermosa, and Campeche, at which the people fleeing the 
clashes are slowly arriving. After meeting with Bishop Ruiz in 
his office, the CNDH chairman noted that one indication that the 
army has acted in accordance with the law is that civil rights 
have not yet been suspended. 
  The National Indian Institute announced the implementation 
of 
different projects and programs to support Indian communities 
all over Chiapas. It added that priority will be given to 
prevent outside or foreign influence in the actions and 
traditions of our countr's Indians from undermining the 
tranquillity and social peace that reigns in this area.

  [Text] Quito -- The Latin American Human Rights Association 
[ALDHU] has called on the Mexican Government not to implement 
scorched earth or ethnic cleansing policies to deal with the 
current violent situation in Chiapas State, Mexico. The Mexican 
state, one of the most powerful in Latin America, has enough 
operational and military instruments to resolve this situation 
without having to resort to scorched earth or ethnic cleansing 
policies, according to Chilean Juan de Dios Parra, executive 
secretary of the ALDHU. 
  The expression scorched earth refers to the use of intense 
military bombings to eliminate all traces of human, animal, and 
plant life in a specific area. Ethnic cleansing refers to the 
elimination of a certain race. 
  Parra also added that the peasant rebellion of the past six 
days in Mexico is doomed to failure and that more than 500 
people have been killed, most of them innocent civilians. 
According to ALDHU spokesman Cesar Mosquera, the figure of 500 
dead was obtained by the organization after telephone 
conversations with Mexican human rights organizations. Official 
figures from Mexico have only reported the killing of 102 people 
even though Catholic Church sources in Mexico estimate the 
number of people killed could reach 400. 
  Clashes between the Mexican Army and peasants from the 
so-called Zapatista National Liberation Army have been going on 
since 1 January.

  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] In less than four hours, the 
parliamentarians of the 45th legislature will be returning to 
the Parliament in order to see if they can untangle the 
political crisis. Today will mark the opening of the seventh 
session of the 45th legislature. After more than three months 
of vacation, extended by the chronic absenteeism of some 
parliamentarians, there is more suspense and doubt about whether 
today's session will succeed. The stakes are considerable 
because the session, which should be held today, 10 January, is 
aimed at meeting a constitutional requirement, according to the 
latest statements by National Assembly President Firmin 
Jean-Louis. However, since September 1991 the unforeseeable has 
become the rule of the game; everything, including the concerns 
of the 18 January 1993 parliamentarians, has become a series of 
situations outside the 1987 Constitution. 
  During a news conference held on 7 January, Senator Firmin 
Jean-Louis asked those who were elected on 18 January 1993 not 
to execute their threats to return to Parliament. He added that 
the return of the 18 January representatives will have a lot of 
incalculable consequences on the good functioning of the 
parliamentary institution. 
  Contacted by our station, Sen. Dejean Belizaire, leader of 
the controversial parliamentarians, said that he maintains his 
stand. He told Signal Radio that all the 18 January 
parliamentarians would participate in the reopening of the 
parliamentary work that will take place today. [passage omitted] 
Sen. Belizaire concluded that the Parliament has never been 
more abnormal than during the time when the 18 January 
parliamentarians decided to temporarily stand aloof. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Guy Ellis] </F>
  [Text] Castries, St. Lucia, 10 Jan, CANA -- The bankrupt 
St. Lucia Banana Growers Association (SLBGA) is being replaced 
by a new organisation to manage the affairs of the banana 
industry, Prime Minister John Compton has announced here. 
  Compton, in a nationwide radio and television broadcast at 
the weekend, said the board was bankrupt, owing "practically 
every creditor," and was beyond restructuring. 
  He said a government-appointed committee was currently 
working on designing a structure for the organisation. The 
committee's proposal would be presented to the government before 
month-end, he added. 
  Further, he said government would also meet with banana 
farmers as soon as possible, to discuss the proposal and get 
their views on creating the new organisation. 
  The banana industry has been facing problems in recent 
months 
with low market prices and the declining value of the British 
pound sterling. This has severely reduced farmers' returns on 
their production. 
  These problems acted as a catalyst for a three-day strike by 
farmers here last October. The farmers were calling for 
increased prices for their fruit and the disbandment of the 
slbga board, among others grouses. 
  After the strike, the board was dissolved by government and 
replaced by another interim board. 
  Since then, the SLBGA, has been supporting prices to the 
tune 
of hundreds of thousands of dollars (one EC dollar - 37 cents 
US) weekly, but SLBGA officials says the support cannot continue 
indefinitely. 
  The prime minister also indicated that government had made 
arrangements with the St Lucia Agriculturists Association, to 
import fertilisers and other inputs to facilitate the production 
of bananas here. 
  Referring to the strike, Compton called for "peace and 
order" 
in the industry, saying: "We will not survive if we fight 
amongst ourselves". 
  "Our battle is not in the banana fields or on the roads of 
St 
Lucia but in the external market and in this battle all our 
resources must be directed," Compton said. 
  He called for a concerted effort to revitalise the industry, 
noting that farmers must become more efficient and increase 
output, while banana workers needed to give farmers an honest 
day's work. 
  And he called on geest industries, which markets the 
island's 
fruit overseas, to reduce its costs both here and in the UK to 
enable farmers to get better returns on their investments. 
  He noted that since last September, the value of the pound 
sterling had dropped by about 25 per cent. 
  In addition, with the opening up of the European market to 
allow more Latin American bananas onto the market, St Lucia and 
the other Windward Islands banana-producing countries have lost 
much of the protection which the British government had given 
them since they started producing bananas in the mid 1950s. 
  Compton reported that the SLBGA's total debt was in excess 
of 
EC33 million dollars (one EC dollar; 37 cents US) and was 
spending EC1 million every week more than it received. "Its 
major creditors are threatening to put it into liquidation. 
This cannot go on," he said. 
  If the government failed, he said, in acting to restructure 
the industry, it would be destroyed and the economy of St Lucia 
would also collapse. "We must therefore work to create a 
completely new organisation which is capable of responding to 
the needs of farmers in the efficient marketing of their fruit," 
he said.

  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 10 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad 
and Tobago's attorney general Keith Sobion said Sunday 
government will not be pressured into making a decision on a 
land dispute with the Jamaat al Muslimeen. 
  Leader of the Muslimeen, Yasin Abu Bakr, who led the 1990 
coup attempt on a former government here, said Friday his 
organisation had suffered "injustices" at the hands of the state 
and would not sit idly by should the appeal court not deliver 
judgement on the land dispute. 
  In a statement following a strongly-worded warning by the 
commissioner of police, Sobion said government was committed to 
the rule of law, and fully respected the role and function of 
the judiciary. 
  "It will not be party to any attempt to subvert the rule of 
law or indeed to manipulate the judiciary. Moreover, the 
government is confident that the judiciary will not itself 
rebuff any attempt, whether by the government or otherwise, to 
subvert or manipulate its processes. Any suggestion to the 
contrary is patently groundless. The government itself will not 
be pressured into making any decision relating to this matter," 
he said. 
  Sobion noted that there were essentially two issues relating 
to the lands at Mucurapo Road, in the northern township of St. 
James. The first is about the status of persons living there, 
and [the other] is the liability of the state for the demolition 
of certain buildings shortly after the end of the six-day siege. 
  Following a press conference called by Bakr, Commissioner of 
Police Jules Bernard condemned the statements as threats, saying 
the police were ready to deal with anyone who threatened to 
disturb the peace.

  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 7 Jan, CANA -- Trinidad and 
Tobago's former national security minister, John Donaldson, has 
been appointed non-resident ambassador to Korea. 
  Foreign Affairs Minister Ralph Maraj said Donaldson will be 
based in Port of Spain, as economic constraints have forced 
government to increase the number of non-resident ambassadors 
where diplomatic postings in faraway countries were concerned. 
  "I'm optimistic that being able to be in closer contact with 
the cabinet and the government, a non-resident ambassador will 
be better positioned to deepen relations ... And will prove more 
productive than what existed before," he said. The minister also 
said that a delegation of Korean businessmen was expected in 
Trinidad for a trade fair in April.

<F P=106> ["Message" to the nation by Salvadoran President Alfredo </F>
Cristiani; place not given; from a "Special Program" presented 
by the National Communications Secretariat -- live] 
  [Text] Beloved fellow Salvadorans, now that we have begun 
a new year I would like to take advantage of this occasion to 
wish you all the best in 1994 on behalf of Margarita, our 
children, and myself. May this year bring you well-being and 
prosperity. 
  At year's end each of us has an opportunity to think, to be 
with our families, and to examine our past, present, and future. 
With the internal peace fostered by the Christmas season, which 
allows us to reflect -- which I am certain we all did -- I 
thought of my almost five years in office and examined where I 
came from, where I am, and where I am headed. 
  As the end of my term approaches, I could not help but 
recall 
the situation that existed in 1989. We had an armed conflict 
that was causing bloodshed throughout the breadth and length of 
our country, bringing grief and sorrow to the Salvadoran family. 
We were a polarized society and sectors confronted one another. 
What is even worse, there was a considerable uprooting of 
people. Many Salvadorans had to go abroad in search of peace 
and a way to make a living. 
  We had an economic situation that could have been 
characterized as chaotic. During the eighties, which we now 
describe as the lost decade, our country gradually sank further 
into an economic abyss. The crisis returned us to the levels 
that existed in 1960 which, of course, meant higher levels of 
unemployment and poverty. El Salvador also had problems abroad 
because it was identified by its violence and by bad things, not 
as a country that could participate in international meetings or 
present itself with dignity and respect. In 1989, my friends, 
our country was immersed in desperation. 
  When I first addressed you on 1 June 1989, I identified two 
key issues as the main focuses of my government: The first was 
to resolve the armed conflict and the second was to correct the 
chaotic economic situation that prevailed. I chose these two 
key issues because if we failed to resolve them it would be very 
difficult to resolve the country's other problems. Devoting the 
entire national budget to a military effort left no resources to 
resolve such problems as health, housing, and education. 
Likewise, with the economic crisis it was impossible to 
generate jobs and resources to invest in social projects. Thus, 
it was necessary to emphasize these two issues. It was the only 
way to overcome the obstacles that were hindering the solution 
of the country's problems. This is why I made this huge effort. 
  As I recall these past four and a half years, I believe it 
would be worth our while to weigh the current situation. At 
present, our country is no longer at war. Instead, it is 
increasingly consolidating a peace process and has become an 
example to the entire world. All of the sectors in our country 
understand that the mechanism of dialogue prevents 
confrontations and is the best way to resolve our problems. 
  For the first time in El Salvador's history, all of the 
country's many ideological trends will participate in an 
election, which means that we are consolidating our democracy. 
Also at present, our economy is healthy and stable, which opens 
the possibility of investing in that which a government should 
invest in: social projects. 
  Although there are numerous examples, suffice it to say that 
already we have tripled the public health budget and doubled the 
education budget. In short, we are now able to resolve the 
problems that are affecting the Salvadoran people. Within the 
framework of a stable economic situation, considerable 
confidence has been generated domestically and abroad. This 
confidence is fostering investment in our country which, in 
turn, generates new sources of employment; and employment is the 
best way to pull a person out of extreme poverty. 
  Internationally, El Salvador is viewed throughout the world 
as an example of pacification and democracy. However, beyond 
politics or political openness we now also have economic 
openness. All of the worldwide financial centers have opened 
their doors to El Salvador because they believe in and have 
confidence in our country's responsible economic efforts. This 
will allow us to rebuild all of the destruction generated by the 
armed conflict. Now, every Salvadoran can dream of the future; 
now, our children have space to work and grow; now, El Salvador 
has a future. 
  However, looking beyond our accomplishments, we should 
consider who is responsible for this very significant change. 
There can be no other conclusion but that all of it is thanks 
to your support, the support of the entire Salvadoran 
population, a people who decided on a peace process to rescue 
the nation. We must remember that our country was torn between 
a military solution and a political solution. When I took 
office, I chose one of these two options: the political 
solution. I was certain that it was the only solution that 
would be truly lasting and permanent. As of that moment, 
differences disappeared and I was able to rely on the Salvadoran 
people's support to successfully culminate the negotiations 
process which, in 1992, brought us the peace we so desired. 
  In the area of economics, I remember that once during a 
message to the nation I said I had two alternatives with which 
to deal with our difficult economic situation. I could either 
take the easy way out and continue ruling the country with 
methods that would create apparent solutions, or I could make 
the responsible decision to execute actions that would attack 
the problem at its roots, although I knew this decision implied 
high costs and sacrifices. At that time I likened the economy 
to a seriously ill patient at death's door, to whom we could 
administer morphine to diminish his pain but who would 
eventually die. The other alternative was to make the 
responsible decision to perform surgery which, although painful 
and with a slow recovery, would allow the patient to survive and 
regain his health. 
  It was necessary to make the sacrifice for the sake of a 
better future for our country and to ensure the possibility of 
having El Salvador prepared to take off economically and 
prepared to grow. 
  My brother Salvadorans, through these thoughts I have 
confirmed that you, that all Salvadorans, are unquestionably our 
country's greatest wealth, because without your support I would 
never have been able to eliminate the obstacles that prevented 
us from resolving our problems. I know that we still have 
problems, but a country always has them and they must be 
resolved. Nevertheless, by eliminating obstacles, our problems 
are already being resolved. 
  We are now in a position to resolve our problems because the 
government has more resources and they are no longer devoted to 
an armed conflict or demagogic policies, but to those issues to 
which the nation's efforts should be directed: the effort to 
ensure all Salvadorans' success and to provide them with safety, 
education, health, and the necessary opportunities to succeed. 
  We must make El Salvador a country of opportunities. 
Therefore, we must have confidence in our country; we must have 
confidence in our peace process; we must have confidence in all 
of our democratic institutions, which provide us with freedom. 
We must continue to have confidence in our development and in 
our progress as a people. 
  Beloved fellow Salvadorans, we must have confidence in El 
Salvador because I am certain that together, all of us together, 
we will achieve what we have always desired: an El Salvador with 
peace, progress, and freedom. May God bless you all and may He 
always bless our beloved El Salvador. Thank you very much and a 
very good evening to all.

<F P=106> [From "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Everything seems to indicate that the internal 
conflict Mexico has been experiencing over the past week was the 
main reason behind explosions that occurred in Guatemala City on 
Sunday evening. 
  At approximately 2145, two leaflet bombs [bombas 
panfleteras] 
exploded a few seconds apart near Espana Plaza. One of the 
bombs went off at a Mexican restaurant located accross the 
street from the plaza and the other at the Mexican Consulate in 
this capital. In the incident at the consulate, the bomb was 
hurled at the building from 13th Street in Zone 9, between 
Reforma Avenue and 7th Avenue. Both explosions caused great 
damage, particularly the bomb at the restaurant, as you can see 
in this film clip made by the Municipal Firemen's Public 
Relations Department. 
  The link between these incidents and the internal conflict 
in 
Mexico became evident with the dissemination of leaflets with 
phrases such as: Let us back the Zapatists! Viva Bishop Samuel 
Ruiz! Long live the Indian movement! Viva Andres Giron! 
  The other side of the sheet read: Viva Menchu! The sheet 
also bore the letterhead of the Peasant Unity Committee [Comite 
de Unidad Campesina -- CUP]. 
  A few days ago, a similar attack was carried out in downtown 
Mazatenango. Nevertheless, popular organizations are 
categorically rejecting any link between Guatemalan popular 
groups and the Mexican guerrillas. They say claims of such 
links are resulting from a clumsy manipulation of the Mexican 
problem.

  [Excerpt] Guatemala City, 10 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- The 
Guatemalan Government today condemned the attack carried out by 
unidentified individuals on the Mexican Consulate in Guatemala 
City and offered security to the personnel and the installations. 
  Guatemalan Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso told 
the 
media that the government rejects the use of terrorism as a 
political weapon and warned that those responsible will be 
tracked down and "severely" punished. "Terrorism is a crime 
that is punished by Guatemalan laws and the international 
treaties to which Guatemala is signatory to," Ortiz said.

  [Text] Mexico City, 10 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- It was reported 
here that the Guatemalan Government and guerrillas agreed here 
today to continue discussing the topics agreed in Mexico as part 
of restarting the peace process in that Central American 
country, which was suspended last year. 
  The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) and the 
government headed by President Ramiro De Leon Carpio will 
continue to discuss the topic of human rights at a meeting 
scheduled for the second half of February. Sources close to the 
negotiations told NOTIMEX that the delegations agreed to restart 
the discussion of the agenda of Mexico, which contains 
substantive and operative topics whose discussion precedes the 
signing of a peace agreement. 
  The agenda includes the analysis of substantive topics such 
as the human rights situation, economic-social and 
technical-cultural aspects, the problem of land ownership, 
displaced population, and the constitutional reforms. The 
operative topics regard the cease-fire, the demobilization of 
the rebels, and their integration into legal life, according to 
the same sources. 
  The parts also agreed to ask the Episcopal Conference to 
appoint Rodolfo Quezada, bishop of Zacapa, as president of an 
assembly of civilian sectors that would ratify all the 
agreements reached by the government and guerrillas. 
  Another one of the agreements reached today was the 
appointment of UN representative Jean Arnault as coordinator of 
the five days of discussions and mediator and overseer of the 
negotiation process. The URNG and the Guatemalan Government 
began on 6 January at a hotel in the Mexican capital preliminary 
meetings convoked by the United Nations to discuss and frame 
agreement to allow restarting the peace negotiations. 
  The signing of the agreement is scheduled for 1230 local 
(1830 GMT) on 10 January. 
  The Government Commission was headed by Hector Rosada and 
was 
made up by Antonio Gonzalez Taracena, deputy chief of staff of 
the Army; Victor Argueta, commander of the "Honor Guard" 
military base; and Victor Ventura, director of the technical 
school. The Government Commission also included Maximiliano 
Kestler, Mario Permuth, Antonio Arenales, and Victor Viteri. 
  The URNG delegation was made up by Commanders Pablo 
Monsanto, 
Gaspar Ilom, and Rolando Moran, as well as members of the 
Political-Diplomatic Commission: Luis Becker, Miguel Angel 
Sandoval, and adviser Vinicio Castaneda. 
  UN Under Secretary General Marrack Goulding also 
participated 
in the discussions.

insurrection which this group started against the Mexican 
Government in Chiapas State. 
  "It would be controversial to play a role in a neighboring 
state's problem when I have not done it in my own country," 
Menchu said at a news conference, where she deplored the fact 
that the Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity (URNG) have not asked her to mediate. 
  Menchu said she was expressing her view on this matter 
because of the expectations that had been raised concerning the 
EZLN proposal, although, she stressed, the request to mediate 
was not made officially in a written document.

<F P=106> [Report by Hermes Sucre Serrano] </F>
  [Text] The ruling parties' alliance failed because it is 
made up of parties that have united for "electoral" purposes 
with the sole objective of grabbing a slice of the "government 
pie", said Ernesto "Toro" Perez Balladares, presidential 
candidate for the opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party 
(PRD). 
  Perez Balladares said the ruling parties have no interest in 
meeting the people's needs. On the contrary, the only thing 
that unites them is their desire to continue taking advantage of 
public finances. 
  "We don't lose any sleep over alliances because we are 
interested in sharing our government platform with political 
parties and organized groups that are interested in serving the 
people," the PRD leader said. 
  The PRD presidential candidate made those statements 
yesterday during a morning radio talk show hosted by radio 
commentator and journalist Mario Velasquez. 
  Perez Balladares recalled that alliances were created by 
former liberal leaders to oppose the candidacy of former 
president Arnulfo Arias Madrid. 
  "One party would split into many groups to get more 
representatives at the polling table, thus making it true that 
whoever counted the votes would decide who wins," he added. 
  Regarding the role that the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) 
will play in the May 1994 elections, Perez Balladares said the 
Christian Democrats turned out to be a failure because they are 
not fit to rule, only "to be among the fallen" opposition. 
  Referring to the Papa Egoro Party and Ruben Blades' 
candidacy, the PRD leader said Blades is a capable man with good 
intentions but he lacks political experience. "They are on the 
right track. They have a meaningful movement that is critical 
of the status quo, but they lack political realism," he added. 
  Regarding the renegotiation of military bases proposed by 
Ruben Carles, Perez Balladares said such a negotiation is 
unnecessary, because the U.S. people are not even interested in 
remaining in Panama.

  [Text] The Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement 
(Molirena) legislative faction has proposed the formation of an 
alliance among all parties that have a democratic and civic 
vocation, but without "suicidal stubbornness and 
pseudo-ideological positions," in order to form a presidential 
ticket "with the most capable and qualified people." 
  In a news conference held at the Legislative Palace 
yesterday, Molirena legislators released a communique warning 
that their proposal "must be implemented urgently because 
Panamanian democracy is dying and disintegrating with every 
passing minute." 
  Molirena faction spokeswoman Gisela Chung said the Molirena 
legislators' call to unity is to th e Christian Democratic 
Party, the new parties, and the civic forces that fought for 
democracy. Chung said the civic forces reached an agreement at 
the assembly level, but, unfortunately, the same has not been 
done yet at the leadership level among the ruling parties. 
  According to Chung, the people are surprised at how little 
ability the parties have for a constructive dialogue and 
effective understanding to reach the unity which will prevent 
the military's return through the civilians, who backed the 
cruel dictatorship for many years. 
  "It is not possible therefore that a presidential ticket of 
the democratic forces cannot be formed because of intransigent 
and haughty positions, senseless self-deception, inappropriate 
arrogance, and petty shortsightedness," Chung noted. She said 
the country's legislators are even willing to give up personal 
political aspirations and added that they are urging party 
leaders to contribute.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Jan (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
today blamed the appearance of the self-styled Zapatista 
National Liberation Army (EZLN) in the southern Mexican state of 
Chiapas on "the presence of many mercenaries and professional 
subversives." 
  He also denied the charges pressed by six Mexican human 
rights organizations of the alleged genocide of civilians, 
wondering "what could be done if when subversion takes to arms, 
those who are killing people are said to be preserving human 
rights." 
  "Our interpretation is the same we had for the subversion in 
Argentina, even though the situation is not similar and has 
deeper connotations, such as the ethnical side. In Argentina, 
subversion tried to reach power after the declaration of 
liberated zones such as that in Tucuman," the president said. 
  In a conversation with journalists accredited to Government 
House, Menem said the situation in Mexico was not "improvised, 
because even if at the beginning it appeared to be something 
unplanned, it was later seen that the EZLN was well organized." 
  The president admitted that "displeasure" is the main reason 
for the creation of subversive organizations that "take 
advantage of this to engage in something broader, which does not 
meet the people's demands and which upsets legal order."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Jan (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
announced today that Argentina will remove the mines left in the 
Malvinas Islands after the past South Atlantic war, but the UK 
will pay for the work. 
  The president made these remarks the same day that Vice 
Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella announced that negotiations 
instrumental to the mines' removal "might begin after the 
islands' council informs the UK Government" of the Argentine 
proposal. 
  The announcement that the Argentine Government had made an 
offer to the United Kingdom to sweep the mines left in the 
archipelago after the 1982 war caused a strong controversy with 
regard to who would finance the operation. 
  Menem said today: "It has been established that Argentina 
will remove the mines, but the UK will pay for it." During a 
casual chat with journalists accredited to Government House, he 
added: "The work might cost about $5 million."

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Miguel Alfaro from Las Condes Clinic in </F>
Santiago -- live] 
  [Text] President-elect Eduardo Frei-Ruiz Tagle underwent 
surgery this morning. The operation, which was a surprise for 
many, had been planned for weeks. 
  [Passage indistinct] state of health of President-elect 
Eduardo Frei who was operated on this morning. Among them are 
Commander Angel Izurieta, aide-de camp of President Aylwin; UDI 
[Independent Democratic Union] Secretary General Domingo 
Arteaga; and Interior Minister-designate German Correa. The 
following is an updated report by our colleague Silvia Arteaga: 
  [Begin recording] [Arteaga] Yesterday, when Senator Frei 
closed the seminar on Humanism and Democracy, nobody imagined he 
had planned to be admitted into Las Condes clinic to be operated 
on for an inguinal hernia on his right side which had been 
bothering him for the past few months. 
  [Doctor Sergio Vaisman] This kind of pathology is, in 
general, light and not very painful, which allowed him to lead a 
relatively normal life. In fact, the senator went through his 
whole presidential campaign with minor pain, but he knew he had 
to undergo surgery and that is why it was scheduled for today. 
  [Arteaga] The operation, performed by Doctor Juan Reyes, 
began today at 07:30 this morning. It lasted less than an hour. 
Only his team, who accompanied him since early in the morning, 
and his close aides knew about the surgery. 
  This morning Frei was visited by Senator Mario Papi, a 
future 
member of his cabinet, and Deputy Andres Palma. The doctors 
believe the president-elect will be back to his normal routine 
in 7 or 10 days. [end recording] 
  It is thought that President-elect Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle 
will remain in Las Condes clinic for three days. The next 
medical bulletin,the second of the day, will be released today 
at 1730.

  [Text] Santiago de Chile, 8 Jan (EFE) -- Chilean 
intellectuals and politicians participating in the International 
Conference on Humanism and Democracy for the 21st Century 
[Conferencia Internacional Sobre Humanismo y Democracia Para el 
Siglo XXI] issued a document today in which they state that the 
knot of the relationship between ethics and politics lies in the 
promotion and defense of human rights. 
  European deputies; legislators from various countries; 
Guillermo Bedregal, the Bolivian Chamber of Deputies president; 
George Melikjanz [name as received], editor in chief of the 
Russian newspaper IZVESTIA; former Tunisian Minister Faiza Kefi 
[name as received]; and other renown intellectuals and 
politicians from Europe, America, and Africa are participating 
in this conference. 
  A group of Chilean center and left-wing politicians 
presented 
a document for discussion by the conference that will end on 9 
January. It was sponsored by International Christian Democratic 
Union and the European Union. 
  The document includes issues such as ethics, politics, and 
new humanisms; international economy and solidarity; and peace, 
security, and disarmament. 
  The document points out that technological change and 
capital 
operations represent basic aspects of today's life. In the case 
of Chilean, this may be translated into the fact that 25 percent 
of national assets are in the hands of foreign entrepreneurs. 
This begs the question: How much sovereignty is a state forced 
to give up if it seeks to attract massive volumes of foreign 
capital? 
  The document also indicates that there still is "an 
overwhelming contrast between the standard of living in rich 
countries and in poor countries -- even though the wealth of the 
former, to a large extent, has been generated by the work of the 
latter." 
  The document adds: "There are regions of our planet which 
seem to have been deprived of all possible benefits that result 
from the progress derived from an international free trade 
system." This is the case, for example, in sub-Saharan Africa 
where conditions still exist that prick the consciences of the 
rest of the world." [no opening quotation marks as published] 
  The document concludes: "The ethical imperative of our times 
is to create a humanist civilization that will respect mankind 
and harmoniously integrate him and his fellow men and into the 
natural, religious, economic, and cultural environs" to prevent 
him from becoming a "slave of economic, political, and cultural 
systems that do not respect" the "values and rights" of humanity. 
  Chilean intellectuals like Roberto Garreton, Carlos Hunneus, 
and Claudio Troncoso are among the signatories to the document.

  [Excerpts] Relatives and friends of the four Chileans who 
have been convicted in Peru of having allegedly belonged to the 
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement have asked the Chilean 
Foreign Ministry to plead their case so that they might have a 
fair trial and the right to a defense. The names of the Chilean 
citizens are Jaime Castillo Petruzzi, Maria Concepcion Pincheira 
Saez, and Lautaro Mellado Saavedra -- who have been sentenced to 
life imprisonment -- and Alejandro Astorga Valdez, who was 
reportedly the only one tried by an ordinary court. According 
to the relatives of the four Chileans, they were arrested at 
several different places in Lima, Peru, last 14 October. The 
last time their mothers saw them, on 3 December, they were being 
kept in a tiny dark cell and were undernourished. Maria 
Angelica Mellado reports that irregularities were committed in 
their trial. She said: 
  [Begin recording] Despite steps taken by Chilean and foreign 
authorities, in order that they be tried by a civilian court and 
the count on high treason be wavered, as they are Chilean 
citizens, on 7 January three of them were sentenced by a 
faceless military court to life imprisonment, and to pay 
indemnification of $50 million to the Peruvian state. This goes 
against international law. [end recording] 
  She also reported that the attorneys only had access to the 
dossiers six hours before judgment was passed. [passage omitted] 
  Alfonso Rivero, Chilean ambassador to Peru, officially 
conveyed to the Peruvian Government the Chilean Government's 
concern about the situation confronting the three Chileans, who 
have been sentenced to life imprisonment in Peru. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hernando Prada Gonzalez, Colombian </F>
consul in Guasdualito, Apure State, Venezuela, with unidentified 
reporters in Santa Fe de Bogota from the "Caracol's 0600 to 
0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] The Venezuelan Government is 
investigating the crash of one of its military helicopters on 
the Colombian side of the border between the two countries. 
According to General Manuel Andara, Venezuelan acting defense 
minister, a commission is visiting the border area to establish 
if the crash was caused by mechanical failure or was attacked by 
Colombian guerrillas. National Guard members and some peasants, 
who had been captured -- according to complaints on the 
Colombian side -- in Colombian territory, were aboard that 
helicopter. It was reported in Venezuela that these people were 
arrested in Venezuela. We are now in contact with Hernando Prada 
Gonzalez, Colombian consul in the town of Guasdualito, located 
opposite the Arauca Intendance. 
  Good morning, please tell us what reports Colombian 
diplomatic representatives have received from the Venezuelan 
Government on the helicopter incident? 
  [Prada] Good morning, on Saturday at 1800 they released Mr. 
Patino, who was the only person to be held in this border area 
because of the helicopter accident you mentioned. 
  [Reporter] Did Mr. Patino say he was captured on Colombian 
soil? 
  [Prada] Yes, he said this happened on the Puerto Rico path 
in 
Colombia. You have already told the country about this. He was 
later taken aboard another helicopter to a military base 
stationed in Guasdualito. Foreign Ministry officials were 
following the case. On Saturday at 1800, he was turned over to 
the Arauca military operation command. 
  [Reporter] In addition to Mr. Patino's report, has your 
consulate received any other explanation or additional reports 
from the Venezuelan authorities. 
  [Prada] No, the only thing we received was Mr. Patino's 
return. We were told he was held as a witness to the helicopter 
crash. 
  [Reporter] We have reports that another Colombian fisherman, 
besides Mr. Patino, was captured and that the Venezuelans are 
not reporting on his whereabouts. 
  [Prada] The consulate has no knowledge of that. We talked 
with Mr. Patino, and he was the only person flown aboard a 
helicopter from the crash site to this military garrison. 
  [Reporter] Colombian authorities are guarding the Venezuelan 
helicopter. Has Venezuela requested the helicopter's return 
through you or any other channel? 
  [Prada] Not at all. The helicopter is in the custody of the 
Colombian authorities in Colombian territory. No request on the 
matter has been submitted through this consulate. 
  [Reporter] Do you think this incident has harmed relations 
between the two countries in the border area? 
  [Prada] I do not think so. We are promoting 
Colombian-Venezuelan integration. The Colombian foreign minister 
will refer to the incident this week. As far as our relations 
are concerned, they will remain normal as they have until now. 
  [Reporter] Is the climate around your office the same? Have 
you perceived any deterioration in the climate in Guasdualito? 
  [Prada] None at all.

  [Text] Defense Minister Jose Gallardo appeared before the 
Congressional Oversight Committee upon a request from Deputy 
Ricardo Novoa to report on the death of policemen and soldiers 
along the Putumayo River on 16 December 1993 and to explain why 
policemen, who are tasked with domestic security operations, 
were patrolling that area. The minister said they were on a 
joint Army-Police control operation. 
  [Begin Gallardo recording] They go upstream and downstream 
patrolling the Putumayo and San Miguel Rivers. They conduct 
control operations along the river banks and on vessels 
navigating the river in an attempt to control and detect drug 
trafficking activities. [end recording]. 
  The minister confirmed that such activities have been going 
on for years, and that is why the joint patrols were deployed. 
The objective is to prevent drug trafficking and guerrilla 
activities in the northern part of the country, particularly 
along the Colombian border. The defense minister reaffirmed 
that the Colombians being held by authorities are the guerrillas 
who killed the Ecuadoran policemen and soldiers. The guerrillas 
were found in possession of weapons and jewelry that had 
belonged to the policemen. 
  [Begin Gallardo recording] One guerrilla said: My 
grandfather gave it to me. We went to the grandfather's house 
and asked him if he had given the guerrilla the watch ten years 
ago. He said no. Then the guerrilla said he bought it at 
another place. We went there and he had not bought the watch 
there, either. The watch belonged to one of the slain men. You 
must understand that guerrillas do not parade around with 
weapons and signs saying: I am a guerrilla. They hide their 
weapons immediately. They wear the clothes of common peasants. 
Their appearance is completely misleading. [end recording] 
  The minister said they look like innocent peasants, but they 
are really guerrillas who operate in the northern part of the 
country and who are guilty of killing Ecuadoran policemen and 
soldiers.

  [Text] Quito -- Ecuador continues to withhold payments to 
commercial creditor banks, thereby increasing its overall 
foreign debt each month. As of September 1993 Ecuador's foreign 
debt was $12.6 billion. According to the latest report from the 
Central Bank, the Ecuadoran foreign debt increased 0.4 percent 
in September. In the first nine months of 1993 it increased 
approximately 4 percent. According to the same source, in 
September the foreign debt, including unpaid interest, reached 
$12.6 billion, compared to $12.55 billion in August and $12.122 
billion in December 1992.

  [Text] "Army News," an official publication of the 
Paraguayan Army, says that engineer Juan Carlos Wasmosy, the 
president of the Republic and commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces, is following orders from Armed Forces generals over the 
appointment of Cavalry officers. 
  The December issue of "Army News" carries a report 
elaborating on the latest changes in the military field. Beside 
mentioning [Army Commander] General Lino Oviedo in most 
articles, the publication reports that Wasmosy received 
instructions over some appointments in the Cavalry divisions. 
  The publication notes that the president and commander in 
chief of the Paraguayan Armed Forces appointed the new 3d 
Cavalry Division chief of staff, "on the orders" of the Army, 
which is headed by Gen. Lino Cesar Oviedo, the Army commander. 
  The text is as follows: "Engineer Juan Carlos Wasmosy, in 
his 
capacity as commander in chief of the Paraguayan Armed Forces, 
appointed DEM [General Staff School graduate] Colonel Enrique 
Montiel G. as chief of staff of the 3d Cavalry Division on the 
orders of General Rodrigo Diaz Delmas, the 1st Army Corps 
Commander, through orders issued by Gen. Lino Oviedo, the 
Paraguayan Army commander ..." A facsimile of this report, 
which appears on page 7 of the December issue of "Army News," is 
published on this page. 
  In the aforementioned publication's center page, Gen. Oviedo 
is quoted as saying he will build "one school per year to save 
Paraguay from poverty." The publication did not specify, 
however, with what funds he will build schools. There is a 
picture of the general awarding medals to high school graduates 
in the interior of the country.

  [Text] Deputy Ismael Echague [Colorado Party -- Concepcion] 
this morning denounced that "at approximately 2000 local time, 
on the eve of Blas N. Riquelme's resignation from office as 
Colorado Party president, we received a message from Government 
House to the effect that the [Colorado Party] Executive Board 
would be taken over and [Second Vice President Juan Manuel] Cano 
Melgarejo would be named party chairman unless Riquelme tendered 
his resignation." 
  Ecahgue, a member of Riquelme's faction within the party, 
further stated that one of the conditions for Riquelme's 
resignation -- imposed by Riquelme himself -- was that he would 
be replaced by Eugenio Sanabria Cantero, the party's first vice 
president. 
  Echague concluded by saying that "the pressure exerted from 
Government House was the main factor determining the former 
president's resignation, especially if one bears in mind that 
ministers and high-ranking government officials were already in 
favor of this proposal at that time."

  [Text] Lima, 10 Jan (EFE) -- The human rights situation in 
Peru will be one of the main topics Alexander Watson, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, will 
discuss during his visit to Lima next week. Meanwhile, friction 
between the two countries continues over this issue. 
  Opposition lawmaker Manuel Moreyra said today "serious 
difficulties exist" between Peru and the United States over the 
human rights issue. These difficulties, according to Moreyra, 
are reflected in the the United States' freezing of $105 million 
which it should have given Peru as a member of the second 
Support Group on the condition that Lima had to show an 
improvement in human rights in its territory. 
  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori stated on Sunday he 
hopes 
the "United States will keep the pledge made when the Support 
Group was created, because that $105 million has not been 
disbursed yet." 
  In this respect, Fujimori added, "I hope to meet all of the 
goals established by international organizations." The Peruvian 
president confirmed Watson will visit Lima 18-21 January "surely 
to engage in a direct review." He added that Watson must not 
only review the human rights situation but also that of civil 
and social rights, as well as Peru's right to achieve peace in 
the face of the political violence that has raged for more than 
13 years. 
  Political observers indicated today that besides the topic 
of 
human rights, Watson, who served as ambassador in Peru from 1986 
to 1989, will discuss matters dealing with possible ways to 
improve the war on drug trafficking, progress in the nation's 
democratic institutional life following the "self-inflicted" 
coup of 5 April 1992, and advances to make the judicial branch 
more independent. 
  On this last point, Justice Minister Fernando Vega Santa 
Gadea today said, "we are trying to enforce respect for human 
rights as much as possible" in Peru. Talking to local radio 
station Radio Programas del Peru, Vega Santa Gadea admitted he 
had refused to meet with the Goldman Commission from the United 
States, which investigated the human rights situation in Peru 
and its judicial system. 
  The commission, which arrived in Peru in early December, was 
chaired by lawyer Roberto Goldman of Washington's American 
University, asked to meet with the minister through Charles 
Brayshaw, the U.S. charge d'affaires in Lima. 
  Vega Santa Gadea stated today that Brayshaw's letter "was 
unacceptable to a sovereign country, and he added "I do not let 
anyone come to tell me how I must run our justice system" -- 
something that constitutes meddling in the internal affairs of 
the country. 
  In August 1993, the Goldman Commission visited Peru and 
drafted a 150-page report, which the business newspaper GESTION 
described today, citing government sources, as "totally and 
absolutely biased" and full of preconceptions. 
  Meanwhile, the Peruvian congressional Human Rights Committee 
has drafted a report on 12 cases of human rights violations 
cited by the U.S. State Department, which range from mass 
murders in the country's jails in 1986, during the government of 
Alan Garcia (1985-90), to the murders of residents in the town 
of Cayara (Ayacucho Department) in 1988. It also includes the 
death of 16 peasants in Iquicha (Ayacucho) in 1990, the murders 
of journalist Hugo Bustios (1988) and Fernando Mejia, a lawyer 
of peasant communities, and others.

  [Text] Lima, 10 Jan (EFE) -- According to a report 
published today in the Lima magazine SI, the terrorist violence 
that persists in Peru is led by Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias 
"Feliciano," who has rejected the leadership of Abimael Guzman, 
the founder of the Maoist Shining Path who is in favor of a 
peace agreement. 
  The rejection by Ramirez Durand of the orders of Guzman, who 
is the top leader and is considered the "guiding thought" of the 
terrorist organization, has led this group to a schism which is 
analyzed by the political weekly publication. The report states 
that while Guzman seeks to put an end to the "people's war" with 
his petitions for a peace agreement with Peruvian President 
Alberto Fujimori, "Feliciano" and his followers advocate a 
continuation of violence. 
  Ramirez, who is considered the number three man of the group 
after Guzman and his mistress Elena Iparraguirre -- who are both 
sentenced to life imprisonment -- has become the leader of those 
who follow him and who now disavow the leadership of the Shining 
Path founder. According to the magazine, the dissidents today 
recognize "Feliciano" as the new "president" of the Shining 
Path. For them, Guzman no longer is "President Gonzalo," and he 
has become "just another prisoner." 
  The attacks that took place in Lima during the last week of 
December and the first week of January -- including the 
detonation of car bombs in the Prefecture (Civil Government) of 
Lima that left over 20 injured and considerable damage -- are 
attributed to this radical group. 
  The weekly publication feels that this "recalcitrant" group 
of Shining Path was formed by the union of the People's Aid of 
Peru -- a Shining Path group that supported armed actions and 
provided all types of assistance to the activists -- with the 
Metropolitan Committee that has formed a Regional Directorate. 
According to the report, this directorate would come under a 
central committee that has been reorganized under the leadership 
of Ramirez Durand. 
  The report adds that in Lima, four special detachments have 
been organized by the veterans in the terrorist struggle, and 
that only one of them -- the one in the eastern area of the city 
-- is reportedly engaging in military actions, while the others 
are conducting political activities to recruit new militants. 
  In October of 1993, three weeks after Abimael Guzman sent 
the 
first letter from prison to the Peruvian president asking him to 
hold talks for a peace agreement, in more than one town of Puno 
Department, southeast of Lima, there appeared signs that read: 
"Viva President Feliciano." 
  The weekly adds that, later, in the jungle region of Tingo 
Maria, a Shining Path column stopped a passenger vehicle and one 
of the members told them that "Feliciano" had assumed leadership 
of the organization because "Guzman is no longer President 
Gonzalo, because he is a traitor to the revolutionary cause." 
"We do not agree with the letter of surrender. To the 
contrary, we will continue to struggle," the Shining Path member 
reportedly said. 
  SI states that the reports show "two lines, two directions, 
two currents," and that the other one is that made up of 2,500 
Shining Path members, who are being held in 10 prisons in the 
country. Abimael Guzman exercises control over them. It adds 
that Guzman has managed to retain the loyalty of that group, due 
to a project begun three months ago when the two letters in 
which he asked Fujimori for peace were made public. 
  The magazine states that the Shining Path leader obtained 
the 
transfer from Yanamayo Prison (in Puno) to Lima of several 
leaders, including Osman Morote, Martha Huatay, Victor Zavala, 
and Maria Pantoja. Guzman instructed the imprisoned militants 
at a meeting in the Naval Base where he is being held to 
persuade the imprisoned members to accept the request for peace. 
  Shining Path members who are being held in the prisons of 
Santa Monica and Canto Grande of Lima and Yanamayo Prison in 
Puno have expressed support for Abimael Guzman's peace request.

  [Text] Lima, 7 Jan (EFE) -- Drug trafficking is spreading 
throughout Peru. Today there was a report on the discovery of 
pits for soaking coca leaves and making basic cocaine paste in 
areas of the country previously untouched by drug trafficking. 
  According to newspaper reports, four soaking pits were 
discovered in a house in Puerto Maldonado, the capital of the 
jungle department of Madre de Dios, which borders Brazil and 
Bolivia. 
  The discovery, which was made by the General Narcotics 
Directorate, has confirmed reports that drug traffickers -- who 
may have expanded their operations from Ayacucho to Cuzco in the 
Andean region -- are moving to Madre de Dios. 
  Authorities arrested the owner of the house and seized 
precursor chemicals such as ammonia and kerosene used to make 
basic paste. 
  Peru is the world's largest producer of the coca leaf, the 
raw material for cocaine, followed by Bolivia. 
  The newspaper EXPRESO also revealed today that an Army 
colonel and commander are currently on trial for keeping 114 kg 
of basic cocaine paste seized in a 1992 counternarcotics 
operation in the Huallaga River Valley in the northern jungle 
department of San Martin, an area known for drug trafficking. 
  The newspaper identified the officers as Colonel Eduardo 
Alvarado and Commander Walter Bue, who were accused by General 
Eduardo Bellido, who was chief of the Huallaga Front's 
political-military command at the time of the operation. 
  There are two other drug-trafficking cases in this same area 
that presumably involve an Army noncommissioned officer and a 
National Police officer. 
  It was also reported today that the Peruvian Navy discharged 
two officers and a technician who were arrested by the New 
Orleans Police (United States) for carrying pure cocaine. 
  Lima's EL COMERCIO newspaper revealed today that three 
sailors were arrested on 19 November 1993 in New Orleans after 
disembarking from the Navy vessel Ilo. The Navy members were 
identified as Jorge Saldias, Raul Baylon, and William Tello. 
  Based on a confidential report by the National Police 
Narcotics Intelligence Department, EL COMERCIO revealed on 3 
January that the production of washed basic cocaine paste in the 
country for 1993 reached 600 tons. 
  According to the report, not even 1 percent of that amount 
produced in Peruvian cocaine-producing areas -- specifically, 
the Peruvian central jungle and the Huallaga River Valley -- was 
seized during 1993. 
  The drug traffickers used over 2 million tons of basic paste 
to produce 600 tons of basic cocaine paste, which is 
subsequently washed to be "exported" by light Colombian planes 
flying to Peru. 
  The new development is that cocaine farmers not only grow 
the 
plant but also make the raw basic paste from the leaves they 
soak. They then take the paste to storage centers designated by 
Peruvian drug traffickers to be shipped to Colombia by light 
planes or crafts. 
  In addition to the Huallaga River Valley, the basic paste is 
produced in the Mayo River Valley, San Martin Department and 
Alto Maranon River, Amazonas Department -- both of which are 
located in the country's northern jungle, and in the areas 
between the Ene and Apurimac Rivers in the central jungle. 
  Other major cocaine areas include those of Puerto Inca and 
Puerto Bermudez in the jungle of Pasco Department in the 
Peruvian central mountain range.

<F P=106> [Article by Alfredo Carquez Saavedra] </F>
  [Text] The growing need to spend a large part of family 
budgets on the absolutely essential needs for subsistence, 
particularly foodstuffs, has become one of the most serious 
obstacles preventing the citizens of Venezuela from gaining 
access to their own housing. 
  According to a study coordinated and financed by the Latin 
American Social Research Institute (ILDIS) and the State Reform 
Commission (COPRE), carried out by sociologist Enma de 
Ghinaglia, and included in the social agenda for the nineties, 
"the distribution of family expenditures may be an important 
indicator for gaining an understanding of what portion of income 
is committed to meeting subsistence needs, and what proportion 
could be allocated to other need categories, including housing." 
  According to this work, this indicator would be variable and 
would be manifested differently in the various strata of the 
population, depending on the development of inflation and the 
mobility in the earning of income. 
  Enma de Ghinaglia notes that according to the family budget 
survey carried out by the Central Bank of Venezuela, poor 
households spent 50 percent of their income on food in 1989, 
while the figures for the middle and upper strata were 42 and 31 
percent, respectively. 
  This situation would seem to have deteriorated in the 
1990's, 
because the document in question says that "the portion of their 
expenditures the poorest households allocated for food came to 
68 percent of the family budgets in 1992." 
  On this point, it is also noted that at the present time the 
lowest strata (D and E) no longer have available the 15 percent 
they formerly devoted to basic housing maintenance. 
<H5>  The Unattainable Ceiling </H5>
  The work by Ghinaglia says that according to the data 
provided by the 1990 Population and Census Housing, a gross 
housing deficit of 880,083 units still existed. This figure 
included 459,157 units deemed unacceptable, based on their 
"physical-structural" condition, and 420,926 housing units being 
shared by several families (functional deficit). 
  Based on certain indicators such as the purchasing power of 
Venezuelan families, the study stratified current housing needs 
in terms of possible availability and family expectations. 
  --Stratum I. The insolvent category, made up of families 
with 
incomes below the minimum monthly wage (9,000 bolivares). This 
category includes 21 percent of the households that are below 
the extreme poverty line (743,358 households). Satisfaction of 
the housing needs of families in this category is postponed 
because of the primary requirement of meeting survival needs. 
  --Stratum II. This category is made up of barely solvent 
families with monthly incomes ranging between one and three 
times the minimum wage (between 9,000 and 27,000 bolivares). 
This category includes 49 percent of the households in the 
country (1,741,774) hovering on the poverty line. For this group 
as well, the need to provide other basic necessities overrides 
the need to resolve this problem. 
  --Stratum III. This category is made up of families with 
average solvency and earning monthly incomes ranging between 
three and five times the basic wage (between 27,000 and 45,000 
bolivares). This category includes 23 percent of the households 
(835,011). These families have a limited portion of their own 
resources available. Here, housing is an urgent need. 
  --Stratum IV. This category is made up of solvent families 
with incomes ranging between five and 10 times the minimum 
monthly wage (between 45,000 and 90,000 bolivares). It includes 
6 percent of the households (200,553). Relatively speaking, 
these families' needs are satisfied. Housing plays an important 
role in family life. 
  --Stratum V. This category is made up of highly solvent 
families with incomes exceeding 10 times the minimum monthly 
wage. Only 1 percent of the households (40,270) are included in 
this category. These families are able to satisfy a broad range 
of needs. Housing is even perceived as a status symbol and as an 
investment. 
  One of the phenomena brought out by this study is the 
imbalance in housing demand, since "it can be seen that the 
solvent strata absorb the supply intended for the weaker or less 
solvent strata." 
  Among the factors believed to affect this phenomenon are the 
following: 

  -  The impossibly high prices, in terms of purchasing 
capacity. 
  -  The disparity between types of housing and family 
expectations. 
  -  The lack of resources to meet the needs of Strata 
I and III, according to the provisions of the Housing Policy 
Law. 
  -  The high inflation rates. 
  -  Various legal restrictions. 

    With the implementation of the Housing Policy Law, this 
sociologist says, 98.587 billion bolivares have been allocated 
to this sector in the past three years. Of this sum, 70 percent 
was designated for Assistance Area I in the law. It is expected 
that a total of 38.822 billion bolivares will be allocated for 
the financing of the law in 1993. 
  Between 1990 and 1992, the total number of units produced 
was 
186,111. This result, the researcher comments, would seem 
limited to the production of housing units in the formal sector, 
"if the volume of the resources allocated to Areas I and III is 
compared with the results achieved in the effective period for 
the Housing Policy Law and the magnitude of the needs of the 
families."

  [Text] At the Eighth Meeting of the Board of Directors of 
the Andean Development Corporation (CAF), two loans to the 
Venezuelan energy sector totaling $62 million were approved. 
  Enrique Garcia, the president of this regional financial 
body, explained that one of the loans, in the amount of $50 
million, will be used for the construction of the Caruachi 
Hydroelectric Plant. It will have an installed capacity of 2,160 
megawatts and will produce an average energy volume of 13,300 
gigawatt/hours annually for incorporation in the interconnected 
national system. 
  The second loan, in the amount of $12 million, will be used 
for the cofinancing of the construction and commissioning of 
another plant, Macagua II, a project begun in 1987, Garcia said. 
  "The corporation allocated $33 million for this plant in 
1992. It is planned as a continuation of Macagua I, and includes 
projects for the control of the Caroni River, for creating a 
reservoir, and for increasing the generating capacity by 
regulating the flow reaching the final stretch of the Guri. With 
a nominal capacity of 2,548 megawatts, it is expected that the 
first generating units at this plant will be commissioned next 
year, and the last ones in 1997." These projects fall within the 
areas designated as priorities by the CAF, Garcia said, since 
they will contribute to meeting the increasing demand of the 
nation and the Venezuelan industrial export sector for 
electrical energy. Currently, the EDELCA [Caroni River 
Electrification Project] owns and operates two hydroelectric 
plants on the Caroni. They are Macagua I and the Raul Leoni 
Power Plant (Guri), the second largest in the world. 
  These power plants have made it possible to develop heavy 
industry in the Guayana region of Venezuela, in addition to 
meeting more than 70 percent of the domestic demand for 
electrical energy. 
  The recent meeting of the CAF Board of Directors also 
approved the grant of a loan of $70 million to the Republic of 
Venezuela to cofinance a program designed to manage and preserve 
the primary highway network. The execution of the program will 
be the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport and 
Communications (MTC). 
  Enrique Garcia explained that this project (Highway III) is 
of vital importance to the country because the 36,000 kilometers 
in the principal highway network in Venezuela have deteriorated, 
in terms of both the surfaces (pavement layers, drainage 
facilities, bridges, and tunnels) and the signaling and safety 
aspects. 
  "This project, the total cost of which will come to $852 
million, involves a multiple-investment plan to be implemented 
between 1994 and 1998, with three principal 
components--institutional strengthening, maintenance, and 
investments--as its basis." 
  Garcia noted that the financing will be provided by the 
Inter-American Development Bank ($200 million), the World Bank 
($150 million), the MTC ($432 million), and the CAF. On this 
basis, the plans call for the rehabilitation of more than 2,000 
kilometers of roads, 730 bridges, and some 150 kilometers of 
tunnels; for major maintenance work on some 3,200 kilometers of 
roadway; and for the purchase of equipment to be used in the 
supervision of the work and the signaling system. 
  The program will be implemented by the MTC through the 
General Sectorial Highway System Office, the president of the 
corporation stated. However, some projects may be handled by the 
state administrations, since it is they who bear the 
responsibility for road maintenance. A decentralization 
agreement is being signed by the central government and the 
states. 
  Another loan of $20 million approved by the CAF will go to a 
private business, Manufacturas de Papel, C.A. [Paper 
Manufacturing, Inc.] (MANPA) for the design and production of a 
machine (Machine Project 8) to produce various types of toilet 
paper. 
  "This project is being executed on the premises of the 
Maracay Paper Factory, located in the State of Aragua. This is a 
business belonging to the Delfino Group, which has been a leader 
in paper manufacturing since 1912. It has the capacity to 
produce 50,000 tons of tissue paper annually, which satisfies 
about 40 percent of the domestic market demand. The surplus 
production is exported." 
  Garcia emphasized that with the launching of this project, 
the hope is to increase production by about 27,000 metric tons 
per year, enabling MANPA to satisfy the increase in demand on 
both the national and the international levels, particularly in 
the Latin American and Caribbean areas.

  [Text] Today was the last day of Army General Raul Castro's 
tour of the Western Army. The inspection, which began in 
December, began today with a visit to the San Antonio de los 
Banos Air Base. Politburo member Jose Ramon Machado Ventura; 
Division General Leopoldo Cintras Frias, chief of the Western 
Army; and Candido Palmero, first secretary of the Communist 
Party of Cuba [PCC] in Havana, as well as other secretaries, 
ministers, and PCC officials, accompanied Castro. 
  The briefing on the combat readiness of the base was 
presented by Colonel Marrero Hernandez, chief of this historical 
air base which opened fire against the mercenary planes on the 
eve of the Bay of Pigs invasion and from which our scarce planes 
and intrepid pilots departed to confront the enemy in the Bay of 
Pigs. This base's revolutionary fire also frightened the U.S. 
from its overflights during the October Crisis. Despite special 
period difficulties, this large air and anti-air unit maintains 
its combat readiness and the spirit of struggle from those 
glorious days. It is also known for its pilots' participation in 
internationalist missions in Ethiopia and Angola. 
  Castro showed interest in learning of the personnel's living 
conditions, food, housing, and other aspects of life on the 
base. He was told of a recent presentation of homes, and the 
progress made in several dozen more, which are to be completed 
this year. The food situation is improving to the extent that 
the unit's farming program develops, thanks to the unit's 
self-sufficiency efforts. They presently have over 700 hectares 
of arable land within the base's perimeter. Castro stated: "Let 
there not be a single corner left unplanted." 
  Raul and his companions expressed interest in the 
characteristics of several planes. Lieutenant Col. Perez Perez, 
who had been a Camilito student, and later an 
internationalist-mission ace pilot, explained the capabilities 
of the antisubmarine helicopter [Mi-14] and Mig-29 [Fulcrum] 
fighters. An intense emulation program exists among the diverse 
Western Army maintenance units and those that contribute to the 
construction of extensive fortification projects such as the 
Sugar Industry Ministry, the Agriculture Ministry, and the Blas 
Roca Contingent. 
  Raul presented emulation awards to a brigade of the Blas 
Roca 
that is working on project No. 70, and to the company working on 
project No. 26 in the depths of the earth of the fatherland. 
Both units surpassed their 1993 plans, as well as the required 
quality parameters. Raul extended warm words of experience to 
the dedicated soldiers and civilian workers, and toured the 
underground facility that will be completed this year. 
  At the well-known Sonrisa de la Victoria Camp of Farm No. 2 
of the Guira de Melena Miscellaneous Crops Enterprise, Raul and 
his companions conducted a thorough analysis of the work of the 
Youth Labor Army [EJT], which took over the management of this 
enterprise two months ago. The positive changes effected during 
this brief period were emphasized. The EJT has implemented a new 
annual plan structured according to week, type of farm, and 
crop; production and consumption norms, and a workday never 
shorter than eight hours. The plan will be adjusted to changing 
conditions resulting from increases in productivity, weather, 
shortages, and other factors. This farm has approximately 39 
caballerias of fertile soil, and is 95-percent irrigated. The 
annual plan foresees producing 11,500 tons of tubers, grains, 
plantains, and garden vegetables. The work force consists of 221 
EJT soldiers and 62 farmers. Over 91 percent of the workers are 
directly involved with the land. Seventy percent of the fuel 
will be used for irrigation, only 20 percent for agrarian 
machinery, since 31 ox teams will reduce the need for tractors. 
The remaining 10 percent will be used mainly for transportation, 
plus a minimal amount for administration work. 
  According to Division General Rigoberto Garcia Fernandez, 
chief of the EJT, this situation is repeated in another 19 farms 
under EJT management, which is 40 percent of the state lands 
used for miscellaneous crops in Havana. The EJT has about 5,000 
soldiers and regular workers in the province. The plan for 1994 
is to surpass 4.5 million quintals. 
  Another aspect analyzed in the meeting was the fight against 
crime and the operation of the Unified Vigilance and Protection 
System, based on the experiences of Guira de Melena 
municipality, and on the premises of the report presented by PCC 
provincial leader Pedro Zaez. 
  The presence and contributions of Division General Carlos 
Fernandez Condin, Interior Ministry first vice minister; Justice 
Minister Carlos Amat; Supreme Court President Jose Raul Amaro; 
and Attorney General Juan Escalona enriched the discussion of 
this important issue which is more critical in a large food 
production area so close to the capital. A resolute effort 
against crime was noticed. It was stressed that the 
understanding of the mode of operation of cattle rustlers and 
agrarian product thieves should result in more specific measures 
within the framework of Cuban law. 
  Raul spoke briefly to the farmworkers, told them of the 
ideas 
discussed at the meeting, and expressed his hope for them to 
achieve new and better work results, productivity, resource 
conservation, cost reductions, and high agrarian yields to 
benefit our people's food needs. 
  Raul also briefly visited the Western Army intelligence unit 
where he was briefed on how this unit satisfactorily fulfills 
its mission. Raul showed great interest in the diverse 
facilities of the unit, and its outstanding and sophisticated 
equipment for the mission of discovering the enemies' plans for 
aggression against Cuba. Raul also observed a dexterous 
demonstration of martial exercises by the troops. 
  The final stop in the tour was a visit to an antiair 
regiment 
where a brief demonstration of the operation of a modern SAM 
[surface to air missile] unit was observed. Central Committee 
members Eusebio Leal and Felipe Perez were invited to attend 
this final leg of the itinerary. The minister's final words, 
closing the extensive tour, were brief and eloquent: "The 
Western Army is in outstanding shape and is successfully 
fulfilling the five strategic goals of the Ministry of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces. The western part of Cuba, as well as 
the entire island is an undefeatable bulwark."

  [Text] We are witnessing the final hours of formalism in 
the practice of the Cuban labor union movement. We no longer 
patiently accept the repetitive rhetoric uttered by those who 
are constantly emitting general slogans but who barely broach 
the specific and objective reality on which they should act. 
This is the opening sentence of the editorial printed in today's 
TRABAJADORES newspaper entitled: "Who Are the Drafters of Our 
Policies?" 
  The editorial continues: We are not talking about the labor 
unions getting away from politics and ideological work. It is 
time that we realize the labor union movement's singular 
political responsibility for education in the battle for 
survival, as well as for later, when we enter a world that will 
be different in many ways. 
  The editorial points out the need for labor unions to be 
part 
of all of today's and tomorrow's political battles. The 
editorial underscores: It is necessary to be on the offensive at 
all times. The time when the tradition was to wait for the 
decisions from the top for every movement and every action is 
over. The article reaffirms: That is why we proudly salute all 
the labor union leaders who have been struggling decisively to 
maintain a high level of morale, discipline, and order in their 
work centers. 
  The editorial goes on to say that nothing can be more 
demoralizing than idleness, indolence, negligence, shoddiness, 
the lack of control over production costs and other expenses, 
embezzlement of resources, and the waste that characterizes the 
atmosphere of some work centers. The editorial stresses: The 
objectives and general principles by which the workers and their 
labor union representatives should guide themselves have already 
been established. These principles stem from an analysis of the 
situation the country faces and the predictable path we will 
have to travel to change it. 
  It is necessary that the labor union leaders assume their 
role of revolutionary activists, their role as leaders capable 
of explaining to and informing workers of the general situation 
of the country and what the workers can do at their work centers 
to fight back and improve the situation. The article also refers 
to the need to profoundly debate the topics related to financial 
organization, because what is being attempted has to be 
congruent with the idea that workers are the owners; therefore, 
the solutions should be based on the consensus of the work force.

<F P=106> [Report by Wilfred Alayon from Matanzas for the "Evening </F>
Information Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Petroleum production in the country during 1993 
amounted to 1.1 million tons, 70 percent of which came from the 
oil fields in Matanzas Province. 
  The total amount produced in Matanzas was 814,000 tons, 
which 
is equal to 7.15 million barrels. All these amounts are 
records, both for Matanzas and on a nationwide level, despite 
the fact that it is still not enough to meet the country's 
requirements. That is because approximately 90 percent of the 
electricity in Cuba is produced by thermoelectric generators, 
which have been adapted to use domestic heavy crude oil, and 
this represents slightly more than 30 percent of the fuel 
consumed. 
  It is therefore important to understand the enormous 
responsibility of the Central Petroleum Extraction and Drilling 
Enterprise, which is in Cardenas Municipality in Matanzas 
Province, 150 km east of the Cuban capital. That enterprise 
makes the largest contribution to the country's oil production. 
  The enterprise of the Yumuri area is made up of 
approximately 
2,000 men, including specialists, workers, and administrative 
personnel, all highly qualified and experienced people. 
  This year the development of the gas-oil program will be 
subject to the conditions of the current financial situation, 
which is why a slight increase in the extraction of the 
so-called black gold is foreseen. 
  However, in light of the financial problems, the country's 
directorate decided to take measures to provide more facilities 
for the producers of Matanzas Province. This, together with the 
solution of the technical problems that kept the foreign 
associates from attaining the production goals estimated for the 
oil wells directly operated by them, will allow us to maintain a 
sustained annual increase in the extraction of hydrocarbons.

  [Text] According to estimates, in 1993 the Cuban Government 
paid 1.371 billion pesos in retirement and pension benefits and 
approximately 250 million pesos in maternity, accident, and 
sickness benefits. More than 1.271 million people received 
social security benefits in 1993, 53,000 more than in 1992. 
Every year, and despite the country's serious economic 
limitations, the social security expenses increase as do the 
number of people who benefit from this system. It is expected 
that 1.693 billion pesos will be allocated to the social 
security system in 1994. More than 1 billion pesos will be used 
to cover retirement and pension benefits.

  [Text] Cuba's cooperation with Bolivia has solved the 
serious health problems of about 5,000 [Bolivian] children. 
Furthermore, "many Bolivians are walking about with Cuban 
kidneys," Cuba's ambassador, Angel Gustavo Bruguez Perez, said 
yesterday. 
  At the end of a formal farewell visit to Bolivian President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the Cuban diplomat completed his 
mission with a report on his 10 years in La Paz. 
  He spoke of the health care programs his country's 
government 
has supported in Bolivia, including the establishment of three 
intensive care facilities for children in the cities of La Paz, 
Santa Cruz, and Sucre, where the lives of 5,000 children have 
been saved. He said that thousands of Bolivian citizens are now 
walking about with Cuban kidneys. These people went to Cuba for 
specialized medical treatment. 
  Bruguez was decorated with the "Condor of the Andes" medal 
with the Great Cross, in recognition of his work to benefit 
Bolivia during the 10 years he headed his country's diplomatic 
legation. 
  Certain that he will return to Bolivia, the diplomat said he 
will again stroll along Avenida Buenos Aires or the Rodriguez 
Market. He said he has established a home in La Paz and that his 
children are studying in Bolivia. He also spoke of Cuba's 
cooperation in sports, especially for Bolivian participation in 
the Bolivar Olympic Games. 
  Minister of Foreign Relations Antonio Aranibar said: 
"Despite 
the enormous difficulties facing the Cuban people, their 
government has provided significant cooperation in the fields of 
education, health, and sports."

<F P=106> [Article by Iliana Hautrive] </F>
  [Text] Slightly less than three months after the 
reintroduction of self-employment in Cuba, results can already 
be seen in attaining its primary objectives: satisfying the 
population's needs, providing jobs, and generating state 
revenues. 
  A recent evaluation by the National Assembly deputies on the 
economic affairs committee showed that with the passage of time 
after the implementation of Decree-Law 141, the self-employment 
phenomena are growing increasingly complex, which means that 
activity is expanding, not the contrary. 
  The greatest achievement of this measure was certainly 
eliminating needs not being met by the state, and helping to 
reactivate the national economy. Among other things, it provides 
another outlet in Cuba's present imperfect and difficult 
situation. 
  This effort requires constant modification to continue 
seeking a happy medium, whose essence consists in not drifting 
toward capitalism, but instead developing a Cuban formula in 
order to comply with the fundamental principles that have given 
it life. 
  Over 106,000 applications have so far been made, and of 
these 
almost 87,000 were approved; fewer than 2 percent were rejected. 
This shows a trend toward greater openness in this area. 
  The status of workers who were self-employed some years ago 
is also favorable, and while the number of approved occupations 
has been increasing, it seems promising that studies are 
continuing for the approval of others, and also of occupational 
sectors that may be included as suitable for self-employment. 
  With ups and downs related to the particular features of 
each 
area, the matter of supervision is now a topic of debate. In 
some places, like Holguin and Granma, inspections and procedures 
have been established, but that has not been done in all 
provinces. 
  I believe the city of Havana merits different treatment, but 
there is no doubt that the legal instrument now being prepared 
by the State Finance Committee will provide a positive mechanism 
for dealing with possible violations. 
  Moreover, more than a few people believe that 
self-employment 
foments the diversion of resources and other forms of crime, and 
the strict controls of which we are speaking must also deal with 
this vital issue. Still, I agree with those who think the 
negative phenomenon of theft was present before the 
implementation of Decree-Law 141, and now it should disappear 
with more stringent controls. 
  The issue of prices is also controversial, with a range 
going 
from a pair of earrings for 10 pesos up to a small carton of 
fried rice, pork, meat, or salad, which may cost 70 pesos, 
depending on the province, day, and category of the place of 
sale, as is frequent in the Paladar network--recalling the 
unforgettable Raquel of "Vale Todo" ["Worth It All"]--so well 
known in the city of Havana. 
  I agree that some prices are too high, but prices are 
subject 
to the laws of supply and demand, in which prices cannot be 
managed. They will regulate themselves as the situation 
stabilizes and there will be greater satisfaction of needs. 
  In one essential oversight--which may include strong fines 
and even confiscations--consideration is being given to the 
future application of a variable progressive tax on personal 
earnings. Sales and services for foreign currency, which are 
damaging the meaning of self-employment, also need to be 
scrutinized more carefully. 
  Taking a positive view, I think of the hundreds of thousands 
of workers who, because of the necessary layoffs in search of 
greater efficiency, may find an occupation and employment in 
this activity, not to mention people of diminished capacity, 
those without jobs, housewives, and retirees; all these people 
will ensure a good selection. 
  I am also thinking of the revenues that may be provided for 
next year's state budget; the program may also help to improve 
finances and reduce the excessive amounts of cash in circulation 
in Cuba. 
  In a preliminary accounting, self-employment seems to be 
working, though it has its weak points because of the short time 
it has existed. Soon improvements will be made, and there will 
be more complete control; the workers' movement may also focus 
on this new labor sector. 
  And of course, when the National Assembly of the People's 
Government examines the application of Decree-Law 141, the 
debate will be enriched and the Cuban economy will move toward 
the consolidation of another necessary measure that will be of 
great benefit in our immediate future.

  [Text] The trial move toward commercial advertising, 
initiated on an experimental basis by Cuban television during 
the broadcasting of the Central American and Caribbean Games, is 
one of many self-financing approaches the media may use. 
  Television is an institution that has been totally 
subsidized 
by the Cuban state in both its national currency and its 
convertible currency costs. It is now advisable to seek new ways 
of pursuing its educational, cultural, and informational mission. 
  For some years television, through the INTER TV 
organization, 
has been working on a self-financing system, but it is still 
quite far from meeting television's very expensive financial 
needs. 
  The income that has to date been generated from the sale of 
technical services and of some Cuban programs to foreign 
agencies is still not sufficient to cover its short-term 
requirements. 
  Starting in 1993 they began to look at other ways of 
increasing services at competitive prices to major productions 
of foreign organizations, including cinema, and they will begin 
coproductions in which television will receive dividends based 
on its participation. 
  One example of this is the production of a series set in 
Cuba 
and the Caribbean with a Spanish television company, in which 
Cuban television will provide the talent and equipment without 
payment having to be made in convertible currency. 
  Other possibilities are dubbing and subtitling. This is 
available to date in up to seven languages. The potential of 
film archives is also being explored. There is a great wealth of 
images, and this product carries a high price per minute. The 
marketing of sound archives of productions that are the property 
of Cuban radio and television has also not been ruled out. These 
activities also include the start of the production of 
advertising, intended especially for foreign organizations. 
  This is taking place at a time when there are foreign 
capital 
investments in Cuba, and mixed public-private enterprises are 
being formed with Cuban groups. The inevitable products, firms, 
and commercial brands of a number of internationally known 
companies are beginning to appear. Most of these companies have 
good budgets for promotional costs, publicity, and public 
relations. 
  One part of the media that could most benefit from this is 
radio and television. How it should be done requires intelligent 
handling. 
  Juan Hernandez, vice president of ICRT [Cuban Institute of 
Radio and Television], told me some time ago that one of the 
strong points of Cuban television is precisely that it is not 
commercial or subject to the will of advertisers who in other 
television stations decide on its fate. So including ads in ours 
may seem contradictory. However, within the array of publicity 
available, we will select ads that seek to enhance a company's 
image, emphasizing its social orientation. In that way the 
viewer receives a pleasant, nonconsumerist image that may often 
become a message promoting behavior that will benefit families 
and society. 
  This is done through sponsorship, in which an advertiser 
helps to finance a broadcast in exchange for his participation 
being mentioned. 
  Using this concept, and based on experience with sports 
broadcasting (where internationally the presence of active 
publicity has become inevitable), and given the high costs of 
satellite transmission of sports events, Cuban television 
decided to experiment with the Central American and Caribbean 
Games and seek sponsors. 
  Foreign firms and associated Cuban groups responded to this 
invitation and--apparently--everyone benefitted. This commercial 
opportunity was especially advantageous for Cuban groups, most 
of which have very limited budgets for presenting their image. 
  According to the president of Cubanacan S.A., Abraham 
Maciques, it is necessary to boost the image of merchandise that 
is not advertised and, therefore, not sold. For the corporation 
he heads, investing about $8,000 in the television promotion in 
Ponce may mean a great deal in the future, since all over the 
world major tourist attractions invest 10 percent of their 
profits in activities of this nature, while Cubanacan has only 
spent 2 percent. Canada now spends about $400,000 on promotional 
advertising to attract 110,000 tourists, and a much higher 
amount needs to be spent to induce a German to choose Cuba as 
his destination. 
  The experiment with the Central American Games in Ponce 
proved successful economically, and the impact on the population 
was examined in social surveys. 
  There were varied responses, ranging from "I was not 
surprised," or "this is normal in sports arenas," to "it makes 
the broadcast seem more dynamic," or "I do not like it, but I 
will accept it if it is best for Cuba." 
  Certain that the practice is feasible with the philosophy we 
have outlined, it would not be difficult to finance sports 
broadcasts in the coming years, as long as good management is 
exercised for the acquisition of rights and sponsors. 
  The daring move of attempting this experiment, apart from 
the 
financial return it produced for Cuban television, gave viewers 
at home access to a spectacle in which the Cuban team won the 
gold medal in games at which dignity and patriotism were on 
display.

  [Text] Nauseating odors and swarms of flies surround us in 
many parts of the capital city. Trash spills out of the few 
containers available, looking ugly and acting as a vector for 
"epidemics," as our grandparents used to call insect-borne 
diseases. This image, which leaves much to be desired, has two 
causes: inadequate trash collections, and the unfortunate 
carelessness of those of us who live in the city. We toss things 
to right and left as we complain about the city's trash 
collection services, not thinking about the difficulties caused 
by the fuel shortage and the poor condition of the equipment. 
This depressing and ugly situation--which is not seen in other 
Cuban cities and provinces--could be avoided if we paid a little 
more attention to the beauty of which we boast. I remember the 
residents of my neighborhood when I was young sweeping their 
little section of sidewalk every day. One of my childhood 
memories is hearing people tell us to "listen for the trash to 
come," meaning the open carts that at a set time of day 
collected, block by block, the cans or bins every resident took 
out at that precise instant so that unpleasant odors would not 
linger until the air carried them away, and so the flies would 
fly after the trash collection vehicle. What do we and the 
People's Councils need to do about this?

  [Text] The people's great concern about the proliferation 
of theft and black marketeering is reflected in the letters that 
suddenly piled up on my desk or the telephone calls I received 
after an article published a few weeks ago. 
  It seems as if many people had been waiting to see these 
ideas that have so much to do with our future set down in black 
and white. Apart from the need to identify these serious 
problems, everyone asked how to stop a phenomenon that is 
compromising our society's value system. 
  Who will our leaders be, and what will they be like in 2010 
or 2020? We wonder about this if our children grow up immersed 
in contradictory situations: when they are told one thing by 
their families or their school, and then they see shady deals or 
observe goods coming from the black market, as well as other 
improper behaviors. 
  Such situations also have equivalents in language, in which 
actions have an abstract representation. 
  For people now in their thirties, the expression being a 
fighter was related to high ideals. Not so now. 
  Earning a living used to be applied to examples of 
self-denial and hard work in extreme poverty: mothers who worked 
as laundresses, fathers who held multiple jobs, all of which 
they undertook to support their family. Not anymore. 
  Making good bread used to mean just what the words said, and 
was a badge of pride if applied to a creator of bakery 
delicacies. Now, though, that expression may refer to the 
productive night of a petty thief who skims off goods from a 
state store. 
  Similar semantics have produced at least a hundred 
linguistic 
innovations related to that vital area where things that belong 
to all are enjoyed by a few, and what should be distributed 
through the commercial network goes out through back doors, to 
be sold on street corners, in city alleys, and semiconcealed 
outlets. 
  These phenomena are certainly hard to root out while we are 
living in this time of shortages, but it is essential to act 
from an ideological viewpoint if we want to preserve values that 
are the mainstay of our nation's ethical heritage. 
<H5>  Hitting Bottom </H5>
  That is the title of a book my colleague Jorge Rodriguez 
Hernandez is writing, in which he reveals, denounces, lays bare, 
and reports on trends in the black market and other distortions 
of Cuban market relations at the present time. Jorge 
investigated these problems in response to calls from listeners 
to his radio program, who contacted him and asked him to look 
into the numerous irregularities on the fringes of or in the 
underground economy. 
  He has compiled over 1,000 files and documents on 
embezzlement, pilfering, corruption of various sorts, and the 
outcome of trials in cases that were detected. After five years 
of systematic work, he has prepared a number of graphics 
illustrating his investigations, plus pertinent contents of 
official reports, speeches, and information. 
  Between 1988 and 1990 my colleague followed 35 court trials. 
In reviewing his notes, Jorge found that 25 of these economic 
crimes took place in the capital, and the total damages to the 
nation came to 19.5 million pesos! In three cases the persons 
implicated were handling over 1 million pesos in each case, and 
in another 11 cases, over 100,000 pesos. 
  On 32 occasions over three persons were involved. In 19 
cases 
the administration was involved, and in another 19, businessmen, 
officials, accountants, and drivers were involved. Of these 35 
crimes, 94 percent happened in the area of material 
distribution, and within that category, 80 percent involved 
commerce, restaurants, and services. Fraud was a component of 
the modus operandi in 91 percent of the cases. 
  "All this shows," Jorge Rodriguez told me, "the organized 
character and the degree of complicity of people who, far from 
exercising positive authority, become lawbreakers. Another 
symptomatic feature is the occupational status of the criminals, 
for these are people with jobs, people who work, and in their 
position or job they become corrupted and corrupt others." 
  "In black market retailing," he added, "the situation is 
different: the biggest suppliers are individuals with jobs, and 
it is usually unemployed people who take the product to its 
final destination." 
<H5>  Four Years of the Black Market </H5>
  Jorge has become an expert on the underground economy. One 
of 
his most careful investigations always arouses interest. Over a 
four-year period he followed black market price trends of 19 
important consumer items: fats and oils, coffee, fluid, 
condensed and evaporated milk, beans, cigars, rum and beer, 
laundry detergents and bath soaps, butter, chicken, beef, and 
eggs. 
  A combination of one unit of each of these goods comes to a 
total, at the official price, of 17.29 [pesos]. Jorge began his 
calculations in the last quarter of 1990, and they have 
continued through 1993. 
  Underground sales have fluctuating prices that rise as 
demand 
increases and supply declines, just like in capitalism. So 
buying a pound, bottle, or part of the 19 products selected for 
the study would have cost between 129 and 150 pesos in September 
1990; between 185 and 226 in October 1991; and in July 1992 
these black market prices had risen to between 283 and 398 
pesos. Three months later, at the end of October, they were 
between 347 and 508 pesos. 
  On 31 January 1993, while the state market allowed Cubans to 
continue purchasing what was available of these items for the 
same minimum price they had cost years before, in the 
underground economy they cost between 392 and 570 pesos; three 
months later, at the end of April 1993, they cost between 489 
and 660 pesos. More recently, at the end of the first two weeks 
of October, these prices had almost doubled: between 788 and 
1,014 pesos in Cuban currency. 
  If a buyer in this market earned a minimum salary of 100 
pesos a month he could not have made these underground purchases 
unless he also got between 29 and 50 pesos in addition in 1991; 
between 158 and 233 in April 1992, and between 389 and 560 in 
April 1993. If he received a maximum salary of 450 pesos, three 
years ago he could have bought all these items easily, but on 30 
April 1993 he would have been 40 pesos short because by that 
time prices had risen between 28 and 38 times. In October the 
increase came to between 45 and 59 times. 
  All these factors will be used in forming individual and 
collective judgments of what is happening and what to do to 
diminish the harmful nature of these phenomena. It will at least 
be useful to speak out openly about this as a reality that must 
be temporary, and to inculcate in minors a sense of how this 
double standard of morality destroys the honor of society as a 
whole. 
  Making lies and simulation a standard of behavior is highly 
dangerous. Promoting or participating in embezzlement, bribery, 
or complicity in thefts from the state, and, therefore, from 
every other citizen, means a crisis of values that, aside from 
needing to be put down and punished, must quickly be rooted out 
from both institutions and individuals. It is vital to stop 
robbery and corruption and to force them back so they will not 
destroy the social conscience of our times. In the history of 
Cuba and in that of other countries, never have petty criminals 
figured among the legions of those who love and create. 
<H5>  Five Hundred People Surveyed </H5>
  What do people think, and how do they react, whether or not 
they are involved in activities that give rise to these 
situations? 
  Jorge Rodriguez Hernandez asked 500 workers, 44 percent of 
whom were under 30, and 54 percent of whom were male. They 
worked in commerce, restaurants, and services. They were 
employees in the Matadero and la Planta Habana, in food service, 
in factories, and light industry shops, in addition to 
professionals, middle management, and white-collar employees. 
They were members of the FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces] and 
MININT [Ministry of the Interior], plus some retired people, 
housewives, and people who were unemployed when the survey was 
conducted in 1991. 
  What did these 500 people say? Sixty-six percent said they 
were dissatisfied with the way material and financial resources 
were being protected; 57 percent said they were also unhappy 
about the use made of those resources. 
  Fifty-five percent felt that their standard of living was 
not 
the same as that of other members of society; 72 percent added 
that their needs were not being met as were those of other 
people. In spiritual and cultural matters, 57 percent said they 
believed those needs were being fulfilled on an equal basis. 
  Jorge asked people who work in restaurants, services, and 
commerce what they thought about the connection between their 
salary and their contribution to society. Sixty percent thought 
there was no correlation, and 64 percent thought there was no 
correlation with the quality and service they provided. And one 
interesting fact to note: between 61 and 66 percent of those 
polled in these sectors did believe that social property was 
well protected and used in terms of normal socialist aspirations. 
  The details of these evils obviously need much more than one 
investigative report. These really are issues that cry out for 
public thought and discussion. Starting with the crisis in 
authority affecting some people who should be controlling and 
protecting; and the decline of the community's scorn for a group 
of behaviors linked to crime and disorder.... 
  For, as my colleague Jorge Rodriguez noted: "Many of the 
efforts of the state leadership are devoted to plugging up the 
holes used by people engaging in shady deals. The other thing is 
that in Cuba there is no exploitation in production. 
Exploitation is privatized and the traffickers in money and 
merchandise are the ones engaging in exploitation." 
  We wondered over and over what can we do about this? What 
can 
be done, aside from doing our jobs responsibly, at a time when 
this entails greater sacrifices?
