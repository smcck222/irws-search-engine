<F P=106> [Editorial: "Let Us Fight for Equality and Against </F>
Egalitarianism"] 
  [Text] The major achievement of our Socialist revolution is 
equality of opportunity, rights, and duties for all citizens. 
This has wiped out a past in which a person came into the world 
with his destiny already laid out for him. A person was born 
either as a have or have-not, black or white, man or woman, and 
from that moment on, each individual was condemned to patterns 
of inequality from which only a few managed to escape with great 
difficulty. The revolution, after socializing the basic means of 
production, established the right to be born in a society that 
ensures access to education and health care services to all 
people. These are vital features enabling each individual to 
have the same opportunities to develop his physical and mental 
capabilities. Equality is not a gift from heaven, it is not a 
gift of nature; it is the result of a just distribution of the 
resources society produces through labor. 
  Viewed in this way, equality is not sustainable if it does 
not become a stimulus to increased and improved production. In 
other words, equality is not only a fine ideal of humanism; it 
must also be a condition for economic development. 
  If, today, Cuba can successfully meet the challenge of 
moving 
its economy into the changed world we are living in, this will 
largely be due to the fact that equality of access to education, 
health care, and work have, during all these years, created 
invaluable human resources. This is made up not only of a strong 
work force with a high educational level, but it is also 
composed of a pool of educated people unmatched in any other 
country with a similar level of development. One of the most 
valuable treasures of the revolution is the love for the ideals 
of justice and equality that the revolution planted in the 
people, especially in the young people who today constitute the 
majority of the nation. 
  But during all these years, we must admit, our national 
consciousness has not always discerned with proper clarity the 
limits between equality and egalitarianism. 
  We have frequently created rights of equality exceeding the 
nation's real economic possibilities; often practice has 
converted into egalitarianism an idea originally intended to 
stimulate production and efficiency based on differences in 
earnings. This lack of precise and realistic limits between 
equality and egalitarianism may be considered one of the 
deep-seated causes of our imperfect application of the socialist 
principle of distribution to each, in terms of both quantity and 
quality, according to his contribution. The full application of 
that principle, the foundation not only of the economy but of 
all true ethics and justice in socialist society, is a historic 
goal of the workers and their union movement. 
  Labor must be the leveling force for measuring each 
citizen's 
merit, prestige, and standard of living in a society of workers. 
In expressing these aspirations, we do not forget that at the 
present time when, for reasons we all know too well, the 
nation's economy is experiencing a critical situation, the most 
just and rational thing to do is to share these difficulties 
among all the Cuban people, thus in fact reducing the margin of 
differentiation based on each person's contribution to society. 
  Controlled, equitable, and rationed distribution, maximum 
support for employment, and the ample use of price subsidies 
have helped to save hundreds of thousands of Cubans from 
distress, bolstering our capacity for resistance and 
strengthening our national unity. 
  We Cuban workers fully support this profoundly human and 
revolutionary policy, but at the same time we must create an 
awareness that each step toward economic recovery the country 
takes must be accompanied by a revitalization of the role of 
salaries and their influence on individual consumption. We 
support the idea that as internal financial order and 
equilibrium are restored, we must intensify the use of salary 
and monetary gradations, as well as other material and moral 
incentives. This does not contradict, but reaffirms, socialist 
ideology. We believe payment for work must take into account the 
importance of the particular economic activity in order to 
stimulate areas and sectors that contribute most to the nation 
at a given moment. We believe that salary decisions to be made 
in the future should be based on the particular features of each 
geographic area and provide the greatest incentives for the 
least attractive but most essential jobs for the needs of 
specific goods or services. 
  We feel that in the future, decisions on the best rates, 
forms, and systems of payment should be more flexible and, as a 
rule, should be made in each entity. This must be accompanied 
with strict control of the use of the base salary and its 
relation to the goods or services made in terms of quantity, 
selection, and quality. 
  Finally, we maintain that wherever a rigorous managerial 
climate and labor and technological discipline exist and achieve 
improved economic results, the workers should be appropriately 
rewarded. In this way, we will work to establish the principle 
deeply held by our workers that the inequality to be rejected is 
not that which differentiates well earned incomes, but equality 
based on equal treatment for persons of different behavior and 
ability in their work.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Revitalizing Wages and Other Forms of Material </F>
Incentives"] 
  [Text] What motivates a person to work in socialism? What 
balance should be established between material and moral 
incentives? Does a material incentive inevitably create 
uncontrollable trends toward mercantilism and individualism? 
  This may be the best possible moment to answer these key 
questions that we Cuban workers have asked ourselves repeatedly 
throughout our revolutionary history. 
  Now is the best moment, and, as never before, it is 
essential 
to establish the greatest rational and realistic cooperation 
among the economy, politics, and ideology. This does not mean 
embracing a vulgar practice that rejects essential features of 
revolutionary humanism or leads us to confuse what is necessary 
with what is desirable. It is the best moment because the 
present situation strengthens our will to correct errors we had 
found earlier in the organization of labor and salaries and in 
our interpretation of the conditions influencing labor behavior. 
  It seems that if one current economic issue needs special 
analysis because of its enormous, direct, and daily influence on 
the workers' standard of living and social education, it is the 
organization of labor and salaries. 
  So it is not surprising that Cuban society is now focusing 
on 
this crucial issue. 
  It is clearly a vital goal, and not just economic, but 
ideological as well, to develop formulas and practices seeking 
the best combination between material and moral incentives. 
  The unions, representing the workers' vital interests, are 
absolutely committed to seeking and expanding formulas that by 
promoting the nation's economic reorganization, will safeguard 
the ideal of a collectivist and just society with solidarity. 
  We support without reservation the view that a well-founded 
material incentive, which is actually a fair share for the 
performance of a social duty, is in fact a moral incentive of 
the greatest importance. 
  The social evaluation shown by providing a material 
incentive 
to the individual corresponding to his contribution does not in 
any way create contradictions detrimental to the worker's 
morale, just as it cannot be alleged that an exclusively moral 
incentive can satisfy needs and aspirations of other sorts. 
There has always been talk of a combination of both types of 
incentives. Now is the time to interpret fully the meaning of 
the word "combination" that, in chemistry, for example, means an 
"intimate union of the molecules of two substances." Just as 
water is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, for us the 
motivation for labor indissolubly combines both material and 
moral factors. As we have already said, we Cuban workers must 
promote a process of revitalization of the role of salaries and 
other forms of material incentives so that we can differentiate 
to a greater degree the levels of individual consumption in 
relation to each person's contribution. 
  It is important to understand the evolving, gradual, and 
very 
complex character of this process, so that we do not create 
false expectations or unjustified demands, and so this will not 
be identified with former experiments that were rightly 
criticized. The dynamics of this process will be shaped by the 
restoration of internal financial order and equilibrium and by 
the economic recovery steps that Cuba takes in its strategy of 
reentering the world economy. 
  Moreover, the policy of renewed emphasis on material 
incentives would be inappropriate if it were initially extended 
without discrimination, with the same weight given both to 
productive sectors and to those that do not directly create 
material value. 
  Among productive activities we need to distinguish those 
which are capable of definitely generating high foreign currency 
earnings, decreasing convertible currency costs, or which have a 
special significance in the current strategy of resistance and 
development. These activities, called multipliers because of 
their ability to help revitalize the economy in general, are the 
first to which the motivating force of greater material 
incentives should come, with the necessary criterion of maximum 
efficiency and stringent discipline. 
  It is no waste of time to reiterate that the unions have the 
duty to demand that in any case, material incentives must also 
be contingent upon a substantial increase in labor productivity. 
All that is done to boost productivity and efficiency in these 
vanguard activities, along with steps for financial improvement, 
will have repercussions on the dissemination of these incentives 
toward more and more sectors of the economy and toward 
nonproductive services. 
  What is done to revitalize the national economy will in one 
way or another reach the entire working population, starting by 
increasing the purchasing power of present salaries. 
  It can be seen with enormous optimism that wherever the 
experiment of stimulating more vigorously effort and excellence 
in work has been tried, the immediate results have more than 
compensated the investment made. 
  Still, increases in material incentives should not be 
conceived solely in terms of raising salaries and giving workers 
in these centers special access to the consumption of specific 
goods and services. This simplistic view would lead to failure. 
  Wherever unquestionable economic gains promoted in large 
part 
by greater incentives exist, there are also present satisfaction 
in work well done, pride in doing one's duty, conscious 
acceptance of discipline that is desirable and appropriate for 
each member of the work unit, a precise definition of every 
person's objectives, functions, and tasks, understanding of the 
social usefulness of the work done, and the enjoyment of better 
environmental and working conditions. These experiences show 
that when the workers are fully and effectively motivated, it 
contributes to their ideological formation that, as we know, is 
expressed in the execution of their responsibilities, in their 
actions. 
  Beyond words, the essential and most direct way for the 
worker to take part in the construction of socialist society is 
by doing his job. Everything done to promote the value of labor 
forms a part of the sacred struggle for human dignity. 
  It may be worthwhile to say that, though we are speaking of 
the role of material incentives, we do not underestimate the 
importance of moral incentives. Doing that would once again 
polarize the focus on this issue, by denying that both form an 
inseparable whole. 
  What we want to do is call attention to the necessary view 
that a material incentive linked organically to decisive 
political, ideological, and moral aspects, and associated more 
and more with collective effort, with the cooperation and 
socialization of labor, far from damaging revolutionary 
awareness, must and can help to strengthen it. 
  This is the deeply held conviction of the Cuban union 
movement.

<F P=106> [Statement by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at the Los </F>
Pinos Presidential Residence on 10 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] The Government of the Republic has the essential 
duty of ensuring the validity of the state of law and the safety 
of the citizens. Therefore, it is willing to undertake actions 
to prevent the dynamics of the serious events that have taken 
place in Chiapas State from leading to more confrontations. 
This requires political decisions in favor of the nation, and 
which are a recognition of what did not work properly. 
  In order to guarantee full adherence to the Constitution and 
the law in the public decisions demanded under the 
circumstances, and in order to open efficacious channels for 
reconciliation and justice in Chiapas State, based on Article 82 
of the Constitution, we have agreed to: 
  1. Appoint Dr. Jorge Carpizo as government secretary. His 
mission will be to bear the responsibility of that office to 
guarantee that all the decisions necessary to restore the 
tranquility in Chiapas State as soon as possible, and maintain 
it in the rest of the country, will be in strict accordance with 
the law; and also to guarantee that the 1994 federal elections 
will be carried out in strict accordance with our Constitution 
and the new standing legislation. 
  This morning I accepted the resignation of Jose Patrocinio 
Gonzalez Blanco-Garrido. 
  2. In light of the need to create a framework, an agenda, 
and procedures for reconciliation of the conflict in Chiapas 
State, while meeting with Mr. Manuel Camacho Solis, we discussed 
his feelings about fulfilling this task. He said that as it is 
such an important cause for the nation, his work would require 
very broad flexibility for action in society and permanent 
access to the highest level in the government. 
  As it is in fact a totally new topic, he will be the 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. He will 
have the support of, and permanent access to the president of 
the Republic. 
  On his part, he will seek to open spaces for society to 
contribute to the reconciliation in Chiapas State, aside from 
the general context. [sentence as heard] 
  Mr. Manuel Camacho, asked me to allow him to carry out that 
duty without a salary and without creating any new government 
organization. 
  3. Mr. Manuel Tello Macias, will be the foreign relations 
secretary. Ambassador Tello Macias, a career diplomat, will 
guide the foreign policy with firmness and prudence, based on 
historic principles that shall always care for the national 
sovereignty. 
  4. Mr. Diego Valadez will be the attorney general of the 
Republic. Mr. Valadez, a well-known attorney, was until today 
the attorney general of the Federal District. He has broad 
experience in government duties and administration of justice. 
His instructions are to fulfill and enforce the Constitution 
and the laws, while maintaining the guidelines of conduct and 
work that have been characteristic of this institution. 
  Mr. Rene Gonzalez de la Vega, will be the acting attorney 
general of the Federal District. 
  I have sworn in all these public servants and they will 
immediately assume their new duties. 
  With these guidelines and political decisions, the 
government 
of the Republic will strengthen the law and respect for human 
rights, and open channels for conciliation without ceasing, at 
any moment, to guarantee safety in Chiapas State. 
  The Mexican Army, with loyalty and patriotism spawned from 
its historic roots and its popular origin, in fulfilling its 
constitutional responsibility and in accordance with the policy 
of the government of the Republic, will continue to guarantee 
the safety of the citizens in Chiapas; and, together with the 
proper authorities, will contribute to keeping individuals or 
groups from seeking to disrupt, through violence, the 
tranquility of the families and the harmony of the country. 
  Thank you very much.

  [Text] Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, is continuing his 
political campaign. On 6 January he met with leaders from the 
Union of Railroad Workers of the Republic of Mexico [STFRM] and 
told them that economic competitiveness, improved trade 
procedures, and increasingly efficient services would be 
inconceivable without the railroad industry. He emphasized that 
the railroad sector must play a very important role in 
turn-of-the-century Mexico. Colosio pledged to promote a new 
phase of regional development in Mexico in which the railroad 
will be fundamental. 
  The presidential candidate asserted that Mexico will become 
stronger as its regions become more closely integrated, thereby 
increasing and improving trade. Colosio described the railroad 
workers as heirs of the tradition, effort, and tenacity to 
promote Mexico's growth. 
  The STFRM's national leader Antonio Castellanos Tovar spoke 
on the union's behalf.

<F P=106> [Report by Roxie Wasking Vasquez from the "Vector 21" </F>
newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] In officially opening the elections campaign for the 
21 August 1994 elections, Government Secretary Patrocinio 
Gonzalez Garrido, acting as director of the General Council of 
the Federal Electoral Institute [IFE], has called for respect 
for the law. 
  Without mentioning the Chiapas conflict, he issued his first 
statement since the beginning of the armed struggle in that 
state. He said that violence is the negation of politics and 
represents backwardness, disorder, anarchy, and the destruction 
of democracy. 
  The government secretary appeared gaunt, nervous, and 
worried. He said only the law can guarantee legal security and 
democratic life. He noted that, within a state of law, it is 
always possible to punish criminals. Gonzalez also insisted 
that violence does not permit the reaching of agreements. Here 
is what he said: 
  [Gonzalez] "Society, the political parties, and the 
government reject violence as a means of producing political and 
social change. As the president has said, there is nothing that 
can inhibit Mexicans' ability to reach agreements and to talk 
among themselves. The federal government has reiterated its 
commitment to safeguarding and strengthening a state of law with 
the security and peace demanded by development, as well as with 
dialogue and agreements as means for securing fundamental 
cooperation. All of this requires laws and compliance with the 
law." 
  After delivering this message, the meeting turned into a 
debate on the situation in Chiapas. The political parties 
represented at the IFE General Council have rejected violence, 
but there is criticism about the methods the Mexican Army and 
the federal government have used to put down the uprising. 
  A calm and articulate Porfirio Munoz Ledo [leader of the 
Party of the Democratic Revolution -- PRD] engaged the attention 
of his listeners by charging that the government controls the 
public forces and that the Indians have become cannon fodder. 
Munoz Ledo, speaking as the PRD representative, said the 
inefficient and segregationist policies of the regime should be 
questioned. He denied that the political forces have a common 
position on the Chiapas events. We, he said, demand moderation, 
legality, dialogue, timely information, and effective support 
and help for the people. We also demand respect for human rights 
and basic solutions, as well as an end to the impunity of 
government officials and political agents. Here is what 
Porfirio Munoz Ledo said: 
  [Munoz] "The executive branch has the constitutional 
obligation to determine when, how soon, and how officials under 
its jurisdiction should be changed. Our responsibility is to 
continue struggling for the renewal and purge of the electoral 
authorities at all levels." 
  Alberto Carrillo Armenta, representative of the Cardenist 
Front for National Reconstruction Party, also called for a 
nonmilitary solution in Chiapas. He said this year's elections 
process cannot be initiated if there is a state of emergency. 
He demanded security measures for candidates who, like the 
Cardenist Front's candidate -- Rafael Aguilar -- will be 
carrying out a political campaign in that state of the Republic. 
  The Popular Socialist Party, represented by Jesus Carlos 
Hernandez, called for common sense in the debates on, and in the 
solution of, the Chiapas conflict. He rejected foreign meddling 
in the region. 
  The National Action Party also participated in the debate. 
Juan de Dios Castro spoke in a very emotional tone. He tried 
to stir the political awareness of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI], the federal government, and all 
Mexicans. He said the conflict in Chiapas could extend to other 
regions of the federation because there is poverty in all of 
them. He explained that the individual guarantees of the Mexican 
people cannot be violated because of what is happening in 
Chiapas. 
  He recalled, quoting a South American leader, that changes 
will take place with or without politicians -- they just come. 
Here is what Juan de Dios Castro said: 
  [Castro] "Changes will take place with or without us. If 
they take place without us, this will sadden me. The people are 
making demands. They are shouting demands that we make 
structural changes. They are also demanding respect for the 
Constitution." 
  The PRI had three of its militants at the meeting. Two of 
them are official IFE representatives -- Santiago Nate and 
Amador Rodriguez Lozano -- and the third one, Miguel Gonzalez 
Avelar, is an adviser to the Chamber of Deputies. The PRI 
representatives said their party is not evading a debate, but 
they asked that the issue be discussed at a forum other than IFE. 
  Amador Rodriguez Lozano said democracy is not a birthright 
of 
political parties but, rather, of society. He said democracy 
does not equate with irreconcilable division, and he added that 
no attention should be paid to apocalyptic visions. He said 
there are other problems that require the attention of IFE's 
General Council. Here is Amador Rodriguez Lozano: 
  [Rodriguez] "The position we must adopt at this first 
meeting 
should not be one of searching for a leading role in the 
discussion of this problem. We should center our attention on 
the many difficult matters we have ahead of us -- matters that 
we will have to discuss repeatedly, passionately, and often." 
  Miguel Gonzalez Avelar said there should be no confusion 
concerning the Mexican Army's involvement. He said that 
communities have the right to demand, as in the case of Chiapas, 
the presence of national forces. He said it would not be right 
for members of the federation not to expect to demand and 
receive help from the forces of the federation. 
  Gonzalez added that our duty is not to dull our awareness. 
He recalled that in Chiapas there are rebel minorities, just as 
those who killed [Mexican Independence hero Miguel] Hidalgo were 
also in the minority, as were those who brought a foreign prince 
to Mexico and those who killed [Mexican patriot Francisco] 
Madero. Here is what Gonzalez said: 
  [Gonzalez] "Today there is this faceless violence from a 
well- organized group that unfortunately and tragically includes 
young people aremed with wooden rifles who remind us of the 
Cristera War [between government forces and Catholic militants] 
when young people charged federal soldiers to silence their 
rifle barrels with little wax balls, believing this could be 
done because the little wax balls had been previously blessed by 
their pastors. 
  "In any event, these groups are proposing substituting the 
party system for the unalterable will of rifles." 
  The first regular IFE session is continuing. It has 
officially opened the 21 August elections process to renew the 
Senate, the Chamber of Deputies, the Presidency, and the House 
of Representatives. The session continues. The members will be 
discussing other issues. Discussions on the Chiapas events 
concluded at 1200.

  [Text] Socorro Diaz, deputy secretary for civilian 
protection at the Government Secretariat, read today a 28-page 
document with important information on the armed groups that 
have provoked violence in Chiapas State. She said the so-called 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] is an extremist 
organization. 
  [Begin Diaz recording, in progress] ...violent, 
professional, 
and well trained. Its profile is highly ideological and uses a 
language that is characteristic of extremist guidelines. [end

  The armed group includes the participation of ideologists 
and 
clergy; there are medics and transmission technicians, and it is 
comprised of Mexicans and foreigners. Its operation strategy 
for 1993 consisted of advocating the invasion of lands and 
provoking an overall violence. In certain cases it kidnaps 
children to force their parents to join the armed group. 
  Referring to the group's weapons, Diaz said it has machine 
guns, shotguns, revolvers, and sophisticated weapons that are 
suited for guerrilla warfare. The weapons were manufactured 
mainly in the United States, Russia, and the UK. 
  [Begin Diaz recording] The so-called EZLN appeared in 1993 
in five municipalities of Chiapas State--Ocosingo, Las 
Margaritas, Comitan, Altamirano, and Chanal. It has an 
organized network of activists cells that are in permanent 
contact with civilian band radios. It has 15 training centers 
in various municipalities; six of them are located in Las 
Margaritas, five in Ocosingo, two in Sabanillas, one in 
Altamirano, and one in Chanal. [end recording] 
  The report read by Mrs. Socorro Diaz is based on information 
that was provided by the National Defense Secretariat and the 
Attorney General's Office. She said the group has martial arts 
instructors and health promoters. Each squad of activists is 
comprised of one sergeant, one corporal, one radio operator, one 
health promoter, and 20 activists. The group has 172 civilian 
band radio stations in its camps, and authorities have found 
propaganda of the Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's 
Union Party [Procup], which the group supports by distributing 
its publications. 
  The aggressor group is comprised of and supported by various 
extremist organizations. They have safe houses and assembly 
centers where they show political-revolutionary movies to the 
people. Diaz said many of its leaders have already been 
identified.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Eduardo Campos from Tapachula, Chiapas </F>
State; from the "This Sunday" program--live] 
  [Text] We are in the city of Tapachulas, Chiapas State, to 
where we have just returned following an extensive visit along 
the border area with Guatemala, the border that divides these 
two countries. We were in Ciudad de Hidalgo, the last town in 
Chiapas, and crossed into Tecun Uman, the first town in 
Guatemala. During our visit, the Televisa news team assigned to 
this area was able to learn that people have no problem in 
crossing illegally into Mexico from Guatemala. It is believed 
that approximately 200 people can enter Mexico every day just 
through Ciudad de Hidalgo en route to the center of the country 
or the interior of Chiapas. Different immigration officials 
have confirmed this information. They have said surveillance in 
the area between Guatemala and Mexico is low, meaning that a 
large number of people is easily entering Chiapas, coming from 
Central America or even South America. 
  We also visited the highways around the border area, linking 
Tapachulas. We were able to see that there is little 
surveillance, but in the major areas of Tapachula--such as the 
airport, a Mexican Petroleum station, and a large park or 
zoo--the Mexican Army has strong security. Also participating 
in that operation are members of the state and municipal police 
and the Attorney General's Office. In addition to soldiers and 
Federal Judicial Police, state, and municipal police agents, 
Federal Highway Police agents are deployed at the airport; they 
are not letting cars go near the airport's gate. One has to 
walk 150 to 200 meters from where cars are parked to be able to 
enter the airport. 
  [Unidentified anchorman] Going back to your visit along the 
border, did you see Guatemalan soldiers on the Guatemalan side? 
  [Campos] The military presence on the Guatemala side is even 
smaller than on the Mexican side. On the Mexican side, we saw 
three immigration officials on the ground; two others are 
conducting an inspection in a patrol car. On the Guatemalan 
side, we only saw two people manning this border area. 
  We specifically asked Mr. Freddy Chicago, who is on the 
Mexican side, if the flow of people entering Mexico or Chiapas, 
more precisely, has gone up. He replied that it has risen 
considerably. On the Suchiate River side, which is where people 
cross illegally, the number has also risen considerably. 
Crossing the Suchiate River right now.... [pauses] Because the 
river between Ciudad de Hidalgo and Tecun Uman is merely 50 
centimeters deep, many people walk across, and many others use 
rafts consisting of boards tied to inner tubes. They make it 
across the border without problems.

<F P=106> [Report by Abelardo Sanchez] </F>
  [Text] Ocotal -- With regard to the mysterious identity of 
Commander "Marcos," leader of the Mexican Zapatista guerrilla 
group, the newspaper LA PRENSA offers its readers a photograph 
of Marcos Rojas, an internationalist guerrilla who joined the 
armed struggle of the FSLN [Sandinist national Liberation Front] 
during the liberation war. 
  During the 1980's, Rojas was a member of the Sandinist 
People's Army staff in Ocotal. He went by two names "The Compa 
Marcos" and "The Mexican." Also, he had a daughter with Luisa 
Amelia Sierra, an Ocotal resident who lived in the "Lacayo 
Farfan" neighborhood. 
  Sierra, who was attending Managua's National Autonomous 
University of Nicaragua at the time, was killed in a traffic 
accident between Sebaco and "San Benito." After Sierra died, 
Marcos returned to Mexico, taking his daughter Araceli with him. 
Prior to leaving, he told his FSLN "comrades" that if they 
wanted to contact him, to call 757-4723 in Mexico City. 
  Rojas used to hang around the church entrance in Ocotal 
where 
he would meet with certain FSLN sympathizers to teach them the 
"Workers to Power" FSLN song and other FSLN slogans that were in 
fashion back then. 
  Some people who looked at the photograph of the "Zapatista" 
guerrilla published by LA PRENSA on Thursday, 6 January, 
estimate his age to be 40 years old, which is the same age as 
the Mexican Marcos Rojas. 
  Rojas left Nicaragua in 1985, six years after the triumph of 
the revolution. Before he left Ocotal he said: "I am leaving, 
but I am taking all of Sandinist Nicaragua in my heart. But like 
the revolutionary that I am, I am leaving because I am needed in 
my homeland (Mexico)." 
  It was difficult for LA PRENSA to gather all the information 
on Rojas. His photograph was obtained from a file handled by 
FSLN members. These were the steps taken to establish the 
identity of the mysterious "Marcos," chief of the Zapatista 
National Liberation Army (EZLN). 
  Is this only a coincidence? Two different people with the 
same name, or is Marcos Rojas the man who heads the guerrilla 
movement of the so-called Zapatistas?

<F P=106> [From the "TV-13 Sunday" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The daily EXCELSIOR published today a report on the 
alleged leaders of the armed groups in Chiapas. The report 
contains a list attributed to the Attorney General's Office 
[PGR] that includes priests, legislators, teachers, and PRD 
[Party of the Democratic Revolution] figures are among the rebel 
leaders. 
  Attorney General Jorge Carpizo today sent a letter to 
EXCELSIOR editor Regino Diaz Redondo stating that the PGR has 
not provided that information. It is obvious, Carpizo indicated 
in his letter, that the document does exist, but it has not come 
from the PGR. The official added that as far as he an the PGR 
are concerned, having a series of rumors and false statements 
attributed to them constitutes the most serious blow that could 
be dealt. Carpizo said the rumors are intended to destroy what 
has been built through much toil and that they harm the 
foundation for dispensing justice.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier de la Torre; from the "Good Morning From </F>
Mexico" newscast] 
  [Excerpt] The Army is continuing to pursue the rebels in 
Altos de Chiapas. The clashes have not stopped, especially near 
San Cristobal de las Casas. The first signs of an eventual 
dialogue with the armed groups have emerged. 
  The clashes continued between the Army and the rebels in Los 
Altos de Chiapas for the eighth consecutive day. The Army has 
repelled a rebel attack against the Rancho Nuevo Military 
Barracks near San Cristobal de las Casas. The roads to the 
areas of conflict remain closed. 
  During the pursuit operations, authorities found a Pemex 
[Mexican Petroleum] vehicle from which the rebels stole 1.5 tons 
of dynamite 31 December. The truck was found in Guadalupe 
Tepeyac, a town thought to be the rebels' stronghold, where it 
has been confirmed they are still holding captive the former 
Chiapas State governor, Absalon Castellanos, and approximately 
100 social security employees of the town. Thousands of Indians 
and peasants are fleeing from the areas of conflict to seek 
refuge in San Cristobal de las Casas, a city being reinforced by 
the Army. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Samuel Prieto Rodriguez from Chiapas Department; </F>
from the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] 
  [Text] The National Network of Civilian Human Rights 
Organizations again tried on Sunday to pass a military roadblock 
outside of San Cristobal de las Casas in an effort to go to 
Ocosingo and Altamirado. On Saturday, the organization had sent 
a letter to National Defense Secretary General Antonio Riviello 
Bazan and 31st Military Garrison Commander Gaston Melchaca, 
informing them of the intention to make the visit based on 
Articles 6 and 11 of the Constitution. 
  [Begin recording of human rights leader Martin Faz, 
indentified by caption] If a legitimate and well-grounded 
impediment exists which would keep us from carrying out this 
objective, please, let us know as soon as possible at the Plaza 
Domingo Hotel, telephone 8-19-27. The above statement is based 
on Article 8 of the Constitution. [end recording] 
  About 16 of the organization's representatives, including 
five from the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights 
and other U.S. groups, as well as an Indian representative from 
that country, left in two station wagons and headed toward the 
military roadblock located on the road to Rancho Nuevo, followed 
by a motorcade of 50 cars of reporters. At the roadblock, they 
were told to return to San Cristobal to meet with CNDH [National 
Human Rights Committee] Chairman Jorge Madrazo. The press was 
advised to meet with Eloy Cantu Segovia, a senior official of 
the Government Secretariat. These officials would inform them of 
those places to which they are allowed access. 
  In view of this situation, and because they were unable to 
locate Madrazo, the nongovernment groups left in the afternoon 
toward the roadblock on the Tenejapa road. On the way there, 
one of the vehicles ran over an Indian, but fortunately without 
major consequences. 
  There are combat vehicles in midtown San San Cristobal de 
las 
Casas, which are reinforcing military surveillance. Cantu 
Segovia and Madrazo issued no statement on Sunday afternoon. It 
is worth mentioning that the area's military roadblocks do not 
merely consist of tangible objects.

<F P=106> [From the ECO news service] </F>
  [Text] The government of Mexico State issued a press 
communique yesterday reiterating its decision to apply the 
necessary measures to preserve state residents' integrity and 
security. It will also take the necessary surveillance measures 
to protect utility installations. 
  Meanwhile, the Federal District Attorney General's Office 
has 
reported that dynamite was used in the car bomb explosion in 
Mexico City Plaza Universidad Shopping Center on early Saturday 
morning [8 January]. Specialized personnel collected samples at 
the explosion site that consisted of metal fragments and 
synthetic materials of the vehicle used in the explosion. The 
study led authorities to rule out the possibility that a device 
made up of powder only was used; residues of this material were 
not found. Authorities also ruled out the use of a material 
called anfo, which is composed of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil, 
because residues of this product were not found either. 
  Mexico City Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez spoke this Sunday 
about security in Mexico City. Authorities from the capital met 
on Sunday with residents of the capital's 16 political districts 
to talk about security matters in Mexico City. In an auditorium 
in Benito Juarez District, Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez spoke to 
Mexico City residents and said surveillance operations in public 
buildings, schools, and other areas have been intensified by the 
different police corps. 
  [Begin Aguilera recording] The city is in peace. The city is 
continuing to conduct normal activity. [end recording] 
  Aguilera Gomez said he will keep citizens permanently 
informed about the events that are taking place in the capital. 
Diego Balades, federal district attorney general, also spoke 
during the event. 
  [Begin Balades recording] The mayor has said there is no 
cause for alarm, and this is so. There is no reason to be 
alarmed. We must simply remain in a state of alert. We are in 
a state of alert, both society and authorities. The 
authorities' cooperation is permanent and constant in Mexico 
City, as well as in the entire country. [end recording] 
  Representatives of the various Mexico City districts also 
participated in the meeting. Meanwhile, Mr. Sergio Fuentes, a 
resident of Istapalapa, said the following: 
  [Begin Fuentes recording] We want to make it clear that we, 
Mexicans, are used to living in peace. All of our differences 
have always been resolved within the framework of the law. [end 
recording] 
  Those also present were the 16 district representatives and 
Juan Jose Osorio, leader of the Assembly of Representatives, 
Rene Monterrubio, secretary general of the Traffic Department, 
and Jose Monroy, president of the Mexico City Advisory Council.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Pereyra and Marisa Lopez from the </F>
"Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] 
  [Excerpts] [Pereyra] Mexico's 32 departments register 
different poverty levels. Experts feel that poverty is 
ancestral since its origins date back 500 years. Oaxaca State 
has a poverty level of 11 percent and is the poorest state in 
the country. Mexico City, with a poverty level of 0.1 percent, 
is the least impoverished. Chiapas State's 111 municipalities 
are poor. It is the second most impoverished state in the 
country. The poverty there, as anywhere else, generates 
ignorance. There is poverty, not misery, in Chiapas. Poverty 
and the ignorance of those suffering from its consequences have 
become a breeding ground for professional terrorists who have 
pit the people of Chiapas -- luckily a minority of them -- 
against their institutions. Rural areas have the highest poverty 
levels in this state. Monoculture is the chief occupation of 
the people here. [passage omitted] It is in these areas where 
the level of production and service infrastructure is very low. 
About 60 percent of Chiapas residents live in rural areas. 
Moreover, 99 percent of the state's 16,400 towns are rural. 
Poverty in Chiapas has many indicators. For instance, 60 
percent of the economically active population earns minimum 
wages. Indians make up one-fifth of the population. Also, 19 
percent of the people have no income. The illiteracy rate is 30 
percent. There are no roads. [passage omitted] 
  [Lopez] Chiapas has a population of approximately 3.6 
million. The current strife zone is located in six of its 111 
municipalities. Four of these municipalities have a population 
of a little more than 360,000 persons, or 11.8 percent of the 
population. The majority of the people in Ocosingo, San 
Cristobal de las Casas, Las Margaritas, and Comitan de 
Dominguez, the site of last week's clashes, work the land. That 
is where one cause of the conflict lies. With almost 
nonexistent land reform following the victory of the revolution 
and inadequate land distribution during the Cardenas eras, 
pressure on the land has displaced a large number of people, 
mostly Indians. [passage omitted]

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 10 Jan (EFE) -- 
The Mexican Armed Forces are preparing a large offensive against 
the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) in Chiapas State 
and have moved approximately 15,000 soldiers, 40 tanks, planes, 
helicopters, and paratroopers to that southern area. The "final 
offensive" to be launched by the military this week will have 
the town of Guadalupe Tepeyac -- the only one still under rebel 
control -- as its main objective, the Mexican media asserted 
today, Monday. 
  Several Social Security employees have indicated that 
approximately 200 rebels are holding approximately 100 Guadalupe 
Tepeyac Hospital physicians and nurses hostage at those 
installations. The hospital is 800 meters from the Guatemalan 
border. 
  Unofficial reports also indicate that former Chiapas 
Governor 
General Absalon Castellanos could also be held in Guadalupe 
Tepeyac. Castellanos was kidnapped by the rebels a day after the 
conflict began, and the rebels announced that they intended to 
subject him to a summary trial. 
  None of the reporters assigned to the area or the residents 
of the cities negatively affected by the conflict have been able 
to confirm reports on the Armed Forces offensive because the 
roads that lead to the area have been closed by the Mexican Army. 
  There continues to be an important movement of troops at the 
colonial city of San Cristobal de las Casas, the entrances to 
which are guarded by tanks, and according to the media, large 
numbers of soldiers are constantly arriving. Military 
checkpoints in the Chiapas jungle and mountain regions have also 
been reinforced. Not even the civilians who want to take 
potable water, medicine, and food to relatives trapped in the 
conflict area are allowed to pass. Local radio stations are 
constantly broadcasting messages requesting help for the 
besieged residents or reports that they are well so relatives in 
other regions can be at ease. 
  On 1 January the EZLN took up arms against the Mexican 
Government, declared war on the Armed Forces, and seized several 
communities. Since then the confrontations have not stopped, 
and according to unofficial reports, at least 200 are dead and 
1,000 injured. 
  In its counteroffensive, the Mexican Army managed to push 
the 
rebels to the mountainous area surrounding San Cristobal de las 
Casas and is currently searching for the guerrilla's general 
headquarters, which is hidden in Lacandona jungle. 
  The last reported clash took place at the 31st Military Zone 
garrison in Rancho Nuevo, 10 km from Ocosingo, yesterday, 
Sunday. The National Defense Secretariat has not reported 
casualties on either side. 
  On that same day the Army arrested Mexican priest Isidro 
Guillermo Badillo Brana at the border between Chiapas and 
Tabasco States. He is charged with commanding a group of rebels 
and was transferred to the military installations in San 
Cristobal de las Casas. The local church has demanded the 
parish priest's immediate dismissal and announced that if it is 
not done the church will ask for intervention by the National 
Human Rights Commission (CNDH.) 
  According to the National Defense Secretariat, the 106 
rebels 
who have been arrested revealed important information regarding 
the EZLN's organization, its ties with Central American rebel 
groups, and the orientation of its leaders. The Attorney 
General's Office reported in a communique that according to the 
rebels' testimony, at least two of the EZLN leaders are 
Guatemalans -- Commanders Marcos and Jesus -- and it is they 
who headed the takeover of San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  The Judicial Police and the Army have begun to search for 
both leaders, who apparently participated in the Rancho Nuevo 
clash at the beginning of the hostilities when five soldiers 
were killed.

  [Text] Mexico City, 10 Jan (EFE) -- The Mexico City Mayor's 
Office announced today, Monday, the adoption of measures to 
prevent members or supporters of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) from entering the metropolis. 
  The measures include an exhaustive review of the baggage of 
all the travelers entering the city by land or air. The 
municipality will also establish an emergency telephone service 
to protect citizens in case of attacks. 
  "It is not a matter of militarizing the metropolis or 
frightening the citizens. These are only measures to prevent 
attacks such as those that have taken place in neighboring 
cities," Regent (Mayor) Manuel Aguilera Gomez stated. 
  He warned that officials who check baggage will not be 
allowed to violate the people's right to free movement "because 
we cannot allow individual guarantees to be trampled upon due to 
a transitory situation." 
  In addition, police surveillance will be reinforced at 
schools, places of public assembly and recreation, public 
transportation centers, sewage an potable water treatment 
plants, and electricity plants 
  The mayor commented that approximately 20 bomb threats had 
been received at several government offices, private firms, and 
newspaper offices between Friday and Saturday, all of which 
turned out to be false alarms. 
  EL NACIONAL has reported that the Judicial Police took 90 
Chiapas residents into custody for questioning. The people 
arrived in Mexico City on Sunday, supposedly under contract by a 
firm. The police released them 16 hours later.

  [Text] Comitan, Mexico, 10 Jan (EFE) -- The Zapatista 
National Liberation Army (EZLN) today released approximately 80 
social security workers it had held hostage in Guadalupe 
Tepeyac, which is about 800 meters from the Guatemalan border. 
  The workers, who walked 40 km to the community of Pimienta, 
said there could be about 100 EZLN members in Guadalupe Tepeyac 
and that they had reports that former Chiapas Governor Absalon 
Castellanos Dominguez might be in that town. Castellanos, who 
was Chiapas governor from 1982 to 1988, was kidnapped on 2 
January by EZLN members and his whereabouts remain unknown.

<F P=106> [Report by special envoy Antonio Ortega] </F>
  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 10 Jan (AFP) -- 
The guerrilla members of the Zapatista National Liberation Army 
(EZLN) consider unacceptable the Mexican Government's conditions 
for a consultation, according to a communique dated 6 January 
and divulged on Monday in San Cristobal de las Casas. 
  "The `consultation' conditions that the government is trying 
to impose on us are unacceptable (....) We will not put down 
our weapons until our demands are accepted," it is stated in the 
EZLN communique, written in four pages and sent to TIEMPO 
newspaper in San Cristobal, Chiapas State. 
  The guerrilla members demand "recognition of the EZLN as a 
belligerent force," a "cease-fire by both parties throughout the 
territory involved in the conflict," and the "withdrawal of 
federal troops from all the communities, with full respect for 
human rights." A communique from the Clandestine Indian 
Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the EZLN also demands 
an end to the "indiscriminate bombardment of rural towns." 
  "Our troops pledge to respect those conditions (cease-fire 
and others) if the federal government does likewise. Otherwise, 
our troops will continue to advance toward the country's 
capital," the EZLN emphasizes. The text also states: "Since 1 
January this year our Zapatista troops began a series of 
political-military actions the goal of which is to let the 
people of Mexico and the rest of the world know under what 
conditions millions of Mexicans, particularly we the Indians, 
live and die." "The actions we started prove our decision to 
fight for our most basic rights through the only means left by 
the government authorities," the text adds. 
  The rebels issued an appeal "to the U.S. Government and 
peoples. They ask the U.S. people to initiate actions of 
solidarity and support for our fellow citizens and ask the U.S. 
Government to suspend all economic and military assistance to 
the Mexican Federal Government, which is a dictatorial 
government that does not respect human rights, and because such 
aid will be used to massacre the peoples of Mexico." 
  The guerrillas state that "our EZLN does not have in its 
ranks, its organization, or its leadership, any foreigner, nor 
has it ever received any support or advice from revolutionary 
movements of other countries or foreign governments." "The 
report that there are Guatemalans trained in the neighboring 
country in our ranks are stories invented by the federal 
government to undermine our cause," the communique states. 
  The EZLN also rejected any links with the Guatemalan 
National 
Revolutionary Unity, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation 
Front of El Salvador, or the church. "The EZLN commanders and 
troops are mostly Chiapas Indians. That is because we, the 
Indians, represent the most humiliated and dispossessed sector 
of Mexico," the communique says. It adds that the EZLN also 
includes Mexicans of other social levels and different states of 
our country." 
  Commander "Marcos" who signed the communique asked the 
newspaper TIEMPO to release the document to national and 
international media.

<F P=106> [Speech by Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro </F>
to the opening session of the 10th legislature at the National 
Assembly in Managua -- live] 
  [Text] Mr. President of the National Assembly, Messrs. 
members of the Board of Directors and representatives of the 
National Assembly, Messrs. members of the branches of 
government, Messrs. cabinet members, Messrs. members of the 
diplomatic corps, special guests, Nicaraguans: 
  In addressing this new legislature today, 10 January 1994, I 
wish to submit this annual report to the nation by officially 
closing the first three years of my constitutional mandate and 
opening the doors to the last three years -- the second half of 
this democratic government, which the Nicaraguan people decided 
should be headed by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. 
  In the past three years we have worked to overcome the harsh 
reality I found on 25 February 1990, represented by a destroyed 
and defeated Nicaragua; with dead people who should never have 
died in war; with mutilated victims who should never have 
suffered their misfortune; and with a bombed, sabotaged, and 
simply abandoned infrastructure with an economy greatly weakened 
by hyperinflation. 
  We are ending a three-year period which had a very difficult 
starting point, very different from what I, as president, would 
have liked to find. It was a reality I could never have 
imagined, but I decided to face it with a deep sense of historic 
and patriotic responsibility to save my people from greater 
suffering. We believed that only with peace and hard work would 
we be able to overcome whole decades of deterioration. 
  We are ending three years dedicated to putting the house in 
order, to clean, and to prepare the land that was full of 
resentment and hatred and damage caused by physical destruction 
and economic distortions. They have been three years dedicated 
to sowing the seeds of reconciliation, dialogue, and concerted 
efforts. We have been sowing the seeds of a healthy economy, 
free of deceit and illusions. We have been sowing the seeds of 
public freedoms and political pluralism. We have spent three 
years taking care of the seedling, preventing it from being 
destroyed by the numerous enemies who are afraid of anything 
that smells like life itself and the future. 
  We are ending a tough period which in the past year brought 
us serious difficulties with a poor harvest adversely affected 
by a severe rainy season and disadvantageous price conditions 
for our coffee. We also had to deal with rearmed groups from 
both sides which resisted joining civilian life and who attacked 
us with kidnappings in the countryside and the city. We had to 
face attacks in important cities that left death, pain, and 
losses. Nicaraguans who love peace and freedom do not share 
these actions. 
  That is why I think 1993 tested our democratic commitment 
and 
our determination to build a new Nicaragua. Despite great 
difficulties, we promoted the country's reactivation of 
solidarity, which I initiated last 10 January, when with great 
confidence and trust I invited you -- honorable representatives, 
your political parties, associations, labor unions, churches, 
and everyone -- to promote economic growth in favor of the poor. 
In 1993, we sowed the country's reactivation. This will allow 
us to harvest an economic growth of approximately 4 percent in 
1994, based on an encouraging growth of 20 percent in 
agriculture activities and 10 percent in fishing activities. 
  Although it is true that there is a lot to be done, we 
should be happy to have attained the best rice, bean, corn, 
soybean, and peanut harvests in the history of our country. We 
also had a coffee harvest that surpassed 1 million quintals 
which is the basis to guarantee that the reactivation of coffee 
in Nicaragua has no way back. 
  In 1993, we sowed solidarity with new social programs to 
support the unemployed in the rural and urban sectors. More 
children attended school and more youths went to training 
centers. In 1994, this will allow for the harvesting of greater 
stability and greater community participation in the solution of 
the grave problems we still have to face. 
  In 1993, we also promoted the dialogue like in no other year 
of my government. It was basically promoted among the political 
parties. 
  We made substantial progress in the solution of property 
problems by issuing land titles and making compensation 
payments. We hope that these specific steps will allow us to 
harvest greater tolerance, greater consensus, and greater 
commitment from all with democracy and the de jure system in 
1994. 
  In addition to working for reactivation, solidarity, and 
dialogue in 1993, we also worked to end, once and for all, the 
political opportunities and moral pretexts of the armed groups 
that insisted on their mistaken attitude. We reached our goal 
based on a just combination of forgiveness and amnesty with the 
firmness of the Public Force. 
  Thus, 1993 has been representative of the first half of my 
presidential mandate: a period of sowing, working, sacrifice, 
and struggling so that in the second half -- without ever 
thinking that we can rest -- we can begin reaping the fruits of 
the patient sowing season, a time of heroic sacrifices. 
  Today, we begin the next three years of my government 
convinced that we will devote our time to reaping the fruits of 
the great effort we have been making. It is an effort that was 
shared by all, an effort that will continue in the future 
because we are certain that we sowed peace, democracy, and 
development. No one can prevent us from legitimately enjoying 
our daily work. 
  In 1994, we will increase economic growth by sowing the land 
to guarantee a GNP for 1995. We will increase economic growth 
by using better our resources from the sea and promoting the 
fishing industry to increase its production. We will increase 
economic growth by reactivating the construction, mining, and 
tourism sectors to create more jobs and promote economic 
activity, as well as to create greater confidence in our common 
future. 
  In 1994, we will increase credit volumes for production by 
31 
percent. More importantly, we will guarantee that this 
financing will reach the hands of 25,000 new clients to increase 
the number of beneficiaries by 47 percent compared to the 1993 
figure. 
  To do this, we will have special credits for coffee renewal, 
cattle breeding and development, tourism, and industrial 
reconversion, as well as unconventional credit programs for 
small producers in the rural and urban sectors. This will be 
done through an expansion in the Program To Support the 
Micro-Enterprise, PANIC [Progama de Apoyo a la Micro-Empresa]. 
With this program, we will create and strengthen managerial and 
technical programs for unconventional credit institutions to 
promote good policies to channel financial resources and 
guarantee the democratization of credit, thus allowing small 
rural and urban businessmen to gain access to it. 
  With PANIC, we will also promote the implementation of 
specific projects and programs to support the microenterprise in 
an effort to increase their productivity and competitiveness. 
Thus, we will also increase the revenues of small producers in 
rural and urban areas. 
  Along with the loans, we will promote public investment, 
which is a product of the fiscal adjustment efforts we have been 
carrying out since I took office. Thanks to international 
cooperation, we are now able to provide the public investment 
plan with more funds, which will mean a 40 percent increase over 
last year; this will allow us to create more jobs for the 
unemployed. 
  As part of this program and as a result of the reactivation 
of the Housing Bank, we are beginning an ambitious program to 
build housing throughout the country. This program will begin 
to yield results this year by meeting the housing needs of large 
sectors of our society. In 1994 we hope to build some 7,000 
homes in 26 cities throughout the country. A large number of 
private construction companies will participate in this project, 
which will in turn generate many new jobs in all 26 cities. 
  In 1994 we will also continue working to resolve the land 
ownership problem. We will issue property deeds for 203,000 
manzanas that will benefit 9,000 household, who already have 
their plots but are waiting for the legal papers. These 203,000 
manzanas added to the 140,000 manzanas whose deeds my government 
has already issued draw us closer to the set goal. Through the 
next three years we should conclude issuing deeds for 1 million 
manzanas, which will benefit our farmers. 
  In addition to issuing deeds for agricultural plots, we will 
continue working in the urban sector by issuing approximately 
25,000 new OOT [Office for the Territorial Organization] 
solutions to the legal owners of urban lots acknowledged by Law 
No. 86. These 25,000 solutions, added to the 26,000 [word 
indistinct] already issued, will draw us closer to the 90,000 
requests received. I expect to meet this goal by 1995. Next year 
we will begin issuing the land deeds for these lots; the 
families that will benefit deserve this. 
  We will also make progress this year with the review of 
4,200 
homes that were acquired through Law No. 85. This year we want 
to solve the 10,200 [property ownership] cases pending. Of 
these cases, 6,000 have been reviewed and 4,300 requests have 
been approved -- in principle -- in favor of the legitimate 
beneficiaries. [figures as heard] 
  Parallel to the issuance of agrarian titles and solvencies 
to new land and house owners, my government will step up the 
compensation process by issuing bonds to all those whose 
properties were unfairly confiscated in the last decade and who 
were not able to get their properties back -- for any of the 
reasons stipulated in the government program. 
  The bond compensation system has been in effect 10 months 
and 
it has proved that, aside from receiving the international 
community's recognition, it is an efficient means to restore 
patrimonial losses. Bonds amounting to 630 million cordobas have 
been issued and accepted as settlement to numerous applications 
for compensation and more than 150 million cordobas in 
transactions have been carried out. This represents 24 percent 
of the issued bonds. These bonds have been used to purchase 
assets owned by the state -- including enterprises, farms, 
shares, commercial modules, land, and industrial and farm 
equipment and spare parts. 
  We will continue to issue bonds in 1994. These bonds will 
continue to receive strong and solid support with the offer of 
state-owned assets and real estate that may be purchased with 
bonds. Bonds may also be used to pay debts owed to state banks 
and to purchase 40 percent of the telephone company's shares. 
This sale will allow us to gather at an earlier date -- through 
weekly public auctions -- certificates whose owners wish to 
voluntarily negotiate them in exchange for cash. 
  I wish to reassert today that my government is firmly 
determined to guarantee an offer of assets, as well as 
mechanisms to use the bonds, in 1994. This will allow the 
reinstatement of their true financial value. We will manage to 
repair -- in a better way -- the patrimonial damage sustained by 
people whose properties have been confiscated in the measure 
that they manage to wait for the best opportunity to convert 
their bonds. 
  Credits will be used to support production activities, 
public 
investment programs, and solutions to the land ownership 
problem. Two more contributions will be made for training 
programs and the transfer of agricultural technology to small 
producers of basic grains, and to repair the first 180 km of 
roads in production areas, within the REMACAR [expansion 
unknown] Program. The former will be handled by the new 
Institute of Agrarian and Livestock Technology [Insta], which 
begins its work in January with more than 600 technicians and 
workers; and the latter, the roads, will be handled by the 
Ministry of Construction and Transportation, which shall repair 
a total of 700 km during the second phase of my term, within 
this same program. 
  Credit and production, public investment and employment, 
issuance of land titles and compensation, training and road 
repairs -- all these are factors that should allow us to 
strengthen peace, democracy, and development in 1994. 
  We have the [words indistinct] confirm the existence of a 
new 
geothermal source in our country -- in the Malpaisillo zone. 
This brings us great hope for the nation's geothermal 
development and the beginning of a major tourism activity in 
Montelimar and certain zones of Granada, Masaya, Carazo, Rivas, 
and Rio San Juan. This will offer numerous opportunities to the 
Nicaraguan economy. 
  Nonetheless, my commitment does not end with the (?gold) of 
recovery. It is in solidarity with the poorest, the unemployed, 
and those affected by natural phenomena. In 1993 the 
implementation of a community participation (?structure) yielded 
97 development committees in an equal number of municipalities 
so that these groups could present the social needs of their 
communities to the presidency of the Republic in an orderly 
fashion. In this manner, I complied with what I spoke about one 
year ago in this same hall when I said that participation with 
solidarity would be one of the most important social policy 
bases. 
  In 1994 we are going to strengthen the participation of the 
citizens even more, particularly in the rural areas, so that 
those who receive the benefits are the ones who will exercise 
their social [word indistinct] and will watch over the 
development and maintenance of the social works that this 
government has launched. 
  With regard to employment, it is important to mention that 
in 
1994 we will use the established bases for working jointly with 
the municipal mayoralties in a series of programs that, in 
addition to increasing employment, will allow the continuity of 
specific works for the benefit of community development. Mayors 
throughout the country with various political ideas can attest 
to the (?initial) answers my government gave in 1993 to the 
unemployment situations in their towns. We did not solve all of 
them, but we have prepared the basis for a methodology that in 
1994 will duplicate the results for the benefit of more 
unemployed people, providing temporary employment to some 24,000 
persons each month throughout the nation through the Social 
Action Ministry. In addition, the Basic Grains Bank will be 
expanded and improved in 1994, and it will become more efficient 
so that the farmers who do not have access to formal credit will 
receive benefits in this alternate system that supports 
production. 
  We will also continue with the Emergency Fund for Social 
Investments, FISE -- strengthened with new donations and 
financing -- which will redouble its work for rehabilitating 
social infrastructures and provide employment in the 1,000 
projects we will implement this year in the 143 municipalities 
of the country. 
  As president, I am convinced that the most important thing 
now is to increase production and ensure that the private sector 
becomes the motor for our country's development. Nonetheless, I 
want to point out that -- as a member of private enterprise -- I 
also understand the small coffee producers of La Dahlia, the 
small corn producers of Matiguas, and the man who owns a small 
workshop or produces our beautiful national crafts. For me, all 
of them are members of private enterprise. 
  In 1994 we will emphasize support for the small producer so 
that he will play a more dynamic role in the economic 
development of the country, in the same manner as large 
producers. We will provide support to the small producer 
through the financing that has been approved for this human 
network of organizations, cooperatives, nongovernmental 
organizations, [word indistinct] circles, poles of development, 
and other forms of associations that we have managed to organize 
in the last two years. 
  The foundations have already been established. The year 
1994 will be the year we will begin to enjoy the results of this 
initiative. During the past few months I had the opportunity to 
meet and talk with numerous owners of small farms, cooperative 
members, mothers' associations [asociaciones de madres], 
development committees, doctors, nurses, teachers, and other 
professionals. We inaugurated numerous projects, especially 
schools and health centers. All these contacts gave me an 
opportunity to learn what the Nicaraguan people really want. 
They genuinely want [word indistinct] and work. Before, they 
wanted peace and reconciliation. 
  From as distant a place as Isla de Ometepe to Rio Blanco, 
from the community of Cardenas to [word indistinct], from the 
city of Juigalpa to Jinotega, from Brooklyn to Chinandega the 
message was always the same: Mrs. Chamorro, we are now at 
peace, now we need to produce. In listening to these simple 
words from a population that does not have access to the media, 
cannot voice its concern in the newspapers, and whose faces do 
not appear on television newscasts, I have given instructions 
for 1994 to be a year of cooperation for production. In this 
respect we will jointly be able to cut the level of unemployment 
and advance in a parallel direction along with the economic 
take-off toward progress with less poverty. 
  As to education, we plan to continue increasing the number 
of 
schools twice as fast as the growth rate in the student 
population. During 1994, the student population is expected to 
increase by 3 percent, but we expect to increase the number of 
schools by 6 percent. This means that the 1,000,070 students 
registered during 1993 will increase by 63,000 students. The 
student population is expected to total 1.123 million during 
1994. Nevertheless, we are not satisfied with merely increasing 
student registration, we are also seeking to cut the drop-out 
rate. That is why we will continue to pay special attention to 
the primary grades and give them preferential attention as well 
as maintain the glass of milk program. We also plan to 
implement teacher improvement programs. In addition, we will 
continue to promote education decentralization in order to 
ensure that the state will efficiently continue its role of 
regulating national education, and for the communities, parents, 
and teachers to directly participate in the performance and 
management of their respective educational centers. Through this 
we expect to encourage full participative democracy and honor 
Article 118 of the current political Constitution which calls 
for wide-ranging community participation in the education 
process. 
  In the health sector, I must say that following the [words 
indistinct] the government program, an improvement in medical 
attention to those insured. Today, I can say to all Nicaraguan 
workers that the health and medical program which they have been 
expecting for the past 15 years has finally become a reality. 
The new social security model went into effect at the end of 
the past year through duly authorized provisional medical 
centers already operating in Granada, Masaya, and Managua. We 
expect to extend this type of medical facility throughout the 
country. This new form of medical attention for workers, which 
the state and the private sector initiative are jointly 
operating, is the formula we have developed which allows us to 
work and solve the just and simple needs of a population that 
contributes and makes payments to the Nicaraguan social security 
system. In order for it to improve, be objective, and grow with 
[words indistinct], it must be combined with environmental 
protection programs, as well as the defense of our national 
patrimony. 
  From the beginning of my administration, I placed special 
emphasis on conserving and managing the environment like no 
other president had ever attempted in the history of our 
country. In spite of the difficult social and economic 
challenges we face, we have been analyzing and approving plans 
aimed at strengthening viable development and rational 
utilization of natural resources and at protecting the 
environment. 
  I have been backed by the municipal governments, peasants, 
producers, environmental protection organizations, ecologists, 
and the people, and during the past three years of democratic 
work we have created environmental awareness at an unprecedented 
level in Nicaragua. 
  Many friendly governments have contributed to this effort 
and 
specialized international agencies have unselfishly given us 
technical assistance and financial support to promote many 
ecological development proejcts. The same is true for the 
United Nations. We attended the Earth Summit in Brazil to 
reaffirm our vocation for peace between man and nature. We are 
in favor of conciliating production needs and environmental 
protection. 
  Now, as a specific manifestation of my political will to 
back 
suitable efforts in favor of the environment, we are 
transforming the Environment and Natural Resources Institute, 
which this year will celebrate its 15th anniversary, into the 
Environment and Natural Resources Ministry. 
  I trust that with the cooperation of all Nicaraguans we will 
be able to responsibly set in motion, with our eyes on the 
future, a strategy capable of transforming Nicaragua into an 
ecologically ordered, environmentally clean, and economically 
prosperous country. 
  I hope that what we are starting now will help the entire 
nation and last forever. 
  All the plans in favor of production, social solidarity, and 
environmental protection are not enough. Justice and strength 
must go hand in hand with these plans. Corruption, smuggling, 
tax evasion, jewelry thieves, armed bands, and criminals must be 
persecuted. 
  The work of the police and the Army has been very important 
in recent times to guarantee the citizens' security, especially 
in the countryside. Security has been threatened by armed bands 
that unfortunately still exist. Our authorities will always 
vigorously fight these bands, which are engaged in pillaging, 
attacks, kidnappings, and interrupting harvests. Many policemen 
and Army officers and soldiers have died in this struggle to 
return peace and security to the people who live in the 
Nicaraguan countryside. 
  Today I want to posthumously acknowledge those who have died 
in defense of the law and the Constitution and to fully back the 
police and the Army in their pacification endeavor. This year 
we will strengthen the Army with a new organic law that should 
bolster its professionalization process, depoliticize the 
process for electing its officials, and offer guarantees to the 
men and women who, with an exalted sense of fatherland, dedicate 
their lives to serving the nation. 
  Force must remain under the influence of justice and this is 
why we are going to work as much as we can for a new Supreme 
Court of Justice that should begin functioning this year and 
increase the level of respect for the law throughout the 
national territory. 
  The appointment of new officials at the Attorney General's 
Office, as well as the fact that this week we will send a list 
of distinguished professionals to the National Assembly from 
which a new comptroller general of the Republic will be chosen, 
should be seen as a renewed effort by my government to guarantee 
stability, bolster the establishment of a state of law, and 
consolidate the full enjoyment of public liberties in our 
country -- ideals that have motivated my actions as president 
since 1990. 
  During these years, my government has tirelessly sought to 
achieve national stability and harmony between the different 
political and social forces so that together we can work for the 
common well-being, the strengthening of democracy, the 
termination of the last remains of the war, and the best 
solutions to overcome the economic crisis. 
  I have always been aware of the fact that without stability 
there is no prospect for economic growth. It is not easy to 
govern a country that is still dominated by the sequels of war 
and political confrontation. However, agreements have been 
reached thanks to good will. 
  Today, before you, I wish to praise the patriotic efforts 
that have produced recent agreements to grant stability to the 
operation of this National Assembly and bring stability to 
Nicaragua as well. I wish to offer my personal recognition to 
all the honorable representatives of the National Assembly who 
are here today, and to those who have already stated their 
willingness to undertake their parliamentary tasks later, in 
order to responsibly assume the popular mandate they received on 
25 February 1990. 
  I am not referring to the voices of those who continue to 
insist on confrontation from outside this National Assembly, but 
to those who, like you, have made an effort to end the 
irrational polarization. 
  Today we will introduce changes to the composition of the 
Board of Directors [of the National Assembly], as I have been 
told, and this fills me with joy because this deed conveys a 
clear will for understanding. I salute this will and applaud it 
along with the people of Nicaragua. Therefore, I must give 
special recognition to Dr. Gustavo Tablada Zelaya for his 
meritorious work as president of the Legislative corps and for 
his detached and patriotic contribution to the normalization of 
the National Assembly. 
  I also recognize the members of the four blocs that broke 
the 
political inertia and were able to reach these agreements for 
the well-being of Nicaragua. The people will know how to 
recognize these patriotic contributions to the national 
stability. My wish is that all the representatives to this 
National Assembly may fully integrate themselves with the tasks 
of the legislature that begins today and to give Nicaragua good 
laws, which is what Nicaragua needs. To remain outside has no 
sense or justification. 
  I also applaud the initiative aimed at introducing partial 
reforms to the Constitution. I will closely follow the 
discussion process, and my government, in line with mutual 
respect for the state governments' independence, will try to 
contribute with its own criteria to enrich the contents of the 
reforms. 
  My aspiration is that the constitutional reforms will be 
for the good of strengthening national stability and 
institutions, not to weaken or divide them, and so that 
democracy will move on a better course and so that democratic 
continuity will be guaranteed through honest and fair electoral 
processes. I want to state here that my government supports the 
changes in the Constitution through partial reforms. 
  Since the nation's main political forces have been debating 
diverse positions and mechanisms to reform or change the 
Constitution, I, as president of the Republic, must express my 
position on this issue in order to inform the Legislative 
Assembly and the community. The program that my government is 
obliged to fulfill has the following main objectives, among 
others: first, the establishment of a state of law, exercising 
full democracy and social justice; second, the reaching of a 
national consensus [words indistinct] to strengthen 
reconciliation among Nicaraguans and overcome the nation's 
overall crisis; third, the creation of a government that is 
essentially civilian, republican, democratic, and 
representative, based on the nation's unity. 
  Within those principles and within the framework of the 
political, economic, and social reality Nicaragua is 
experiencing, the government must unquestionably support all the 
corresponding Constitutional reforms and [words indistinct] in 
keeping with those objectives and these realities. These 
reforms should be conceived with patriotic goals in mind for the 
community and the nation's well-being, without taking into 
account party interests. These reforms should seek to create a 
wise and lasting Constitution that reflects the Nicaraguan 
people's true values, ideals, and feelings; it should not just 
respond to mere passing situations. We should seek a 
Constitution that is the result of a national consensus in which 
the people are given the opportunity to express their points of 
view as a significant contribution in a participant democracy. 
Therefore, these constitutional reforms should be serious, [word 
indistinct], and responsible. We cannot ignore the historical 
opportunity we are offered to draw up a frank and open 
Constitution through public dialogue. 
  In my opinion, the call to hold elections for a constituent 
assembly is not ideal or timely. To dissolve this Legislative 
Assembly as some wish means the interruption of the people's 
will at a high economic cost that the nation is not in a 
position to assume. Some also say that a constituent assembly 
must not only totally change the Constitution, it must also end, 
ahead of time, the presidential term. This type of criteria does 
not represent a willingness for peace but a willingness for 
confrontation. 
  The presidential term ends on 10 January 1997. It is my 
intention to hand over my office to whomever is freely elected 
in the presidential elections to be held in November 1996. 
Respect for the presidential term [words indistinct] 
presidential mandate as a result of free elections, is one of 
the great contributions that [word indistinct] must make for 
Nicaragua's democratization. 
  We start this year by promising it will be better than last 
year; there are good signs of an improving economy. To attempt 
to launch the people in a political campaign now is to take away 
their right to a break and improvement. The holding of 
elections for a constituent assembly would polarize the 
community once again, and it would open wounds that still have 
not been totally closed. It would hold back economic 
reactivation so longed for in these past three years that has 
had very high costs and meant big sacrifices. I propose to 
these parties or political groups still bent on this idea to 
give the people a political truce. Let us respect their right 
to a breather and to an opportunity to unite efforts for 
progress. 
  Instead of talking about elections, confrontations, and 
political struggles, let us talk about working; let us talk 
about production and order; let us talk about fighting 
unemployment and reconciling ourselves; let us talk about unity 
so that we can overcome the problems we are confronting. The 
Nicaraguan people are entitled to have their wishes respected, 
to be in a better situation. Violence, as well as the calls for 
violence, must cease once and for all. 
  I invite the Nicaraguan people -- men and women -- to work 
together for peace and stability, harmony, democracy, and 
progress in our families. We all have a place in this joint 
effort to build a new Nicaragua with our faith in God and with a 
spirit filled with reconciliation. Thank you, dear friends of 
the Legislative Assembly. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by Vilma Estrada for the "National News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Central Bank President Jose Evenor Taboada was 
categorical when he stated that transactions carried out by the 
government for the sale of gold are totally honest. 
  [Begin Taboada recording] That is a resource which belongs 
to the country and should be managed trusting... [pauses] guided 
by the best conditions in the market, where it should be sold 
when the market price indicates the gold should be sold -- and 
it should be withheld when the market price is so low that the 
advisable thing is to withhold the gold. The rest is lack of 
information on the part of those who have been critical. [end 
recording] 
  He emphasized how important it is for the country to sign 
the 
[word indistinct] agreement with the World Bank and the IMF. 
  [Begin Taboada recording] With regard to the IMF, we are 
talking about $84 million distributed over three years; in the 
World Bank's case, we are talking about approximately $140 
million over a shorter term -- but the amount must also be 
disbursed within a period that does not end in 1994. The 
signing of those agreements is very important because it means 
Nicaragua presents a certificate to the international community 
to prove that we are doing what is necessary to end our 
dependence on funds from abroad; that we are adopting the 
measures needed by the economy to eventually end dependence on 
international cooperation; that we are adopting the necessary 
measures to effectively activate the country's economic 
development; and, in sum, that the handling of public finances 
and various policies is adequate and will allow the country to 
achieve its full reactivation in the medium term. [end recording] 
  A delegation is scheduled to arrive in the country in late 
January, possibly to sign the agreement. 
  [Begin Taboada recording] It is important to clearly 
understand that Nicaragua needs this agreement. I believe that 
anyone who thinks it possible to continue a stable economic 
policy without those agreements is being unrealistic. 
Therefore, all Nicaraguan groups should join forces to achieve 
the best settlement possible within the normal parameters of 
these negotiations, in which the two parties concede certain 
things for the sake of achieving the best settlement possible. 
[end recording] 
  He announced that $30 million will arrive in the country 
from 
Taiwan not later than early February. There will also be aid 
from the United States -- approximately $40 million.

  [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 10 Jan, CANA -- The umbrella 
Guyana Trades Union Congress (TUC) has rescheuled to Thursday 
[13 January] a march and rally to protest low wages and 
increases in electricity charges. The group, which has been 
pressing the government for increased public sector wages beyond 
a 20 percent increase awarded last year, announced the new date 
after heavy rains washed out plans for the protest last Friday. 
  TUC, in collaboration with the Guyana Consumers Association, 
has also led opposition to increased electricity charges, 
including a planned 400 Guyana dollars (one Guyana dollar = 
approx. 0.78 U.S. cents) minimum charge which has since been 
scrapped by the power company. 
  The Guyana Electricity Corporation (GEC) has, however, gone 
ahead with a 25-percent hike in electricity rates as of January, 
and a further 25-percent hike is proposed from July. 
  Thursday's rally at the John Ford Car Park in central 
Georgetown will be addressed by TUC president Lincoln Lewis, 
Public Service Union (PSU) general secretary Susan Moore, and 
National Association of Agricultural, Commercial, and Industrial 
Employees (NAACIE) advisor N.K. Gopaul.

  [Text] Quito, 7 Jan (EFE) -- It was officially announced 
today that Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen has changed 
his ministers of education, social welfare, and industry and 
commerce and integration, as well as other ranking state 
officials. 
  Outgoing Social Welfare Minister Monserrat Butina, accused 
of 
nepotism by the opposition, will be replaced by Deputy Alberto 
Cardenas, a member of the ruling Republican Unity Party. 
  Education Minister Eduardo Pena, who at the end of 1993 had 
to deal with a two-month long strike by approximately 100,000 
teachers and professors who work for the state, will be replaced 
by the Education Ministry's Assistant Culture Secretary Rosalia 
Arteaga. 
  Industry, Commerce, and Integration Minister Jorge Garcia, 
who recently criticized several government policies, will be 
replaced by Jose Vicente Maldonado, who until today held the 
post of secretary general of the administration. 
  Maldonado will be replaced by his former assistant secretary 
Carlos Larreategui. 
  Cardenas and Maldonado are the third individuals appointed 
to 
the Ministries of Social Welfare and Industry, Commerce and 
Integration, respectively, by Duran-Ballen during his first 18 
months in office. 
  The president also appointed economist Marcel Laniado de 
Wind 
as executive director of the National Council of State 
Modernization. 
  The announced changes, expected since December, are the 
result of specific situations faced by the outgoing ministers 
and not general political changes within the government. 
  Most of the new officials will take the oath today during a 
ceremony that will be presided over by Duran-Ballen at 
Carondelet Palace, the presidential headquarters. The rest will 
be sworn in within the next few days.

  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari met a few 
minutes ago with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani and 
Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas. This meeting had 
been agreed upon in early December 1993. 
  The meeting, which lasted a couple of hours, was held at the 
official residence of Los Pinos in an atmosphere of cordiality 
and frankness. They reviewed the regional situation, bilateral 
relations, the outlook for the free trade agreement, and various 
topics of interest to the three countries, as is explained in a 
communique issued a few minutes ago by the Presidency General 
Media Directorate. The governments expressed their desire to 
cooperate and to provide mutual support to achieve greater 
development in the region. 
  The Salvadoran and Honduran presidents will return to their 
countries today. The communique does not specify whether the 
presidents discussed the topic of Chiapas.

<F P=106> [Speech by Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro </F>
during a swearing-in ceremony for the new cabinet at the 
Presidency in Managua -- live] 
  [Text] Nicaraguan people, members of the cabinet: This 10 
January 1994 marks the beginning of the second half of my 
presidential period. We must be convinced that, beginning 
today, we will harvest the fruits of the great efforts made by 
the people and the government in these past few years to secure 
peace, democracy, and development. 
  In the beginning of this second half of my presidential 
period, we have more opportunities for economic growth, a 
considerable development of social programs, and a better 
outlook for a greater political, social, and economic stability. 
  Along our Atlantic coast, the electoral process of the 
autonomous regions of the northern and southern Atlantic areas 
-- with the participation of the various political parties, 
alliances, and popular groups -- must be institutionalized. 
Popular elections in our country are periodic and sacred. In 
the past, the change of authorities was made through force and 
violence. Now, we do this in complete freedom with joy and a 
great civic spirit. 
  With enthusiasm and renewed optimism, I just announced the 
cabinet members that will accompany me in 1994 -- a year whose 
task will be to reach the noble goals established for 1994. 
Only in unity, with much perseverance and true teamwork, we 
will be able to bequeath our citizens a more prosperous 
Nicaragua and a renewed and stronger state apparatus. It will 
be a state apparatus that will help strengthen our government 
institutions. 
  Public work in Nicaragua has been misunderstood at times and 
constantly criticized. Many criticize it for political reasons, 
while others criticize it out of ignorance, because they do not 
know how difficult it is to build that which has been destroyed 
and to make progress amid so many obstacles. Many times, we 
have had to make difficult decisions, decisions that are 
unpopular. Nevertheless, we must remember that it is not easy to 
govern. We are always subject to criticism -- even criticism 
that is ill-intentioned. Still, if we want to be honest and 
consistent rulers, we have to assume our commitment seriously. 
Presidential decisions should not be made based on political 
costs but, rather, based on assumed responsibilities. The 
important thing is to be sincere with the people, always keeping 
their legitimate interests in mind. 
  Public work, in addition to involving great sacrifices, must 
be characterized by honesty, integrity, a devotion to duty, and 
a love for our people, particularly the neediest sectors. To 
govern is to serve and fulfill the assigned duty responsibly and 
patriotically. 
  Let us make our daily work effective and develop our efforts 
inspired on national interests only in order that social justice 
and reconciliation will become a reality for us. They will be 
the expression of a government that is based on unity, concerted 
effort, and dialogue. 
  For this reason, government offices must be open so that all 
Nicaraguan citizens, regardless of their social or political 
status, can enter them and be heard respectfully and patiently. 
For this reason, we must also be willing to implement the 
postulates of the government program, a program Nicaraguans 
voted for on 25 February 1990. 
  I want to sincerely thank all Nicaraguans who accompanied me 
last year in government posts and who are leaving public office. 
I also thank the people who will continue to accompany me in 
the government this year. 
  I am certain we are going to work in a coordinated fashion 
and with true patriotic devotion. I hope that God enlightens us 
and makes us more efficient in our posts to enable us to better 
serve the Nicaraguan people. Thank you, my dear friends and 
cabinet members, and may God bless you all. [applause]

  [Editorial Report] HOUSING STATISTICS--The Bolivian 
Government has promised to build 17,500 houses by August 1994 to 
reach the goal established by the Ministry of Human 
Development's plan. The project will be financed by 
international organizaitons including the Inter-American 
Development Bank which is negotiating $45 million in credits for 
this purpose. The money is to be administered by the National 
Housing Fund (FONVI). [Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS 7 Nov] 
  The nation's need for more adequate housing was documented 
in 
the 1992 National Population and Housing Census which revealed 
that 50 percent of heads of households did not own their own 
homes and that the number of homeowners has only increased 3 
percent in the past 16 years. During this period, the number of 
houses doubled in urban areas but rose only 18 percent in rural 
areas, suggesting increased migration to the cities. The 
country's main urban centers- -La Paz, Santa Cruz, Cochabamba, 
Potosi, and Oruro--contain 89 percent of urban housing. 
  According to official data there are 1,692,567 single family 
dwellings in the country and 8,575 collective dwelling units 
(hospitals, jails, barracks, hotels, convents, etc.). Other 
figures reveal that 41 percent of Bolivian single family 
dwellings are overcrowded with rooms shared by three or more 
people. The situation is exacerbated in urban areas especially 
in the eastern departments of Beni, Santa Cruz, and Pando. 
Besides overcrowding, 46 percent of Bolivian households lack 
access to potable water, 57 percent do not have basic sanitary 
services, and 45 percent do not have electricity. Most of the 
households that lack access to potable water are in Pando, Beni, 
Potosi, and Chuquisaca Departments. [La Paz PRESENCIA 13, 14 
Nov] 
  EDUCATION REFORM, STATISTICS--Vice President Victor Hugo 
Cardenas announced that the educational reform plan will be 
launched in 1994 with initial financing of $150 million from the 
Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. Dr. Enrique 
Ipina, undersecretary for education and culture in the Ministry 
of Human Development, highlighted the main points of the plan 
which is being elaborated by the Technical Support Team for 
Educational Reform (ETARE). ETARE compiled the following 
literacy and educational statistics to justify the need for this 
comprehensive reform "unique to Latin America." 

  -  20 percent of Bolivians have never attended school and are 
totally illiterate. 
  -  30 percent of adults are functionally 
illiterate. 
  -  68 percent of illiterate Bolivians are women. 
  -  70 
percent of illiterate Bolivians live in the countryside. 
  -  60 
percent of rural children enroll in school. Of this figure, 70 
percent never make it past the first year, with only 1.4 percent 
of male children and 0.7 percent of female children finishing 
secondary school. 
  -  87 percent of urban children attend school. Of 
this number, 31 percent finish primary school. 
  -  26 percent of 
urban female children who entered primary school finish 
secondary school. 

    There are 67,555 teachers in Bolivia. Of these, 40,786 (60 
percent) are in the cities, and 26,769 (40 percent) are in the 
countryside. 

  -  59 percent of teachers (40,409) teach primary school. 
  -  15.4 
percent (10,426) teach secondary school. 
  -  20.3 percent (13,781) 
are intermediate school teachers. 
  -  4.3 percent (2,939) teach 
preschool or kindergarten. 

    The teacher-student ratio is 1:18. However, since most 
teachers are in the cities, there are rural and indigenous 
communities without a single teacher. Furthermore, a little over 
half of the rural schools offer only the first three years of 
primary school. Rural children, therefore, have difficulty 
finishing even primary school. [Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS FACETAS 
Supplement] 
  According to ETARE, in the last 10 years university 
enrollment has increased at 7.2 percent per year but only 4.5 
percent of those enrolled in a university manage to graduate, 
and the dropout rate is 15 percent. Other figures reveal that 
approximately 40,000 secondary school graduates intend to enroll 
in the country's 23 public and private universities (this year). 
[La Paz EL DIARIO 10 Nov; PRESENCIA 22 Nov] 
  Under Secretary Ipina outlined some of the goals of the 
first 
four years of the educational reform plan (1994-97) which aims 
at "transforming the educational system by 100 percent:" 

  -  7,200 new schools and school councils. 
  -  1,200 nuclear 
schools and councils. 
  -  100 new school districts and nine 
departmental directorates. 
  -  50,000 primary school teachers, 500 
supervisors, and 720 specialists. 
  -  1 million children in school: 
600,000 in urban areas and 400,000 in rural areas. 
  [La Paz PRESENCIA DEL PAIS 4 Dec] 
  CHUOUISACA: RURAL POVERTY, LAND OWNERSHIP--Walter Valda 
Rivera, director of a Jesuit organization active among the 
farmers of Tarija, Chuquisaca, and Potosi, and president of the 
association of nongovernmental organizations in the area, 
concluded that rural poverty in Chuquisaca Department has been 
increasing for the past eight years to the point that most rural 
families in the area "live on the edge of total misery" and that 
the "quality of life" index is the lowest in the country. In a 
seminar held by various nongovernmental organizations, he 
presented a paper analyzing land ownership and production: 

  -  While 300,000 hectares are arable, small farmers cultivate 
only 149,000 hectares, producing 285,000 metric tons. 
  -  Large 
landholdings or "latifundios" cover 80 percent of the land, with 
355 families owning 666,000 hectares, but most of this land lies 
fallow. 
  -  Small landholdings or "minifundios" are on the increase, 
with 60,000 families barely getting by with five hectares or 
less. 
  -  Internal migration has increased from 5,276 in 1980 to 
30,000 farmers leaving the department for La Paz, Sucre, or the 
interior. 
  -  Illiteracy in many of Chuquisaca's provinces is 80 
percent. 

    Valda blamed the "neoliberal" model for the increasing 
poverty because it is "incompatible with" the farmers' "communal 
lifestyle" and "fosters competitiveness, individualism, and 
selfishness." [La Paz PRESENCIA 30 Nov]

  [Text] San Jose, 10 Jan (DPA) -- Costa Rica, the world's 
second largest banana-producing country, will not participate in 
a meeting tomorrow in Brussels summoned by the European Union 
(EU) to discuss with Latin American banana-exporting countries, 
members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 
the controversy surrounding regional banana purchases. This is 
how Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas responded today when he 
said that "we already know Europe's position." 
  The meeting was summoned by the EU Executive Commission 
Agriculture Directorate to try to reach an agreement in the 
commercial dispute, which originated with restrictions on Latin 
American banana purchases, effective since July. 
  Latin American countries will meet in San Jose on 13 January 
to try and reach a consensus regarding an EU offer to assign 
quotas to each producing country and 70 percent of the import 
licenses. Most Latin American banana countries object to this 
European initiative. 
  "There is no need for a meeting with the EU, because Costa 
Rica already knows what it will be told," Rojas stated through a 
spokesman. 
  Costa Rica, together with Colombia, has begun negotiations 
regarding the EU initiative and has represented Latin American 
interests before GATT, which was lodged with a lawsuit nearly a 
year ago.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rican economic developments monitored through 
11 January; source follows in parentheses after each item. 
  Economy Minister Roberto Rojas confirmed on 4 January that 
the 1993 inflation rate was 9.05 percent, almost 7-percent lower 
than in 1992 and the lowest in the past 10 years. December 
inflation was .9 percent. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1623 GMT 4 Jan 
94) 
  The Center for the Promotion of Exports and Investments has 
reported that exports of products and services increased 52 
percent during the past three years. Exports in 1990 totaled 
$1.7 billion, and increased to 2.6 billion in 1993. Meanwhile, 
the Central Bank has reported that imports in 1990 totaled $1.9 
billion and are expected to reach approximately $3 billion in 
1993, an increase of $1 billion, or 50.9 percent during the past 
three years. (San Jose LA NACION in Spanish 28 Dec 93 p 21A) 
  Central Bank President Jorge Corrales has officially 
reported 
that 1993 closed with net international reserves totaling $945 
million, more than $20 million above the goal established by the 
IMF. Corrales has said revenues were obtained through exports, 
which grew 17 percent, tourism, which increased 20 percent, and 
foreign investments. 
  He said that Costa Rica has complied with another IMF 
requirement by reducing net credits in the public sector by 
almost 30 percent. According to Corrales, the accumulated 
inflation rate in 1993 was reduced to 9.05 percent, the lowest 
since 1978. To a large extent, this was due to controls on the 
fiscal deficit, which is estimated at 1.3 percent of the gross 
natinal product, and a reduction in import restrictions that 
began in 1992, Corrales explained. He added that factors that 
contributed to reduce the inflation rate were the reduction in 
the price of fuel and lower electricity and water rates. The 
government maintains that the current level of reserves will be 
sufficient to finance the deficit in the trade balance, which is 
estimated at $800 million, the highest in the country's history.

<F P=106> [News conference by Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani </F>
with local and international reporters and an unidentified 
moderator at the Polideportivo Center in San Salvador on 10 
January--live] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Moderator] Mario Jovel, from 
the "Up-to-Date" television newscast. 
  [Jovel] Good afternoon, Mr. President. Some small business 
owners and certain politicians have said that one of the 
repercussions of NAFTA could be Mexico's strong capabilities, 
which are very different than what Salvadorans have. Could this 
be a repercussion or what could be the main repercussions of 
NAFTA? 
  [Cristiani] I think that the repercussions, or the main 
repercussion, will generate competition. To that effect, our 
entrepreneurs will have to face the challenge of competing with 
products coming from other countries. Competition leads to 
better quality at a better price, and consumers, who are the 
majority of the population, receive the benefits; in other 
words, consumers will have greater options when choosing the 
product that provides better quality at the most reasonable 
price. 
  I think our entrepreneurs should not fear open competition. 
They have proven to be good businessmen on numerous occasions, 
and they have highly qualified workers. I think that if we make 
this decision--and I think entrepreneurs are about to make that 
decision--they will accept the challenge, and I think they will 
be successful. Personally, I do not think there is any reason 
why we should fear competition. We must obviously try harder to 
provide the people with those two elements. 
  There is always an advantage, even in free trade, and that 
is 
transportation. Transportation is what makes the difference 
between the imported and locally manufactured product; 
nevertheless, I still do not think there is anything to fear. 
Furthermore, the treaty with Mexico is asymmetrical; that is, 
our products will enter Mexico even before Mexican products 
enter El Salvador, according to what was agreed in Tuxtla 
Gutierrez; in other words, this is an additional advantage. 
  Naturally, if we want to see examples, let's see examples 
such as Mexico versus the United States, or let's see Spain 
versus Germany. Actually, there has been an increase in trade 
between the two countries, both in the cases of Spain and 
Germany. That is where each country has to seek in which areas 
it can be more competitive and then compete. 
  [Moderator] Carlos Marquez, from AFP. 
  [Marquez] Mr. President, the elections will be held in 68 
days, and I would like to know if any governments have been 
invited to observe the electoral process. 
  [Cristiani] That is something that corresponds to the 
Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal [TSE], and, as everyone knows, the United 
Nations will send observers. The United Nations is a world 
organization; therefore, all countries indirectly have the 
possibility of being included in a mission that we understand 
will arrive at the time of the elections. The mission will 
include 900 [as heard] observers. 
  For the time being, the TSE has only notified us that it has 
decided to invite all of the electoral bodies of Latin America 
inasmuch as they have an organization among themselves. They 
also have an agreement whereby all members of these bodies are 
observers in each other's elections. Apart from them, we have 
not had any other request by the TSE. 
  [Moderator] Amadeo Cabrera, LA NOTICIA. 
  [Cabrera] I would like to know if you will attend the new 
Honduran president's inaugural ceremonies, and how do you 
describe bilateral relations between the outgoing president and 
your government? 
  [Cristiani] Yes. We have plans to attend the inaugural 
ceremonies of the new Honduran Government on 27 January. I 
would say that relations between the government of President 
Callejas and ours have been excellent. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments in El Salvador monitored 
through 11 January 1994. Source is cited in parentheses 
following the item. 
  Finance Minister Edwin Sagrera stated that the most 
important 
fiscal events of 1993 were the reduction in the number of taxes 
and the increase in tax collection. Segrera explained that the 
fiscal reform reduced from 25 to three the number of taxes paid 
by Salvadorans. "Currently, there is only the value-added tax 
(VAT), the income tax, and the tax on imports which is paid at 
the Customs Office," he said. He stressed that "despite the 
reduction, tax collection increased thanks to a drop in tax 
evasion." He added that the fiscal deficit, which is 1.8 
percent of the gross national product and which amounts to 1.167 
billion colones, qualifies El Salvador to become a candidate for 
IMF credits. He emphasized that "the deficit can be handled 
indefinitely as long as it is adequately financed." (San 
Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 5 Jan 94 p 12)

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored by Panama 
Bureau through 11 January; source follows in parentheses after 
each item. 
  Social Investment Fund (FIS) sources have reported the FIS 
will receive over 270 million quetzals this year through 
contributions from government and international agencies. The 
sources have explained the FIS will receive 50 million quetzals 
from the government, 116 million quetzals from a World Bank 
loan, and 104 million quetzals from the German Development 
Agency. Foreign financing was made possible thanks to the 
executive passing of the regulation on FIS activities. 
(Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 5 Jan 94 p 65) 
  The National Statistics Institute (INE) has reported that 
inflation grew by 11.64 percent in 1993, the level expected by 
government authorities. Inflation grew by 1.31 percent and 1.22 
percent in November and December of 1993, respectively, 
representing a sudden increase in monthly inflation as compared 
to previous months. The government could not meet the objective 
of reducing inflation, which totaled 14.22 percent, by 8 points, 
in 1992. The INE has concluded that the increase in the cost of 
vegetables and fruits in December caused the hike in inflation. 
(Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1758 GMT 5 Jan 94) 
  The Central Bank of Guatemala has reported that as of 30 
September the public foreign debt totaled $2.1 billion. Of this 
amount, $1.5 billion corresponded to the public sector and 
$619.8 million to the Bank of Guatemala. This report cited a 
debt reduction of $124.6 million with respect to 1992, of which 
$85.7 million came from the Bank of Guatemala and $38.9 from the 
public sector. The foreign debt-gross domestic product 
relationship increased from 21.6 percent by the end of 1992 to 
18.7 percent in September of 1993. (Guatemala City EL GRAFICO 
in Spanish 6 Jan 94 p 62) 
  The National Cotton Council director has reported that 
cotton 
production in the country generated $13.9 million in revenues 
during 1993, a 1.7-percent increase with respect to 1992. 
According to cotton producers' estimates, national production 
will disappear in Guatemala within two years. The source 
concluded the decline in international cotton prices has 
continued, forcing several countries out of the market. (Mexico 
City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2357 GMT 6 Jan 94) 
  A study conducted by UNICEF's Social Planning Secretariat 
has 
revealed that 25 percent of the Guatemalan population is 
suffering from poverty. The document has reported that poverty 
is growing 5 percent annually. The study also highlighted the 
low social security coverage in urban areas, which is even worse 
in rural areas. UNICEF has concluded that some 77.6 percent of 
Guatemalan children suffer from some degree of malnutrition.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chilean Finance Minister-Designate Eduardo </F>
Aninat by Carolina Garcia de la Huerta; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Garcia] He was taken aback by his appointment. 
He had already pictured to himself that he and his family would 
travel to Washington, where he would be in charge of Chile's 
embassy in the United States. He had even practically finished 
packing his suitcases. 
  But fate and [President-elect] Eduardo Frei decided 
otherwise. He will be the successor to [Finance Minister 
Alejandro] Foxley, as well as to [Copper Corporation Executive 
President Designate Juan] Villarzu. 
  Eduardo Aninat, 45, is a Catholic University graduate in 
economics. He has a PhD in economics from Harvard University. 
He is well known in Chilean circles for his negotiating skills. 
President Aylwin entrusted him with the task of negotiating 
Chile's external debt in 1990. He is married to Teresita Sahli, 
and has six children. He has always been linked to the private 
sector and to economic affairs through his firm of management 
consultants -- Aninat, Mendez, and Merino -- which will have to 
lie dormant for several years. 
  At the president-elect's personal request he headed, until 
recently, a special commission, also including Fernando Leniz 
and Ramon Aboitiz, which was in charge of several aspects 
pertaining to the handing over of power. Aninat explains that 
the reason behind this is that the new administration wants to 
commence its period of office by working, and to that effect a 
seminar is to be held for the first time on the coming 13 March. 
It will be addressed especially to leading figures from foreign 
companies, who will have the chance to listen to presentations 
made by the new government's team. 
  This tall man, with a clear gaze and prematurely gray beard, 
speaks with great deliberation and in a reassuring tone. He 
keeps toying with a pencil while he speaks. Nothing seems to 
disturb him or, least of all, annoy him. He says that he does 
not have any obsessions, and has but one pet dislike: "I do not 
like people who bore you to tears by talking too much." Warm 
and unaffected, he is now getting ready to leave his office, 
located in one of the few houses left near El Bosque Street, 
which is at present lined with high-rise buildings. As of March 
he will occupy the best offices of the 12th floor at 120 
Teatinos Street, right in downtown Santiago and only a step from 
La Moneda -- precisely he who enjoys nature and ecology so much. 
He says that when he leaves the Finance Ministry he will return 
to Valdivia [where he has his ranch]. [passage omitted] 
  It seems that you are in the same situation Minister Foxley 
was in. When he was installed as finance minister he commented 
that it had fallen upon him to dance with the plain lady of the 
cabinet. Do you hold the same views now? 
  [Aninat] No... I believe I am going to dance with one of the 
gorgeous ladies, but the great challenge is to keep her 
beautiful and prevent others from handling her roughly. 
  [Garcia] Are you concerned about this? 
  [Aninat] I have one very clear thing in mind... I would 
rather lose my post as finance minister than put the stability 
that cost us so dear in jeopardy, not even for a single minute. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Garcia] You were associate coordinator for foreign policy 
of 
Frei's campaign management team... You accompanied him to his 
meetings with [Mexican President Carlos] Salinas de Gortari, 
prior to the signing of NAFTA. You have been adviser to 
[Argentine Economy Minister] Domingo Cavallo. After having been 
involved in foreign affairs for such a long time, were you 
disappointed with the fact that you were left without the 
embassy in Washington? 
  [Aninat] That was a very interesting challenge which we came 
to believe would become a reality. My wife Teresita and I were 
ready to take that challenge, and were little by little planning 
our lives to accommodate this new reality. We were to have left 
in April. And yet by an odd quirk, and by virtue of the post I 
am going to hold, I am not going to totally abandon this, 
because undoubtedly the free trade agreement with the United 
States must be handled by the Finance Ministry. Nevertheless, 
now you will have me as minister and not as ambassador. 
  [Garcia] NAFTA became at one time Foxely's great banner. 
Will you try to follow in Foxley's footsteps with regard to 
that issue? 
  [Aninat] No, I think that there are many issues, and the 
agenda ought to be more diversified, more flexible, more in 
keeping with modern times! -- he says, rapping with his index 
finger on the blue book on the table -- Frei's economic program. 
There will be other issues; not the ones Foxley had to deal 
with, but it goes without saying that NAFTA will be high on the 
list of priorities, even though it will be one among many. 
  [Garcia] And what are you going to do with all the work you 
have done, all the folders you prepared to take over as 
ambassador? 
  [Aninat] I am going to give them to my dear friend and 
fellow 
party member, [Foreign] Minister [-designate] Carlos Figueroa 
Serrano, next week. [passage omitted] 
  [Garcia] It has been said that there is a marked resemblance 
between you and Foxley, and that because of this one should 
expect "more of the same thing." Is that correct? 
  [Aninat] I would venture to say that we will now take 
strides 
while ensuring continuity, but there will also be a greater 
variety and complexity of issues. 
  [Garcia] Do you uphold your criticism of the economic team, 
namely that it lacked boldness in moving forward more quickly? 
  [Aninat] I do. I think that after a difficult first year, 
1990, the period 1991-93 was characterized by some favorable 
objective conditions that would have enabled some areas to be 
streamlined more speedily. 
  [Garcia] Such as? 
  [Aninat] The modernization of the whole apparatus of 
government itself and an earlier incursion into capital markets, 
even though a good bill has been submitted to Congress. 
  [Garcia] The same one that has been sitting there for a 
year, 
and has not yet been passed? 
  [Aninat] Yes, but one must bear in mind that the executive 
branch is not entirely to blame for that. 
  [Garcia] Chile has been rated internationally as Plus Triple 
B concerning investment risks. Many people wonder what the use 
of this classification is, if there are not a greater number of 
companies that can invest abroad, if the AFP's [Pension Fund 
Managing Companies] are limited, if banks are unable to invest 
abroad... if there are also so many restrictions to bringing in 
and remitting capital abroad. 
  [Aninat] That area, which is quite complex, is one of my 
favorite subjects, because what Foxley and I tried to do with 
the famous Eurobonds was to fully place Chile's name on 
voluntary financial markets. 
  [Garcia] And that has been accomplished. 
  [Aninat] But it was properly accomplished, thanks to that 
first signal at that time. We have therefore indeed derived 
benefits from something that you omitted -- the perception, the 
classification of risk country has not only improved with regard 
to how foreigners assess us, but also as to how Chilean 
businessmen themselves and local agents view our country. I 
deem that the domestic investment rate would not have been as 
high as it currently is if we had not managed to attain that 
favorable reinsertion abroad. 
  [Garcia] But we continue to talk at the level of perception. 
We have a country of a quality that very few in Latin America 
can dream about. Can we take better advantage of this situation? 
  [Aninat] Progress must be made. I would like to coordinate 
my work with other members of the cabinet, and especially with 
the Central Bank, to continue to make progress on what you are 
talking about. We need a greater presence abroad for the 
Chilean AFP [Pension Fund Administration Boards], and the 
gradual participation of first class (he emphasized this) 
Chilean banks abroad. I feel the same way about the insurance 
companies and the investment funds. In other words, continue to 
internationalize our financial market further to integrate it 
with the rest of the world. This does not mean taking on 
anything and in any order. 
  [Garcia] Where is the limit? 
  [Aninat] The idea is not to be liberal just for the sake of 
being liberal; things should be done scientifically. And 
sometimes the private sector, or part of it, either because it's 
the fashion or the passion, tend to jump in with both feet 
without evaluating all of the risks. 
  [Garcia] How can you pretend to be moving faster on the 
internationalization of the Chilean economy if you said that the 
Chilean Central Bank "is excellent but conservative?" 
  [Aninat] It seems that all the central banks around the 
world 
are conservative, and in this sense they are an interesting 
counterbalance for many pressures. But I am lucky, excuse me 
for speaking in the first person, to know the five current bank 
members very well. Therefore, I believe the issue of 
coordination and communication with the Central Bank will go 
well... At least that is my intention. 
  [Garcia] You said you want to work to motivate all Chileans. 
If when you take over the ministry there are 4 million poor 
people, how many fewer will there be six years from now? 
  [Aninat] I would not dare to establish a goal in figures 
now, 
because I am just now -- as some people say -- reading the 
specific tasks ahead. What is clear is that Chile has the 
moral, ethical, political, and social obligation to drastically 
reduce the number of Chileans affected by poverty. And in 
particular, it has the obligation to improve the situation of 
the 1.2 million people who live in extreme poverty. 
  [Garcia] Will an important part of the resources be 
appropriated to them? 
  [Aninat] An important part of the administration will be 
dedicated to them. And this goes beyond resources. It means 
evaluation, costs, benefits, and the rational use and greater 
sophistication of the many social programs. 
  [Garcia] What does that mean? Is that a criticism of the 
effectiveness of social spending over the last four years? 
  [Aninat] It is not a criticism. But if on the one hand one 
studies what has been done in the different types of programs in 
health, housing, social security, and on the other studies the 
requirements of the new times, it can be seen that some of these 
programs were created more than two decades ago. I believe the 
time has come to review whether the type of development, 
administration, and management involved in social spending is 
appropriate for 1994. 
  [Garcia] But does that mean the same amount of resources, 
the 
same amount of taxes? 
  [Aninat] There is a legislative mandate that must be 
respected. The tax debate is already over, and therefore the key 
issue here is growth. We must have growth in order to continue 
to improve equity and increase social spending. This is 
essential. 
  [Garcia] Are you afraid of the threat posed by the 
international recession which is still hanging over our country? 
  [Aninat] I am not afraid of it, but rather concerned about 
it. I believe we should put it clearly. With Germany 
registering a negative growth rate this year, and France and 
Italy a zero growth rate, and in the Group of Seven only the 
United States beginning to recuperate, we must necessarily 
behave with extreme cautiousness. 
  [Garcia] What does that mean? 
  [Aninat] It means that the level of spending in our economy 
should be entirely consistent with its level of income and with 
its potential productivity. 
  [Garcia] Based on that, would you support reducing the 
current level of spending? The 1994 budget provides for 
expenditures surpassing the growth rate of the economy... 
  [Aninat] I cannot yet draw such a specific conclusion, but I 
would say that as far as making income consistent with spending 
is concerned, what we have begun to do is to examine the final 
figures of the economy in the last quarter of 1993, to see 
whether there is actual consistency or whether supplementary 
measures must be enforced. 
  [Garcia] What is your perception of what might occur in the 
world economy in 1994? 
  [Aninat] I believe the world economy will very slowly begin 
to recuperate. It will be a slow, partial, and unequal 
recuperation, with several countries still remaining stagnant. 
  [Garcia] Could 1994 be even more complex for Chile? 
  [Aninat] It might eventually turn out to be more complex. 
  [Garcia] The balance of trade is expected to register a 
deficit that will be considerably higher than the one registered 
this year, which will be at approximately $900 million. 
  [Aninat] Our current account deficit remains within limits 
that we can manage easily. Therefore, what we and the Central 
Bank should do is carefully evaluate, as a whole, the evolution 
of the terms of exchange, the balance of trade performance, and 
the current account deficit. 
  [Garcia] You have said that you do not yet want to set any 
targets. Do you believe Chile can expect a one-digit inflation 
rate for 1997, as Villarzu stated? 
  [Aninat] As I have already told you, I cannot make 
categorical, specific statements now. But what I can promise 
all Chileans is that the target of continuing to gradually 
reduce inflation will remain a priority for the Finance 
Ministry. [passage omitted] 
  [Garcia] Your slogan has been "not hasty, but in-depth 
privatization." What would be your first suggestion for 
privatization? 
  [Aninat] I would like to carefully study the list of 
enterprises that are currently run by Corfo [Production 
Development Corporation], and which are of various types. There 
are enterprises in the areas of shipping, transport, water 
supply, and sewage, there are agriculture undertakings, etc. 
  [Garcia] What would you suggest be done with them? 
  [Aninat] As I am saying, I believe it is high time that the 
list be very carefully studied in order to establish targets and 
priorities on a careful timetable, so as to make progress in a 
determined manner toward the private sector in those areas. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Garcia] What are your plans for Codelco [Copper 
Corporation]? 
  [Aninat] I believe we need a sophisticated, comprehensive 
view of large-scale mining. First, because Chile has a 
comparative and also absolute advantage in the area and, 
therefore, cannot mortgage this sector. Consequently, from the 
viewpoint of the country, it is necessary to continue promoting 
investment in the mining sector. 
  [Garcia] The point is how to do it, with a privately-owned 
or 
state-run Codelco? 
  [Aninat] We have a state management problem in the sector. 
We have therefore thought about creating a holding with 
branches managed by independent corporations run by standard 
regulations. What is a necessary step. Creating self-supporting 
branches with responsible management. [passage omitted] 
  [Garcia] Did you participate in the design of the economic 
program? 
  [Aninat] I did in various parts, especially and very deeply 
in the foreign policy chapter. 
  [Garcia] Don't you think your own perceptions are bolder 
than 
those of the program in terms of liberalization and 
privatization? 
  [Aninat] I would say perceptions are the same, with some 
differences in rate or speed.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- The night before he was murdered, 
Oswaldo Cruz Junior, president of the ABC [Sao Paulo's 
industrial belt] Highways Driver Union, granted an interview to 
the NEWSPAPER OF GREATER ABC in which he accuses Luis Inacio 
Lula da Silva, the virtual PT [Workers Party] presidential 
candidate, of heading a scheme to transfer union funds to the 
party. 
  He told the newspaper: "Sometimes Lula personally asked us, 
the labor leaders, to collect money from members." 
  Oswaldo Cruz Junior was murdered by Jose Benedito de Souza 
on 
6 January. Souza was a supporter of his uncle, union secretary 
general Cicero Bezerra da Silva, who recently accused Cruz of 
illegal enrichment. From the moment he returned to his post, 
Cruz [who returned as part of a deal to leave his post to 
Bezerra and run for president at the drivers federation] 
reported the irregular transfer of union funds to the PT. 
During the interview, Oswaldo Cruz Junior revealed that the 
transfer of funds to the PT was systematic and that the 
operation was carried out in three different ways. One way was 
to label the transfer of funds as special union expenses. 
  "The drivers union spend 15 million cruzeiros in special 
union expenses during 1993 alone," Oswaldo Cruz Junior said. 
  Cruz reported that the second way to transfer funds to the 
PT 
was to increase union contributions, authorized by ghost 
assemblies. 
  "Sometimes we published edicts convening assemblies to 
authorize discounts of up to 6 percent. The trick was that the 
edicts were not distributed, no one came to the assembly, and 
the discounts were approved," Cruz said. 
  Oswaldo Cruz Junior's interview in the NEWSPAPER OF GREATER 
ABC states that the third mechanism for transferring union funds 
to the PT was the manipulation of deposits held for social 
security contributions and monthly contributions by companies, 
which were directly sent to the unions as of 1988. 
  "If you were to audit the ABC Metallurgical Union you would 
see that the union almost went bankrupt in 1989," Cruz stressed. 
  Oswaldo Cruz said that the union contracted Cotrigal 
Graphics 
of San Andres to print Lula's presidential campaign material in 
1989, but the material was printed in the workers' newspaper 
CHAPEU DE BICO which increased its number of issues from 10,000 
to 300,000 in a single month. 
  "He will not be able to deny it after I show you what was 
published," the union leader said in a challenging manner. 
  Cruz added that in February 1992 5 million cruzeiros was 
transferred to the Santo Andre branch of the PT. The union 
money was to have been used to purchase of the party 
headquarters. Cruz said that the PT Municipal Building was to 
be purchased by the drivers, the chemical, and the metallurgical 
unions. During the interview Cruz said that he received several 
calls from Deputy Arlindo Chinaglia, the PT state president, 
proposing a deal to stop denouncing Lula's party. 
  Cruz said he had proof, adding that he had a meeting 
scheduled with Senators Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA) [Progressive 
Renewal Party-Para] and Esperidian Amim (PPR-SC) [PPR-Santa 
Catarina] for 11 January to talk about the CPI [Congressional 
Investigating Committee] on the CUT [Sole Workers Center]. 
During the interview with NEWSPAPER OF GREATER ABC, the labor 
leader produced a box of video tapes which, he said, contained 
proof of th? transfer of union funds to the PT. 
  Antonio Carlos Monico, former Santo Andre PT president, 
yesterday denied allegations that ABC unions had ever 
transferred money to the PT for the electoral campaign of party 
candidates. Monico was named by union leader Oswaldo Cruz 
Junior, who was murdered on 6 January, as a witness of the PT 
use of union funds in electoral campaigns.

  [Text] Former Sao Paulo State Governor Orestes Quercia 
last week opened the battle against the so-called Gaucho Group 
[from Rio Grande do Sul State] to obtain predominance within the 
PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. The Gaucho Group is 
headed by Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS [PMDB-Rio Grande do Sul State]), 
the government's leader in the Senate. The Gaucho Group 
supports the candidacy of former Social Security Minister 
Antonio Britto in the upcoming presidential elections. 
  The Quercia faction has been strengthened by former 
President 
Jose Sarney's announcement that he will stay in the PMDB. 
Harassed in the PMDB and believing he had lost Quercia's 
support, Sarney had tried to launch his candidacy for president 
through the PP [Popular Party], PFL [Liberal Front Party], PTB 
[Brazilian Labor Party], and even through the PL [Liberal 
Party], but he was not accepted by any of these parties. 
  On 15 January, the Quercia and Sarney factions will resume 
their old alliance and will announce their intention of getting 
the PMDB to break with the government. This was announced 
during a luncheon at Sarney's home.

<F P=106> [Report by Hermes Sucre Serrano] </F>
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, the "Solidarity" party political 
commission selected journalist and businessman Samuel Lewis 
Galindo to be the presidential candidate for the 1994 elections. 
Carlos Clement was selected as the candidate for the first vice 
presidency, and Maria "Marisin" Villalaz de Arias was selected 
to be the second vice presidential candidate. 
  A resolution from the party's political commission indicates 
that Solidarity meets the necessary conditions and has the 
necessary strength to head a presidential slate as a result of 
its image, active membership, discipline, organization, 
prestige, determination, and consensus to accomplish the unity 
and progress of the Panamanian people. 
  The resolution states: "Solidarity has been taken into 
account by other important political forces, which have 
contacted the party to gain its support with the intention of 
participating in the next election process." 
  Lewis Galindo's nomination was announced yesterday at one of 
the party's main political centers located in the Obarrio 
neighborhood, after a lengthy meeting between the party's main 
leaders. Samuel Lewis Galindo, a principal member of the 
National Brewery board of directors, expressed appreciation for 
the nomination and promised he will head a civilized political 
campaign aimed at eliminating hatred and uniting the Panamanian 
family. 
  "Neither I nor my party will sow hatred. Today, more than 
ever, we must make a joint effort to help solve the numerous 
problems that are devouring our community's underpriviliged 
groups," he pointed out. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday, the presidential candidate stated that 
Panamanians 
are tired of disputes and conflicts which lead nowhere. "We are 
the party that will save the country from chaos and hate mongers 
who would rather have individual confrontation instead of 
striving for useful things," Lewis Galindo restated. He said 
that under the motto "leadership, honesty, and work," Solidarity 
gathers Panamanians from all social levels to give answers to a 
society that feels unprotected at this time. 
  First vice president candidate Carlos Clement was the public 
works minister at one time. He is an architect specializing in 
urban development. He is also one of the party's founders and is 
currently party treasurer. 
  Second vice president nominee Dr. Marisin Villalaz de Arias 
was director of the National Medical Association. She was active 
during the civic struggle against Manuel Antonio Noriega's 
dictatorship. She was a Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement 
candidate for legislator for the 8-9 Circuit during the 1989 
elections. 
  Abraham Martinez, Solidarity party political affairs 
secretary, told LA PRENSA that the slate headed by Samuel Lewis 
Galindo will be recommended to the national directorate during 
the national convention. Martinez also said Fernando Manfredo 
decided to abstain from participating on the slate in order to, 
as he put it, support any new alliances the party may enter. 
  The political affairs secretary holds that Solidarity is the 
party with the most number of followers and greatest drawing 
power. "We are working on specifics. On Tuesday 10 January [date 
as published] we will completely sweep through the San Miguelito 
District," he concludes.

<F P=106> [Report by Julia Elena Alvear; from the "Telemetro Reports" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Amid the political agitation the country is 
experiencing, the first political attack was perpetrated against 
the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] headquarters located in 
Juan Diaz. 
  An explosive device went off during the predawn hours at the 
PRD offices in Juan Diaz. As this video shows [video shows 
policemen gathering evidence from explosion site, iron door 
open, PRD office glass door], the device was apparently placed 
outside the building, and the blast only reached the front light 
of the building and smeared the walls and side wall with a gray 
substance. 
  Specialized units of the Explosive Department of the 
National 
Police appeared at the explosion site. They gathered the first 
evidence to determine what kind of explosives was used, although 
it is presumed it may have been industrial-type explosives. 
  PRD members blamed progovernment parties for the attack and 
termed the blast as a threat. 
  [Begin recording] [Ricardo Vega, member of the PRD Political 
Commission] Evidently it seems that this is a clear expression 
of threats affecting an electoral process, which we hope would 
be clean. This is the first attack perpetrated against a PRD 
office, and we believe this is the beginning of an escalation of 
attacks that will occur amid the electoral atmosphere. 
  [Baltazar Aizpurua, PRD prosecutor] We know and are sure 
this 
is the result of the goverment's desperation over the victory 
the PRD will obtain on 8 May. [end recording] 
  This is the first attack against a political party--less 
than 
four months away from the elections. 
  The Electoral Tribunal described the attack as 
reprehensible. 
  [Begin Magistrate Guillermo Marquez Amado recording] We have 
not confirmed the point yet; that is the fundamental point I 
want to make. Second, I want to state strongly that it is 
reprehensible, from every point of view, that Panamanians have 
not learned yet to settle our differences civilly, like brothers 
and members of a single national family. No matter from where 
the attack comes, it is inconvenient and unfair to use our hands 
to hit each other instead of using them to progress.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 11 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  According to estimates by government and business sources, 
the Panamanian economy experienced growth of 6-7 percent in 
1993. According to the General Commerce Directorate of the 
Commerce and Industries Ministry, 6,938 commercial licenses were 
issued nationwide up to November 1993. The issued licenses 
generated $28 million in invested capital and approximately 
$327,000 in taxes. The General Industries Directorate granted 
7,513 import permits, which represents a 15-percent increase 
compared with 1992. According to figures from the Planning and 
Economic Policy Ministry, the number of public employees fell by 
4,943 -- a 3.4-percent decrease -- between 20 December 1989 and 
31 October 1993. For the same period, however, salaries 
increased from $64.4 million to $69.6 million, which implies a 
7.9-increase in the government payroll. With the Voluntary 
Retirement Program, the current government plans to reduce the 
government payroll by about 6,000 jobs, which will save the 
state $30 million. Through November 1993, some 2,356 public 
servants had joined the program. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA 
in Spanish 9 Jan 94 p 1D) 
  In 1993, Panama imported $2 billion in goods and exported 
$480 million. Panamanian exports from 1979 to 1992 have not 
surpassed $500 million; however, imports for 1993 only reached 
$2 billion. Bananas, Panama's leading export, were down $5 
million through August 1993 compared with 1992. Prospects for 
banana exports are not very optimistic because of EC 
restrictions on Latin American banana imports. 
  Shrimp, Panama's second leading export, experienced a modest 
growth of $1 million through August 1993 over the $41.6 million 
earned in the same period in 1992. According to preliminary 
figures from the Comptroller's Office, Panama imported $1.589 
billion through August 1993. Panama mainly exported crude oil, 
distilled combustible oils, medicines, and vehicles. (Panama 
City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 9 Jan 94 p 1C) 
  Panamanian Tourism Institute Director Anel Beliz said the 
tourism industry experienced a 10-percent growth in 1993, 
contributing $260 million to the economy. In 1993, 375,000 
tourists visited Panama, which means 15,000 more tourists than 
in 1992. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 8 Jan 94 p 9A) 
  Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria said international 
financial institutions will give Panama $234 million during the 
first quarter of 1994. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 
4 Jan 94 p 2A) 
  According to Jose Delgado, deputy director of the General 
Consular and Ships Directorate, Panama moved into first place in 
the international ship registry with 777 vessels and collected 
$41 million in revenues in 1993. Delgado said that up to 
November 1993, Panama was ahead of Liberia by 1.2 million tons. 
He added that the net growth registered during 1993 was $4.3 
million and 290 vessels. 
  Delgado stated that Panama has maintained a constant growth 
since 1990 regarding ship registry. According to Delgado, growth 
will remain constant so long as the international shipyards 
continue building new vessels. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in 
Spanish 10 Jan p 8C)

  [Text] Army Commander Division General Lino Cesar Oviedo 
made it clear yesterday that the Armed Forces commander-in-chief 
appoints officers to their respective posts. Oviedo stated that 
the chain of command stipulates that the Armed Forces 
commander-in-chief conveys appointments to the 1st Army Corps 
commander who advises the 3d Cavalry Division, headquartered in 
Curuguaty. 
  On 9 January a report was published based on information 
gleaned from the Army's weekly, which states that the 
commander-in-chief of the Paraguayan Armed Forces -- namely, 
engineer [President Juan Carlos] Wasmosy -- received orders from 
Army Commander Gen. Oviedo on the appointment of officers to 
various posts. 
  Asked if there was any mistake in the text, Gen. Oviedo 
confirmed that the president appointed the officer in question, 
following a resolution of the office of the Army Command. The 
Army commander emphasized: "Resolutions are different from 
instructions. I give instructions, but this was not the case." 
  Oviedo hinted at the fact that the NOTICIAS report was 
misleading. He said that, following orders, he installed the 
chosen officer. 
  On a different theme, the Army commander denied that 
officers 
and troops are being kept in subhuman conditions in the 3d Army 
Corps. He pointed out that this could not happen because the 
barrack facilities are in perfect condition. 
  Incidentally, the Army commander's schedule next month 
includes a visit to the barracks of the 3d Army Corps, which is 
headquartered in the town of Mariscal Estigarribia.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Ecuadoran economic developments monitored through 11 
January. The source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  The National Secretariat for Administrative Development, 
SENDA, reported that during 1993, 25,198 public employees 
stopped working for the government. According to SENDA, the 
state thus reduced its size by reducing appropriations, 
eliminating vacant positions, and not renewing contracts. This 
is part of the effort to modernize the administration. SENDA 
reported that in August 1992 the number of public servants was 
366,227, and by 31 December 1993 the figure dropped to 341,773. 
(Paris AFP in Spanish 2132 GMT 4 Jan 94) 
  The European Union, EU, approved a donation for 
approximately 
$2.8 million to finance social welfare and ecological protection 
programs. An EU spokesman said that the aid will permit the 
implementation of a cholera prevention program to be carried out 
by French experts and Health Ministry officials. He added that 
an ecological evaluation will also be conducted within the 
program on the effects of oil exploitation in the jungle. (Quito 
Voz de los Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 4 Jan 94) 
  The Ecuadoran State Petroleum Enterprise, Petroecuador, 
announced that a barrel of crude was sold at an average daily 
price of $10.27 in December, thus making the average yearly 
price $14.45 in 1993. In addition, the Energy Ministry reported 
that the 1993 Ecuadoran oil production figure was approximately 
124.8 million barrels, 6 percent more than the preceding year. 
According to provisional figures, average daily production was 
341,700 barrels in 1993 in comparison to 334,400 barrels in 
1992. (Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 4 Jan 94) 
  Petroecuador reported that a new oil well, which initially 
produced 500 barrels per day, was discovered in the Amazon 
region. The well is located near Auca well, eastern Ecuador, 
which accounts for 80 percent of the country's oil production. 
Petroecuador President Federico Veintimilla said that an 
intense exploration program will continue in 1994. (Paris AFP 
in Spanish 1635 GMT 6 Jan 94) 
  Energy and Mines Minister Francisco Acosta stated that 
Texaco 
has filed suit against the Ecuadoran Republic for more than $500 
million. He also said that the government has asked the firm 
for compensation based on technical, tax, and ecological 
reasons. Acosta noted that an agreement could be reached 
relating to Ecuadoran interests and recognition of compensation 
for Ecuador. Rodrigo Perez, the Texaco representative in 
Ecuador, said that an agreement has been reached in principle on 
the technical and tax aspects. With regard to the ecological 
issue, he said that the results of a survey are being reviewed. 
(Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 6 Jan 94) 
  Ecuadoran trade showed a positive balance between January 
and 
October 1993 of $693 million, compared to $745 million for the 
same period in 1992. The Central Bank disclosed that exports 
amounted to $2.4 billion and imports were $1.7 billion in 1993 
compared to $2.5 billion in exports and $1.790 billion in 
imports during the first 10 months of 1992. (Quito Voz de los 
Andes in Spanish 2300 GMT 6 Jan 94) 
  President Sixto Duran-Ballen authorized the issuance of 
government bonds for more than $909 million to cover the balance 
of the foreign debt which must be serviced by the country's 
Central Bank. A presidential decree published in the Official 
Registry stated that the bonds will be issued in several 
currencies and will be paid in sucres. This bond issue will be 
used to service the foreign debt with commercial banks, the 
World Bank, and the Export, Import Bank of Japan, the government 
newspaper noted. The Ecuadoran foreign debt amounts to more 
than $12.6 billion. According to the Official Registry, the 
bond issue will allow the government to cover pending balances 
for several credits. (Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish 2300 
GMT 11 Jan 94) 
  President Sixto Duran-Ballen authorized the issuance of 
three 
government bonds in sucres for an equivalent of $272.6 million 
to capitalize the Ecuadoran Central Bank, an executive decree 
stated. According to the decree, a bond will be issued for 17.8 
billion sucres, for two years, including a grace period of one 
year, at the basic interest rate that is in effect at the 
beginning of each quarter. The amortization will be made in two 
equal and consecutive biannual quotas that will expire on 30 
June and 31 December 1995. (Quito Voz de los Andes in Spanish

December 1993, while the accumulated price index for the year 
reached 45.9 percent, compared to 31.9 percent in 1992. The 
Venezuelan Central Bank had estimated the 1993 inflation rate at 
46 percent. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2121 GMT 4 Jan 94) 
  Lagoven, a subsidiary of Venezuelan Petroleum, purchased 
equipment and material manufactured in Venezuela for 28.507 
billion bolivares, which is 68 percent of the company's total 
equipment investment in 1993. It was also reported that 
purchases abroad decreased $16.244 billion bolivares. (Caracas 
EL DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish 4 Jan 94 p 21) 
  According to the Central Statistics and Data Processing

October 1993 was $2.964 billion, which is $491 million (19.6 
percent) more than during the same period in 1992. According to 
the same source, the total import value between January and 
October 1993 was $9.364 billion, a reduction of 11.6 percent

  [Text] The announcement that the Search Bloc has arrived in 
Valle del Cauca has upset Tulua Mayor Gustavo Alvarez who said 
nobody requested permission from him to house the Search Bloc 
members in that city's police academy. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Mayor Alvarez, 
what 
have you learned about the presence of the Search Bloc here in 
Tulua? 
  [Alvarez] I have no official information on that. Neither 
the national government authorities nor the police authorities 
have notified me that the Search Bloc members will be housed in 
the Simon Bolivar Academy. However, I heard that report in a 
Voice of America broadcast and I read it on the front page of 
today's edition of OCCIDENTE. 
  [Reporter] What does the Search Bloc's arrival represent for 
the residents of Tulua? 
  [Alvarez] As city mayor, I will accept it. However, as a 
resident of Valle del Cauca, I am truly sorry. I have said that 
the Search Bloc in Valle del Cauca is following the orders of 
the U.S. ambassador and State Department officials. Just two 
days after Pablo Escobar was killed, they said that a war had to 
be waged in Valle del Cauca. I think Valle del Cauca does not 
need a war, and I think it can follow the law through reasonable 
means, through a dialogue, and seek solutions so that there will 
be no war here. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Colombian Foreign Minister Nohemi </F>
Sanin by Juan Garzo; place not given; from the "NTC News" 
newscast-- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Garzo] The big news of today is the crash of a 
Venezuelan helicopter in Puerto Rico, Saravena, Arauca 
Intendency. The Armed Forces inspector general has reported that 
the helicopter crashed in Colombian territory after being hit by 
guerrillas. 
  Minister Sanin, you arrived in the country a few hours ago; 
what information do you have about this incident? 
  [Sanin] I arrived in the country last night from my 
vacation, 
but I have been in contact with the president for the past 
several days. The government is deeply concerned. The 
president has ordered an investigation from the Defense Ministry 
and Colombian Foreign Ministry. We are going to present to him 
the findings this afternoon. The Prosecutor General's Office 
has conducted a preliminary investigation, the results of which 
will be presented to the Foreign Ministry this afternoon. 
  I will be going to Venezuela on 12 January to sign a 
prisoners repatriation treaty, and I will be speaking with 
President Ramon J. Velasquez, the president-elect, the defense 
minister, the foreign minister, and the Venezuelan attorney 
general to present to them the results of the Colombian 
investigations to improve integration and cooperation efforts to 
avoid a continuation of criminal activities outside the legal 
framework of the two countries. I repeat: We are deeply 
concerned, and this afternoon we will decide, jointly with the 
president, what to do about this matter. 
  [Garzo] You have already spoken with President Gaviria. When 
this type of incident occurs, what measures are adopted at the 
Foreign Ministry level? What type of statement is issued? 
  [Sanin] Investigations are ordered, consuls must prepare a 
report, and experts go to work on territorial sovereignty, 
prisons, or whatever matter happens to be the issue. We are 
then presented with a report from the consuls and experts 
assigned by the Foreign Ministry. We have to receive reports 
from both the Defense Ministry and Prosecutor General's Office 
to then present all the conclusions to the president, with whom 
we always decide what action must be taken. 
  [Garzo] Can this be seen as a criminal act? 
  [Sanin] This is a very grave action that could involve one 
or 
more criminal actions; this matter is also being investigated in 
Venezuela, according to what Venezuelan authorities have told 
me. We are on top of the situation and do not want to diminish 
the seriousness of the incident, because national sovereignty, 
citizens' lives, respect, personal injuries, and many other 
factors are involved, and all of this is being investigated in 
the two countries. 
  [Garzo] Considering the problems that have emerged during 
recent months due to the guerrilla presence on the border with 
Venezuela, do you believe the Venezuelan Government really wants 
to resolve these problems? 
  [Sanin] Yes. We have tried to hold a meeting between the 
defense, foreign minister, and justice ministers of both 
countries in recent days, but considering that Venezuela will 
have a new government on 3 February, we have agreed that the 
meeting, which will also include the government and interior 
ministers of Colombia and Venezuela, should take place once the 
new Venezuelan Government is installed on 3 February. 
  [Garzo] That is, it is urgent that the defense ministers 
hold 
a meeting to clear up this situation and draft a common strategy 
to fight the guerrillas in that zone. 
  [Sanin] Yes. Once there is a new government in Venezuela the 
government, interior, defense, Foreign Ministry, and justice 
ministers will hold a meeting to avoid, through cooperation and 
integration, criminal activities on either side of the border. 
  [Garzo] I want to ask you about another matter before you 
leave. How is President Gaviria's candidacy for the OAS post 
progressing? 
  [Sanin] The truth is that all Colombians must feel very 
proud 
that several chiefs of state have established contact with our 
president and asked him to allow them to present him as a 
candidate for the post of secretary general of the OAS, 
America's most important forum. The president is analyzing 
this. We should all recall the golden era Colombia enjoyed with 
former President Alberto Lleras Camargo in this organization. 
We are happy about this situation and waiting for President 
Gaviria's decision.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 11 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  The National Administrative Department of Statistics, DANE, 
reported on 30 December that retail sales rose by 3.7 percent 
from January to October 1993, compared to the same period in 
1992. Furniture and home appliance stores registered a growth of 
14.1 percent in sales. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 
31 Dec 93 p 1C) 
  A report by the National Association of Industrialists, 
ANDI, 
indicated that in 1993 the economy grew at the 5.16 percent rate 
announced by the government. The contribution of the industrial 
sector to this growth was less than 1 percent, meaning the 
Colombian economy in 1993 was marked by low vitality in 
productive activity, it added. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO 
SIGLO in Spanish 31 Dec 94 p 27) 
  A cold spell in Santa Fe de Bogota's savannas destroyed 30 
percent of the areas's flower harvest. In addition to harming 
exports, approximately 26,000 workers will lose their jobs. The 
cold weather also destroyed the potato harvests in Boyaca and 
Cundinamarca Department, the country's chief suppliers. (Santa 
Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1730 GMT 
7 Jan 94) 
  The government granted a 21-percent pay increase to all its 
public officials, except the members of the military and some 
members of the Judicial Branch, who will receive a higher 
increase as part of the strategy to control public order and 
upgrade the system of justice. The increase represents 0.9 
percent of the total production of goods and services of the 
economy or the GDP. The state indicated the raise will not hurt 
its macroeconomic goals because it has been included in the 
estimates for the 1994 budget. During the first half of 1993, 
the state's total spending grew 39 percent, and functioning 
costs rose 46.2 percent. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in 
Spanish 5 Jan 94 pp 1a, 6b) 
  Textile manufacturers have rejected the government 
announcement to lift the port restriction on textile imports and 
proposed a "civic overseer" to assist customs in contraband 
control and detect fraudulent under invoicing. Jose Manuel 
Arias Carrioza, president of the Colombian Association of 
Textile Producers, sent a letter to Pedro Nel Ospina, director 
of the National Customs and Tax Directorate, complaining that 
port controls have slackened. Arias reports that 80 percent of 
Colombian textile factories suffered losses in 1993. The "civic 
overseers" are not intended to check customs work, but to ensure 
that the type of textiles imported do not compete unfairly with 
local production. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 5 Jan 
94 pp 1a, 8b) 
  Colombian coal exports increased 27 percent in 1993 with 
shipments totalling 13.7 millions tons and worth $464 million, 
the Colombian Coal Enterprise, Carbocol, reported. During 1992, 
exports were 2 million tons less than the amount of coal 
produced. Carbocol disclosed that in 1993 production costs were 
reduced by 10 percent from $272 million to $245 million. 
Colombia faced a tough situation during 1993 when world coal 
surpluses topped 11 million tons, thus reducing long term 
contract prices by five dollars per ton. Currently, Colombia 
sells coal at $35 per ton maximum. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in 
Spanish 1735 GMT 7 Jan 94) 
  Housing and food prices were the main culprits for the 
government overshooting its 22 percent inflation rate goal for 
1993. The inflation for 1993 has been reported at 22.6 percent. 
Dane Director Rodolfo Uribe says that the 1.13 percent increase 
in Christmas prices was mainly due to increases in the cost of 
gasoline at the end of the year. Housing costs for December 
reflected the greatest increases and were rated at 1.37 percent 
followed by food that registered a 1.18 percent increase. 
Clothing, health, transportation, and education registered 
below average increases. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in 
Spanish 3 Jan 94 pp 1, 9)

  [Excerpts] The solemn reopening session of the Haitian 
Parliament was aborted on 10 January in disorder and confusion, 
making a parliamentary solution to the crisis even more 
difficult. Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the Senate and of the 
National Assembly, left his seat under police protection after 
he was manhandled by hostile parliamentarians because he wanted 
to end the session. During these incidents, Mr. Jean-Louis was 
protected by several parliamentarians, including Deputy Frantz 
Robert Monde, who physically intervened. The diplomatic corps 
quickly left the Parliament under the protection of their 
bodyguards. We still do not know if a new session will be held 
today. 
  Mr. Frantz Robert Monde, an independent who votes with the 
Socialist bloc, solemnly warned his colleagues about the threats 
of anti-parliamentarism by the left and by the right. In a brief 
statement to AFP, he said that there was a real danger that the 
extreme right would take advantage of a parliamentary vacuum if 
the Parliament did not agree to find a Haitian solution to the 
crisis. 
  The neo-Duvalierists of the Revolutionary Front for Haitian 
Advancement and Progress, FRAPH, threatened the Parliament with 
a mob dissolution if its members did not find a solution 
quickly. The incidents were triggered by the presence of the 
parliamentarians elected during the controversial partial 
elections of January 1993, held by a government not recognized 
by the international community. The Parliament was going to open 
debates aimed at reaching a final vote on the problem caused by 
the election of those parliamentarians, but two senators 
favoring President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, namely Eudrice 
Raymond and Judenel Jean, wanted to leave their seats. Their 
adversaries, who reproached them for invalidating the quorum and 
for thus making the continuation of the session impossible, 
physically prevented them from leaving the Parliament before 
things degenerated. 
  After several hours of procrastination, the National 
Assembly 
scheduled for 10 January at 0100 eventually took place at about 
0405 at the Haitian Parliament, with the question of the 18 
January parliamentarians at the heart of the debates because 
they were present at the session to have their voices heard, 
although their names were not cited during the roll call. 
  The tension was rising, and in the area surrounding the 
Parliament demonstrators called for the dissolution of the 45th 
legislature due to ineffectivenss and called for the transfer of 
power to the Court of Cassation so new general elections can be 
held in the country. To realize all that, they demanded the 
intervention of the Army. Meanwhile, inside the Legislative 
Palace, with a very fragile quorum at the Senate -- with 11 
senators present -- the parliamentarians met in National 
Assembly in the presence of political and diplomatic 
personalities. Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the 
National Assembly, pointed out the needs of the time and hoped 
that a solution could be found to the problem of the 18 January 
1993 parliamentarians. [passage omitted] 
  Everything was going to fly to pieces when -- after the 
departure of the National Front for Change and Democracy [FNCD] 
deputies [as heard] -- Sen. Eudrice wanted to leave as well to 
protest the insertion into the agenda the question of the 18 
January parliamentarians. He stressed the reasons that had 
prompted him to decide to leave the room. 
  [Begin Raymond recording, in Creole] The assembly is not 
supposed to have other elements than [words indistinct] of the 
day of the National Assembly, opening of the assembly, and 
closing the agenda. Once the assembly has taken upon itself the 
right to add another element to the agenda, personally (?I have 
lost) the obligation I had to be present today. It is a fact 
that I have met my obligation as I am present within the scope 
of the assembly; I participated in the opening. As far as I am 
concerned, I do not have to be present when other elements are 
added to the agenda. [end recording] 
  It was finally chaos when Judenel Jean decided to leave as 
well. The 18 January parliamentarians, notably Gabriel Ancion, 
Margareth Martin, Pierre Romel Manigat, and Rousseau, hindered 
the departure of this parliamentarian. [Passage indistinct] This 
was the situation at the time when the 18 January 
parliamentarians were trying to hinder the departure of Senators 
Judenel Jean and Eudrice Raymond. Those scenes unfolded in the 
presence of foreign diplomats who came to attend the session. 
It should be pointed out that three out of four ministers of 
the resigning government departed even before the beginning of 
the session. They wanted to protest because the protocol 
official of the Haitian Parliament asked them to let the 
representatives of the Army, the Port-au-Prince bar, and the 
governor of the Central Bank take the first seats.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 11 Jan (EFE) -- Haitian deputies got 
into a fist fight today, Monday [as received], when the first 
session of the year of the National Assembly became a boxing 
match between supporters and opponents of deposed constitutional 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  The fights broke off after it was decided not to allow the 
participation of 13 senators elected in the 18 January 1992 
elections, whose election has been challenged by the parties 
supporting Aristide. 
  Senator Eudrice Raymond of the National Front for Change and 
Democracy (FNDC), which brought Aristide to power, attempted to 
leave the building so as to prevent the quorum from being 
formed, but the challenged senators closed the doors. 
  It was then when challenged pro-Duvalier Senator Gabriel 
Ancion hit Raymond and later attacked centrist Senator Judnel 
Jean. 
  Assembly President Firmin Jean Louis was also hit in the 
face 
by Deputy Pierre-Francois Vital, while Jean Louis' bodyguard was 
apprehended by armed civilians and police. 
  In light of the chaos and panic prevailing at the assembly, 
most of the legislators decided to abandon the building. It is 
not yet known when the legislative process will be resumed, 
given the new situation.

  [Text] The international conference in Miami, proposed by 
the president-in-exile, is convened for 14, 15 and 16 January. 
We have learned that the Haitian Army will not participate in 
this conference since the invitation was addressed to a senior 
military officer, who is not recognized either by the 
international community or by Father Aristide's own government. 
This information was collected by the AFP from a well-informed 
source. 
  Let us recall that this letter of invitation to this 
conference was addressed to General Jean-Claude Duperval, the 
Army second in command who President Aristide had appointed this 
past December as Army commander in chief, while dismissing 
General Cedras, the current commander in chief. 
  Prime Minister Robert Malval and the members of his 
government had refused to hand over the letters of appointment 
and of dismissal to their addressees, asking President Aristide 
to reconsider his decision, which he did not do until now. 
  The international community, on its part, is still asking 
for 
the application of the general framework of the Governors Island 
accord, signed in July 1993 by President Aristide and General 
Cedras, who it still recognizes as chief of the Haitian Army and 
a signatory, under that title, of this accord. 
  It also should be recalled that the Miami conference, which 
at first was to deal with the problem of the Haitian refugees, 
has been extended to discuss the general topic of the return to 
democracy, following pressure from the United States, according 
to diplomatic sources. These same sources specify that 
Washington considered as an insult the inclusion of the question 
of the boat people. 
  It is unknown if the other sectors in Haiti invited to the 
conference will attend.

<F P=106> [Interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by </F>
Daniel Martinez Soto; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Martinez] Mr. Minister, your generation was born 
after 1959. What are the differences between the generation 
that produced the process and the generation that inherited it? 
  [Robaina] Rather than talking about different generations -- 
since we are all engaged in a single project -- I would rather 
talk about a continuing generation, a generation that is aware 
of the many things that we have inherited. The project can be 
improved. I believe no one will accept living in a society in 
which everything has already been done. 
  [Martinez] Let us say you belong to a generation that had no 
choice but to accept what the regime said, a generation that was 
raised within the regime, and that today still has to accept it. 
  [Robaina] It is true that when we were born, many questions 
had already been answered; I feel sincerely grateful for this. 
I believe my entire generation agrees. I believe that, after 
34 years, some answers must be updated, and that this updating 
should be done by all those who have an opinion. We have to 
answer new questions, and no one wants to be outside the design 
of the answers. 
  [Martinez] To make things clearer, are you and your 
generation part of the sector that still defends this process? 
  [Robaina] We share what has already been accomplished and 
what must be preserved at any cost. Some things must be 
modified to preserve the achievements that we deem essential. 
There are also many things that still have to be accomplished, 
a task in which everyone has a chance to participate. 
  [Martinez] Tell us about your position. How would you define 
Cuba's situation today? South Americans think it is complex. 
  [Robaina] It is complex not just for South Americans but for 
the entire world. The situation is complex. I do not like to 
make promises or talk about nonexisting prospects. The Cuban 
situation is very complex because it is not just a matter of 
salvaging or not salvaging. The problem is how to salvage the 
project we are fighting for in the midst of so many pressures 
and harassments. 
  [Martinez] It is obvious that you are speaking about the 
U.S. 
blockade. The question is: Do you think the blockade is the 
sole cause of Cuban problems? 
  [Robaina] No one can have any doubt that it is the single 
most important cause of all our difficulties. But to say that 
the blockade is the only cause of our problems would be untrue. 
The blockade is relative to the new situation, because with the 
resources we now have it is much more difficult to achieve what 
we would like to achieve regarding trade, exchange, and other 
things. We must also admit that a group of solutions in the 
purely economic field have not yielded good results. They did 
not produce the required results. There is a combination of 
many things, without doubt. 
  [Martinez] Among the many mistaken economic factors it is 
almost impossible to omit Cuba's absolute link with the former 
Soviet Union... 
  [Robaina] Without doubt. We paid a dear price for copying 
from them mechanisms that had nothing to do with our 
idiosyncrasy, our culture, or our traditions. But in order to 
fully understand this point we must not forget the blockade or 
our own problems. 
  [Martinez] I would prefer to continue to talk about the 
former Soviet Union. Do you accept that the link established at 
that time was a mistake? 
  [Robaina] There are many things that benefited us, and we 
cannot cover the sun with one finger. There are many things for 
which our people must be grateful to those who helped us save 
the project. The fact that the Cuban project is still alive is 
proof that we did not produce a mechanical copy. For the past 
four or five years the entire world has been thinking that it is 
Cuba's turn to fall because the world surrounding the USSR has 
already collapsed. We must change and adapt, but the single 
fact that we exist is proof that Cuba is not the same thing. 
Countries that made an exact and mechanical copy of the old 
system collapsed with it. 
  [Martinez] Yet while accepting it was a general 
mistake...there seems to be an inclination to establish a 
similar link with Beijing. 
  [Robaina] Our project started to lose the moment we moved 
away from our own reality. Today we are happy to be much closer 
to our roots. We are not going to stumble twice at the same 
hurdle. I do not think we should copy anything. 
  [Martinez] Let us now talk about domestic issues. There is 
an excess of money in the streets, a flourishing black market, 
and dollarization is obvious everywhere. 
  [Robaina] The most important thing is how to defend our 
project. There is a very difficult and complex situation out 
there. We must fight the excess of currency. We must face the 
consequences for lifting the penalty on the use of hard 
currency. In any other part of the world the situation would 
have been confronted with neoliberal measures, where the 
people's opinion does not count. We do not want to act that way. 
  [Martinez] But sometime you will have to act... 
  [Robaina] These are new things for us. For 35 years we have 
been engaged in other measures and another project. I think no 
one, not even our people, would forgive us if we decided to 
implement measures to solve the economic deficit at the cost of 
imposing sacrifice on the people. 
  [Martinez] You talk about sacrifice for the people. By the 
way, there are continuous rumors in Havana that sacrifice is 
imposed on the common people while political and military 
leaders live without any scarcities or without making any 
sacrifices... and there are even stronger rumors that some 
people live better every day in Cuba, but they are not the ones 
who walk the streets... 
  [Robaina] There is no doubt that during any difficult moment 
for any people -- not just due to the internal situation, but 
also due to foreign hostility -- people sow all types of 
discord. We are convinced that if anything has characterized 
our leaderships, it is the manner in which they live, suffer, 
and share the people's needs. It is true that some people took 
advantage of certain circumstances and that there were cases of 
corruption and privileges. When that happened there was an 
immediate and strong response, and the whole world is aware of 
the measures adopted. Today, as ever, we must share 
responsibilities and sacrifices. 
  [Martinez] It is difficult to understand how, in the midst 
of 
gasoline rationing, the streets are shared by new, very 
powerful, gasoline-consuming official vehicles and thousands of 
bicycles... 
  [Robaina] Cheap egalitarianism does not lead anywhere. If 
the decisions that are to be made are made at the speed of a 
bicycle we will never leave a period that we must leave. 
  [Martinez Soto] What are the prospects for better relations 
with the United States, a vital issue for the end of the 20th 
century? 
  [Robaina] I do not see reasons for an excess of enthusiasm. 
I think the only motivation is that the current administration 
does not use the same aggressive language as previous 
administrations. And that is something. This alone will not 
solve the problem; just because there is no aggressive language 
it does not mean the blockade has not been intensified. The 
problem here is one of mutual respect --not just with the United 
States but with anyone -- for the establishment of normal 
relations. We will not sit at a negotiating table as 
subordinates. We believe, however, that there are positive 
talks. There are joint actions against drug trafficking, there 
are contacts among coast guards, and there are talks on a 
telecommunications deal. We can agree that neither Latin 
America nor Cuba are priorities in U.S. foreign policy. The 
current administration is already thinking about the possibility 
of reelection and the Cuban issue is very complicated for its 
domestic policy because it can jeopardize some votes. 
Unfortunately that is the situation. 
  [Martinez] Finally, an aspect that refers to Uruguay as a 
Latin American nation. Cuba played an essential role in 
supporting guerrilla movements that developed against our 
democracies. Today, although that period has ended, what 
guarantees are there for present governments that Cuba will no 
longer intervene? 
  [Robaina] Things happen at a given time and in response to a 
given moment. I am certain that today there are conditions in 
many countries of the continent, through negotiations and 
officially established channels, to enable all movements to 
express themselves. Cuba is not currently working, because that 
system does not work now, on anything to stimulate situations 
that might worry anyone. I think everyone knows to what extent 
true peace exists and to what extent we maintain it through the 
channels which are increasingly being imposed in our current 
times: negotiation, participation, and discussion. America is 
experiencing that process and Cuba is participating, above 
everything else. 
  [Martinez] What are your projections for Cuban foreign 
policy 
in 1994? 
  [Robaina] I think we cannot theorize very much here. 
Projections must be based on a future of much work. The Foreign 
Ministry's objective, today, is to take to the world the image 
of our project. I do not want to give merely a good image -- I 
want to give the real Cuban image, with its good, average, and 
bad things. I do not want to be placed on the defendant's seat 
in court where every opinion will be heard except ours. Cuba 
must not go to the world just to answer questions; it also has 
many questions to ask.

  [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro attended the 
ceremony for the signing of a bilateral cooperation agreement 
between Cuba and Colombia. It was signed by the public health 
ministers of the two countries, Julio Teja and Juan Luis Londono. 
  Fidel briefed the Colombian minister on the characteristics 
of the family doctor program, its origins, and the important 
role it plays in the community. Fidel further pointed out the 
program's contribution in reducing the infant mortality rate to 
9.4 in 1993. He spoke of the training of specialists in general 
medicine, the elevated level of professionalism attained by the 
nurses, and the creation of medical science departments 
throughout the country. 
  The agreement includes prioritized areas such as primary 
attention, epidemiologic surveillance, human resource training, 
essential and generic medicines, and vaccinations.

  [Text] The motor vessel (Brothers) has arrived in port in 
Cuba after a 15-month voyage, during which time its crew bravely 
confronted a seige by officials of the International Transport 
Workers Federation, ITF, who tried to manipulate our sailors, 
making them out to be demanding salaries and other such things. 
The incident occurred in the Norwegian port of (Aldratagen), 
where the (Brothers) arrived carrying a shipment of aluminum 
powder for a factory located there. For several days, they were 
beseiged by the gentlemen from the ITF, who tried to make the 
Cubans out to be strikers demanding salaries. The staunch unity 
of the vessel's 28 crew members and their powerful response was 
not long in coming, and by means of placards and statements to 
the press and to television -- means that were also used by the 
ITF people to coerce them -- the Cubans denied the fib. 
  The (Brothers) returned victorious, and is now in the port 
of 
Cienfuegos unloading 22,000 tons of rice from Indonesia. There 
we spoke with officers and crew members as well as with the 
vessel's captain, Rogelio Rivero, who gave us this information 
for the National Radio Newscast.

  [Text] Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings today 
expressed his appreciation for Cuba's cooperation with Ghana and 
sent a message of solidarity to the people of Cuba. President 
Rawlings received Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina at the 
Presidential Palace. During the meeting, Rawlings said that his 
government still has much to do for Cuba because we must, in 
some way, thank Cuba for what it has done for Africa. Ghana has 
never hidden its appreciation for all that the Cuban Government 
has done for us, President Rawlings told Foreign Minister 
Robaina who has just concluded a two-day visit to Ghana. The 
Ghanaian president also expressed his appreciation to the Cuban 
authorities for sending a medical brigade to help control an 
outbreak of Buruli ulcer. Rawlings also expressed his 
willingness to develop bilateral cooperation in the field of 
health. 
  At the conclusion of his two-day trip to Accra, Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina thanked Ghana for its support of the 
island at international fora, particularly at the United 
Nations. The head of Cuban diplomacy also thanked Ghana for its 
position on issues such as the economic blockade imposed by the 
U.S. Government more than 30 years ago. After describing 1993 
as the most difficult year for the Cuban Revolution, Robaina 
predicted that 1994 will represent the beginning of an ascending 
curve for his people. Robaina said that among Cuba's foreign 
policy priorities are the democratization of the United Nations 
and the strengthening of the role played by the nonaligned 
countries.

  [Text] Last night, the workers movement of Pinar del Rio 
Province began the analysis process for restructuring of the 
national economy. The meeting was held at La Primavera preserves 
factory in the provincial capital. The assembly was chaired by 
Politburo member Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban 
Workers Federation [CTC], who said that these issues would be 
analyzed throughout the month of January by the country's more 
than 485,000 labor union leaders, and later by the workers, 
although in some collectives, the analyses would be done 
simultaneously. 
  Ross pointed out that even though certain procedures were 
bothersome at first, they were necessary for everyone's 
well-being and for the future. The labor union leader said that 
with this meeting, held at the factory in Pinar del Rio, they 
were beginning a consultation process to fight this new battle 
together.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Cuban economic developments monitored through 11 
January 1994. Source is cited in parentheses following item. 
  The tourism sector, considered one of the keys to changing 
the current Cuban crisis, grossed approximately $700 million in 
revenues in 1993, which represents approximately one-half of the 
net income. Tourism is the only sector of the Cuban economy that 
reached sustained annual growth rates surpassing 25 percent in 
the 1990's. In 1991, 366,000 tourists visited the island. In 
1992, this figure rose to 490,000 and to approximately 600,000 
in 1993. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0008 GMT 5 Jan 94)

  [Text] With support from 24 advisors from the PRC, the 
first five low-voltage electric motors have been produced. These 
motors constitute a successful test prior to the adjustment 
phase of the factory that is being built in Cacocum, Holguin 
Province, with PRC cooperation. 
  The new electric motor factory is scheduled to begin 
operations during the first quarter of 1994. It is 72-percent 
complete, and its 120 basic machine tools are already installed. 
The first of these factories of moderate technological 
complexity in the country has the means necessary to annually 
produce 30,000 top-quality triphasic and monophasic motors of 23 
types, motors that will fulfill vital requirements in such 
economic sectors as the sugar and the nickel industries. The 
factory also opens horizons for exports and for penetration into 
the home electrical appliance field in Cuba.

  [Text] In Pinar del Rio Province, Cuban Workers Federation 
Secretary General Pedro Ross Leal called the consultations with 
workers and union leaders held at the establishment known as La 
Primavera and at the dried tobacco processing center in the 
nation's westernmost province a worthy beginning to the process 
of holding assemblies that will take place throughout Cuba. 
Journalist Cabrera Peinado has further details from Pinar del 
Rio. 
  [Cabrera Peinado] Through 28 January some 400,000 union 
leaders in Cuba will be preparing, holding discussions and 
making proposals with regard to the measures the Revolution's 
leadership will have to adopt to streamline internal finances; 
and as of 28 January, meetings with all Cuban workers will be 
held. Many proposals were made openly and without formalities at 
the meetings held at La Primavera and at the dried tobacco 
processing center. Among these proposals was that the monitoring 
and safekeeping of state resources be improved, so that these 
resources will not be squandered or end up in the hands of 
antisocial elements. Also, in these assemblies taking place in 
Cuba, the residents of Pinar del Rio Province came out in favor 
of finding ways to reduce to a minimum the amount of currency 
circulating -- which is affecting the nation and, in particular, 
the workers, because of the high prices of products on the black 
market. They also came out in favor of increasing the nation's 
production levels and improving the efficiency of enterprises. 
They noted the need to raise certain prices, such as those of 
cigarrettes, alcoholic beverages, and other products which, even 
though they may be articles of prime necessity, should cost what 
it costs to produce them. They also came out in favor of 
subsidizing people who need a subsidy. 
  It was also said that there exist a number of services which 
could perfectly well be charged for, such as admission to sports 
and cultural events and students' clothing and books, as well as 
cosmetic surgery and other health procedures that are not 
indispensable to life. 
  Pedro Ross Leal said that our fatherland is urgently in need 
of a battle for economic efficiency, and, more than anything 
else, needs to find solutions to current problems. He added that 
the nation cannot allow itself the luxury of continuing to have 
69 percent of its enterprises be unprofitable, for in addition 
to what is invested in health and education, 1.6 billion pesos 
are paid out in social insurance and welfare annually. 
  [Begin Ross recording] And what the nation wants, what the 
leadership of the Revolution wants, and what we as a union 
movement have to do is to encourage the workers, as owners, and 
in the final analysis as the principal organizations in our 
society, to play the part that befits them. [end recording]

  [Text] [First announcer] Jose Antonio (de la Osa) today 
published an article in GRANMA on AIDS, which as you all know is 
the disease of the century. The article is entitled, 
"Irresponsible Sexual Conduct is Suicidal." It contains very 
precise data, which I find very interesting and which you should 
know about. 
  According to this article, the AIDS prevention and control 
program that the Ministry of Public Health has successfully been 
carrying out has made it possible to, up to the end of 1993, 
diagnose 988 patients in Cuba as HIV-positive. Of these, 236 
have fallen ill, and, as of 31 December 1993, 148 had died. 
  During 1993, 102 seropositive individuals were detected, 
from 
the close to 2 million test results examined, tests made with 
reagents produced by Cuba's pharmaceutical industry. There are 
more details. Let's see what Dr. (Manuel Santin Pena) said. He 
is the national director for epidemiology of the Ministry of 
Public Health. Eddy? 
  [Announcer identified only as "Eddy"] Well, he said that the 
blood banks are well monitored; it is therefore not possible in 
Cuba to catch the disease of the century through blood 
transfusions. Practically the only way to contract the virus in 
our environment is therefore through sex, which makes it 
dependent on an individual's sense of responsibility and conduct 
in selecting a partner and using condoms properly. 
  Dr. (Santin) commented: Irresponsible conduct is quite 
simply 
suicidal. He also said that the prevention program is in the 
process of being perfected. According to (Santin), sanatorium 
care will continue to be made more flexible. 
  In the last few years, those seropositive individuals who 
have become more aware regarding their illness are being offered 
facilities to allow them to live within the society and within 
their families. The experience gained now permits us to begin 
the system of outpatient care, which can be extended to all 
seropositive people who take a responsibile attitude toward the 
family and the society and who, moreover, voluntarily request 
such care. The Ministry of Public Health will maintain 
sanatorium care, which will continue to play an important role 
in the program against AIDS, while at the same time trying to 
reach out further into the community. Care of the seropositive 
will be the responsibility of the Family Doctor Program 
physicians, and they will, through interconsultations, receive 
the specialized care they require including, free, the specific 
medications required by their condition as carriers of the AIDS 
virus. 
  It is important to remember that the AIDS virus dies quickly 
once outside the human body. This explains why casual contact 
does not provide a vehicle for the transmission of AIDS. Can 
AIDS be transmitted by a kiss on the mouth? It is true that the 
virus has been found in saliva, and in tears. This discovery, 
logically, provoked concern, but the truth of the matter is that 
in order to transmit the disease by mouth, the virus would have 
to make direct contact with the circulating blood. Up to the 
present, there has not been a single report of anyone's having 
contracted AIDS from a kiss on the mouth. Neither are there any 
reports of people having become infected through common use of a 
glass, flatware, or bed linens. 
  This has been an article carried in the newspaper GRANMA 
today and signed by comrade Jose Antonio (de la Osa), entitled: 
"In Connection With the Disease of the Century: Irresponsible 
Sexual Behavior is Suicidal."

<F P=106> [Part one of "nonbroadcast portion" of interview with </F>
Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National Assembly 
of the People's Government, ANPP, by reporters Julio Batista and 
Rosa Maria Godoy on the "I Have An Opinion" program, on 10 
January in Havana -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Godoy] All during this interview you have stressed 
base-level work, the work of the People's Government in the 
municipalities, provinces, and People's Councils which are 
currently the newest body of government. I want to know your 
opinion on the present development of the People's Councils in 
Cuba in terms of problem solving at each locality, each province. 
  [Alarcon] I believe the People's Councils in general are 
attaining highly positive results. They also are becoming a 
path, a strategy -- that of the people's participation; the 
people's participation in the search for solutions to their own 
problems; the people's participation in the real and full 
exercise of the government which can only be achieved at the 
base level. 
  I believe that many and diverse initiatives and experiences 
exist, depending on the place, the nature of the situation, and 
the characteristics of the region. It is more evident each day 
that the People's Council is an effective instrument of 
government from the base, of control over the administration, 
resources, and the entire effort which the nation has to 
conduct. It also is an effective tool to stimulate the insertion 
of the people into the activities of the people's government, 
the activities of the nation and government of our country. I am 
not saying that we have reached the final alternative. We are 
making progress. We have to insist that the People's Councils 
have to conduct all their activities keeping this essential 
strategy in mind. Their essential strategy is to channel the 
people's initiatives, channel the masses's work from the base in 
order to exert a positive control on the entire society; also, 
to stimulate, develop, and strengthen all the creative potential 
of our people toward the solution of the problems we confront 
today. 
  [Batista] However, does a People's Council at the base have 
the conditions to undertake these responsibilities, these tasks 
we are saying they have to pursue? 
  [Alarcon] Through the people. If we were to see the People's 
Councils work as the endeavor of its presidents, we would be 
asking too much from those comrades. The People's Council 
president is nothing more than a district delegate elected by 
other delegates as their president. In Havana itself, I have 
seen several experiences during progress report meetings in 
which I have participated where the neighbors, many times at the 
suggestion of the president of the People's Council, have 
established work committees or groups; neighbors who form a 
health committee, an education committee, a committee to oversee 
food or services issues, etc. 
  In other words, the president of the People's Council has 
the 
support, the real participation of voters, of citizens who help 
in performing these tasks. It would be impossible for a single 
person to truly discharge these responsibilities. He has a basic 
responsibility, that of guiding, that of exerting his authority 
as an elected official of the voters, and of the delegates as 
president of the People's Council. In the measure that he 
manages to insert the people, the neighbors on a daily, real, 
and practical basis, he can fulfill these tasks. No one knows 
all the things we might yet do, in the measure that the people 
truly undertake this method of government as their own. 
  This is something we have to understand. It is very new: the 
true conduit of democracy. Democracy is the authority of the 
people. True democracy is that which promotes, in the measure 
possible, more and more each day, the direct participation of 
the people in their government. We can do this, first of all, 
because we have a social system based on equity, human 
solidarity, and human fraternity. These are the goals and 
ethical ideals of our social system -- a society free of 
exploitation, free of the rule of a minority over the majority 
of the people. Therefore, we have the social base to develop 
these forms of participation in the management of the society. 
This is not achieved overnight. 
  Earlier, we discussed financial issues. These are complex 
and difficult issues but in the measure that we progress and 
study, we can manage and understand these problems better. There 
are many other things that can be done on the basis of this 
essential principle. This is not a case of the people and the 
government working apart, not a case of the people and the state 
working apart. Our system, not by chance, is called a people's 
government. It will have authority and be powerful and effective 
in the measure it is truly of the people. It is of the people 
due to its political character, due to what it seeks, because it 
works for the benefit of the people. However, we have to make it 
more of the people through the real participation of the people 
in the system. 
  [Batista] Regarding your answer, I wanted to express my 
opinion because there are truly many people who believe that the 
people's government, as an institution, does not solve many 
problems at the base. Therefore, perhaps all this has to do with 
the mechanisms, or problems with resources, or, at times, a 
matter of method, or that the government mechanisms are not 
understood in terms of public health or education. This is why I 
was asking this type of question regarding the operations, 
mechanisms, solutions, resources, and possibilities of the 
government in each region to solve and confront the problems. 
  [Alarcon] There are problems in our national reality that do 
not have solutions today, for example, everything related to 
material resources. However, there is another dimension to this 
problem, that which sees the people on one side and their 
representatives on the other. This has to do with the concept we 
have of progress report meetings. There was a period in which, 
to a certain measure -- I do not want to generalize, it was not 
the same everywhere -- it was an occasion for the voters to make 
their suggestions, to express their complaints to the delegate 
and then wait for an answer from that delegate. On more than one 
occasion, when ones analyses a good part of the problems brought 
up at the base, you realize that the problems do not relate to 
efforts the delegates have to make at higher levels, but to 
issues that can be solved by the people themselves. This is a 
right of the people -- that of organizing and acting, of taking 
their initiatives and channelling their collective efforts. 
  The role of the delegates ought to be that of directing the 
pertinent effort to solve everything possible at that level. We 
have to abandon that passive attitude, that view of the voters 
as passive objects. We have to see the voter as the subject, the 
main subject of our system of government. When you see 
yourselves in that manner, when we see ourselves collectively in 
that manner, we find that some of the issues brought to the 
delegates to be solved by them, can be solved or improved by us. 
I am not saying that is the case in every instance. Of course, 
there are daily problems we all face related to the shortages of 
resources. However, how many difficulties are born in our minds, 
how many limitations have to do with our passivity, our refusal 
to be creative. 
  This is a system whose main goal ought to be the development 
of the creative potential of the masses. It is a system which 
deep down is based on something Fidel has said many times, about 
turning the trust in the people, in their values, pride, and 
will into a concrete political and daily phenomenon. This is the 
essence of the work of the people's government at the base, and 
from the base up through the entire system. 
  [Batista] What also happens is that I have seen government 
bodies that do not give any support or help to the municipal 
delegates. I believe this affects the prestige of that 
individual and the possibilities for the people to trust him, 
because one is trusted in the measure that one solves or gives 
appropriate answers. Otherwise, what one says is not believed. 
  [Alarcon] That is true. Unfortunately, this is one reality 
our delegates have to confront, particularly in certain places. 
I would say this exists more so in big cities than in small 
communities. This is why we see such rich experiences in certain 
People's Councils which are not attained in places where the 
delegates confront more complex situations. I also believe that 
this is part of the necessary struggle that the entire system 
must confront, not only the delegate and the base. This is why 
the People's Council becomes a support system for that delegate. 
A higher level, the municipal assembly, must also play an active 
role, and so does the National Assembly. However, the people 
must also do so. 
  The delegate might find perhaps misunderstanding, 
bureaucratic red tape, inertia, or lack of care, but those 
people must know that the delegate is truly working for the 
people. 
  [Batista] Alarcon, there have also been cases of delegates 
who have been dismissed by the voters for shortcomings or poor 
performance? 
  [Alarcon] I believe so. I know of some cases in which, 
perhaps due to shortcomings or other criteria, the delegate also 
believes he is not up to the task and asks to be replaced. There 
have been changes in the people's government at the base. I know 
of some even at the municipal level. I believe we should see 
this as a very healthy sign, a very natural thing which should 
not be seen in critical terms or as chaos. I believe is it only 
natural. They are representatives of the people, people from 
among the people, and it might happen that sometimes their 
possibilities become exhausted or they reach the limit of their 
capabilities. The people must exert their right to elect another 
individual. I believe this is one of the virtues of our system. 
Much is said abroad about great democratic systems where the 
people have the worst opinion of a an elected deputy and yet 
have to wait four or six years to elect another demagogue. 
  This is why it is so important that several principles be 
fully implemented in our system: close ties between the voter 
and those elected -- provincial and base- level delegates; and 
periodic progress reports. The essential part of both mechanisms 
is to make people feel increasingly they are part of the system, 
rather than feeling foreign to it. The system is not foreign to 
the people. On the contrary, the people are an integral part of 
the people's government system.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Jan (NA) -- Deputy Foreign Minister 
Eduardo Petrella today denied the existence of official 
information on the presence of Argentine guerrillas in the 
National Zapatist Liberation Army (EZLN) in the State of 
Chiapas, Mexico. 
  He thus denied a report published today in a Buenos Aires 
daily which states that "Argentine citizens, who formally 
belonged to the People's Revolutionary Army, are in prominent 
EZLN posts." 
  This information, the newspaper article states, "allegedly 
became available last week in Buenos Aires though secret reports 
prepared by the Mexican Government." 
  According to the article, President Carlos Menem allegedly 
personally referred to the issue when he denounced the existence 
of "subversive mercenaries" in the revolt in the State of 
Chiapas. 
  In statements to a radio station, Petrella said: "We have no 
information" about Argentine guerrillas in Chiapas. 
  The deputy foreign minister said: "Our embassy keeps us 
permanently informed about these things," adding that the 
Mexican problem cannot be "extrapolated" to Argentina. 
  He added that he knows nothing about a possible meeting at a 
continental level to discuss the Mexican problem. The OAS has 
not made any "collective suggestion" on the subject, he said .

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Jan (NA) -- Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo warned today that "there is a breeding ground 
for guerrilla actions in the provinces where no progress has 
been made on economic changes." He added that the "faults in 
the security mechanisms" are to blame for the recent incidents 
in Santiago del Estero. 
  Cavallo said that the provinces that joined the federal 
fiscal pact must extend the elimination of taxes on gross 
income, and concentrate on tax collections on wholesale and 
retail business where "there is still a great deal of tax 
evasion." 
  Cavallo then referred to the guerrilla actions in Mexico, 
saying that "the Central American guerrilla organizations were 
able to operate in Mexico due to faults in the security system 
which did not prevent an attack on cities." 
  Cavallo also denied that the Economy and Interior Ministries 
would concentrate in their hands the government's social 
spending, while admitting that coordinated action would be 
carried out to discover "what part of the spending each ministry 
does." 
  Cavallo also confirmed that the government "will not retreat 
on the reduction in employers' contributions," but indicated 
that the collection for social projects and for the PAMI 
[Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan] will not be reduced -- 
rather, "to the contrary." 
  He added: "There will be no losses. The collection for 
social projects will be either maintained or increased." 
  Cavallo made these comments today during a news conference 
to 
discuss various current economic and political issues. 
  He first referred to the strike called by the CGT [General 
Confederation of Labor], saying that the measure is within 
"constitutional rights, but there is no reason to do it; it will 
not be useful." 
  Cavallo said that what caused the strike was the decision to 
reduce employers' contributions, which is a decision that 
"should not have surprised anyone, because we always said we 
were going to reduce them." 
  "Social projects will not lose one cent," said Cavallo in a 
direct message to the union. He added: "The collection for 
social projects will be increased with relation to 1993." 
  He admitted, however, that "there may be some problems in 
redistribution." He added: "This is what the National 
Administration for Health Insurance is for." 
  Cavallo indicated that the contributions' reduction will 
represent "greater production, lower prices, investments, and 
new sources of work." 
  Regarding the government's alleged persecution of unions, 
Cavallo said: "The operations of the DGI [General Directorate 
of Taxation] began in October-November, and not when the 
reduction in the contribution was decided." 
  Regarding politics, Cavallo agreed with presenting a single 
list for the election of constituent members in Cordoba Province. 
  In answer to a specific question on this issue, Cavallo 
said: 
"The technical answer is that it seems to me that the single 
list is a very good thing, because there would be more 
constituent members from the Justicialist Party and the UCD 
[Democratic Center Union] than from the Radical Civic Union." 
  Cavallo added: "If the Radicals have a majority, they would 
obstruct the economic process because their only chance to win 
the elections is if the economic program fails." 
  He added: "If there is a confrontation I might consider the 
possibility of becoming a candidate for the Constituent 
Assembly, but if the results of 3 October 1993 are reflected I 
will be quite satisfied."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 11 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  The Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development has 
imposed a 323-percent tax on the importation of shoes from 
China. This concludes the investigation into unfair trade 
practices in China, which determined dumping practices were in 
effect. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 1624 GMT 5 
Jan 94) 
  According to the Mexican Association of Banks, discount 
rates 
on businesses affiliated to credit charge companies have been 
reduced. The discounts will be based on the annual sales of 
establishments and credit card sales amounts. Those 
establishments with higher sales will be benefited the most. 
Commercial establishments with annual sales of over 300,000 new 
pesos will pay a 2.25 percent rate, on condition that average 
sales amount to more than 500 new pesos. (Mexico City Radio ACIR 
Network in Spanish 0200 GMT 6 Jan 94) 
  The agreements Mexico signed with the United States and 
Germany to avoid double taxation on income taxes went into 
effect on 1 January, the Secretariat of Credit and Public 
Finance has reported. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in 
Spanish 0430 GMT 6 Jan 94) 
  The Central Bank of Mexico reported on 9 January that Mexico 
registered an 8-percent inflation rate in 1993. This is the 
first time in more than 20 years that the inflation rate in 
Mexico is a one-digit figure. According to the Bank of Mexico, 
inflation totalled 11.9 percent in 1992, 18.8 percent in 1991, 
and 29.9 percent in 1990. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 0058 GMT 10 
Jan 94) 
  The Bank of Mexico has reported that 1994 began with good 
prospects for economic growth in Mexico. The slowdown in the 
United States, Mexico's main trading partner, has ended. 
Therefore, Mexican exports are expected to increase. Interest 
rates have recently declined, thereby promoting a greater level 
of economic activity. In sum, national finances are clean 
following the problems in the 1980's. The public debt only 
represents 32 percent of GDP. (Mexico City Canal 13 Television 
Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 11 Jan 94)

in the last four years. The main indicator pertaining to stock 
exchange transactions dropped 165.92 points, 6.3 percent, to 
close the day at 2459.52. Stock market analysts have said the 
atmosphere of uncertainty in our country as a result of the 
conflict in Chiapas has caused the drop in the stock market. 
They have warned about the possibility of a flight of capital 
and investments if the conflict prolongs or extends to other 
regions of the country.

  [Text] Mexico City, 10 Jan (EFE) -- Eloy Cantu, official 
Mexican Government spokesman on the Chiapas conflict, said the 
armed uprising of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) 
is intended to cloud and block the development of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
  In statements published today by the Mexican newspapers 
REFORMA and EL NORTE, Cantu indicated that the rebels seek to 
internationally discredit President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's. 
He said the rebels want to prevent free trade, the creation of 
jobs, the increase of foreign investments, economic growth, and 
wage increases in Mexico, objectives that NAFTA seeks. 
  "It is obvious that it is not an Indian insurgent movement, 
because if it were, they would be using machetes. This armed 
group would not have been repudiated as it has," he added.

<F P=106> [From the "Panorama" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN] have released a five-point proposal to begin a dialogue 
with the government. They are demanding the recognition of the 
EZLN as a belligerent force, a cease-fire by both parties, the 
Army's withdrawal from all the communities--with a full respect 
for human rights--and the suspension of the indiscriminate 
bombardment of rural towns. 
  In the communique, in which it discloses this proposal, the 
EZLN says that it does not have in its ranks or its leadership 
any foreigner nor has it ever received any support or advice 
from revolutionary movements of other countries or foreign 
governments. 
  We have a report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal 
de 
las Casas: 
  [Santoyo] The EZLN has issued its first official communique 
describing as unacceptable the federal government's conditions 
for a dialogue. It added that it will put down its weapons when 
its demands are fully met. 
  In the five-page document delivered to the newspaper EL 
TIEMPO of San Cristobal de las Casas, the EZLN establishes five 
points that must be followed to begin a dialogue: 
  1. The recognition of the EZLN as a belligerent force. 
  2. A cease-fire by both parties throughout the territory 
involved in the conflict. 
  3. The withdrawal of federal troops from all the 
communities, with a full respect for the human rights of the 
rural population and the return of federal troops to their 
respective garrisons in the different places of the country. 
  4. The suspension of the bombardment of rural towns. 
  5. Based on the compliance with the previous conditions, the 
EZLN is proposing the creation of a national commission for 
intermediation [intermediacion]. 
  The EZLN adds that its troops vow to respect these 
conditions 
if the federal government does likewise; otherwise, it warns, 
the EZLN will continue its military actions in the various 
regions. 
  It says that it will abide by the laws of war as approved by 
the Geneva Convention, respecting the civilian population, the 
Red Cross, the media, the wounded, and the enemy troops that 
surrender without a fight. 
  Furthermore, in six points, it explains the reason for its 
struggle and the reason to clarify various matters regarding the 
EZLN movement. First, it says that it has no foreigners in its 
ranks or among its leadership. Second, it also denies that it 
has any ties or links with Catholic religious authorities or of 
any other denomination. 
  A third point stresses that its ranks consist of Chiapas 
Indians who are the most humiliated and unprotected people in 
Mexico. 
  In the fourth point, the EZLN admits that it has 
sophisticated modern weapons and communications equipment which, 
it explains, were acquired by contributions from civilians. 
  A fifth point notes that this struggle was started because 
throughout 10 years they resorted to every peaceful and legal 
means to solve their problems. The sixth point lists the 
conditions for dialogue. 
  The subversive group also assesses the situation. It states 
that nine EZLN members were killed and another 20 were seriously 
wounded. It adds that the enemy casualties, including policemen 
and federal soldiers, amount to 27 dead, 40 wounded, and 180 
prisoners who were already released. It also says that during 
the attacks against four jails, they released 200 inmates. 
  This first EZLN official communique was signed with an 
explanation handwritten by subcommander Marcos and states that 
it was issued somewhere in Mexico's southwestern mountains. 
  For its part, the special commission for the dialogue of 
Chiapas' social sectors, which consists of Senator Eduardo 
Robledo Rincon, Heraclio Cepeda, and (Andres Falgas Quic), 
stated that if they are asked to form a negotiating commission 
with the rebel forces, they will be glad to participate. 
  Meanwhile, Senator Robledo Rincon has made the following 
announcement: 
  [Begin Robledo Rincon recording] We have been talking with 
different organizations and parties, and they have expressed 
their concern for their rank and file. We were allowed to 
permit several leaders of these organizations and 
representatives of relatives, as well as government officials, 
to tour parts of the region, especially the Ocosingo area, so 
that they can establish contacts in the different regions of the 
state. [end recording] 
  [Santoyo] At the same time, the National Human Rights 
Commission has reported that members of its delegation, which 
consists of lawyers and doctors, has visited Altamirano and 
Chanal, where there had been heavy fighting. They have said 
they went to San Carlos Hospital and Santo Domingo Convent, 
where they have received complaints of alleged violations of 
human rights. Different townspeople have filed the complaints, 
complaints, they said, which are being investigated.

<F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Pena from Tuxtla Gutierrez; from the </F>
"Upon Awakening" newscast] 
  [Text] Forty of the 100 individuals who were held against 
their will by rebel groups in Guadalupe Tepeyac, Las Margaritas 
Municipality, arrived early this morning. These individuals 
arrived yesterday [as heard] from that area, after they were 
released; in addition, 60 others who were held hostage at the 
Social Security Hospital in that area were also released. They 
all said they were held against their will. Relatives of the 
doctors and nurses who could not leave the town since 30 
December were also accompanying them. 
  Apparently, that area is still under rebel control. It is 
expected that the situation here will be normalized very soon, 
within a few hours or days, as the rebels will withdraw to the 
highlands in Chiapas.

  [Text] The government of Mexico City and the Assembly of 
Representatives have issued a joint statement condemning the 
acts of violence and attempts of sabotage during recent days in 
Mexico City and around Mexico State. The communique by the 
local government and representatives of the people came a few 
hours after Mexico City Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez and assembly 
members held a closed-door meeting at the central department's 
headquarters, where security measures have been increased via 
careful searches of citizens at the building's main access 
points. During the meeting, which was preceded over by a 
meeting attended by Protection and Highways Secretary Rene 
Monterrubio and chiefs of that group, the government of Mexico 
City and the representatives agreed on the following measures: 
  1. The Federal District Department will hold periodic 
meetings with the Assembly of Representatives to keep the 
assembly members abreast of the situation in the city. 
  2. The meetings of the Precinct Councils for Public Security 
and Civil Protection will be increased, and the regulations on 
the matter issued by the assembly will be strictly enforced. 
  3. A representative of the local government will be named to 
establish a timetable of periodic meetings with the 
representatives, mainly with the members of the Public Security 
and Justice Committees. 
  4. All of the city's police units, including the Bengala 
Group, will continue to perform strictly preventive functions, 
as has been reaffirmed. The Mexico City Attorney General's 
Office--which is headed temporarily by Rene Gonzalez de la Vega 
starting today--will be in charge of investigations. 
  5. The public is urged again to report to city police units 
vehicle thefts and the presence of abandoned cars or armed 
individuals in the streets, in addition to filing the 
appropriate complaints. 
  6. The appropriate measures will be expedited to install 
this week the 08 police hotline number to the remainder of the 
city's areas; this system was extended on 10 January to the 
Precincts of Alvaro Obregon, Tlalpan, and Magdalena Contreras. 
  7. The need was established for all of the patrols of the 
General Secretariat of Protection and Highways, including 
backups, to have the numbers and identification badges assigned 
to them in each of the city's political entities. 
  8. A timetable of meetings between Mexico City 
representatives and the business and commercial sector was 
established so that the latter may expand their own security 
systems in the areas where their buildings are located. 
  9. A surveillance operation will be established to punish 
those who paint graffiti on private buildings or government 
offices during demonstrations of support, which may not be 
linked necessarily to the armed movement, as established by the 
government's rules on civilian justice. At the end of the 
meeting, Amalia Garcia, chairwoman of the Public Security 
Committee of the Assembly of Representatives, said that in 
addition to this agreement, Aguilera pledged before the 
representatives to act at all times within the framework of the 
law and with strict adherence to the people's human, political, 
and civil rights. 
  [Begin Garcia recording] There would never be any 
justification to violate the human and civil rights of Mexico 
City residents; that would be unacceptable. We have also stated 
that the constitutional guarantee to assemble, demonstrate, and 
express one's opinion have to be respected. [end recording]

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, 11 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- 
Witnesses are reporting that an armed group of the self-styled 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) took over for the 
second time Chanal Municipality, southeastern Chiapas State, 
early this morning. 
  A "large" number of EZLN members occupied Chanal, which had 
been retaken by the Mexican Army five days ago. The reports do 
not mention whether there is fighting. Chanal is located 
approximately 50 km east of San Cristobal de las Casas, which is 
located 1,200 km southeast of Mexico City and which was one of 
the municipalities seized by the armed group on 1 January, when 
the conflict began. 
  In a new operation, the Mexican Army is about 75 km from the 
town of Guadalupe Tepeyac, which, according to witnesses, has 
been cut off by armed men who dug five-meter deep trenches 
around it. 
  According to the reports, Guadalupe Tepeyac has been under 
the control of the armed group since 1 January, when the 
conflict began with the violent seizure of towns and an attack 
against a garrison, forcing the Army to intervene. 
  Witnesses say the armed group is preventing people from 
entering or leaving the center of Guadalupe Tepeyac, southeast 
Chiapas, near the Guatemalan border. Approximately 80 workers 
of the public clinic in Guadalupe Tepeyac were released 
yesterday by the armed group and are in Tuxtla Gutierrez, 
capital of Chiapas.

  [Text] The Defense Secretariat issued a communique a few 
minutes ago reporting on the situation in Chiapas for the last 
few hours. The National Defense communique stated that in the 
town of Guadalupe Tepeyac, the transgressors of the law released 
63 workers of the Social Security clinic who had been kidnapped 
when the conflict began in Chiapas. The workers were taken to 
the Comitan de Dominguez Garrison, where they were fed, and then 
they were sent to the capital of Chiapas State. 
  The Defense Secretariat stated that 10 days after operations 
began to reestablish order in the Chiapas highlands, clashes 
between the transgressors of the law and Army troops have 
decreased considerably. It added that from Monday night to 
early morning Tuesday, there have been no clashes; nevertheless, 
troops are continuing to guard several towns that were the 
targets of the armed groups. The bulletin read that in addition 
to the combing operations by the troops, several aircraft are 
overflying the area to detect the groups of transgressors still 
roaming around some towns. According to the communique, it has 
been learned that approximately 50 transgressors abandoned their 
weapons near Palenque and fled to unknown locations.

  [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas, has announced his plans to perform 
his new responsibilities. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] We are all aware of the 
risks that the Chiapas situation entails and of the difficulties 
in restoring conditions for coexistence based on law and justice. 
  Our main concern now is that Mexicans have died. We must 
express our condolences to all families who have lost a dear 
one, but the only way to express this to them and the rest of 
the country is with sincerity--by stopping violence. 
  Today, condemning violence is not enough; the solution is 
ahead. Whoever believes in peace must take positive actions to 
attain it. We must reconstruct the regional political process 
and seek a dignified political solution for all. We will have 
to offer, through actions, a real solution to problems. No one 
wants more deaths or terrorism. 
  The order of the actions we will undertake--considering the 
current situation and the ideas of those who are mostly 
concerned about the conflict in the region--will be: 
  1. To seek as soon as possible a truce to end the 
hostilities and restore peace in the region. 
  2. To seek by all means the initiation of a dialogue that 
will lead to peace and reconciliation, thus opening the 
possibility for Indians to return to their towns and participate 
in changes that must be promoted in the region, considering all 
sectors. I have learned through the media about reports on the 
presumed willingness from the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation 
Army] to establish conditions that can lead to a dialogue. 
Should those reports be confirmed, it would be the first signal 
that could help us find the path toward peace. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Manuel Pereyra; from the "At Noon" newscast] </F>
  [Text] There are more evident signs that the situation is 
going back to normal here in San Cristobal de las Casas. In 
this town, located in the higher area of Chiapas, the troops 
were withdrawn from the main square, but strict vigilance 
continues by the military police, pardon me, the municipal 
police. 
  Last night, after eight days in the dark, street lights were 
turned on. Traffic became normal since then. 
  At noon, the Cardenist National Reconstruction Party began 
its presidential campaign, in the main square, which shows that 
the situation is returning to normal. 
  Candidate Rafael Aguilar Talamante gave a speech expressing 
support for the people of Chiapas. He demanded that the 
struggle against the insurrection should not be used as a 
pretext to fight the true leaders of social struggle. 
  I also want to report that the Special Autonomous Commission 
-- which consists of Senator Eduardo Robledo, writer Heraclio 
Cepeda, and anthropologist Andres Fabrega--is visiting Palenque 
to meet with social organizations seeking channels of 
communications that can lead to a solution for the armed 
conflict being experienced in this region. 
  The commission members will arrive during the afternoon and 
will report on what they accomplished during the day. 
  I also want to inform that Manuel Camacho Solis, the peace 
commissioner appointed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 
is expected in Tuxtla Gutierrez at approximately 1400 and in San 
Cristobal between 1600 and 1700. We will find out about the 
details of his mission when he arrives here. There have been 
reports, however, about it through a news conference that 
Camacho Solis held in Mexico City. 
  To conclude, I must inform you that air patrolling near the 
higher Chiapas region by Mexican Air Force aircraft is constant 
to fight rebels and prevent them from reaching towns. 
  In the meantime, the garrison of the 7th Military Region in 
Rancho Nuevo is still harassed by the guerrillas who are 
executing sporadic attacks there.

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Arturo Fajardo Maldonado has 
alluded to the implication of terrorism unleashed in Guatemala 
linked to the appearance of a guerrilla movement in southern 
Mexico. The foreign minister expressed the Guatemalan 
Government's condemnation for that type of action. 
  [Begin recording] [Fajardo] First, we condemn these actions. 
I think they are regrettable and that such things should not 
happen. We strongly condemn them, mainly because they are 
unnecessary violent actions and above all because it has 
involved a diplomatic mission accredited in Guatemala from a 
brother country for which we have much respect. In this regard, 
I immediately spoke to the government minister last night to 
request protection for the offices of the Mexican diplomatic 
mission, not only for the consulate but for the remainder of the 
offices and the ambassador's residence. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is there a link between what is 
going on in Mexico and the Guatemalan rebels? 
  [Fajardo] I can not state an opinion on that issue, on which 
I have no information. The fact is that those are condemnable 
actions, and we condemn them strongly. 
  We hope, of course, that Mexico, as it appears, will get on 
the path for a dialogue and find solutions in the most 
appropriate way. According to [word indistinct] institutions, 
that is their internal problem. 
  [Reporter] Regarding the summons on Serrano, how is that 
affair developing? 
  [Fajardo] As I told you last week, we have received the file 
sent by the corresponding court through the Supreme Court of 
Justice. The Foreign Ministry's legal department has the file 
now, and they will issue a ruling to determine whether it is 
fulfilling the prerequisites established by our national laws, 
as well as by the standing international agreements on 
extradition between Panama and Guatemala so that there are no 
problems. 
  [Reporter] When will it be sent to Panama? 
  [Fajardo] As soon as we verify that it meets the 
prerequisites. If it does not, we will send the appropriate 
recommendations to the Attorney General's Office and the courts 
so that there is no formality problem. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "Cavallo's </F>
Criticisms"] 
  [Text] Domingo Cavallo has tremendous energy. He takes 
care of Argentine economic policy and still finds time to 
criticize the manner in which Brazilians conduct their own 
business. The Argentine economy minister does not like what he 
sees on this side of the border. For him, Brazil serves as 
example of what must not be done. What are we doing so wrong? 
According to Cavallo, we maintain low salaries and a policy of 
hunger so that surplus production may be exported at any price. 
And that, he guarantees patriotically, Argentina will never do, 
although it might have done so "in times of recession." 
  The Brazilian economic policy is one of Cavallo's favorite 
targets. He never loses an opportunity, and if there is no 
opportunity he creates one. It is an irritating habit which 
would be no more than that had the policy not been a copy of 
ideas or due to subjective evaluations. In this case it is 
difficult to ignore the minister's periodical diatribes, as he 
is the director of economy of our greatest partner in Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South], an undertaking which not only has 
consequences for the performance of some companies, but has 
become the greatest political adventure the two countries 
between them have ever tried. The economy minister's verbal 
lack of self-restraint does not contribute to a greater 
harmonization of relations, which fortunately are good and 
apparently gossip-proof. The Brazilians are, however, partly to 
blame for these untimely remarks, because of the harshness with 
which Itamaraty treated the Argentine distortions concerning the 
establishment of the minimum common tariff for Mercosur. In 
those sectors with long memories and little patience, Cavallo's 
criticisms generate distrust; and there are those who term it an 
Argentine "vice" to attack a neighbor in order to guarantee 
national unity, the most recent episode being that of the 
Malvinas Islands. 
  Minister Cavallo runs an economy that in general terms is 
the 
size of that of Sao Paulo, though not as complex. Thanks to 
less pressing and disturbing variables he could dollarize the 
economy, sell the assets the government had in the sector 
producing goods and services, and control public spending. This 
allowed him to reduce inflation to 7.4 percent annually and push 
the average annual growth rate since 1991 to 7 percent. That is 
not a minor achievement, but it does not make Argentina a 
compulsory model for Brazil. Neither does it prove that the 
macroeconomic differences between the two countries hinder the 
operation of Mercosur. 
  Minister Cavallo and those whose opinions he represents find 
it rather difficult to admit that even though Brazil's 
macroeconomic results are not like those of Argentina -- at 
least not the kind of results of which Argentines are justly 
proud -- the Brazilian economy is much bigger, more diversified, 
more sophisticated and, above all, our management and marketing 
methods are ahead of those of the other Mercosur countries. 
  The result of this, in addition to the very important 
factor that the dollar-peso rate has reduced Argentina's 
competitiveness in international markets, is that Brazil is 
currently Argentina's largest market. In turn, 20 percent of 
Argentine imports are supplied by Brazil, which buys only 9 
percent of its imports from Argentina. If Brazil were 
purposedly selling recession leftovers, such leftovers would be 
the products being purchased by Argentina. Yet this is not 
happening. The products we sell to Argentina can be sold on any 
market. And we sold them even after Minister Cavallo 
unilaterally cancelled the preferential tariffs that we should 
enjoy as members of Mercosur and ALADI [Latin American 
Integration Association]. 
  During the first 10 months of 1993, Brazil registered a 
trade 
surplus of $810 million with Argentina, a figure that is 31 
percent smaller than the figure for the same period in 1992. 
This was not caused by a reduction in the quality of our 
products, or by the dynamics of Argentine industry. Brazil has 
simply complied, without distortions, with the agreements 
reached with Argentina, and started buying Argentine oil and 
wheat instead of purchasing them from other suppliers. In the 
case of wheat, Brazil has even disregarded better offers from 
the United States, thus clearly proving that -- for the 
Brazilian Government -- agreements are valid even if they harm 
our consumers to the benefit of Argentine producers. 
  The year ahead of us poses challenges to those responsible 
for the economies of the two countries. They are serious yet 
different challenges. Brazil, despite its 2,500 percent 
inflation rate, registered a 4.5-percent growth in GDP and a 
9-percent growth in industrial product. Brazil is in an 
advantageous position. Argentina, however, with a 7.4-percent 
inflation rate and a growth rate of 7 percent of its GDP, has a 
high unemployment rate, which affects 17 percent of the 
economically active population. This has put 26 percent of 
Argentines outside the consumer market. It is not just by 
chance that the Menem government will this year concentrate on 
creating jobs in rural areas, in order to avoid the regional 
differences that produce disturbances like those in Santiago del 
Estero. 
  We have always maintained that Sao Paulo is not Brazil. 
Argentines will end up discovering that Buenos Aires is not 
Argentina.

  [Text] Venezuela is expecting a visit by Colombian Foreign 
Minister Noemi Sanin this Wednesday to sign a treaty regarding 
the extradition of Colombian convicts. Venezuelan Foreign 
Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich, meanwhile, said that the latest 
incidents at the Colombian border have complicated bilateral 
relations between the two countries. He said that repeated 
kidnappings, incursions into Venezuelan territory by Colombian 
guerrillas, and the incident involving a helicopter transporting 
a National Guard patrol have cast a shadow over the negotiations 
between Venezuela and Colombia. 
  [Begin recording] [Ochoa] As you know, they are currently in 
the middle of an election campaign in Colombia. We managed to 
keep the Colombian issue out of the political debate in 
Venezuela. Nevertheless, it is a leading issue in both countries 
that has created heated debates whenever there is a political 
process under way. I believe the current situation is the 
result of the heated debates in the Colombian election process. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Would you say the current state of 
relations between Colombia and Venezuela is optimal? 
  [Ochoa] Right now there is the helicopter issue. Venezuela 
has also filed claims regarding kidnappings, border safety, and 
the presence of guerrillas and illegal aliens in Venezuela. 
These are things that undoubtedly complicate bilateral 
relations. [end recording]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 11 Jan (AFP) -- The Colombian 
Government acknowledged on Tuesday the presence of U.S. troops 
on its national territory, which -- it explained -- "are 
carrying out various tasks within the framework of current 
treaties" signed between the two countries. 
  A press communique issued by the National Defense Ministry 
reported there are 259 U.S. soldiers carrying out different 
tasks in various regions of the country. The official 
communique seeks to calm the strong controversy among country's 
politicians and media over the recent arrival of U.S. Marines in 
the area of the Colombian Pacific area, where -- according to 
the government -- they are participating in the construction of 
civil projects in the poor area of Juanchaco.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Jan (NA) -- Military Household 
Chief General Jorge Rearte today denied that there was an 
alleged attack against the plane in which President Carlos Menem 
travelled on 30 December. According to press reports issued 
today, the incident prompted a detour on its route to La Rioja. 
  Rearte stated that the information published today by a 
Buenos Aires newspaper is "completely inaccurate," emphasizing 
that "there was no such detour; the aircraft took the direct 
route." 
  The press report, published today, is based on an alleged 
top-secret military and political report in which those 
responsible for the president's safety allegedly state that a 
missile was aimed at the aircraft transporting Menem to 
Anillaco, where he celebrated the New Year. 
  The report adds that Rearte personally ordered the detour of 
the aircraft from the original route and ordered a prolonged 
circling before landing in La Rioja. 
  Rearte said that La Rioja police "probably" carried out a 
dragnet operation near the airport, adding that it was probably 
just for "preventive purposes." 
  Rearte asserted: "When an important person travels to a 
certain place it is normal to check beforehand for any abnormal 
situation." 
  He added that he was unaware of the origin of the reported 
missile base which, according to the press report, was the 
target of investigations by security forces. 
  Rearte concluded: "The alleged attack is fully dismissed. I 
can assert that absolutely nothing happened."

this afternoon in a ceremony held at the Government

current situation in Mexico as well as the situation in the 
months ahead, the values of dialogue, concord, and strict 
enforcement of the law will guide and set the tone of his work. 
He defined himself as a man who believes in the law, dialogue, 
reason, truth, calmness, and firmness. The new official said he 
is not a party man, explaining this is not the time for speeches 
but for action. He indicated he is going to the Government 
Secretariat not to renounce all the things he believes in but to 
cooperate for the good of Mexico. 
  [Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish

newscast, broadcasts a similar report that includes a recording 
of Jorge Carpizo in which Carpizo states: "My only commitment is 
with Mexico. I do not have a political party. I have accepted 
this position with the sole objective of serving my country and 
the president of the Republic. This is no time for speeches, 
but for deeds. I am a man of principle and loyalty."] 
  Carpizo asked society and its political and social 
organizations for their support. He stressed he would need it. 
During an interview, he indicated he hoped society and the news 
media will give him the time necessary to solve the problem in 
Chiapas State. 
  Also, Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido said the president agreed 
to his resignation. With a broken voice and watery eyes, he also 
asked the Chiapas Congress to change the conditions of his leave 
in order to withdraw from political activities following 42 
years of service. His former aides stood up and gave Patrocinio 
Gonzalez a long and hearty ovation. Eloy Cantu, the federal 
government's official spokesman and Government Secretariat's 
senior official in Chiapas, attended the ceremony. [end

irreproachable record at the National University as well as in 
public service. His image as a human rights defender adds a 
major element to his new post at this time. 
  In Tuxtla Gutierrez, the Chiapas Congress reaffirmed Elmar 
Setzer Marseiller as acting governor. This happened after former 
Government Secretary Gonzalez Garrido sent a letter to the 
Chiapas Congress requesting an extension of his leave as Chiapas 
governor. Diego Valadez took office as attorney general of the 
Republic. 
  [Begin recording of second unidentified reporter] Diego 
Valadez took office as attorney general in a ceremony attended 
by almost all Attorney General's Office personnel. Jorge Carpizo 
McGregor, the new government secretary, thanked the Attorney 
General's Office officials for their cooperation and work, and 
he asked them to give the same support to Valadez so he can 
achieve his goals as head of the Attorney General's Office. 
  Valadez pledged to consolidate the efforts of the former 
attorney general to defend human rights and to strengthen the 
rule of law. Valadez has an extensive record, having held major 
academic, government, and diplomatic posts. Previously, he held 
the post of federal district attorney general. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Ovidio Bellando] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella yesterday received 
precise instructions from the head of state to speed up the 
negotiations linked to an offer made to the United Kingdom to 
clear the mines planted by Argentina in the Malvinas Islands in 
1982. 
  The head of state issued these instructions during a meeting 
of the national cabinet, during which the foreign minister 
reported on the repercussions of the Argentine proposal in the 
London and Malvinas Islands media. During the meeting President 
Carlos Menem also instructed the ministers to promote social and 
economic programs in their areas, on which we are reporting 
separately. 
  Di Tella described as highly positive the opinions published 
in the newspapers THE INDEPENDENT, THE GUARDIAN, and THE DAILY 
TELEGRAPH, which mentioned the scoop published on 4 January by 
LA NACION on the proposal to clear the mines. 
  It was leaked that the foreign minister explained that the 
offer is a consequence of a position championed at the United 
Nations, which favored not only the discontinuation of planting 
antipersonnel mines (so called to differentiate them from 
antitank mines), but the discontinuation of their manufacture as 
well. 
  The foreign minister also explained that according to 
Malvinas Islands sources, it has been estimated that the task of 
clearing the 30,000 mines will cost 5 million pounds (about $8 
million). 
  Although conventional arms are involved, the United Nations 
believes this situation affects civilian communities, because 
the sides that engaged in the war are not removing the mines. 
As an example, diplomatic sources pointed out that these kinds 
of explosions frequently occur in Central America, crippling 
peasants. 
  The foreign minister allegedly reported that he had received 
from London a suggestion that the task be carried out by a 
Commonwealth country in order to avoid the islanders' 
resistance. It would thus not be unlikely that Canadians or 
Australians would participate in this task.

<F P=106> [Article by Ovidio Bellando] </F>
  [Text] Argentina has made an offer to the United Kingdom 
to clear the mines planted by the Armed Forces in 1982 in the 
Falklands. 
  According to British estimates, there are about 30,000 mines 
but local sources estimate the number is much smaller. 
  Early last week President Carlos Menem authorized Foreign 
Minister Guido Di Tella to make the offer, which was received by 
British Foreign Office representative Peter Hall on 30 December. 
  The explosion of some of the mines and the damages they have 
caused concern the islanders, who have fenced off large areas 
near Puerto Argentino where animals and people are banned from 
entering. 
  The Argentine forces thought the British were going to land 
in that region. 
  During the last days of 1993 the British media reported the 
concern over this issue by British public and private 
organizations. 
  According to inquiries made in official circles, there are 
no 
plans of the mined territory. However, even if the exact 
locations of the mines were known, one must bear in mind the 
possibility that they may have moved -- due to the type of 
terrain -- a considerable distance from the barred area. In view 
of this it is believed that the task of clearing the mines will 
take quite some time. 
  According to information leaked on the meeting Di Tella held 
with the British ambassador, the latter thanked him for the 
offer but warned that he could not give an answer until an 
answer was received from the government of the Falklands, which 
probably would be informed about the offer in "the first days of 
1994." 
  According to what Di Tella told LA NACION, the task of 
finding the mines would not be carried out by local experts even 
though there are highly qualified people in the country to do 
this job. The purpose is to prevent the islanders from reaching 
any conclusions that do not match the government's real 
intentions. 
  Since a year ago a group of Argentine engineers has been 
clearing mine fields in Kuwait sown with sophisticated bombs by 
the Iraqi forces during the Gulf War. 
  If the proposal is accepted, the work will be done by 
experts 
from third countries whose salaries will, obviously, be paid by 
Argentina. 
  The purpose of the offer falls within the framework of the 
"desire for a growing dialogue with the Falklands' inhabitants" 
mentioned in the Argentine Foreign Ministry communique issued on 
3 January on the occasion of the anniversary of the British 
occupation. 
  The communique, recalling the 161th anniversary of the 
occupation, also ratifies Argentina's "incontrovertible right to 
its sovereignty" and reiterates its "firm purpose to continue 
with the progress of dialogue and negotiations with the United 
Kingdom with an eye to strengthening mutual confidence and 
expanding bilateral cooperation in the Southwestern Atlantic." 
  It adds that the Argentine Government has a commitment "to 
promoting the islanders' welfare on an equal level with the 
welfare of all inhabitants within Argentine territory." 
  The proposal to clear the mines was termed by some official 
sectors that still criticize the Foreign Ministry's position as 
"more effective than the (Di Tella's) efforts for a 
rapprochement with the islanders through recorded messages and 
friendly letters." These groups are aware that the initiative 
has the presidency's full support.

  [Text] Posadas -- Official sources in Posadas have 
announced that a unique exchange will be established between 
Misiones Province and Cuba. 
  The government headed by Fidel Castro will provide free care 
for patients who go to Cuba from Misiones Province to receive 
treatment for eye, spine, skin, respiratory, or other diseases, 
while the island will receive log cabin type housing, corrugated 
cardboard, and liner or Kraft paper manufactured by the Papel 
Misionero factory, owned by the Misiones Government in 
partnership with the Federal Government. 
  To this end a delegation of government officials, headed by 
Governor Federico Ramon Puerta, will go to Havana in late 
January. During his visit the Misiones governor will sign an 
agreement with Castro. 
<H5>  With Other Provinces </H5>
  The Foreign Ministry reported that this type of agreement is 
called a "counterbalanced trade" agreement, and that one 
agreement of this type has already been signed with Rio Negro 
Province. 
  In addition, similar negotiations are currently under way 
between the Cuban Embassy in our country and Entre Rios 
Province. Argentine diplomatic sources reported that the 
governments from other provinces are also interested in these 
agreements. 
  The Caribbean nation has recently signed a training 
agreement 
with Santa Fe Province to provide advanced training for Cuban 
experts on engine mechanics.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Argentina monitored through 6 
January. 
  The Argentine Government has privatized Hidroelectrica 
Norpatagonica Inc. with the sale of the Piedra de Aguila 
hydroelectric plant to the Hidroneuquen investor group. The 
company made up of Chilean, U.S., and Canadian capital purchased 
59 percent of the shares. (Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish 29 
Dec 93 Economic Section p 1) 
  The trade deficit increased $400 million in October and "the 
upward trend will increase in the last two months of the year." 
Government figures show a trade deficit of $2.327 billion by the 
end of October and total exports until then were $10.9 billion 
while total imports were $13.2 billion. 
  The economic team says it is not concerned because most of 
the imports are capital goods and the projected deficit amounts 
to $2.8 billion for the year. (Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish 
5 Jan 94 Section 2 p 1)

<F P=106> [Article by Enrique Medeot; copyright by CLARIN: "The Fight </F>
To Become the Third Force"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Realignment in the Chamber of Deputies </H5>
  Playing on the same field with Peronists and Radicals, two 
groups are waging a pitched battle to become the standard-bearer 
of the third force in the new Chamber of Deputies. They are the 
so-called Parliamentary and Provincial factions. The latter has 
taken the lead and already won recognition from Chamber 
President Alberto Pierri. The third force is the key to making 
up a quorum and passing any complex law when Peronists and 
Radicals cannot agree. 
  Maneuvering on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies has 
recently risen in intensity, but it is now taking place between 
elements that are not part of the majority blocs (the PJ 
[Justicialist Party] and UCR [Radical Civic Union). The internal 
struggle involves lawmakers of a different stripe belonging to 
the so-called Provincial and Parliamentary groups. Both factions 
naturally lay claim to the banner of the "third force," a banner 
which, whether real or imaginary, may be of some bargaining 
value or when it comes time for give-and-take. Such an occasion 
will present itself whenever there are unresolvable differences 
between Justicialists and Radicals. 
  The Provincial Group has taken the lead and was clearly 
recognized by the government when all of its members went as a 
nice little group to talk--over lunch--with Minister of Interior 
Carlos Ruckauf. The ministry dining room played host to 12 
lawmakers with a mandate from parties that generally have 
complete control of their respective provincial governments. 
  Together they represent the interests of the People's 
Movements of Neuquen, Tierra del Fuego, and Jujuy, joined by the 
Salta Renewal Party, the Chaco Action Party, and the Bloquista 
Party of San Juan. Furthermore, the Provincial Group already has 
officers, who were introduced to Chamber of Deputies President 
Alberto Pierri. They are: Jorge Folloni (Renewal Party), Enrique 
Sanchez Galdeano (Tierra del Fuego), and Carlos Gomez Centurion. 
  The Parliamentary Group includes deputies from the 
Progressive Democratic Party, the Liberal Party of Corrientes, 
the Autonomist Party, the Democratic Party of Mendoza, the San 
Juan Renewal Crusade Party, the Republican Force of Tucuman, and 
the Integration and Development and Jujuy People's Movements. 
  Are the people of Jujuy putting their eggs in both baskets? 
Indeed they are, in this case because the two deputies belonging 
to the bloc are engaged in a petty quarrel with no solution in 
sight: Cristina Guzman vs Pedro Figueroa, the latter preferring 
to align himself with the Provincial Group. 
  The Parliamentary Group says the UCD deputies are all 
united. 
At least they claim that Alvaro Alsogaray, German Kammerath 
Gordillo, and Jose Maria Ibarbia have more or less given their 
word. They look askance at Francisco de Duranona y Vedia, 
however, labeling him--no value judgment intended--as a true 
Menemist lawyer. 
  At one time, they were all part of the Center Interbloc. 
Actually, the Interbloc never got any further than good 
intentions because, when it came time to vote in the Chamber, 
each one heeded his own interests, which were often political! 
  For example, Renewer Folloni maintains that he came to the 
Provincial Group naturally: "The Interbloc never developed any 
united action." More specifically, he recalls that those now 
aligning themselves with the other band hobbled government 
proposals, as in the case of laws privatizing the YPF 
[Government Oil Deposits], the State Gas Company, and social 
security reform. 
  Pierri has recognized the Provincial Group as the third 
force. At least this is the general impression left by the last 
two sessions, during which its representatives spoke third, 
following the Peronists and the Radicals. It should be noted, 
however, that they reject the idea of making up a true bloc. 
  No matter how the lead has changed hands, the Parliamentary 
Group has not stood idly by. Authorized spokesmen say its 
members are well organized and that "things are going quite 
well." They also claim to be willing to act independently of the 
Radicals and Peronists in the Chamber, adding that the one thing 
they have in common is their agreement on the government's 
program. Emerging as standard-bearers of the group are Ricardo 
Leconte (Liberal from Corrientes) and Progressive Democrat 
Alberto Natale. 
  Commenting on the Provincial maneuvering, members of the 
opposing faction could not resist: "They thought we would not be 
able to respond. The Provincial Group thought they would have a 
majority, but it took only a weekend to fix everything." 
Actually, it will take a few--but not many--more sessions to see 
how it all turns out in the movie about those who are trying to 
take advantage of the differences between Justicialists and 
Radicals. In the meantime, the two sides will continue to eye 
one another with distrust. 
<H5>  [Box, p 11] </H5>
<H5>  A Matter of Numbers </H5>
  The two factions fighting over the title of "third force" in 
the Chamber of Deputies are well aware that the "weakness" of 
the Justicialists resides precisely in the fact that they do not 
have the quorum they need to force their political position on 
the Chamber with ease. 
  The members of the Provincial and Parliamentary factions 
base 
their hopes on the fact that, when the time comes, the 
Justicialists will be forced to seek their support when the 
Radicals and other parties resist passage of a proposal dear to 
the ruling party. 
  The Justicialist Party has 128 deputies of its own, one less 
than a quorum and the majority needed to get a law passed. 
However, in practice, the justifiable absences and inexcusable 
cuts of deputies mean that the number drops to unacceptable 
levels.

<F P=106> [Article by Cuban Ambassador to Brazil Jorge A. Bolanos </F>
Suarez: "The Truth About Cuba"] 
  [Text] Some days ago, the CIA once again released 
apocalyptic reports about my country. It is not the first time 
the CIA has done such a thing. In 1961, one such report served 
to obtain President Kennedy's support for the Bay of Pigs 
invasion. Among other things, the report said that 80 percent 
of the population would rise against the government within 72 
hours after the invasion. The deadline was confirmed, but the 
reaction was the opposite. As is known, this was precisely the 
time the Cuban people needed to defeat the invasion. 
  Another example: In December 1990, one year after the 
destruction of the Berlin Wall, 422 frustrated foreign 
journalists returned to their countries after a visit that had 
been arranged for witnessing the collapse of the revolution. At 
least this is what other CIA reports had announced in November 
1990. 
  The Cuban Government does not deny its great economic 
difficulties. However, it tries to handle figures and data more 
impartially than does the CIA. The year of 1993 will be 
recalled as the most terrible year for the revolution. The 
damage caused by the rage of the empire [U.S. Government] was 
increased by the climatic calamities that hit the country, 
causing the loss of valuable lives and material damage estimated 
at $1 billion. 
  Despite such adverse circumstances Cubans have maintained 
their organized society with solidarity, showing -- according to 
ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin America] -- the world's best 
income distribution. Without beggars or homeless people, with 
schools and hospitals for everyone. 
  The motivation for the CIA is today the same as in the past: 
to destroy the revolution. To attain this goal they resort to 
all means to block Cuban efforts to survive and rejoin the 
world's economic system. Such attitudes, says London's 
FINANCIAL TIMES, "are applauded if they are adopted by Communist 
countries like China or Vietnam, but are determinedly and 
unscrupulously sabotaged if they are adopted by the small 
Caribbean island..." 
  After the disappearance of the USSR and the end of the cold 
war, the United States has concentrated on one single country: 
Cuba. The entire formidable destabilization potential which 
operated previously on the countries of the so-called socialist 
world are now concentrated on Cuba. According to U.S. press 
sources, the cost of anti-Cuban operations runs at $700 million 
annually. Operations include fanciful and absurd projects like 
transmissions from a television station on U.S. territory which 
are not seen in Cuba. 
  Despite being condemned for the second consecutive year by 
the United Nations General Assembly, the blockade remains the 
centerpiece of an abominable policy that is more than 30 years 
old. It has banned all trade with Cuba, and it has compelled 
other countries' companies with U.S. technology or capital to do 
the same, flagrantly violating international law. 
  Still unsatisfied, the United States has shamelessly 
pressured and threatened entrepreneurs, whatever their 
nationality, to prevent them from selling oil or food to Cuba. 
Such a blockade has caused not only inhuman losses to the Cuban 
population, but has also hit U.S. entrepreneurs themselves, 
banning access to a market of more than $2 billion annually. 
  It is deplorable that the mass media have totally or 
partially ignored this situation. It is even sadder to see the 
silence maintained about the lonely and manly fight that Cubans 
are waging to resist with dignity, decency, and hope the impact 
of such criminal harassment. 
  In the end, I think that whatever the differences or 
disagreements about my country there are, to write now the 
entire truth about Cuba is equivalent to preserving Latin 
America's independence and sovereignty. Whoever disregards this 
today will certainly pay for it tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Article by Luiz Orlando Carneiro; from the "Diplomatic </F>
Report" column] 
  [Text] Brazilian-Argentine relations were affected last 
week by Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo's remarks 
criticizing the quality of Brazilian export products. The 
Brazilian Foreign Ministry considered that, taking into account 
the political pressure he is enduring, the Argentine minister's 
remarks were intended for "domestic consumption." Thus, in 
order not to make things worse, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry 
chose to only summon the Argentine ambassador in Brasilia to 
verbally convey its displeasure to him. 
  For his part, Brazilian Ambassador to Argentina Marcos 
Azambuja contacted the acting economy and foreign ministers in 
Buenos Aires (Cavallo and Di Tella were on leave) and 
diplomatically lodged with them his protest over Cavallo's 
comments. 
  According to the data supplied by Varig [Rio Grande do Sul 
Airline] available at Itamaraty, Argentina is today the leading 
foreign market for this airline. From January to December 1993 
Varig took 527,000 passengers to and from Argentina. Varig also 
carried 11,000 metric tons of cargo during the same period. 
  These figures are showing why Argentine businessmen, who are 
concerned about the Brazilian trade "drive," are now exerting so 
much pressure on Cavallo. In 1993 (up until October), Brazilian 
exports to Argentina totaled nearly $3 billion. Brazilian 
imports from Argentina have, however, markedly increased as 
well. By October Brazilian imports from Argentina totaled $2 
billion, compared to only $1.3 billion imported during the same 
period in 1992. 
  This is why it has been difficult for Brazilian Government 
officials to understand Cavallo, whose reaction has been 
described by some diplomats as being overblown.

  [Text] Brasilia -- During the Power Struggle [Jogo do 
Poder] television program transmitted by TV Manchete at 2315 
[date not given], Justice Minister Mauricio Correa revealed that 
President Itamar Franco was sounded out between October and 
November to stage a coup "in the style of Peruvian President 
Fujimori" but "thanks to the firmness of the president and 
support of the three military ministers, nothing happened." 
  Correa said: "The president was encouraged to adopt a 
Fujimori-style solution." The minister did not quote names but 
journalist Carlos Chagas, who hosts the program, recalled that 
in those days Senator Pedro Simon made some remarkable 
statements, like when he said that President Itamar Franco was 
even willing to resign in the name of democracy. Chagas now 
interprets this statement as the result of the spirit generated 
by the pressures on the president. 
  The coup possibility revealed by Correa becomes more 
believable if we add to it the rumors of a possible break of the 
institutional order that circulated at the time. A 
well-informed source close to the military chiefs told JORNAL DO 
BRASIL at the time that the three military ministers told the 
president: "In face of the political crisis and the latent 
conflict among national government branches, they were willing 
to offer a support base to allow him to govern." 
  Correa last night confirmed: "The coup did not take place 
only because President Itamar did not want it." Correa said the 
coupists believed the atmosphere for a Fujimori-style solution 
was created by the first charges of corruption against the 
budget committee, the high inflation rate, and the 
dissatisfaction of the military men with their low salaries. 
Correa said: "The public would not complain about a coup 
against corruption charges and high inflation." The minister 
said that this solution, however, "was never considered by 
Itamar."

<F P=106> [Article by Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Henrique </F>
Cardoso] 
  [Text] The passing of the fiscal adjustment program is in 
the hands of Congress. This is a decision of paramount 
importance in order that Brazil might begin 1994 with the hope 
that public finances will be set in order and the national 
budget balanced and, at the same time, so that there might be a 
good chance of success in curbing inflation. We would thus be 
able to consolidate sustained economic growth and strengthen our 
path toward achieving stability and social justice. 
  Are there alternatives to this option? I do not rule out the 
possibility of alternatives; the government does not believe it 
owns the truth. True to the most genuine democratic spirit, and 
perfectly aware of the importance of power-sharing between the 
three branches of government, the government has always been 
open to dialogue and to negotiations with Congress. We welcome 
any proposal that seeks to establish a strict budget balance, 
such as the one we have submitted through the constitutional 
amendment. The only thing that we cannot relinquish is the zero 
budget deficit. Without this, the root cause of inflation would 
continue unabated. In that eventuality, because the government 
would be unable to cover its expenditures with the revenues it 
had at its disposal, it would either have to continue placing 
government securities on the market, or pass the hat around at 
banks to collect funds. And all this would take place at the 
expense of higher interest rates and even worse runaway 
inflation. 
  Those who criticize the government's proposal keep insisting 
that the increase in taxes will exact a great sacrifice from the 
people, and yet they seem to overlook that our objective is to 
put an end to the most unfair and cruelest tax of all, a tax 
that weighs heavily on all Brazilians. A 5-percent increase in 
the federal income tax bracket (or in other words, whoever pays 
10 percent will now pay 10.5 percent income tax) is a light 
burden to shoulder, if one considers that everybody has to 
contribute according to his abilities in the effort to stabilize 
the economy. 
  There are also those who reacted against the proposal to 
establish the Social Emergency Fund, arguing that states and 
municipalities would stand to lose from it. They did not seem 
to realize that this fund is a simple accounting device which, 
by bypassing the constitutional rigidity arising from the system 
that provides that government revenues should be tied to 
appropriations, would be instrumental in balancing the budget. 
Besides the fact that appropriations for states and 
municipalities would in real terms be kept at the same level as 
in 1993, the resources from this fund would return to federal 
agencies to be earmarked for social programs. 
  A little goodwill and national solidarity is all that is 
needed to understand that the government's budget proposal is by 
no means perfidious or Machiavellian. It is a solution tailored 
to the country's needs and possibilities. Furthermore, it has 
above all the advantage of opening up new horizons, as it would 
enable us to sail through 1994 with balanced public accounts and 
-- which necessarily follows -- with the economic stabilization 
measures under way. Thus the year that is about to begin -- a 
presidential year, which is likely to be fraught with many 
anxieties and expectations -- would not force us to sail into 
uncharted waters. 
  Without fiscal adjustment the country can expect nothing 
but hyperinflation, recession, higher unemployment, widespread 
hunger, and abject squalor. We must put an end to the perverse 
cycle of the crisis we are steeped in. The government headed by 
President Itamar Franco -- whose term in office comes to an end 
in a year's time -- has all the political excuses it needs to 
limit itself to a policy of the status quo. It could have 
simply continued with the routine tasks of the state apparatus 
and government programs, while waiting for the elections in 
order to hand over power. Why did it not want to do this? 
Simply because in light of the anguish and privations that 
Brazilians are suffering the government cannot afford to waste 
one single minute. It would be an utter irresponsibility to sit 
back and do nothing. We must prepare the ground so that we 
finish our long journey in an atmosphere of social harmony and 
renewed trust in institutions and in the country's future. 
  This is the path we have followed. Despite all the problems 
we have had the country resumed growth in 1993, and will 
continue to grow in 1994 if we keep on the same course. There 
are no strikes going on at present in our country. The 
purchasing power of wages has been enhanced. Exports and 
imports have grown. Our reserves are at an all-time high. We 
have rescheduled our external debt. The private sector -- 
industries, agriculture, services -- has streamlined and updated 
its methods so as to be in a position to lead the great leap 
forward in the economy that the country is about to make. 
Everything has come together to successfully push forward this 
modernization process the Brazilian economy is undertaking, and 
which will enable us to compete in an increasingly active and 
efficient way on the international market. I have no doubt 
whatsoever that once we settle the fiscal problem and curb 
inflation, there will be a significant inflow of resources to 
our country. The world economy has at present good liquidity, 
and Brazil cannot miss the opportunity of taking advantage of 
this. 
  Nevertheless, in order to do so we must first fully restore 
the soundness of the economy and stamp out inflation. This is 
why, in my capacity as finance minister, I am in a position to 
say that once Congress passes the fiscal adjustment, I am going 
to propose to the president of the Republic that he implement 
the Real Value Unit, the URV, which will be the economy's new 
leading reference index and will contribute to end creeping 
inflation. I will venture to take this step as soon as we have 
achieved a balance in our public accounts, because I believe 
that the mainstream of our society wants to definitely clobber 
inflation. The URV will enable us to pave the way for the final 
stage of the stabilization program, which will entail the 
creation of a new national currency. The change we are 
envisaging is sure to be opposed by profiteers, speculators, tax 
evaders, or those who close their eyes to the social iniquity 
brought about by inflation. But I am sure that it will be 
welcomed by those Brazilians who work, produce, and believe in 
the country's destiny.

<F P=106> [From the "Economic Report" column by Miriam Lage] </F>
  [Text] In spite of inflation, 1993 was exceptional for the 
Brazilian economy. Beside the increase in the GDP to 4.5 
percent -- 10 percent of which corresponds to the industrial 
sector -- the trade balance hit record levels. Although the 
final figure will remain a little below the $15.5 billion 
registered last year, exports and imports continued to increase, 
generating a trade volume of over $60 billion. 
  This is a record figure never before achieved in our trade 
balance. Thanks to exports, the unemployment rate is 
diminishing in Brazil. Acting Industry, Commerce, and Tourism 
Minister Ailton Barcellos Fernandes has said that for every 
billion dollars worth of goods Brazil exports, 80,000 jobs are 
generated. Given that exports have remained above an average of 
$3 billion since last March, one can calculate the job openings 
generated by our foreign trade. 
  The increase in imports, compared with $20.6 billion last 
year, is not worrisome because a lot of machinery and equipment 
has been purchased to make Brazilian industries more competitive 
in the internationalization of the economy: Brazil is preparing 
to face the greatest trade liberation in history, which is 
scheduled for 1995 through the GATT agreement. 
  President Itamar Franco thus has something to celebrate: The 
trade balance surplus increased by 10 percent. This is 
fantastic if compared with the average 4-5 percent increase in 
the rest of the world during 1993. Our exchange balance is one 
of the four highest in the world, to which we may add our 
enviable $26 billion exchange reserves, placing Brazil among the 
top 10 hard currency reserves in the world.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The new version of the 1994 budget, 
which was released yesterday after reformulation of the proposal 
that was submitted to Congress in August, will cause a reduction 
of $12 billion in federal spending with respect to 1993, and a 
$22 billion cut with respect to the first budget bill. The 
revenues and expenditures of the National Treasury will amount 
to $88.8 billion. Planning Ministry Executive Secretary Raul 
Jungman said that the measures will come into force only if 
approved by Congress. "Lawmakers are also responsible for the 
stabilization of the economy, and they will have to decide 
whether we will have a balanced budget, without a deficit." The 
total budget, including debt rescheduling, amounts to $280 
billion. 
  The strict budget proposal establishes that in 1994 
government spending will not surpass revenues, and that public 
debt certificates will be issued only for rescheduling the 
existing domestic and foreign debts. Economist Edmar Bacha, who 
is a special adviser to Finance Minister Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, said that the budgetary balance is the cornerstone for 
implementation of the second and third stages of the economic 
stabilization program, which involves adoption of the URV [Real 
Value Unit] and its transformation into a strong currency. "We 
are getting rid of the need to balance the budget through 
inflation and corruption. We are exchanging that for 
negotiation, which is the only alternative we have, because the 
other would be a dictatorship." 
  In the new budget bill the government provided for a real 
interest rate of 15 percent for 1994, because no new debts will 
be contracted. This will help reduce payment of interest, which 
will drop from $8.7 billion in 1993 to $7.7 billion in 1994.

  [Text] [Finance] Minister Fernando Henrique [Cardoso] has 
disclosed that the URV [Real Value Unit] will not become 
effective until March. 
  Cardoso has reported that the implementation of the URV not 
only depends on the approval of the fiscal adjustment by 
Congress, but also on the passing of the budget. 
  "It was the market that, prompted by speculative motives, 
was 
speculating that the URV would come into force in January," said 
the finance minister.

  [Text] As a consequence of the moralization wave that is 
sweeping across the country in the wake of the CPI's 
[Congressional Investigating Committee] discoveries, the cost of 
public works has dropped by almost half. Construction companies 
are now charging much less for their services. The decline in 
costs has prompted the government to study the formation of a 
special commission to renegotiate contracts. With just half the 
allocation to extend the Fernao Dias Highway, which links Belo 
Horizonte with Sao Paulo, it will be possible to finish the job. 
  A high-ranking DNER [National Highway Department] official 
has given another reason for the drop in public works costs: the 
DNER has paid for the contracted services on time, thus 
preventing the overinvoicing by the construction companies. The 
IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] and the World Bank are 
excited with this trend.

  [Text] Brasilia -- President Itamar Franco on 4 January 
named General Nilton Moreira Rodrigues, commander of the 6th 
Military Region based in Salvador, as superintendent of the 
Sudene [Northeast Development Superintendency]. Moreira 
Rodrigues replaces Cassio Cunha Lima, who left the post in order 
to run in the upcoming elections. Moreira Rodrigues met for 
three hours on 4 January with acting Regional Integration 
Minister General Romildo Canhim, who, together with Senator 
Costa (PFL-MA [Liberal Front Party-Maranhao State]), was 
responsible for the naming of Moreira Rodrigues. 
  In the meeting with Canhim and Sudene Deputy Superintendent 
Eliezer Menezes dos Santos, Moreira Rodrigues was handed a 
detailed summary of Sudene's tasks, which include Finor 
(Northeast Investment Fund), the region's projects, and the 
Northeast Constitutional Fund, which is administrated by the 
Bank of the Northeast. On 5 January, Moreira Rodrigues will 
return to Salvador, where he will hand over the 6th Military 
Region. 
  After he is installed as the head of Sudene, which will take 
place some time next week, the general will move to Recife, 
where the organization has its headquarters.

<F P=106> [Article by Fausto Triana: "Lots of Rumbling About Lifting </F>
the Embargo. Will It Bear Fruit?"] 
  [Text] Hanoi, 3 Jan (PL) -- It began as a rumor in the 
media, growing in intensity as Washington officials were cited. 
There is a lot of rumbling this time about the eventual lifting 
of the economic embargo against Vietnam. But the question 
remains: Will it really bear fruit? 
  Three influential U.S. publications -- TIME, THE WASHINGTON 
POST, and THE NEW YORK TIMES -- have revealed that William 
Clinton's administration is going to lift the U.S. economic 
blockade of Hanoi in effect for almost 20 years. 
  Here in Vietnam there has been no official reaction. A 
Foreign Ministry source consulted by PRENSA LATINA reiterated 
today that they are following the matter with attention but 
without too many expectations. 
  A "secret document" might suddenly surface reporting on U.S. 
prisoners of war being held in dark, underground cells and then 
the screw would be tightened again, added the official, who 
preferred to remain anonynmous. 
  But the truth is that this time there are auspicious 
indications in the air. Gary Ackerman, president of the U.S. 
House of Representatives' Foreign Affairs Committee, has said 
that there is no doubt that the embargo is about to end. 
  Ackerman added that it is only a matter of time and asserted 
that in the coming weeks his government will study several 
alternatives to further ease economic restrictions or to 
eliminate them completely. 
  Everything revolves around a document submitted by Winston 
Lord, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific 
affairs, who, after visiting Vietnam last December, recommended 
"that something be done urgently to reciprocate for Hanoi's 
cooperation in searching for missing soldiers (MIA-POW)." 
  In the last report issued in Hanoi by the Pentagon group in 
charge of the 2,200 MIA-POW (servicemen missing in 
action-prisoners of war) [preceding seven words in English] 
files, Colonel John Gray highlighted Vietnam's extensive 
cooperation and observed that the normalization of bilateral 
relations would help expedite these investigations. 
  Nevertheless, the syndrome of defeat in the Indochina 
conflagration and the manipulation of the sensitive MIA-POW 
issue has divided U.S. public opinion. 
  A poll by THE NEW YORK TIMES indicated that only 41 percent 
of the U.S. population believes now is an opportune time to end 
economic restrictions and renew diplomatic ties. 
  According to NEWSWEEK, the White House's tenant is facing 
another important decision that will be as difficult as the 
ratification of the Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. 
  Clinton, who promised to revitalize the country's economy, 
has set his sights on the flourishing Asia-Pacific region, 
precisely because the southeastern area of this region has 
exhibited one of the world's most dynamic growth patterns. 
  Vietnam is on the verge of entering the powerful ASEAN. It 
currently enjoys observer status in this organization and has 
been strengthening its ties with forum members: Malaysia, 
Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, and Brunei. 
  While just the hint of a possible end to the economic 
blockade of Hanoi conjured up a storm in Washington, in the 
Asian country itself U.S. companies are trying to gain a 
foothold in the already complex competition in a market that 
which was until recently untouched. 
  Meanwhile, the lobbying continues at the White House. 
Clinton is once again being pressured from all sides. Here in 
Hanoi people ask themselves if the old adage -- much ado about 
nothing -- will again prevail.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 4 Jan (PL) -- Telling the whole 
truth about Cuba now is tantamount to protecting Latin America's 
independence and sovereignty, it was stated today by Jorge 
Bolanos, Cuban ambassador to Brazil, in an article published by 
JORNAL DO BRASIL. 
  In the article, entitled "The Truth About Cuba," Bolanos 
denounced the fact the CIA has once again published, a few days 
ago, apocalyptic reports on the Caribbean island. 
  The diplomat emphasized: This is not the first time in 
history that this U.S. agency has undertaken this kind of action 
against Cuba. 
  He mentioned as examples the prediction of an uprising in 
the 
Caribbean country in 1961, during the Playa Giron (Bay of Pigs) 
invasion, and the predictions that the revolution would 
deafeningly fall in December 1990. 
  The ambassador recalled: In the first case, contrary to what 
the CIA asserted, it was the people who defeated the mercenary 
invasion, and the 422 foreign journalists who were on the island 
waiting for "the fall" in 1990 returned disappointed to their 
countries. 
  Bolanos said in his article that the Cuban Government does 
not deny the enormous economic difficulties faced by the 
country, but it goes by undeniably more objective figures than 
the ones the CIA usually presents. 
  The ambassador explained: The year 1993 will be remembered 
in 
history as the most terrible year for the revolution, given the 
damage caused by the fury of the empire (United States), 
compounded by the consequences derived from weather disasters 
which caused casualties and losses, the latter assessed at $1 
billion. 
  Despite these severe circumstances, the diplomat wrote, 
Cubans continue to be an organized, solidary society that shows, 
according to CEPAL (Economic Commission for Latin America) 
[ECLA] figures, the best distribution of revenues in the world. 
There are no beggars or homeless, and everyone has access to 
schools and hospitals. 
  Bolanos said that following the Soviet Union's disappearance 
and the end of the Cold War, the United States' political 
destabilization machinery has concentrated on Cuba. 
  He said the cost of anti-Cuban operations now totals $700 
million per year, and the blockade continues even though the UN 
condemns that policy.

  [Text] Washington, 4 Jan (PL) -- Today, a year after taking 
office, Bill Clinton visited for the first time the CIA's 
general headquarters to give it his vote of confidence in a 
world he says "continues to be dangerous" and "more difficult to 
understand." 
  In this first contact at Langley, which U.S. presidents 
usually make, Clinton told the personnel at the world's largest 
espionage center that he "firmly trusts the intelligence reports 
he receives every morning" on the state of international affairs. 
  Despite the warm welcome afforded to the visitor, the press 
and observers have said that Clinton is not "a totally likeable 
personality" for the espionage services because of his liberal 
past and lack of interest -- according to what is said -- in 
foreign affairs. 
  The visit also serves -- in the opinion of the same sources 
-- to iron out "certain difficulties" between the CIA and the 
White House, stemming from a CIA report to Congress that cast 
Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide in a bad light, just 
when the Clinton administration was working on Aristide's return 
to Port-au-Prince. 
  Another point of contention surfaced after last week's 
disclosure of secret radioactive experiments on humans in the 
United States after World War II, an affair that directly 
involves the CIA. 
  The White House ordered its espionage agency to join the 
government investigations on these tests, which were even 
performed on newborns, the mentally retarded, and inmates, and 
to specify its involvement in these tests, a presidential 
adviser disclosed. 
  "We are going to be working with the CIA, and we expect 
their 
cooperation," said George Stephanopoulos, one of President 
Clinton's top advisers. 
  The big investigation was decided on yesterday at the 
executive mansion in a meeting attended by the Departments of 
Defense, Energy, Health, Veterans Affairs, and Justice, as well 
as the National Security Council. But the espionage services 
were absent.

  [Text] Havana, 5 Jan (PL) -- In spite of all the efforts to 
fight and silence it, a strong trend in favor of developing 
links with the Cuban Government of the island is growing among 
the Cuban population in the United States, a member of that 
community said today. 
  In statements to the local press, Andres Gomez, director of 
the magazine Areito and national coordinator (in the 
United States) of the Antonio Maceo Brigade, pointed out that 
the persons supporting that trend also favor a normalization of 
the relations between Washington and Havana. 
  This theory, Gomez added, is essentially based on 
nonpolitical reasons and its main concern is the lifting of the 
economic blockade against the island, particularly because of 
the island's critical economic situation. 
  "The shortages and sacrifices that our people are enduring 
have moved this large sector to mobilize against the blockade," 
pointed out Gomez, who has been living in the United States 
since 1960 when his family decided to emigrate there, one year 
after the victory of the revolution on the island. 
  The Areito director emphasized that there are very 
dissimilar elements involved in this endeavor. The left is not 
very large, but it has a firm determination. Then, there are 
others who, although not defined as being in favor of the 
revolutionary process -- as the first group -- recognize it as 
legitimate. 
  Then, there are those who decided to support lifting the 
blockade for humanitarian reasons with regard to their families 
and their people, even though the vast majority of them have 
differences -- even serious ones -- with the Cuban Government, 
Gomez added. 
  A growing number of those who migrate, he added, are 
reluctant to obey the orders of the ultrarightists in Miami 
despite the occasional use of violence against anything that 
favors an understanding on Cuba. 
  "Until yesterday the counterrevolution managed to impose in 
Miami the parameters of what is politically permissible," said 
Gomez. As for the Cuban Government's call for a dialogue with 
the community abroad, Gomez feels that "it is necessary and 
prudent to advance in a cautious but firm manner in establishing 
the necessary links between Cuba and its emigrants." 
  The Areito director adds that this should be done 
step by step, binding all those forces that are respected abroad 
as a necessary factor for guaranteeing the well-being of the 
people and national independence, and the legitimacy of the 
revolutionary process, even though there are some who maintain 
their own viewpoints or differences.

  [Text] Havana, 6 Jan (PL) -- Cuba maintains normal 
relations with France, and Cuban authorities value greatly that 
France has not joined the North American blockade against the 
island, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of 
the People's Government, said today. 
  Alarcon acknowledged France's position during a gathering 
with 138 members of a French solidarity airlift to the Caribbean 
nation. The French brought a donation of six tons of medicine 
and other supplies to this capital. 
  Alarcon expressed that within French society there are 
forces 
that favor friendly ties between the two countries, regardless 
of the fact that there is no political or ideological 
concurrence. He noted, however, common French and Cuban 
positions on different issues such as the U.S. blockade against 
Cuba, which France has voted against twice at the United 
Nations. He added that what is taking place in the island, which 
is now experiencing its most difficult and complex moment, must 
be a cause of interest for those who hope for a better world, no 
matter where they live. 
  Alarcon stressed that the economic difficulties facing the 
country -- mainly the internal financial imbalance, high fiscal 
deficit and excess currency -- will be resolved through measures 
that preserve the social justice system developed 35 years ago. 
  Jacques Coubard, assistant chief editor of the daily 
L'HUMANITE; Julien Garavito and Helene Duberos, vice president 
and secretary general respectively of the France-Cuba Society; 
and Communist Senator Jean Garcia from the region of Seine-St. 
Denis are among the visitors. 
  The tour, which began on 30 December and which will conclude 
tomorrow, was organized by the daily L'HUMANITE, mouthpiece of 
the French Communist Party, and the France-Cuba Society, so that 
its members could learn about the Cuban reality first-hand.

<F P=106> [Report by Alejandro Gomez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 8 Jan (PL) -- Juan Contino, first secretary 
of the Union of Young Communists (UJC), said today that it is 
high time that a U.S. administration use some common sense and 
take some steps to change its policy against Cuba. 
  Contino, marking the 35th anniversary of Fidel Castro's 
triumphant entry into the capital at the head of the rebel army, 
said the Cuban youth are saying this, and they have not borrowed 
someone else's head to do their thinking. We were born after 
January 1959 and maintain the principles with which we were 
raised. 
  He affirmed that as long as U.S. presidents continue to try 
and bend us through hunger and by increasing the trade embargo, 
as long as they do not take honest steps and continue to hold us 
hostage to their political whims, all their efforts will be 
doomed to failure. 
  As we celebrate 35 victorious years, they can set up a stage 
and commemorate three and one-half decades of continued failure, 
the young leader proclaimed. 
  Contino stated that it is easy to say 35 years, but so many 
wagers and so many predictions have been made that each one of 
their 12 months have been a profound fiasco for the false 
prophets. 
  The UJC leader pointed out that no one knows how many times 
they have proclaimed the death of the revolution, but they do 
not realize that we Cubans are capable of killing death because 
we have so much life to give to life itself. 
  Later in his speech Contino indicated that in recent years 
Cuba has taken significant, decisive steps in its economy and 
will be forced to take some more by the pressing situation 
brought about by the fall of the European socialist bloc and the 
increasing pressure of the U.S. economic blockade. 
  Cuba was left alone with its principles and its immense 
dream, which is humanly possible, he emphasized. 
  For this reason, the UJC first secretary added, it is 
imperative that Cuba adapt its strategy to the unipolar, 
hegemonic world in which it lives without renouncing its efforts 
to build a society of free men. 
  The dreams cost money, so we must finance them with the 
currency accepted in the world, Contino stated, adding that 
convertible currency is not our goal but the means to achieving 
our goal, which is financing a just society. That we will not 
renounce.

  [Text] Havana, 10 Jan (PL) -- Cubans must improve the 
practice of being the main authors in making decisions on 
specific problems in each place, without waiting for the experts 
to voice their opinions, Ricardo Alarcon said today. 
  The president of the National Assembly of the People's 
Government [Cuban parliament] made the appeal during the 
inauguration of the "I Have an Opinion" information program 
broadcast by Radio Progreso. 
  During the program, a panel of newsmen interviewed the 
legislator on the repercussions in society of topics of key 
interest for the people that were discussed during the most 
recent parliamentary session. Newsmen were particularly 
concerned about the topic having to do with sound internal 
finances. 
  Alarcon insisted there are no reasons why the Cuban people 
should be so concerned waiting for the debates of the assembly, 
because -- he said -- the Cuban parliament follows a system in 
which the people decide and they are the main agents of the 
revolutionary process. 
  He denied that one could remove various influences on the 
actions of the legislative bodies in other societies and by 
virtue of this criteria -- he says -- there are those who tend 
to think that certain important decisions are adopted from 
outside, from above, restricting the role of the citizens to 
that of waiting. 
  In the case of Cuba, we have to get used to developing, not 
a 
theory, but the practice that in a socialist society the people 
should be the main actors in all decisionmaking processes and 
not be a passive object on which action is taken. 
  In other countries, the experts discuss such topics as the 
financial situation, the governments approve it with the support 
of experts, and if there is any negotiation, it is done with the 
powers of that state, with the wealthy people, but in our case 
everything stems from the people, Alarcon emphasized. 
  He added that the regular sessions of the National Assembly 
in December were directed exclusively at initiating a group 
reflection on the topic, precisely to help strengthen awareness 
on topics that are not easy to resolve. 
  In Cuba, he said, we could not have faced the problems 
without a real group action. The first step is for all 
legislators to analyze it. It is naive to believe that we can 
wave a magic wand to resolve the complex, serious, and delicate 
problems that we face. 
  The solutions depend on us, he said. He noted that many 
measures are within the reach of any Cuban at his work post, 
which is why we must adopt them in each working place, aside 
from the decisions of a national nature. 
  The president of the Cuban parliament insisted that after 
the 
analysis made during the last period of sessions, debates 
followed on how to find solutions to the economic imbalances, 
without harming the majority, as would occur with the remedies 
applied in other countries for similar financial crises. 
  We must try to save socialism by preserving the achievements 
of society with a political and realistic view, not 
technocratic, attempting to create a growing awareness of topics 
such as costs, inefficiency, management of resources, 
profitability, and other aspects of Cuba's economic reality, he 
concluded.

  [Text] Havana, 3 Jan (PL) -- Cuba trusts that signals 
coming from the subsoil and translated into an oil production 
increase will in 1994 mark the beginning of the end of the 
economic crisis, which has negatively affected the country since 
the beginning of the decade. 
  Such expectations were expressed on the first day of the 
year 
by President Fidel Castro, who estimated that the sector must 
continue to increase crude oil production and that initial 
exploration, currently carried out in association with foreign 
companies, must begin to show results. 
  For the first time in 30 years, Cuban oil workers produced 
more than a million tons of a oil in a 12-month period. 
Specialists describe the oil as dense, viscous, and with high 
light hydrocarbon content, which makes it more flammable and 
thus harder to control. 
  The 1.1 million tons of oil expected to have been produced 
by 
the end of the year would represent savings of $45 million to 
the national economy and have helped generate 30 percent of the 
electricity used in the country. 
  In addition, hydrocarbon by-products were used to make 
cement 
and basic oils, the latter basically used to produce lubricants. 
  Cuba's record high oil production was the 938,000 tons 
reached in 1986. Successive productions were 894,600 (87), 
716,800 (88), 718,400 (89), 670,800 (90), 521,800 (91), and 
882,100 (92). 
  According to sources at Cubapetroleo, the drop between 1987 
and 1991 was basically due to the depletion of the Boca de 
Jaruco deposit, approximately 45 km east of Havana. 
  This last deposit and the one in Varadero (140 km east of 
Havana) were the most important in the archipelago; 20 
additional deposits have been discovered there in the last 30 
years. 
  During this period -- according to GRANMA -- 65,000 km of 
seismic lines [lineas sismicas] were completed; 1.5 million 
meters of deep shafts were perforated; magnetic, radioactive, 
and geological surveys [levantamientos] were conducted; and the 
use of aerial and satellite photography was regularized to study 
the natural oil and gas [gasopetroliferas] possibilities. 
  Oil prospecting gained strength by the end of last year, 
when 
11 plots on land and superficial waters in the Cuban insular 
platform were offered for international bidding in Canada and 
London. 
  This made possible -- according to TRABAJADORES -- the 
securing of a large number of contracts with foreign firms, 
including the UK's Premier company (to explore 2,990 square km) 
and France's Geopetrol (1,600 km). 
  Jean Louis Remondin, board member of the French enterprise, 
told the local press that he was confident that there were 
important reserves of the so-called black gold in Cuba. 
  The geographic location and the geological and geophysical 
characteristics of the territory contradict those who doubt the 
existence of more oil in the island, the specialist added. 
  In addition to the exploration contracts, Geopetrol has 
similar agreements to recover and improve the Cuban deposits, 
especially those in the Yumuri Valley, Puerto Escondido, and 
Martin Mesa, all in the western part of the country.

  [Text] Managua, 4 Jan (PL) -- Former President Daniel 
Ortega today urged the Nicaraguan people to increase their 
solidarity with Cuba this year and to actively contribute to 
eliminating the illegal blockade imposed by the United States 
against that island for more than 30 years. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Ortega noted actions carried 
out by Nicaraguans in 1993 in support of their Cuban brothers, 
stressing the importance of these actions in light of existing 
poverty in that Central American country. 
  Amid poverty that affects 70 percent of the population, with 
more than six of 10 citizens unemployed and suffering the 
effects of the neoliberal policy of the Violeta Barrios 
government for the past three years, our people generously 
showed their solidarity, Ortega said. 
  He added that people from the humblest neighborhoods and 
towns, patients who received free medical treatment in Cuba, 
professionals and technicians trained in that contry, and 
relatives of others now in Cuba on scholarship participated in 
the campaigns to collect milk and food for the children and 
people of that heroic Caribbean nation. 
  In addition, he said, thousands who have never been to Cuba 
but who completely identify with the people of Jose Marti also 
participated. 
  As an organization, the Sandinist National Liberation Front 
(FSLN) actively participated in these efforts, guiding its 
militants and followers to strengthen the solidarity committees 
in all departments and permanently condemning the blockade on 
Cuba at all international forums. 
  Ortega added that in its relations with the Nicaraguan 
Government, the FSLN obtained from President Barrios official 
support for transferring the collected food and has always 
insisted on the need to maintain normal diplomatic relations 
with Havana, despite pressures. 
  During the past three years, he stressed, there have been 
campaigns to have Nicaragua break relations with Cuba and 
withdraw its embassy in that country. In countering those 
campaigns, the FSLN has maintained a permanent struggle with the 
government -- although in silence, understandably -- to prevent 
our country from participating in the isolation of the island. 
  In Central America, Ortega stressed, the FSLN carried out 
actions in 1993 to counter U.S. pressures to have the Cuban 
issue included in presidential summit agendas. 
  Ortega said that after the signing of the Salvadoran peace 
agreements Washington should contribute to detente in Latin 
America by lifting the blockade of the Cuban revolution, which 
is the desire of most nations as expressed during the past two 
UN General Assemblies.

<F P=106> [Report by Pedro Margolles] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 4 Jan (PL) -- Colombia's ambassador to Cuba, 
Ricardo Santamaria, has said that Cuban-Colombian relations are 
in a mature and solid phase that paves a sure road to many 
possibilities. 
  He told PRENSA LATINA: We are not starting from zero. He 
acknowledged the last two years of work by the consular office 
in Havana. He said: The road is open; this contributes to 
today's mature and solid relations. 
  Regarding the outlook for relations, he said that there are 
good possibilities of further strengthening existing ties. In 
this regard he mentioned public health, tourism, technology, and 
the agricultural and livestock sector. 
  Right now our responsibility is to open those roads and to 
include new sectors, Santamaria said. He recalled that during 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's trip to Colombia, some 
ideas were discussed that could be consolidated by visits from 
Colombian businessmen to the island. 
  Santamaria noted the pleasant impression that the Cuban 
minister produced in his country. He said: He is an honest and 
open person who knows how to touch the heart of the people. I 
can assure you that all those who spoke with him think highly of 
him. 
  Santamaria trusts that with the renewal of bilateral 
relations, Cuba will be seen in the framework in which his 
country has developed its ties with Central America and the 
Caribbean. 
  First, the two economies and commercial possibilities must 
be 
studied, he said. He added: Colombia wants, and has played, an 
important role in this type of agreement in the Caribbean. 
  Santamaria said that in the past two or three years, the 
government of Cesar Gaviria has implemented an aggressive 
economic opening up policy that has led to important agreements 
with Mexico and Venezuela and to negotiations with Central 
American countries. Some of these negotiations, like those with 
Guatemala and Costa Rica, are well under way, the ambassador 
noted. 
  Regarding the Fourth Ibero-American Summit scheduled for 
14-15 June 1994 in Cartagena, Colombia, the ambassador said that 
his country is working hard to prepare for a smooth meeting. 
  All Ibero-American countries have confirmed their 
participation in the meeting, he said. They can be sure, he 
added, that Colombia will offer the necessary guarantees. 
  Santamaria recalled that Cartagena has hosted presidential 
meetings and thus will be able to offer the most suitable 
conditions for a meeting of this nature. 
  Regarding the Colombian electoral process, Santamaria 
discussed changes that will supply new ingredients to the 
upcoming elections. 
  In this regard he mentioned a two-round presidential 
election; an increased number of presidential hopefuls, with 
each party choosing its candidates through internal 
consultations; and the incorporation of new movements, such as 
the 19 April Movement Democratic Alliance, which is carve out a 
role in Colombia's political life as an option to traditional 
parties. 
  Referring to the capture of notorious drug trafficker Pablo 
Escobar Gaviria, the diplomat said that such events close a 
tragic chapter in Colombia's history. 
  He pointed out: Nevertheless, this taught Colombians an 
important lesson -- no one, no matter how powerful, can oppose 
the will of a country, defeat the state's legitimacy, and place 
themselves above the law and institutions. 
  With Escobar's death a chapter on narcoterrorism closes, 
which gave back to Colombians their faith in justice, stressed 
Santamaria, even though he admitted that this does not mean an 
end to drug trafficking. 
  Santamaria repeated: Colombia continues its struggle against 
this scourge with the same intensity and spirit. 
  Regarding the government-guerrilla dialogue, Santamaria 
explained that the Colombian authorities maintain contact with a 
dissident faction of the National Liberation Army (ELN), a group 
called the Socialist Renewal Movement [CRS]. 
  The CRS unilaterally decreed an end to hostilities more than 
a year ago. This created a favorable climate for detente at the 
start of the dialogue with the government. 
  An eight-point agenda is under discussion with good 
prospects 
that by February or March it will end in the demobilization of 
its members and their full incorporation into Colombian 
political activities, Santamaria said. 
  The Colombian ambassador in Havana was in charge of the 
presidential peace council for a year and coordinated 
preparations for a constituent assembly. In addition, he had a 
role in the peace process that ended with the demobilization of 
the M-19 [19 April Movement], Quintin Lame, PRT [Revolutionary 
Workers Party], and EPL [Popular Liberation Army] guerrilla 
groups.

  [Text] Havana, 5 Jan (PL) -- Havana health officials have 
reported that the child mortality rate dropped to 9.4 for every 
1,000 live births in 1993 -- the lowest ever in Cuban history. A 
simple mathematical calculation shows that the 0.8 drop, 
compared to the 10.2 registered in 1992, is equivalent to the 
lives of 121 children. 
  According to information supplied by the Public Health 
Ministry's National Statistics Directorate (Minsap), in 1993 
there were 151,981 births and 1,430 deaths, which were mainly 
caused by perinatal problems (those that occur in relation to 
the birth process) and by several congenital anomalies. 
  According to Minsap statistics, child mortality rates in 
Cuba 
have been decreasing gradually over the past 25 years. For 
example, the figure was 46.7 in 1969, 19.4 in 1979, and 11.1 
child deaths for every 1,000 born alive in 1989. 
  The 9.4 achieved in 1993 gives Cuba the lowest child 
mortality rate in Latin America -- an area that registers very 
alarming figures, like those in Haiti and Bolivia, which were 87 
and 80 respectively, as reported in the World Infancy Status 
report published by UNICEF [United Nations Children's Fund].

  [Text] Havana, 10 Jan (PL) -- The Cuban revolution has 
issued an appeal to its most important social base, the workers, 
urging them to assume a leading role in the epic struggle being 
waged by the country, and to launch an overall offensive given 
the crisis that currently prevails in the nation. 
  An editorial published today by the weekly TRABAJADORES 
insists Cuba mainly needs that workers everywhere to discuss in 
depth issues dealing with the financial reorganization, among 
other vital issues, given the difficult situation that currently 
prevails. 
  "It is time for all of us to realize the specific political 
and educational responsibility that corresponds to the labor 
movement within the struggle for survival and afterwards, when 
we fully enter a different world in many ways," it states. 
  The article gives continuity to other reflections included 
in 
the newspaper concerning the role that must be played by workers 
in the island's economic reorganization process, given the 
worsening of the U.S. blockade and the loss of its main trade 
partners in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. 
  It urges workers to analyze ways to counter the excess of 
circulating money and solve the budget deficit; decide whether 
or not unproductive enterprises should be subsidized; decide if 
it would be appropriate to implement a tax on salaries -- among 
other current topics of interest for all the Cuban people. 
  The publication says: Acquainting himself with the mentality 
of a society owner will enable each worker to implement the 
principle of "I am the revolution." 
  It adds: Nothing can be so demoralizing as laziness, 
indolence, negligence, careless work, lack of control on costs 
and expenses, the brazen squandering of resources, and the 
defeatism which imbues the atmosphere in certain work centers. 
  Assuming its role as official paper of the Central 
Organization of Cuban Trade Unions, the weekly strives to 
prepare approximately 3 million workers for imminent changes in 
the country's economic and financial system and, in fact, 
propose possible solutions from their work posts. 
  What actions can we carry out to encourage discipline and 
work morale? How can we produce more, or better, with less 
costs? Where can we reduce personnel? What policy should we 
follow with excess personnel? What can we do to reduce or 
eliminate subsidies? These are some of the issues on which it 
urges workers to meditate.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Dec (PL) -- Lupo Rattazzi, president of 
the charter company Air Europe, announced here today that this 
year Air Europe brought 49,000 vacationers from Europe to three 
Cuban tourist sites. 
  Rattazzi said that the jump in the figures since 1990, when 
the airline began operations in Cuba by bringing 2,360 
passengers here, is the most eloquent expression of the 
satisfactory results of its efforts. In 1991, Air Europe brought 
15,975 travelers to Cuba, and in 1992 the figure increased to 
29,988. 
  Rattazzi said the number of Italian tourists traveling to 
Cuba is growing by leaps and bounds, and he added that, in turn, 
Air Europe expects to bring some 120,000 tourists to Cuba in 
1995. This, he added, is more than 10 percent of the 1 million 
tourists Cuba wants to attract. 
  Rattazzi pointed out that Air Europe has five flights per 
week and currently travels to three Cuban tourist locations: 
Havana, Varadero, and Ciego de Avila. 
  Rattazzi added that Air Europe works with 10 Italian tour 
operators and is working for the first time with the Going 
company, which he described as a serious firm that will have 
great success in Cuba.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Foreign Ministry on Chiapas </F>
Situation"] 
  [Text] Rome, 2 Jan (ANSA) -- The Italian Foreign Ministry 
Foreign Office crisis committee, which has been following 
developments after native Mexican rebels of the Emilio Zapata 
Liberation Front occupied five towns in the southern Mexican 
province of Chiapas, confirmed those rebels had withdrawn into 
the mountains this morning, taking with them supplies of food 
and medicines. 
  The Foreign Office also said that there had been 
"considerably more" than the initial estimate of about 40 
Italians staying in and around the town of San Cristobal de las 
Casas, in Chiapas near the Guatelmalan border. 
  Most were said to be tourists traveling in groups, primarily 
from Milan, Rome and the Veneto region. According to the Italian 
embassy in Mexico City, most of the Italian tourists have by now 
left the town aboard tour buses directed toward the capital of 
the province, Tuxtla Gutierrez. 
  The Foreign Ministry's report confirmed that of Turin 
resident Carla Astigiano, who had been in telephone contact 
Saturday and Sunday with her husband Mario Paravano, staying in 
San Cristobal with his business partner, Maurizio Albertini. 
  After a call from her husband Saturday to say he and other 
foreigners were cloistered in the hotel, Astigiano had learned 
from the hotel manager that today her husband and other Italians 
had been evacuated for Tuxtla. 
  She later spoke with her husband around 19.00 Italian time 
(18.00 GMT) and said he told her the region was heavily 
patrolled by the Army. 
  According to some reports, there were six deaths and 
numerous 
injuries during the takeover of the five towns Saturday. There 
were no reports of deaths among civilians or tourists, and 
eyewitnesses said the rebels were careful not to involve 
civilians in fighting. 
  Conflict between law enforcement agents and the estimated 
200-300 guerrillas involved in yesterday's occupation was 
expected to continue after the guerrilla withdrawal from San 
Cristobal, a picturesque highland city with a population of 
about 80,000 that is a growing favorite with tourists. 
  Although the Mexican government denies it, rebels among 
southern Mexico's indigenous population have been fighting a 
widening guerrilla war against the conditions of extreme poverty 
and exploitation in which they live. 
  About one third of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the 
Chiapas 
province are indigenous peoples or `Native Mexicans,' and their 
cause, represented by ethnic and civil rights organizations, has 
drawn support from the north and south American clergy loosely 
grouped under the `liberation theology' label. 
  The area is also one that has been intensely studied and 
visited by anthropologists, some of whom have actively supported 
the Indios cause. 
  But in an inquiry last summer, ANSA found that social 
protest, largely unheeded by Mexican officials and mostly 
ignored by the church establishment, was beginning to develop 
into armed revolt. 
  The clandestine Zapata Liberation Front was reported to have 
recently made contact with remnants of Procup [Clandestine 
Revolutionary Workers Party - Union of the People], the 
guerrilla organization active in Mexico in the 1970s. 
  Even after the Mexican Army mobilized 3,000 men last May to 
hunt down a patrol of 40 guerrillas who had killed two soldiers, 
the governor of Chiapas Patrocinio Gonzalez, continues to deny 
that an armed guerrilla movement exists. 
  Gaspar Morquecho of Chiltac, a group that aids the Indios in 
San Cristobal, said earlier this year that "an armed struggle 
might be beginning" adding that "the crisis is driving the 
Indios to the limit of their endurance." 
  Last August, when Pope John Paul II visited Merida on the 
Yucatan peninsula during his American tour, the bishop of San 
Cristobal, Monsignor Samuel Ruiz, sent a letter to the pope 
warning him of the difficult conditions of the Indios in that 
region. 
  Ruiz said there was a danger of "struggle and tensions" not 
only in Chiapas but elsewhere in Mexico with indigenous people 
suffering from the government's free market economic policies. 
  The San Cristobal cardinal, a leading exponent of liberation 
theology has been accused by the Vatican of "doctrinal and 
pastoral errors." Mexican sources say that condemnation was 
pushed for by powerful local economic interests. 
  "Practically without hope" was how Padre Jorge Rafael, head 
of the Dominican missionaries in nearby Ocosingo, an outpost on 
the edge of the great central American Lacandona forest, 
described the condition of a people who are forces to emigrate 
2,000 miles away to Florida to survive. 
  Today's dead and injured were said to have been mostly among 
police, in clashes said to have taken place in the villages of 
Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal and Las Margaritas during 
Saturday's takeover. 
  Not much is officially known about the Emilio Zapata 
Liberation Front, named after the Mexican revolutionary figure 
who lived from 1877 to 1919, apart from the fact that 
yesterday's occupation force was said to number between 200 to 
300, and may have some non-Indian participants. 
  Last July, native Mexican rights organizations criticized 
the 
Mexican Catholic church and the organization of the Pope's 
approaching visit, saying it "only has meaning for the 
government and for the church." 
  The church "despite the assassination of Cardinal Posadas at 
Guadalajara, only wants to smooth things over at all costs," 
Genaro Dominguez, chief of the National Committee of Indian 
Peoples, told ANSA. 
  (In a stunning attack on May 25, Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas 
Ocampo, an outspoken critic of Guadalajara's violence and drug 
culture, was shot and killed by narcotraficantes in a gun battle 
outside Guadalajara airport.) 
  "If I were meeting the Pope," Dominguez said last summer, "I 
would tell him to seek a real contact with indigenous peoples, 
beyond formal meetings and without middlemen, to touch the real 
truth of an extremely difficult situation that is quite 
different from that which Papal Nunzio Girolamo Prigione is 
likely to give him." 
  The `indios' continue to live with "starvation, insecurity 
and exploitation such as existed in the time of Porfirio Diaz," 
Dominguez said, adding that in the Yucatan, "the native peoples 
have by now been humiliated, whereas elsewhere a visit like this 
could create problems." 
  Apparently, he referred to the growing rebel activity in the 
neighboring province of Chiapas. 
  Press sources in Mexico City confirmed other rumors that the 
rebels, although they had withdrawn from San Cristobal de las 
Casas, continued to occupy the four other smaller villages 
(Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal and Las Margaritas) in the 
highland forest region near the Chiapas-Guatemalan border. 
  Government forces are said to be battling with guerrillas 
this afternoon (local time). 
  A spokesman for the Mexican Interior Ministry said that "if 
necessary the central government will take over the state of 
Chiapas," but argued the fighting was "an isolated phenomenon" 
and that the government "didn't intend to fall for the 
provocation of this armed group. 
  Church authorities in the region meanwhile volunteered to 
act 
as mediators between the government and the rebels and appealed 
to the guerrillas to lay down their arms. The local episcopate 
has said it thinks the government should begin negotiations to 
deal with the region's severe socio-economic problems. 
  Yesterday Mosignr Felipe Arizemendi, archbishop of Tapachula 
in Chiapas, warned that "the poverty and conditions of 
inequality in which many indigenous groups live has become a 
breeding ground for a real insurrection. Extreme poverty is 
always a threat to social peace," he said. 
  Emiliano (NB: not Emilio) Zapata, after whom the rebels 
named 
their band, remains a symbol of indigenous rebellion against the 
latifundista land owners 75 years after his death. 
  Born in 1877, Zapata, who came from a humble family, fought 
among the guerrillas who overthrew dictator Porfirio Diaz. A 
great campaigner for social justice, he never supported the 
revolutionary government of Francisco Madero and favored a more 
radical expropriation of large land holdings. 
  Zapata's name is closely identified with the agrarian reform 
that has still not been completed more than a century after the 
Mexican revolution. 
  In 1919, Zapata was slain in the town of Cuernavaca on 
orders 
of president Venunziano Carranza. 
  In addition to the 6 deaths Saturday, another 10 persons are 
said to have died in today's fighting between the Emiliano 
Zapata Liberation Army and the Mexican army, sources in the 
capital reported. 
  The skirmishes were said to be intense, with soldiers 
mistakenly firing on an Red Cross ambulance at one point. 
  According to the Defense Ministry, the guerrillas, after 
abandoning San Cristobal de las Cases this morning at dawn, 
surrounded two military outposts about 10 km from the town. 
  Official sources placed the number of rebels at no more than 
200 but press sources estimated 400-2,000. The rebels reportedly 
intend to head toward the capital of the state of Chiapas at 
Tuxtla Gutierrez. 
  Additional guerrilla forces were said to be continuing to 
hold the towns of Ocosingo, Altamirano, Chanal and Las 
Margaritas. At the airport of Ocosingo, where the rebels were 
loading planes with supplies picked up during yesterday's 
occupation of San Cristobal, hungry local residents were rumored 
to have raided the guerrilla stocks.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Ramon Diaz] </F>
  [Text] The border problems of the past few days, of which 
one of the nations' four military bodies has directly suffered 
the consequences, have forced the National Guard [GN] High 
Command, led by General Commander Pedro Jose Romero Farias, to 
declare a state of emergency. At the same time, he alerted his 
troops and ordered them to mobilize toward the different 
security areas bordering Colombian territory. 
  The GN's decision is due to the recent increase of border 
problems, and according to the GN high command, there is no 
quick solution in sight. Apparently, Colombian authorities are 
not willing to cooperate in finding solutions to the problem. On 
the contrary, they have accused the GN of raiding their 
territory, thereby violating, according to their story, their 
territorial integrity. What occurred three days ago is the best 
example. On Friday, at approximately 1200, a GN commission was 
implementing an intensified border patrol program in the 
southwest region when their aircraft, a Bell Ranger 212 
helicopter with registration No. GN-8008, was downed by a group 
of Colombian rebels. Nevertheless, the Colombian authorities 
accused the GN of violating their airspace. 
  According to the Venezuelan aircraft pilots' story, GN 
Commander Manuel Bompart Pinango and GN Major Jesus Lozano 
Guanipa, accompanied by six soldiers -- one of whom was wounded, 
2d Corporal Yasmin Jaimes Canas -- were patrolling the security 
strip. Suddenly, Colombian guerrillas moving about in Venezuelan 
territory attacked the unit. The missiles hit the tail rotor 
forcing the aircraft to crash to the ground, thereby destroying 
the equipment. Fortunately, no human lives were lost. The 
rebels' attack took place exactly 500 meters from Hato El 
Tormento and approximately 10 km from the border checkpoint El 
Cututi on the banks of the Arauca River. 
  Given this case as well as others on other occasions, the GN 
high commanders believe the border problem with Colombia is 
becoming more and more intolerable. To begin with, the region is 
not secure. There is no way to prompt Colombian authorities to 
plan and carry out actions with Venezuela to guarantee 
territorial integrity on this side of the border. Therefore, 
guerrillas, kidnappers, and drug traffickers are having a heyday 
in this region, specifically in the Paez District, the Apure 
State, and in the autonomous municipalities of Catatumbo and 
Colon in Zulia State. 
  Meanwhile, according to authorities, the GN has been the 
target of a campaign to discredit them in recent months. This 
campaign has been stepped up recently not only by rebels who 
operate in the security areas, but also by Colombian 
authorities, who do not hesitate to accuse GN members of 
attacking Colombia's territorial integrity. 
  Given this serious situation in which a satisfactory 
solution 
has not been reached with the Colombia authorities, the GN high 
commanders, with prior authorization from their superiors, 
issued a general alert order to all commands in border security 
areas. Simultaneously, as a support operation, troops have been 
deployed in the region bordering Colombia. 
  Division General Pedro Jose Romero Farias, GN general 
commander, confirmed that all the commanders on the border have, 
in effect, been issued a "general alert" order. In addition, 
military personnel have been deployed to the region to control 
attacks by Colombian rebels. 
  Romero Farias said: "We will combat these irregular actions 
without any hesitation. We will also defend, however, the GN's 
honor, considering the GN has been the target of a campaign to 
discredit it by bandits who now feel cornered as a result of the 
operations carried out by the GN." 
  Meanwhile, it was learned at Fort Tiuna that Army commands 
have stepped up their action in the Joint Task Force mission. 
These are contingents that jointly execute military operations 
to guarantee Venezuela's territorial integrity. Within this 
framework, their task is to combat and wipe out the presence of 
Colombian rebels and combat other crimes, among which are drug 
trafficking, contraband, and common crimes that constantly 
disrupt the peace and prevent normal socioeconomic development 
in the region. 
  The Army's idea with the so-called Joint Task Force is to 
create an atmosphere of security for the people in the area and 
to combat guerrilla activity -- that is, to minimize the 
Colombian guerrillas' presence as well as their activities, 
reduce the number of kidnappings, increase the Armed Forces' 
prestige in the region, and preserve sovereignty and territorial 
integrity. 
  Given these incidents on the border, Army Div. Gen. Alberto 
Emerich Esqueda Torres, permanent secretary of the National 
Security and Defense Council, announced yesterday the new border 
security arrangements will definitely be made known this week. 
It is very possible, he added, that President Ramon J. Velasquez 
will disclose the decree's details. It is also possible the 
president will speak to the governors and cattle ranchers of 
those regions in the province that borders other nations. After 
these talks, President Velasquez will make the final decision on 
whether or not to issue a decree regarding border security areas. 
  Precisely because of the course of events on the nation's 
borders, a group of experts from the Institute of Higher Studies 
on National Defense, directed by Vice Admiral Mario Ivan Carratu 
Molina, traveled to the western region -- specifically to the 
Falcon, Zulia, Tachira, and Apure States. Pompeyo Marquez and 
Leandro Area from the Negotiating Commission on Border Matters 
with Colombia; Jose Rodriguez Iturbe, president of Congress' 
Foreign Policy Commission; and other personalities are also 
participating in this mission. 
  According to Carratu Molina, the mission's goal in these 
areas is to verify important political, economic, social, and 
military aspects within the security and defense framework. 
Carratu Molina said: "At each of the sites to be visited, we 
will meet with the state governors, garrison commanders, and 
military unit and development corporation commanders of each 
region. 
  In Zulia State particularly, Army Brigade Gen. Romer Cumare 
Roa, commander of the Army's 1st Infantry Division, and his 
staff will discuss the military situation on the state's border 
area with the mission. This situation is very critical because 
of constant attacks by Colombian criminals. 
  The Army's 2d Infantry Division brigadier general and GN 
Brig. Gen. German Valera Araque, chief of the GN's 1st Regional 
Command in Tachira State, were the ones who reported what was 
happening in the region. 
  The mission arrived at Guasdualito (Apure) and La Fria 
(Tachira) yesterday, where they toured the border posts and 
visited the corresponding military units.

<F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Venezuela and Colombia this morning signed a 
bilateral treaty on the repatriation of prison inmates. The 
agreement, proposed by Venezuela, will allow approximately 1,500 
Colombian inmates to return to their country and finish serving 
there the sentences ordered by Venezuelan courts. 
  Eighteen months after the agreement to allow prisoners to go 
to Colombia was presented, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Fernando 
Ochoa Antich and Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio 
today signed the final document. 
  The agreement calls for the transfer of prisoners, provided 
they have been sentenced by the courts. Of the 2,800 Colombian 
prisoners in Venezuelan jails, only 1,500 qualify under the 
agreement. Nonetheless, the agreement is voluntary, which means 
that both Venezuelans and Colombians will be able to choose if 
they want to be repatriated or not to their country of origin.

  [Text] President-elect Rafael Caldera has insisted he will 
do everything possible to fulfill his electoral promise of 
suspending the controversial value-added tax [VAT]. 
  Caldera made this statement during a ceremony in his honor 
given by members of the Venezuelan Academy of Language. The 
ceremony was also attended by Venezuelan President Ramon J. 
Velasquez and other representatives from the Executive and 
Judicial Branches. Rafael Caldera pointed out that as soon he 
starts his administration, he will present several proposals to 
the new parliament in an effort to make the VAT more just. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] I hope Congress will accept this. 
I have heard that some groups seem to be interested in learning 
more about my proposal and in accepting it in principle. I hope 
this will be the case. [end recording] 
  When consulted about the possibility of dismissing charges 
against the individuals involved in the massacre at El Amparo, 
the president-elect emphasized that the current government 
should be very careful in this respect.

  [Text] Official sources told EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO on 4 
January that the government fully confirmed the 1994 economic 
program and the main targets designed with IMF experts during a 
3 January meeting at the presidential residence in Punta del 
Este. 
  In addition to President Luis Alberto Lacalle, Economy and 
Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas; Gustavo Licandro, the 
Economy and Finance Ministry under secretary; Javier De Haedo, 
the Planning and Budget Bureau director; and Ernesto Talvi, the 
Central Bank economic policy manager and a Central Bank adviser, 
participated in the meeting at the Punta del Este official 
residence. 
  The sources noted that Lacalle and his economic team 
reviewed 
last year's main achievements and confirmed the main guidelines 
for the 1994 program. 
  The sources said these policy decisions are aimed at having 
the inflation rate meet the monetary and foreign exchange rate 
projections and achieving strict compliance with the 
expenditures policy in order to "again" achieve the fiscal 
balance target. 
  In addition, official projections estimate that "for the 
fifth consecutive year" the net debt levels will be reduced, an 
approximate 1.5-percent economic growth rate will be achieved, 
the Central Bank reserves will grow again, and a deficit-laden 
[as published] trade balance will be achieved. 
  The program keeps a 33 percent ceiling for the public 
sector's salary increases in 1994, including an additional 
2.7-percent increase for the settling of accounts and 9-percent 
adjustments in May and September. 
<H5>  Spending Constraints </H5>
  The sources explained that the implementation of a number of 
measures was confirmed given the 1993 salary adjustments and the 
loss of some financing sources prompted by tax reductions. 
These measures will allow the government to achieve a fiscal 
balance during its last year of administration, thus closing a 
$270 million fiscal gap, involving about two percentage points 
of the GDP. 
  The aforementioned measures include limiting current 
expenditures to 90 percent of those actually incurred in 1993, 
cutting back on investments in central administration and public 
enterprises, adjusting for lower unbudgeted expenditures, and 
increasing ANCAP [National Administration of Fuels, Alcohol, and 
Portland Cement] and UTE [State Electric Power and Telephones] 
rates by another 10 percent. The 10-percent increase in ANCAP 
and UTE rates already has been partially implemented through the 
November and December adjustments.

  [Text] Diplomatic sources reported that negotiations 
between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay on the 
establishment of a common external tariff for Mercosur [Common 
Market of the South] member countries could reach a successful 
conclusion this week. The countries would establish a 12 
percent common external tariff, which would become effective in 
the year 2001, on investment goods, software, and hardware. 
  The agreement between Argentina and Brazil, after frantic 
bilateral negotiations, would result in the implementation of 
customs duties on the aforementioned products, something Uruguay 
and Paraguay would accept during the meetings that will take 
place in Montevideo this week. The controversy between 
Argentina and Brazil stemmed from their different stances, both 
on when the common external tariff should take effect and on the 
tariff level. Brazil did not want investment goods, software, 
and hardware included in the customs union for five years and 
wanted to be protected by a 35 percent tariff. Argentina, on 
its side, contended that these products had to enter Mercosur 
countries duty-free and that this provision had to be enforced 
immediately. 
  The possible agreement would give Mercosur member countries 
some leeway to negotiate a zero common external tariff until 
2001. Furthermore, it would entail an increase in tariffs for 
agroindustrial machinery, industrial equipment, hardware, and 
software for Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

  [Text] The Navy will install complementary artillery 
systems in seven warships this year. It involves 10 guns that 
were purchased in 1993. Two of these guns will be installed in 
each of the three frigates of the Sea Force and the rest will be 
installed in the four Navy minesweepers, one gun in each boat. 
  The frigates were manufactured in France, as were three 
other 
light patrol crafts manufactured in 1981 at Uruguay's request. 
These patrol crafts have design problems and suffer constant 
cracks in the rudder. A decision has thus been made to sell 
them and the proceeds would be used to improve Navy salaries. 
  The Navy has four minesweepers from the former German 
Democratic Republic's disbanded Navy, four minesweepers based in 
the Uruguay River, two support ships that usually run to 
Antarctica, the training ship Capitan Miranda -- which is 
currently under repair in Spain, a buoy tender, a tugboat, and 
three amphibious craft. 
  The Navy is also studying the possibility of adding a new 
helicopter to the Naval Aviation fleet of three helicopters, 
various maritime patrol planes, and training planes. 
  The weekly "BUSQUEDA" yesterday published a report stating 
that between 24 December and 2 January the Navy released 
personnel "to generate savings that (...) will alleviate a 
difficult economic situation." 
  Naval sources said that between 24 December and 2 January 
"there were no meals for personnel" in an "unprecedented lack of 
foresight" in the Navy. 
  The sources explained that guard services like those at 
weekends were posted, but the situation returned to normal early 
this week when the 1994 budget funds became available. Defense 
Minister Daniel Hugo Martins subsequently confirmed this report 
to Radio Carve.

<F P=106> ["Text" of basic agreement for the resumption of the </F>
negotiating process between the Government of Guatemala and the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity; issued in Mexico City 
on 10 January] 
  [Text] The Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] delegations, having met in 
Mexico City from 6 to 9 January 1994 under the auspices of the 
UN secretary general and as guests of the Government of Mexico, 
have reached the following agreement on the framework for the 
resumption of the negotiating process to reach a lasting and 
firm peace agreement: 
<H5>  I. Negotiation Agenda </H5>
  The parties will negotiate the general agenda on the set of 
issues for the Mexico agreement. For each point, the parties 
will jointly decide on the scope of their commitments, which 
will be subject to verification. 
  The government and the URNG have pledged to be duly 
represented during the negotiations by high-level delegates in 
order to reach political accords that are within the 
constitutional framework, without limiting their ability to 
reach accords on institutional and constitutional reforms. 
<H5>  II. Moderating Bilateral Negotiations </H5>
  The parties agreed to request that the UN secretary general 
appoint a representative to assume the duties of moderator in 
the bilateral negotiations between the government and the URNG. 
The parties agreed that the moderator may propose all 
initiatives aimed at expediting the signing of a lasting and 
firm peace agreement. 
<H5>  III. Civil Society </H5>
  Both parties recognize the contribution of sectors that, as 
a 
result of the Oslo Agreement, attended the meetings in El 
Escorial, Ottawa, Quito, Metepec, and Atlixco with the URNG. 
Such meetings gave momentum to the negotiating process in 
Guatemala. Their participation and contribution helped make the 
beginning of direct negotiations between the government and the 
URNG command possible. 
  The parties agree that Guatemalan society will continue to 
play an essential role in the achievement of peace and in the 
process of reconciliation. 
  Without affecting other mechanisms and forums, be they 
temporary or permanent, aimed at favoring national 
reconciliation, the parties agreed to promote the creation of an 
assembly. Such assembly will be open to participation by all 
nongovernmental sectors of Guatemalan society, provided that 
they can prove their legitimacy, representation, and legality. 
This assembly will operate during the negotiating period and 
shall have the following functions: 
  i) To discuss the substantive agenda of the bilateral 
negotiations, that is points ii to vii of the general agenda of 
the Mexico Agreement, in order to establish positions of 
consensus. 
  ii) Convey to the UN moderator, the Government of 
Guatemala, and the URNG the recommendations and suggestions made 
as a result of their deliberations. Such recommendations and 
suggestions will not be binding and will be aimed at 
facilitating an understanding between the parties. The assembly 
will discuss the substantive agenda in accordance with a 
calendar adjusted to the established terms of bilateral 
negotiations, and it will not be able to delay the process of 
bilateral negotiation. 
  iii) To know the bilateral accords on the substantive 
agenda concluded by the parties and endorse said accords to give 
them the character of national commitment, which will facilitate 
their implementation. However, if for some reason this 
bilateral accord is not endorsed, this accord will maintain its 
validity. 
  The parties agreed to ask that the Bishops Conference of 
Guatemala consider Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno for the post 
of conciliator, when appointing the president of the assembly. 
The president of the assembly will have the support of an 
organizing committee. The organizing committee will consist of 
representatives from each of the sectors that participated in 
the Oslo process and representatives from Mayan sectors. 
  The president of the assembly will have the following 
duties: 
  i) To convene the assembly. 
  ii) To organize its deliberations with the assistance of 
the organizing committee. 
  iii) To promote the drafting of recommendations for a 
consensus on the points of the agenda. 
  iv) To inform the UN moderator and the parties of the 
recommendations and guidance suggested as a result of the 
assembly deliberations and to participate in special sessions of 
the bilateral talks convoked for this purpose by agreement by 
the parties concerned. 
  v) To receive from the UN moderator the bilateral 
agreements on substantive topics signed by the two parties. To 
inform the assembly about them and promote their approval by the 
assembly. 
<H5>  IV. Role of Friendly Countries </H5>
  The parties ask the Governments of Colombia, Spain, the 
United States, Mexico, Norway, and Venezuela to constitute a 
group of friends to the Guatemalan peace process. The friendly 
countries, duly informed of the progress and content of the 
negotiations between the parties, will have the following duties: 
  i) To support, with their efforts, the UN secretary 
general representative in speeding up the negotiation process. 
  ii) To give greater security and firmness to the 
commitments made by the parties in their role as honor witnesses 
of the agreements reached within the negotiating process, when 
the parties so request it. 
<H5>  V. Procedures </H5>
  i) Dissemination: The parties agreed that the bilateral 
negotiations will be carried out under the utmost secrecy to 
guarantee that they will be held in a climate of trust and 
seriousness. They agreed that the only public information on 
the status of the talks will be given by the representatives of 
the UN secretary general in order to coordinate them with the 
work of the assembly. The moderator and the president of the 
assembly will establish adequate agreements to permit an 
exchange of information that will not violate the secrecy needed 
for the negotiations. 
  ii) Temporary framework: The parties expressed their 
commitment to reach an agreement for a firm and lasting peace 
within the shortest time possible in 1994. Within this context, 
they agreed to give proof of the necessary flexibility for the 
successful negotiation of the general agenda. 
  iii) Within the framework of their efforts to speed up the 
negotiating process, the parties recognized the advisability of 
resorting to any measure that will bring about rapprochement and 
agreements between them and stated that they are wiling to 
respond to any requests made by the moderator in this regard. 
<H5>  VI. Verification Mechanisms </H5>
  Verification is a key factor in guaranteeing compliance with 
and respect for the agreements. Consequently, the parties 
reiterated that all agreements must be accompanied by the 
appropriate national and international mechanisms for 
verification. The United Nations gives a high degree of 
reliability to international verification. Both parties agreed 
to ask the United Nations for verification of all the agreements 
in substantive as well as operational aspects. 
  [Dated] 10 January 1994, Mexico City 
  The following signed on behalf of the Guatemalan Government: 
Hector Rosada Granados, Mario Permuth Litswa, Max Kestler 
Farnes, Antonio Arenales Forno, Generals Marco Antonio Gonzalez 
Taracena and Victor Manuel Argueta V., Colonel Victor Manuel 
Ventura A., and Ernesto Viteri Echeverria. 
  The following signed on behalf of the URNG General Command: 
Gaspar Ilom, Pablo Monsanto, and Rolando Moran. On behalf of 
the URNG Political-Diplomatic Commission: Luis Becker Guzman, 
Miguel Angel Sandoval, and Mario Vinicio Castaneda, as the 
adviser. 
  On behalf of the United Nations: Jean Arnault

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 12 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  A Central Bank of Honduras news release indicates that 
inflation, measured through the Consumer Price General Index, 
reached 0.6 percent during December 1993. The release also 
indicates the economic sectors which experienced the highest 
increases were housing, 1.1 percent; food, 0.7 percent; personal 
care, 0.6 percent; and clothing and health care, 0.4 percent. 
Meanwhile, the Transportation sector decreased 1.6 percent. 
  Marginal inflation for the December 1992-December 1993 
period 
reached 13 percent, which is double the previous period. Average 
inflation, meanwhile, increased by 10.7 percent, which is higher 
than the 8.8 percent reached in 1992. (San Pedro Sula LA PRENSA 
in Spanish 3 Jan 94 p 5) 
  Hugo Noe Pino, Central Bank of Honduras president-elect, has 
said the Honduran fiscal deficit is above 6 percent. He also 
said Rafael Callejas' administration could not reduce the 
deficit to the promised 3.8 percent. He added there is a $500 
million trade deficit. President-elect Carlos Reina has promised 
to reduce the fiscal deficit to less than 3 percent. Meanwhile, 
official sources indicate the fiscal deficit reached 5.9 
percent. Rene Ardon Matute, finance and public credit minister, 
said foreign debt estimates amount to $3 billion. (Panama City 
ACAN in Spanish 1520 GMT 4 Jan 94) 
  Economy Minister Carlos Chain has announced the fuel market 
was deregulated on 8 January. The business sector received the 
announcement with satisfaction, while consumers received it with 
concern. Chain said: "We are the first Central American country 
to deregulate fuel prices." He added that the government expects 
fuel companies to compete and offer consumers better prices 
instead of colluding to organize a monopoly. Honduras spends 
$190 million on fuel annually and depends entirely on imports to 
meet local demands. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1728 GMT 6 Jan 
94) 
  Official sources reported that in 1993 Honduran monetary 
reserves dropped to $9 million, which is a 64-percent decrease 
from 1992. This figure adds to the already bad economic 
indicators. The 1993 fiscal deficit closed at almost 7 percent, 
and the balance of payments showed a $500 million deficit.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 11 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Last night Central Bank President Evenor Taboada disclosed 
Nicaragua closed 1993 with a deficit of more than $50 million in 
its international reserves. Taboada reported the country's 
current total gross reserves amount to approximately $100 
million -- in other words, $50 million less than what is 
necessary to have a financially acceptable economy. 
  In addition, the Central Bank president conceded the 
government sold 74,476 troy ounces of solid gold, which resulted 
in $28.255 million in revenues. Taboada described as "completely 
baseless," however, Ramiro Gurdian's, Higher Council of Private 
Enterprise president, remarks, who said such a transaction was 
proof the government "is broke." He also rejected Gurdian's 
remarks that the gold was sold to pay debts to creditors. 
Taboada added the country still has 13,000 troy ounces, 
equivalent to 20 percent of Nicaragua's average annual 
production. (Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 4 Jan 94 pp 1, 8) 
  According to Central Bank figures, the alarming unemployment 
rate grew by approximately six points thereby affecting 71.3 
percent of the labor population in Nicaragua. Some 275,000 
individuals in an economically active population of 
approximately 1.4 million do not have jobs. In addition, 707,000 
are underemployed as they hold no formal jobs. The report 
attributes the unemployment increase to the incorporation of 
68,120 people into the so-called economically active population, 
as well as to a 0.72 percent drop in the country's economic 
activity. In Nicaragua, 70 percent of its 4 million people live 
in poverty. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1651 GMT 4 Jan 94) 
  In 1993, Nicaragua registered the highest inflation rate in 
Central America. Prices for goods and services increased 19.25 
percent in 1993. According to official figures, the cost of 
living in other Central American countries went up an average of 
11 percent, with Costa Rica having the lowest figure with an 
annual increase of 9.05 percent. 
  A Central Bank report revealed that housing, transportation, 
and communications were the areas with the highest price 
increases. The government had estimated the year would close 
with an inflation rate of less than 10 percent. Also, the 
Central Bank added currency devaluation was 25.83 percent in 
1993, and the price of the basic basket went up by 17.61. 
  Nicaraguan economic activity was characterized by recession, 
a significant lack of liquidity in enterprises, high interest 
rates, and a large reduction in internal demand levels. The 
Central Bank admitted the measures implemented in early 1993, 
when a 20-percent devaluation was applied followed by an annual 
5-percent drop, "has unfortunately had a negative effect" on 
economic activity. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1822 GMT 6 
Jan 94) 
  Danish Foreign Cooperation Minister Helle Degn announced 
Denmark will grant Nicaragua $100 million in aid during the 
1994-98 period. In addition, Denmark will open an embassy in 
Managua this year. On the second day of her official visit to 
Nicaragua, Degn informed President Violeta Chamorro of this 
decision in the presence of her Nicaraguan counterpart Erwin 
Kruger, with whom she signed a mutual cooperation protocol.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Salvador Perez Aleman, member of the Managua </F>
Department Sandinist Assembly] 
  [Text] A recent Sandinist departmental assembly began 
debating the reorganization of the FSLN [Sandinist National 
Liberation Front] in Managua. I would like to make a few remarks 
that could serve as a backdrop to the discussion about the 
reorganization of the FSLN now that it has approved by consensus 
the constitutional reforms for holding talks with UNO [National 
Opposition Union] and the government. 
  First of all, we must have a clear idea of the kind of 
Sandinism that we want to organize. Sandinism is a broad 
political front based on a revolutionary identity inherited from 
our Heroes and Martyrs. We are patriots by calling and we 
identify with the people because we are for social justice and 
equitable national development that benefits all sectors. 
  We often hear people say: "I am a Sandinist but I do not 
agree with this or that form of political action" or "I would 
like to be involved this way." Sandinism is a party to which 
people from all segments of society belong or with which they 
identify, but this does not mean that there does not exist a 
strong detachment of proven, reliable leaders. 
  Second, besides having a wide range of members, the FSLN 
uses 
methods of action that represent national, institutional, local, 
sectorial, economic, trade-union, labor-union, humanitarian, 
etc., interests. 
<H5>  A Vehicle for Leadership </H5>
  In each one of these struggles there are Sandinists who from 
the rank and file lend it a combative, democratic, grass-roots 
character. A reorganization must take into account this fact. 
The FSLN has to be reorganized in a versatile manner. 
  The FSLN's devotion to the people and its potential for 
governing oblige us to maintain smooth communications with 
sectors that in keeping with our philosophy represent our 
natural social base but that for various reasons have drifted 
away from Sandinism: peasants from the highlands, ethnic groups, 
young people, merchants, housewives, etc. 
  The reorganization of leadership, intermediate, and 
rank-and-file structures must take into account the various 
manifestations of Sandinism, and we must clearly realize that 
these structures are vehicles for facilitating the exercise of 
leadership and achieving the objectives of the various struggles. 
  We must bring about a revolution in opportunities for all 
Sandinists and for the people in general, by expanding them for 
those who already have them and by creating them for those who 
do not (the unemployed, the illiterate, discrimination victims, 
etc.). 
  National structures and local or sectorial leaders must 
further Sandinist influence without blocking the ideas of the 
rank and file, by combining individual initiative and creativity 
with democratic consensus. 
  I lean towards a coordinating structure that does not 
centralize decision-making, that combines experience with youth; 
towards a social movement with comprehensive political 
leadership and equality between men and women; one that 
moderates rather than coerces; one that is more representative 
of the social sectors than of nonfunctional structures; one that 
promotes debate and organizes compliance with resolutions. 
  Among the rank and file we would set up regional, sectorial, 
interest-group, or trade-union Sandinist assemblies with 
executive committees. The plenum of such Sandinist assemblies 
would be organized openly and broadly to serve as a conduit for 
party life and would listen to individual and group opinions and 
eventually forge a single collective thought. 
  The rank-and-file Sandinist assembly would meet at least 
twice a year to make decisions. As for daily political work, 
action would be taken by economic unit, trade union, social 
sector, project, commission, symposium, or any other form of 
organization. 
<H5>  Scope and Rank-and-File Debate </H5>
  The primary goal is to bring the people together to defend 
their interests, to promote the comprehensive development of 
society and the country, and to seek power in order to achieve 
our political objectives. 
  A prerequisite for a successful reorganization of the FSLN 
is 
to abolish the difference between activist [militante] and 
member [afiliado]. Under the current conditions of thorough FSLN 
democratization there ought to be equal opportunities, duties, 
and rights for all who are part of the Sandinist party 
organization. 
  Even before the 1996 election campaign I would like to 
support the idea of establishing minimum channels for partisan 
political communication among Sandinists in electoral precincts. 
Ultimately, it is at the ballot box that the party demonstrates 
the organizational, political, and ideological strength and 
depth that it possesses to implement its program for the people. 
  The FSLN must embody most of the interests and just 
struggles 
of the people. This mean supporting and making room for the 
emerging sectors of society, especially the ones that wave 
patriotic, revolutionary, and grass-roots banners. 
  This open debate must be carried to all Sandinists without 
party membership cards as a first step towards reincorporating 
them, reorganizing ourselves, and heading down the road to 
electoral victory with an FSLN that is united amid its well 
known diversity.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 12 Jan (NA) -- A top-ranking meeting 
held at the Olivos residence this evening to assess security 
conditions in the interior of the country concluded that "there 
are no possibilities in sight for social outbursts or outbreaks 
of guerrilla activities," an official source has said. 
  The meeting, summoned by President Carlos Menem, was 
attended 
by Defense Minister Oscar Camilion, Interior Minister Carlos 
Ruckauf, the chiefs of staff of the three branches of the Armed 
Forces, and Division General Mario Diaz, the chief of the Joint 
Staff. 
  The meeting was also attended by Presidency Secretary 
General 
Eduardo Bauza, SIDE [Secretariat for State Intelligence] chief 
Hugo Anzorreguy, Deputy Miguel Angel Toma, and Senator Eduardo 
Menem. 
  The meeting analyzed the situation in Santiago del Estero 
and 
La Rioja, and studied a report submitted by Jorge Busti, 
minister of government in the cabinet under the Federal 
Government trustee in Santiago del Estero, who described the 
social situation in this province. 
  According to the source, the report stated that social 
conditions are now "totally different from those prevailing at 
the end of December." 
  Concerning La Rioja, the possibility of a missile attack 
against the presidential plane on 30 December -- which had been 
mentioned by a press report -- was "totally ruled out." 
  The SIDE chief mentioned the information gathered by his 
sector on the social situation in the provinces. He ruled out 
"any reaction like that which is happening in Mexico," the 
source said. 
  In brief statements made upon leaving the Olivos residence, 
Camilion and Ruckauf said "there are no indications of possible 
social outbursts in the northern provinces," adding that "the 
situation in those provinces is under control." 
  The meeting was called for by Menem in light of the reports 
of an attack against him and the reports -- which were also 
denied -- of the presence of Argentine guerrillas in Mexico. 
  Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo today denied having 
compared 
the crisis in Santiago and the situation in Mexico, despite the 
fact that almost all local publications made this interpretation 
of the words he had uttered 24 hours before at the Finance 
Ministry.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 12 Jan (NA) -- Foreign Ministry 
Secretary General Andres Cisneros today denied that Argentina's 
position regarding the Malvinas Islands is a weak one, but he 
did admit that it is overshadowed by the fact that "a war was 
lost," and that "he who is now unlawfully in possession of them 
has, in fact, the power to do and undo due to the power invested 
in weapons." 
  Cisneros made it clear that the official Malvinas policy is 
not set by the Foreign Ministry, but "by President Carlos Menem 
himself." 
  He said: "There are only three ways in which to recover the 
lost territories: to demand them by right, war, or through 
negotiations," and he justified the use of the last alternative 
because to "insist only on the judicial factor is not enough to 
recover the islands because the world organization does not have 
an institution that can award what each country has a right to." 
  In remarks to a radio station, Cisneros said that with this 
type of claim, which he considered "very dignified and very 
correct for these times, we have the reason but not the islands. 
There are two ways for a right to become a reality: war or 
negotiation, there are no others. We already know what the 
results of a war are with Great Britain; therefore, only 
negotiation remains." 
  Regarding the attempts to change the attitude of the Kelpers 
[preceding word in English] regarding Argentina, Cisneros said: 
"It is not a question of seducing them to deceive them or 
attract them with fantastic promises." 
  He stated that there are two very distinct attitudes 
regarding the Malvinas, and one of them "has lasted for 160 
years and it is the hostile attitude based on the premise that 
if the islanders always get the short end of the stick, 
Argentina will always be better off." 
  Cisneros indicated that instead this government believes the 
better way "is everything to the contrary, and that as we 
establish links of mutual interest they will begin to understand 
that the only way they have to exploit their notable raw 
materials is through cooperation with the only neighbor in the 
world that God has given them." 
  He mentioned that the fact that the British Government is 
investigating alleged war crimes by its soldiers and that 
Argentina has offered to clear up the mine fields are among the 
achievements that have helped the rapprochement between the two 
nations. 
  Finally, he stressed that for some time now "millions of 
Argentines" have had two passports and can now visit the 
islands, and "this is a very important first step toward 
unfreezing relations with the islanders."

  [Text] La Paz, 3 Dec (Jatha)--The Armed Forces asserted 
today that the organization "Vivid Red" [Rojo Vivo] does not 
belong to the military, indicating that the pamphlets that are 
circulating about the group's existence come from people who are 
trying to cause unrest in the ranks. 
  Military authorities agreed that the group has not achieved 
its goal because the armed services are made up of brave men who 
can bring up any issue. 
  Both Defense Minister Antonio Cespedes and the military 
chiefs indicated that it has not yet been determined whether 
"Vivid Red" is a group or a single individual who has been 
issuing a series of pamphlets in an attempt to create unrest in 
the Armed Forces. 
  Cespedes indicated that the Armed Forces cannot waste time 
trying to determine whether it is a group or an individual 
because they have more important things to do. 
  The commander in chief of the Armed Forces, General Fernando 
Sanjines, said that this is not the first time that walls have 
been painted and pamphlets have been distributed in a bid to 
tarnish the military's image. 
  "These sorts of actions by people who are trying to create 
unrest in the Armed Forces will not have the desired effect 
because military personnel do not accept the publication of 
anonymous messages," he added. 
  He cautioned that if the people who are putting out the 
pamphlets are identified, they would be punished in accordance 
with the provisions of the Organic Law of the Armed Forces and 
the Code of Military Penal Procedure.

  [Text] The chief of staff of the Armed Forces High Command, 
General Moises Shriqui, acknowledged yesterday that the group 
that calls itself "Vivid Red" does in fact exist within the 
military. In recent days the group has circulated pamphlets 
denouncing the high commands and demanding greater attention to 
military requirements. 
  He said that the organization, which is apparently made up 
mainly of midranking officers and noncoms, has been operating 
for some time, despite which the direct superiors have been 
unable to identify its members, who in many instances have been 
denouncing a series of alleged irregularities in the running of 
the military. 
  "`Vivid Red' is an underground group in the Armed Forces. 
Unfortunately, we have not been able to discover anything about 
these pamphlets that are coming out periodically. There could be 
two or three people, but they cannot be identified, inasmuch as 
a single person could put out a series of anonymous pamphlets," 
the chief of staff of the high command asserted. 
  He attributed its existence to the heterogeneous makeup of 
the Armed Forces and to the discontent among some of its 
members. "Ours is a large institution. Not everybody can be in 
agreement with the things that happen in any command or any 
unit," General Shriqui said, adding that "they have to be 
military personnel because they are very well informed about the 
things that are going on." 
<H5>  Commander in Chief </H5>
  When asked about the same issue, the commander in chief of 
the Armed Forces, General Fernando Sanjines, indicated that 
because of the annoyance that the pamphlets circulating 
periodically are causing among servicemen, Department II of 
military intelligence is investigating the matter. 
  "We are doing the appropriate follow-up," he said, noting 
that "they are anonymous, and we should not attach importance to 
an insignificant issue." 
  Defense Minister Antonio Cespedes made a similar remark, 
asserting that "the only thing I am familiar with is the 
pamphlet that I read once, but I do not attach any importance to 
it and it should not be taken into account."

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister-designate German Correa by </F>
Raquel Correa; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [EL MERCURIO] Why did 
[President-elect Eduardo] Frei choose you for the cabinet's most 
important position? 
  [Correa] He should answer that question, but he told me he 
thought it was a gesture on the part of the state -- a gesture 
for the future -- to offer the most important portfolio to a 
Socialist. He said this will erase the ghosts of the past, 
putting a definitive end to "banned" areas. He said the fact 
that a Socialist -- who is currently the president of the party 
-- was chosen for that the post reflects the maturity of our 
democracy. Second, because he recognized my personal qualities, 
my ability, and the experience I acquired in the cabinet of 
President Patricio Aylwin. Generation factors also played a 
role: Two men of the new political generation beginning a new 
phase in the consolidation of our democracy. 
  [EL MERCURIO] Malicious people have said it is a way to keep 
the Socialists totally tied to the coalition and to the 
government. 
  [Correa] There is no room for such malicious thoughts. To be 
strong, a coalition like ours needs to share the 
responsibilities of the government. And this must be done for 
better or for worse. That is part of government work. It is not 
a matter of burning either the Socialists or me, but of sharing 
the responsibility for all the good and the bad the next 
government may do. 
  [EL MERCURIO] Did the Socialists want the interior 
portfolio? 
  [Correa] Not at all. Our political analysts believed it 
would be politically unfeasible. A Christian Democratic Party 
member would have been the most obvious choice for the post, 
which is so close to the president and is so trusted by him. It 
was a surprise for my party. I frankly wanted to continue to 
lead my party, but when the president repeatedly offered the 
most important post... Had it been any of the other 20 
ministerial posts, I would have continued to say no. But this 
is a historic step, an extraordinarily important, symbolic and 
political gesture. I had to properly appraise it, and so did 
the party. [passage omitted] 
  [EL MERCURIO] This ministry is in charge of public security, 
and as such is in charge of repression. 
  [Correa] This ministry is responsible for both public 
security and the immense task of regionalization and 
decentralization of the country, which must be set in motion now. 
  [EL MERCURIO] Will you suggest to Frei names for mayors and 
governors? 
  [Correa] Of course. As of 2 January, part of my job is to 
help the president-elect create his team of under secretaries, 
governors, and to fill the other public posts. 
  [EL MERCURIO] Will you do it with a calculator, counting the 
votes of each party? 
  [Correa] No. I believe political factors are much more 
important for cabinets, which rely on their political support. 
  [EL MERCURIO] The next cabinet is criticized for being more 
political than technical. 
  [Correa] Genaro Arriagada has publicly said that this will 
be 
a highly political cabinet for which excellence will also be 
taken into account. Excellence also applies to politicians. 
The designation of some politicians to technical portfolios was 
strongly criticized a few days ago. Yet I believe we did 
nothing wrong. [passage omitted] 
  [EL MERCURIO] You said you will have photographs of Frei, 
Aylwin, and Allende in your office. Which would you prefer in 
the presidential chair? 
  [Correa] Salvador Allende, without doubt, so that he could 
complete, within a different context, the dream we started in 
1970; the dream that was thwarted by the convulsed reality in 
the country due to our mistakes and the great national and 
international plots. 
  [EL MERCURIO] You mean the dream of leading the country 
towards a socialist system? 
  [Correa] But a socialist system designed for Chile, with a 
lot of democracy and freedom, which Allende had in mind. I 
think many socialists at that time did not understand the 
socialism Allende offered. 
  [EL MERCURIO] Do you aspire to materialize that dream or is 
it something of the past...? 
  [Correa] The dream is unchanged. The form of expression, 
however, is quite different. It is a very democratic, very 
libertarian, participative, and very fair socialism. We will 
always aspire to achieve Allende's dream. He was unable to 
achieve it, but... 
  [EL MERCURIO] It was a socialism against market freedom, 
private property, which promoted expropriations... 
  [Correa] Precisely... We are suffering the consequences of 
those mistakes. [passage omitted] 
  [EL MERCURIO] Will yours be a hard or soft policy? 
  [Correa] A democratic policy. Fully respecting human rights 
and the peoples' dignity as well as the institutions in charge 
of safeguarding public order that risk their lives to do their 
job. Speaking frankly, we will promote the necessary changes 
regarding procedures and training of the Investigative Police 
and the Carabineros. We must continue the great task started by 
President Patricio Aylwin's government. 
  [EL MERCURIO] Will the Investigative Police and Carabineros 
be placed under the Interior Ministry? 
  [Correa] From the political and congressional viewpoint, 
that 
might not be feasible, but I will make every effort to achieve a 
consensus with the opposition that will allow us to progress in 
that direction. There are several reasons against this and we 
must assess them carefully. This issue involves matters related 
to the public order policy and also very legitimate issues such 
as belonging to certain social security plans, being linked to 
other Armed Forces' branches. There are all sorts of symbolic 
aspects to be taken into account. It will be my duty, when we 
tackle this issue, to take all these aspects into account. 
[passage omitted] 
  [EL MERCURIO] How can you guarantee public order if you were 
involved in disrupting it? 
  [Correa] Well... That was when the country was ruled by a 
government that was not elected sovereignly by the people 
through free and informed elections; by a regime that 
systematically violated human rights; which imposed itself by 
force. Therefore, it was legitimate to fight against this 
illegal government. I would do so again if the country faced a 
similar situation again. We now live in democracy, in a state 
of law, with all its faults. I promote democratic means of 
struggle which excludes the use of armed violence. 
  [EL MERCURIO] Had you been interior minister last 11 
September, would you have authorized the demonstration by 
extreme leftists at La Moneda on the anniversary of Allende's 
death? 
  [Correa] Yes. I did not agree with the mayor's decision. By 
authorizing the demonstration he could have reached direct 
agreement with the leaders, thus preventing violent 
demonstrations. Minor groups willing to unleash violence use 
the excuse of a ban like that to exercise violence, as was the 
case that day. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Defense Minister-designate Edmundo Perez Yoma 
stated on 26 December that the reform of the constitutional 
article that establishes the unremovability of the Armed Forces 
commander in chief is not a priority. 
  Perez Yoma made this remark to a television station. 
  He indicated that it is a question of principles because the 
coalition [Coalition of Parties for Democracy] believes the 
Armed Forces' leadership must be subordinate to civilian 
authorities. But he stated that this type of reform needs a 
broad consensus, and therefore he believes there will be no 
action on the topic in the short term. 
  Perez Yoma said the topic "is neither first nor a priority," 
although he expressed his hope that "we can convince the rest of 
the Chilean people and the Armed Forces" that the power to 
remove the commander in chief must be returned to the president.

<F P=106> [Report by Carmen Castro] </F>
  [Text] The Chilean Government has asked the Peruvian 
Government to apply appropriate norms in the case of Chilean 
terrorists sentenced to life imprisonment in Peru. 
  The Chilean Government seeks the application of appropriate 
norms in the case of three Chileans sentenced to life 
imprisonment in Peru. This was stated by Chilean Foreign 
Ministry spokesmen. 
  The Chilean Government considers unapplicable the norms and 
jurisdiction of the Peruvian courts that sentenced the Chileans 
for the crime of treason to the motherland, a crime valid only 
for Peruvians. The defendants are Chilean citizens; therefore, 
they cannot be the object of such an accusation, the ministry 
spokesmen said. 
  The Chilean Government wants them tried by a Peruvian 
civilian court for the crimes they committed even if they again 
receive prison sentences if their guilt in participating in 
terrorist actions is demonstrated. These Chileans are connected 
with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Army. 
  The Chilean Government does not oppose a trial but it wants 
the application of appropriate norms and procedures according to 
international law. 
  The trial that took place last week in Lima violated the 
law, 
given that after the defendants were notified of their charges, 
they were given only 24 hours to present their defense. The 
sentence was issued within the same time span, which is 
unacceptable. 
  The defendants' relatives also said the detained were 
mistreated and isolated. They were even sentenced to life 
imprisonment by faceless judges. 
  Several norms were violated, such as the fact that the 
defense did not have enough means and time. The law establishing 
that witnesses for the prosecution and the defense must testify 
under the same conditions was not respected. The four Chileans 
involved in this case were questioned on 14 October without 
respecting these conditions. 
  In the face of these juridical violations, the Chilean 
Foreign Ministry asked the Peruvian Government for the 
appropriate application of justice. The Peruvian Government has 
not given an official answer to the Chilean Government yet.

  [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 12 Jan, CANA -- The benefits 
to be derived and the implications for Caribbean Community 
(Caricom) countries if they obtain equal treatment under the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will be high on the 
agenda of an international meeting here later this month. 
  In an interview with CANA, Mary Mahabir, a member of the 
conference's organising committee, said the January 24-25 
conference will "explore the issues, options, legal aspects, and 
implications of obtaining parity for Barbados and the other 
Caricom countries". 
  "Because of the emerging trends in international trading, 
Caricom and the wider Caribbean will have to align itself with 
some trading bloc, whether it be NAFTA, or the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) arrangement," Mahabir told CANA. 
  "If Caricom countries are granted parity under NAFTA, 
essentially what this means is that they will be opening up 
their markets and entering in new trading arrangements.... We 
therefore want to look at the implications of this on Caribbean 
economies, our manufacturing sectors, our labour relations and 
so on," she said. 
  "Therefore the issue of parity for Caribbean states will be 
assessed ... so we can look and see whether the disadvantages 
in gaining this NAFTA parity will seriously outweigh the 
advantages to be derived and vice versa," the attorney-at-law 
remarked. 
  Caricom countries are lobbying to secure a parity 
arrangement under NAFTA, in order to gain better access to North 
American markets for their goods, especially garments and 
textiles. 
  Mahabir said the conference was also created to "better 
educate" the region's people about the issue. 
  "Most people are aware of the broad concept of NAFTA ... 
that it is a free trade agreement ... but they are not 
familiar with or aware of the intricacies or the legal aspects 
of it. 
  "So we are hoping to publish a book on the papers that will 
be presented ... and then circulate it to make people more 
aware of what NAFTA and the parity arrangement will be all 
about," Mahabir said. 
  Representatives from the United States, Canada, and the 
Caricom grouping are expected to attend the conference. 
  They will present papers on topics including "The Overview 
of NAFTA and Its Implications for the Hemisphere and the World 
Trading System," and "Market Access: Tariffs, Customs 
Procedures, and Drawbacks". 
  The meeting is being sponsored by the International Fiscal 
Institute (IFA). The institute is headquartered in Rotterdam, 
Holland, and has several branches worldwide. 
  The IFA has a mandate to host seminars and conferences to 
explore issues of international importance, especially 
financing, trading and tax-related matters.

  [Text] The Mobilization for National Development [MDN] 
party invites the UN Security Council and the countries called 
Friends of Haiti to commit themselves, alongside President 
Clinton, to the definitive closing of the Aristide file. 
Reacting to the U.S. President's latest statements reported by 
THE NEW YORK TIMES on 6 January, Professor Hubert De Ronceray 
congratulates himself on the fact that the State Department 
could finally admit to President Aristide's psychological 
instability. In any case, the MDN leader requires a type of 
relations more in conformity with the requirements of the 
international community's new world economic order. 
  [Begin De Ronceray recording] The MDN deems President 
Clinton's decision to reconsider the Haitian file, in light of 
facts accumulated over the past two years, realistic and 
encouraging. The U.S. Administration's open-mindedness must 
correspond with Haiti's political willingness in order to manage 
and harmonize the requirements of national reconciliation with 
the new international power struggles. In this respect, the 
Haitian people consider themselves entitled to expect from the 
United Nations, the OAS, and the four countries called the 
Friends of Haiti a type of relations more concerned with 
effective solidarity and more in conformity with the 
requirements of a new international economic order. 
  MDN invites the UN Security Council, the OAS, Venezuela, 
France, and Canada to commit themselves, alongside President 
Clinton, to the definitive closing of the Aristide file which is 
too heavy with incoherence, violence, destruction, human rights 
violations, and calls for foreign military invasion. [end

  [Text] On the national level, the news is the announcement

humanitarian fuel shipment. 
  First, there was the announcement last week by American 
Ambassador Lawrence Pezzullo, special delegate on the Haitian 
crisis of the U.S. secretary of state, of the arrival of the 
humanitarian oil shipment for 12 January. The United States then 
announced at the last minute, on 11 January, the postponement of 
the shipment, with no explanation. 
  This morning, an OAS spokesman made an announcement to the 
contrary. There is therefore confusion on the arrival of the 
shipment.

  [Text] Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, 12 Jan, CANA -- The 
Trinidad and Tobago Government will issue new passports from the 
beginning of next month to combat passport fraud. 
  "In 1993 alone, over 300 cases of passport fraud came to our 
attention and for the first ten days of 1994, 18 cases have been 
reported, " Chief Immigration Officer Arthur Harper told 
reporters on Wednesday. 
  Harper said passports were being stolen to get the United 
States visas which were then inserted into a fradulent passport 
and sold to members of the public for as high as 10,000 Trinidad 
and Tobago dollars (one TT dollar - 17.5 US cents). 
  The Immigration chief said the passports which were being 
printed by a firm in the United Kingdom, had a number of 
built-in security features and were virtually tamper-proof. 
  Persons over 16 years old who have never owned a passport or 
whose passport has expired will have to pay 150 dollars while 
persons under 16 years would have to pay 75 dollars. 
  The holders of unexpired passports who are over 16 years 
will be required to pay 100 dollars for the new passport and 
persons under 16 years will pay 50 dollars. 
  Harper said all passports issued before Immigration started 
handing out the new ones will be declared null and void on June 
30, 1995.

  [Text] Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings expressed his 
appreciation for the support Cuba has provided to his country 
and sent a message of solidarity to the Cuban people. During his 
meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Rawlings 
stated that his government still has much to do for Cuba because 
somehow they must express their appreciation for all that Cuba 
has done for Africa. 
  Robaina, on the other hand, delivered a message to Rawlings 
from Cuban President Fidel Castro, and described the statements 
by the Ghanaian leader as a reflection of the historic relations 
between the two states. Robaina expressed appreciation for 
Ghana's position on such issues as the U.S. blockade of Cuba and 
human rights. After stating that 1993 had been the most 
difficult year in the history of the Cuban Revolution, Robaina 
predicted that 1994 would be the beginning of an ascending 
spiral for the Cuban people. 
  Robaina concluded his official two-day visit to Ghana as 
part 
of a tour of five African countries. Today, Robaina is in 
Luanda, Angola.

<F P=106> [Final part of "nonbroadcast portion" of interview with </F>
Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National Assembly 
of the People's Government, ANPP, by reporters Julio Batista and 
Rosa Maria Godoy on the "I Have an Opinion" program, on 10 
January in Havana -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Batista] Then, you do believe that because of this 
situation you have been explaining regarding the complex 
problems the country, the government, and the National Assembly 
[ANPP] have to confront....[changes thought] Do you believe that 
in the current conditions we are experiencing, all these 
difficulties, problems, and efforts bring the voters closer to 
the parliamentary system or alienate them? 
  [Alarcon] I believe it brings them closer and has to do so 
more each day. Unfortunately, in this world where interrelations 
are growing, models are transposed, and concepts and 
preconceptions are disseminated by the movies and other means of 
mass media communication, many times when one thinks of a 
parliament, what comes to mind is some gentleman giving an 
address, or a group of people who debate issues, talk, are 
experienced in rhetoric, are persuasive, etc. This is purely a 
formal aspect, and I would add adjectival aspect, of what a 
parliament should be from the socialist or people's point of 
view. 
  This is why I insist in calling it a system of the people's 
government, because the key is precisely to attain, as much as 
possible, the people's direct participation in their government. 
This is why out there some people still speak of the so-called 
representative democracy, which is a fiction because it limits 
the actual role of the people the moment they elect a 
representative to congress or a parliament. Many times, as you 
know, the one who wins the election is the one who has the 
greatest financial resources, the one who can afford television 
advertising, the one who can buy votes; in the end, the one who 
has the most power. How many times are the people part of the 
work of that legislator? How many times do the people have 
anything to do with what the legislator does? They see their 
legislator on television giving an occasional address or hear 
from him during an electoral campaign. 
  In our case, we seek, have to seek, and can achieve, 
precisely because of the characteristics of our society, making 
the relationship between the voters and their government or 
parliamentary system as constant as possible, as daily as 
possible, as real and natural as possible. I believe that this 
is possible -- pardon the redundancy. It is possible in a true 
socialism and it is impossible in other societies. 
  [Batista] I would like to discuss the issue of the 
forthcoming union meetings. You were saying that the delegates 
have been asked to get involved in these meetings, to be 
present. They are going to be very busy. Many people wonder, 
because they see that the ANPP meets twice a year for two days 
of work at the Convention Center. However, our delegates are not 
professionals; they are comrades who have other jobs. With this 
I want to say that our people have to understand that that 
delegate is a working individual and that the ANPP works all 
year long. I would like you to expand on this. 
  [Alarcon] I believe that what you say is true. Many examples 
could be given, such as when the ANPP discussed the issue of 
energy on June. Prior to this, we had created a special 
committee to oversee that issue. This committee organized a 
series of nationwide activities, not only the meetings it held 
as a committee -- the member delegates of that committee -- but 
an entire program of meetings of the provincial and municipal 
assemblies, and also at the People's Council level. Among their 
activities nationwide -- not every deputy visited every site -- 
they visited various production centers and major institutions 
involved with the issue of energy. They held a total of 8,081 
visits where they met with workers, enterprise managers, 
technicians, etc., to discuss local energy problems. Figure out 
how many hours, how many work days those delegates spent on this 
issue before the ANPP spent one work day on its discussion. I 
believe that, in terms of man-hours, it is more than any 
discussion on any issue by any parliament in the world. 
  [Batista] There is one thing that worries me. You have been 
explaining, as did Pedro Ross, that we need these debates on 
economic problems. What level of information are the masses, the 
workers going to receive about the main aspects to be discussed? 
Or are they going to find out at the time of the meeting? Is 
there a plan to begin to disseminate information to the people 
on the main issues to be discussed? How is this going to be 
carried out? 
  [Alarcon] The comrades of the labor movement are preparing 
to 
organize this program from their perspective. We believe that it 
is important for each of these debates to be accompanied or 
preceded by information presented by their respective 
leaderships: in other words, a series of facts or opinions by 
the leaders at each work center, which should be explained to 
the workers, logically, prior to the beginning of the process of 
assembly. This is a very specific, locally oriented effort. 
There are going to be tens of thousands of these meetings. 
However, they should be properly organized. We have insisted on 
this to the delegates. It is not a matter of meeting for the 
sake of meeting but to prepare the meeting well, adequately to 
collect the information and necessary data so that everyone has 
a better chance to understand the specific situation they are 
going to debate. 
  [Godoy] Has a date been set for the special meeting of the 
ANPP to continue discussion of the national finance situation? 
  [Alarcon] The response is short: Not yet. [laughter] 
  [Batista] Finally: At times one reads in the newspapers and 
hears in the radio that 1993 was the worst year of the special 
period. Does this means that 1994 will be better? What is your 
opinion? 
  [Alarcon] I believe we should make every effort to ensure 
that 1993 keeps its title in history as the worst year, the most 
difficult we have ever confronted. I believe that it lies within 
us, with the exception of natural calamities or unforeseen 
events. We live in a world full of new and unpredictable 
problems; but assuming that nothing extraordinary of a natural 
or manmade nature occurs, we are able to affirm that beginning 
with 1994, modestly, step by step, without spectacular results, 
we will be able to reverse the situation Cuba has been facing. 
  I believe that there are many fields in which this is 
possible. Once again I must mention the sugarcane harvest. It is 
possible to achieve a more efficient harvest through the 
committed efforts of all those involved in this activity and 
everyone not directly involved but who can support it. There is 
the whole movement of the sugarcane and nonsugarcane farming 
cooperatives and the entire effort to increase food and cane 
production through them. There are also efforts to reduce the 
budget deficit, the subsidies that these sectors receive, and 
thereby to help heal our national finances. This is another 
specific example. There are also prospects in other sectors in 
which the Cuba is making progress, such as tourism which is 
growing at a faster rate than that seen in other countries 
catering to tourism. In other words, there are real 
possibilities within our reach. 
  However, the key to ensuring that 1994 will be better lies 
in 
our will to achieve this and in everyone's capacity to organize 
and channel that will. I believe that we have returned to the 
same theme, the underlying theme, the core issue of our entire 
conversation. The key lies in organizing and channeling the 
collective effort of the people in specific and general terms in 
each place; the trust in that people, which has provided 
abundant proof of its capacity to resist. I am convinced that 
when the end of 1994 approaches, we will be able to look back 
and see that through our efforts we are effectively overcoming 
the crisis.

  [Text] The so-called Workers Parliament began today at the 
Miguel Fernandez Tobacco Factory, formerly known as La Corona, 
in Havana City. In these assemblies, everyone has the 
opportunity to give his opinion on different aspects of our 
economy and finances. Juan Bautista, a worker at this factory, 
answered questions asked by our reporter, Roberto Cavada. 
  [Cavada] One of the topics that came up in this assembly, 
which has been called the Workers Parliament, today here in the 
Miguel Fernandez Tobacco Factory was the issue of whether money 
of dubious origin, accumulated in great quantities by small 
sectors of the population, should be confiscated. I was very 
interested in the opinion that Juan Bautista expressed to the 
rest of his comrades and I have asked him to express that 
opinion for the rest of the Cuban people. What is your opinion, 
Juan? 
  [Bautista] We believe that this money of dubious origin 
should be confiscated, especially since the money was obtained 
illegally and by exploiting the needs of the workers due to the 
situation that the country is currently facing. 
  [Cavada] How would you determine who obtained it through 
dubious means and who obtained it through legal means and hard 
work? 
  [Bautista] This is simple. No worker can have 200,000 pesos 
stashed in the bank or in his home. 
  [Cavada] Another of the questions that was asked today in 
your factory and which was debated by the workers concerned the 
price policy [politica de precio] that the country should 
follow. What is your opinion? 
  [Bautista] Marx established that the principle of 
socialistic 
distribution was not entirely fair but that it was the only 
principle realistically applicable to socialism. In other words, 
everyone should contribute according to his capacity and receive 
according to his work. The price policy would fulfill this 
principle of distribution that applies and should apply in 
socialism. Each person should contribute to society according to 
his capacity and should receive according to his work. This 
principle should allow him to have access to determined products 
that could be offered. 
  [Cavada] Juan, in a nutshell, as an old tobacco worker, how 
do you think the state can confront the excess of currency and 
restructure the economy? 
  [Bautista] I believe the way to confront the excess of 
currency is by increasing production. At the moment, we must 
take steps to overcome the situation; in other words, find an 
equilibrium between the amount of currency and the amount of 
goods available. The definite solution to this problem is to 
increase production and the efficiency of our enterprises. I 
believe one of the topics that was analyzed at the assembly was 
subsidies to the enterprises. I believe inefficient enterprises 
should not be subsidized. I believe every enterprise director, 
together with the labor union and the rest of the organizations, 
should find the way for those enterprises to become efficient. 
  [Cavada] That is the opinion of Cuban workers. This is the 
case of Juan Bautista, an longtime tobacco worker, who continues 
to produce and give his opinion at the Miguel Fernandez Factory 
where today began what the Cuban Workers Federation has called 
the Workers Parliament.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 5 and 11 January. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 5 January reports that Holguin 
Province has begun 1994 with water levels in its reservoirs of 
slightly over 83 percent of potential, "one of the best 
situations in recent times, in this respect." 
  In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that the David Diaz 
Guardarrama Recapping Plant in Villa Clara delivered over 4,200 
recapped tires for harvest use in the provinces of Santa Clara, 
Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, and part of Matanzas. 
  Lastly, Rebelde reports that "ICAIC [Cuban Institute of 
Cinematographic Arts and Industry] is urging all inhabitants of 
Plaza de la Revolucion Municipality, Havana City Province, who 
are interested in participating" in the filming of a joint 
French-Cuban movie, to apply at its offices in the Vedado 
section of Havana. 
  Radio Reloj at 2050 GMT on 5 January reports that the 
Spanish 
consortium Caguama Caribbean Hotels has announced that by late 
1994 it plans to complete remodeling the Riviera Hotel in Havana 
in the hopes of making it a fine five-star hotel. Regarding the 
Caguama-Punta Blanca hotel, the group has announced that the 
remodeling work has begun. Ricardo Roquero, president of Caguama 
Caribbean Hotels, has confirmed that they chose the Caribbean, 
and Cuba in particular, because of the great potential and 
opportunities for investment. 
  Radio Reloj at 2052 GMT on 5 January reports that the Jose 
Gregorio Martinez factory in Cienfuegos repaired approximately 
400 hydraulic pumps used in the KTP sugar combines in 1993. The 
factory workers have said that they can repair 150 pumps a 
month. Last year workers were not able to produce the number of 
cylinders, hoses, and shock absorbers needed for agricultural 
equipment because they did not have the necessary raw materials. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 7 January quotes a GRANMA 
article today reporting that a total of 777 Basic Cooperative 
Production Units [UBPC's] were created nationwide in noncane 
agriculture in 1993. GRANMA notes that to-date, there are 62,215 
caballerias under UBPC jurisdiction and that slightly over 
78,000 workers have joined these units. According to data 
provided by the Agriculture Ministry, 407 of the 777 UBPC's tend 
cattle; 226, miscellaneous crops; 65, tobacco; 29, citrus 
plantations; 23, fish farms; 14, rice; 12, coffee; and one is a 
forestry unit. 
  Radio Reloj at 2049 GMT on 7 January reports that 
Tourhoteles 
Enterprise surpassed its foreign exchange income goal by 7 
percent in 1993. During the year, this enterprise was host to 
270,000 tourists from Mexico, Germany, Argentina, Italy, 
Guatemala, and Brazil. 
  Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 7 January reported that 
in 
1993, Havana City reached an infant mortality rate of 8.9 per 
1,000 live births, which is the lowest in its history. Villa 
Clara achieved the lowest rate in the country, 6.6. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 8 January reports that the 
Solidarity Cuba-France flight has donated $100,000 for GRANMA 
newspaper and other supplies. The French Communist Party senator 
stresses growth of the solidarity movement. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 11 January reports that the 
first line of tubes [tubos] earmarked for the manufacture of 
Cuban bicycles has begun continuous production in areas of the 
(Indalecio Montejo) factory in south Ciego de Avila City. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 11 January reports that the 
factory in Santa Cruz del Norte municipality, Havana Province, 
which makes cardboard of various weights -- the only such plant 
in Cuba -- will resume operations this month after an extensive 
period of inactivity due to the current economic limitations. 
The plant will process over 3,000 tons of cardboard of various 
weights with support from a Swedish-Venezuelan company, and will 
earmark this first shipment for the promotion of its products on 
the international market. "The Santa Cruz del Norte cardboard 
plant will use raw material acquired through foreign financing, 
which will allow us to make this plant part of the national 
strategy to bring in foreign currency." 
  Cuba Vision at 2330 GMT on 11 January reports that the first 
phase of the Palo Alto bulk sugar terminal in Ciego de Avila 
Province is near completion. The project, estimated at over 75 
million pesos, will increase efficiency in marketing the sugar 
produced by 17 nearby mills, as well as reduce transportation 
costs. The facility is designed to handle 750 tons of sugar per 
hour. Minaz and Micons workers affirm the first phase will be 
completed within the next few weeks. 
  Cuba Vision adds that the San Jose White china factory in 
Havana is operating in the black a few months after its 
inauguration. Ninety percent of the raw materials used by the 
factory are obtained in Cuba. The factory has already 
contributed $500,000 to the national economy. It has 140 workers 
and operates 24 hours a day. 
  Cuba Vision also reports that the workers of Varadero's 
Tuspan Hotel accrued $10 million in 1993, thereby fulfilling 
their pledge to Fidel Castro. This hotel is considered among the 
best in Cuba due to the quality of its service and its economic 
efficiency. The 230- room two-year-old hotel is a joint 
investment of Cubanacan and the Mexican group DSC, and is 
managed and marketed by the German enterprise LTI. The money 
earned is a significant contribution toward purchase of food and 
medicine for the people.

  [Excerpt] Daniel Espichan Tumay, the special prosecutor 
for terrorist crimes, on 3 January told EXPRESO that 1,500 
subversives have sought shelter so far under the Repentance Law. 
He added that most of them made this decision after the 
announcement of [Shining Path leader] Abimael Guzman's and the 
Shining Path leadership's call to lay down arms. 
  Espichan said: "Before Abimael's letters, we had recorded 
about 400 repented terrorists. After Abimael's letters, this 
number tripled." 
  Espichan noted that 780 Shining Path terrorists and 730 MRTA 
[Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] terrorists have sought 
shelter so far under the Repentance Law. 
  Espichan said 1,300 terrorists, 300 of whom are serving life 
sentences, were sentenced in 1993. 
<H5>  Sabotage </H5>
  EXPRESO also was able to determine that discrediting the 
Repentance Law mechanisms to discourage the surrender of Shining 
Path militants reportedly has become a key objective for Shining 
Path subversion. 
  Experts on Shining Path subversion, who preferred to remain 
anonymous, said that in order to achieve their objective the 
terrorists now are presenting an alleged new group, reportedly 
formed by former repented terrorists who allegedly have been 
frustrated because they did not receive the Repentance Law's 
benefits. 
  Thus, there allegedly exists a self-styled "5 de Abril" 
group, allegedly formed by former repented terrorists and 
allegedly headed by [Shining Path leader] Julio Cesar Mezzich 
himself. 
  The experts said the Maoist gang actually is seeking methods 
to prevent its supporters from repenting. The experts 
emphasized that the Shining Path's concrete objective is to 
prevent its supporters from seeking shelter under the Repentance 
Law. 
  The experts noted: "The terrorists are engaged in a sabotage 
campaign against the Repentance Law because it represents the 
measure most threatening to them." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cusco, Peru, 12 Jan (AFP) -- The Peruvian police 
have reported that at least 15 high-ranking military officers 
died today when a helicopter crashed at the international 
airport of Cusco, the former capital of the Inca empire. 
  The helicopter was a total wreck after crashing at the end 
of 
the airport's runway, apparently, for lack of fuel, according to 
preliminary information, the source reported.

  [Text] Lima, 12 Jan (EFE) -- Peruvian General Jose Picon 
Alcalde, who sentenced Abimael Guzman and Victor Polay, the 
leaders of the Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement, respectively, to life in prison, died today with 13 
other high-ranking officers when the helicopter in which they 
were travelling crashed in Cusco. 
  One week ago, General Picon, former chairman of the 4th 
Supreme Council of Military Justice, assumed command of Peru's 
4th Military Region, headquartered in Cusco, a south Andes 
region. According to Radio Programas del Peru Network, the 
tragedy occurred under circumstances that have not been clearly 
explained yet, when the aircraft was overflying Cusco's Velasco 
Astete Airport. 
  According to an initial military report, the helicopter 
crashed for lack of fuel, but witnesses told the radio station 
that the aircraft exploded in the air, before crashing. This 
second version involves the possibility of the incident being a 
terrorist attack. 
  The crash zone, a 200 square meter area over which the 
helicopter debris and bodies of the passengers are spread, has 
been surrounded by troops who are keeping the media away.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Many Officials in the Armed Forces"] </F>
  [Text] Those who follow developments within the Armed 
Forces closely -- something that still is an occult art in Peru 
-- have been surprised by the number of officers promoted to the 
rank of division general while at the same time no retirements 
or the so-called "changes of commission" -- i.e. commanders' new 
stations -- have been announced yet, something that generally 
takes place by mid-December. 
  This delay not only demands a satisfactory explanation but 
also leads to the issue -- which seems to be taking forever to 
settle -- of the necessary reform of the Armed Forces. The 
promotion of a considerable number of generals without there 
being a single retirement only worsens the old problem of an 
excess number of officers in our Armed Forces. 
  Granted, sending officers into retirement does not ease the 
burden on the state, but at least the number of officers on 
active duty does not continue to grow and, ultimately, the 
budget will tend to be divided among fewer officers. 
  To the contrary, the overpopulation of officers has an 
immediate effect on the efficiency of institutes and on costs 
and wages. The fact that officers do not earn a decent salary 
is due, to a certain extent, to their being too many of them. 
Low wages, in turn, are a hotbed for all sorts of corrupt 
practices that undermine the Armed Forces' morale. In the end, 
only those who manage to accommodate those practices or who have 
a family fortune tend to survive, and not necessarily the 
upright and talented ones. 
  Therefore, it is a matter of national security to implement 
an important reform within the Armed Forces. It should not only 
include the number of officers but also the equipment it has and 
the purchases made. The lack of openness in military purchases 
-- reportedly justified by the very nature of the issues linked 
to national defense -- prevalent for such a long time has given 
rise to a stifling atmosphere that has bred corruption. The 
embezzlement committed against the Navy, for example, is a case 
in which the country will not back off from its determination to 
find the culprits. 
  The subject of the Armed Forces and the necessary openness 
on 
its main issues has not been properly approached yet. And it 
should be approached properly just as much as the rest of the 
main national subjects. The armed institutions must not remain 
aside in the reform that is being carried out in all sectors of 
society, the economy, and the state, and that is making our 
national recovery possible.

<F P=106> [Article by Ribamar Oliveira] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso has 
changed his fiscal adjustment proposal. He yesterday submitted 
to Gonzaga Motta, PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] 
deputy for Ceara and coordinator of the special committee in the 
Chamber of Deputies that is analyzing the minister's second 
economic plan, a new proposal blocking 7.5 percent of the fund 
tranfers to state governments, and leaving municipal funds 
untouched. The original proposal was to retain 15 percent of 
funds for state and municipal governments. The blocked funds 
will be used for the creation of the Emergency Social Fund. 
  After meeting with Cardoso and special Finance Ministry 
advisor Edmar Bacha, Motta said that "it was unfair to affect 
municipal governments, because 80 percent of them survive on 
fund transfers." By blocking 15 percent of transfers the 
government expected to collect approximately $2.7 billion, $1.4 
million from municipal funds and $1.3 billion from state funds. 
  With the new proposal, collected funds will drop to $650 
million. Gonzaga Motta said that the difference will be 
compensated for with an increase on the taxable percentages of 
the tax on manufactured products, the IPI, which will affect 
exports, and through the withholding -- by the Union -- of the 
income tax of federal public employees. This will put the 
federal public servants' income tax outside the cake that is 
shared with states and municipal districts. 
  "I believe the PMDB will like the changes in the economic 
program," Motta said. 
  Last Friday, a fiscal adjustment subcommittee chaired by 
Luiz 
Roberto Ponte, PMDB deputy for Rio Grande do Sul, approved a 
proposal by which fund transfers to state and municipal 
governments will be 5-percent higher, in real terms, than in 
1994. 
  The modification announced yesterday by Minister Cardoso 
shows that the government has reviewed its figures and has 
preferred states to be partners of the fiscal adjustment instead 
of mere creditors. The modification, however, involves a source 
for political complication, as it maintains the block on fund 
transfers to state governments. This could be another proposal 
for negotiation.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" from interview with Army Chief of Staff General </F>
Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel by Francisco Ferro and Cosme 
Degenar Drumond, in Brasilia on 17 August 1993: "Requirements 
and Prospects" -- introductory paragraphs in boldface as 
published] 
  [Text] In any field of professional activity, looking 
at the future is always a risky business. Even if decisionmaking 
is backed by evaluations, studies, and forecasts, unexpected 
events are almost always detrimental to long-range decisions. In 
the military area in particular, there are many examples showing 
the difference between actual capability and the desirable 
level. But despite that, forecasts, studies, and evaluations are 
still of basic importance in reaching decisions affecting the 
future. 
  In the Armed Forces, those functions are performed by 
high-ranking officers with outstanding ability, and their 
purpose is to point decisions by the higher commands in the 
right direction. Known as general staff activities, they are an 
efficient tool that commanders rely on in order to exercise 
their command, even at the risk of being faced with unforeseen 
and pressing events. 
  In the Brazilian Army more specifically, the general 
advisory organization responsible to the minister for preparing 
and guiding that institution in its use of the ground force is 
the Army General Staff. Established on 24 October 1896 and 
located at Army Headquarters in Brasilia, the Army General Staff 
consists of a chief of staff, a deputy chief of staff, and six 
assistant chiefs of staff who specialize in various military 
matters. Its vast range of duties also includes responsibility 
for cooperating with the Armed Forces General Staff (EMFA) in 
studies aimed at establishing military doctrine, policy, and 
strategies. 
  The current Army chief of staff is a four-star general: 
Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel. A native of Piraju, Sao Paulo, 
General Leonel has an extensive record of service to the 
Army--his military career spans nearly 50 years--and he was 
promoted to full general in July of last year. In the line of 
hierarchical succession, the Army chief of staff takes charge of 
the Ministry of Army if the actual minister is absent. 
  On the morning of last 17 August, Gen. Leonel received 
the editors of TECNOLOGIA &amp; DEFESA, Francisco Ferro and Cosme 
Degenar Drumond, in his office. On that occasion, he commented 
to our magazine exclusively regarding important matters related 
to current military affairs and enumerated the Brazilian Army's 
priorities in terms of the country's financial capabilities. 
Here are the principal excerpts from his remarks during that 
interview. 
<H5>  Simulation System </H5>
  "With a view to increasing the efficiency of training while 
also achieving cost-benefit gains, the Army has acquired a Small 
Caliber Arms Effect Simulation System. That modern equipment, 
which has been adopted by the armed forces of several countries, 
will enable us to improve training standards in small units 
(companies and platoons) by making the execution of dual-purpose 
maneuvers possible. The equipment will be assigned to a 
motorized infantry brigade. The company supplying the system 
will provide a 12-day training period for officers from various 
units." 
<H5>  Electronic Warfare </H5>
  "This is a priority for the Army because it is a factor for 
modernization and increased operational effectiveness in the 
service. The phases of this project include personnel training 
and the introduction of high-performance tactical and strategic 
systems in the field of communications and noncommunications, 
the objective being to monitor the electromagnetic spectrum. 
Personnel will be trained at the Electronic Warfare Training 
Center, a unit that provides officers and NCO's--and, through a 
cooperative effort, the Navy and Air Force--with specialized 
training in that activity." 
<H5>  Modernization of Equipment </H5>
  "The modernization of equipment will be aimed not only at 
meeting the demands of modern warfare, which require that we 
have materiel more suited to existing operational environments, 
but also and chiefly at saving money. With that in mind, the 
limitations imposed by the current economic situation are being 
taken into account. The current priorities in the modernization 
effort are armored vehicles and field artillery equipment, but 
we are not losing sight of the needs in other 
areas--communications equipment, for example." 
<H5>  Antitank Missile </H5>
  "The MSS-1.2 antitank missile has been developed and is now 
going through the final phases preceding industrial production. 
This weapon is the result of cooperation between the Army and a 
European firm. It is a missile of the latest generation with an 
effective range of about 3.5 km and the ability to destroy the 
most modern armor currently in existence. Production is expected 
to begin in 1994, and at that point distribution to the infantry 
battalions will begin." 
<H5>  Osorio Main Battle Tank </H5>
  "Several tests conducted in international competitions show 
that the Osorio, manufactured by Engesa [Specialized Engineers, 
Inc.], is a tank in the same class as the M1 Abrams (American), 
the Challenger (British), and the Leopard II (German) and that 
it is superior to the first-line tanks of other countries. The 
Army worked with Engesa to develop this tank." 
<H5>  Ballistic Protection Helmets </H5>
  "Individual protection is essential for the soldier on the 
battlefield, who is exposed to four kinds of threats: shrapnel, 
projectiles, blast effects, and incendiary effects. As far as 
helmets are concerned, it is necessary to obtain a more suitable 
model that is more comfortable and affords increased ballistic 
protection. Some countries have used a composite material made 
of aramid and polymer resins. The Brazilian Army intends to 
gradually replace the old steel-fiber helmets with a highly 
functional light combat helmet providing ballistic protection. 
It has an effective shape and can be used on various missions." 
<H5>  New Suppliers </H5>
  "The configuration of the world today is quite different 
from 
what it was five years ago. Until just recently, the Brazilian 
Army looked for equipment in West Europe and the United States. 
But today there are other potential suppliers: Russia, China, 
Korea, and Taiwan, for example. Those countries have interesting 
things to offer, and we are engaged in a process of developing 
closer relations with them by observing and making certain 
analyses. It is essential to pay attention to three principles: 
the materiel itself, logistics, and technology transfer when 
required." 
<H5>  Foreign Materiel </H5>
  "Before buying any materiel abroad, the Army needs to know 
whether the supplying firm is 100-percent privately owned or a 
state-owned firm and the kind of economic-financial policy its 
country has. For example, when the Army deals with a foreign 
firm, it needs to be certain that the government of that country 
will support and guarantee the transaction, because we must seek 
the best for Brazil." 
<H5>  Antiaircraft Artillery </H5>
  "The Secretariat of Science and Technology is continuing its 
studies and projects aimed at the development of a Brazilian 
surface-to-air missile. Portable infrared-guided missiles will 
be acquired to expand our current defense capability. Plans also 
call for acquiring a battery of laser-guided missiles 
(optronic)." 
<H5>  Field Artillery </H5>
  "This involves several current programs: a) modernization of 
the M-108's, including the replacement of engines and changes to 
the vehicle transmission systems, to be completed in 1996; b) 
modernization of the self-propelled 155mm howitzers and the 
self-propelled 105mm's to increase their ranges by 32 km and 17 
km respectively. This program is being carried out by a British 
firm that will transfer the technology; c) the acquisition by 
1996 of a large number of 105mm howitzers; d) studies and tests 
on the use of 105mm ordnance in the Amazon Region; e) the 
acquisition by 1996 of area saturation rocket systems; f) a 
start on the incorporation of modern radar target seeking 
equipment and sound ranging equipment as well as sight, laser, 
and infrared ranging equipment; and g) the acquisition, now 
under way, of photographing equipment and electronic fire 
computing equipment." 
<H5>  Coast Artillery </H5>
  "Defending the coast and navigable inland waterways is an 
Army concern. The General Staff is conducting studies for 
ensuring suitable defense of the tactically important points 
controlling access to the Amazon Region." 
<H5>  Domestic Expertise </H5>
  "This is fundamental for the Army. We are collecting 
know-how 
outside the country in the initial phase and then encouraging 
our own firms to participate in technological development. I 
believe that the same thing is also going to happen in 
connection with Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System]. As 
the program continues, the Army will enlist domestic industry. 
When you talk about materiel for military use, domestic 
industry, and the Armed Forces, that combination is a great 
platform for giving development a boost, with applications in 
many other areas. Technical know-how radiates out into the 
civilian area. There is no doubt that the Armed Forces play an 
important part in the country's development." 
<H5>  Support for Industry </H5>
  "A country's security does not depend solely on its Armed 
Forces. It also involves the economic, psychosocial, and 
political areas in addition to scientific and technological 
development. The ability to design and manufacture materiel for 
military use is very important for strengthening our defense 
capability. The peace and progress that we all want for Brazil 
depend upon the integration of Armed Forces and industry. One of 
the efforts that the Army has been making in the area of 
industrial integration is Sicatex (Army Cataloguing System). The 
Army has a special affection for domestic firms which, besides 
working with production, also engage in research and carry out 
technological projects. Those firms deserve closer attention. In 
all projects of interest to the Army, the participation of our 
firms has been preserved. We cannot promise anything at the 
moment because of budget difficulties, but as soon as things 
improve, we will continue to support projects being carried out 
by our firms." 
<H5>  Military Service </H5>
  "The Military Service System administers the Army's most 
important resource: people. It should be pointed out that even 
the Royal Charter dated 22 March 1776 ordered that everyone, 
with no distinction as to class, should participate in the 
defense of the territory. The current recruitment process has 
served very well throughout this entire period and lived up to 
Olavo Bilac's expectations regarding its role in promoting 
patriotism. The essential thing is to decide what is best for 
the country. We must decide that question ourselves without 
importing any models, especially since 83 of the 143 countries 
with organized armed forces have universal conscription, and our 
solution must be the result of an analysis taking into account 
geopolitical factors--size of the territory and 
population--among other things. The Military Service Law and its 
implementing regulations, based on Brazilian tradition and prior 
legislation, are the consolidation of long-time practice in 
dealing with the activities of military service." 
<H5>  Army Aviation </H5>
  "Our Army Air Force comprises two types of helicopters: 
reconnaissance/attack helicopters and utility helicopters. There 
are a total of 54 aircraft, and they are going to be joined by 
another 18 reconnaissance/attack helicopters that we are in the 
process of receiving. To meet its requirements for logistic 
support and pilot training, the Army is looking into the 
acquisition of freight helicopters and training helicopters." 
<H5>  Adoption of GPS </H5>
  "The adoption of portable equipment for determining one's 
position by the use of satellites leads to greater speed and 
accuracy in all combat missions. In order to conduct military 
operations in the field, it is essential for the fighter to know 
the exact location of his forces and of the enemy. The use of 
GPS [Global Positioning System] and other similar equipment 
greatly facilitates missions for all combat echelons and makes 
greater operational performance possible. The importance of that 
kind of equipment is very great in areas with difficult terrain, 
where there is dense plant cover and few reference points, the 
Amazon Region being one example." 
<H5>  New Caliber </H5>
  "Several foreign armies have been adopting 5.56mm caliber 
personal weapons to replace the traditional 7.6.2mm. Besides 
helping to reduce weight and volume, the new caliber enables a 
fighter to carry more ammunition for the same weapon. Ballistic 
studies show that the 5.56mm weapon meets the requirements for 
range, penetration, and shock power. Some units of the Brazilian 
Army are already testing the FAL 5.56mm, produced by Imbel [War 
Materiel Industry], and preparing to use it." 
<H5>  Computerization </H5>
  "The current state of computerization in the Army is 
characterized by a growing concern with the training and 
technical expertise of personnel and efforts to assimilate the 
culture of information processing; the search for a level of 
standardization that can improve productivity, quality, and the 
interaction between systems; awareness of the need to turn the 
user of information processing into the subject of the process 
by encouraging his active participation in the same; and the 
planning and implementation--now under way--of integrated 
systems for dealing with personnel and equipment and, later, 
economy and finance. Those systems will make it possible to 
develop other systems which are no less important than the 
former but which are dependent upon them." 
<H5>  Brazilian Amazon Region </H5>
  "It is unquestionably an area of great strategic importance. 
The chief element in the vivification and development of that 
vast area--a slow process until recently--has been the 
pioneering work of the Armed Forces. The Federal Government laid 
the groundwork for the Calha Norte Project in 1985, and the 
actual work, which started in 1986, was to be carried out 
jointly by several government agencies. The project covers the 
region located north of the Solimoes and Amazon Rivers. Because 
it was already organized in the area, the Army quickly began 
working on the project." 
<H5>  Reserve Training Centers </H5>
  "The Ministry of Army establishes reserve training centers 
at 
the request of the municipal governments, which address those 
requests to the commanders of the military regions. The centers 
are primarily the result of a municipal community effort. The 
Ministries of Army and Social Welfare have set up an 
interministerial coordinating committee for actions resulting 
from a protocol of intention covering the establishment of TG 
[reserve training center] programs in areas that lack them. Work 
to establish a pilot project (six TG's) is scheduled to begin in 
1994. Those installations will also be used for activities of a 
social nature under the coordination of community centers." 
<H5>  Finances </H5>
  "As far as the Army is concerned, the current fiscal year 
has 
meant an unprecedented exercise in adaptations and adjustments. 
Since the 1993 budget could not be approved until the end of 
April and actually implemented until June 1993, the ground force 
got through the first five months of the year with equivalent 
funds and only 12 percent of the amount it expected to have for 
operations and investment. The Army has an interest in getting 
its budget ceilings increased in 1994, because otherwise its 
operational capability will suffer."

<F P=106> [Message to the nation by Guatemalan President Ramiro de </F>
Leon Carpio in Guatemala City -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] Guatemalan people: Today, the government of the 
Republic and the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] 
formally pledged, in a written document, to sign a peace 
agreement in 1994. Guatemala is making history. Today, 10 
January 1994, should signal to all Guatemalans that there is a 
new light in the process to consolidate our democracy. Today a 
new opportunity emerges. We must not and will not lose this 
opportunity because our government is determined to show its 
political willingness to achieve peace. 
  Because of the importance of what occurred in Mexico today, 
I 
wish to tell you that the agreement to renew the peace 
negotiations has been signed by the government peace commission 
and the URNG General Command, as witnessed by the UN secretary 
general's representative. Following intense work during the 
period 6-10 January, the two delegations agreed on a framework 
to foster the resumption of an in-depth and dynamic negotiation 
process that will open the door to a prompt solution of the 
armed conflict. 
  The signed agreement covers the main aspects of the 
negotiation mechanism and in it the parties sought to design 
innovative mechanisms, bearing in mind the previous accords and 
achievements. Within the framework of bilateral negotiations, 
the parties agreed to ask the UN secretary general to appoint a 
moderator to promote the reaching of agreements on the entire 
negotiation agenda, which was approved in Mexico in 1991. The 
parties have expressed their commitment to reaching a firm and 
lasting peace agreement in the briefest possible time during 
1994. 
  They also agreed to promote the creation of an assembly that 
will promote reciprocal contributions from civilian society and 
the participants in the negotiation process. Therefore, they 
agreed to ask the Guatemalan Bishops Conference to appoint the 
president of an assembly of civilian sectors, bearing in mind 
for this position Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno who would 
have the special mission of promoting, here in Guatemala, a 
consensus among civilian society regarding the essential topics 
on the negotiation agenda. He would subsequently foster the 
approval of the agreements signed by the parties, so they can 
become great national commitments. 
  To strengthen the negotiation process, the parties also 
agreed to ask the Governments of Colombia, the United States, 
Spain, Mexico, Norway, and Venezuela to form a group of friends 
of the Guatemalan peace process, so they can be honor witnesses 
to the agreements reached by the parties. The parties 
reiterated that verification is a fundamental element to 
guaranteeing the fulfillment of the agreements. Therefore, they 
should be accompanied by appropriate national and international 
verification mechanisms. For this reason they will ask the 
United Nations to undertake the international verification of 
the agreements. 
  It is truly satisfactory to confirm today, with the approval 
of the framework for the resumption of the negotiations, that 
the parties are demonstrating their willingness to reach the 
goals established in the agreement. There is still difficult 
work to be done to make this new framework bear fruit with 
specific achievements in the discussion of the general agenda of 
the negotiations. 
  The next round of negotiations will be held in the second 
half of February. It will be devoted to the discussion of the 
agreement on human rights and the setting of a timetable for the 
negotiation agenda. It is an ambitious but essential program to 
conclude, with the flexibility being demonstrated now, 
successful negotiations. 
  I wish to express thanks for the constant interest shown and 
the support provided by the international community and my 
appreciation of the hospitality shown by Mexico, which has 
always supported the peace efforts in Guatemala. In particular, 
I wish to thank the United Nations, which has permitted the 
setting for this successful meeting. 
  Fellow countrymen: Guatemala has begun to build peace, 
working simultaneously for the two focal points of the peace 
plan that our government proposed to the Guatemalan people -- 
national reconciliation and the fight against poverty, as a 
means to building a firm and lasting peace. We Guatemalans 
should jointly build peace. Today, we have taken a great step 
by beginning the end of the domestic armed conflict, above all 
bearing in mind that there are human lives at stake. But this 
is not enough to achieve overall peace. It is here in 
Guatemala, with productive work and attention to the people's 
most heartfelt needs, that unitedly we should build peace with 
social justice for all Guatemalans. Thank you very much and 
good night.

  [Text] Military spokesmen in Managua who asked not to be 
identified said on 11 January that a group of 300 Nicaraguans 
are being trained in Honduran territory by U.S. instructors. 
The soldiers, who demanded that their names not be revealed, 
said the rebels, presumably anti-Sandinists, are being trained 
by two U.S. instructors. According to the sources, the rebels 
receiving military training are based in Yamales, near the 
Nicaraguan-Honduran border. They added that the rebels receive 
supplies every two days in a helicopter identified as an HLH 
[expansion unknown].

  [Text] Father Yvon Massac, Fermathe parish priest, seeks to 
restore Aristide. He asks U.S. President Bill Clinton to provide 
for the deployment of a UN mission to Haiti. In an open letter 
dated 7 January to the U.S. President, the Fermathe parish 
priest reiterates his request for a total, complete blockade, 
including a rigorous watch on the Haitian-Dominican border, as 
the means of resolving the Haitian crisis. The international 
community must act effectively and quickly so the suffering of 
the deprived masses can end, says Father Massac, who enjoins Mr. 
Clinton to put pressure on the military authorities to restore 
the president-in-exile within three months. 
  [Begin Massac recording, in Creole] The people ask you not 
to 
encourage any reconciliation conference in the midst of a 
concert of gunshots. The fact is that the coupists do not want 
reconciliation. They want power through blood so they can 
plunder. Order and safety must be restored before any national 
conference can be held in Haiti. 
  Secondly, the Haitian people are weighed down by an embargo 
on human rights. That is why they ask you to make the UN embargo 
and blockade total and complete, and to block the border between 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic so we can be done quickly with 
the sufferings of the coup. 
  Third, concerning the assistance of other countries in 
resolving the crisis, do not let the United States do anything 
by itself in Haiti, especially regarding Army reforms and 
military intervention. [end recording] 
  That was Father Yvon Massac, Fermathe parish priest.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pedro Ross Leal, Politburo member and </F>
secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation, CTC, by 
Antonio Resillez in Havana on the "Open Agenda" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Resillez] Good evening. As announced, we have on 
our Open Agenda program today Comrade Pedro Ross, a member of 
the Politburo and secretary general of the CTC [Cuban Workers 
Federation]. I should say that we contacted Comrade Ross by 
phone at noon yesterday, Monday, 10 January, while he was in 
Pinar del Rio on a work visit. That is how we came to invite him 
to appear on this program today, so we could have a talk in 
front of the cameras with a view to informing the public. 
  Before beginning this conversation, I would like to recall a 
number of figures and reflections on the nation's financial 
situation: At the last ordinary session of our national 
assembly, our parliament, the sector minister, Comrade Jose Luis 
Rodriguez [minister president, State Committee for Finance], 
presented a list of indicators, illustrative of the tight 
situation our national economy is in. Of these indicators, I 
wish to mention only three, to serve as a reminder to our entire 
population. The excess currency circulating in the country at 
the present time is the equivalent of 14 months' salary: that 
is, slightly over 12 billion pesos. The state budget deficit 
comes to 4.6 billion. Subsidies to the sugar agroindustry in the 
past three years come to 7.2 billion pesos. To this I would like 
to add that only 30 percent of state enterprises are at the 
present time (?profitable). The country must obviously reverse 
this financial situation, the causes of which are well known to 
our entire population. I am talking about both national and 
international causes. 
  At this same assembly session we are talking about, our 
commander in chief directed that our entire population be made 
aware of this financial situation and actively participate in 
the discussion and analysis, and make proposals with regard to 
the group -- or as he put it, the arsenal -- of measures aimed 
at restructuring [sanear] our economy. We think it is precisely 
the CTC that has taken the first step in this direction, by 
calling for, in the name of the parliament and at the work 
centers, an interesting process of analyzing our financial 
situation. 
  Ross, precisely how will this process of analysis take 
place, 
throughout Cuba? 
  [Ross] Well, Resillez, this way: Heeding the exhortation by 
our commander in chief to first reflect with the workers, with 
our entire people, before adopting the measures that were 
discussed in our parliament, we have called for a process of 
holding assemblies with all the nation's workers. This process 
begins with preparing the union cadres, from the professional 
cadres and the cadres at the national level, to the base-level 
cadres. We have over 400,000 union leaders in Cuba, and this 
process of preparing the union cadres [words indistinct] is 
going to serve to get the union leaders' opinions on these 
matters. It is not going to be a seminar in which the union 
leaders are going to passively receive our suggestions. Rather, 
it is going to be a dialogue, a discussion of all these matters 
with union leaders: provincial- and municipal-level leaders, 
leaders from work centers, (?from various sectors) -- however it 
is most feasible to organize it. 
  We are going to discuss these subjects, placing at the 
center 
of the discussions the problems of the work centers -- that is, 
what goes on there, what can be done at the work center -- 
because the basic solutions to our problems lie in the 
efficiency we may be able to attain in the production process, 
or in any services we may provide, or export. Therefore, the 
center, the main aspect of this process, is going to be directed 
toward that, toward analyzing how the workers at their work 
centers can contribute to streamlining and revitalizing the 
nation's economy, by working more efficiently, making better use 
of material and human resources, increasing efficiency, and 
improving the quality of work. 
  [Resillez] Pedro, but, at these assemblies, these meetings 
with the union leaders, obviously the group of additional 
measures -- which fall somewhere outside the framework of the 
work center -- will also be broached. 
  [Ross] Indeed, but one must (?bear in mind the extent to 
which) the subject has already been broached at the work center 
-- which, I reiterate, is fundamental. So we are going to see 
what ideas the union leaders have in this case, in this first 
phase, about how to solve the problems we have with internal 
finances; what measures can be applied to effect this 
restructuring [saneamiento]. For example, subjects that appeared 
in yesterday's editorial of the newspaper TRABAJADORES are going 
to be discussed. The questions to which we want the workers to 
provide answers during these upcoming discussions are there. 
  [Resillez] I see. Now Comrade Ross, parallel to this 
process with the union leaders -- some 400,000 nationwide, as 
you pointed out -- I know that direct assemblies are also being 
held at the work centers. We were saying specifically at the 
beginning of the program that you were at two work centers 
involved in this activity in Pinar del Rio. What happened there, 
at those work centers? 
  [Ross] Well, at those work centers, we tried to set up the 
initial experiences because indeed as you say, in parallel, we 
are to try this out at selected work centers throughout Cuba, so 
that by the time we conclude the process with the union cadres, 
we will have already had experience in making direct contact 
with the workers. 
  The experience we had in Pinar del Rio was a very 
interesting 
one. There was a very rich, very broad, very open discussion of 
problems specific to these two work centers. One was a food 
industry center that produces for export. That center was, 
precisely, a center that was profitable until 1992. In 1993, it 
became unprofitable: that is, the cost per peso [value of goods 
produced] rose to 1.24 pesos. We sought to learn the reason for 
this from the workers at this center, which is a magnificent 
work center. 
  They had well identified the reasons the cost per peso had 
risen. Up to 1992, that cost had been 95 cents. What happened 
was that the center had been sent a piece of equipment that the 
workers had had to rebuild in order to get it operational. It 
was a piece of machinery that had been discontinued. This caused 
them to have to devote resources that had not been planned for 
to rebuilding the piece of machinery. Because of this, a segment 
of the production process was paralyzed, causing costs to rise 
despite great effort by the workers. 
  Now I can tell you that already in the early days of January 
1994, the cost per peso of production at this work center comes 
out to 1.07; and they think they can bring production costs down 
to below one peso during this current month of January. That was 
La Primavera work center. A set of ideas as to how to reduce 
costs, how to achieve this, emerged there. These ideas were well 
defined and I am certain that that work group is going to 
achieve it. 
  A very interesting thing: La Primavera is a work group 
designed to consist of 111 people, but has been operating with 
85 workers, 90 at most. They have reduced the indirect-labor 
personnel. They recommended a continuing reduction of 
indirect-labor personnel -- the CBP's [not further identified], 
for example. There are four CBP's and a head of security for a 
center with 90 workers. So it became clear, the centers' workers 
and administration both realized, that this has to be further 
reduced because it has a big effect. There were nine CBP slots 
in the original personnel roster for that center, which was 
originally for a total of 111. 
  [Resillez] Pedro, at these assemblies that were, as you say, 
sort of pilot assemblies in Pinar del Rio, as well as at others 
that are going to take place [words indistinct] also talk [word 
or words indistinct] measures of another kind? 
  [Ross] Yes, of course. After the matter of what to do at 
that 
work center to increase efficiency, because it is a center that 
has raw materials and everything guaranteed, the measures the 
workers think should be adopted to streamline finances and to 
move the economy forward were analyzed. 
  The problem of prices, of the cost-free status of certain 
things, was discussed there. Proposals to see if the price of 
electricity could be raised were made for the country to 
analyze. Assessment was discussed -- charging for housing 
according to assets and earnings. Charging for certain 
entertainments that are currently cost-free, such as sports and 
cultural events, was discussed. Also discussed was the 
advisability of creating a "bond of the fatherland," of lending 
the fatherland money, of our population making a loan to the 
nation: bonds that could be bought without interest, to be 
cashed in five or ten years; bonds that could be bought at a 
certain below- market interest rate, to be cashed in five or ten 
years; and bonds that citizens could buy with no intention of 
cashing them in. That is, there would be... [rephrases] they 
proposed various ways in which this could be done. 
  [Resillez] Yes. 
  [Ross] There were various proposals. For example, light was 
cast there... [changes thought] because it seems there is the 
idea, some people have gotten the idea that to change the 
currency would be very costly and would not solve any problems. 
Nevertheless, it was made clear, there, that, technically, that 
there is the possibility of doing that without much cost. So, 
what did the workers ask, based on that clarification? And what 
will be... [rephrases] what kind of situation will those workers 
with lower incomes find themselves in, because they also believe 
that workers with lower incomes, who practically live from day 
to day, could be hurt [words indistinct]. 
  It was explained that that is not the way it is, that no one 
[words indistinct] change, he who obtained his money in an 
honorable way will have no problem whatsoever (?as regards) his 
money. 
  There the workers came out in favor of mechanisms that will 
permit recovery of the money that has been acquired dishonestly. 
That was a very strong opinion at both assemblies. 
  The other assembly was at a fishing center, and this idea -- 
of how to block the path of wheeler-dealers [macetas] -- not 
just how to recover the money, but how to avoid their 
proliferation. [sentence as heard] We suggested that the way to 
prevent action by these people, who make money off the needs of 
our people, is to get out of this situation. 
  [Resillez] Pedro, let me tell you about an idea that I have 
more or less been formulating as I listen to you. This massive 
process of consultation on the measures to clean up our internal 
financial situation reminds me to some extent of the process 
that took place some time ago, when the call to the Fourth 
Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba was issued. I remember 
that back then, thousands of people, thousands of comrades, 
thousands of Cubans, millions of us Cubans participated in 
numerous assemblies, where the opinions we all wanted to be 
taken before the Party Congress were collected. The CTC has 
today undertaken a process I would say is, though not identical, 
similar because of its scope and because of the way people want, 
in keeping with the commander in chief's guidance, for all of us 
to participate in understanding and to present our ideas in this 
regard. I think that 400,000 workers with different union 
responsibilities is a big number; moreover, I think the number 
of comrades who are going to participate in the second phase is 
far greater. Do we have any idea of how many comrades are going 
to participate, through this process at the work centers, which 
have come to be called "the parliament of the work centers," and 
how many assemblies are to be held nationwide? 
  [Ross] Well, we calculate that over 80,000 assemblies will 
be 
held, and that over 3 million workers will participate in them. 
It is not a process by which people will gather together in one 
rushed meeting and raise their hands in support of a task. We 
would like the workers to first think about the measures that 
could be taken, about the significance of those measures; and we 
also want them to assume responsibility for those measures, 
because those measures also affect us all. All of us must make 
some sacrifice if we want any of these measures to be adopted... 
[changes thought] for example, at one of these centers, it was 
suggested that the prices of certain articles that are today 
subsidized should be increased. We explained that to do so meant 
a burden for the workers themselves. They assimilated this. They 
said there was no other way. This was much discussed. 
  Certain people suggested -- for example, there at the 
fishing 
center -- that the prices of all goods except bread and milk 
should be raised. One worker said this. Another suggested... 
[rephrases] a female worker stated that medical services should 
be charged for. And we there seized the occasion to say that, 
well, there are medical services that the immense majority of 
the citizens cannot afford. Where is he who has a child who 
needs heart surgery, or who needs kidney surgery or who needs a 
transplant, going to get the U.S. $50,000 that any one of these 
operations costs? And, are we going to let him die? So then they 
said no. 
  So. Also, we have to preserve this as one of the achievments 
our people have attained. But in order to preserve that 
attainment, we have to solve other problems that will permit us 
to preserve the achievement. 
  And then the comrade said: No, it is better to increase the 
price of bread and milk, if need be, before charging for health 
care, or for education. 
  Nevertheless, that was a reflection of the workers 
themselves. Made very agreeably. And it was a very profound 
reflection, too, because one can see that the workers are aware 
of what is being dealt with. 
  Now they are beginning to become aware of the fact that 
what is being dealt with is they themselves, and therefore they 
take a stand. At these two work centers, the workers'sense of 
patriotism got to running very high. Very high. Because the 
proposals they made, aware of what it would mean to them, is 
what we hope happens at all the nation's work centers. 
  [Resillez] Pedro, let me insist a bit on this thought that I 
expressed to you regarding how this process reminds me of the 
Fourth [Communist Party of Cuba] Congress, of the call to the 
Fourth Congress. 
  Participation is, of course, important. It is requested. 
People are directed to participate, and the participation of 
many of us in these work meetings is desirable. But how are you 
planning to gather these opinions and have them circulate -- I 
mean, have them not just stay right there, at the assembly where 
they are expressed? 
  [Ross] In the first place, there are many matters that are 
brought up during this process that have to be answered -- for 
the workers themselves, because they constitute questions, or 
doubts, or confusions that people sometimes have regarding a 
particular topic, or one thing or another. Erroneous 
interpretations in connection with a problem are also cleared up 
at these meetings. On the other hand, a document of what is put 
forth is being drawn up -- of what is proposed, of what each one 
of the workers brings up -- and all that is going to be summed 
up. 
  Precisely, we are going to sum up this process with the 
union 
leaders on the 29th, at a plenum of the National Committee of 
the CTC, where they will be able to give their opinions. We are 
going to discuss the principal problems brought up during this 
first part of the process, so that we will already have an 
arsenal of ideas, an arsenal of how union leaders, all the way 
down to base-level, think, with which to tackle the bulk of the 
process, the remainder of the overall process. 
  [Resillez] Which would begin when, Pedro? 
  [Ross] It would begin right after the 29th, on the 30th. 
Although we are holding these pilot assemblies now. For example, 
tomorrow we are going to be at the La Corona Cigar Factory, here 
in Havana. It is going to be the first such assembly in the City 
of Havana and will serve as a model for the leaders who have to 
tackle this task here in the capital. The La Corona is a 
historic center, because it is there that Lazaro Pena worked and 
carried out his union work. That is where he learned. 
  So, there will be answers for the workers. Whatever may be 
set forth in the most remote corner of the nation will be heard 
and taken into account. It will be taken into account. 
  [Resillez] Let me tell you, Pedro, that many viewers have 
been calling in to ask questions. Some of these questions 
coincide with these that we have been talking about here; other 
questions from our television viewers stray, actually, from the 
center of the informational dialogue that we have proposed to 
hold with Comrade Ross. But I must say that this "Open Agenda" 
program, as well as the entire informational system of Cuban 
television, will discuss abundantly many of the aspects brought 
up by our television viewers. Moreover, if any comrade wishes to 
leave his name and address, as on other occasions, the CTC -- 
and Comrade Ross, personally -- are willing to provide the 
answers necessary to satisfy the comrade's questions. 
  [Ross] Furthermore, we will be on [Radio] Progreso Saturday 
[15 January], at 0700, which... 
  [Resillez, commenting while Ross is talking] The viewer can 
obtain information there too. 
  [Ross] ...is on a topic broader than this one, not as 
specific as this one. 
  [Resillez] Great! So then, Pedro, may I infer that the 
process of consultations that is, in fact, already underway at 
all work centers under the name "the parliament at the work 
centers" is an element fundamental to arriving at the next 
session of the assembly with a greater popular consensus -- a 
special session that is to be called in order to take up the 
matter of the nation's finances once again? 
  [Ross] Exactly. By the time we come to this next session of 
the assembly, since the parliamentarians of the 
provinces...[corrects himself] the comrade deputies of the 
provinces where the process is going to be held are going to 
participate actively in [words indistinct] they are going to be 
able to participate, not just listen but also answer. They are 
going to be able to exchange ideas with the workers. This will 
be a way of giving continuity to the discussions that began in 
our legislature. 
  [Resillez] At the end of December. 
  [Ross] At the end of December. Exactly. 
  [Resillez] On 28 January, the CTC celebrates its 55th 
anniversary. I must say that, in the last few weeks, like almost 
every Cuban who has had access to the newspaper TRABAJADORES, I 
have read and reread a group of editorials I consider very 
interesting, extremely interesting. These editorials set a 
standard, I would say; they outline tactics and strategy for the 
workers movement. I mean, for [words indistinct] in the present 
and immediate future. [Words indistinct] 55th anniversary of the 
CTC [words indistinct]. (?I ask you, as) secretary general of 
the CTC: What are the basic elements that should characterize 
the workers movement, at this historic moment in Cuba, on this 
55th anniversary? 
  [Ross] We have sought to have the union movement occupy, on 
this 55th anniversary, the place that befits it in this battle 
our population is waging -- because what it is a matter of; what 
is being defended, right now; what is at stake are the workers' 
vital interests. Therefore, we want the workers to be focused on 
defending those achievements that we have won throughout these 
past 35 years; on preserving [words indistinct] and of the power 
of the workers. 
  It is a matter of giving continuity to the work of the 
Revolution. And in order to do that, we have to get out of this 
situation, save the Revolution, as has been stated. And it is 
the workers to whom the fundamental role falls, in that 
connection. Therefore, the 55th anniversary will be (?marked) 
[word indistinct] along that line. We are not going to celebrate 
any festivities. We have to concentrate on this. This is our 
fundamental task: to defend our present and to defend our 
future, the future of our children. That is what this is all 
about. And that is the discussion. The discussion also has to do 
with having the workers become aware of that. 
  And I think that a very good ambience is being created at 
the 
work centers. The newspaper TRABAJADORES has contributed to this. 
  [Resillez] I am convinced this is true, Comrade Ross; and I 
think that this process is also going to mark, like many another 
of our working class's initiatives, an important moment in the 
Revolution. 
  [Ross] Yes, Resillez. Something we notice, among the 
workers, 
is that the workers are very sure that the Revolution is not 
going to abandon them, that the Revolution constitutes the 
guarantee of their interests. They are confident that no one is 
going to be left helpless in this country -- no one who needs 
help. 
  [Resillez] Thank you very much, Comrade Ross, for your talk; 
for having responded positively to our invitation despite the 
short time between noon yesterday and today, and for this 
information that we have provided for the entire country 
regarding a topic that is truly hot. I must add that this topic 
will continue to be discussed in future editions of "Open 
Agenda," as well as in other spots in Cuban television's 
informational system. 
  We would like to thank you, our viewers, for your attention, 
and we will see you again next Tuesday on "Open Agenda." Good 
night.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Peruvian economic developments monitored through 11 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  The National Association of Exporters said today that in 
1993, Peru's trade balance was negative for a third consecutive 
year. The export-import deficit reached $530 million. In 1993, 
Peru exported goods worth $3.467 billion and imported goods 
worth $3.997 billion. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1833 GMT 5 
Jan 94) 
  According to Petroperu, the state petroleum agency, crude 
oil 
production increased 9.2 percent in 1993 over 1992. Daily 
production is averaging 126,200 barrels. (Paris AFP in Spanish 
2129 GMT 4 Jan 94) 
  Canadian Foreign Relations Minister Cristine Stewart said on 
8 January that $25 million will be given to Peru for assistance 
programs, specifically targeting social programs. Stewart also 
noted that Canadian businessmen are interested in investing in 
Peru and that she will study investment prospects in this 
country during her visit. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2315 GMT 8 Jan 
94) 
  The German and Peruvian Governments today agreed to 
consolidate the Peruvian debt. According to the agreement, due 
dates for Peruvian debt have been rescheduled for March 1996 in 
order to reduce pressure to make payments on $90 million. 
Economy Minister Jorge Camet said that the agreement has also 
postponed the cancellation of loans until 2003 and 2006. Camet 
also stressed that a recent $30-million loan by the German 
Government is part of its 1993 contribution to the Support Group 
for Peru. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 0142 GMT 5 Jan 94) 
  Peru collected $4 billion in taxes in 1993. The National 
Superintendency of Tax Administration confirmed that as a result 
Peru has surpassed the goal set by the IMF, which said that 
taxes collected in 1993 must be equal to 10 percent of the gross 
national product. (Lima Global de Television Network in Spanish 
0100 GMT 5 Jan 94) 
  Modifications to the tax system designed to increase tax 
revenues will take effect on 1 January. People earning less 
than 900 soles a month will not pay any income tax, while those 
earning more than that figure will pay a 15-percent income tax. 
People earning 7,000 soles a month will pay 30 percent. (Lima 
Global de Television in Spanish 0100 GMT 4 Jan 94)

<F P=106> ["Special report" by Darci Higobassi] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso stated 
on 10 January in Sao Paulo that the government has approved the 
importation of 1 million metric tons of Canadian wheat as a 
strategic action under its policy of supervising the 
availability of foodstuffs on the market, something that will 
have a positive effect on the price of bread and manioc meal. 
The importation of the wheat, which is under the control of a 
pool [preceding word in English] of flour mills, could amount to 
1.2 million metric tons at a cost of $15 to $20 per ton, a price 
much lower than Argentine wheat. 
  "There is no risk of a lack of foodstuffs because the 
Finance 
and Agriculture Ministries are carefully supervising the 
agricultural market and there will be no disruption of the 
harvest," Cardoso guaranteed. He also believes the estimate of 
42-percent inflation in January is pure "speculation. I am 
going to repeat what I have already said: The number 42 is a 
shoe size; therefore, there is no room for it." He said there 
will be no advance implementation of the real value unit (URV), 
explaining that the government will not begin to think about 
the URV until Congress approves the budget. Cardoso made these 
remarks during the morning of 10 January when he was interviewed 
on the "Business [preceding word in English] Program" broadcast 
over Manchete Television, which will be aired on 16 January. 
  The minister indicated that on 13 January he will meet with 
the board of directors of the National Bank for Economic and 
Social Development (BNDES) in order to define the new policy for 
the northeast, which has an estimated $1 billion for the 
construction of highways, the planning of hydraulic resources, 
and general infrastructure services. 
  Cardoso also indicated that during January, President Itamar 
Franco will approve the creation of a permanent working group 
that will draft an extended administrative reform. The Planning 
Ministry, the Federal Administrative Secretariat, and the 
Civilian Household have been charged with this task under the 
Finance Ministry's supervision. The Social Welfare and Regional 
Integration Ministries will disappear, but other offices will be 
transferred to other areas.

<F P=106> [Article by Nancy Pazos copyrighted by CLARIN] </F>
  [Text] Early yesterday morning the secretary general of the 
presidency, Eduardo Bauza, received the best birthday gift he 
could have hoped for: the leaders of Argentina's most important 
chambers of commerce came in person to his Casa Rosada office to 
announce their support for the political agreement that Carlos 
Menem and Raul Alfonsin sealed last Sunday in Olivos. 
  The meeting began at 0830 sharp with almost perfect 
attendance. The only person missing was the head of the 
Argentine Rural Society, Eduardo de Zavalia, who--as his peers 
explained later--could not postpone an already scheduled trip to 
Brazil. 
  Consequently, those attending were: Jorge Blanco Villegas 
(Argentine Industrial Union); Roberto Sanmartino (Argentine 
Union of Construction Enterprises); Monir Madcur (Argentine 
Construction Board); and Jorge Berardi (Commodity Exchange). 
  Other members of the delegation were: Francisco Macri 
(Association of Automotive Manufacturers); Jorge di Fiori 
(Argentine Chamber of Commerce); Osvaldo Cornide (Coordinating 
Agency for Commercial Activities); and Eduardo Escassany 
(Banking Association of Buenos Aires). 
  The meeting lasted until exactly 0940, enough time for just 
one round of coffee or tea and pastries, and a short individual 
explanation of the benefits of this political accord for the 
economic future. 
  On that point, nobody heard or said anything different from 
what was stated last Monday, when these associations expressed 
their approval of Menem and Alfonsin's handshake the day before, 
thus opening the way toward constitutional reform. 
  Some of them, like Macri and Madcur, expressed hope that in 
the midterm period this consensus would move to the economic 
terrain in a more effective manner, but both Bauza and the other 
business leaders hastened to recommend that "for now it is 
better not to introduce points of disagreement." 
  What was explicitly stated was a request from the secretary 
general to his visitors: help drum up support for the reform 
bill, not only among the business community, but also by 
speaking out to help mitigate points of resistance in public 
opinion. 
  The businessmen agreed to do so, and some even said they 
would call upon their contacts among the Radicals to persuade 
the most reluctant leaders about this before the party 
convention on 3 December so that the convention will give a 
mandate to the UCR [Radical Civic Union] deputies to vote for 
the reform as a way to strengthen the agreement. 
  At about the middle of the meeting, Bauza let drop a phrase 
that sounded more like a suggestion than a question: "Are you 
also going to meet with Alfonsin to show him your satisfaction 
with the agreement?" he asked. 
  The businessmen had actually already discussed that 
possibility, but it was a cause of some controversy. It seems 
that some of the leaders are more "pro-Menem" than others. They 
are the ones who said that "it is not necessary" to have a 
meeting with the former president, for the simple reason 
that--at least for now--they did not visit Carlos Menem. 
  On the other side were those who believe the meeting with 
the 
Radical leader "is appropriate" in order to maintain balance in 
a situation like the one that brought them together yesterday. 
It now seems that this view has carried the day, since some of 
them assured CLARIN that the meeting with Alfonsin "will take 
place this week." 
  The moment of tension that arose in that part of the meeting 
was quickly dissipated. Bauza himself eased the climate by 
telling stories about the conclusion of the negotiations at 
Olivos. 
  All the businessmen said yesterday they had not been brought 
together by Bauza, but that the meeting had been arranged at the 
spontaneous initiative of some of the business leaders. "We set 
it up with three or four telephone calls," they explained. 
Still, it was obvious that the personal intervention of the 
secretary general had a great deal to do with the holding of the 
meeting (see following section). 
  However, reports about the meeting that this newspaper heard 
did not agree on one fairly important point. The majority of 
those contacted said they were attending the meeting 
representing their respective groups. 
<H5>  Bauza Seeks Supporters </H5>
  The breakfast meeting between Eduardo Bauza and Argentina's 
top business leaders did not come about spontaneously. The 
operation that ended with the visitors' public "approval" of the 
Olivos pact was the result of a political operation that began 
on the very day the private meeting between Carlos Menem and 
Raul Alfonsin came to light. 
  After the political stir aroused by the announcement of this 
first summit meeting, Alfonsin was not the only one who had to 
close ranks among his supporters. While the government did not 
need to line up its troops behind the accord, its principal 
operators did have to smooth things over with their economic and 
political associates who had been left on the sidelines by this 
maneuver. 
  So the secretary general of the presidency did not hesitate 
to telephone some of the friends of the government in the 
business community. On that same Monday when the news broke, a 
few privileged people began to hear in advance about the 
negotiations with the opposition. Bauza, in some way, wanted to 
resume the code of mutual "information loyalty" that they owed 
to each other. 
  Menem's preferred operator had begun a painstaking effort 
with the sector as soon as he entered his present office. It was 
he who had assigned the secretary of legal and technical 
affairs, Carlos Corach, the task of holding luncheon meetings 
once a week with a business group. 
  Starting on Monday, 7 (November) [as published], the circle 
of businessmen who were kept informed expanded daily along with 
the amount of news published. Bauza's final move toward the 
business establishment came on the very day of the accord. On 
that night Bauza gave up the roast lamb awaiting him at the home 
of Hugo Anzorreguy to tell, by telephone, the details of the 
meeting to the group of the elect. 
  Between one dialogue and the other, they mutually arranged 
yesterday's meeting. 
  In fact, the breakfast meeting was a way of returning mutual 
favors. For Bauza, it was because he thus became the favored 
contact of the business groups (a by no means inconsiderable 
factor in the government), and for the visitors, it was because 
they could demonstrate that the renowned national business 
community was not left "out in the cold" from a political accord 
that may go down in the history books.

  [Excerpts] Brasilia -- The United Kingdom yesterday 
celebrated the clinching of a $225 million contract to sell nine 
Super Lynx helicopters to the Brazilian Navy as well as a supply 
of spare parts to modernize the Navy's fleet of this same kind 
of helicopters. The sale, made by Westland Helicopters Ltd. 
from Somerset, was the best news heard yesterday in British 
business circles. The report was released yesterday at noon 
through the REUTER news agency, and was later broadcast during 
the evening television and radio newscasts despite the fact that 
the selling company had made no official comment on the deal. 
  Without citing its source for the information, REUTER 
asserts 
that the contract was signed on 23 December. Westland did not 
confirm the amount of money involved as cited in the radio and 
television reports. The unofficial figure was learned of on the 
floor of the London Stock Exchange, where the company's shares 
put in a strong performance. Westland's preferential shares 
climbed by 9 pence during the day, closing at 2.65 pounds, or 
$3.97. 
  The contract signed between the British supplier and the 
Brazilian Navy establishes that the equipment will be delivered 
over a period of two years. During the same period of time 
Westland must modernize the Lynx helicopter fleet operated by 
the Brazilian Navy. [passage omitted] 
  The nine Super Lynx helicopters purchased by the Navy will 
be 
used for war exercises on the Niteroi class frigates. The 
aircraft were purchased thanks to a line of credit of 111.505 
million pounds granted by the Brazilian American Merchant Bank. 
According to Captain of Sea and War Kleber Luciano de Assis, 
Navy public relations director, the first unit will be delivered 
in June 1996.

  [Text] Brasilia -- PT [Workers Party] President Luis Inacio 
Lula da Silva and Deputy Miguel Arraes (PE [Pernambuco]), 
president of the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party], on 11 January 
announced their intention of a coalition for the upcoming 
October general elections. According to Lula da Silva, the 
PT-PSB alliance that will be approved in a few days during a 
meeting of the two parties' executive boards will be a national 
alliance. Lula da Silva said he still does not know who will be 
the ticket's vice presidential candidate for the presidential 
elections, but he praised Senator Jose Paulo Bisol, who was his 
running mate in the 1989 elections. 
  Da Silva said: "I am not the one to choose but Bisol has 
become a better known and consolidated figure in national 
politics." Lula da Silva also said he hopes to attract other 
parties such as the PPS [People's Socialist Party] and the PCdoB 
[Communist Party of Brazil] for a large leftist front but he 
discarded agreements with the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] and the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], which have their 
own candidates. He said: "[PDT leader Leonel] Brizola has shown 
some repulsion for the PT and said more than once that he is a 
candidate and is not interested in making alliances."

<F P=106> [Report by Alejandro Gomez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 6 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina said today that 1994 offers no special prospects 
for changes in Cuba's relationship with the United States. 
  During a news conference shortly before departing on a tour 
of five African nations, Robaina pointed out that Cuba cannot 
decide whether there will be changes in those relations because 
the island has defined its position, and it is now up to 
Washington to change its policies. 
  We should not be overly enthusiastic about the absence of 
aggressive language because this can be the case even while, as 
is currently happening, the blockade is intensified. Under such 
conditions there is not room for much, Robaina said. 
  Regarding a list of political prisoners given to American 
clergyman Jesse Jackson during a recent visit to Havana, Robaina 
pointed out that he has categorically asserted that Cuba may 
have many concerns, but it does not work through requests or 
lists. The fact that at a given moment, under certain 
circumstances we agreed to this in 1984 [as received] does not 
mean that it will always be the case. 
  Nevertheless, Robaina pointed out, Jackson requested 
information concerning certain cases and the government provided 
him with the information. He did not request that anyone be 
released. 
  The Cuban diplomat underscored that Cuba was not under any 
obligation to present the list and does not have to respond for 
the people listed, because their situation does not exactly 
depend on a request or on the difficulties that may emerge 
during a negotiations process. 
  Robaina added that the first thing that is evaluated during 
a 
penal process is what the person's current situation is, what 
sentence he received, and how he has behaved. It is not a 
phenomenon based on lists because there are many lists floating 
around the world but there is a lack of information concerning 
the people who are on those lists, he said. 
  Regarding Cuba's relations with other areas of the world, 
Robaina said that 1994 offers new opportunities which may not 
necessarily be for the better or very lofty or numerous. 
  Today we have a situation in Latin America that we did not 
have in the past; we have formed a joint commission with the 
Caribbean that did not exist in 1993, we are about to 
participate in a technical meeting to create the Association of 
Caribbean States, and we are preparing the Fourth 
Spanish-speaking Latin American summit scheduled to be held in 
Cartagena. 
  Furthermore, Robaina added, we recently held a meeting with 
representatives from the European Parliament which is a sign of 
a new relationship with that community. 
  We have not asked anyone to share in what we are doing, 
Robaina underscored, adding that it is not necessary to share 
what Cuba is doing but to respect it. Cuba, he said, is willing 
to maintain exchanges with the entire world, including the 
United States. 
  Concerning his two-week tour of five countries on the 
African 
continent, the foreign minister said it will help to strengthen 
Cuba's already magnificent relations with the governments of 
those countries. 
  Although an expansion of Cuban civil cooperation with those 
states is not expected, Robaina pointed out that Cuba might 
cooperate with them in areas such as health, education, culture 
and sports. 
  Robaina pointed out that he basically wants to brief those 
countries on the island's current reality and identify areas in 
which relations could be strengthened, especially economic 
relations which, due to the current opening, offer magnificent 
investment opportunities for African businessmen. 
  Regarding the internal situation in Angola -- one of the 
countries he is scheduled to visit -- Robaina pointed out that 
it is up to the Angolan people to find a solution. 
  In response to a question regarding Cuba's position on the 
negotiations process in South Africa, Robaina said that his 
country is closely following it. 
  During this first trip to Africa since his appointment in 
April, the Cuban foreign minister will make official visits to 
Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Namibia, in that order. 
  Prior to his arrival in Accra, capital of Ghana, Robaina 
will 
take advantage of a brief stopover in Zurich to meet with Swiss 
officials from the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and 
Foreign Economic Relations Ministry, PRENSA LATINA was told by 
Tomas Lorenzo, head of Robaina's office. 
  Robaina, accompanied by a small entourage, will meet with 
President Jerry Rawlings (Ghana), Jose Eduardo Dos Santos 
(Angola), Robert Mugabe (Zimbabwe), Frederick Chiluba (Zambia) 
and Sam Nujoma (Namibia).

  [Text] Havana, 6 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina stated today that he trusts the Mexican people 
will be able to find the best and least traumatic solution to 
the armed conflict that has broken out in the southern State of 
Chiapas. 
  "Cuba is maintaining absolute respect for something which 
has 
been the main feature of our foreign policy -- that the Mexicans 
may find the best solution to the internal problems which have 
developed at this time," Robaina added during a news conference 
shortly before starting on an official visit to Switzerland and 
five African nations. 
  For the past six days at least 12 communities located 
throughout the Mexican State of Chiapas have been the scene of 
clashes between the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) and 
government troops. 
  With respect to reports appearing in the Chilean newspaper 
EL 
MERCURIO related to that country's government not reestablishing 
diplomatic relations with Havana before 21 March, the Cuban 
foreign minister pointed out that Cuba is not "impatient or 
proposing any date or deadline. 
  "It is a decision that only the Chilean Government can make 
whenever it considers it convenient and we respect that," the 
Cuban minister stated. 
  When asked about Cuba's presence at the new Honduran 
president's inauguration scheduled to take place on 27 January, 
Robaina indicated that his country had not yet been invited. 
Nevertheless, if there is an invitation, he indicated, Cuba 
will not be absent. 
  "In any Latin American setting our country will not turn 
down 
an opportunity or an invitation," the Cuban minister emphasized. 
  In reference to prospective relations between Cuba and the 
United States in 1994, Robaina believes that there will be no 
substantial changes. He added that even though Washington's 
tone toward Havana has been less aggressive, a more severe 
blockade is still in place. 
  On the other hand, he mentioned new possibilities in 
political and economic ties with Europe, Latin American, and the 
Caribbean. 
  The Cuban foreign minister said that "Cuba's situation is 
very difficult, but we are not at a dead end yet." 
  Robaina believes that although 1994 will not entail any 
significant changes in the country's internal situation with 
respect to 1993, it may be that the [downward] spiral will begin 
to reverse.

<F P=106> [Report by special envoy Eduardo Rodriguez Baz] </F>
  [Text] Bern, 8 Jan (PL) -- Jacob Kellenberger, the Swiss 
secretary of state for foreign affairs [name and title as 
received], was very interested in creating legal conditions to 
promote investments in Cuba originating in his country. 
  During an interview that lasted more than an hour with Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Kellenberger said he was also 
interested in learning about the dispute between the United 
States and Cuba. He expressed his government's sympathy with 
the complex situation the Latin American country is experiencing. 
  The Cuban foreign minister, who made a technical stop in 
Bern 
before beginning his tour of five African nations, told PRENSA 
LATINA that, although informal, his stay had been very important 
and fruitful for the development of future bilateral ties. 
  Besides his meeting with Kellenberger, who is also the 
political director of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, 
the Caribbean minister met with Heinrich Reimann, the ambassador 
and chief of the Department of African, Middle East, Asian, and 
Latin American Affairs at the Swiss Foreign Ministry. 
  He visited the parliament of the Swiss Confederation, where 
he was briefed on that body's organization. 
  Local authorities expressed their willingness to hold talks. 
In response, Robaina invited the secretary of state to visit 
Havana. 
  Switzerland and Cuba are working on a bilateral agreement to 
promote and protect investments, similar to those Cuba has 
signed with other European countries. 
  The Cuban foreign minister saw Nicolas Imboden, the 
ambassador of the Federal Department of Public Economy [name and 
title as received], before concluding his brief stay in this 
capital. Imboden, who is also in charge of commerce and 
investment, expressed his interest in some sort of trade 
exchange with Cuba. 
  Robaina gave interviews to BERNER ZEITUNG, the leading 
newspaper here, and Radio Switzerland International. 
  The Cuban minister will arrive in Ghana on Sunday, on the 
first leg of a venture through Africa that will take him to the 
People's Republic of Angola, then on to Zimbabwe, Zambia, and 
finally Namibia.

  [Text] Accra, 10 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina arrived today for an official visit to Ghana 
during his first tour to five African countries since his 
appointment in April last year. 
  The Caribbean island's foreign minister was welcomed at 
Kotoka International Airport by his Ghanaian counterpart, Obed 
Asamoah, and Juan Carretero, Havana's ambassador in Accra. 
  Interviewed by local media, Robaina said one of the goals of 
the trip is to explain the domestic situation in Cuba and 
changes being implemented in the economic sector. 
  He said his country's government is interested in knowing 
about the situation in Ghana, a country with which it maintains 
a fluid trade which stands out within the context of the 
so-called Black Continent. 
  Referring to the Latin American country's planned foreign 
policy for 1994, the head of Cuban diplomacy said it must be 
different, because the situation so demands. 
  The key is to have the ability to exist in a constantly 
changing world and to ensure that our views are known at the 
international level, he said. 
  The foreign minister said that despite predictions by the 
international media in 1993, his country is living, working, and 
has opted to counter the adverse situation it is facing with 
many efforts, without sacrificing sacred achievements, such as 
in health and education. 
  Referring to this, he said 1993 should go down in history as 
the most difficult year for the revolution, which was born in 
1959, but 1994 is the beginning of an upward trend. 
  During his 48-hour stay in Accra, Robaina will meet with 
Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlins; Justice Daniel Annan, 
parliament leader; the foreign minister; and Richard Kwame 
Peprah, energy and mines minister and chairman of the 
Cuban-Ghanaian Mixed Commission. 
  He will also meet with members of various friendship 
associations and the Cuban ambassadors to Cape Verde, 
Guinea-Bissau, Nigeria, Benin, and Burkina Faso. 
  The foreign minister and his delegation will leave on 
Tuesday 
for Angola, the second phase of his two-week tour, which also 
includes Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia.

  [Text] Accra, 10 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina and Ghanaian Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah spoke today 
in favor of supporting the Nonalligned Movement (NAM) nations as 
an independent force currently facing neocolonialism in a 
unipolar world. 
  Robaina and Asamoah today held a one-hour-plus meeting 
during 
which they exchanged ideas on the world situation, and in 
particular, their respective nations. 
  The foreign minister from the Caribbean nation arrived 
yesterday in this capital as part of a two-week tour of the 
continent that also includes Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and 
Namibia, in that order. 
  During their official conversations, Robaina offered an 
overall outlook on his country's economic and political 
situation, as well as the changes being implemented in the wake 
of the Soviet Union's demise and the stepping up of the blockade 
imposed on the island by the United States more than three 
decades ago. 
  In this regard, he explained that his government has opened 
doors to foreign investment under Washington's relentless 
persecution to hamper these negotiations. 
  The visitor indicated that more than 100 foreign companies 
are established on Cuban territory and one of 1994's priorities 
is to promote Latin American and Caribbean investments. 
  When referring to the conflict with the United States, the 
Cuban diplomat ruled out improved relations, although he 
remarked that as time goes by more and more sectors of U.S. 
society oppose the blockade. 
  Robaina expressed his appreciation for Ghana's position with 
regard to the Caribbean island in diverse international forums 
and particularly at the United Nations. 
  Meanwhile, Asamoah emphasized that this support, besides 
being based on friendship, is a matter of principle at a time 
when there is an attempt to force Cuba to change its political 
system. 
  We do not want the small nations to be pressured by the 
Western powers, stressed the African minister. It is very 
clear, he said, that the West tries to control the Third World 
through the UN Security Council, demonstrating the absence of 
consistency in this body. 
  To conclude, he expressed his satisfaction for being able to 
count on good friends such as Cuba. 
  The Cuban minister arrived in Accra on a two-day official 
visit accompanied by Alberto Rodriguez Arufe, coordinator of the 
Cuban Communist Party's Central Committee International 
Relations Department and by other Foreign Ministry officials. 
  During today's visit the Cuban delegation laid a wreath at 
the Kwame Nkruman monument, father of Ghana's independence. The 
wreath was received by Daniel Anam, president of the ruling 
party National Democratic Congress, and by its general secretary 
Huudu Yahaya. 
  Before travelling to Angola, Robaina met with Ghanaian 
President Jerry Rawlings. With a population of over 15 million 
people, Ghana, a former British colony, is Cuba's first trading 
partner in Africa.

  [Text] Accra, 10 Jan (PL) -- Captain Kojo Tsikata, member 
of Ghana's Council of State, today voiced his concern over the 
situation in Angola and the future of the ruling party, the 
Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). 
  During an interview with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina, the old politician charged that Western governments -- 
without mentioning names -- are exerting pressure to accommodate 
in power Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the armed UNITA [National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola]. 
  Tsikata criticized the support some governments are still 
giving the Angolan armed rebel group that was defeated in the 
September 1992 first-ever multiparty elections considered valid 
and just by the United Nations. 
  In another part of his conversation with the Cuban foreign 
minister -- who arrived yesterday in this city for an official 
two- day visit -- Tsikata regretted the tensions prevailing in 
Liberia, where Ghana has sent troops to contribute in the search 
for a political solution to the crisis in this West African 
state. 
  Likewise, he encouraged the Nigerian leaders to prevent an 
outbreak of violence in that country.

  [Text] Accra, 11 Jan (PL) -- Today, Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina concluded his official, two-day visit to Ghana 
after meeting with President Jerry Rawlings, with whom he 
discussed the situation in Cuba and the latest African events. 
  Robaina presented a message from President Fidel Castro to 
the Ghanaian president during this meeting. 
  During his two-day stay in Accra, the visiting minister also 
met with Ghanaian Foreign Minister Obed Asamoah, with whom he 
studied the international situation and, specifically, the 
problems of their Third World countries. 
  Both officials agreed on the need to maintain the Nonaligned 
Movement as an independent force to confront the neocolonialism 
that governs the world's unipolarity. 
  During his talks with the Ghananian hosts, Captain Kojo 
Tsikata, member of the state council in Ghana, asserted that 
they greatly valued Cuba's efforts to maintain its dignity and 
to make its own decisions. 
  Tsikata also emphasized Ghana is willing to continue making 
its modest contributions to helping Cuba do away with its 
current difficulties. 
  Roberto Robaina explained the measures adopted by his 
country's authorities following the collapse of the socialist 
bloc and the disintegration of the Soviet Union to the Ghanaian 
officials. 
  Cuban delegation sources have reported the Cuban foreign 
minister will now travel to Angola, a country with which the 
Cuban Government and people maintain historic ties of friendship. 
  Angolan Foreign Minister Venacio da Moura asserted today, in 
exclusive statements to PRENSA LATINA, that those ties continue 
unaltered despite the ongoing changes and the war in Angola. 
  Da Moura highlighted Havana's cooperation with Luanda and 
emphasized that the blood shed by their Cuban brothers to defend 
the territorial integrity of this southern country when it was 
invaded by South African forces in 1975. 
  Robaina is conducting his first tour to this continent, 
which 
will also include Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia.

  [Text] Santiago, Chile, 12 Jan (PL) -- Chilean Foreign 
Minister Enrique Silva Cimma today had a private meeting with 
Humberto Hernandez, Cuba's recently appointed general consul to 
Santiago, with whom he discussed the current situation and 
bilateral ties. 
  At the end of the meeting Hernandez said that the two 
governments have assessed as positive the evolution of relations 
since their reestablishment at consular and economic trade 
levels. 
  Of course, he noted, in such a short time it is not possible 
to make an in-depth analysis of the issues, however, we agreed 
that we have made progress in the economic and trade fields as 
well as in political understanding on overall issues such as 
Latin America's mandatory integration. 
  When questioned by reporters on comments published in the 
press with regard to possible reestablishment of diplomatic 
relations, Hernandez said that his government's position is to 
have total patience, noting that Chile must take this step when 
it considers it convenient. 
  Hernandez added that it is not up to Cuba to take these 
specific steps, as it is not our policy to impose preset 
conditions for the establishment of diplomatic or consular 
relations with other nations. 
  Hernandez noted that in effect there is interest on the part 
of Cuba to resume ties, while remarking that Chile and Cuba are 
two brotherly nations whose relations have advanced in many 
fields. Diplomatic relations, therefore, "would be a step that 
we would regard as normal and logical," he noted. 
  With regard to the delay by Patricio Aylwin's government in 
taking that foreseen step, the Cuban consul recalled that there 
is still one month to go before the change of government and 
that Cuba will continue waiting without anxiety. 
  Nevertheless, he noted that this is an issue of utmost 
importance for the island as it would imply higher level 
relations that in turn would favor increased economic and trade 
relations. 
  Changing the subject, Hernandez talked about the difficult 
conditions that Cuba is currently experiencing. However, he 
expressed his belief that with effort, intelligence, and 
international solidarity, the island will get ahead without 
changing the spirit of its socialist regime.

<F P=106> [Report by Ruben G. Abelenda] </F>
  [Text] Luanda, 10 Jan (PL) -- On 10 January, Angolan 
Foreign Minister Venacio da Moura described relations between 
his country and Cuba, which he said are historical and 
invariable, as excellent. 
  In an exclusive interview for PRENSA LATINA, da Moura said 
the ties between Luanda and Havana have remained at a constant 
level, as they are founded on solid relations based on mutual 
respect between two sovereign states. 
  He added that cooperation continues to be privileged and 
advantageous, but admitted that due to current conditions, the 
economic ties have not reached the level both countries and 
peoples would hope. 
  Commenting on the upcoming visit to Angola this week by his 
Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina, da Moura said it is aimed at 
seeking new ways to increase future cooperation, taking into 
consideration the complex situation both countries are facing. 
  He added that Robaina's visit in Luanda will contribute to 
"keeping alive the flame of solidarity that started when the 
Cuban and Angolan people together shed their blood in defense of 
Angola's sovereignty." 
  He stressed that despite the political and economic 
transformations in Angola during the past three years as a 
result of changes taking place in the world, the governments of 
Luanda and Havana have tried to maintain bilateral relations at 
the same level. 
  We would like those relations to be even better, he said, 
but 
the current war in Angola caused by the armed UNITA [National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola] organization, as 
well as problems in Cuba due to the unjust commercial and 
financial blockade it faces, to a large extent limit our 
economic ties. 
  Nevertheless, he added, those difficulties have not 
prevented 
our mutual cooperation from growing. In no way have they 
weakened that cooperation, and they will not be an obstacle to 
continuing relations on the same path they have followed over 
the past 20 years, he noted. 
  During the interview, da Moura stressed that the Angolan 
Government will continue supporting and defending Cuba at all 
international forums. 
  That has been and will continue to be our government's 
position, he stressed. 
  Da Moura praised Cubans saying that "their firmness is their 
best defense against the constant aggressions and difficulties 
they have faced during the past years." 
  In Cuba's struggle against destabilizing actions a key 
factor 
has been the nation's solid leadership headed by President Fidel 
Castro, da Moura concluded.

  [Text] Luanda, 13 Jan (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina arrived today in this capital for a two-day 
official visit during which he and the Angolan authorities will 
discuss future relations between their two countries. 
  On his arrival in Luanda from Ghana, the site of the first 
stopover in his first African tour, Robaina was greeted by 
Angolan Foreign Minister Venacio da Moura, who will be his main 
host here. 
  Other important local government leaders and Cuban 
Ambassador 
to Angola Reinaldo Calviac [name as received] were also present 
at the welcome ceremony. 
  According to an official source, the Cuban foreign minister 
will be received by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. 
He will also meet with Prime Minister Marcelino Moco as well as 
with Franca Van Dunem, president of the Angolan Parliament. 
  Robaina is also scheduled to meet with the Cuban community 
in 
Angola, approximately 300 persons, and he will be making other 
contacts. 
  During an exclusive interview granted to PRENSA LATINA this 
week, da Moura said that Robaina's visit will contribute to 
maintaining the same historic level of excellent ties, 
friendship, and cooperation that exist between the two states. 
  He added that his visit will also serve to keep the torch of 
solidarity burning that the Cuban people lighted when Cuban 
blood was spilled alongside that of the Angolan people in 
defending the sovereignty and territorial integrity of this 
country. 
  At the conclusion of his stay in Luanda, Robaina will travel 
to Harare, Zimbabwe, the third stop in his tour, which also 
includes Namibia and Zambia.

<F P=106> [Report by Eduardo Rodriguez-Baz] </F>
  [Text] Luanda, 13 Jan (PL) -- Angolan Foreign Minister 
Venacio da Moura affirmed here today that his country views as a 
privilege the fact that the first foreign visitor to Angola in 
1994 has been Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. 
  At the beginning of official talks between the two leaders 
today, da Moura said that Robaina's visit has taken place at a 
particularly complex moment for the Angolan people because of 
the war being waged by the opposition National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. 
  The Angolan minister noted the peace efforts his government 
is making to put an end to the instability produced by the 
domestic conflict, which UNITA rekindled more than one year ago 
after failing in the first multiparty elections. 
  Referring to relations with Cuba, da Moura said that in 
spite 
of difficulties, Angola will work to strengthen the historic 
ties of cooperation with the Caribbean island. 
  Robaina said that his 48-hour visit to this capital forms 
part of a diplomatic offensive in a changing world. Robaina 
stated that the Cuban authorities are working to establish the 
country in the framework in which it belongs. 
  He said: We cannot speak of Cuban diplomacy without 
mentioning Africa and Angola, with which we are united by 
fraternal and traditional ties, in particular, he said. 
  During his first visit to Luanda, the Cuban foreign minister 
has already spoken with the Cuban medical and paramedical 
personnel who work in an important metropolitan hospital and 
plans to meet with Cuban experts in other fields. 
  Today, as part of his busy agenda, Robaina will meet with 
Prime Minister Marcolino Moco and tomorrow he will be received 
by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. 
  Robaina will also meet with Franca Van Dunem, president of 
the Angolan Parliament. 
  Angola is Robaina's second stopover in his African journey. 
He has already visited Ghana and will be going to Zimbabwe, 
Zambia, and Namibia.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Jan (PL) -- John Savage, the prime 
minister of the Canadian Province of Nova Scotia, will end a 
business trip to Cuba today after meeting last night with Cuban 
President Fidel Castro, with whom he talked about trade, 
international development, and the environment. 
  It was a "marvelous visit which our delegation greatly 
appreciated," Savage said at a news conference. The Canadian 
official was accompanied by a large group of businessmen from 17 
firms from the important Canadian Atlantic region. 
  During the visit, which the prime minister termed as "very 
successful," several trade agreements were reached and 
enterprise projects with Canadian capital were drafted in the 
areas of industry, agriculture, tourism, and services. 
  "From our viewpoint, and that of the delegation, the trip 
was 
very advantageous and it was really worthwhile," said the 
Canadian politician, who won the post of Nova Scotian prime 
minister for the Liberal Party last May. 
  Savage, a medical doctor who is the first Canadian 
provincial 
prime minister to visit Cuba in 17 years, described Fidel 
Castro as a "hospitable, very vigorous" man and a politician 
"with a vast knowledge and with a wide range of topics to 
discuss. 
  "It was a fluid, light, and interesting conversation which 
we 
enjoyed greatly," the Nova Scotia prime minister added. 
  Meanwhile, Dr. Patricia Lane, president of Lane Environment 
Ltd. consulting firm, told PRENSA LATINA about her satisfaction 
with the meeting with Fidel Castro, during which she was 
"greatly impressed," she said. 
  "I have known and met with many outstanding politicians and 
I 
have worked in many countries, but I have never met a world 
leader with so much knowledge about the environment and 
sustainable development," the businesswoman said. 
  Her company agreed to work in association with the Cubans in 
the development of ecological tourism, a form of tourism that is 
currently gaining popularity in the world, "to which Cuba has 
much to contribute because of its wealth of natural resources."

<F P=106> [Report by Martin Hacthoun] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 10 Jan (PL) -- John Savage, prime minister 
of the Canadian territory of Nova Scotia, has initiated an 
official round of interviews here with Cuban authorities. 
Savage is heading a delegation of businessmen interested in 
initiating trade relations with the island. 
  The group accompanying Savage is comprised of 
representatives 
of 16 Nova Scotian companies. Nova Scotia is a territory on 
Canada's Atlantic coast. The entrepreneurs see Cuba as a place 
with real business prospects. 
  "Taking into account the business opportunities available in 
Cuba, the entrepreneurs accompanying me are very eager and 
interested in doing serious business with the island," Savage 
said. Savage is making the first working visit to Cuba in 17 
years by a provincial chief of state. 
  The delegation was welcomed by Foreign Trade Minister 
Ricardo 
Cabrisas Ruiz and Carlos Martinez Salsamendi, president of the 
Cuban Chamber of Commerce, who briefed the visitors on the 
current economic situation in Cuba, its problems, and 
development prospects, as well as on the availability of capital 
investment opportunities. 
  Savage, who became prime minister with the Liberal Party in 
a 
landslide victory last May, said that the results of the trade 
probe and discussions the group expects to complete will surely 
be mutually beneficial. 
  There are now 400 companies that maintain trade relations 
with the island. There are 112 companies or joint ventures in 
operation, 22 of which are with the Canadian capital. 
  Canadian Ambassador to Cuba Mark Entwistle commented that 
the 
Canadian entrepreneurs have a growing interest in the Cuban 
market, where they find commercial and investment stability. 
  Cuba is Canada's fourth most important trade partner in 
Latin 
America, and first in the Caribbean and Central America. 
  During their stay, Savage and his commercial delegation will 
also be greeted by Lionel Soto, vice president of the Council of 
Ministers; Nicolas Rodriguez, the acting foreign minister; the 
ministers of health, fishing industry, and agriculture; and 
Ricardo Alarcon, the president of Parliament. They will also 
visit centers of scientific and economic interest. 
  Cuba maintains certain agreements, especially in fishing, 
with the Atlantic Province of Nova Scotia, whose Halifax Bay is 
the world's second largest and is the site of heavy trade 
traffic. Now Cuba will be able to broaden such ties to other 
areas.

  [Text] Havana, 9 Jan (PL) -- Anbdul Magid Osman [name as 
received], director of the Managerial Development Program of the 
Bureau of Policies and Procedures of the UN Development Program, 
UNDP, arrived in Havana on 9 January to obtain firsthand 
information on Cuban problems and to hear requests from local 
authorities. 
  In his first visit to Cuba, Osman reaffirmed the UNDP's 
desire to help Cuba enter the international market. The third 
training course for Cuban experts offered by the UNDP has been 
scheduled for this year. 
  Osman will be in Havana until Friday [14 January]. During 
his visit he will meet with top Cuban Government officials. 
  Osman was born in Maputo, Mozambique, where he occupied 
several ministries from 1975 to 1991, including the Ministries 
of Finance and Mineral Resources; he also served as secretary of 
state for coal and oil resources. 
  Meanwhile, Joachim von Braunmuhl, UNDP representative in 
Cuba, told PRENSA LATINA that the training courses are aimed at 
introducing local experts to more modern international business 
and financial operations. 
  Toward that end, he added, the first training course was 
held 
in Cuba in 1991 and a second one in 1992 with the participation 
of 280 economists from various parts of the country at a cost of 
$200,000. 
  Now, Braunmuhl said, the third phase of the training on 
international commercial and financial techniques has been 
scheduled for Cuban experts who will transmit their knowledge to 
other professionals in their respective provinces. 
  He announced that there are other UNDP projects related to 
Cuba this year which are being coordinated, the details of which 
will be known later on.

  [Text] Havana, 8 Jan (PL) -- Pedro Ross, secretary general 
of the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) announced today that the 
federation will analyze the country's main financial problems 
this month. 
  Ross reported that, in the first stage, approximately 
485,000 
union leaders will discuss ways to solve the internal financial 
problem, one of the most complex and important problems with 
regard to the island's serious economic situation. 
  In statements to the local press, the worker leader said the 
workers' opinions must be gathered because "they are the 
backbone of everything that may be done with regard to this 
topic." 
  He also mentioned that, at the last session of the Cuban 
Parliament -- 27 and 28 December -- President Fidel Castro said 
none of the measures that Cuba may need to adopt can be decided 
without the support and consensus of the workers. 
  The Cuban deputies did not reach agreements because -- as 
was 
learned -- they previously decided to carry out a profound 
consultation and clarification process among the entire 
population and later convoke an extraordinary meeting of the 
parliament to continue debating the affair, with a higher level 
of information. 
  For the parliament members and the country's directorate the 
meeting served as a way to reflect and exchange ideas on how to 
improve the existing financial imbalance. 
  In this regard, it was learned that the excess circulating 
currency amounted to over 10 billion pesos (the same amount in 
dollars, according to the official exchange rate), the subsidies 
due to losses in 1993 amounted to 4.6 billion pesos, and the 
state budget deficit amounted to 4.2 billion pesos, most of it 
in subsidies. 
  Of those, the excess circulating currency is the most 
harmful 
as it contributes to decreasing efficiency, decreasing 
productivity, as well as declining labor discipline. 
  Some of the solutions viewed by the Cuban deputies were: 
changing the currency, implementing a new tax system and price 
policy, as well as charging for some services that are currently 
offered gratuitously.

  [Text] Havana, 5 Jan (PL) -- Cuba requires today the 
adoption of a new economic model, which existing circumstances 
are already causing to emerge, said here Pedro Monreal, 
investigator at the nongovernmental Center for Studies on 
America (CEA). 
  The country's conditions of accumulation have changed 
radically. This demands the elaboration of a new concept, an 
instrument that may make it possible to understand why the 
economy can or cannot grow, said the specialist in statements to 
PRENSA LATINA. 
  The economic model, he said, must be basically understood as 
an analytical abstraction in which there are several levels: the 
economy's macro additions [macroagregados] (investment and 
consumption), the sector's structure, the international 
situation and insertion (under what conditions it takes place), 
and the institutional framework. 
  He said many economists limit the concept of the model to 
this last aspect, in which two basic things prevail: 
organization and norms. 
  According to Monreal, even if the most urgent task of the 
Cuban Government were to be the adoption of a package of 
measures aimed at correcting the island's financial problems, 
the most important job will be in-depth economic restructuring. 
  According to estimates from the Finance Ministry, the Cuban 
budget deficit in 1993 amounted to 4.2 billion pesos (the same 
amount in dollars per the official exchange rate) and excess 
money in circulation surpassed 10 billion. 
  Cuba -- he said -- has a very open economy, whose structure 
was not designed to compete in the world market but to operate 
within another constitutional framework: that of the Council of 
Mutual Economic Aid, which it joined in 1972. 
  He added that within the economy there are competitive 
sectors, such as sugar, nickel, citrus, tourism, tobacco, rum, 
electronics, construction and engineering services, and some 
steel products, among other sectors. 
  There is a second front, not operating right now, but which 
could be if modernized and reduced. It is reflected in the 130 
investment opportunities offered by the State Committee of 
Economic Collaboration for Foreign Enterprises, as well as a 
third area (food production), which he considers nonoperational. 
  Monreal is one of those who believes that no proposal for a 
solution to the economic crisis can accept a squandering of the 
labor force, which is doubtlessly the country's most valuable 
resource, he stressed. 
  In this sense he recalled that a possible economic 
adjustment 
presupposes the elimination of state subsidies for production 
and therefore a reduction in jobs. 
  There are at least three options to the former: aspire to 
the 
growth of a new state sector that may reabsorb the unemployed, 
create new jobs in joint ventures, or expand cooperatives beyond 
the agricultural sector. 
  The two first options -- he said -- have the drawback of 
having very big external component, whereas the extension of 
cooperatives to other fields, such as services (particularly in 
trade) would create a new sector in the economy with a capacity 
for absorbing an important amount of labor. 
  It is convenient -- he stressed -- to exhaust these three 
possibilities without undermining the emerging private sector 
(some 87,000 citizens with licenses for self-employment) which 
technically is not capitalist, as it is a simple mercantile 
producer. 
  The structural changes in the economy will ultimately define 
future growth in that sector, as the constitutional framework 
has been undergoing modifications and today is much more 
flexible than two years ago, he said. 
  In socialist production -- he concluded -- there is now a 
growing presence of market mechanisms, understood to be stimuli 
for social cooperation, although often surrounded by the myth of 
the intrinsic impossibility for regulating them, which is 
totally untrue.

<F P=106> [Report by Moises Perez Mok] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 4 Jan (PL) -- Cuban tourism, the only sector 
to achieve a sustained annual growth in excess of 25 percent 
during the 1990's, is currently expected to play a leading role 
in helping to reverse the economic crisis in which the island 
finds itself. 
  If estimates prepared less than two years ago are fulfilled, 
Cuba will receive approximately 800,000 tourists in the next 12 
months. The figure represents a precursor to the great goal for 
1995 -- to welcome 1 million vacationers and surpass the 
$1-billion mark in gross revenues. 
  Unofficial estimates indicate that Cuba last year provided 
accommodations for approximately 600,000 foreign visitors and 
reached approximately $700 million in gross revenues, which 
represented an increase of between 26 and 28 percent compared 
with the previous year. 
  Cuba welcomed 340,000 summer visitors early in the 1990's. 
The number rose to 424,000 in 1991 and it surpassed the 
488,000-mark in 1992, according to statements made by Rafael Sed 
Perez, president of the National Institute of Tourism (Intur). 
  The tourism industry was mentioned barely three days ago by 
Cuban President Fidel Castro as one of the activities that would 
indicate -- with its results in 1994 -- the country's economic 
situation was showing signs of improvement. 
  The boom in this sector coincided, perhaps paradoxically, 
with the loss of the island's import capability, which was 
reduced from $8.139 billion in 1991 to $1.179 billion last year, 
when the sugar harvest -- approximately 4.28 million tons -- 
suffered an estimated loss of $450 million. 
  The Cuban authorities' confidence in a more efficient 
tourism 
industry is based, among other thingss, on foreign investors' 
increasing interest to establish their presence in that sector. 
  Nearly 10 European and American hotel chains have contracts 
for the management and marketing of hotel facilities, basically 
in the beach resort of Varadero, eastern Santiago de Cuba 
Province; Cayo Coco (in the country's central area); and in the 
capital. 
  These chains include Spain's Sol-Melia, Guitart Hotels, 
Kawama Caribbean Hotels, Iberostar, Raytur Caribe, and RIU; 
Germany's LTI; Jamaica's Superclubs; and Canada's Delta. 
  The latter officially inaugurated on Sunday the picturesque 
Delta-Sierra Mar Hotel, built on a ridge of the most important 
mountain range on the island, the Sierra Maestra, on the 
Caribbean sea. 
  The Cuban tourism sector's lodging capabilities for the 
remainder of 1994 should be approximately 25,000 rooms (it 
currently exploits about 20,000), a figure that barely 
represents 12 percent of the archipelago's potential -- an 
estimated 200,000 rooms. 
  The Seagull, Inc. tourism group alone plans to open two 
hotels early this year: The Coral, in Varadero, and the Rio de 
Mares, in northeastern Holguin Province. 
  Other elements that favor the development of this industry 
are an increase in the number of foreign airlines (29) which 
land at nine tourism centers in over 90 weekly flights, as well 
as the momentum gathered by the so-called cruise tourism in 1993. 
  Referring to the latter, there are great expectations 
concerning the advantages of opening a maritime navigation line 
between Havana and Jamaican and Mexican ports. This would, in 
turn, favor the development of multiple destination operations. 
  The cruise ship "Santiago de Cuba" is operated by the 
Havanatur, Inc., Acemex [not further identified], and Fratelli 
Consulich firms; and its launching, last December, had a great 
impact at the international level because it features a casino 
that only begins to operate when the ship is more than 12 
nautical miles from the Cuban coast.

<F P=106> [Report by Raimundo Lopez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 10 Jan (PL) -- The Cuban labor unions today 
announced a broad consultation process to influence the economic 
changes that are being studied to improve the country's internal 
finances that are characterized by a high fiscal deficit and 
excess circulating currency. 
  The Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), the only labor movement 
on the island, pointed out in a press note that the process will 
take place in two stages and conclude with grass-roots meetings 
at labor centers. 
  In the first stage more than 400,000 labor leaders will 
contribute their ideas and prepare for assemblies with union 
members, to which deputies of the National Assembly of the 
People's Government will be invited. 
  Parliament did an initial analysis of internal finances on 
28 
December when it was officially revealed that the fiscal deficit 
will reach 4.2 billion pesos -- which is equivalent to the same 
figure in dollars based on the official exchange rate -- and 
that there is a 10-billion-peso excess in circulating currency. 
  On that occasion the Legislative Branch did not adopt 
measures to tackle this situation, but the members agreed on the 
need to solve this delicate problem without resorting to 
neoliberal-type measures that involve high social costs. 
  The CTC announcement coincided with an editorial in the 
weekly TRABAJADORES, mouthpiece of the labor union, that 
strongly attacks the formality of the Cuban labor movement. 
  We can no longer bear, without growing impatient, the 
ritualistic and repetitive language of those who incessantly 
issue general slogans but fail to even touch the specific and 
objective reality that should be the basis for their actions, 
the publication underscored. 
  It also urged the labor unions to participate in all 
political battles, to "assume an offensive stand everywhere," 
and to censure indolence and negligence, lack of control over 
costs and expenditures, and unpunished deviation of resources. 
These are among the things that the publication condemned, 
considering them to be "signs of capitulation." 
  The weekly warned that the outcome of "the country's current 
epic" ... "compromises not only the fatherland's fate but also 
the workers' existence, decorum, dignity, and power." 
  In this regard, the publication urged them to contribute 
solutions and to adopt measures, some of which, if finally 
approved, might not be popular -- reduction of payroll, 
elimination of certain gratuities, and elimination of certain 
subsidies within an economic system that is described as 
paternalistic. 
  Labor unions in the capital city analyzed the issue for the 
first time over the weekend and agreed to focus their efforts on 
cost reduction and on obtaining higher net revenues. 
  As for the rationalization of surplus employees, CTC 
Secretary General Pedro Ross pointed out that this process is 
based on convincing arguments and reasons, not on decrees. 
  Ross said that there is a need to work with much prudence 
and 
to confront arbitrary actions. He added that labor union 
efforts with regard to the workers -- who are guaranteed a 60 
percent subsidy on their salaries -- will include the 
organization, attention, and defense of their rights. 
  In December, Parliament announced that special sessions 
would 
be held to discuss the country's financial situation following a 
broad analysis of the nation's social bases. 
  At noon today Legislative Branch President Ricardo Alarcon 
said on a radio program that "the people will be the key player 
of these actions," but he did not give details on the date of 
the upcoming parliament meeting.

  [Text] Mexico, 6 Jan (PL) -- Jose Fernandez de Cossio, 
Cuban ambassador to Mexico, spoke with local media about the 
ongoing events in Chiapas State, saying that a strong, stable, 
and prosperous Mexico is important to Cubans. 
  The Cuban diplomat said the matter is an internal affair and 
that his government agrees with the Mexican Government's efforts 
to find a peaceful solution in the region along the Guatemalan 
border. 
  Commenting on the 1 January operations of the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army (EZLN), Fernandez de Cossio said armed 
conflict and many other means used to solve problems are not the 
ultimate solution. He said the factors that necessitate such 
actions do not seem to be present in Mexico, where there is open 
dialogue. 
  Regarding certain accusations made by interested parties 
stating that Cuba was supplying weapons to the Chiapas rebels, 
the ambassador said they were mere fabrications of 
ill-intentioned people. 
  "They want to create turbulence in relations between Mexico 
and Cuba," Fernandez de Cossio said. "For a long time now, 
those relations have been founded on total respect for the 
principle of nonintervention." 
  Speaking of the meeting between President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari, the head of the local diplomatic community said that 
the president "seemed to be in control of the situation, 
well-informed, calm, and determined that negotiations and 
dialogue will lead the way to a solution." 
  The Cuban ambassador added that his country is highly 
concerned about the problem in southeastern Mexico. "We are 
reassured in knowing that the Mexican Government has taken steps 
to find a peaceful solution to this internal conflict. Mexico's 
friends must leave Mexicans to solve their own problems within a 
framework of peace and lawfulness," he stated.

  [Text] Havana, 6 Jan (PL) -- Faced with the most critical 
and complex situation of the past 34 years, Cuban society faces 
the challenge of reexamining and reformulating the foundation 
for national political consensus, according to an analyst at the 
American Studies Center. 
  Any process in that direction should be inseparable from a 
democratic, participative, and pluralist summons [convocatoria], 
Haroldo Dilla stated in his article "Cuba: The Crisis and New 
Articulation of Political Consensus," published recently in 
CUADERNOS DE NUESTRA AMERICA. 
  He explained that any plan for development bears a cost, 
while its viability depends to a large extent on the 
establishment of a national consensus on the advisability of the 
proposed objectives and the appropriate means of achieving them. 
  In this respect, he noted that the "capacity of the Cuban 
socialist program to guarantee strong popular support has been 
conditioned by diverse factors that cannot be solely or chiefly 
attributed to charismatic mediation of historical leadership 
summarized in the person of Fidel Castro." 
  The goals contained in the original revolutionary program -- 
public honesty, economic development, social justice, national 
independence, substantial democracy -- left little room for 
capitalist options, the expert from the nongovernment 
organization recalled. 
  He indicated that for over one decade (1959-70) popular 
political consensus was based on the implementation of measures 
to redistribute income and power and got off the ground through 
a system of extensive participation in national defense and the 
revolutionary program in the face of U.S. hostility. 
  Later, the fate of Cuban socialism was linked to the 
progress 
of the countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, 
which Cuba joined in 1972. 
  At the beginning of 1987, the process to correct errors and 
negative trends, spearheaded by the Communist Party of Cuba, had 
as it most novel element the attempt to articulate the return to 
what was homegrown, with greater democratization and 
institutional improvement of the political system. 
  Beginning in 1990, he noted, an emergency plan known as the 
special period was implemented throughout the country, which 
meant above all "guaranteeing national survival in an severely 
hostile international environment given the permanent U.S. 
aggressiveness against the Cuban socialist program." 
  Therefore, Cuba is facing, as are other Third World 
economies, the so-called "export challenge" under 
disadvantageous and contradictory conditions. 
  According to Dilla, the latter is seen at the international 
level in an abrupt end of what was for almost three decades its 
preferential markets and, at the same time, in the introduction 
"into a world market that is competitive and economically 
exclusive, politically conditioned by Washington's obsessive 
hostility." 
  Internally, he stresses, it presupposes a costly and gradual 
technological reconversion process and a vast reorganization of 
relations among economic factors like production, distribution, 
and consumption. 
  With regard to the latter, he believes that in order to 
maintain liquidity within manageable limits (the excess money 
supply is estimated at 10 billion pesos, which is the same 
amount in dollars in accordance with the official exchange 
rate), it will be necessary to disrupt traditional consumption 
policy by reducing demand. 
  A basic principle of consumption policy since the 1960's was 
the preservation of a rationed basic family basket at very low 
prices, which presupposed subsidies that between 1976 and 1981 
amounted to 2 billion pesos. 
  Furthermore, in spite of the virtues of such a projection, 
under current conditions its modification is a basic premise for 
economic takeoff, even if it means ethical-ideological 
discrepancies. 
  The Cuban economic-financial situation was widely discussed 
in late December by the parliament, which decided to meet again 
in a special session early this year to study the possibility of 
implementing measures aimed at solving the crisis and preserving 
the conquests of socialism.

  [Text] Havana, 7 Jan (PL) -- The Revolutionary Armed Forces 
(FAR) of Cuba is focusing on resource savings and economic 
efficiency, according to reports issued and opinions expressed 
by FAR command staff. 
  Our military chiefs must manage economic information. They 
must know the price of sweet potatoes (domestic tuber) as well 
as the price of a bullet, FAR Minister Army General Raul Castro 
said during a visit to military installations yesterday. 
  The local media's report on the visit highlighted the 
defense 
minister's interest in reinforcing the troops' combat capability 
and their participation in economic activities geared mainly 
toward increasing food production. 
  Gen. Raul Castro himself recently explained to members of 
the 
Communist Party of Cuba's Central Committee, of which he is 
second secretary, the efforts made by the FAR to increase 
training levels despite a major expense reduction. 
  On that occasion he detailed how the Cuban military had 
greatly increased its food supplies by producing its own food 
and how it had even rendered important services to the country's 
economy, primarily through a special corps called Youth Labor 
Army (EJT). 
  Although the traditional U.S. hostility against the Cuban 
revolution forces the FAR to use great discretion in its 
expenditures, last year the armed institution reduced its budget 
by 600 million pesos -- equivalent to dollars at the official 
exchange rate, according to official reports issued last week. 
  Cuba is going through an adverse economic situation 
following 
the collapse of socialism in the former Soviet Union and the 
East European countries as the island conducted 85 percent of 
its foreign trade under equal conditions with those areas. 
  Those nations, especially the former USSR, were the FAR's 
main suppliers of weapons, ammunition, and other articles. 
  Despite the situation, FAR sent thousands of its members to 
perform agriculture tasks in the fertile plains south of Havana 
last summer. Also, approximately 6,000 EJT soldiers have been 
permanently assigned to tend crops in that same region since 
last October.

  [Text] Havana, 12 Jan (PL) -- A top Communist Party of Cuba 
(PCC) official asserted today that, although difficulties will 
continue in 1994, the country will have greater chances of 
advancing in its attempts to resolve the adverse economic 
situation. 
  I see a very solid and strong future for the revolution, 
considering the support of the great majority of our people and 
the great deal of optimism that exists, to continue to confront 
difficulties, PCC Central Committee member Jorge Lezcano told 
PRENSA LATINA. 
  Lezcano, first secretary of the PCC in Havana, explained 
that 
although the same basic economic factors that created conditions 
in 1993 will continue this year, the country will have a few 
more advantages and opportunities. 
  According to Lezcano, we have the experience of having 
confronted and overcome a year as difficult as 1993, we know 
what to do to confront the problems that arise, and we have 
become better organized in facing the special period. I believe 
all of this will work in our favor, he underlined. 
  The Special Period in Times of Peace is the name given to 
the 
measures Cuba has had to adopt to confront the consequences 
prompted by the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe and the 
former Soviet Union -- nations with which Cuba sustained 85 
percent of its trade. 
  In addition to the abrupt loss of its main trading partners, 
the island has had to confront the hardening of the U.S. 
blockade, which has been in effect for more than 30 years. 
  Meanwhile, Lezcano said, there are other factors that will 
differentiate the situation between both 12-month periods, and 
he recalled that the prolonged electricity cuts and the 
paralysis of the factories in the capital city and the rest of 
the country had started in 1993. 
  We have started January 1994 with all factories operating, 
albeit with limitations, but nevertheless operating and with 
less stringent electricity cuts scheduled than in 1993, he noted. 
  According to Lezcano, this year should also yield the 
expected positive results, especially in terms of savings and 
the optimal use of resources because of the new system of state 
land cultivation called Basic Cooperative Production Units 
(UBPC). 
  The new system establishes that plots are given to the 
associates in usufruct for an indefinite amount of time. They 
also receive soft loans to acquire working equipment and are the 
owners of the crops they produce. It is estimated that those 
measures will propitiate a food production increase, he added. 
  The UBPC's started operating last October and currently 
exist 
in almost all the former state farms. 
  The party leader also pointed out that one of the positive 
factors expected for this year is an improved sugarcane harvest. 
Last year, the harvest yielded 4.2 million tons of sugar -- the 
lowest since 1963. 
  Lezcano pointed to favorable elements in the international 
sphere and, among others, he mentioned the considerable decrease 
in oil prices, which will help the country because it imports 
almost all the fuel it uses. 
  For these reasons, among others, he maintained, we assert 
that, although there will be difficulties and problems, the work 
perspectives for our people and for the revolution are somewhat 
better than they were in 1993. This leeway allows us more 
possibilities to get ahead.

  [Text] Havana, 19 Jan [date as received] (PL) -- Colombian 
and Cuban Health Ministers Juan Luis Londono and Julio Teja, 
respectively, signed several important cooperation agreements in 
Havana today. 
  The agreements covered matters relating to epidemiologic 
surveillance, human resource training, essential medicine, 
vaccinations, biotechnology products, and the drafting of a 
public health support system for Colombia. 
  President Fidel Castro attended the agreement-signing 
ceremony, which was held at the Convention Palace. Castro spoke 
with the visitors about the health situation in both countries 
and referred to Cuba's family doctor program and low infant 
mortality rate. 
  With regards to the latter, the Cuban leader reported Cuba's 
1993 infant mortality rate was 9.4 for every 1,000 live births. 
He said the possibility of going below 10 in a tropical country 
had always been questioned. 
  In a brief assessment of his visit to the island, which 
started on 2 January, Londono stated he had found a health 
system superior to existing systems throughout the rest of the 
continent. 
  After noting that primary attention in Cuba is not only 
effective but also efficient, the Colombian health minister 
emphasized the signing of an agreement with the Genetic 
Engineering and Biotechnology Center for the purchase of 2.5 
million Hepatitis-B vaccines. 
  Likewise, an agreement was reached with the Pedro Kouri 
Tropical Medicine Institute to draft a support program to 
control specific public health problems in Colombia.

<F P=106> [Report by Amelia Roque] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 4 Jan (PL) -- One of the Cuban Book 
Institute's [Instituto Cubano del Libro, ICL] main achievements 
during 1993 was the marketing of approximately 270 books in the 
domestic market and the printing of an additional 100 to be sold 
in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. 
  In an interview given to PRENSA LATINA, ICL President Pablo 
Pacheco has explained that during the current economic crisis, 
book publishing has continued despite limited paper and supplies 
available to the national printing press industry. 
  The ICL increased jointly the use of coeditions with the 
Universities of Guadalajara, Mexican National Autonomous, Valle, 
Cali, Colombia, and with Venezuelan firms such as Pomaire. 
  The following books resulted from this joint effort: Yellow 
Submarine [Submarino Amarillo] (an anthology of Cuban stories), 
A Group Advances Quietly [Un Grupo Avanza Silencioso] (a 
selection of young Cuban poets), and stories by narrator Onelio 
Jorge Cardoso. 
  During the past year, Cuban publishing houses distributed 
the 
following books on the island: The American Expression, by Jose 
Lezama Lima (Cuban literature); The Cat and the Mouse, by Gunter 
Grass (art and literature); The Religious System of the 
Afro-Cubans, by Romulo Lachatanere (social sciences), and 
scientific-technological publications. 
  Comparing the amount of books printed in 1993 to previous 
years-- 2,500 editions were printed in 1989--the ICL president 
said the crisis hindered the printing press, not intellectual 
activity. 
  This is confirmed, he said, by the numbers of international 
awards received by writers of the island. For example, Eliseo 
Diego received the "Juan Rulfo" Latin American and Caribbean 
Award; a poetry book by Jose Perez Olivares received the Spanish 
"Rafael Alberti" Award; Daniel Chavarria, an Uruguayan who 
resides in Havana, received the Mexican Planeta Novel Award, 
among others. 
  Pacheco also mentioned the New Pines Collection [Coleccion 
Pinos Nuevos]--which promotes 100 unpublished Cuban 
authors--sponsored by Argentine intellectuals, headed by Aurelio 
Narvaja, the Colihue Publishing Firm director, cultural promoter 
Monica Sorin, and several authors. 
  Approximately 600 original texts were received for this 
collection, the expert added. Pacheco also revealed that those 
books will be presented at the Sixth International Book Fair in 
Havana next February. 
  Pacheco believes last year's most important achievement was 
the implementation of a new financing system that will allow the 
institute's free convertible currency revenues to be used to 
print Cuban material for sales abroad. 
  Previously, the institute only had the government's support. 
The current self-financing program will allow the institute to 
have a publishing program that has possibilities for growth once 
Cuban books reenter the international market, Pacheco concluded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Comandante Marcos, Mexican Indios rebel </F>
leader, by Roger Gutierrez Diaz in San Cristobal, Mexico; date 
not given: "Comandante Marcos" --first paragraph is LA STAMPA 
introduction -- copyrighted by LA JORNADA] 
  [Text] San Cristobal -- I walked through the doorway of the 
town hall occupied by the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN] guerrillas, and asked for Comandante Marcos. After being 
let through by an Indio woman holding a rifle, I went up to the 
second floor. Everything had been destroyed. Only the 
chandeliers hanging from the ceiling were intact. 
  [Diaz] Your troops do not seem to be strong enough to march 
on Mexico City and overthrow President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari. Are you not being too optimistic? 
  [Marcos] Look, if you are worried that we may be marching on 
Mexico City, rest assured. We will wait for a little while 
longer. Anyway, speaking seriously, I can assure you that what 
you see here, in San Cristobal, is only a fraction of our 
troops, most of which nobody can identify since, in the 
countryside, they wear no uniform. There are more Zapatists in 
the Indio communities than you or the government can imagine. 
Therefore, we will not go to Mexico City with these forces 
alone, but also with all the others which are gradually building 
up. 
  [Diaz] Your weapons are much less powerful than the Army's. 
Is this not an insurmountable handicap? 
  [Marcos] Our weapons are the people and our knowledge of 
these mountains. 
  [Diaz] Where were you born? 
  [Marcos] I am Mexican, like all those who fight in the 
Zapatist army, but I am not from Chiapas. 
  [Diaz] Where did you train to become a guerrilla? 
  [Marcos] I have trained a lot, but that is all I am prepared 
to tell you. I am well aware of the difference between fighting 
in the countryside and in towns, in the plains or the mountains, 
in the jungle or the desert. 
  [Diaz] Where do you stand in relation to liberation 
theology? 
  [Marcos] We are fighting to liberate ourselves alone, 
without 
any help from theology. Among our people, there are Evangelists 
and Catholics, atheists, and witch-doctors alike. This story 
about witch-doctors is not a joke. I am speaking of the Chiapas 
witch-doctors. 
  [Diaz] Is the Zapatist army calling for new elections? 
  [Marcos] What is happening now, what they are doing to 
bolster the new presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, is 
only a masquerade. We all know very well that the votes count 
for nothing, and that the electoral law is a sham created by 
Salinas, who is a usurper and a traitor. We want real 
elections, in which all parties have a chance, not only the PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party]. 
  [Diaz] There are indications that the "coletos," as San 
Cristobal's inhabitants are nicknamed, are not all that happy 
about this incursion in their town. In the streets, everybody 
is repeating that violence leads nowhere. Does this type of 
response from the people not worry you? 
  [Marcos] Of course, I would like them to respond somewhat 
differently. But I would like to stress that those who are not 
Indios, the so-called "coletos" and "ladinos," are very racist. 
If one of them steps into a bus and a "Chamula" [Chamula 
Indian] is seated, they make him get up. If they see an Indio 
on the road, they step on the gas and barely miss him. If 
people who behave like this disapprove of the Zapatist army, you 
will understand that I am not in the least concerned. As far as 
violence not leading to any results is concerned, I could answer 
that it is precisely the institutional violence into which 
Salinas has plunged the country, as well as violence in the form 
of death from cholera, malaria and measles, violence in the form 
of hunger and deprivation, which has led us to opt for this 
extreme solution. We are not aiming to establish an autonomous 
government, we are only demanding a democratically elected 
government, and respect for all the indian tribes. Another 
thing that I would like to make clear is that I am not the 
Zapatists' leader. We do not have a head, but rather a 
committee.

  [Text] Another of the mandatory issues Foreign Minister 
Noemi Sanin must address while in Venezuela is the case of the 
helicopter in Arauca. The Colombian Prosecutor General's Office 
has enough evidence to press charges against 10 members of the 
Venezuelan National Guard for their part in the border 
incidents. She will not be able to achieve a thing if there is 
no cooperation from Venezuela. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office is investigating four 
specific crimes stemming from the helicopter incident involving 
10 members of the Venezuelan National Guard. The Prosecutor 
General's Office now believes the helicopter was not shot down 
and that the Venezuelan officers violated Colombian territory. 
Theft, property damage, and attempted kidnapping are the other 
crimes under investigation. Given the situation, however, 
Colombia will be unable to act against those responsible as long 
as the Venezuelan Government does not cooperate. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What will the 
Prosecutor General's Office do next? Are you going to order the 
arrest of those involved? 
  [Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff] Naturally, we will 
have to take measures to take the suspects into custody as well 
as press charges, determine which charges to press, and present 
our cases before the judge. 
  [Reporter] Can these steps be taken by the Colombian 
Prosecutor's Office or will it have to be done by the Venezuelan 
Prosecutor General's Office? 
  [De Greiff] It will have to be done by the Colombian 
prosecutor because the events took place in Colombia. Where we 
do need Venezuela's cooperation -- and we think we will get it 
-- is in identifying the suspects. 
  [Reporter] Would these suspects be brought to Colombia? 
  [De Greiff] Naturally. Again, this would be done with the 
Venezuelan Government's cooperation. [end recording] 
  The issue is now in the hands of Minister Noemi Sanin and 
her 
protest action today in Venezuela, which is directed at getting 
the Venezuelan Government to second Colombia's legal actions and 
seeing these crimes do not go unpunished.

<F P=106> [Report by Liliana Gutierrez; from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Colombian Government, through Foreign Minister 
Noemi Sanin Posada de Rubio, has filed a formal protest with the 
Venezuelan Government for the violation of its sovereignty by a 
Venezuelan National Guard helicopter in the area of Arauca. 
This is an excerpt of the formal protest note: 
  It textually reads: According to the results of the 
preliminary investigations conducted by the appropriate 
organizations, it has been established that once the aircraft 
illegally entered Colombian territory, its crew began stopping 
and detaining Colombian nationals, mistreating them, and taking 
away their belongings. This is a violation of international and 
internal norms protecting the sovereignty and integrity of 
states and private property. After the incidents mentioned 
above, the Colombian nationals who were being held were forced 
to board the helicopter that later crashed, injuring some of 
them. 
  The formal protest note adds: The Colombian Government, in 
condemning these incidents, is attentively awaiting the results 
of the investigation. It hopes the results will enable 
authorities to determine who was responsible, as well as to 
impose severe punishment on those responsible in order to avoid 
situations in the future that could tarnish the existing 
atmosphere of understanding between our peoples and governments. 
  Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin will turn over to the 
Venezuelan 
Government the protest on the violation of Colombian airspace 
and territory following the incident with the Venezuelan 
National Guard helicopter, which crashed in the Puerto Rico area 
in Arauca Department. The foreign minister asked authorities to 
investigate and punish those found responsible for abuses 
committed against peasants in the region. 
  Even though the diplomatic language was one of mutual praise 
and the incident was played down, Colombia gave the Venezuelan 
authorities the evidence gathered by the Prosecutor General's 
Office and the Defense Ministry. 
  Meanwhile, Venezuelan Defense Minister Radames Munoz said 
the 
incident was due to mechanical problems with the helicopter and 
added that Colombian sovereignty was not violated and peasants 
were not mistreated. 
  Finally, there was a border commission meeting in Caracas. 
Members reviewed the report drafted by Deputy Pompeyo Marquez in 
which it was revealed that along the 2,000-km border there are 
more than 70 areas where conflicts have occurred.

  [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 13 Jan, CANA -- The main 
opposition People's National Congress (PNC) has criticised the 
government's acceptance of funds from foreign investors to 
underwrite a presidential tour of Asia. 
  "These financiers have substantal investment in Guyana and 
are known to be negotiating further investment with the 
government," the party said. It accused the government of 
"compromising their ability to best serve the interests of the 
country." 
  The opposition Working People's Alliance (WPA) and the 
Guyanese Organisation of Indigenous Peoples (GOIP) earlier said 
it was inappropriate that South Korean and Malaysian investors 
in the Barama Company Limited should underwrite part of the cost 
of President Cheddi Jagan's near month-long tour of China, 
Malaysia, Singapore and India which ended January 1. 
  At a press conference last Friday, Jagan admitted the 
financing received through Barama to augment limited public 
funds, but said he was unable to say at the time the amount of 
the funds from the Barama investors. 
  Barama officials here have referred queries about the extent 
of the financing to the government. 
  Barama, a manufacturer of plywood for export, has been 
touched by controversy over the level of concessions it received 
from the former Desmond Hoyte administration, and the impact of 
its forestry operations on the environment and on hinterland 
Amerindian communities here. 
  The Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) also commented, 
indirectly, on the matter in a statement Tuesday expressing 
concern that linkages with the newly-industrialised Asian 
economies opened Guyana to an "aggressive form of exploitation." 
  "It requires no great leap to imagine several powerful Asian 
conglomerates ensuring domestic legislation protects their 
interests when one, Barama Company Ltd, is so profoundly 
influencing foreign policy," the GHRA statement said. 
  Former Prime Minister Hamilton Green, at a press conference 
Wednesday, described the financing of the presidential tour as 
"unorthodox and inappropriate funding by a private group."

  [Text] President-elect Rafael Caldera has insisted he will 
do everything possible to fulfill his electoral promise of 
suspending the controversial value-added tax [VAT]. 
  Caldera made this statement during a ceremony in his honor 
given by members of the Venezuelan Academy of Language. The 
ceremony was also attended by Venezuelan President Ramon J. 
Velasquez and other representatives from the Executive and 
Judicial Branches. Rafael Caldera pointed out that as soon he 
starts his administration, he will present several proposals to 
the new parliament in an effort to make the VAT more just. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] I hope Congress will accept this. 
I have heard that some groups seem to be interested in learning 
more about my proposal and in accepting it in principle. I hope 
this will be the case. [end recording] 
  When consulted about the possibility of dismissing charges 
against the individuals involved in the massacre at El Amparo, 
the president-elect emphasized that the current government 
should be very careful in this respect.

  [Text] For President Ramon J. Velasquez, as well as for 
President-elect Rafael Caldera, the imposition of price controls 
on family basket products comes in response to a public plea. 
The fixing of prices on 10 family basket products via price 
controls does not imply, in President Ramon J. Velasquez's 
opinion, that a step backward will be taken in the process of 
modernizing our economy. This measure is an attempt to halt 
speculation. 
  Meanwhile, on this same subject, President-elect Rafael 
Caldera said the measure should be temporary, and he explained 
that in his government taxes will have to be paid. 
Nevertheless, the idea is to get those who have more to pay 
more and not for those who have less to pay more. 
  Asdrubal Batista, economic adviser to Caldera, also 
commented 
on the VAT and price control issues. For Batista, the VAT is 
part of a tax system that unfortunately lacks fairness, and, 
therefore, in his opinion, the whole tax system should be 
totally reformed. 
  Here is what President Velasquez said: 
  [Begin recording] [Velasquez] Speculation has become 
widespread and therefore it is the government's duty, as 
indicated by law, to take steps necessary to protect the 
consumers -- in other words, the majority of the people. In the 
coming months, a number of reforms will have to be passed by 
parliament. It is not that we will be taking a step backward in 
the economy's modernization process. No, not at all -- no one 
is thinking such a thing. Venezuela cannot step backward, 
because those conditions of fiscal abundance in which everything 
was subsidized and everything was protected was a situation of 
false harmony that no longer exists. Unfortunately, this 
situation no longer exists. [video cuts to interview with 
President-elect Rafael Caldera] 
  [Caldera] We want those who can pay more to pay more, while 
not placing a heavy burden on those who have less and, in turn, 
can pay less. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you think that this can be done? 
  [Caldera] There is apparently willingness to implement the 
measures necessary to save the fiscal deficit and to orient the 
nation's economy. This economy should not be inflationary in 
order to allow the necessary stability to develop. [video cuts 
to interview with Caldera adviser Asdrubal Batista] 
  [Batista] It is regretful that currently those who have less 
are paying more proportionately than those who have more. This 
is what economists call a (?regressive tax) -- that is, an 
implicit imbalance in the direct tax collection system. This 
situation must be corrected, otherwise problems will occur over 
and over again. In short, accounts cannot be paid, expenses 
cannot be met, public services deteriorate completely, and the 
people feel general dissatisfaction because the state is not 
meeting its commitments. There is a law of dimension, and I 
think it is as follows: The state must allocate funds for its 
expenditures, and at the same time these disbursements must be 
permanently and cleanly financed through taxes paid by the 
community. [end recording] 
  All concurred that it is the next parliament that must 
assess 
the extent of the changes the nation has experienced and take 
appropriate action.

  [Text] Today, Caracas Mayor Aristobulo Isturiz presented a 
request for annulment of the VAT law to the political and 
administrative division of the Supreme Court of Justice because 
he feels it is unconstitutional. He will also present a writ of 
amparo calling for the suspendion of the VAT collection in his 
jurisdiction while the Supreme Court issues a ruling. 
  According to Mayor Isturiz, the law is unconstitutional 
because tax issues are the exclusive responsibility of the 
national Congress and therefore its approval cannot be delegated 
to others. In addition, modifications to the tax system should

  [Text] Congressman Reinaldo Cervini has pointed out that 
the VAT is a regressive and unconstitutional measure that must 
be reformed. 
  [Begin Cervini recording] Measures, such as price controls, 
just seek to please the people for the time being. If there was 
really a serious interest in controlling prices, the correct 
thing to do would have been to regulate bank interests as well 
as the costs of electricity, telephones, and transportation. In 
addition, measures should have been taken to control the prices 
businessmen pay for Central Bank bonds, and this would then lead 
to a just control of prices. 
  What is being done now will bring negative consequences for 
the national producers. The measure is strictly to please the 
people, but it is not being handled properly. [end recording]

  [Text] Barcelona, Venezuela, 13 Jan (AFP) -- Reporters have 
confirmed that two persons were killed and many were arrested 
during violent disturbances on Thursday following a massive 
protest against the increase in transportation rates in 
Barcelona, 200 km east of Caracas. 
  This is the first wave of violence to take place this year 
in 
Venezuela, where a new tax has increased consumer products by 10 
percent. 
  According to witnesses, the disturbances began when the 
police fired shots and used tear gas against a "peaceful" 
demonstration of residents who had blocked traffic on an 
important avenue. The people were protesting the hike in public 
transportation rates in effect since late December. The reports 
add that two persons were wounded -- one by bullets -- during 
the clash. A grocery truck on the outskirts of Barcelona was 
looted and there were attempts to loot some stores in the 
downtown area, but the police stopped them. 
  Although it was a people's protest, University of Oriente 
students expressed solidarity with the protest and burned a city 
bus. 
  At 1900 (2300 GMT) there still were serious traffic jams 
throughout the city.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Ramon Diaz] </F>
  [Text] The border problems of the past few days, of which 
one of the nations' four military bodies has directly suffered 
the consequences, have forced the National Guard [GN] High 
Command, led by General Commander Pedro Jose Romero Farias, to 
declare a state of emergency. At the same time, he alerted his 
troops and ordered them to mobilize toward the different 
security areas bordering Colombian territory. 
  The GN's decision is due to the recent increase of border 
problems, and according to the GN high command, there is no 
quick solution in sight. Apparently, Colombian authorities are 
not willing to cooperate in finding solutions to the problem. On 
the contrary, they have accused the GN of raiding their 
territory, thereby violating, according to their story, their 
territorial integrity. What occurred three days ago is the best 
example. On Friday, at approximately 1200, a GN commission was 
implementing an intensified border patrol program in the 
southwest region when their aircraft, a Bell Ranger 212 
helicopter with registration No. GN-8008, was downed by a group 
of Colombian rebels. Nevertheless, the Colombian authorities 
accused the GN of violating their airspace. 
  According to the Venezuelan aircraft pilots' story, GN 
Commander Manuel Bompart Pinango and GN Major Jesus Lozano 
Guanipa, accompanied by six soldiers -- one of whom was wounded, 
2d Corporal Yasmin Jaimes Canas -- were patrolling the security 
strip. Suddenly, Colombian guerrillas moving about in Venezuelan 
territory attacked the unit. The missiles hit the tail rotor 
forcing the aircraft to crash to the ground, thereby destroying 
the equipment. Fortunately, no human lives were lost. The 
rebels' attack took place exactly 500 meters from Hato El 
Tormento and approximately 10 km from the border checkpoint El 
Cututi on the banks of the Arauca River. 
  Given this case as well as others on other occasions, the GN 
high commanders believe the border problem with Colombia is 
becoming more and more intolerable. To begin with, the region is 
not secure. There is no way to prompt Colombian authorities to 
plan and carry out actions with Venezuela to guarantee 
territorial integrity on this side of the border. Therefore, 
guerrillas, kidnappers, and drug traffickers are having a heyday 
in this region, specifically in the Paez District, the Apure 
State, and in the autonomous municipalities of Catatumbo and 
Colon in Zulia State. 
  Meanwhile, according to authorities, the GN has been the 
target of a campaign to discredit them in recent months. This 
campaign has been stepped up recently not only by rebels who 
operate in the security areas, but also by Colombian 
authorities, who do not hesitate to accuse GN members of 
attacking Colombia's territorial integrity. 
  Given this serious situation in which a satisfactory 
solution 
has not been reached with the Colombia authorities, the GN high 
commanders, with prior authorization from their superiors, 
issued a general alert order to all commands in border security 
areas. Simultaneously, as a support operation, troops have been 
deployed in the region bordering Colombia. 
  Division General Pedro Jose Romero Farias, GN general 
commander, confirmed that all the commanders on the border have, 
in effect, been issued a "general alert" order. In addition, 
military personnel have been deployed to the region to control 
attacks by Colombian rebels. 
  Romero Farias said: "We will combat these irregular actions 
without any hesitation. We will also defend, however, the GN's 
honor, considering the GN has been the target of a campaign to 
discredit it by bandits who now feel cornered as a result of the 
operations carried out by the GN." 
  Meanwhile, it was learned at Fort Tiuna that Army commands 
have stepped up their action in the Joint Task Force mission. 
These are contingents that jointly execute military operations 
to guarantee Venezuela's territorial integrity. Within this 
framework, their task is to combat and wipe out the presence of 
Colombian rebels and combat other crimes, among which are drug 
trafficking, contraband, and common crimes that constantly 
disrupt the peace and prevent normal socioeconomic development 
in the region. 
  The Army's idea with the so-called Joint Task Force is to 
create an atmosphere of security for the people in the area and 
to combat guerrilla activity -- that is, to minimize the 
Colombian guerrillas' presence as well as their activities, 
reduce the number of kidnappings, increase the Armed Forces' 
prestige in the region, and preserve sovereignty and territorial 
integrity. 
  Given these incidents on the border, Army Div. Gen. Alberto 
Emerich Esqueda Torres, permanent secretary of the National 
Security and Defense Council, announced yesterday the new border 
security arrangements will definitely be made known this week. 
It is very possible, he added, that President Ramon J. Velasquez 
will disclose the decree's details. It is also possible the 
president will speak to the governors and cattle ranchers of 
those regions in the province that borders other nations. After 
these talks, President Velasquez will make the final decision on 
whether or not to issue a decree regarding border security areas. 
  Precisely because of the course of events on the nation's 
borders, a group of experts from the Institute of Higher Studies 
on National Defense, directed by Vice Admiral Mario Ivan Carratu 
Molina, traveled to the western region -- specifically to the 
Falcon, Zulia, Tachira, and Apure States. Pompeyo Marquez and 
Leandro Area from the Negotiating Commission on Border Matters 
with Colombia; Jose Rodriguez Iturbe, president of Congress' 
Foreign Policy Commission; and other personalities are also 
participating in this mission. 
  According to Carratu Molina, the mission's goal in these 
areas is to verify important political, economic, social, and 
military aspects within the security and defense framework. 
Carratu Molina said: "At each of the sites to be visited, we 
will meet with the state governors, garrison commanders, and 
military unit and development corporation commanders of each 
region. 
  In Zulia State particularly, Army Brigade Gen. Romer Cumare 
Roa, commander of the Army's 1st Infantry Division, and his 
staff will discuss the military situation on the state's border 
area with the mission. This situation is very critical because 
of constant attacks by Colombian criminals. 
  The Army's 2d Infantry Division brigadier general and GN 
Brig. Gen. German Valera Araque, chief of the GN's 1st Regional 
Command in Tachira State, were the ones who reported what was 
happening in the region. 
  The mission arrived at Guasdualito (Apure) and La Fria 
(Tachira) yesterday, where they toured the border posts and 
visited the corresponding military units.

  [Text] Venezuela and Colombia this morning signed a 
bilateral treaty on the repatriation of prison inmates. The 
agreement, proposed by Venezuela, will allow approximately 1,500 
Colombian inmates to return to their country and finish serving 
there the sentences ordered by Venezuelan courts. 
  Eighteen months after the agreement to allow prisoners to go 
to Colombia was presented, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Fernando 
Ochoa Antich and Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio 
today signed the final document. 
  The agreement calls for the transfer of prisoners, provided 
they have been sentenced by the courts. Of the 2,800 Colombian 
prisoners in Venezuelan jails, only 1,500 qualify under the 
agreement. Nonetheless, the agreement is voluntary, which means 
that both Venezuelans and Colombians will be able to choose if 
they want to be repatriated or not to their country of origin.

  [Excerpts] The leaders of the Manuel Rodriguez Movement 
(MMR) yesterday did not rule out the possibility of violent 
actions of various degrees during the Eduardo Frei government, 
warning that this will depend on the violence used by the system. 
  In its first statement on the next administration, the MMR 
said that it will demand that Frei "pay the immense social debt 
contracted by the government of Patricio Aylwin." 
  Cesar Quiroz, deputy coordinator of the MMR National Board, 
who in June 1991 abandoned the armed struggle to join politics, 
said that the level of violence would depend on the situation in 
the country and on the people's acceptance of it. 
  About its links with the Autonomous Manuel Rodriguez Front 
(FMR-A), which has remained underground, undertaking subversive 
actions, the MMR said that it had no plans for joint actions, 
though adding that it respects them in their capacity as former 
companions in the armed struggle. [passage omitted] 
  Quiroz, who said that the current state of law is "highly 
repressive," made these remarks during a press conference that 
he and MMR National Board member Marco Riquelme hosted yesterday 
at the MIDA [Allendist Leftist Democratic Movement] headquarters. 
  The members of the political group said they do not expect 
any change for the future, adding that the police state would 
become more intense during this period. 
  They also emphasized that during the "new times" Socialists 
will be in charge of repression, thus alluding to the 
designation of the Socialist German Correa to the Interior 
Ministry. 
  The leaders read a statement to the press saying that the 
Aylwin government did not resolve the problem of political 
prisoners or of human rights. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Vice Admiral Jorge Patricio Arancibia, chief of 
the National Defense Staff, yesterday reiterated that the 
Chilean Armed Forces "are totally subordinated to the 
government, and should they undertake any action they will do it 
with top professionalism." 
  During a Latin American seminar on military spending being 
held in Santiago, Arancibia made an overall analysis of the 
decisionmaking process and changes within this context. He 
emphasized that this type of meeting permitted one to see "the 
progress achieved in technical and academic relations between 
civilians and the military." 
  During the conference's first day, which was designed by the 
National Academy of Political and Strategic Studies [Academia 
Nacional de Estudios Politicos y Estrategicos] (ANEPE), and by 
the Latin American School of Social Sciences (Flacso), the 
agenda included defense policies, new security concepts, the 
economic balance, and military spending in developed countries.

  [Excerpt] Mining Minister Alejandro Hales yesterday 
endorsed the suggestion of Juan Villarzu, the executive 
president-designate of Codelco [Copper Corporation], that the 
Armed Forces should be funded directly from the National 
Treasury and not from 10 percent of net sales of copper. 
  After learning that different sectors of the country support 
Villarzu's views, Hales stated that it would be advisable to 
include appropriations for the Armed Forces in the National 
Budget. "Nobody is seeking to deprive the Armed Forces of its 
financing, rather that it should come from a more legitimate 
source," he added. 
  The mining minister explained that the allotments derived 
from the Reserved Law on Copper (No. 13196) -- which came into 
effect during the military regime -- totalled $313 million in 
1989, $287 million in 1990, $223 million in 1991, $204 million 
in 1992, and $197 million in 1993. He noted that as last year's 
allotment was lower than the $180 million minimum contemplated 
in the law plus the Consumer Price Index readjustment, the total 
for 1993 will be $210 million. "The National Treasury will have 
to supplement the minimum payment with $30 million. This 
financial obligation will not be defrayed by Codelco but by the 
National Treasury," he said. [passage omitted]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 13 
January. 
  According to the National Statistics Institute, INE, the 
accumulated inflation rate during 1993 was 12.2 percent, the 
lowest in the past 12 years. The Consumer Price Index, IPC, in 
December 1993 was 0.2 percent. The unemployment rate, according 
to the INE, during the last quarter of 1993 was 4.4 percent. 
This means 225,000 workers are unemployed. (Santiago Television 
Nacional de Chile Imagen Internacional in Spanish 0000 GMT 6 Jan 
94) 
  Foreign investment in the first 11 months of 1993 totalled 
$2.3 billion, an increase of 91.7 percent compared with the same 
period in 1992. Mining registered the highest investment with 
47.1 percent, industry with 29.4 percent, services with 16.8 
percent, transportation with 2.7 percent, and forestry with 1.5 
percent. The major investors are the United States with 36.8 
percent, Canada with 11.5 percent, Great Britain with 8.5 
percent, Spain with 7.2 percent, Australia with 5.6 percent, and 
Japan with 4.3 percent. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 23 Dec 
93 p B1) 
  On 22 December 1993, the National Fisheries Service reported 
that fishing exports totalled 1.038 million metric tons from 
January to October 1993, a 16.4 percent drop compared with the 
same period in 1992. This yielded a $974 million profit, a 14.7 
percent drop. (Santiago EL MERCURIO in Spanish 23 Dec 93 p B10) 
  Exports of textiles and clothing totalled $144 million in 
1993, an increase ov 26.3 percent compared with the previous 
year's $114 million. (Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 23 Dec 93 p 
22) 
  The Chilean trade balance registered a $826 million deficit 
in the January-November 1993 period; in the same period in 1992 
it registered a $716.5 million surplus. The November trade 
balance registered the highest deficit with $174 million because 
of a substantial decline in the copper price. (Santiago EL 
MERCURIO in Spanish 24 Dec 93 pp A1, A20) 
  Chilean Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma and Japanese 
Ambassador Eto Yukinisa exchanged notes in which Japan donates 
$14 million in nonreimbursable cooperation to build the most 
modern fish market in Chile. It will be built in Lo Espejo 
District; its design is based on the most modern Japanese 
experience and technology. It will work as a center to promote 
the consumption of sea products and will be ready by 1995. Japan 
will construct the market, while Chile will provide the site and 
pay administrative and supervision costs. (Santiago Radio 
Cooperativa Network in Spanish 1000 GMT 13 Jan 94)

  [Text] The Ecuadoran Government announced today that its 
policy on paying the debt with the international financial 
institutions remains unchanged and that the government will not 
make any payments whatsoever to international commercial banks 
  Finance Minister Cesar Robalino said: We are making payments 
to the multilateral financial organizations on the principal and 
interest and will continue to do so with or without the crisis. 
He added: We have also maintained a policy toward the 
international commercial banks, which I have repeated over 100 
times, and that policy remains the same; it has not changed. 
  Robalino said that negotiations with the commercial banks 
are 
still under way and that no agreement has yet been reached with 
the creditors grouped in the Paris Club. He said the government 
will soon present a refinancing plan to the Paris Club, but he 
did not outline what that plan would be. 
  Robalino said that problems emerge whenever there is a 
plunge 
in the prices of basic products such as oil, which is so 
important to Ecuador's economy. But, he added, the negotiation 
process with the banks must continue. He said that it is not 
easy to reach an agreement with the banks, but the country has 
been working on the refinancing process for many years and will 
continue to do so. "We hope to reach an agreement and the date 
on which that happens is important because it is a complex 
process," Robalino said. 
  The finance minister admitted that the commercial banks are 
asking Ecuador to resume interest payments so that an agreement 
can be reached but not because they want to hold serious 
discussions. [sentence as heard]

  [Text] Quito, 12 Jan (DPA) -- Amid a deafening silence, 
Ecuadoran police were today feverishly searching for the Cuban 
Embassy's business attache in Quito, who disappeared 
mysteriously on Sunday apparently with the intention of asking 
for political asylum. 
  Official Arturo Yero might be being held hostage at the 
Cuban 
diplomatic offices, according to the organization of Cuban 
exiles, Cuban Democratic Solidarity, which did not rule out the 
possibility that Yero could have found "safe haven." 
  Sources in the Foreign Ministry in Quito unofficially 
confirmed the disappearance of Yero and his wife but denied an 
asylum request had been filed. 
  Some 10 Cuban diplomats and journalists have deserted in 
Ecuador in the past few years, including intelligence officers. 
  According to Jesus Cruza-Flor, president of Cuban Democratic 
Solidarity, Yero is actually "a captain of Castro's intelligence 
forces" who reportedly received an order to return immediately 
to Havana, "which he refused." Cruza-Flor said the 
disappearance of the official, which is the second such case at 
the Cuban Embassy in Quito, "confirms that Fidel Castro's regime 
is inevitably reaching its end because of the overall discontent 
of the people, who flee Cuba as soon as they find an 
opportunity, leaving everything behind and risking it all."

  [Text] Madrid, 13 Jan (AFP) -- The newspaper EL MUNDO 
reported today that Cuban leader Fidel Castro has categorically 
rejected Spain's political-economic reform proposal, arguing 
that it seeks to impose pluralism and democracy on Cuba. 
According to EL MUNDO and as can be deduced from the report 
presented in the summer of 1993 to Castro by Carlos Solchaga, 
former Spanish economy minister, the Spanish Government advised 
Castro to implement a rapid transition to capitalism. According 
to the newspaper, Castro was also especially upset because 
Solchaga does not make the slightest mention of the U.S. 
blockade, blaming the Cuban system alone for the serious crisis 
affecting the island. 
  Carlos Solchaga's secret report recommends that Castro 
implement immediate reform in three areas: privatization of all 
commercial sectors and industries; reduction of state 
intervention to a minimum by introducing a market economy with a 
Western-style fiscal system; and allowing the free economic 
initiative of Cuban and foreign individuals and companies. 
  EL MUNDO goes on to say that Solchaga contradicts one of the 
Castro's main theories, according to which Cuba can overcome the 
crisis through the development of two profitable and 
well-organized economic activities -- tourism and sugar sales. 
EL MUNDO notes, citing Solchaga's report, that "the stagnation 
of the remaining productive sectors would prevent the chosen 
sectors from developing." 
  In its study of the Cuban ecomony, the Solchaga report says 
that the Castro government has been unable to generate wealth 
because of political factors. In his research, Solchaga refers 
to the situation of the Cuban economy as disastrous, emphasizing 
that "galloping inflation" and "huge budget deficits" have 
paralyzed the country. 
  According to EL MUNDO, Fidel Castro is aware that the 
economic changes proposed by the Spanish Government and the IMF 
would lead to a transition to democracy and pluralism. EL MUNDO 
notes that time and again Castro has explained that he will 
never give up the Communist Party's monopoly on power. Instead, 
he insists that "Cuba must learn from China and Vietnam." 
According to Castro, Cuba's future lies in "a democratic 
dictatorship like the ones in China and Vietnam, which have not 
abandoned the Marxist-Leninist doctrine." 
  The document submitted by Spain has broken the usual 
unanimity within the Cuban system. According to EL MUNDO, 
Carlos Lage -- in charge of the Communist Party's financial 
affairs and third in command -- considers that the Spanish 
recommendation for transition is a valid option

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Eduardo Dimas] </F>
  [Text] Every period in history has its own signs that 
differentiate it from former periods, and it seems to me that 
the signs of this particular period that has befallen us are 
already more than perceptible. After having won World War III 
without firing a shot, the United States and its allies, the 
winners, are hastening to collect the booty, especially the 
political booty. They are leaving the economic loot for later. 
  The problem for them at present is to keep the process 
taking place in the countries of the former socialist bloc -- 
that is, the transition to capitalism -- from backsliding; to 
channel relations with these countries along particular lines; 
and to diminish these countries' defensive capabilities, 
especially nuclear, as much as possible. 
  One of the NATO agreements reached at the recent summit in 
Brussels was to create a so-called Partnership for Peace -- 
proposed by the United States -- to receive the former members 
of the Warsaw Pact interested in strengthening ties to NATO, 
establish military cooperation, and participate in peace-keeping 
missions -- preventive interventions, to call them by their true 
name. But without a timetable for new members to join NATO, it 
is a formula for commitment that commits to nothing. 
  Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic received the news 
with satisfaction. Russia, to which the Partnership for Peace 
could also extend, reacted with caution because it does not know 
to what extent such an association is in its national interests. 
  The Russian Government's caution is understandable when we 
bear in mind Lithuania's request also to join NATO, and the 
not-to-be- dismissed possibility that an anti-Russian bloc could 
be formed in central Europe and the Baltic republics in the 
future. 
  With the creation of the Partnership for Peace, the United 
States and its allies subordinate the former socialist countries 
in military matters without offering them anything. That is, 
they place them in a kind of transitional period with no set 
limit, a period during which they are guaranteed consultations 
and cooperation but not security. On the other hand, that 
intermediate position is an invitation to comply with whatever 
orders they are given, so as to win entry into NATO. 
  Another sign of the times is the policy designed to disarm 
the former enemies. The entire nuclear arsenal of the former 
USSR is concentrated in four former Soviet republics: Russia, 
Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The objective of the United 
States and its allies is that Russia alone maintain a limited 
nuclear capability. They have promised the others economic and 
technical aid if they agree to destroy their arsenals. In a 
statement on 11 January in Brussels, U.S. President Bill Clinton 
announced that his country, Russia, and Ukraine would be signing 
an agreement under which Ukraine relinquishes its nuclear 
arsenal of 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles and (?1,500) 
nuclear warheads. Indeed, Clinton visited Kiev yesterday before 
going to Moscow for three days of meetings with Boris Yeltsin. 
Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is invited to participate. 
The agreement is to be signed tomorrow [14 January]. 
  As will be recalled, the Ukrainian Parliament conditioned 
ratification of the strategic nuclear arms reduction treaty, 
known by its U.S. acronym "START I," to the attainment of 
certain guarantees of security and economic compensations. 
  If what has been agreed on is accomplished, Ukraine would 
cease to be a nuclear power, which the western nuclear powers -- 
the United States, France, and Great Britain -- would like very 
much. These nations seek disarmament for everyone but themselves. 
  I cannot fail to recall the second half of the decade of the 
forties, the post-war period, when the United States had a 
monopoly on nuclear weapons and blackmailed the whole world with 
it. Will the same thing happen again? I don't doubt it. The 
United States will do so if it furthers its hegemonic interests. 
  This 13th NATO summit was a big success for the great 
powers, 
especially for the United States. Simply put, the world moved in 
a single direction and they are now reaping the fruits. This is 
a sign of the current period. I wonder: for how long?

  [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jan (EFE) -- In an interview 
published today in the newspaper EL SOL DE MEXICO, Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina stated that Cuba faces the challenge of 
surviving and adapting to new times without renouncing its 
revolutionary goals. Cuba has carried out "a social project for 
more than 30 years. It has overcome imbalanced trade situations 
and all those misconceptions about one's worth," Robaina stated. 
  Over the past years, according to the foreign minister, the 
Cuban Government has made important reforms, above all in 
economic aspects. Such reforms are not contrary to the 
revolution, because the word itself signifies change and "this 
country has been changing and revolutionizing since I learned 
how to reason." 
  Robaina told the Mexican newspaper that over the past months 
"we saw the need to decriminalize the dollar and we did so. In 
agriculture we decided to turn over the state lands to the 
people so that they could make them productive." He added that 
in the future they might make other decisions "which cannot even 
be conceived now, because life dictates necessities and one must 
have a fresh and agile mind to adapt to new circumstances, no 
matter how hard it may seem." 
  The Cuban foreign minister said that "the same generation 
that staged the Moncada attack has headed the attack on the new 
times, which demonstrates its revolutionary capability, its 
constant renewal, and the profound, enriched, and expert 
thinking of a group that is capable of directing changes without 
losing the essence." 
  Robaina reiterated that Cuba is not willing to lose any of 
its achievements. He stressed that "our independence, our 
sovereignty, and our capability to speak with our own voice 
cannot be modified." Personally, he said, he would like to be 
able to emerge from the difficulties soon, "so that reason will 
prevail once and for all and the United States will lift the 
economic, commercial, and financial blockade to which we have 
been subjected." 
  The foreign minister explained his wish to request that "the 
pressures be lifted, so that we can rejoin a more fair and 
equitable world economy, so that our people can again enjoy the 
standard of living which it had before the special period, and 
so that it can achieve much more."

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in 
Luanda today on a two-day official visit during which he will 
discuss with Angolan authorities the future relations between 
the two countries. During his stay in Angola, Robaina will be 
received by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. He also 
will meet with Prime Minister Marcolino Moco and the president 
of the parliament, Franca Van Dunem. Also on the agenda is a 
meeting with the Cuban community in Angola, which numbers some 
300 people. 
  Angolan Foreign Minister Venancio da Moura said in Luanda 
today that it is a privilege for his country to have, as its 
first visitor in 1994, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. 
Upon beginning the official talks between the two leaders today, 
da Moura stressed that Robaina's presence comes at a moment 
particularly difficult for the Angolan people because of the war 
led by the opposition group UNITA. Speaking of relations with 
Cuba, the Angolan foreign minister said that despite these 
difficulties, his country intends to work to strengthen the ties 
of cooperation that Angola has historically had with Cuba. 
  For his part, Robaina said that his visit to Angola is part 
of a diplomatic offensive in a changing world in which the Cuban 
authorities are searching for the appropriate milieu for Cuba.

  [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro met yesterday with 
Nova Scotian Prime Minister John Savage and the delegation 
accompanying him. In a news conference today, the Canadian 
political figure talked about this fruitful exchange. Journalist 
Elia Sardina has details: 
  [Begin recording] [Translator, speaking Spanish] Last night, 
we all met with the president at Government Palace. We had a 
reception and meeting that lasted three and a half hours. We 
talked about everything -- from trade, trade, trade, to the 
environment, to the role of the government in international 
development. We analyzed many things at that meeting. 
  [Savage, in English] And we had some far-ranging discussions 
on a variety of issues. It was a wonderful evening. 
  [Translator] But then we had discussions on an enormous 
variety of topics. It was a marvelous evening, greatly 
appreciated by our entire delegation. 
  [Savage, in English] This is the first visit by a Nova 
Scotian prime minister for 17...[rephrases] any Canadian prime 
minister for 17 years, I understand. 
  [Translator] I understand this is the first visit by the 
prime minister of any Canadian province in 17 years. 
  [Savage, in English] And I must say that it was, from our 
point of view and from the view of our business people, it was 
very worthwhile. 
  [Translator] And I can assure you that, from my point of 
view 
and from the point of view of my entire delegation, it was a 
visit that was clearly worthwhile. [end recording] 
  Nova Scotian Prime Minister John Savage termed very 
successful the intensive exchanges and talks between the 
delegation and its Cuban counterparts. 
  Regarding the results obtained, he said agreements having to 
do with the fishing industry have been signed and there will be 
tourist industry exchanges with the idea of forming joint 
Canadian-Cuban enterprises [empresas mixtas] for the 
construction of hotels. There is also a project to set up a 
detergent and soap factory, investments in the timber and coal 
industries, and the marketing of motor vehicles. These first 
agreements involve an investment of approximately $2 million. 
Savage is to meet this afternoon with Acting Foreign Minister 
Nicolas Rodriguez.

  [Text] Nova Scotian Prime Minister John Savage has ended 
his business trip to Cuba following last night's meeting with 
Commander in Chief Fidel Castro. Savage and Castro talked about 
trade, ecology, and international development. Savage, who was 
accompanied to the meeting by a large number of businessmen 
representing 17 Nova Scotian companies, said that it was a 
beautiful evening and our delegation enjoyed it. During their 
stay in Cuba, which the prime minister described as very 
successful, several trade agreements were reached and plans for 
Canadian funded mixed enterprises in the fields of industry, 
agriculture, tourism, and services were made. The trip was 
advantageous, profitable, and worthwhile, John Savage said. 
Savage was elected prime minister of Nova Scotia in May. He 
ran on the Liberal Party ticket. 
  John Savage, a doctor and the first Canadian provincial 
prime 
minister to visit Cuba in the past 17 years, described Fidel as 
a very hospitable and vigorous man and very knowledgeable 
politician. After commenting on the topics broached with Fidel, 
the Canadian official said that it was an interesting and 
easy-going meeting which was greatly enjoyed by the two of them. 
  Meanwhile, Dr. (Patricia Lang), president of (Lang-Everett 
Consulting Company), said that she was very pleased with the 
meeting with Fidel. (Lang) said that Fidel truly impressed her. 
(Lang) added: I have met with many prominent politicians and I 
have worked in many countries, but I had never found a world 
leader who was so knowledgeable about the topics of the 
environment and sustainable development.

<F P=106> [Roberto Morejon commentary from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Soon, Cuban unions will start debating the need to 
implement policies to reorganize national finances and to 
increase efficiency in all economic sectors. The fact that 
485,000 grass-roots leaders are the first to receive training to 
better organize discussions at work centers reflects the labor 
leadership's interest in [words indistinct]. Workers will voice 
their opinions on the viability of planned economic measures at 
open and democratic assemblies. The implementation of such 
measures or others has been postponed until a national consensus 
is reached. 
  In recent years, the population has created an excess cash 
flow that amounts to 10 billion pesos because of a smaller 
product supply. This resulted in a lack of motivation, work 
inefficiency, and a thriving black market. 
  In addition, the state operated with a budget deficit 
estimated at 4.2 billion pesos by late 1993 because expenditures 
exceeded treasury revenues. The financing of education, health, 
and social security increased the budget deficit because Cuba 
did not have access to international loans. 
  Cuban workers, therefore, will voice their opinions on the 
best ways to reorganize national finances, such as the 
possibility of establishing a tax system and reducing or 
eliminating subsidies for family basket products and channeling 
those funds to people who have lower incomes. 
  At union assemblies supported by their leadership, Cuban 
workers will suggest ways to face current irregularities, such 
as the fraudulent accumulation of personal wealth. Cuban unions 
will also discuss the fact that certain workers are not working 
as efficiently as their positions require. Meanwhile, there are 
people who reach legal employment age but turn down job offers 
because they think such jobs do not match their educational 
level. 
  Cuban unions will also discuss costs, profitability, 
efficiency, and productivity at these meetings, which seek to 
become another forum for collective reflection, just as the 
Cuban parliament already is.

<F P=106> [Report by Mario Munoz; from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" news program] 
  [Text] Under the present Cuban situation, the more than 
5,000 employees who work at the Agriculture Ministry's 19 
research centers have the responsibility to ensure that their 
efforts lead to less costly production and a bigger variety of 
crops with better quality and greater resistance. All this 
should be accomplished using less resources. 
  During 1993 research in the Cuban agricultural sector was 
aimed at faster implementation of production results and the 
promotion of scientific projects that would replace imports and 
attract foreign exchange. 
  The research centers carried out 79 scientific projects. 
Fifty of those projects were praised for their importance, and 
six received the Cuban Academy of Science's 1993 prize for the 
most important research projects of the year. 
  At a science and agricultural workers' meeting, Carlos 
Temprano, the official in charge of scientific activity in the 
agricultural sector, referred to the goals of researchers for 
the current year: 
  [Begin Temprano recording] They must help increase 
production and efficiency through Agriculture Ministry programs 
by promoting results and physical-technical activities. These 
activities should be promoted with less effort, more 
integration, and better quality in the areas of production and 
service, which the various research institutions are tasked with 
helping. 
  We must increase the scientific and technical level of 
researchers, professionals, and technicians from the science and 
technical units and those who work in productive organization 
and technical services at all levels within the institutions. 
We must attract foreign exchange and local currency to solve 
the most basic needs of the institutions. We must also reduce 
spending and meet financial plans. We must perfect the system 
to introduce results that promote mechanisms that will adjust 
this task to new conditions of production in our country's 
agriculture. [end recording] 
  It became evident at the meeting that there is a need for a 
better link between the research system and productive activity. 
It also became evident that scientists must enlarge the small 
work force existing in our fields. Scientists must also focus 
their research on initiatives that will result in the lowest 
fuel consumption possible. 
  Scientists who are linked to agricultural tasks agreed that, 
in view of Cuba's difficult situation, their research centers 
must seek their own financing by offering advice and training to 
interested institutions; all this must be done taking into 
consideration the high level of Cuban professionals.

  [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jan (EFE) -- El Salvador's Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) today, Wednesday, 
rejected in the Mexican capital any insinuation that attempts to 
implicate it in the Chiapas conflict. Incidents in Chiapas "are 
strictly internal problems of the Mexican state," and solutions 
should be reached while respecting Mexico's sovereignty, 
indicated the FMLN in a press communique sent to EFE. 
  The former Salvadoran guerrillas expressed their support for 
the peace initiatives through dialogue between all the sectors 
involved and regretted the loss of human lives in the armed 
conflict. 
  The FMLN reiterated that since the signing of the 
Chapultepec 
Agreement in January 1993, it is a completely legal political 
party, respecting noninterference in the internal affairs of 
third countries. 
  The former guerrillas condemned press and political 
statements linked to the ARENA [Nationalist Reublican Alliance] 
party that attempt to tangle the FMLN in the violent Chiapas 
incidents. They warned that these accusations are evidence of 
despair in the face of the FMLN's electoral progress with regard 
to the March 1994 Salvadoran elections.

  [Text] The presidents of Chile and Bolivia have been 
invited to the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
presidential meeting on 17 January. The Argentine delegation 
made the proposal. [Chilean] President-elect Eduardo Frei is 
also invited. 
  Patricio Aylwin, Sanchez de Lozada, and Eduardo Frei will 
hold complementary meetings with their Mercosur counterparts but 
they will not formally participate in the deliberations. 
  It is being reported in Santiago, Chile, that President 
Patricio Aylwin is studying the possibility of attending the 
summit, which will be held in Colonia on 17 January. The 
presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay -- the 
Mercosur member countries -- invited Aylwin and also his elected 
successor, Eduardo Frei, to participate. 
  Frei is unable to attend; he is resting following a inguinal 
hernia operation today. Chilean Foreign Ministry economic 
delegation sources told the afternoon newspaper LA SEGUNDA that 
Chile should send a high-ranking representation to the meeting, 
even though it is not a Mercosur member and clearly cannot 
become one.

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Dolores Oliveira in Buenos Aires] </F>
  [Text] Argentine President Carlos Menem yesterday ordered a 
"state of alert" among Argentine intelligence services in light 
of the possibility of a subversive resurgence -- like the 
uprising in Chiapas, Mexico -- in Southern Cone countries. The 
president caught his main security assistants by surprise. They 
attributed the initiative to Menem's "intuition." There were 
rumors that everything began after closed door conversations 
with Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle and Paraguayan 
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last 
week. According to reports published in Buenos Aires by the 
morning economic newspaper EL CRONISTA, Argentine officials who 
accompanied Menem in Punta del Este detected a fear -- 
particularly among members of Wasmosy's entourage -- of 
"hit-and-run forays" across Paraguayan and Bolivian borders by 
-- as Paraguayan politicians put it -- "narcoterrorists at the 
service of the Sao Paulo forum." 
<H5>  The Sao Paulo Forum </H5>
  The so-called Sao Paulo Forum was born in 1990 in the wake 
of 
a well-intentioned initiative by labor leader Luiz Inacio "Lula" 
da Silva to unify the Latin American leftist sectors and to lead 
them along the path of democracy, consensus, and government 
experience. 
  The Forum has already held four subsequent meetings, in Sao 
Paulo, Mexico, Managua, and Havana. Two irreconcilable 
positions emerged from within the Forum at the latest meeting in 
Havana. On the one hand, those who insisted on the political 
course. Among them were the Uruguayan Broad Front; the 
Brazilian labor movement; and Mexico's opposition PRD [Party of 
the Democratic Revolution], led by political scientist Jorge 
Castaneda -- the philosophical inspirer of this Latin American 
leftist group. On the other hand, the hardliners refuse to give 
up the armed struggle and who decided "to prepare for a 
rebellion by the victims of the economic adjustment." This 
happened just two months ago, in November 1993. 
  An intelligence report read a few hours ago by President 
Menem suggests some irregularities that might include a 
connection among the various attempts to begin subversive 
activities in Argentine territory.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf while </F>
vacationing in Villa Gesel by "special correspondent" Norberto 
Beladrich; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Beladrich] Everyone is still 
very well aware of what happened in Santiago del Estero, 
surely... 
  [Ruckauf] I am convinced that Santiago del Estero has not 
been a "victim" of the transformation process. What should have 
been done there was just not done. There was a chaotic 
government, very bad mismanagement of the economy, and an 
astronomical financial crisis. 
  [Beladrich] For you then Santiago del Estero is a unique 
case? 
  [Ruckauf] I did not say that; but it is very different from 
the rest because all the ingredients were right for an 
explosion. Think back to January 1993, the salary roster 
amounted to 20 million pesos; in October it escalated to 36 
million pesos, while income amounted to some 5 million pesos... 
Other provinces have problems regarding the income-expenditure 
ratio, but no province had such a bad ratio as Santiago del 
Estero. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Jan (NA) -- Defense Minister Oscar 
Camilion today admitted the existence of unconfirmed reports on 
the alleged participation of Shining Path activists in the 
social revolt that took place in Santiago del Estero. However, 
he said, "there is no specific information" about the subject. 
  The presence of an unidentified activist group was detected, 
Camilion said. The group took advantage of "a clear, 
spontaneous, situation" staged by the people who participated in 
the revolt. 
  In statements to Radio Continental, the minister said the 
presence of Shining Path activists in Santiago del Estero has 
not been confirmed and that "if there was specific information 
about an identified individual he would be expelled from the 
country." 
  He also said that another report mentioned the presence of a 
police officer whose last name is Chuk in the revolt in Santiago 
del Estero. The subject, however, was not mentioned during the 
internal security meeting held on 12 January with President 
Carlos Menem. 
  According to Camilion, during the meeting Menem "warned" 
officials responsible for internal security to "keep their eyes 
open" and asked intelligence officials to "obtain information 
and investigate." 
  "It was a sudden meeting, not to analyze an urgent subject, 
but to be alert," the defense minister said. 
  Camilion also said the government is investigating the 
origin 
of the fire in Misiones City Hall and the attacks on 
installations of privatized public services. 
  The possibility that drug traffickers might be financing the 
Zapatista guerrillas in Mexico was discussed during the meeting, 
Camilion said, adding that the national government "does not 
doubt they received a significant amount of money" from some 
group. 
  Although he said the internal security meetings will 
continue 
to be held, Camilion denied the existence of a predetermined 
agenda, adding that "in the short term no meeting will be held 
to discuss so many subjects as yesterday." 
  Regarding the 12 January meeting, Camilion ruled out that 
the 
presence of the Armed Forces should have any political meaning 
"other than that established by the Internal Security Law that 
states the Armed Forces can be called at the last moment to 
intervene in extreme cases."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Jan (NA) -- The national cabinet 
today decided to implement a strong plan to generate jobs and 
provide social aid in the eight northern Argentine provinces 
after President Carlos Menem's decision to place the security 
services on alert in face of the possible reappearance of urban 
guerrillas. 
  The cabinet decision, which appears to be directly linked to 
the president's concerns, was announced by Labor Minister 
Armando Caro Figueroa, who said that, among other measures, it 
has been decided to create eight management offices to create 
jobs and monitor Social Plan funds. 
  The labor minister did not want to discuss the measures 
adopted by Menem and his security cabinet regarding possible 
guerrilla actions in the provinces experiencing a social crisis 
by saying: "It is not good to make predictions." 
  He also downplayed the fact that the Armed Forces commanders 
were summoned by the president by saying that such an issue 
"must not be considered exceptional because it exists in all the 
democratic countries I know." 
  Caro Figueroa said the government "is not indifferent" to 
the 
decision of the General Labor Confederation (CGT) to hold a 
general strike on a yet undetermined date, "although we will 
continue prioritizing a dialogue" in an attempt to make union 
leaders change their mind. 
  Media Secretary Raul Burzaco said the other subjects 
discussed during the security cabinet meeting were the 
implementation of the Social Plan by the health and social 
action minister, a briefing by Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella 
about the possibility of granting Argentine citizenship to the 
children of Argentines residing abroad, and other reports read 
by [National Tourism Agency Director] Francisco Mayorga and 
[Natural Resources and Environment Secretary] Maria Julia 
Alsogaray. 
  Caro Figueroa said he first informed the cabinet members of 
the state of negotiations with the CGT and the business 
organizations. 
  Among other points already known by the public, the labor 
minister informed the cabinet about the labor unions' demands to 
make the government responsible for the labor unions' previous 
debts in keeping with the a law that has not been applied yet. 
"We will comply with this legal obligation," Caro Figueroa said. 
  The security cabinet created on 12 January by Menem will 
follow up the social situation in the provinces, on the lookout 
for eventual social revolts, Caro Figueroa said. He added: "It 
is necessary to adopt different measures because the labor 
situation is not the same in all the provinces." 
  That is why he announced the decision, which was approved by 
the cabinet, to create eight management offices to promote 
employment and follow up the distribution of social aid funds in 
each of the country's northern provinces. 
  These management offices "must not only guarantee the 
efficiency of the social expenses but also support the 
decentralization and reconversion process" implemented by the 
central government. 
  He said the reconversion policy in the provinces undergoing 
a 
serious social crisis "must be carried out with the least social 
cost possible," adding that "it is possible to implement these 
changes in an untraumatic manner." 
  When discussing the official decision to place the 
intelligence services on alert, Caro Figueroa said: "They are 
measures to guarantee internal security, and they must not be 
considered exceptional issues because they exist in all the 
democratic countries I know." 
  He added that it is not an isolated fact within the 
government "since all the policies, the economic policy and the 
social policy, go together hand in hand." 
  He denied that the concern over the alleged reappearance of 
a 
guerrilla group "came up just by chance," as well as the concern 
over the need to implement social policies in the troubled 
provinces, given that "the government has been concerned about 
the situation in the northern provinces for more than a year."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Jan (NA) -- UCR [Radical Civic 
Union] President Raul Alfonsin today expressed concern over the 
participation of military leaders in yesterday's meeting at the 
Olivos presidential residence. The meeting was held to review 
the security situation in the interior of our country. 
  Alfonsin said he believes it is right for the government to 
be interested in this issue, but pointed out that he would like 
"this issue to be tackled from a social and economic viewpoint, 
without apparent preparation for repression." 
  The main opposition party leader pointed out that he was 
very 
surprised at "the presence of the military leaders who, 
according to Interior Security regulations, should not become 
involved in this issue until the final phase is reached, via a 
decision that does not seem to have been made." 
  Alfonsin said the UCR is studying the regional economies. He 
said: "In February, we will have a panorama for discussion with 
the government because we want to change the direction of these 
talks -- instead of waiting for an invitation to join any 
commission, we will present our own proposals." 
  In remarks to Radio del Plata, Alfonsin said: "I have been 
talking about the deterioration of social peace for more than a 
year. I have traveled the entire country. Every time I return 
to Buenos Aires, I repeat that measures must be taken because 
all the regional economies are experiencing crises, some of 
which seem to be terminal." 
  Alfonsin emphasized that "it is absolutely impossible" to 
pursue the current adjustment program, which "might be possible 
if the private sector were hiring personnel fired." 
  The former president ruled out the possibility of guerrilla 
pockets cropping up in the provinces. He said: "Petitions may 
be tabled by people who are living beyond conceivable limits." 
  Alfonsin again endorsed the agreement he signed with 
President Carlos Menem on constitutional reform. He said: "From 
a democratic viewpoint, we managed to overcome a tremendous 
crisis, which I have described as disastrous." 
  Alfonsin noted that before this agreement "we were on a 
collision course," which "would have forced the UCR to refuse to 
elect constituent assembly members and to refuse to accept the 
new Constitution."

  [Text] The economy ministers of the northwestern Argentine 
provinces agreed on 11 January in Tucuman on "the need to adapt 
the public sector's national reform policy to the provinces' 
reality." Since the people's revolt in Santiago del Estero, this 
is the first sign of alert made jointly in disagreement with 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. 
  The meeting was attended by the economy ministers of 
Tucuman, 
Raul Paulino Rios; Catamarca, Herman Colombo; and Jujuy, Daniel 
Gomar; La Rioja Finance Secretary Pablo Manuel Aguilera; and 
Salta Public Works Secretary Julio Guzman. 
  The meeting was not attended by the representative of 
Santiago del Estero, where the revolt took place and whose 
government has been intervened by the federal government. 
  After analyzing the social conflicts that are nearly 
permanent in their respective provinces, the growing 
unemployment in the public sector, and the recent demonstrations 
staged by tobacco workers, the ministers drafted a critical 
diagnosis of the consequences of the national economic policy. 
At the meeting's end they released a short communique. 
  The most important paragraph of the joint declaration states 
"the need to adapt the public sector's national reform policy to 
the provinces' reality."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Jan (NA) -- Budget allocations for 
internal security this year grew by approximately 169 million 
pesos with respect to the allocations for 1993. The figures are 
included in the budget that Congress approved for 1994. 
  The following is a comparative table of the allocations for 
1993 and 1994: 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                  |1993              |1994              |Difference        |

|Internal Security |1,214,990,500     |1,353,106,754     |138,116,254       | 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|SIDE [Secretariat |159,922,000       |191,800,000       |31,878,000        |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  As for the security forces, the following are the figures 
provided for in the 1994 budget: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Federal Police:                       |560,962,000                           | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Border Police:                        |325,121,000                           | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Prefecture:                           |254,789,000                           | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  If these figures are added to the Armed Forces allocations, 
the total amount destined to defense and internal security 
amounts to 3,582,091,408 pesos, which is equivalent to 8.96 
percent of the 1994 budget.

  [Text] Montevideo -- The case of the 1-million-ton shipment 
of Canadian wheat that will enter Brazil from Canada at a very 
low price is closed. Argentina has asked Brazil for 
"compensation" to its growers to counterbalance the "unfair 
competition" from the Canadians. The Itamar Franco government 
has, however, already made its decision: "The state does not 
intervene in the grain market, which is absolutely free." 
  In a conversation with CLARIN, Foreign Trade Secretary 
Renato 
Marques said: "As of 1991, wheat purchases are no longer 
handled by the state. Today private parties freely import 
wheat. Brazil no longer exercises foreign trade control." 
  [CLARIN] There was the situation when Brazil granted 
Argentina compensation after confirming that U.S. wheat sold to 
Brazil was subsidized... 
  [Marques] That was an entirely different case. The United 
States was exporting wheat under the Export Enhancement Program, 
and this involved oficial recognition that wheat was being 
subsidized.

  [Excerpts] Return to the starting point at the Haitian 
parliament or, at least, at the Senate of the Republic, where 
bicephalism is back to its feet. On the afternoon of 11 January, 
six Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion [ACP] senators joined 
the senators elected on 18 January to dismiss the president of 
the Senate, Senator Firmin Jean-Louis. Grand'Anse Sen. Bernard 
Sansaricq said President Jean-Louis' management is at the root 
of the threat of dissolution of the Haitian parliament 
brandished today by the far Right. [passage omitted] 
  Furthermore, during this session at the Senate of the 
Republic, there was also the issue of setting the quorum at nine 
instead of 11 [senators]. After much discussion, the 
participants in this session adopted a resolution read by Sen. 
Osny Eugene, one of the parliamentarians elected 18 January. 
  [Begin Sansaricq recording, in Creole] We know that the 
Senate of the Republic must remain the champion of democracy and 
freedom that it is. As a Haitian, I was saddened to hear that 
200 people in Cite Soleil had lost their homes. Their houses 
were burned because the Senate was not there to do its job, 
because the far Right was able to go into the streets. In this 
respect, I personally accuse President Firmin Jean-Louis. If the 
Senate had been there to assume its responsibilities beside and 
leading the Haitian Army, the Army would not have let that 
happen in Cite Soleil. [end recording] 
  This was Sen. Bernard Sansaricq in his intervention on 11 
January at this session of the Senate of the Republic, a session 
in which the National Front for Change and Democracy members did 
not participate. We spoke of the resolution adopted at the 
Senate of Republic on 11 January by the ACP senators and the 
parliamentarians elected 18 January. The resolution set the 
quorum at nine instead of 11. Let us listen to this resolution 
as read by Sen. Osny Eugene. 
  [Begin Eugene recording] Article 1. In order to have at our 
disposal new and sufficient statutory provisions to allow us to 
face the serious climate of the times, the provisional quorum of 
the Senate is hereby set at nine members. 
  Article 2. The Senate Office formed by acclamation on 
Tuesday, 10 August, 1993 is and remains dismissed as of today. 
  Article 3. A new Senate Provisional Office called the Office 
of the Safeguard of National Sovereignty and Public Safety, 
designated by the acronym BSNP, is constituted. The mission of

  [Text] The ambassadors of the four countries friendly to 
Haiti are soliciting the Army's collaboration in facilitating 
the distribution of fuel. The diplomats, representing the United 
States, France, Canada, and Venezuela, invited General Cedras to 
create an adequate environment within the framework of the 
implementation of the humanitarian operation. 
  Specifying in a letter that they were not soliciting 
security 
assistance, the four expressed a desire for the full cooperation 
of the authorities charged with security in order that the staff 
in charge of this agreement may encounter no obstacle in 
accomplishing its tasks. A clear warning was therefore sent. Any 
obstacle to the distribution of humanitarian fuel would hinder 
the ability of the international community to send food and 
medications to the most deprived population, reads this letter 
from the four ambassadors to Gen. Cedras. 
  The Army responded to the Group of Four. Regarding full 
cooperation concerning the distribution of the fuel, Gen. Cedras 
referred the Group of Four diplomats to the government. Such 
cooperation, writes the Army chief, can be defined and ordered 
only by the government, which will give the necessary 
instructions to the specialized services of public 
administration, unquote. [no beginning quote as heard] Gen. 
Cedras, however, promised security for the unloading and 
distribution of the fuel. The Army could not escape its 
essential duties of maintaining order and assuring public 
safety, he writes in answer to the letter from the ambassadors 
of the four friendly countries.

  [Text] Opinions regarding the method to be used for the 
distribution of oil products continue to multiply. A group of 20 
deputies thinks that this fuel, designated humanitarian, must be 
put at the service of the people only and must not constitute a 
weapon for manipulation by foreigners. The group accuses the 
international community of exacerbating the situation by wanting 
to deliver humanitarian products to nongovernmental 
organizations who would be the only beneficiaries, at the 
expense of the people.

  [Text] The arrival of the humanitarian fuel tanker 
continues to cause much comment in Haitian circles. Father Yvon 
Massac opposes the arrival of this tanker in Haiti, as it is 
tangible proof of the hypocrisy of the international community 
in the Haitian crisis. Father Massac deems the mobilization 
"iron cuts iron" launched by President Aristide necessary in 
order to prevent the deterioration of the country's situation. 
  [Begin Massac recording, in Creole] The hypocritical moral 
standards of the international community want to paralyze 
Aristide by advocating the ideal of nonviolence, an ideal which 
is making him shirk his responsibilities as head of state. The 
country's constitution gives the president the duty of ensuring 
the good functioning of the state, of having all citizens enjoy 
justice, safety, and the rights conferred on them by the 
country's fundamental law. The president must create the 
necessary conditions so the institutions can function. The 
international community is making hypocritical statements. They 
are setting traps under the cover of humanitarian aid while 
people are dying. Can the president continue to stand aside 
while his people are being pulled down in Haiti? No! 
Self-defense must be organized. The president and the Haitians 
in the 10th department [abroad] must set up a force in the field 
so as to prevent the criminals from doing what they want with 
people. [end recording] 
  This was Father Yvon Massac, Fermathe parish priest.

  [Text] Kingstown, St. Vincent, 13 Jan, CANA -- St Vincent 
and the Grenadines minister of trade and consumer affairs, 
Johnathan Peters, has been relieved of his ministry and placed 
on leave until month-end, Prime Minister James Mitchell has 
announced. 
  Mitchell, in a statement released by the Government 
Information Service, said Peters, who has been in the United 
States since early December, will now be a minister without 
portfolio while Bernard Wyllie, formerly parliamentary secretary 
in the Communications and Works Ministry, takes over the Trade 
Ministry. 
  Wyllie was sworn in midday Thursday as trade and consumer 
affairs minister. 
  Mitchell said Peters had asked for an extension of time to 
conduct urgent personal business in the US after he had 
concluded official business there last October. 
  Peters is said to be sorting out problems with the US 
Immigration and Naturalisation Service and Mitchell said 
although he was assured Peters would be returning home it was 
apparent he was not likely to return soon. 
  "When his leave is up, I will address the matter further," 
Mitchell said. 
  Peters, a former ambassador to the United Nations, was 
brought home to contest the 1989 general election and won the 
north central Windward seat for the ruling New Democratic Party, 
which took all 15 seats. 
  Mitchell said he had asked the north central Windward 
parliamentary representative, Allan Cruickshank, and his north 
Windward colleague, Monty Roberts, to see after Peters' 
constituency "for the time being."

  [Text] The "feud" between the United States and the PRC 
should not affect Brazilian businesses, even though the United 
States is the number one importer of Brazilian products. Luiz 
Americo Medeiros, the chairman of the Textile Industry Trade 
Union (Sinditextil), has stated that "when the United States 
cuts the quota of one country it does not necessarily increases 
that of another. On the contrary, it increasingly seeks to 
apply more restrictions." Medeiros noted that the United States 
finds it easy to curtail the PRC's quota because the latter has 
not yet joined the GATT. The bilateral agreement between Brazil 
and the United States expires on 31 March and will be 
automatically renewed for another year.

<F P=106> [Article by Wladimir Goitia] </F>
  [Text] Montevideo -- Winston Fritsch, the Brazilian 
Government secretary of economic policy, yesterday denied that 
Brazil and Argentina have reached an agreement on the adoption 
of a Common External Tariff (TEC) of 12 percent for capital 
goods and chemicals, which will reportedly begin in 2001 within 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. 
  Contrary to what the Uruguayan press has reported over the 
past two days, Fritsch confirmed that there is still impasse in 
the definition of a protection tariff on informatics and 
pharmaceutical products, conventional capital products, 
commodities that are subject to quotas, and cars. "Until there 
is consensus on all products affected by the common external 
tariff, we will not sign anything," Fritsch told the ESTADO news 
agency. He said Brazil will not close any partial deal. He 
thus referred to the 15-percent portion of the list of products 
affected by the TEC, on which no agreement has yet been reached. 
Agreement has so far been reached on practically 85 percent of 
the list of products, with tariffs ranging from 0 to 20 percent. 
Fritsch said he believes the list will be ready at the end of 
the first half of the year. He believes more negotiations will 
be necessary. 
  Shortly after arriving in Montevideo yesterday afternoon, 
accompanied by Foreign Trade Secretary Renato Marques and other 
Itamaraty advisers, Fritsch met with Argentine technicians at 
the Argentine Embassy to continue negotiating the subject, which 
will be raised at a Common Market Group meeting today. 
  A consultant with fluent contacts with technicians of 
Argentine ministries has said that Argentina might agree to a 
TEC ranging from 8 to 12 percent for those products, provided 
this tariff gradually falls to 0 until year 2,001. If Argentina 
makes this proposal at the meeting in Montevideo, Brazil will 
reject it. Next Monday, Brazilian, Argentine, Uruguayan, and 
Paraguayan Presidents Itamar Franco, Carlos Menem, Luis Lacalle, 
and Juan Carlos Wasmosy, respectively, will meet in Colonia, 170 
km from Montevideo, for the 5th Common Market Council meeting. 
Depending on the impasse, the TEC may or may not be confirmed. 
  The TEC is not the only obstacle obstructing the 
implementation of Mercosur, which is scheduled for 1995. 
Regulations on origin, the deployment of duty-free zones, and 
the protection of consumers are other controversial, unresolved 
matters. Such matters have so far been analyzed at the level of 
work subgroups, at which the technicians of the four countries 
formulated their proposals. Those three subjects, along with 
the list of exceptions, will now be studied within the Common 
Market Group, which is an executive organ of Mercosur.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The 17 percent surprise increase in fuel 
prices implemented at 0000 on 11 January has irritated President 
Itamar Franco. He complained about the increase directly to 
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso in a telephone call 
early in the morning. The increase was not released by the 
Finance Ministry the previous afternoon, and this has been a 
practice in the Itamar Franco government. Newspapers and 
television stations learned about the increase through the 
distribution companies, while the resolution was not published 
by the official gazette until 11 January. 
  In addition to complaining about the increase granted on the 
sly, President Franco ordered that, as of now, all new increases 
will be implemented only after advance notice to the public. It 
was the president himself who, in the beginning of his 
government, adopted this initiative that fuel price 
readjustments would be implemented only after notifying 
consumers at least 12 hours in advance. "There will be no more 
increases in the dead of the night," President Franco said then. 
  According to Planalto Palace spokesman Francisco Baker, 
President Franco was aware of the fuel price increase, but he 
complained about the "failure in communication" that prevented 
the announcement of new prices to the public. As of 0000 last 
night the gasoline price increased to 219 real cruzeiros per 
liter, alcohol prices to 172 real cruzeiros, while diesel oil 
went up to 136 real cruzeiros per liter.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Luiz Felipe Lampreia, Brazilian 
representative before the international organizations 
headquartered in Geneva (Switzerland), yesterday said that 
Brazil can benefit from a tariff reduction in the U.S. and 
European markets. Up until 12 April -- when the ceremony for 
the final signing of the Uruguay Round of the GATT (General 
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs) talks will be held in Marrakesh, 
Morocco -- tariffs may not be increased. Lampreia, Brazil's top 
negotiator in the Uruguay Round, denied that the Brazilian 
agricultural sector was harmed by the negotiations. 
  "Brazil did not win, but is not worse off than it was," he 
said. In making an evaluation of the Uruguay Round, Lampreia 
admitted that the liberalization of trade for industrial 
products was more comprehensive than it was for agricultural 
products. "Negotiations over farm products are always more 
complicated," he emphasized. Lampreia said that Brazil could 
still obtain tariff reductions in the U.S. and European markets, 
especially on orange juice. The United States reduced tariffs on 
orange juice by 15 percent, and the Europeans by 20 percent. 
  Lampreia explained that the greatest progress made in the 
Uruguay Round was represented by the agreement on the rules that 
will ban the adoption of unilateral, arbitrary, antidumping 
measures. "The margin of arbitrariness will be considerably 
reduced," he said, adding that after the ceremony in Marrakesh, 
which will be attended by the foreign ministers of 117 
countries, the agreements signed in Geneva will be translated 
and sent to each signatory country. The Senate Economic Affairs 
Committee will begin studying the agreements by mid-May. 
  Lampreia said that there are no possibilities for any 
modifications. "Either the Senate approves them or rejects 
them," he noted. At the beginning of 1995, GATT will host a 
ministerial conference to evaluate the approval of the 
agreements, and will start the work for the creation of the 
International Organization of Commerce, which will replace GATT. 
Lampreia said the new organization will begin operating in July 
1995.

  [Text] President Itamar Franco has just announced that 
Sinval Guazelli is the new agriculture minister. Guazelli, a 
member of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], is a 
former deputy and former governor of Rio Grande do Sul under 
Jose Sarney [1985-90]. He currently holds the post of director 
of general credit at the Bank of Brazil. 
  President Franco also appointed Senator Elcio Alvares, 
PFL-ES 
[Liberal Front Party-Espirito Santo] as minister of industry, 
commerce, and tourism. Senator Alvares was previously the 
governor of Espirito Santo. 
  President Franco has to yet appoint the minister of mines, 
energy, and metallurgy. Senator Beni Vera, PSDB-CE [Christian 
Social Democracy Party-Ceara] is a likely candidate, although 
this afternoon he denied having been offered the portfolio. 
  President Franco further announced that (Djalma Moraes) -- a 
former chairman of Minas Gerais Telecommunications Company -- 
will continue to be acting communications minister. 
  Franco made it clear that the choice of the two new 
ministers 
is not due to the political parties to which they belong; it is 
his personal choice.

Mexico and our reporter Jesus Cazasola has been closely

  [Cazasola] Yes, Ana Patricia, good afternoon. Both the

No one should act beyond the law because the country's 
conditions so demand. Humberto Benitez Trevino said this after 
being sworn in as new DF attorney general. He said there will 
be no truce for crime and added that no economic or human 
resources will be spared to guarantee the security the people of 
Mexico City demand. He said he will act with energy wherever 
there is impunity. 
  Humberto Benitez Trevino took over from Rene Gonzalez de la 
Vega who in turn was appointed deputy prosecutor for preliminary 
enquiries [sub-procurador de averiguaciones previas] for the 
Attorney General's Office. 
  The new DF attorney general said that the firm hand of the 
law will be wherever impunity is detected. He also called on 
the institution's public servants to act strictly according to 
the Constitution, otherwise the corresponding punishment will be 
applied.

  [Text] Mexico City, 13 Jan (EFE) -- Various Mexican 
political and intellectual sectors welcomed President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's decision to order a cease-fire in the 
southern State of Chiapas to encourage dialogue with the rebel 
forces. 
  Presidential candidates for the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party (PRI), National Action Party (PAN), and the Party of the 
Democratic Revolution (PRD) viewed the announcement of an Armed 
Forces unilateral truce with satisfaction. 
  Luis Donaldo Colosio, PRI presidential candidate in the 
upcoming August elections, stressed that what is important at 
this moment is that the Indians' human rights and lives be 
respected. In an allusion to Chiapas, he also hoped "that this 
cease-fire will be permanent so that we can find peaceful 
solutions to the problems that afflict this area that is so dear 
to Mexicans." 
  PRD presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas said that the 
cease-fire is only the first step that should be taken to 
reestablish peace and recommended that both sides "confine to 
quarters" their troops to achieve conditions for dialogue. "What 
should be done now is to declare amnesty for everyone, release 
prisoners, guarantee medical attention for the wounded, and 
appoint a governor who has the backing and consensus of the 
people of Chiapas," added Cardenas. The unilateral truce 
announcement was, according to Cardenas, the result of pressure 
exerted by various sectors of society that had demanded a rapid 
political solution to the conflict. 
  PAN (the country's second electoral force) presidential 
candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos believes that Salinas de 
Gortari has made a "sensible decision," a decision that all 
political groups agreed with from the beginning. Likewise, he 
wants conditions rapidly established that will solve the root 
cause of the insurrection, such as attention to the historical 
problems of the area and many others "where bullets have not 
talked." Fernandez de Cevallos called on his electoral rivals to 
"abstain from actions and behavior that in some way could imply 
opportunism or be offensive to the people of Chiapas and society 
in general." 
  The Permanent Agrarian Congress, which groups together 11 
peasant organizations, gave its support to the president's 
decision and defined it as "a firm step to attain peace." 
  Saul Gonzalez, chairman of the Grand Commission of the 
Senate, believes that the dialogue between the insurgent 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) and the government will 
have to take place under conditions of equality and flexibility. 
In addition, he said, the bases should be laid so that the 
rebels can reenter national political life with the political 
party that best responds to their beliefs. 
  Political expert Pablo Gonzalez Casanova said that it is a 
mistake to think that the Chiapas conflict can be resolved in 
the short term, although he believes that the government decreed 
cease- fire is a positive event in the search of peace. 
Gonzalez, who is in Ocosingo, one of the villages most affected 
by the clashes, said that the recent cabinet changes show that 
at last there have been deeds rather than words in Mexico. 
  Monday's government changes included the dismissal of 
Government Secretary Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco and the 
appointment of Manuel Camacho Solis, up to now foreign 
secretary, to the post of peace and reconciliation commissioner 
to Chiapas. 
  According to various analysts, President Salinas de 
Gortari's 
decision to decree a cease-fire is the first concrete step to 
act politically in the Chiapas armed conflict, abandoning the 
military option after proving its uselessness in resolving the 
crisis.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal de las </F>
Casas, Chiapas State; from the "Vector 21" newscast] 
  [Excerpts] Good afternoon to all our listeners. Manuel 
Camacho Solis, special commissioner for peace and reconciliation 
in Chiapas, held a news conference this morning. He said peace 
will not be achieved with sketchy information. Hence, peace 
will be achieved with a dialogue and, above all, with 
understanding, he said. 
  He admitted that yesterday and today he received some 
messages concerning the possibility of holding a dialogue with 
the members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN]. 
However, we have yet to confirm that these messages are from a 
person who truly represents this armed group, he emphasized. 
  Manuel Camacho Solis also said the following: 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] Yesterday and this morning I 
received one or two messages through certain persons in 
different parts of the country. The first signs of the 
possibility of a communication have appeared, but we have a big 
responsibility. We must cooperate so the tranquillity generated 
yesterday is used to take a new step toward the achievement of 
peace. 
  We will not achieve this with poor communications, an error 
in the dialogue, or without taking into consideration the 
context of the region and the region's relationship with the 
rest of Mexico. What do I mean by this? I mean there is an 
organization, the EZLN -- a political, military, ideological, 
and united organization. Any error in communication through a 
false mediator, someone who does not truly represent the EZLN 
positions could preclude the possibility of really establishing 
a communication. [end recording] 
  Manuel Camacho Solis said various issues must be taken into 
consideration in these negotiations, above all the culture and 
customs of all these persons. In addition, Chiapas is a mosaic 
of culture, he said; adding that, for example, the word 
agreement and the word peace do not mean the same -- or do not 
have the same significance -- for any of the Indian communities 
in the region. Therefore, the goal must be mainly to achieve 
harmony. He added that the doors are open for a dialogue but, 
he emphasized, they are not open for opportunism. 
  The news conference was also attended by San Cristobal 
Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz. He said Mexico is currently afflicted by an 
endemic disease and will not be cured by the first dose of 
medicine. It requires an in-depth treatment which truly takes 
into consideration what occurs in this universe, rather than 
only in Chiapas, because Chiapas is not only part of the Mexican 
territory, Chiapas is also an essential part of the country. He 
said that backwardness and all the problems that have prevailed 
must be analyzed point by point and part by part. [passage 
omitted] 
  A march was scheduled for noon today, organized by various 
communities in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. We saw many 
children carrying signs that ask the EZLN to put down their 
weapons and emphasizing the state wants peace and harmony. 
  Also, a news conference held by representatives of the 
Mexican Bishops Conference ended a few minutes ago. It was, 
obviously, attende? by Monsignor [Adolfo] Suarez Rivera, 
president of the Mexican Bishops Conference, who issued an 
appeal to the people urging them to open their eyes because 
Mexico is now a different country. He said the armed conflict 
in Chiapas has awakened a hidden Mexico. Suarez Rivera 
emphasized that Mexico must undergo changes in its government 
structures, its society, and its Catholic Church.

<F P=106> [Report by Antonio Barragan from the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Mexican Episcopal Conference has formed a 
commission that is not intended to have any legal weight but to 
give moral support in the efforts toward reconciliation and 
peace in Chiapas State. This commission is composed of two 
archbishops and five bishops and will be headed by Adolfo Suarez 
Rivera, who is the president of the Episcopal Conference and 
archbishop of Monterrey. 
  Monsignor Ramon Godines Florez, the bishops' official 
spokesman, announced the creation of the commission when he 
explained the Episcopal Conference's stand on the Chiapas case. 
The Conference's position was presented in an eight-point 
document, which we will mention later on. Godines Florez 
basically commented on the cease-fire implemented in Chiapas by 
order of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  [Begin Godines Florez recording] It seems the suspension of 
the bombings and cease-fire are very important measures. We wish 
it was already in effect in order to begin a dialogue and seek 
reconciliation and peace. [end recording] 
  Godines Florez also mentioned the appointment of Manuel 
Camacho Solis as the commissioner for peace and reconciliation 
in Chiapas. He said that despite everything one must view this 
appointment with optimism because of Camacho Solis' great 
virtues as a mediator. 
  Monsignor Godines Florez noted that the NAFTA text must be 
reviewed because it was negotiated behind the backs of the 
peasants and Indians, who know nothing about it. He said such a 
situation could result in more problems in the long run. 
  With regard to the Episcopal Conference's position, I will 
sum up the eight-point document for you: 
  Point 1: The reason for violence in Chiapas is the misery, 
neglect, and scorn the peasants and Indians of that state and of 
other parts of the country are experiencing. 
  Point 2: We reject violence and the use of armed uprisings 
as 
a path to resolving true problems, such as misery and injustice. 
  Point 3: We think it is wrong and harmful that, in addition 
to adding suffering to their poverty, groups insist on a class 
struggle. 
  Point 4: We know it is not inherent of Indian cultures to 
attack adversaries because they have taught us hospitality and 
respect for human life. 
  Point 5: It would be belittling for the Mexican Army to 
commit excesses in fulfilling its duty when its duty is to work 
for the security and freedom of the Mexican people. 
  Point 6, which I believe is one of the most important points 
and one that the bishops mentioned last: In the face of 
accusations or suspicions that the church in San Cristobal las 
Casas, quote, encourages the armed uprising, unquote, the church 
stresses that if any Catholic Church member, by subjective 
conviction, decides to join the armed struggle, this is done 
independently from the mission they accepted as catechists. In 
any case, an accusation must not be based on assumptions but 
must be thoroughly proven. 
  The Chiapas bishops have consistently urged the rebels to 
change their behavior and act as Jesus taught us in the Gospel. 
We cannot accept such accusations against priests, nuns, or the 
bishop himself. We are certain the bishop has always condemned 
violence, but he has also reported the misery that, in this 
case, is caused by abuses in power and structures that must be 
changed. 
  These are six of the eight points. There are two more 
points. 
Point 7 states we are living an important moment in our 
country's history. It adds we must all change our attitudes. 
  Point 8 says: In conclusion, we urge everyone to pray, which 
is the force that changes our hearts in accordance with God's 
will. 
  With regard to the appointment of Camacho Solis as head of 
the Commission for Peace and Reconciliation in Chiapas, it notes 
all Mexicans must support the initiatives started by this 
commission.

  [Text] The National Defense Secretariat reported that in 
compliance with presidential orders, troops operating in upper 
Chiapas State to counter action by law breakers have 
concentrated in the villages or towns of Rancho Nuevo, San 
Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, Altamirano, near Las 
Margaritas, Comitan, Chanal, San Juan Chamula, and Tuxtla 
Gutierrez, Chiapas State. 
  The military personnel continue to perform social work in 
some of these communities, especially water and food 
distribution chores, as well as the distribution of other 
primary articles. 
  The Mexican Army soldiers continue to patrol the various 
communities to prevent possible attacks on the residents. Up to 
now no armed group has been seen. The National Defense 
Secretariat report concludes by stating that there is complete 
calm.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Francisco Morazan] </F>
  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina 
has said that in meetings with representatives of international 
financial organizations, they promised to help Honduras work out 
its economic problems and pay its social debt. 
  He made this statement after it was reported that these 
organizations are pressuring our country to increase taxes and 
utility rates, as well as to eliminate urban public 
transportation subsidies. "I have talked to members of the IMF 
and other financial institutions, and all aid programs seek to 
settle the social debt," he said. 
<H5>  Congressional Presidency </H5>
  Reina announced that those who aspire to be president of the 
Legislative Branch ended their proselytizing activities on 8 
January. He added that "all personal attacks, propaganda, and 
pressure to occupy that post are suspended." 
<H5>  Missing Persons Report </H5>
  He labeled the report submitted by Leo Valladares, national 
human rights ombudsman, on missing persons as a "white book." 
Carlos Reina believes that "this report indeed favors Honduras 
because it has plenty of information on this very delicate 
subject." He pointed out that the only thing left to do is to 
establish the procedure for implementing this report and 
complement it with another final report that will let the people 
know the truth about these cases. 
<H5>  Government Cabinet </H5>
  Reina emphasized that his cabinet will be announced in due 
time because he dislikes making hasty decisions. Instead, he 
prefers to give careful thought to the appointments. He also 
said that he is concerned that the media may report that he 
failed to appoint a specific person to some public post because 
he is not "fond of making offers." He added that some San Pedro 
Sula business leaders were offered posts in the Economy 
Ministry, but such offers did not materialize for reasons that 
he did not disclose. 
  Carlos Reina pointed out that Olvin Rodriguez has not been 
removed from the list of possible candidates for public office 
because he is not finished yet with appointing his cabinet. "I 
hold him in esteem; he has worked hard. He meets the 
requirements, and I will offer him a high position in the 
Executive Branch," added Reina. 
  He also added that members of the National Party of Honduras 
[PNH] will join his administration "in two ministries, as was 
the case during the PNH administration." These reportedly will 
be the Ministries of Labor and Social Welfare, and Culture and 
Tourism.

<F P=106> ["Official communique" issued by the Honduran Armed Forces </F>
Senior Council in Tegucigalpa on 10 January] 
  [Text] The Armed Forces Senior Council during its special 
session 01-94 analyzed the circumstances derived from the 
"Preliminary Report on Missing Persons" presented to the public 
by Human Rights Commissioner Leo Jose Rodriguez Valladares Lanza. 
  In view of the circumstances, the Council deems it necessary 
to state the objective and patriotic position of the Armed 
Forces to the Honduran people to prevent continued speculation 
on the subject by sectors not necessarily interested in social 
peace or the national well-being. Therefore, we hereby state 
our position under the following terms: 
  1. The Honduran Armed Forces, as a part of Honduran society, 
have developed and will permanently develop a plan to 
participate in actions for our homeland's modernization, 
reconciliation, social peace,and human and economic development. 
Our only interest is promoting the people's well-being and 
Honduran progress. We are aware of the fact that without our 
participation, we would not have reached the state of human 
solidarity and the opportunities for development we can justly 
expect today. 
  2. The historical circumstances that existed in our country 
during the eighties cannot and should not be radically analyzed 
or isolated from the ideological, political, and economic 
context that characterized the Cold War. During that period, 
antagonistic forces maintained a climate of confrontation not 
only in Honduras, but in the entire world. 
  3. Therefore, within the fast moving process of society's 
transition toward total respect for human rights within a 
pluralist and participative democracy, the Honduran State and 
its national institutions have clearly defined the levels of 
participation and responsibility in the efforts to reconcile the 
Honduran family and consolidate democracy. We feel we have 
contributed to those lofty objectives and we are proud of the 
role played by our institution, with loyalty, honor, and 
sacrifice. 
  4. We categorically reiterate our commitment to abide by the 
Constitution and laws as the essence for our professional duties 
and responsibilities. Within that concept, we believe that the 
entire process for investigating the actions that motivated this 
communique must be carried out based on legal grounds, and not 
on sectarian positions and obscure interests. 
  5. The actions carried out by Division General Luis Alonso 
Discua Elvir, commander in chief of the Honduran Armed Forces, 
have been and continue to be consistent with the task of 
democratizing and modernizing the Honduran State. The military 
institution takes part in the process of modernization and 
professionalization. Hence, we publicly express our strongest 
"vote of confidence" to him, supporting his actions. We also 
believe he should continue performing his constitutional duties 
as commander of the "people's armed branch." Hence, it should 
be clearly established that the Armed Forces and its commander 
in chief constitute an indestructible unity at the service of 
our homeland, and that it will act within the framework of the 
law to defend the institution's unity, permanence, and 
stability, for the benefit of the national community. 
  6. Finally, we believe that our fatherland should come first 
in our plans and goals. The Armed Forces have faith in the 
nation's future and will continue to be a decisive factor for 
the achievement of the people's aspirations, guided by the 
principles of national reconciliation and respect for the law. 
Consequently, we clearly and categorically affirm that it will 
not be the differences that separate us, but the ideals that 
unite us, which will help Hondurans build the fatherland we all 
want: high in the eternal dream of our civic glories and great 
in the minds of its best children.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] Pledging his commitment to "consolidate the 
political stability process" from within the parliament, 
Christian Democrat Luis Humberto Guzman was sworn in as National 
Assembly president. 
  Guzman was nominated for this position by Gustavo Tablada, 
who minutes before resigned as parliamentary president during an 
extended ovation. Marcia Quezada, third secretary, also 
resigned amid acknowledgement from the deputies present. 
  A total of 56 deputies attended the afternoon session, while 
the rest of those who have made a commitment to rejoin the 
Assembly watched the voting from the hallways. 
  Tablada made a brief speech, limiting himself to saying that 
he was fulfilling his commitment by occupying his seat in the 
parliament. 
  Tablada's proposal was supported by the chief of the 
Sandinist bloc, Sergio Ramirez. The Sandinist parliamentarian 
affirmed that "a very clear message is being sent that with our 
support for Luis Humberto Guzman we will work toward a consensus. 
  Ramirez said: "The UDC [Christian Democratic Union] took a 
brave step by breaking a taboo deeply embedded in this nation's 
unfortunate political culture." Ramirez added: "Tablada's step 
is equally brave." 
  Other parliamentarians joined in to support the candidacy of 
Guzman, who was unanimously elected National Assembly president. 
Immediately after the election Guzman approached Tablada and 
greeted him. 
  Armando Zambrana received similar support and was elected 
third secretary of the Board of Directors. 
<H5>  Internal Legislation Reformed </H5>
  Guzman began his first speech as president of the National 
Assembly by blaming the liberal-conservatives for the 150 years 
of retardation in our country. 
  "The idea of exacerbating the crisis (through a campaign for 
a constituent assembly) is absolutely immoral and crazy," the 
new National Assembly president said forcefully. 
  After the 1990 change in government, "a change in the 
political regimen can no longer be postponed in accordance with 
the exigencies of peace, democracy, and development," Guzman 
said. 
  We need an active and legitimate parliament, the UDC leader 
said. He called on the rest of the deputies, who were absent 
yesterday, to return to their parliamentary duties on 25 
January, when sessions are scheduled to resume. 
  After the swearing-in ceremony, the deputies voted on 
reforms 
of internal legislation as established in a Justice Commission 
document, the discussion of had been pending from the previous 
legislative session. Six articles were reformed. 
  The reforms establish that members of the Board of Directors 
should office for one year, while allowing for the possibility 
of reelection. 
  The Assembly president's duties are set out in the reformed 
articles, which also state that the Board of Directors will 
determine the session's agenda by a majority vote. 
<H5>  Ambassadors Call for Normalcy </H5>
  Roberto Urroz, secretary general of the Nicaraguan 
Democratic 
Movement, who attended the morning swearing-in ceremony, said 
his party did not take part in the voting because the Board of 
Directors should have been more representative. But, he said, 
this will not prevent the MDN [Nicaraguan Democratic Movement] 
and the PSD [Social Democratic Party] from joining the regular 
sessions later on. 
  "We hope more well-meaning deputies will start passing laws 
to benefit the people," U.S. Ambassador John Maisto told 
BARRICADA. The ambassador was forced to withdraw before the 
sessions ended because of health problems. 
  Maisto said he felt "optimistic" about events in the 
Assembly 
and described as "positive" the steps being taken by the parties 
which have announced their return to the National Assembly. 
  Papal Nuncio Paolo Giglio said he was optimistic about the 
deputies' participation in the opening session. "I hope the 
rest follow suit," the Vatican's representative said. 
  Chilean Ambassador Gaston Illanes said the ceremony was one 
of great importance and noted that hopes are now focused on 
complete normalization of the country. 
  The complete participation by the diplomatic corps was an 
important sign of the international community's support for the 
stabilization process implemented at the National Assembly, 
several invited guests said. Yesterday the National Assembly 
hall was not large enough.

  [Text] The Intelligence Service of the Ministry of 
Government has stated that "Vivo Rojo" -- a self-styled extreme 
left group -- is a "clandestine activist partner" within the 
Revolutionary Workers Party (POR). This information was 
disclosed today by Colonel German Linares, chief of the National 
Intelligence Service of the Bolivian Police. 
  During an exclusive interview with LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz, 
Linares asserted that the "Vivo Rojo" subversive group is not a 
disorganized faction within the Armed Forces but -- on the 
contrary -- "it bases its actions on the ideology of the 
trotskyist POR-Lora [whose leader is Guillermo Lora]." 
  Linares added: "Our investigations in various parts of the 
Republic reveal serious evidence that this subversive group, 
which is of a socialist tendency, plans its terrorist actions 
following the dissemination of bibliographic material that 
contains its doctrine. This is directed toward previously 
selected sectors of Bolivian society." 
  Linares said that "Vivo Rojo" has links "which, although 
unimportant, are particularly notorious among the small groups 
within the Bolivian Armed Forces that supply information on acts 
of corruption and irregularities to the clandestine group." 
  Linares explained: "`Vivo Rojo' takes advantage of these 
cases to write slogans against the democratic system, the 
government, and the high military command." 
  This statement somewhat explains the active presence of the 
group in La Paz, Oruro, El Alto, and Cochabamba, where its 
members have painted "graffiti" criticizing the current 
government and the Armed Forces high command, which they call 
"accomplices of the country's shortcomings." 
  The Intelligence Service chief disclosed that the 
investigations which started last year to definitely establish 
the presence of the extremist "Vivo Rojo" group, is classified 
as "B-2 Information." 
  Linares said that for national security reasons, and to 
protect the investigations, the State Intelligence Directorate 
is unable to supply more information on what is being done to 
"dismantle this clandestine organization" which he called 
"incipient and unharmful to our democratic stability." 
  The controversial police official asserted on 6 January, 
however, that the POR "is a latent threat to our democratic 
stability." 
  He said the methods used by the group to indoctrinate, to 
implement its partisan activities, and to disseminate its 
ideology explicitly reveal that "it is a political group which 
seeks by any means to discredit the institutions and their 
legally established authorities" and thus destabilize the 
democratic system in Bolivia.

  [Text] As a result of negotiations with the government, the 
coca growers of Chapare and Yungas will be able to sell their 
products in the nine departments of the country, said Guido 
Tarqui, leader of the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation], who 
participated in the negotiations. 
  He said that this agreement breaks the circle around the 
coca 
market. He added: "It will now be possible to take the 
products from the central markets to the different departments 
of greater consumption. This will help consumers because prices 
will fall." 
  He also said that branch markets will be established to 
allow 
producers to take the coca there directly. He said: "This will 
not affect middlemen, it will only serve to open up free 
marketing in the different parts of the country." 
  Tarqui indicated that during the meeting held on 6 January 
important progress was made in favor of coca growers, but that 
there are still several points pending on which the government 
must provide answers to the COB by 25 January, so that both 
sides can study them together on 3 February. 
  He said: "The regulation for marketing coca was approved, 
although some additions based on agreements for the Chapare 
region of Cochabamba must still be made. The only thing left to 
be done now is to promulgate the law based on the agreements 
reached with the government minister (German Quiroga)." 
  He added that another important point of progress was the 
government's full acceptance of the issuance of a supreme decree 
for marketing coca. 
  Regarding the pending points, Tarqui said that the 
government 
asked that the revision of Law 1008 on controlled substances, 
which coca growers have demanded be made permanent, be left 
pending. 
  Tarqui recalled that as a result of Law 1008 many peasants 
were subjected to abuse and attacks "because coca and cocaine 
are in the same bag." 
  He said that the decree on the participation of peasants is 
also pending. 
  Decree 22270 establishes the "equal" participation of 
peasants and officials of the National Committee for Alternative 
Development (Conadal), the Regional Committee for Alternative 
Development (Coredal), and the Local Alternative Development 
Committees (Colodal). 
  Tarui added: "We are demanding that equal participation in 
this case be maintained. That is, five government 
representatives, five peasant representatives, and one official 
who in this case would be the government minister."

  [Text] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy signed a "democratic 
agreement" with congressmen from all political parties soon 
after midday. He thus ended the conflict over the law on the 
Council for Magistrates. 
  After the ceremony, the head of state noted that this 
agreement has "a deep meaning that far exceeds the importance of 
its own objectives." He stated that "disagreements should 
always be surmounted through dialogue in order to set an example 
for our society, which has entrusted the different branches of 
government with the responsibility of ruling the country." 
Wasmosy said he hoped "this would be the starting point for the 
much sought-after national unity -- to the exclusion of no one 
-- so as to build a better Paraguay." 
  The president urged all levels of society -- businessmen, 
workers, trade unionists -- "to find this path of dialogue." He 
termed the agreement "a symbol of maturity." 
  "Today is 13 January, a controversial date in our history 
[on 
13 January 1947 the Colorado Party dismissed all ministers 
belonging to other parties in the ruling coalition, becoming the 
sole ruler of the country]. Well, let this 13 January be the 
date on which we embark upon the path to lift our country out of 
underdevelopment," he stressed. After the president's speech, 
Justice Minister Juan Manuel Morales, a signatory to the 
document as well, read the decree whereby the executive 
partially vetoed the law on the Council for Magistrates. 
  By virtue of the agreement, the executive branch pledged to 
veto only Articles 42 and 47 of the law enacted by Congress, and 
congressmen committed themselves to accepting this veto so that 
the law might come into force as soon as possible. Article 42 
pertains to the controversial issue about the required consent 
by the executive to the nomination of Supreme Court justices and 
Higher Electoral Court members. Article 47 deals with the 
procedure for the appointment of the prosecutor general. 
  On behalf of all congressmen, [Senator] Miguel Abdon Saguier 
[Authentic Radical Liberal Party] pointed out that he wanted to 
"reassure" Paraguayans that this agreement would not entail the 
manipulation of justice or its subordination to political 
interests.

  [Text] Lima, 13 Jan (EFE) -- Peruvian Economy Minister 
Jorge Camet today confirmed that the United States is 
withholding a large economic contribution offered for 1993. 
This is a result of pressure from the U.S. Senate over the 
human rights situation apparently linked to arrests based on 
antiterrorist laws. Camet said that the United States, which 
offered $105 million to improve Peru's balance of payments, is 
the only country of a group of six that pledged to help Peru 
achieve this goal that has failed to fulfill its promise. "The 
disbursement is being delayed by U.S. Senate pressure, perhaps 
because it is not properly informed about the human rights issue 
in Peru," the minister said. 
  The withholding of funds will apparently be the main issue 
that the Peruvian Government will discuss with Alexander Watson, 
assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, during 
an official visit that the high-ranking U.S. official will make 
to Peru from 18 to 21 January. 
  Camet added that Watson's visit to Lima "will have the 
important effect of unblocking the aid, because the United 
States is the only friendly country that has not yet honored an 
offer made last year." 
  Washington's concerns over human rights in Peru, according 
to 
various sources, are focused on abuses committed in the 
administration of justice during trials of people charged with 
terrorism based on strict antiterrorist laws. The discrepancies 
recently led to an incident between Peruvian Justice Minister 
Fernando Vega and a U.S. State Department and Congress 
commission in charge of evaluating the administration of justice 
in Peru. 
  Vega refused to receive the commissioners because he deemed 
"unacceptable" both the preliminary report approved by the 
commission and a letter sent to him by former U.S. Ambassador 
George Brayshaw asking him to receive the delegation. The 
minister said the commission, headed by jurist Robert Goldman, 
reported that the laws in question remained in effect "even 
though the commission was appropriately informed that the laws 
had been effectively invalidated." As for Brayshaw's letter, 
the minister said "it contained inadmissible terms for any 
sovereign nation," but he did not provide more detail. 
  The human rights situation in Peru improved significantly in 
1993, the National Human Rights Coordinating Board reported this 
week. But it did ask the government to rectify several legal 
norms for fighting terrorism, which in its opinion have led to 
an "alarming" number of arbitrary arrests. These laws 
constitute "a source of permanent human rights violations," the 
National Human Rights Coordinating Board also indicated. 
  The Peruvian Human Rights Association reported on 2 January 
that the number of arrested or missing people in 1993 "continued 
to be extremely high," with 87 cases, of which only 20 have been 
cleared up.

  [Text] Canada will resume bilateral relations with Peru, 
which were suspended on 5 April 1992. The announcement was made 
by Christine Stewart, the Canadian minister of state for Latin 
America and Africa. 
  At a news conference the ranking Canadian official said that 
her trip to Peru has allowed her to confirm the current 
situation in the country. She said she is pleased with the 
progress the country has made in the area of economics and 
especially in the area of human rights. She pointed out that 
the Canadian Government is willing to resume bilateral relations 
with Peru, which were interrupted following the self-inflicted 
coup on 5 April 1992, and to resume providing social aid for 
extremely poor sectors of the population. 
  [Begin Stewart recording] Our presence in Peru, which has 
always remained at the same levels in the past, focuses on 
programs to provide aid especially for the poor of this country. 
Overall human development and sustained growth are priorities 
for my government. [end recording] 
  Christine Stewart said that Canadian businessmen are quite 
interested in investing in Peru which, evidently, would 
contribute to the country's development. 
  [Begin Stewart recording] Private Canadian businessmen can 
also invest here for the improvement of Peru and also to 
maintain advantages for Canada. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 13 
January. 
  The Lima stock exchange registered a 150 percent increase in 
1993 after a 1992 increase of 273 percent. The stock exchange's 
profit was 79 percent higher than the inflation rate, which 
represents the best investment in the financial market. 
Specialists said this was the result of the major participation 
of foreign investment, which totalled 70 percent. (Lima EXPRESO 
in Spanish 3 Jan 94 p A24) 
  The legislative branch issued 16 decrees on the 
implementation of a new tax system by which all taxes were 
reduced to only 12: six for the central government and six for 
the local ones. This system was in force beginning 1 January. 
(Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish 4 Jan 94 p B2) 
  The National Exporters Association reported that the 
Peruvian 
trade balance registered a $532 million deficit with exports at 
$3.467 billion and imports at $3.999 billion. Exports totalled 
$3.484 billion in 1992. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 3 Jan 94 p A24)

  [Text] PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman (Hu Hiangming) has 
affirmed that it is up to the Chinese people alone to comment on 
the human rights situation in the PRC. The Chinese Government, 
in this way, responded sharply to reports from officials in 
Washington who link trade between the two countries to the 
internal situation of the PRC. The United States has reduced to 
35 percent its imports of textiles from China, and now there is 
talk at the White House of withdrawing China's trade status as a 
Most Favored Nation, according to a report from PRENSA LATINA. 
  Business is business, stressed the Foreign Ministry 
spokesman, recalling that the PRC has achieved remarkable 
successes since it was founded in 1949, especially with the 
reforms put into practice in the past 15 years -- which has been 
acknowledged internationally.

<F P=106> [News conference by Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani </F>
with foreign and domestic correspondents and an unidentified 
moderator at the Central American Villa where the Fifth Central 
American Games athletes will be lodged; broadcast in progress -- 
live relay] 
  [Excerpt] [Unidentified reporter] ...if the government does 
not give them a salary increase they may go on strike. 
  [Cristiani] The Fifth Central American Games have already 
begun. We believe it is quite clear that sports can serve as an 
example of Central American brotherhood and what characteristics 
all good citizens require. Obviously, as Salvadorans, we hope 
our team wins the upcoming games. We, however, will be 
satisfied if all participants do their best. 
  Once a year we review salary policies, and this is being 
studied right now, as it has been done in previous years. I 
really cannot see how they [public workers] can justify asking 
for salary increases after just three months since their last 
increase, or how they can then threaten to go on strike if no 
increases are granted. I believe this is mainly politically 
motivated. I believe public workers should trust the fact that 
every year salary policies have been reviewed, and this will 
also be the case this year. Nevertheless, we do not yield to 
these sort of pressures -- politically motivated pressures. I 
repeat, I do not think that this is proper just three months 
since the last increase. 
  [Moderator] Mario Jovel from the "Up to Date" newscast [San 
Salvador Canal Doce Television]. 
  [Jovel] Mr. President, yesterday Onusal [UN Observers for El 
Salvador] Director Dr. Augusto Ramirez Ocampo said that there 
were delays in the peace accords regarding land transfers and 
the reinsertion of former fighters into civilian life. What are 
the problems or difficulties, and might they not cause some sort 
of conflict? 
  [Cristiani] No, they definitely cannot create any sort of 
conflict. Although there might be delays, these are not new 
delays but a delay that has existed right from the start. You 
may have heard all of the reasons for the delays in implementing 
certain programs, but we are expediting things as much as 
possible. I believe Dr. Ramirez Ocampo said that although there 
are delays, the process continues to move ahead. This does not 
necessarily mean there are problems. 
  [Moderator] Carlos Dominquez, Megavision. 
  [Dominguez] Good morning, Mr. President. I have two 
questions. The first one: Yesterday we heard statements by the 
Ombudsman for Human Rights, as a member of the special 
commission investigating the illegal armed groups, when he 
mentioned certain delays to get organized. We would like to 
first hear your views on what the government is able to do for 
this commission to begin its work. 
  [Cristiani] We have said this commission is autonomous and 
that any delays are not the fault of the government, and we have 
not received any requests. We have clearly stated that we will 
help with anything the Joint Commission requests from the 
government, provided it is within our means. We have no 
influence whatsoever with what happens within the Joint 
Commission, and, therefore, this is their business. What the 
ombudsman should do is try to expedite things within the 
commission. It is not that the government is delaying things; 
we are keeping our hands out of it. Whatever they do is up to 
them. They may request something, but, I repeat, nothing has 
been asked of us up to now. 
  [Dominguez] Thank you, Mr. President. The other question is: 
we want to have your official confirmation on what is being 
unofficially mentioned or rumored regarding the alleged arrest 
of four Salvadorans in the clashes in Chiapas State, Mexico. 
  [Cristiani] We have not received any official report; these 
are press reports. The Mexican Government has not officially 
reported about them. 
  [Moderator] Jaime Atencio, Cadena Sonora. 
  [Atencio] Good morning, Mr. President. My question is this: 
This morning National Civilian Police [PNC] representatives in 
La Union reported the presence of Honduran troops in the village 
of Poloros. What is the government doing about it? Does the 
government know about this? 
  [Cristiani] We have permanent contact with the Honduran 
Government through our Foreign Ministry, and the first thing one 
does in these cases is to investigate to see what the facts are 
and then try and resolve it somehow through diplomatic channels. 
We believe this is the way to resolve these problems and not 
allow this to become a bigger problem. It is the Foreign 
Ministry that resolves these problems. 
  [Moderator] William Hernandez from LA PRENSA GRAFICA. 
  [Hernandez] Do you have confirmed reports on these troops? 
  [Cristiani] We have received reports from citizens. I, at 
least, have not received an official report from the PNC on 
recent cases or, rather, cases from yesterday. Prior to that, 
we had received reports from Salvadorans who have said that 
there have been Honduran troops in what is considered Salvadoran 
territory. Part of the problem is that many of the people do 
not really know where the border lies following The Hague 
ruling. Sometimes this may lead to confusion or to the belief 
that something is in our territory when in fact it is not so. 
In turn, it is necessary to open an investigation. Of course, 
it is clear that Poloros is Salvadoran, and this will have to be 
fully investigated and worked out through the Foreign Ministry. 
  [Moderator] William Hernandez of LA PRENSA GRAFICA [as 
heard]. 
  [?Hernandez] Good morning, Mr. President. I would like you 
to confirm the PNC deployment scheduled for next week. There 
have been rumors that it will be in Mejicanos and Ayutuxtepeque. 
  [Cristiani] No, the next deployment will be in Nueva San 
Salvador and Antiguo Cuscatlan municipalities. I understand the 
PNC graduation will be on 21 January and the deployment will be 
a few days later. 
  [Moderator] Wilber Gomez of "The Newscast." 
  [Gomez] Mr. President, regarding the PNC deployment 
throughout San Salvador, how many will there be? Where will 
the San Salvador National Police be deployed? 
  [Cristiani] We believe 340 will graduate from the PNC 
academy. We have no way of know how many may fail, but the final 
number is somewhere around 340. We understand there are 
approximately 40 additional PNC members who fell behind in some 
subjects and others who will be ready for this deployment. In 
other words, we are aiming to have about 400 PNC members for 
those two municipalities. The remaining will be deployed in the 
rest of the metropolitan area that remains under National Police 
responsibility. 
  [Gomez] But where will the National Police from these areas 
be deployed? 
  [Cristiani] To the remaining municipalities in the San 
Salvadors metropolitan area. [passage omitted]

  [Text] St. George's, Grenada, 13 Jan, CANA -- The chairman 
of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group, Grenada's 
Agriculture Minister George Brizan, has called on the collection 
of developing states to work out their own arrangement for 
survival in the face of the challenges posed by the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  "We in the Caribbean and in the ACP have to put our heads 
together to fashion out a package for the losers as a result of 
the new GATT arrangement," he told Parliament. 
  He said that only four countries in Latin America stand to 
benefit from the new trading agreement. 
  Brizan's comments came on the heels of a statement by the 
president of the United Nations General Assembly, Guyana's 
Samuel Insanally, who paid his first official visit to Grenada, 
urging the region to make its presence felt in international 
affairs. 
  He told government and private sector officials in St. 
George's the region had the opportunity and the scope for 
shaping international events. 
  Brizan spoke during debate on Grenada's 278 million dollar 
(one EC dollar - 37 US cents) budget, which allocated 30 million 
Eastern Caribbean dollars to agriculture. 
  Brizan said the region stands to lose under international 
trading agreements such as GATT. 
  "There will be winners and losers and countries in the 
Caribbean will be, unfortunately, losers in the GATT," Brizan 
said. 
  He told Parliament: "So far, neither in theory nor in 
international policy has anything been done to address the case 
of losers as a result of this GATT agreement." 
  He criticised the attitude of developed countries and 
international lending agencies toward smaller states, 
particularly those dependent on agricultural production for 
survival. 
  The Grenadian agriculture minister said the region would be 
unable to provide for its people if its special needs and 
concerns were not taken into account.

  [Text] President Rafael Leonardo Callejas reiterated 
yesterday, that the legal conditions to suspend Armed Forces 
Commander General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir are nonexistent. 
Thus, he said, the Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees 
in Honduras's (COFADEH) petition in this respect is inadmissible. 
  "No private organization has the power to order the 
suspension of the Armed Forces commander. This action can only 
be ordered by the corresponding legal authority," he emphasized. 
  Callejas, in his role as general commander of the Salvadoran 
Armed Forces, opened the session of the Armed Forces Senior 
Council this morning.

  [Text] President Rafael Angel Calderon has received the 
best evaluation in his entire term as president. The results of 
the latest Multispecialty Development Counselors (CID/Gallup) 
poll, which was conducted from 3 to 6 January 1994, indicate 
that favorable opinions on his administration surpassed the 
negative ones by 42 points. 
  Fifty-one percent of the 1,010 Costa Ricans polled by CID 
evaluated Calderon's work favorably. Out of those 616, 35 
percent said his work had been very good, and 65 percent said it 
had been good. In addition, 37 percent maintained that his 
government's work has been neither good nor bad; 9 percent had 
an unfavorable opinion; and 3 percent did not reply. 
  Calderon started his government in 1990. The opinions 
against him were two points higher than the favorable ones in 
November of that year. He continued to fall in the ratings 
until he got to minus 25 points in July 1991, which was his 
lowest point. From then on the favorable opinions started to 
increase, however, mainly because the period of economic reforms 
"with a high social cost" ended and current Presidency Minister 
Rolando Lacle--who is responsible for the official government 
campaign called "Costa Rica excels" [Costa Rica se supera]--was 
appointed. This perception of improvement is more frequent 
among people with a higher education and those who are Social 
Christian Unity Party followers and who intend to vote for 
Miguel Angel Rodriguez. 
  It is evident that when the Calderon Fournier administration 
ends the president will have the satisfaction of having obtained 
the backing of most citizens, making him the president who has 
received the second highest rating from Costa Ricans. In 
increasing order, at the end of their presidential terms, 
Rodrigo Carazo had a minus 65 points, Luis Alberto Monge had 
plus 25, Rafael Angel Calderon plus 42 points, and Oscar Arias 
plus 60 points, which is the highest score received by a 
president. 
  As in Arias' case, a president's popularity or high scores 
for a good administration are not decisive factors to win a 
campaign, as, after Arias' term, his party's candidate, Carlos 
Manuel Castillo, lost the elections. 
  There is a relation between the political party, the 
president's opinion, and the way people perceive the country's 
future, however. The polls show that the Social Christians as 
well as citizens with a higher education are more optimistic 
when appraising the perspectives for the next two years. This 
indicates that the current government's work has given them 
confidence for the future. In total, 28 percent of Costa Ricans 
believe the future will be better, 29 percent that it will be 
worse, 28 percent that it will be the same, and 15 percent did 
not answer that question. 
  If two lines where drawn--one to measure pessimism and the 
other optimism--we could see how, according to the CID/Gallup 
studies, expectations have been decreasing constantly. In 1990, 
negative expectations scored 65 percent, and this figure stands 
at 29 percent. In contrast, the feeling that the country's 
situation is going to improve has shown a sustained growth. 
Only 6 percent of Costa Ricans thought this way 14 years ago, 
and 28 percent do so now. 
  On this occasion, the poll asked what special benefit did 
the 
community, where the pollee lived, obtain from President 
Calderon's government. In order of importance, the granting of 
bonds, especially for housing, and the building and repair of 
roads were the specific benefits the people mentioned more 
often. Less frequently mentioned were the community centers and 
homes developed by First Lady Gloria Bejarano. The latter was 
the opinion of 35 percent of the people polled. In addition, 47 
percent of the citizens believe the government has done nothing 
for their community, and 18 percent had no opinion. The 
unfavorable opinions prevailed among those who live in the 
interior of the country and National Liberation Party followers.

<F P=106> [Report by Joe Alberto Briceno] </F>
  [Text] Actions by the large American countries, headed by 
the United States, were stepped up on 10 January to expedite the 
official announcement of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's 
candidacy to the post of OAS secretary general, diplomatic 
sources have reported. Those sources have even said that in 
Washington the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, and 
Brazil--the main promoters of Gaviria's candidacy--are the ones 
lobbying the most with other diplomatic representations to 
obtain the votes the Colombian president needs. 
  The sources have underscored that the United States does not 
want Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus to head the OAS, 
because, according to them, he does not meet the necessary 
conditions. 
  The North Americans want a statesman to head the 
organization, because they expect this will be the means to get 
their inter-American policy implemented with more multinational 
criteria, just as has been cited by Bill Clinton's 
administration. 
  According to news agencies, the State Department has already 
obtained the support of Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, and Bolivia 
for Gaviria's candidacy. Chilean Foreign Minister Enrique Silva 
Cimma has said his government views this candidacy with much 
interest, although President-elect Eduardo Frei will have to 
make the decision. 
  Costa Rican President Rafael Angel Calderon has said there 
will be "a hard confrontation with Colombia" if Gaviria 
formalizes his candidacy. He also reiterated that efforts will 
continue to unite all the small countries on the continent and 
elect the Central American and Caribbean representative. 
  Luis Guardia, the Costa Rican ambassador at the OAS, has 
told 
LA REPUBLICA that only Peru had advanced its backing to the 
Colombian in Washington and that this was not surprising, 
"because Costa Rica was the first country to protest after 
President Alberto Fujimori broke the constitutional order." 
  The Peruvian president has said his country supported 
strongly the Colombian nominee, and he said Gaviria is a 
statesman who also has a good integrationist spirit. 
  Guardia has explained that the 13 Caribbean countries have 
confirmed their support for Niehaus' candidacy and will maintain 
it if Central America "does not separate." 
  In talks with U.S. officials, Guardia has requested "they 
not 
take sides yet" and that, as has been their tradition, they not 
announce their choice until the end. Likewise, he has stressed 
the importance of respecting the management rotation principle, 
which prevails in Washington-based institutions, such as in the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Pan-American 
Health Organization. 
  Until now the Costa Rican minister has maintained the 
support 
of the 13 Caribbean and six isthmian states, as well as the 
Dominican Republic, Chile, Ecuador, and Argentina. The latter 
two seem to have modified their positions, however, according to 
reports coming from Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  Niehaus has said much speculation has been reported to stop 
the regional option, but he said: "We have a comfortable 
majority, and I am sure President Gaviria will think twice 
before making his candidacy official." He has charged that 
certain big countries consider they are "first category" 
countries and that small countries are "second category" ones 
and thus unable to manage inter-American forums. 
  Niehaus believes this attitude violates international law. 
He has added that the 28 March election will reflect if 
regulations will be respected or slighted.

<F P=106> [From the "Period, Same Paragraph" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Technical University Rector Jose Mauricio 
Lausel released the result of the fifth university poll carried 
out in December. 
  One of the main questions was: What political leader do you 
prefer? Here were the results: Armando Calderon Sol, 40.2 
percent; Ruben Zamora, 22.2 percent; and Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena, 
14.1 percent. According to this poll, Dr. Chavez Mena suffered a 
drop. 
  We spoke directly and exclusively with Dr. Fidel Chavez 
Mena, 
presidential candidate for the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] 
this morning. Chavez Mena raised doubts about the Technical 
University poll's credibility because the students filled out 
the questionnaires themselves, which, in his opinion, could 
cloud the poll results. 
  Dr. Chavez Mena says PDC-sponsored polls show both he and 
his 
party in second place. He called for public opinion to not be 
manipulated with polls like the university's.

  [Text] The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) 
remains the second leading political force in the nation with 
23.4 percent in its favor, according to what Technological 
University (Utec) authorities disclosed today. 
  Utec Rector Mauricio Loucel said that among the 
approximately 
2,061 citizens polled from the nation's diverse sectors, a total 
of 1,800 people--mostly of the younger generation--expressed 
their interest in the coming elections. A total of 40.2 percent 
expressed their preference for Armando Calderon Sol, ARENA 
[Nationalist Republican Alliance] party president and 
presidential candidate. Nevertheless, 56.6 percent of those 
polled said that the current government has not met its promises. 
  Likewise, 22.2 percent of those polled expressed their 
preference for Ruben Zamora, FMLN-CD [Democratic 
Convergence]-MNR [National Revolutionary Movement] presidential 
candidate, followed by Fidel Chavez Mena, PDC [Christian 
Democratic Party] presidential candidate, who obtained 14.1 
percent. Chavez Mena slid, however, by 3.4 percent since the 
previous poll was conducted, Loucel said. 
  The Utec rector added that candidates Jorge Martinez from 
the 
MU [expansion unknown] and Edgardo Rodriguez, from the MSN 
[expansion unknown] continue to obtain 10 percent in their 
favor. This represents a gap too large to overcome in the coming 
days. 
  According to the results, the political parties most likely 
to have representatives in the Legislative Assembly are: ARENA, 
in first place, with 35 percent in its favor, followed by 
FMLN-CD-MNR, with 23.4 percent, and in third place, the PDC 
[Christian Democratic Party], with 15.2 percent. 
  With regard to the voting card, of the 1,800 interested in 
the coming elections, 88.55 percent have the voting card, while 
11.45 percent do not.

<F P=106> [From the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The former secret service, known as S-2, must be 
investigated and eliminated once and for all, said Dr. Ruben 
Zamora, Democratic Convergence presidential candidate, today. 
  The leftist political leader explained that it is necessary 
to undertake a profound and in-depth investigation--which must 
also include the Army's Military Intelligence Battalion--to 
dismantle totally the apparatus that granted legitimacy to the 
so-called death squads. 
  Zamora believes these groups are very small and that they 
operate under the protection of the former intelligence 
services, and, therefore, they must be sought out and eliminated 
to end a yet unconcluded period of our history. 
  [Begin Zamora recording] It is much more possible now to 
struggle against them and eliminate them from our history. 
  I believe that, in this case, they must be sought out at the 
institutions in which they could exist; for instance, we know 
that the S-2, and the police are places in which the death 
squads had operated, and we know that in the National Police, 
for instance, they have hired personnel that were members of the 
Finance Police S- 2 and National Guard S-2. I would investigate 
there. 
  I believe the Army's Intelligence Battalion must also be 
investigated in this regard, as the former Secret Police, or the 
Army's former secret intelligence, has practically become the 
Intelligence Battalion. Those are the places where I think we 
should, or the Armed Forces themselves should, investigate to 
eliminate all of the personnel who could be linked to the past, 
which, I think, we all want to overcome now. [end recording] 
  In that same regard, the leftist presidential candidate said 
there is an apparent attempt at corrupting the National Civilian 
Police [PNC], which was created in accordance with the Peace 
Agreements. He also said it is necessary, therefore, to correct 
the mistakes that are being made, such as the transfer of the 
Commission to Investigate Criminal Actions to that institution. 
  [Begin Zamora recording] There is an apparent attempt to 
bias or corrupt--as I call it--the PNC project. What worries me 
most is the transfer to it of complete organizations, such as 
the Commission to Investigate Criminal Actions. There are 
people involved who are involved in tortures and the practices 
used in the past. 
  If you want to read about this, I recommend the last UN 
human 
rights report which, upon analyzing the case of Mr. Grimaldi 
[not further identified], clearly states that the United Nations 
already had the name of Grimaldi's assassin. They passed the 
name on to the Commission to Investigate Criminal Actions, and 
the commission refused, for one month, to put him in jail. [end 
recording] 
  Zamora reiterated the complaint of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front] that the Supreme Electoral Tribunal 
[TSE] is resorting to what he called little tricks [triquinelas] 
of the past to carry out a fraud in the next elections, in light 
of which the pertinent corrective steps are already being 
carried out before the UN Observers for El Salvador. 
  [Begin Zamora recording, in progress] ...little tricks 
[words indistinct] by the TSE. I think that is incorrect; it 
must not be allowed, because this country must have absolutely 
open elections. 
  At the same time, I want to say that I have spoken to the 
other candidates, the Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] 
candidate and the candidate for the Christian Democratic Party, 
and they have both told me they think we must allow the 
political parties with their representation. 
  I do not mean to say that Dr. Fidel Chavez Mena or Dr. 
Armando Calderon Sol are involved in these little tricks. I 
want this to be clear, because I have spoken to them and they 
have said this to me and, to honor the truth, I have to say 
this. [end recording] 
  The country's complex situation regarding the fulfillment of 
the agreements, the development of the electoral campaign, and 
the TSE's work are worrisome. There is still a will to 
continue, however, working for the construction of democracy and 
the development of an open electoral process based on the mutual 
confidence of the political parties cited by Dr. Ruben Zamora.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Salvadoran economic developments monitored by Panama 
Bureau through 17 January; source follows in parentheses after 
each item. 
  Jose Roberto Orellana, president of the Central Reserve Bank 
of El Salvador, has reported that resources close to 650 million 
colones were channeled to finance private investments in 1993. 
He has said the government created Investment Loans Funds to 
help micro- and small-scale companies. (San Salvador EL DIARIO 
DE HOY in Spanish 12 Jan 94 pp 3, 33) 
  According to Ruben Pineda, executive director of the 
Salvadoran Coffee Council, during the first quarter of the 1993 
to 1994 coffee harvest, El Salvador withheld 44,541 quintals, or 
20 percent, out of a total of 222,705 quintals that were going 
to be exported. The average sale price for this period is $75.83 
per quintal, whereas it was $68.40 during the 1992 to 1993 
period. Pineda has credited the retention policy for the price 
increase. (San Salvador LA PRENSA GRAFICA in Spanish 12 Jan 94 
p8) 
  Economy Minister Luis Enrique Cordoba submitted a bill on 13 
January to the Legislative Assembly to privatize the sugar mills 
owned by the National Sugar Institute (Inazucar) and the 
Investments Corporation (Corporacion de Inversiones, Corsain). 
The bill states that 10 percent of the shares will be sold to 
mill workers, 50 percent to farmers, and 60 percent to the 
general public. (San Salvador EL DIARIO DE HOY in Spanish 14 Jan 
94 p2)

odious killing. We immediately took the necessary steps with 
the Algerian authorities. Our ambassador has been received by 
Prime Minister Redha Malek. As you know, we had taken 
significant security measures, but of course, because the French 
community in Algeria is so scattered, no security system is 50 
percent efficient, or even 40 percent, as I said earlier. 
Unfortunately, this was proven true the hard way. 
  [Ayari] Will you be taking other steps? 
  [Juppe] Of course. In particular we are going to try to find 
out how we can reduce the number of staff at our official 
facilities, so that civil servants are exposed as little as 
possible. [end recording] 
  Asked whether France would close its consulate in Algeria, 
Alain Juppe answered, I quote, we have not reached that stage 
yet.

  [Text] Paris, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The commander of UN forces in 
former Yugoslavia, French General Jean Cot, may be replaced in 
the next few weeks, French officials said here on Monday [17 
January]. 
  A decision on replacing Cot, in command of the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) since July 1, is up to the United Nations, the 
officials said. 
  Cot is at present on leave in France for family reasons. 
  He was reprimanded last week by UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali for stepping out of line by urging NATO airstrikes 
against Serbian positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Known for his plain-speaking, Cot made repeated calls for 
special powers to carry out air strikes, whereas under a May 
1993 Security Council resolution only Butrus-Ghali has 
authority to call on North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air 
power. 
  Last week the secretary-general criticised Cot for his 
public 
remarks and for pressuring governments so as to be able to call 
in air strikes. 
  Butrus-Ghali has opposed air strikes for fear of reprisals 
against UN peacekeepers and of disagreements in the Security 
Council where Russia is opposed to any escalation of the 
Yugoslav conflict.

<F P=106> [Communique jointly released by the Presidential Office and </F>
the Prime Minister's Office the evening of 11 January on the 
devaluation of the CFA franc] 
  [Text] The heads of state and of government of the African 
countries in the franc zone have decided to modify the parity of 
the CFA franc and the Comoran franc in relation to the French 
franc. France has given its agreement to this decision which 
aims to restore the right conditions for lasting economic growth 
by enabling the resumption of international funding. This 
decision will consolidate the recovery efforts in which many 
countries in the franc zone are already involved. 
  France, which is in the front rank of the international 
financial community, will not fail to show its solidarity with 
its partners. To this end, it will closely follow and 
participate in the implementation of the necessary accompaying 
measures, particularly those intended to support the most 
underprivileged populations. 
  France will step up its effort to promote economic and 
social 
development. New measures to cancel and reduce the debt have 
also been decided in continuation of the action taken in this 
sphere by President Francois Mitterrand. These different 
measures bear witness to France's resolute and tangible support 
for the franc zone and to the preferential ties it maintains 
with its partners."

France Telecom in Vietnam"] 
  [Text] France Telecom reportedly is about to sign a 
framework cooperation accord with the Vietnamese postal and 
telecommunications authorities involving the installation of 
300,000 to 500,000 telephone lines within a three-year period. 
The accord represents an investment of approximately 3-5 
billion French francs. It will be announced during Industry 
Minister Gerard Longuet's visit to Vietnam, and it will be 
initialed by France Telecom President Marcel Roulet and his 
Vietnamese counterpart in Hanoi in late February. 
  For the moment, the French telecommunications operator has 
restricted itself to acknowledging that "the ministry has 
prepared a memorandum of cooperation." The legal aspects of the 
agreement remain to be defined. This accord would move France 
from fourth to second place among foreign investors in the SRV, 
following Taiwan ($1.5 billion in capital investments), but 
ahead of Hong Kong and South Korea. There are four legal 
formulas for foreign investments in Vietnam: a simple 
cooperation contract; a 100-percent subsidiary; a joint venture 
with minimum foreign participation of 30 percent; and the BOT 
(Build Operate Transfer), which stipulates the transfer of the 
foreign partner's operations to the Vietnamese state after a 
specified period of time. The Vietnamese partner favors the 
last formula, whereas France Telecom prefers a joint venture.

<F P=106> [Editorial:"Improved Relations Between France and China"] </F>
  [Text] There are two possible interpretations of the joint 
communique released on 12 January by France and China to 
announce that after deteriorating relations between the two 
coutries, in the wake of the sale of Mirage aircraft to Taiwan, 
relations are now back to normal. For Beijing, the communique 
means that France has agreed to all Chinese demands, promising 
not to sign new armament contracts with Taiwan in exchange for 
an end to trade sanctions. So Deng Xiaoping's intransigence 
seems to have paid off. 
  Unsurprisingly, Paris' interpretation is quite different, to 
say the least, which shows the benefits -- or the limitations -- 
of the equivocal diplomatic language. In order to patch up 
relations with China, which had gone sour as a result of his 
socialist predecessors's action, and above all because of the 
sale of Mirage aircraft to Taiwan, Mr. Balladur has agreed to 
take into account China's political needs, but reserves the 
right to use a -- small -- way out: France may approve some 
arms sales provided they are not considered as threatening -- 
and offensive -- for China. Still according to Paris, then, 
French firmness would have prevailed. 
  In fact, both sides needed to unlock the situation. Paris 
wanted to cut its trade balance deficit and give French 
companies a new chance to do business in China. Above all, it 
wanted to reestablish relations with one of the world's foremost 
political, military, and economic powers, and not be cut off 
from the huge Chinese market. 
  For China -- which has been squabbling with the United 
States 
over human rights, trade, and exports of atomic and missile 
technology; and which is currently in a row with Britain over 
Hong Kong -- restoring friendly ties with France was a way of 
putting an end to a certain isolation. 
  So all is well that ends well. Provided Mr. Balladur manages 
to meet expectations aroused during his visit to China "in the 
near future." In the meantime, he has asked Mr. Peyrefitte 
[former minister of De Gaule] to be the first one to go to 
Beijing. But will the latter be able to convey the French 
determination to his hosts in such a way that they give up any 
hope of brazenly pressuring Paris into accepting their point of 
view in the future? 
  One would be mistaken to believe in a necessarily bright 
future. The Chinese have shown in just how little regard they 
hold their promises of trade advantages. The eagerness to enter 
the fray demonstrated by French companies already counting aloud 
the billions of francs they stand to make does not strike one as 
particularly appropriate. Beijing -- convinced that 
"hypocritical" Western concerns for human rights will eventually 
be superseded by greed -- is bound to take advantage of it to 
raise the stakes. Subsequently, other large industrial powers 
such as Germany will have to be reckoned with.

Mitterrand waded into France's "war of the schools" on Thursday 
[13 January], attacking conservative Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur and cheering on the left ahead of a massive 
demonstration planned for Sunday. 
  The socialist president condemned Balladur's "unfortunate 
initiative" in rushing a bill through the senate that granted 
unlimited use of public funds to the country's private, mainly 
Catholic, schools. 
  In an interview with the socialist weekly VENDREDI, 
Mitterrand said the state education system felt unfairly treated 
and that he "understood" the anger of teachers and parents. 
  Teachers unions and parents associations as well as 
left-wing 
organisations are planning a big demonstration against the new 
legislation on Sunday and hope to draw 300,000 people on to the 
Paris boulevards. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Varley] </F>
  [Text] Paris, Jan 14 (AFP) -- The French left is pressing 
ahead with plans for a massive demonstration here on Sunday [16 
January] after claiming victory in a row with the conservative 
government over private school funding. 
  The left hoped to convert a try into a goal after the nine 
"wise men" of France's constitutional court cancelled the key 
part of a controversial education bill that had revived the 
country's long-running "schools war." 
  The Paris demonstration was originally planned to protest 
the 
new legislation which granted unlimited use of public funds to 
the country's private, mainly Catholic, schools. 
  But the court slapped it down, ruling that the central 
article of the bill was unconstitutional because it upset the 
balance between the state and private school systems. 
  A crowd of between 300,000 and 350,000 was expected to march 
through the city for most of the day on Sunday, grouping 
teachers, students and parents' associations, trade unions and 
freemasons as well as socialists and communists. 
  Organisers hired 66 special trains and 1,800 buses to bring 
demonstrators into the capital from the provinces. 
  The court ruling was the left's first victory over 
conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur since it was 
heavily defeated in legislative elections last March. 
  Socialist Party leader Michel Rocard is eager to capitalise 
on the win as his party prepares for a series of conferences 
aimed at building a broad centre-left coalition ahead of next 
year's presidential elections. 
  Rocard termed the ruling a "victory" for the left and 
renewed 
his calls for a big turnout on Sunday. 
  Balladur, who had come under fire from both left and right 
after the education bill was rushed through the senate last 
month in the middle of the night, beat a hasty retreat after the 
court ruling. 
  Government spokesman Nicolas Sarkozy said it would be 
"imprudent" to submit a new education bill for the moment while 
Education Minister Francois Bayrou called for "dialogue" and 
said he wanted to "restore the self-confidence of the state 
education system." 
  One reason for going ahead with Sunday's demonstration was 
the difficulty of calling it off at short notice, but Balladur 
will be carefully watching the turnout and hoping that the 
cancellation of the law will dampen enthusiasm. 
  It was undoubtedly a reversal for the prime minister but 
this 
was preferable to being forced to defend an increasingly 
indefensible corner, analysts said. 
  Although Balladur has been consistently popular in opinion 
polls since become prime minister in April, the schools law was 
definitely unpopular, with most people believing that additional 
funds for private schools could only come at the expense of the 
public school system. 
  Polls this week showed that 50 percent of the French thought 
the law was wrong against 34 percent who approved of it. 
Another poll said that 40 percent supported Sunday's 
demonstration, with 21 percent against and 30 percent undecided. 
  Socialist President Francois Mitterrand waded into the 
controversy on Thursday, attacking Balladur for his "unfortunate 
initiative" and cheering on the left. 
  Worse still, the bill was also criticised on the right. 
Jacques Chirac, leader of Balladur's own neo-Gaullist Rally for 
the Republic (RPR) party and a rival to the prime minister as 
possible candidate in 1995 presidential elections, said he 
"understands perfectly" that there were "reservations" about the 
way the bill was voted. 
  Former conservative prime minister Raymond Barre strongly 
attacked it as "a signal blunder" and called for a new 
parliamentary debate. National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin 
weighed in with an ode in praise of the secular education system. 
  Balladur counterattacked, allocating 440 million dollars for 
urgent repairs in state schools while arguing that the bill was 
an "act of fairness" and "an election promise that had to be 
kept." 
  That cash will still be spent, amid general relief in the 
government that the constitutional court got it off the hook.

  [Excerpt] Paris, Jan 15 (AFP) -- Hundreds of thousands of 
people are expected to demonstrate in support of public schools 
Sunday [16 January] after France's top court struck down a law 
on private school funding, handing Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur his first serious political setback. 
  Organisers were hoping for between 100,000 and 300,000 
supporters on the march through Paris in a demonstration called 
before Thursday's Constitutional Court ruling annulled a 
controversial education bill that granted unlimited use of 
public funds to the country's private, mainly Roman Catholic 
schools. 
  The court ruled that the central article of the bill was 
unconstitutional because it upset the balance between the state 
and private school systems. 
  The protest was expected to attract teachers, students and 
parents' associations, trade unionists and freemasons as well as 
socialists and communists. 
  The court ruling was the left's first victory over the 
conservative premier since its crushing defeat in general 
elections last March, and the opposition Socialist party hopes 
to use the march as a springboard to revive its political 
fortunes. 
  In an effort to soothe passions unleashed by France's 
long-running "school wars," Balladur indicated Friday that he 
wanted to launch a public debate on "the future of the public 
education system," its funding and organisation. 
  Socialist leader Michel Rocard is eager to capitalise on the 
win as his party prepares for a series of conferences aimed at 
building a broad centre-left coalition ahead of next year's

  [Excerpts] Paris, Jan 16 (AFP) -- A mass demonstration in 
support of public schools got underway in Paris Sunday [16 
January] with up to 500,000 people joining the march despite a 
court ruling that struck down a controversial private schools 
financing law. 
  The demonstration, set to begin at 1000 GMT, was delayed a 
half hour because of the amount of people joining the procession 
which began under a cold drizzle from the Place de la Republique 
to the Place de la Nation. It was expected to last until the 
end of the afternoon. 
  Hundreds of buses had arrived in the capital overnight 
Saturday carrying teachers from the provinces and the state 
railway system had also scheduled dozens of special trains. 
[passage omitted] 
  Several union and political leaders headed the procession 
Sunday including Socialist leader Michel Rocard and Communist 
leader Georges Marchais. 
  Union officials said they wanted some "serious negotiations" 
with the government and that they would ask Balladur to pass a 
law setting up a special budget for education. 
  The demonstrators carried banners that read "Republic, 
public 
schools," and shouted the same slogan. 
  Several placards demanded the resignation of the minister of 
education, Francois Bayrou, who had pushed for the private 
schools financing law and has since come under strong criticism. 
  Union leader Marc Blondel said Bayrou was obviously a 
partisan of private schools. 
  "No one has the right to say that we provoked this, it's not 
true," Blondel said. "It's Bayrou who provoked it." 
  Several opposition members also did not hide the fact that 
they would use the issue to try and mobilise support for their 
cause especially after the crushing defeat suffered by the 
socialists during last year's legislative elections. [passage

  [Text] Paris, Jan 17 (AFP) -- Education Minister Francois 
Bayrou said Monday [17 January] he would not resign despite 
calls for his ouster during a mammoth demonstration here Sunday 
to protest his plan for unlimited financing of private schools 
by local authorities. 
  "One does not serve as education minister if one cannot 
handle a crisis. One should not be a sailor if one is seasick," 
he said in interview with the radio station Europe 1. 
  Bayrou said he did not think that the leftist-backed 
demonstration, which drew hundreds of thousands of people from 
all over France, signaled a resurgence of the leftist 
opposition, which had seemed demoralized since its defeat at the 
polls last March. 
  "One should not look at what happened yesterday in strictly 
political terms," he noted. "We do not want this to become a 
pretext for playing politics in order to revive a struggling 
political party or politicians who are responsible for the 
current state of French schools." 
  He also backed a proposal by Socialist Party Michel Rocard 
to 
convene a national forum on education. 
  Organisers said the demonstration drew more than one 
million, 
although police set the figure much lower. But the number of 
participants seemed well in excess of the 350,000 originally 
expected by organisers. 
  The demonstrators, many of whom arrived aboard dozens of 
special trains and thousands of buses, waved banners calling for 
the resignation of Education Minister Francois Bayrou, beat 
drums, blew whistles and played bagpipes under grey skies and 
drizzling rain. 
  The protest was called to denounce a reform of the financing 
of private, mainly Catholic schools, adopted by parliament in 
December and it drew on France's deeply ingrained anti-clerical 
tradition on the left. 
  The new legislation was annulled Thursday as inegalitarian 
by 
the constitutional court, France's highest constitutional 
authority.

<F P=106> [Interview with French Economy Minister Edmond Alphandery by </F>
Jean-Pierre Robin; place and date not given: "Alphandery 
Expects 1.4-Percent Growth in 1994"] 
  [Text] [Robin] The recession is over, but recovery has 
not yet started. How can this interim period be described? 
  [Alphandery] It is a transitional phase and therefore has 
highs and lows, and variable results according to the sectors. 
The United States experienced that in 1992 before returning to 
clear growth. Getting out of a recession is always 
characterized by up- and downward movements. In France, the 
economy certainly grew very modestly and at a rate which was 
scarcely perceptible in the second and third quarters of 1993 
(up 0.2 percent in each), whereas the beginning of the fourth 
quarter was marked by an upsurge in activity. 
<H5>  Positive Signs </H5>
  [Robin] What signs now make you feel fairly optimistic and 
which suggest that the lowest point has really been passed? 
  [Alphandery] There are at least two positive signs. First, 
the order and export sales books are filling up considerably, 
which reflects both an improvement in the international 
environment and the high level of competitiveness which our 
products have. Moreover, the demand for houses is improving; in 
September, October, and November, there was a 10-percent 
increase in new homes started, and planning applications for new 
houses increased by 12 percent over the previous three months. 
  Another encouraging sign is that inquiries into the economic 
situation among corporate managers show a return of optimism. 
Better prospects for economic activity are emerging, especially 
in the opinion poll carried out very recently by the small- and 
medium- sized enterprises' capital fund. 
  [Robin] Surely the most worrying sign on this instrument 
panel is the psychological factor, the feeling of anxiety which 
is prompting a kind of consumption stop. 
  [Alphandery] It is true that consumer spending has become 
irregular for some time. It had increased by 0.6 to 0.7 percent 
in the second and third quarters and was moving in the wrong 
direction at the beginning of the fall. It is increasing partly 
thanks to the sales. We will closely monitor the consumer 
figures for December and January when there are widespread 
promotional sales, in order to form a more accurate view of the 
trend. 
<H5>  Confidence a Key Factor </H5>
  [Alphandery continues] The confidence felt by households and 
managers chiefs is obviously a key factor in the recovery. The 
change in climate will come as progress is made. The strong 
reduction in interest rates, which we recorded, has begun to 
produce positive effects, particularly by reducing the 
enterprises' financial costs. In this context of a gradual 
return of confidence, our economic growth forecasts of 1.4 
percent in 1994 have no reason to be changed for the time being. 
Among other things, they are based on an expected 0.7-percent 
increase in household consumption, which is, after all, modest. 
It is modest because it would be enough, for intance, for the 
French to turn just 5 percent of their savings in SICAV's 
[Open-End Investment Company] into consumer spending to achieve 
this increase. 
  [Robin] Are the French leaders right to constantly highlight 
international constraints, as if we really had no freedom to 
solve our own problems? Why stick to what is happening in 
Germany, is this not a resigned attitude? 
  [Alphandery] It is important to realize that, in our 
economies, which are very open to the outside world, it is not 
possible to pursue an economic policy which runs completely 
counter to the international environment. The unfortunate 
experience of 1981 must serve as a lesson. Of course, the 
situation in Germany, which is our main customer, is not very 
buoyant. Growth there will be at best between 0 and 1 percent 
this year. But, fortunately, there are other parts of the world 
which are attracting foreign demand: The recovery in North 
America is considerable and it is already having beneficial 
effects in France and in Europe. 
<H5>  Crediblity Restored </H5>
  [Alphandery continues] Moreover, there are means of action, 
even in the present context. And we cannot be accused of doing 
nothing. Despite little financial room to maneuver, we have 
succeeded in pursuing an imaginative policy of supporting 
economic activity by mobilizing short-term saving by the French 
people. That has been done in particular through the Balladur 
loan issue which served as an interim measure, pending 
privatizations, to finance measures to promote the housing 
sector and the small- and medium- sized enterprises in 
particular. Finally, we have taken significant measures to 
ensure the recovery of state and social security accounts. 
  These provisions, which are certainly painful at the start, 
have not been without effect. For instance, the credibility 
restored to our monetary policy has made it possible to 
virtually wipe out our interest rate differential with Germany. 
In so doing, we have succeeded in creating a more favorable 
climate for recovery. 
  [Robin] The French people have only recently rediscovered 
the market economy and its cyclical fluctuations, which are 
well-known facts in the United States. What are you saying to 
them to make them accept that such developments are normal and 
are better than the rigid and interventionist economic system 
which has prevailed in our country since 1945? 
  [Alphandery] The previous recession in France dates back to 
1975 and was the result of the first oil crisis. When the world 
was suffering the effects of the second oil crisis in the early 
eighties, France thought it could escape them by pursuing a 
counter-cyclical policy. It must be admitted that the recession 
was avoided temporarily but at what a cost! It subsequently 
gave us permanently slower growth. Our economy only returned to 
cruising speed from 1988, whereas the United States, Germany, 
and Japan returned to growth as early as 1983. 
  [Robin] The recession of the nineties lasted three years, 
assuming it is now over. Does it not reflect more fundamental 
problems? What is this feeling of doom which prevails among 
many French people? 
  [Alphandery] The recession appears to be so painful in our 
country because it is accompanied by the need to tackle some 
major structural problems, especially on the employment front. 
The two phenomena must not be confused. In 1988, amid economic 
euphoria, France already had a 9-percent unemployment rate, much 
higher than in Germany and the United States. The Japanese 
economy experienced a serious recession in 1993. And yet the 
unemployment rate is still around 2.5 percent. 
  [Robin] The prime minister has just admitted that "the 
crisis is even worse than we thought when we came to power." In 
what respect in particular? 
  [Alphandery] In March 1993, everybody still underestimated 
the scale of the recession which we had inherited. It had grown 
considerably worse from fall 1992. We only realized that six 
months later when the final figures for the fourth quarter of 
1992 and the first quarter of 1993 were known. 
<H5>  Not In Favor of Social VAT </H5>
  [Alphandery continues] It is clear that the employment 
problem will not automatically be solved with the end of the 
recession. The Giraud law's five-year employment plan clearly 
identified the three key factors on which we must take action. 
First, the lack of flexibility in the job market; the law 
contains several initial responses on this point, like the 
annual calculation of working hours or the services voucher. 
Second, the lack of professional qualification. Hence the 
training-in-the-job contracts [contrats d'insertion]. Finally, 
the efforts to reduce social security contributions on low 
wages: 10 billion francs [Fr] have been allocated to that in 
the 1994 budget. 
  We must just take care to ensure that the remedies do not 
have contraindications which would be likely to cancel out their 
positive effects. Would not an increase in VAT to finance new 
reductions in social security contributions now reduce 
consumption, the rate of which we must, instead, sustain? That 
is why I am not campaigning for a social VAT. 
  [Robin] The government's economic policy was primarily 
aimed at restoring a balance to the public accounts. You wanted 
to restore confidence in the French people worried at seeing the 
deficits threatening their social security system. This was the 
reason for increasing the CSG [general social contribution]. 
Does the result live up to your expectations? 
  [Alphandery] I think so; we obviously first had to reassure 
the French people about the future of their social security. As 
for the increase in the CSG, by helping to restore credibility 
to our economic policy, it made it easier to reduce interest 
rates. This resulted in savings of Fr60 billion for the 
enterprises and Fr15 billion for the state. What would have 
happened without that? 
  [Robin] Some economists are accusing the government of 
emphasizing a policy of supply to overcome the crisis, whereas 
it is demand which is lacking. Francois Mitterrand has taken up 
this idea, referring to the Fr80 billion given to the 
enterprises without any effects on employment. What is your 
answer? 
  [Alphandery] It is true that we have made a considerable 
effort, especially with regard to the small- and medium-sized 
enterprises, through the reimbursement of VAT. In so doing we 
have been able to avoid additional bankruptcies, as is shown by 
the trend recorded in the last months of 1993 when the number of 
bankruptcies fell. At the same time, we took several important 
measures to help households; families not liable for tax 
received a higher grant for the beginning of the new school 
year, and income tax has been reduced by Fr19 billion. 
  The balance between supporting demand and strengthening 
supply seems satisfactory, because we must prepare the ground 
for a healthy recovery. 
  [Robin] On another front, you have been accused of pursuing 
a monetary policy which does not correspond to the internal 
requirements of the French economy which would have justified a 
larger cut in interest rates, or even a devaluation of the 
franc. Do you think the debate is finally over? 
  [Alphandery] The interest rate cut made over the past nine 
months is impressive. France is now among the countries with 
the lowest rates in Europe. This is particularly true for 
long-term rates of between 2 and 10 years with which the 
enterprises and the state can finance themselves for a rate of 
less than 6 percent. With regard to shorter-term rates, the 
reduction in interest rates is continuing, and we are already 
very close to countries like Britain which devalued their 
currencies in the hope of securing lower interest rates. I note 
that those economies have short-term rates of more than 5 
percent, whereas the United States and Japan have been able to 
reduce their interest rates to 3 percent or less. Nobody in 
Europe has managed to do that yet. It is a difficult fact to 
explain but one which affects everybody. 
  [Robin] The deterioration in public deficits has been abrupt 
in France, so much so that those deficits are now relatively 
higher than in Germany, according to OECD estimates. How do you 
explain this phenomenon? Is the French economy, with its very 
high compulsory contributions, impossible to manage in a period 
of recession? 
  [Alphandery] Our predecessors gave us a poisoned chalice 
with public and social security deficits much higher than 
expected. Such deficits are worrying and they must be 
eradicated, which we have started to do at the cost of 
temporarily increasing the compulsory contributions. But, 
ultimately, we must have the aim of reducing the compulsory 
contributions which are an obstacle to the creation of wealth 
and a source of unemployment. Hence the five-year plan to 
reduce the budget deficit which aims essentially to control 
public spending. 
  We should beware of comparisons with our partners. Taking 
all spending into account, the public deficit in France is no 
higher that we are seeing in Germany, in particular.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Installation of the Monetary </F>
Policy Council: Balladur Declares That Central Bank 
Independence Aids Franc's Credibility"] 
  [Text] "An independent Central Bank is still not a deaf and 
blind Central Bank, or an institution which would be oddly 
located outside of the field of democracy," declared Jean-Claude 
Trichet, governor of the Central Bank on Friday, 7 January, on 
the occasion of the installation of the Monetary Policy Council, 
which took place in the presence of Balladur and Alphandery. 
  "The independent central banks in all the other countries 
must, under one form or another, support the general economic 
policy of the country without, of course, prejudicing their 
monetary independence. This is what French law says (...). This 
is also what German law says and, finally, it's what the 
Maastricht Treaty says." 
  "Likewise, communication between the executive power and the 
central bank will be natural," continued Mr. Trichet, alluding 
to the possible participation in council meetings--without 
voting rights--of the prime minister and the minister of 
economy. "In countries which are deeply attached to the 
independence of the central bank, this direct communication 
between the government and the monetary authority occurs 
naturally and bears no prejudice against the independence of the 
monetary institution which alone decides, within the law, that 
is, without receiving or soliciting instructions from anyone." 
  "The independence of the Central Bank permits improvement of 
the efficacy of price stability policy, aids the international 
credibility of our money, and at the same time gives our economy 
the best financial environment possible," declared Balladur 
afterward. "I've always thought that the stability of prices was 
a necessary, if not always a sufficient, condition for durable 
growth. This stability particularly assumes the operation of an 
efficacious monetary policy clearly and explicitly oriented 
towards this objective," he added. 
  "It is credibility which now appears to be the key value, 
the 
condition for success (...). When there is total credibility in 
the Central Bank (...) market rates (...) can progressively 
eliminate (...) risk premiums (...). All countries are gradually 
reaching the same conclusions on the appropriateness of central 
bank independence," the prime minister concluded. 
  After its installation, the Monetary Policy Council, which 
consists of six members, in addition to the Governor of the Bank 
of France and his two vice-governors, held its first meeting, 
devoted to setting the length of each councillor's term. After 
drawing lots, the length of term for Jean Boissonnat and Bruno 
de Maulde was set at three years, that of Denise Flouzat and 
Jean-Pierre Gerard at six years, that of Michel Albert and 
Michel Sapin at nine years. These are not renewable except for 
the three-year terms.

  [Text] Toulouse, France, Jan 17 (AFP) -- The first A330 
Airbus to go into commercial service made its maiden flights on 
Monday [17 January] between Marseille and Paris, and then Paris 
and Toulouse, Air Inter airline officials said. 
  The airliner, flying for Air Inter, offers 412 seats, 30 
percent more than an Airbus A320, with the same fuel 
consumption. The airline officials said that the new model will 
offer productivity gains on the airline's most popular routes in 
France. 
  Air Inter is to receive three A330s by March, and a total of 
five by the end of the year, out of an initial order for 15 put 
in in 1989, at a time when air traffic was growing strongly. 
  The operating problems linked with the depressed conditions 
in the air travel industry have led Air Inter to adjust that 
initial order, so that it will be able to buy planes in the 
Airbus range from the A319 to the A330, depending on commercial 
needs.

  [Editorial Report] In an editorial in the 1-2 January 
left-of-center Paris daily LIBERATION, Gerard Dupuy examines the 
reasons that may have caused the government to release and 
extradite to Iran--rather than Switzerland, which had asked for 
them--the two suspects in the murder of Iranian dissident Kazem 
Rajavi. Perhaps it was in hopes of avoiding Iranian terrorist 
blackmail as the trial in France of former Iranian Prime 
Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar's assassin draws closer, Dupuy 
conjectures. Perhaps it was a way of ingratiating 
fundamentalists the world over, and especially in Algeria, he 
adds. Then again, the government may have been motivated by its 
desire to promote economic relations in an area where France's 
role is "unremarkable." Deploring the government's refusal to 
comment, Dupuy expresses the hope that, on the contrary, much 
will be said, it being "at least strange" that a government that 
includes "professional terrorist eaters" such as Interior 
Minister Charles Pasqua would show Tehran a kindness "whose 
laxism borders on cynicism." The "national interest" invoked by 
Paris entails a minimum of political morality, and hence 
transparency, Dupuy concludes.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] According to Philippe Reinhard's article 
in the 3 January Paris center-right daily LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS, 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's most delicate task for 1994 
will be dealing with Jacques Chirac, leader of Balladur's own 
party, the Rally for the Republic (RPR), in a probable race for 
the succession to President Francois Mitterrand in 1995. In the 
"inevitable" struggle that will ensue, Chirac enjoys two 
important advantages, says Reinhard. He can count on a devoted 
political apparatus and, unlike a Balladur busy with day-to-day 
problems and bound by his own promise to postpone the opening of 
the presidential debate, he enjoys greater freedom of movement. 
For his part, Balladur does not lack trump cards, Reinhard 
continues. The prime minister is already considered a candidate 
by a number of political personalities of the parliamentary 
majority and enjoys popular support, as indicated in a series of 
polls. However, the outcome of a race is undecided, Reinhard 
points out. Both men must take into account those who prefer to 
wait--like Minister of Foreign Affairs Alain Juppe--and those 
"lurking in the background," such as Union for French Democracy 
(UDF) leader Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who hopes that a 
Chirac-Balladur confrontation will open a "window of 
opportunity" for himself.

Article   Type:CSO 

  [Editorial Report] Considering that the idea of abandoning 
the former Yugoslavia and removing UN forces stationed there is 
now openly debated, this first important test of a Europe on its 
way to unity is proof of "inconsistency," Gerard Dupuy 
editorializes in the 7 January left-of-center Paris daily 
LIBERATION. A "last and ironic example" of this is the appeal 
for help to President Clinton and the Americans by France, the 
European government most favorable to an active policy in the 
former Yugoslavia. This is a clever way to "pass the buck," 
Dupuy comments, since Paris is well aware that the Americans 
have no intention of picking it up, after their experience of 
"warring without making war" in Somalia quickly led them to 
"look for the exit." This is also why the only choice left for 
Europeans is to continue "the make-believe task of doing 
something" while letting their soldiers be ridiculed, perform 
"humanitarian" tasks that may well, in the end, turn against the 
civilian populations themselves, and wait for fires to die down 
while praying they do not start again in the neighbor's 
apartment," Dupuy concludes.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with General Luis Alonso Discua </F>
Elvir, Armed Forces commander in chief, by Raul Valladares in 
Tegucigalpa on 11 January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Valladares] What is your opinion on the 
report issued by National Human Rights Commissioner Leo 
Valladares Lanza? 
  [Discua] I think it is incomplete. He said it is a 
preliminary report, and it does not mention criminal actions 
that occurred at the time -- kidnappings, sabotage, bank 
robberies, murders. I want to mention this because many people 
were kidnapped and killed in the course of Police operations. 
Consequently, I believe there are widows and orphans who also 
have the right to be taken into consideration by the human 
rights commissioner. 
  [Valladares] Do you remember the names of the kidnapped 
persons? 
  [Discua] I remember the names of people who were the subject 
of extortion. I apologize to the honorable people I will mention 
here. They were published by the press, so I can mention them. 
Everything I will mention was published by the press at the 
time. I repeat, there is nothing in the Armed Forces files in 
connection with the missing persons problem. 
  I can mention Dr. [Paul] Vinelli, who was released after a 
ransom was paid. I do not know the amount because it was never 
mentioned but it was certainly reported by the press. Mr. 
[first name not given] Casanova. When he was released, some 
Police members died [five-second break in reception]. 
  [Valladares] Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez appointed you 
commander of the 3-16 Battalion in 1984. Majors Oscar Rene 
Barahona and Vicente Rafael Canales were your subalterns. Tell 
me something about the 3-16 Battalion. What was the objective 
when it was created? 
  [Discua] Look, it is not a squad, it is a combat 
intelligence battalion. If Gen. Alvarez Martinez made the 
appointment, I was not summoned until 15 January that same year. 
At the time I was, first of all, a member of the Army staff. I 
assumed the responsibility of that post on 1 January, excuse me, 
on 1 February 1984, and the unit was organized. The unit did 
not exist prior to 1984. 
  I was entrusted with the mission of organizing the combat 
intelligence unity, the objective of which was to carry out 
intelligence missions in support of the three infantry brigades 
that existed at the time. They were the 110th, 105th, and 
101st. If you add all three numbers you get 316. The brigade's 
mission was to provide combat information and intelligence in 
support of these three brigades, which at that time could have 
become involved in a war at any moment. 
  That is when I was assigned to this brigade. I left the 
country to seek advice from U.S. Army Intelligence, and I 
visited several intelligence units. I visited the Combat 
Intelligence School -- I want to clarify this to avoid any 
misunderstanding. I then drafted a bill, which I have with me, 
that clearly defined the unit's mission. I left that unit 
exactly at the end of March. On 6 April, I was appointed to the 
100th Infantry Battalion. 
  [Valladares] How long did you head the 3-16? 
  [Discua] As I said, I was assigned to it for two months, but 
I spent very little time there because....[pauses] If you check 
the immigration records, you can see that I spent most of the 
time in the United States or in other places seeing how this 
combat intelligence support unit should be formed. 
  [Valladares] Leo Valladares' report alleges that this 
squadron kidnapped, tortured, and killed several Hondurans 
during the eighties. What orders did you issue when you 
occupied the post? Do you really think this battalion had 
nothing to do with what is said, or did it turn bad? 
  [Discua] I can only vouch for the time that I was in charge. 
After 6 April I was assigned to the 5th Battalion, then the 9th 
Infantry Battalion, and from there to the chief of staff of the 
Public Security Force, where I was stationed for only two 
months. From there I was assigned to the 2d Infantry Battalion. 
I cannot answer for the rest of the time because immediately 
afterward I became totally detached from it. This can be 
proved...[pauses] the same documents that were presented... 
  [Valladares, interrupting] You didn't issue any orders? 
  [Discua] At no time. I am a good Catholic, therefore I do 
not do what I do not want done unto me. I never issued such an 
order to any person under my command. My problem was how to 
organize it, and I presented a draft bill. 
  [Valladares] General, the people are closely following this 
interview on HRN. You never issued orders to arrest anyone? 
  [Discua] Never. 
  [Valladares] Do you believe military members who were part 
of 
the 3-16 Battalion should be investigated? 
  [Discua] I want to say that the intelligence battalion was 
dismantled by an agreement in 1987. In other words...[pauses] 
I have the agreement here with me. It is Agreement 21-92 of 
the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, who at the time was 
Gen. Humberto Regalado. The agreement says to deactivate the 
Logistic Support Command, the Communications Corps, and the 3-16 
Intelligence Battalion. It says to activate from 1 September 
1987 the 1st Communications Battalion and the Army Logistic 
Support Battalion. It is clear here. You can see it here. 
  [Valladares] General, what can you say about the request 
made by Cofadeh [Comittee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in 
Honduras]? 
  [Discua] Well, what can I say? Every Honduran citizen 
definitely has the right to resort to every legal resource 
available. If there is going to be justice in this country, it 
is first necessary for the report on that period to be 
completed. That report is incomplete. I call on all those 
widows, people who were tortured, and orphans who have not 
appeared before the human rights commissioner to do so, because 
I think it is necessary to complete the report. Because if ... 
  [Valladares, interrupting] Is the report incomplete? 
  [Discua] It is totally incomplete. By 1991 an amnesty had 
been declared, and several of the people who reentered the 
country affirmed that they had participated in kidnappings, 
holdups, and deaths as well as the murder of Gen. [first name 
indistinct] Martinez. Those statements were broadcast and 
printed by the media for everyone to see. Back then they were 
common crimes because they were criminal acts, yet the amnesty 
protected those people. They were never put on trial because 
they took advantage of the amnesty. The presidency of the 
Republic and the Armed Forces ratified and supported the 
amnesty, which gave ample protection to everyone who 
participated in criminal acts. 
  [Valladares] Congress has approved three amnesties in the 
past decade. Should those three amnesties also include the 
military? 
  [Discua] We should carefully analyze the law in this 
respect. 
I do not have a copy of the amnesty that was declared during 
that period. However, I would like to say that the last 
amnesty, Decree No. 87-91, which appeared in the official 
gazette, reads: To provide wide and unconditional amnesty to 
all persons sentenced, indicted, or subject to arraignment in 
any court of the Republic charged with political, common, or 
related crimes included in Chapter 12 to 9, both incorporated 
into crimes against the security, interest of the state, penal 
code, and so forth. Further on it says: Chapter 1 of the 
military code related to political crimes committed prior to the 
effective date of the present decree; in other words, the 
amnesty is blanket and unconditional since many people benefited 
at the time. Those persons were in one way or another involved 
in kidnappings, deaths, and murders during that period. 
  [Valladares] General, what can you say to the Honduran 
people about reports indicating that you could be called to 
testify in court? 
  [Discua] I can say sincerely that I feel at peace. If I did 
not meet with the media at an earlier date, it was because I do 
not like to discuss certain issues in public. I respect the 
media a great deal. Threats have been made against me through 
the media, and some serious words have been used against me. 
  [Valladares] Personally, how do you feel? 
  [Discus] Personally, I feel at peace. I am a bit annoyed 
because I think that sometimes people make decisions based on 
emotions, resentment, and hatred. I understand their pain. I 
think we should respect each other. I do not insult people nor 
do I try to do it because that is not my style. I repeat: I 
respect all human beings because that is how I was raised. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Valladares] I have two final questions. Do you feel 
completely innocent in the case of the missing people? Yes or 
no. 
  [Discua] Yes, definitely. 
  [Valladares] How do you view the support the Superior 
Council 
of the Armed Forces has given you? 
  [Discua] The Superior Council has been informed of all these 
events because I visit all the units, one by one, and I issue 
reports. I do not ignore the fact that I have adversaries in 
the institution. Remember that I am head of the institution. I 
am the shield of the institution. I represent the institution. 
Therefore, I am the target of all sorts of attacks. I, Luis 
Alonso Discua, am at the head at this moment, but it could have 
been somebody else. That other person would be facing the same 
situation, because right now there is an Army reduction policy 
in effect. Situations are being sought out to justify the 
elimination of some institutions. 
  But remember, we are independent. We have our own national 
identity. The Armed Forces have the fundamental mission of 
safeguarding this country's democratic system. This is first, 
and we will always struggle for a legal state and for respect 
for everybody's rights. 
  [Valladares] What message do you have for the Honduran 
people, who are listening to you because as you have said, they 
had been waiting for you to make this type of statement? 
  [Discua] First, I want to apologize to the Honduran people 
for not having addressed the situation before; not out of fear, 
no. I did it because I do not like confrontations, I do not 
like to speculate. I represent a very serious institution and I 
respect other people's suffering. I respect all people, 
especially the ladies who at one time or another have referred 
to me in a very nasty way. I respect their opinion. I accept 
their pain, but I believe that people should not be prejudged, 
that accusers should resort to the services to which all 
citizens are entitled.

  [Text] [Paraguayan] President Juan Carlos Wasmosy arrived 
in Buenos Aires this morning. He will probably propose an 
association of Southern Cone governments, in what could be 
called the resurgence of the "Condor Operation," to fight 
eventual subversive outbursts similar to that provoked by the 
Zapatist movement in Chiapas, Mexico. 
  Argentine media sources commented on a meeting between 
[Argentine President] Carlos Menem, [Uruguayan President] Luis 
Alberto Lacalle, and Wasmosy in Punta del Este last weekend, 
during which the presidents reportedly expressed concern for the 
possible entry, through the Bolivian and Paraguayan borders, of 
alleged guerrillas who would attempt to destabilize local 
governments. 
  Asked about the subject shortly before leaving for Buenos 
Aires, Wasmosy denied that the issue had been discussed during 
the Punta del Este meeting. He said, however, that the matter 
could possibly be raised this time around, adding that if this 
were the case he would propose the association of the three 
countries' armies and intelligence services. Asked about his 
government's proposal if the issue of guerrilla activities were 
discussed at the mini-summit, Wasmosy said: "An association. 
Let us hope all countries will join efforts -- armies as well 
-- to fight drug trafficking, money laundering, and crime in 
general. That is the objective. We had a meeting of general 
staff chiefs to discuss the matter recently. I think we have 
made progress."

  [Text] Bridgetown, Barbados, 15 Jan, CANA -- Caribbean 
Community (Caricom) secretary-general, Edwin Carrington, says 
1994 will be "a critical year" for the 13-nation economic group 
because of challenges presented by the new General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA). 
  The new GATT, concluded last month after seven years of 
tough 
bargaining under the so-called Uruguay Round, will govern 
international trade into the next century. NAFTA, on the other 
hand, is expected to shape future trading relations among 
countries of the western hemisphere, including Caricom's 13 
members. 
  "Our priorities in the region must take into account these 
important developments," Carrington told CANA during a visit 
here this week. If Caricom is not "effectively strengthened" to 
deal with these changes, he warned, the region will face the 
prospect of marginalization in the world Community. 
  "Unless Caricom is effectively strengthened, it cannot take 
an effective part or play an effective role, or protect itself 
effectively or take advantage of the opportunities, withstand 
the challenges or deal with the challenges that will emerge from 
these international developments," Carrington said. 
  As the first priority for this new year, he said, Caricom 
should move speedily to establish the proposed single market and 
economy. The second priority was deciding how the region will 
deal with NAFTA which took effect on January 1 and links the 
United States, Canada, and Mexico in a free-trade zone. NAFTA, a 
United States idea, envisages the eventual creation of a 
free-trade zone embracing all democratic and free 
market-oriented countries in the hemisphere. 
  Carrington said NAFTA was an important issue for Caricom 
countries because the bulk of their trade and investment 
relations are with North America, in particular the United 
States. He indicated the United States was setting tough 
conditions for considering a Caricom request that some key 
regional exports, including garments, sugar, and petroleum, be 
granted temporary parity with mexico in terms of access to the 
U.S. market. 
  Because these Caricom exports do not enjoy duty free access 
to the U.S. under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), Caricom 
producers fear they will lose out to Mexican competitors in 
these areas because Mexico has an advantage under NAFTA. If its 
request for same treatment as Mexico is granted, Caricom hopes 
to use the period -- three years is the time proposed -- to make 
necessary adjustments and to negotiate participation in NAFTA if 
it decides to go that route. 
  ".... The U.S. is saying ...Before we can give consideration 
to the question of parity, we would like to know how you stand 
on intellectual property rights, ... What are your conditions of 
worker rights, what is the status of democracy and good 
government, what is the CET (Caricom's Common External Tariff) 
going to be on critical products like rice, what about 
investment guarantees for our investors in your countries, 
...What is your macroeconomic framework and policy?" 
  "All these they are demanding just to talk about the 
question 
of parity, which is a temporary limited concession, before we 
get to the next stage of the question of full NAFTA membership 
if we so decide," Carrington told CANA. 
  The Caricom secretary-general said Caricom's approach to 
NAFTA is linked to the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), 
expected to be established in July. Membership will be open to 
all countries within and bordering the Caribbean Sea, including 
some Central American states. 
  "...Those countries of Central America which are covered by 
the Caribbean Basin Initiative face exactly the same challenge 
like we face with respect to NAFTA," Carrington said. "What are 
trying to do right now is ... Design a machinery to work 
jointly with them. We agreed in principle so to do, but the 
machinery for doing is now being established." 
  The Caricom secretariat plans later this year to mount a 
number of seminars dealing with NAFTA and the new GATT for 
various regional sectors.

  [Text] Colonia, 17 Jan (EFE) -- A series of differences 
were revealed on 17 January in the first results of a meeting 
the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, and 
Uruguay held to give political support to the Parana and 
Paraguay Rivers "waterway." 
  Carlos Menem, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, Itamar Franco, Luis 
Alberto Lacalle -- the presidents of Argentina, Paraguay, 
Brazil, and Uruguay -- are in Colonia, 180 km from Montevideo, 
attending the fifth Common Market of the South [Mercosur] 
summit, whose agenda centers around resolution of discrepancies 
for implementation of a common market. 
  Bolivia, which is not a Mercosur member, is being 
represented 
by its president, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who is attending as 
an observer. This country has been considered part of the River 
Plate Basin in the "waterway" project, which will give Bolivia 
its longed- for access to the sea. 
  Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu told journalists 
that 
"the waterway will be included as a topic in the final 
declaration" of the fifth summit, which will end this evening, 
but did not report on the project's difficulties. 
  The common channels that Argentina and Uruguay -- the two 
River Plate coastal nations -- have under the terms of the River 
Plate Treaty have been used so far to reach the sea from the 
Paraguay and Parana Rivers. 
  But an Argentine initiative to build a private channel 
within 
its territorial waters through a public works concession to a 
private party, a project that will be financed through tolls, 
has created displeasure among the system's partners. 
  Uruguay has conveyed to Argentina its concern over the Mitre 
channel, which is the name of the Menem government's 
privatization project. 
  This channel will join the Argentine port of Rosario on the 
Parana River with the Atlantic Ocean. This will eliminate the 
Uruguayan port of Nueva Palmira as the river's final port, where 
Paraguay and Bolivia have been allowed to operate duty-free 
warehouses. 
  Uruguay also is concerned that the deepening of the new 
channel in Argentine territory will displace the channel the two 
countries share in Martin Garcia. 
  River navigation experts also have voiced their concern 
about 
the Mitre channel, which could force Uruguayan ships to pay 
tolls to the enterprises awarded the construction of Argentine 
public works, even for navigation to Uruguayan ports on the 
Uruguay River.

  [Text] Colonia, 17 Jan (NA) -- President Carlos Menem today 
criticized the region's businessmen and said "there are 
companies" in Mercosur [Common Market of the South] member 
countries "that, safeguarded by an internal growth policy, were 
protected more than necessary." 
  "They lost their spirit of initiative and market 
sensitivity, 
which should be their essence, so competing in a broader market 
is a difficult challenge for them," the Argentine president said. 
  Menem's statements were interpreted as a reply to the 
demands 
made by some industrial groups in the region, especially the 
Argentine Industrial Union (UIA), which repeatedly has requested 
the postponement of the deadlines to establish Mercosur. 
  The Argentine president, however, said his government "is 
clearly concerned with this situation because behind each 
company there are capital and jobs of people whom we cannot 
forget." 
  Menem made these statements during the official opening 
ceremony of the fifth Mercosur Council meeting that is being 
attended by the presidents of Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, and 
Bolivia in the El Mirador Hotel convention hall. Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada attended the meeting as a 
special guest since his country is not a Mercosur member. ? 
With Mercosur, Menem said: "We have begun to change the 
continent's history and I would even say that we have taken a 
qualitative step toward our maturity as a nation." 
  "Interrelation has become so important that currently not 
even the major world powers can avoid political, economic, and 
cultural associations with other countries. The European Union 
and NAFTA are eloquent evidence of this." 
  He said: "The economic benefits our four countries currently 
are obtaining through Mercosur are evident," adding that one of 
the most evident accomplishments has been the increase of trade 
in the region. 
  When referring to the troublesome subject of common import 
duties, the Argentine chief of state praised the fact that the 
member countries have so far agreed on a considerable amount of 
items, although he recognized that "there is still much to be 
done." 
  "In 1994 we must make a renewed effort to improve the basic 
instruments that will guarantee fluid trade in Mercosur as a 
free trade zone and as a customs union," Menem said. 
  In turn, Brazilian President Itamar Franco said efforts in 
the past three years to establish Mercosur "were greatly 
compensated for by the positive results already attained." 
  Franco agreed with Menem that in 1994 the member countries 
will go through a decisive stage because they must define a 
common import duty to consolidate the integration process.

  [Text] During the fifth Common Market of the South 
[Mercosur] summit in Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, President 
Itamar Franco stressed that this year Mercosur will have to 
define a foreign tariff and the common trade policy that will be 
pursued. 
  Sitting next to the presidents of Argentina, Uruguay, and 
Paraguay, the Brazilian president emphasized that Mercosur's 
success will be closely linked to the customs unification on 1 
January 1995. 
  President Itamar Franco stressed that the Brazilian 
Government is determined to comply with all the commitments made 
in order to implement the economic and social goals defined in 
the Asuncion Treaty. 
  In his speech, President Itamar Franco emphasized that 
Brazil 
does not assign an exclusive priority to Mercosur and confirmed 
his favorable stance for enhancement and joint efforts toward 
integration with the Andean Group and Amazon Initiative 
countries. 
  In his speech, the Brazilian president said the Mercosur 
countries are paying attention to today's reality involving the 
establishment of NAFTA, an organization economically uniting the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada. 
  President Itamar Franco emphasized the democratic maturity 
of 
Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay as a factor required 
for the success of South America's integration.

  [Text] Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (EFE) -- 
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, speaking about 
Latin American integration today, said: "We have failed and we 
must recognize it in our lack of political willingness to 
eliminate borders because they exist more in the minds of our 
countries' leaders than in geography." 
  Sanchez de Lozada spoke before his Argentine, Brazilian, 
Paraguayan, and Uruguayan counterparts to thank them for the 
invitation to participate as an observer in the fifth Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South] summit. The Bolivian president 
said: "Our peoples have always considered themselves brothers 
and members of a greater Latin American family. In this process 
of advancing behind an ideal, we have fallen and risen many 
times, but we are learning." 
  "The new international reality has a dizzying dynamism. The 
EC is practically a reality. There are new and powerful 
economies in Asia and the Chinese giant seems to be awakening," 
Sanchez de Lozada said. 
  "With our past experiences and the demands of the world 
today 
we, Latin Americans, are taking the challenge of integration 
more seriously, and Mercosur is proof of that," Sanchez added. 
  "We, Bolivians, are convinced that undertakings such as 
Mercosur, the Andean Pact, or the Group of Three have the common 
objective of advancing behind a larger and broader sub-regional 
integration ideal, which will be followed by a regional and then 
a continental integration process," the Bolivian president said. 
  "We congratulate ourselves for the implementation of NAFTA 
not only because it represents an important step forward in the 
economic relations of friendly countries, but also because 
Mexico's participation establishes new and promising terms for 
our intercontinental economic and trade relations." 
  Sanchez stressed: "We must direct all our integration energy 
toward convergence and direct all our bilateral and subregional 
efforts toward a regional economic area." 
  The Bolivian president said this integration must be based 
on 
three basic pillars: free trade with productive investment, 
international equality, and social well-being "because the 
economy must serve man and not simply the statistics." 
  Sanchez de Lozada said: "Bolivia has a role in this process 
of articulation and contact. We are ready to play our role in 
American integration. We have a deep belief in integration and 
we will play our role in the River Plate area, or the Andean, 
Amazon, Pacific, or Atlantic regions." 
  Sanchez de Lozada concluded by saying: "Bolivia is a 
privileged country in the Latin American region because of its 
geographical position, its clarity, the continuity of its 
economic policy, and, above all, because of its unfailing 
integrative political will."

<F P=106> [Report by Lastenia Murillo Munoz and Jose Otero] </F>
  [Text] Jaime Abad, director of the Judicial Technical 
Police (PTJ), said yesterday that the institution he heads is 
legally and constitutionally empowered to seize weapons from 
U.S. citizens outside of their working hours. 
  "Regardless of whether (the weapon) is a high-caliber 
weapon, 
civilians are prohibited from having high-caliber weapons in 
residences," the official said. 
  Oswaldo Fernandez, director of the National Police, charged 
on 12 January it is "illegal" for U.S. soldiers or any citizen 
to have high-caliber weapons in their homes. 
  The PTJ director expressed concern in the wake of the 
killing 
and suicide that took place at the Campo Lindbergh housing area 
on 8 January where a U.S. soldier shot and killed his wife with 
a rifle and later committed suicide by shooting himself in the 
head. 
  Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino said that if he gets a 
formal request from the police director, he will speak with 
Ambassador Deane Hinton to request that the Southern Command 
issue regulations to its troops on the possession of weapons. 
  The PTJ chief explained that once a weapon is seized and an 
individual is detained, he is then subject to proceedings 
according to the Canal Treaties. The liaison agents are then 
contacted. 
  Quincleiton Mora, division chief of the Arms Permit Division 
of the PTJ, said it is completely illegal for U.S. military 
personnel based in Panama to carry firearms outside their 
respective work stations. 
  The PTJ official explained that the existing regulation on 
the issue of firearms prohibits foreign military personnel from 
carrying high-caliber weapons outside their work stations. 
  Mora said his office is not granting arms permits to U.S. 
soldiers in the country and "especially not if it involves 
weapons that can cause much destruction." 
  Mora said that during the electoral period the sale, 
exportation, and issue of firearms will be suspended to avert 
dangerous situations.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibeth Vega G. and Orlando Mendieta C.] </F>
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara announced yesterday the 
appointment of National Police Director Oswaldo Fernandez as new 
Supreme Court justice, replacing former Supreme Court President 
Carlos Lucas Lopez. Endara made the announcement during an 
improvised news conference at his private office at the 
Presidency of the Republic. 
  According to Endara, Fernandez has the requisite experience 
to make a positive contribution to the administration of 
justice. Fernandez, who is the current National Police director, 
replaces Lopez, who resigned due to "strictly personal reasons" 
on 3 January. Lopez said at the time he would remain in the 
Supreme Court as long as his work as Civil Court magistrate 
required it and until his replacement was appointed. 
  "Fernandez is a great lawyer who has won the Panamanian 
people's trust," Endara stated. The president added that he was 
confident Fernandez' appointment as Supreme Court justice would 
be ratified by the Legislative Assembly in March, given the 
official does not belong to any political party. Fernandez is a 
lawyer and has already occupied the positions of Superior Court 
magistrate in Penonome and as circuit judge. 
  Regarding Fernandez' replacement as National Police 
director, 
Endara said he has no person in mind for the position but that 
he believed the new police director should be a "civilian." The 
president added: "This is a problem I have to resolve as 
president. I have to find a person to direct the police, and I 
believe the position has to be filled by a civilian. At least 
during my government, I want that person to be a civilian who is 
apolitical. I have not found the person yet, however." The chief 
executive asked the media to propose names for the position of 
police director, "because I do not have anyone now." 
  For his part, Supreme Court President Arturo Hoyos has said 
he agrees with Fernandez' appointment to replace Lopez. Hoyos 
added that legal institutions should be headed by people who are 
not linked to political organizations. The official made those 
statements when he answered reporters' questions on the 
situation in several judicial organizations. Although he chose 
not to refer directly to the situation at the Attorney General's 
Office, Hoyos said: "Precisely, my election to the presidency of 
the Supreme Court shows the magistrates desire the Judicial 
Branch to be headed by a person who has no ties to any political 
party." 
  "This is our stand on the issue," Hoyos stated when he was 
asked about the possibility of finding a solution to the 
situation that is negatively affecting the Attorney General's 
Office. The Supreme Court president added that, evidently, the 
Attorney General's Office and the Judicial Branch have to have 
the people's understanding to be able to work expeditiously. 
  Regarding other topics, President Endara spoke sparingly 
when 
he commented on the current political situation. He denied, 
however, that the 12 January cabinet meeting had been cancelled 
due to the electoral negotiations between the Arnulfist Party 
and Molirena [Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement.] Endara 
said that the meeting had been canceled because all the issues 
in the agenda had been covered, "and as we are all busy, I did 
not think it was necessary to call the cabinet to a meeting."

  During its convention today, Civic Renewal nominated Ruben 
Dario Carles as its presidential candidate. The ticket will 
include Dr. Gloria Moreno de Lopez as first vice president and 
Dr. Tomas Herrera as second vice president. 
  The convention, which began this morning, was suspended for 
an hour, because convention delegates could not agree on two 
vice presidents. Civic Renewal insisted that its president, 
Tomas Herrera, should be the first vice president; it was 
explained later that Carles himself chose his running mates. 
  Tomas Herrera accepted the nomination for second vice 
president and asked the delegates to support him, citing the 
need for unity against the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] 
ticket. With Herrera's acceptance, Civic Renewal approved the 
presidential ticket in an open vote. After the results were 
disclosed, former political adversaries Ruben Dario Carles and 
Gloria Moreno de Lopez arrived at the convention together. 
  [Begin Carles recording] Following 21 years of dictatorship, 
we have not yet rid ourselves of the bad habits and corruption 
imposed on our country by the military, which is now attempting 
to return. [end recording] 
  After Civic Renewal nominated him as presidential candidate, 
former comptroller Carles went to the Morena convention at the 
Atlapa Convention Center. Amid shouts of: Carles for President, 
Morena's convention delegates unanimously supported Carles' 
presidential candidacy with Gloria Moreno de Lopez as first vice 
president and Tomas Herrera as second vice president. 
  The 76 convention delegates agreed to form an alliance with 
Civic Renewal and open negotiations with other parties. During 
his speech, Carles said that over the past few weeks he has 
focused on preparing his political platform. 
  [Begin Carles recording, in progress] ...while others 
elbowed, punched, and kneed each other [applause] to win a 
nomination and others cast unjustified insults at people who 
were entitled to civic nominations, I have traveled throughout 
the countryside to update the information I had. [end recording] 
  The government platform of the Carles-Moreno de 
Lopez-Herrera 
ticket broaches such issues as the improvement of public 
services, the Canal's operation, and how the reverted areas will 
be used. 
  Meanwhile, Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican 
Movement] 
elected today its convention delegates throughout the country. 
The 1,040 elected delegates will decide the course the party 
will take in the forthcoming May elections. In most of the 
provinces the delegates were elected by sole consensus lists, 
except in the city of Santiago, where there are two lists, and 
Colon Province, where the delegate positions were disputed by 
factions split between Jaime Ford and Legislator Alonso 
Fernandez. 
  The Molirena elections, which went normally, were attended 
by 
20 percent of party members. Molirena's convention is scheduled 
for 23 January, when the delegates will decide whether to 
nominate Ruben Dario Carles or Guillermo Ford.

  [Text] Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, president of the Arnulfist 
Party [PA], has said three political parties have confirmed they 
will join the PA in the coming elections, while President 
Guillermo Endara has said he was "seriously assessing" his 
government's situation after negotiations were broken off with 
Molirena [Nationalist Republican Liberal Movement]. 
  Moscoso de Gruber has said the Authentic Liberal Party 
(PLA), 
the Independent Democratic Union (UDI), and the Popular Alliance 
[AP] have confirmed they will join forces with the PA in the 
coming elections; nevertheless, according to a ruling issued 
last night by the Electoral Tribunal, the AP cannot participate 
in the coming elections. 
  Moscoso de Gruber added that the Popular Nationalist Party 
will decide in the coming hours if it will participate in this 
alliance, while the Nationalist Unity Mission will decide on 
this issue during the weekend. 
  Regarding Molirena, the political leader has said that if 
this party will remember that the PA must lead the presidential 
ticket, negotiations can be resumed. 
  According to the latest Electoral Tribunal statistics, the 
PA 
has 130,000 registered members. Meanwhile, its allies, the PLA 
and the UDI, have 27,000 and 24,000 registered members 
respectively. 
  The opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party has 180,000 
registered voters, and its possible allies--the Labor Party and 
Liberal Republican Party--have 80,000 and 30,000 registered 
voters respectively. 
  Meanwhile, President Endara has told EL PANAMA AMERICA that 
he will decide on the state of his government regarding Molirena 
when his conscious tells him what he must do. 
  "It is a critical situation, because there is no doubt that 
when two parties of my government cannot reach an agreement, 
this can logically have some consequences; nevertheless, as 
president I am removed from partisan interests," he said. 
  Endara reiterated that for the time being he has not made 
any 
decision on the situation of the Molirena members in his 
government. Nevertheless, he said that he will make a decision 
that is best for Panama. 
  Meanwhile, the president has reported that the nation's 
current political situation might prevent his participation in 
the inauguration for new Honduran President Carlos Roberto 
Reina, scheduled for 27 January.

<F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Ernesto Perez Balladares, Democratic Revolutionary 
Party [PRD] presidential candidate, believes Arnulfist Party 
presidential candidate Mireya de Gruber and Ruben Dario Carles 
represent the same groups, and so it is not correct to consider 
them as two independent candidates. Perez Balladares was 
interviewed live during our morning newscast: 
  [Begin recording] [Perez] We foresee a confrontation between 
groups that oppose this government and the government, 
regardless of the government candidate's name. [sentence as 
heard] We believe there is still time to comprise the alliances 
that are necessary to remain in power. We will also, obviously, 
lead the people's opposition proposal against the current 
regime, the government that failed to yield results, the 
government that resulted in frustrations, that we [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Regardless of the government 
candidate's name, meaning Ruben Dario Carlos or Mireya de Gruber? 
  [Perez] Regardless, we think there will be a government 
candidate and our own candidacy. 
  [Reporter] It does not matter if the candidate is Mrs. 
Gruber or Mr. Carles who is reportedly going along those lines? 
  [Perez] That is not the important issue. In any case, I 
think they both represent the government. Former Comptroller 
Carles was a conspicuous member of the current government until 
recently. He now reneges on many of his promises, but we will 
remind him about those promises in due time. Mrs. Gruber is 
president of the Arnulfist Party and, evidently, she seems to be 
its standard-bearer. We believe they are both one in the same. 
  [Reporter] Is the PRD willing to relinquish a vice 
presidency either to the PALA [Labor Party] or the Liberal 
Republican Party, in case an alliance is comprised, particularly 
when the PALA.... [pauses] Dr. Carlos Lopez Guevara said here, 
in a "Telemetro Reports" morning newscast, they will leave if 
they are not given the opportunities they expect. 
  [Perez] I think it is more serious, meaning it is more 
important and worthy for us to present a proposal that is 
capable of implementing our government platform than to go 
around, like some parties are doing, making a show of themselves 
by handing out what they do not even (?have). 
  [Reporter] You specifically mean the ruling parties. 
  [Perez] Of course. I specifically mean them. Consequently, 
I believe our directorate board, which shall meet quite soon, 
will be the one to decide the terms and conditions of the 
alliance. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>
  [Text] According to a CELA [Center for Latin American 
Studies] poll, 75.4 percent of Panamanians expressed their 
intention to vote during the next elections. At the same time, 
Ernesto Perez [Balladares], PRD [Revolutionary Democratic Party] 
candidate, continues to lead the national voters preference poll 
with a 13.1 percent margin. 
  The third CELA "Elections 94" poll was conducted throughout 
the country at the end of December 1993, and interviewed 2,681 
persons. Of the population sample interviewed, 75.4 percent 
indicated they would vote during the coming 8 May presidential 
elections, 16 percent were undecided, and 9 percent said they 
would abstain. 
  The results of the poll were made public yesterday during a 
news conference by CELA Secretary Marco Gandasegui who explained 
that the sampling reflects a 3 percent, more or less, margin of 
error. It was also reported that due to technical problems, the 
poll does not include the Provinces of Bocas del Toro, Darien, 
or the San Blas territory. 
  The Electoral Tribunal has indicated that 1.5 million voters 
are eligible to select President Guillermo Endara's successor, 
two vice presidents, 71 legislators, 65 mayors, 510 
corregimiento representatives, and several council members. 
  CELA pointed out that voters most emphatic about abstaining 
are mostly senior citizens, while the undecided voters are 
mostly lower income groups and those with less education. 
  According to the sample, Ruben Blades, presidential 
candidate 
for the Papa Egoro party follows Perez with 9.3 percent; 
followed by Arnulfist Party [PA] candidate Mireya Gruber with 
5.3 percent; Guillermo Ford of the Molirena [Nationalist Liberal 
Republican Movement] Party, 3.9 percent; former Comptroller 
General Ruben Carles, 3.5 percent; and Ricardo Arias Calderon of 
the PDC [Christian Democratic Party] with 3.1 percent. 
  In the metropolitan area of Panama City, Perez also leads 
voters preference with 13.4 percent, followed by Blades and 
former Comptroller General Carles. At the same time, Gruber and 
Arias Calderon improved in comparison with the last poll. Mrs. 
Gruber recorded 4.4 percent and Arias Calderon recorded 3.6 
percent in the metropolitan area. 
  In Cocle, Veraguas, Los Santos, Chiriqui, parts of Panama 
and 
Colon, Gruber came in second with 6.5 percent, Blades was third 
with 5.8 percent, while Perez headed voters preference with 12.7 
percent.

<F P=106> [Report by Emilio Sinclair] </F>
  [Text] Opposing political persecution and proclaiming acts 
of reconciliation for the nation's well-being, Ernesto Perez 
Balladares, presidential candidate of the opposition Democratic 
Revolutionary Party [PRD], has reiterated to the National 
Council of Private Enterprise (Conep) that he will not rearm the 
remnants of the defunct Defense Forces, known as the National 
Police. 
  Perez Balladares has admitted that insecurity is among the 
social ills that have flooded the country, and he said it is 
necessary to train the Public Force so that it can fulfill its 
duty, but he dismissed the possibility of reactivating 
militarism. 
  The PRD candidate made these statements to leaders of Conep, 
a powerful economic organization 
  Perez has said his government plan does not foster 
competition between the state and private sector, rather, he 
said, it is urgent to improve Panama's labor efficiency so that 
it can be competitive in light of the increased devotion to duty 
perceived in other regional countries. 
  Perez has said that should he win the elections, improving 
national security will be among his priorities. He will 
"provide the country with an efficient police so that all of the 
people of our isthmus will be sure of the protection of their 
lives, personal integrity, reputation, and property..." He also 
spoke of constructing the Panama-Colon Highway, extending the 
Arraijan-La Chorrera Highway, and extending the David-Paso Canoa 
Highway in Chiriqui Province. 
  During a question and answer period, Dr. Ernesto Perez 
Balladares has said state banks should not compete with private 
banks, adding that the National Savings Bank could be privatized.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Panamanian Human Rights Committee; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Panamanian Human Rights Committee (CPDH) hereby 
addresses the nation and especially canal area employees to 
outline its position concerning the recent assertions made by 
the Panama Canal administrator regarding the political 
participation of canal employees in the upcoming elections in 
May 1994. 
  First, it is worth explaining that the reasons invoked by 
the canal administration to justify the ban on Panama Canal 
employees' participation in the May elections are applicable 
only to U.S. citizens. To attempt to impose them on Panamanians 
is to disregard the basic principles of national sovereignty. 
  Second, Panama's Constitution acknowledges the basic right 
to 
elect others and be elected to public office. A foreign law 
cannot infringe on precepts established in the laws of the 
nation. 
  Third, the canal administrator's assertions are not in 
keeping with international pledges signed by the Republic of 
Panama by way of important human rights pacts and international 
agreements. Article 25 of the International Pact on Civil and 
Political Rights establishes that all citizens will enjoy the 
right to participate in the conduction of public affairs 
directly or through freely elected representatives. 
  Due to all of the above, the CPDH reaffirms the canal area 
employees' inalienable right to participate fully in the 
nation's politics. 
  Panamanian Human Rights Committee 
  [signed] Roberto Troncoso B., president.

  [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 15 Jan, CANA -- Guyana's 
National Assembly has passed a customs amendment bill comprising 
new rates of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) Common External 
Tariff [CET] , being implemented by the community's 12-member 
common market. 
  Guyana is one of three member states -- Antigua and Barbuda, 
and Montserrat are the others -- yet to implement the CET after 
Caricom agreement in 1992 on a lowering of the tariffs to 
reflect international trends. 
  All three opposition parties here supported the government 
as 
the Customs (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 1993 came up for debate and 
passage this week. Debate on the bill was previously scheuled 
for December 16, but was postponed because of delays in printing 
of the voluminous tariff rates. 
  The CET is intended to demarcate a regional market behind a 
common tariff against third-country goods. It is expected to 
facilitate the development of regional manufacturing and 
agriculture.

  [Excerpts] We now have the president's return from the 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] summit in Colonia, 
Uruguay. Jose Rojas is now at Silvio Pettirossi International 
Airport. 
  [Begin live report] [Jose Rojas] Thank you Benito. At this 
precise moment President Juan Carlos Wasmosy now is stepping off 
the plane and is being met by Vice President Angel Roberto 
Seifart, who was acting president while the president was out of 
the country. [passage omitted] 
  We will see if we can reach the place where the president 
will give his news conference. [passage omitted] 
  [Wasmosy] Very well, I believe that before you ask your 
questions it would be better if we inform you of everything. I 
would like to answer your questions, but before I do I would 
like you to listen to the reports of Foreign Minister [Luis 
Maria Ramirez Boettner] and Finance Minister [Crispiniano 
Sandoval] about the meetings that we had, and afterward I will 
answer your questions in case you have any doubts or on anything 
that may not have been clear. 
  [Rojas] We are in direct contact with the studio, and I beg 
your pardon Mr. President, this will be my last question. Were 
you happy with everything that was discussed. 
  [Wasmosy] Well, it was a meeting in which I participated for 
the first time as president and I am an engineer by profession 
and very pragmatic. I made known Paraguay's position in a very 
clear and categorical manner in that if macroeconomic policies 
cannot be coordinated, if there is not agreement and equilibrium 
in the discussions, then we must try and get each country to 
expound its internal problems while trying to understand, with 
solidarity, the problems of the other countries. 
  [Rojas] How was your proposal received? 
  [Wasmosy] Very well. My address was the only one that 
really touched on the key points of that meeting. And I believe 
that during these meetings we must discuss the real problems 
affecting the integration treaty and not just give a lyrical 
address. 
  [Rojas] Is it true that Mercosur's timetable is going to be 
delayed? 
  [Wasmosy] The foreign minister will explain that. 
  [Rojas] We now return to the studio to continue with the 
newscast and we will expand this information in other newscasts. 
Thank you and we return to the studio. [end live report]

<F P=106> [Report by Magnolia Ruiz; from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The gringos that are camped out in Juanchaco have 
certainly brought weapons, reported Tulua Mayor Gustavo Alvarez 
Gardeazabal today. They have enough weaponry to seize half of 
Colombia, he said. 
  [Begin Alvarez recording] The U.S. presence is a presence of 
foreign troops. Those people brought weapons, but Admiral Jose 
Ignacio Rozo [commander of the National Navy Base at Malaga Bay] 
has their weapons stored in a container that is under the 
custody of a Colombian soldier. The admiral is executing strict 
orders based on an agreement, but a foreign Army is undoubtedly 
being lodged at a Colombian naval base; therefore, it was 
necessary to request the Senate's permission. [end recording] 
  The great doubt of why prevails. What is the reason? What 
explanation will be given concerning a large weapons shipment 
under the custody of a Colombian Navy member if they reportedly 
came to cooperate with Colombia and build projects in the zone? 
  [Begin Alvarez recording] I met with a commission from the 
Prosecutor General's Office, which is investigating the case. I 
suppose the same will be done by the commissions being sent this 
week by Valle Department's assembly, Buenaventura's council, the 
Senate of the Republic, and many journalists from different 
media, who will witness how enough weapons to seize half of 
Colombia were transferred to build a small school and a health 
post. [end recording]

  [Text] Bogota, 15 Jan (DPA) -- Several radio stations 
today reported that two airplanes, apparently belonging to the 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), flew over Colombia's 
Caribbean area for several hours. 
  The airplanes began flying at low altitudes over the cities 
of Barranquilla and Cartagena at approximately 0900 (1400 GMT) 
and after noon they were still flying. 
  Up until late afternoon no Colombian authority had reported 
any reasons for the flights, which caused concern among 
residents of these Caribbean cities, which are visited by large 
numbers of tourists. 
  Unofficial sources have informed DPA that within the next 
few 
hours the government of Cesar Gaviria will release an official 
statement explaining the presence of the airplanes in Colombia's 
air space. 
  It seems as if the airplanes are conducting routine flights 
between several bases, within the framework of agreements signed 
between Colombia and the United States to wage war on 
drug-trafficking gangs. 
  This situation has emerged at a time when Colombia is facing 
a huge controversy over the presence of U.S. troops who are 
working on various fronts. 
  The most controversial case has been reported in the western 
town of Juanchaco, where U.S. troops are building a school, 
health center, and highway, to which several political sectors 
are opposed. 
  Detractors say the foreign troops are taking advantage of 
their stay in Colombia to conduct intelligence tasks and other 
unclear activities that violate Colombia's sovereignty. 
  Gaviria's government has insisted that the U.S. aid is legal 
and a noble gesture, because the projects they are carrying out 
are for the benefit of the country's poor sectors.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Arango in Rio Blanco, Tolima Department; </F>
from the "TV Today" newscast] 
  [Text] An operation was executed this week in Rio Blanco, 
southern Tolima Department, presumably with the participation of 
DEA members. Witnesses say six helicopters landed with troops, 
while two small airplanes overflew the zone. 
  The helicopters landed, one by one, and deposited troops in 
the village. Certain residences were later raided. Aircraft 
also overflew the area, and helicopters landed in Gaitan, a 
poppy and guerrilla forces center located two hours from Rio 
Blanco. 
  [Begin Hernando Cardenas recording] It has been confirmed 
that people's money has been seized. It is known that one 
person's 10 million pesos were taken. [end recording] 
  People living in this zone of Tolima Department say the 
country's authorities are doing the right thing when they 
provide protection, but they wonder: Why was such an impressive 
operation launched? Why did the operation include foreign 
personnel? 
  [Begin recording] [Father Ivan Rodriguez] I saw helicopters 
flying overhead. It is true, there were some foreigners. 
  [Jesus Valbuena] The commanders were people who spoke very 
little, and they were heard speaking some words in English. [end 
recording] 
  The residents of Rio Blanco are used to many difficult 
situations, but they are still perplexed by this operation.

<F P=106> [Report by Nelly Gomez in Barranquilla; from the "NTC News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The U.S. airplanes that overflew Barranquilla 
yesterday are participating in narcotics operations with the 
national government's authorization. What is unclear is why 
they flew so close to the ground when their route was authorized 
by the Colombian Air Force at 22,000 feet. 
  The two U.S. military airplanes overflew Barranquilla for 
eight hours and endangered air navigation in Colombia, according 
to Henry Jimenez, supervisor of the Ernesto Cortizos Airport 
control tower. The pilots never reported their position or 
altitude; all they did was identify themselves with the names of 
Cajun 680 Alpha and Cajun 57 Alpha. 
  [Begin Jimenez recording] They never answered our calls, 
which is why they might have caused a collision with controlled 
civilian aircraft. No one could tell what were the aircraft's 
positions or altitude at a given moment. [end recording] 
  According to the official, the U.S. aircraft were in a 
critical airspace coordinate, meaning a route designated for 
civilian aircraft on the Barranquilla-Santa Fe de Bogota-New 
York route, crossing through Curazao and vice versa. 
  The military aircraft left for Howard Air Force Base, 
Panama, 
at 1900.

  [Text] As Caracol network reported one hour ago, a 
Russian-made helicopter crashed shortly after taking off from 
the Tarqui Battalion headquarters in the town of Sogamoso. 
According to the information confirmed by authorities, the 
Tarqui Artillery Battalion commander, a counterinsurgency 
commander with the rank of major, a judge, her secretary, and a 
noncommissioned officer died in the accident. Several people 
were injured, three of whom were taken to San Jose Hospital in 
Sogamoso. The authorities also reported that the three 
helicopter pilots were Russian nationals. One pilot is injured. 
The information Caracol obtained indicates that three of the 
people taken to San Jose Hospital have been released. One of 
them will continue to receive medical attention but is out of 
danger. Here is German Garcia from Sogamoso with more details 
on the incident. 
  [Garcia] Sogamoso medical officials reported that three 
people were injured in the accident that took place at 1250 
today. Three persons are at Sogamoso Hospital and the Social 
Security's Julio Sandoval Medina Clinic. We have invited Dr. 
Fernando Ortiz, who is the emergency ward chief, to tell us 
about the victims' conditions. 
  [Ortiz] We treated two injured persons. One was a civilian. 
The other patient was wearing civilian clothes, but I understand 
that he is a serviceman. 
  [Garcia] Are other injured people being cared for in other 
local clinics? 
  [Ortiz] I have learned that another injured person was taken 
to the Social Security clinic. 
  [Garcia] What are their names? 
  [Ortiz] Excuse me, the Prosecutor's Office asked me not to 
divulge that information. As you can understand, I cannot 
provide those names. 
  [Garcia] Do you know if Tarqui Battalion Commander Ramiro 
Guevara was among those wounded? 
  [Ortiz] I do not think so. The colonel was not one of the 
two patients that were brought to this hospital. I do not know 
if he was the injured person taken to the Social Security clinic. 
  [Garcia] Reports indicate at least nine persons were aboard 
the helicopter. The three injured persons were able to jump 
from the helicopter 200 meters before it crashed. Luckily, 
nobody was in that area. Our sources told Caracol that Artillery 
Tarqui Battalion Commander Ramiro Guevara, two sergeants, two 
captains, one judge, her secretary, and one civilian who has not 
been fully identified were aboard that helicopter. Dr. Fernando 
Ortiz insisted that the Prosecutor's Office is not authorizing 
him to reveal the names of the people who were injured in this 
accident.

<F P=106> [Report by Patricia Uribe; from the "NTC News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Preliminary investigations indicate that excess 
weight caused the Russian-made helicopter accident, in which 
eight people died. 
  The 109th military judge found the aircraft's black box 
recently. The aircraft, a Russian MI-17 helicopter imported to 
Colombia by the Heli-Taxi Company, was rented to the Colombian 
Air Force, which, in turn, turned it over to the Army. 
  [Begin recording] [First unidentified speaker remarks in 
Russian] 
  [Second unidentified speaker] He says it is film like 
photographic camera film, meaning it melts at high temperatures. 
  [Unidentified female judge] Correct. In my opinion, this is 
decided by a technician, an expert on the matter. 
  [First unidentified speaker] Obviously. 
  [Second unidentified] Obviously. 
  [Unidentified female judge] Therefore, no one knows the 
truth for sure right now. [end recording] 
  The helicopter was carrying a prosecutor and a military 
judge 
who were in charge of the investigation in connection with the 
assassination of 14 military members in (Huican), Boyaca 
Department, by guerrilla forces. 
  The 11 occupants were only part of the cargo. Most of the 
weight was in supplies and provisions that were being carried to 
the counterguerrilla battalions camped in the flatlands of 
(Huican), particularly explosives, grenades, and ammunition, 
which exploded in the crash. 
  One of the survivors, Sergeant Martin Francisco Alvarez, who 
is now at the San Jose Hospital in Tunja, has told his wife what 
happened during the last seconds of the fateful flight. 
  [Begin recording] [Esperanza Clarson] The helicopter did not 
crash. It lost altitude and then--I do not know--I believe it 
crashed; that is why he was saved. There was a second door, and 
he escaped through there. He crawled out. 
  [Uribe] What did he do then? 
  [Clarson] He hit the ground, and that was when the 
helicopter exploded. 
  [Unidentified speaker] No, the helicopter did not explode. 
It looked kind of lopsided, like when there are too many 
passengers, meaning excess weight, and it crashed against this 
house. [end recording] 
  The aircraft pilot was retired Air Force Major Jorge Hernan 
Lopera, and Juan Castillo Flores, a Nicaraguan technician, acted 
as copilot. They also managed to survive and are being 
questioned since yesterday in connection with the accident. 
  The two pilots, both the Colombian and the Nicaraguan, are 
employees of the company that owns the aircraft, and they have 
no ties with the Colombian Armed Forces.

  [Excerpt] Santa Fe de Bogota, 17 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Police 
reported today that the Colombian guerrillas kidnapped two U.S. 
citizens who were involved in missionary activities in southern 
Colombia. The missionaries were kidnapped in reprisal for the 
arrival of U.S. soldiers in Colombia. 
  Official sources consulted by NOTIMEX indicated that a group 
of 20 rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC) intercepted the vehicle in which missionaries Steven 
Welch, 41, and Timothy Vandyke, 40, were traveling in southern 
Meta Department. 
  According to the report, the two were kidnapped over the 
weekend on the road from Villavicencio to Restrepo, 200 km from 
this capital. 
  Although the police did not indicate the reason for the 
kidnapping, local unofficial sources said the rebels said it was 
in reprisal for the presence of a U.S. military contingent in 
the Puerto Lopez area, near the site of the kidnapping. [passage

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 13 Jan (EFE) -- 
Police report that some unidentified gunmen shot Colombian 
Liberal politician Jorge Luis Horta, who is running for the 
Senate, in Cartagena de Indias on 13 January. 
  Colonel Hector Mario Castro, police commander in Bolivar 
Department, whose capital is Cartagena, said that the attack 
took place some time after 1200 in the neighborhood of San 
Felipe Castle on Pedro de Heredia Avenue. 
  According to Col. Castro, the attackers, who were on a 
motorcycle, intercepted Horta's vehicle and shot him. However, 
at that moment, a police patrol came along and prevented the 
terrorists from accomplishing their objective, which was 
seemingly to assassinate him. 
  Following a confrontation between the criminals and 
policemen, the criminals fled while the patrol took Horta to the 
Cartagena de Indias University Hospital. Horta was shot in the 
chin, neck, and a hand. 
  Col. Castro stated that the reasons for the attack are 
unknown, and that although Horta remained conscious while he was 
being taken to the hospital, his health condition is critical.

  [Text] Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes was uninjured in a 
bomb attack staged by individuals in an attempt to assassinate 
him. By chance, General Octavio Vargas Silva's car was passing 
by and his driver immediately went to the aid of the finance 
minister and drove him away. The minister has not yet spoken to 
reporters, but we are told that he has just telephoned President 
Cesar Gaviria to inform him of the incidents that occurred this 
morning at 0800. 
  [Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol Network at 1419 GMT on 
17 January adds that the finance minister was traveling 
eastbound in a gray BMW with license plate AH-4772. A bomb 
exploded as the vehicle was about to cross the bridge on 5th 
Avenue. The left part of the car was severely damaged. 
According to reports received by Caracol, the explosive device 
that was planted beside a utility pole contained between five 
and six kg of dynamite. The Santa Fe de Bogota Metropolitan 
Police and Administrative Department of Security experts are 
currently evaluating the situation and are trying to determine 
what type of bomb it was.]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 17 Jan (AFP) -- A spokesperson 
for the Army of National Liberation (ELN) claimed responsibility 
for the failed attack against Rudolf Hommes, minister of finance 
and public credit. The spokesperson made the announcement 
during a phone call to Radio Cadena Nacional studios in 
Medellin, Colombia's second largest city. 
  An explosive charge was detonated as Hommes' vehicle drove 
past, causing damage to the car. The minister was unhurt, but 
one of his escorts was slightly injured. 
  A man who identified himself as a member of the ELN said 
that 
the attack was a consequence of the economic policies that have 
brought poverty and unemployment to the country. 
  Hommes, who is one of President Cesar Gaviria's closest 
supporters, has held his current post since 7 August 1990.

  [Text] Rudolf Hommes, finance and credit minister, escaped 
an attempt on his life unhurt, but one of his bodyguards was 
injured. "National" newscast was the first to arrive at the 
scene. Here is a report by J.J. Pinilla. 
  [Pinilla] The attack took place at 0805 [1305 GMT], when 
Minister Rudolf Hommes was on his usual trip from his home to 
his office in midtown Santa Fe de Bogota. One policeman was 
wounded. The charge, consisting of over 10 kg of ammonal, was 
placed at the base of a lamppost on 26th Street and 5th Avenue 
and detonated by remote control. Following the explosion, the 
minister's driver continued on for another block despite the 
fact that one of the car's tires was flat. They stopped at the 
Santa Monica Hotel, where Hommes Rodriguez left the vehicle and 
was taken to his office in another vehicle. 
  [Begin recording] [Police Colonel Miguel Angel Meza] He was 
taken directly to his office. 
  [Reporter] What happened to the policeman. [Meza not heard 
to 
answer] 
  [Reporter] What route were they taking? Where was the 
minister going? 
  [Meza] He was going to his office. [end recording] 
  [Pinilla] A police bodyguard identified as Libardo Arias was 
injured. A mass transit bus and a private vehicle that were 
passing by were damaged. 
  [Begin recording] [Bus driver Enrique Molano] [Words 
indistinct] just leave me alone. 
  [Reporter] How did you react when the bomb exploded? 
  [Molano] I put on the brakes because the lamppost fell on 
top 
of the bus. That is all I saw. Smoke filled the bus. [end 
recording] 
  [Pinilla] The severity of the attack was lessened thanks to 
the skill of the minister's driver, who never stopped the 
vehicle despite the explosion.

  [Text] The Camilist Union of the Army of National 
Liberation, UC-ELN claimed responsibility for the attack on the 
life of Rudolf Hommes Rodriguez, finance and public credit 
minister, minutes after the explosion was heard. In a telephone 
call, the group added that although they failed this time, they 
will try again. A visibly shaken Minister Hommes spoke to 
reporters after he met with President Cesar Gaviria. 
  Two hours after the attack, the finance and credit 
minister's 
face said it all. As he left the ministry, reporters saw an 
ashen, shaken Hommes never seen before. 
  [Begin recording] [Hommes] I left my house and half a block 
away the bomb exploded. 
  [Reporter] What did you feel at that time? 
  [Hommes] A big bang and lots of smoke. 
  [Reporter] The ELN has just claimed responsibility for the 
attack. It said it opposes the policy of poverty and 
unemployment in the country. 
  [Hommes] I have nothing to say. Pardon me, but this is a 
security risk. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Montenegro [not further identified] said you 
have been receiving threats for a year. 
  [Homes] Pardon me, you understand. There will be a news 
conference later. This is not the place to be giving an 
interview. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Fabio Villegas, government and interior </F>
minister, by Ana Fernanda Valderrama at Narino Palace in Santa 
Fe de Bogota; from the "National" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Valderrama] Here is the first reaction by the 
national government on today's attack on Rudolf Hommes 
Rodriguez, finance and credit minister. Mr. Government and 
Interior Minister Fabio Villegas, has the participation of the 
Army of National Liberation been confirmed? What steps will be 
taken? 
  [Villegas] It has indeed been confirmed that the National 
Guerrilla Coordinating Board [CNG] is at the root of the attack. 
We feel outraged, as all Colombians must feel, over this 
criminal attack, this murderous action by the CNG. The 
government reaffirms its will to maintain its policy of 
eradicating these criminal bands from the country. 
  [Valderrama] A report from the Narino Palace stated that 
Economic Development Minister Luis Alberto Moreno resigned. The 
name of his replacement is being studied here at the Narino 
Palace. What names are being mentioned? 
  [Villegas] [laughs] You have to ask the president.

  [Text] Weapons of the Venezuelan Armed Forces continue to 
fall into the hands of Colombian guerrillas. Here is evidence: 
Troops of the 7th Brigade headquartered in Villavicencio seized 
an FAL assault rifle, the regulation weapon of the Venezuelan 
military, from the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]. 
  The guerrillas repainted the rifle to hide its origin, but 
under the paint an inscription can still be read: Venezuelan 
Armed Forces. 
  There are 80 other rifles like this one in Villavicencio, 
not 
counting the ones seized in other areas of the country. 
  Venezuelan Military Staff members will arrive in Bucaramanga 
on 18 January to request the return of a large number of 
Venezuelan weapons seized from several guerrilla fronts. 
  The official Venezuelan explanation continues to be that the 
weapons were stolen from border garrisons. 
  The Colombian and Venezuelan defense ministers will meet on 
19 January here at the 5th Brigade headquarters in Bucaramanga 
to study the issue of Venezuelan weapons in the hands of 
Colombian guerrillas. 
  In dealing blows to the Colombian guerrillas over the last 
few months, authorities have found Venezuelan assault rifles, 
mortars, ammunition, and submachine guns, all of which bear the 
coat of arms and insignia of the Venezuelan Armed Forces.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 14 Jan (AFP) -- The Colombian 
guerrilla group the Socialist Renewal Movement (CRS), who is 
negotiating with the government on demobilization, agreed to 
surrender its weapons in April, according to an agreement signed 
on Friday and released by the two sides. 
  The CRS, made up of approximately 300 rebels, a dissident 
faction of the rebel Army of National Liberation (ELN), began 
holding talks in December 1993 in Flor del Monte, Sucre 
Department. 
  The negotiating agenda states that the ceremony for 
surrendering weapons and reintegration into democratic life will 
be held on 3 April. The document was signed by Carlos Jaramillo, 
presidential adviser for peace, Deputy Government (Interior) 
Minister Jorge Garcia, and CRS spokesmen Jose Aristizabal, 
Fernando Hernandez, and Alfredo Vivies. 
  The agreement covers social development, economic and social 
reintegration, legal benefits, human rights, citizens' 
participation, concerted economic efforts, and political 
favoring. The last topic makes reference to the rebels' desire 
to participate as a legal political group in the legislative 
elections to be held next March. 
  Aside from the agreement, it was reported that 11 members of 
the rebel group deserted from the camp and took several assault 
rifles and ammunition.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 17 Jan (AFP) -- Police have told 
AFP that an FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) 
guerrilla column consisting of approximately 250 men mercilessly 
occupied Florian, southwest of Santander Department, early 
today. The rebels killed two policemen, wounded a 
noncommissioned officer and another two agents and robbed a bank. 
  In a telephone call to Bucaramanga, the departmental 
capital, 
the police added that the attack was executed by subversives of 
the FARC's 23d Front who destroyed the local garrison but did 
not harm civilians. 
  Florian is located 300 km from Bucaramanga. The town woke up 
in a panic due to bullet noises from the two sides, the police 
command stated, adding that the municipality was already back to 
normal this afternoon. 
  According to the report, there were nine policemen and a 
noncommissioned officer stationed in the town. They responded 
to the rebel fire for six hours until they ran out of ammunition. 
  The guerrillas attacked the garrison with fragmentation 
grenades and mortar fire. After the policemen ran out of 
bullets, the rebels stole their weapons, which included seven 
rifles, two carbines, several revolvers, and three shotguns. 
  Prior to leaving for the mountains of Santander, a farming 
and cattle-breeding region 420 km from Bogota, the guerrillas 
dynamited the local bank's safe-deposit box and took the money 
that was deposited there.

  [Text] The Cali Cartel is as powerful in Peru as it is in 
Colombia. According to intelligence reports, the organization 
operates by bribing the authorities who try to fight them. The 
very few who have dared to report on them are the journalists. 
  Myriam Ortiz brings us a report, done with the cooperation 
of 
Peru's Channel 9: 
  [Begin Ortiz recording] According to authorities, the 
so-called Cali Cartel also has a well-structured organization in 
Peru known as Los Calenos. 
  Waldo Vargas, alias El Ministro, is considered the main 
leader. He purchases drugs worth $144 million every year. 
Vargas, born in Colombia, is the lord and master of the Bajo 
Huallaga area. He has gone as far as using Peruvian Air Force 
helicopters to transport drugs, according to information given 
to the general command. 
  Demetrio Limoniel Chavez, also known as El Vaticano, is the 
other leader of the organization. It is estimated that he buys 
$216 million worth of drugs every year. El Vaticano works with 
his brother Humberto, also known as Calavera, who manages the 
landing strips, but his main storage center is in Palma Pampa, 
Ayacucho, from where the flights leave for Colombia. 
  Berta Chavez, also known as La Calena, is El Vaticano's 
sister, and she markets 5 tons of coca paste each month. She 
was arrested in September 1993, but a judge released her 
recently. 
  (Luis Hernan Pineda Menjura), also known as Trompa de Buque, 
and La Calena were in charge of a shipment landing strip and 
this laboratory uncovered by police. 
  Everything seems to indicate that this cartel's strategy is 
to buy the authorities in charge of fighting drug traffic. For 
this reason, they operate as if they were in their own homes, 
and the cases of corruption become more evident everyday. 
  Major (Enrique Paez), former commander of the Zaposoa Base, 
has admitted he allowed drug flights to come in, while Maj. 
Alfredo Ruiz, former commander of (Duchisa), was caught when he 
was authorizing the shipment of a cargo of coca paste to 
Colombia. 
  The military does not like the journalists' research. Some 
have been murdered; others have received death threats. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Adolfo Salamanca, Colombian National Police </F>
commissioner, by unidentified reporter in Santa Fe de Bogota; 
date not given -- first five paragraphs EL TIEMPO introduction] 
  [Text] The government issued a new disciplinary code--some 
sort of Ten Commandments--for the National Police on 7 January. 
  The objective is to fight corruption. The person responsible 
for implementing this new code is Adolfo Salamanca, the 
country's first National Police commissioner. 
  The commissioner has received EL TIEMPO in his residence and 
spoke clearly. "The police," he said, "is the institution that 
violates human rights most often. I say this based on reports 
from the Attorney General's Office, which in 1991 reported more 
than 1,500 cases of police human rights violations." 
  "This means," he explained, "that errors are being 
committed, 
that the law is being infringed, and that the citizens' rights 
are being passed over, and this must be corrected. I am sure 
that the current police director wants this." 
  According to Salamanca, the police must recover its civilian 
role and end a militarization process that has deformed the 
institution's philosophy. He answered questions in the 
following interview: 
  [EL TIEMPO] How do you view the police high commissioner's 
mission? 
  [Salamanca] The commissioner must contribute to the 
strengthening of reform and coordination efforts to determine, 
evaluate, and prevent problems. 
  The commissioner has to order and supervise the 
investigations against members of the institution and personally 
receive complaints and proposals from the people. 
  [EL TIEMPO] There was strong resistance to the appointment 
of 
a civilian to that post, and some believe that your role there 
will perturb more than one person. 
  [Salamanca] The appointment of a civilian is in line with a 
worldwide trend. As errors, human rights violations, and police 
corruption have become known, there has been a growing trend 
toward citizens securing control and establishing supervision. 
  I believe that to the extent my own limitations allow, I 
will 
be able to contribute unselfishly, along with the Police 
Directorate, to enforce compliance with reform to change the 
institution's image so that the people may believe that police 
work means protection. The police form part of civilian society. 
The police force is civilian. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Have the police forgotten their civilian roots? 
  [Salamanca] I do not believe they have forgotten that. It is 
that as the police they have been assigned multiple functions, 
which are often beyond their own capabilities and mission, and 
as they have been identified as in the same genre of the 
military administration and the military forces, the way of 
acting and the work of police have been deformed. [sentence as 
published] It would be ideal if the police could walk the 
streets without carrying weapons. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What do you mean by "the way of acting and the 
work of the police have been deformed?" 
  [Salamanca] This is what the reports that produced the 
reform 
say. There are vices, such as the participation of some members 
of the institution in efforts to defend private interests. 
  There is also the militaristic approach with which the 
institution has been managed on certain occasions. 
  Also, no one ignores that certain police sectors have become 
independent and that as such they engage in illegal activities. 
This is what an author called the "autonomizing" of certain 
police sectors. 
  It is also evident that the people complain about the 
inefficiency, slowness, lack of opportunities, and lack of 
infrastructure the police must overcome in complying daily with 
elemental missions. 
  The police is also the institution that most often violates 
human rights, according to reports from the Attorney General's 
Office which in 1991 reported more than 1,500 cases of human 
rights violations by the police. 
  There is one additional fact: The largest number of cases 
against the state at the court for suits under administrative 
law arise from police actions. This means that it is evident 
that errors are being committed, the law is being infringed, and 
citizens' rights are being infringed, and this must be 
corrected. I am certain that the current director is interested 
in this happening. We must order and supervise investigations. 
We must report the results to the people. 
  [EL TIEMPO] There are announcements about all types of 
investigations in Colombia. Citizens are skeptical about 
results. What will change now? 
  [Salamanca] The current structures and functioning of 
control 
mechanisms have not been efficient enough to make results known. 
We are committed to making the results known. This situation 
must be corrected. 
  It is no easy task. I am aware of the many difficulties and 
risks that this entails, but we are committed. We are going to 
engage in a pedagogic endeavor, and I am sure we will be heard. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Any risks? 
  [Salamanca] Surely, as interests are affected and the people 
outside the law become afraid of an investigation and penalty, 
and in this, like in any other activity, there will be negative 
reactions, of course.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 17 Jan (DPA) -- Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria appointed today young politician 
Mauricio Cardenas as the new economic development minister, 
Narino Government Palace sources have told DPA. 
  The new minister is the son of Jorge Cardenas, Colombian 
coffee czar, and he currently holds the post of manager of the 
Colombian State Energy Enterprise. 
  This will be his second experience in the public sector, 
because previously he had dedicated himself exclusively to 
managing private sector companies. 
  Cardenas must carry out an industrial reconversion process 
initiated by his predecessor. The process is aimed at boosting 
industry in the face of the economic opening implemented by 
Gaviria's government. 
  The incumbent minister resigned to join the political 
campaign of Conservative candidate Andres Pastrana, who in early 
February will launch officially his presidential campaign.

<F P=106> [News conference by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria with </F>
local reporters and an unidentified moderator at the Narino 
Government Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota--live] 
  [Text] [Gaviria] The finance minister represents the 
Colombia of today and the country's process of modernization. 
Colombia would like to again become a serious country, a 
country that wishes to become internationalized, a country that 
does not want populist politics but wants to modernize. The 
minister became a terrorist target due to what he represents. 
The idea is to intimidate all of those who would like to 
modernize this country. The minister, therefore, represents a 
threat to them, the guerrillas, who are incapable of convincing 
the Colombian people with their laconic language, with their 
message of violence and terrorism. Obviously, they oppose all 
changes in this country; they do not want this country to feel 
sure of itself or leave violence behind. 
  [Moderator] A question by Carlos Ruiz from Caracol while 
Javier Cardenas of Super gets ready. 
  [Ruiz] Mr. President, the American community awaits your 
statement regarding your candidacy to the post of OAS secretary 
general. Will you accept the nomination that certain countries 
have proposed? 
  [Gaviria] I still do not know if I will accept. It is public 
knowledge that several countries, several governments, have 
expressed interest that the Colombian president be nominated to 
the post of OAS secretary general. I am listening to some of 
the arguments and have spoken to numerous heads of state, and 
the foreign minister has made consultations. When we estimate 
that the time is right, we will make a decision, considering not 
Cesar Gaviria's personal interests but the country's interests, 
the nation's interests, and we will see whether the country is 
interested in holding the seat of OAS secretary general. That 
is why public opinion should realize that I would be 
representing the country as a Colombian candidate and not simply 
as my personnel aspiration. 
  [Moderator] The next question is by Javier Cardenas of Radio 
Super while Carlos Ruiz of Caracol gets ready. 
  [Cardenas] Mr. President, what is your reply to the people 
who say that you are negotiating the post of OAS secretary 
general in exchange for allowing the installation of U.S. 
military bases in Colombia? 
  [Gaviria] I believe those affirmations are ridiculous, 
simply 
ridiculous. I understand there can be people who may question 
the presence of advisers or engineer personnel or people who are 
helping to fight drug trafficking in Colombia, and I would be 
willing to reply to such a question. The Colombian president 
does not negotiate the country's position, however. The 
president defends the country's sovereignty, defends the 
country's interests, even though the president can understand 
that in certain cases there can be legitimate doubts and 
concerns. In other cases the president sees certain intentions 
to protect drug-trafficking interests; unfortunately, in these 
comments all sorts of opinions become intermingled. There are 
the concerns of those who legitimately have concerns, worries, 
and doubts, while there are some who may worry that the country 
will continue its antidrug--trafficking struggle. Unfortunately, 
many recent rumors are seemingly promoted by the latter. 
  [Moderator] Next question is by Antonio Jose Caballero of 
RCN 
while Sabina Hernandez from Toledar gets ready. 
  [Caballero] Mr. President, are you willing to reply to the 
other part of the question? Public opinion is listening. Why 
did the gentlemen come to Juanchaco Base? What are their 
specific tasks? Why did U.S. airplanes overfly Barranquilla 
yesterday while people complained--especially after they 
overflew the airport? 
  [Gaviria] With pleasure. You have asked me two questions, 
but I will reply with pleasure, because these are related 
topics. In Colombia there is a U.S. military presence engaged 
in civilian work, advisory work, maintenance work, training of 
Colombian troops, and, on other occasions, their own training. 
Colombia approved a law back in 1947. There are numerous 
agreements, memorandums of understanding, and accords. These 
U.S. military missions have taken place during every 
administration. The specific case of Juanchaco is covered by a 
memorandum of understanding signed by Defense Minister Rafael 
Pardo and the U.S. ambassador for joint engineers corps 
exercises. I would say that the building of a school and 
hospital are subproducts of a joint engineer corps training. 
The same goes for the building of river ports, such as the one 
built in San Jose del Guaviare, another being built in Puerto 
Lopez in El Meta Department, and others that are planned in 
Magangue even though there is still an agreement that these are 
tasks of an engineering corps nature, which are backed by an 
agreement between both governments. 
  Regarding the overflights yesterday, those were duly 
authorized flights that are part of the struggle against drug 
traffickers. The Colombian Air Force has authorized them, which 
is legal. The Civilian Aeronautics Directorate was duly 
notified, and because these airplanes have radars, they report 
to the control towers of the Colombian military base in 
Barranquilla; therefore, as far as the president of the Republic 
knows, everything had been agreed within the procedures. There 
was no violation. These airplanes--which were authorized by the 
Colombian Air Force--did not have to report to the control 
tower, and the Colombian flights were not in danger. 
  That is the information the president has received from the 
Director of Civilian Aeronautics, as well as from the defense 
minister; nevertheless, the Civilian Aeronautics Directorate is 
conducting an investigation and will release some information, 
but the information I have received today from the commander of 
the military forces, acting defense minister, as well as from 
the director of Civilian Aeronautics totally coincides to what 
happened, and, as far as we have been able to verify, those 
flights involved no irregularity. 
  [Moderator] Sabina Hernandez from Todelar Radio poses a 
question, and Azucena Lievano from the "24 Hours" newscast 
prepares her question. 
  [Hernandez] Mr. President, after this morning's attack on 
the 
finance minister, it was reported that other cabinet members, 
other government officials have been threatened. Isn't it 
worrisome that we have these types of violent deeds and threats 
against high-ranking government officials? 
  [Gaviria] Of course, of course it is; and the country must 
know and always remember that in this country there are 
guerrilla groups dedicated to terrorism, that the individuals 
who perform public duties--not just the members of the 
government but other types of public duties, such as journalism 
and other activities, people linked to the private sector--must 
take relatively important security precautions. The government 
is taking many precautions but cannot fully guarantee anyone's 
security. 
  As I already said, these are desperate actions by Colombian 
guerrillas, aimed at trying to show that they still at least 
have the terrorist force, even if their military force has been 
undermined, and statistics clearly show this. They want to show 
that even if the number of kidnappings in Colombia has been 
reduced significantly, that the number of guerrillas in jail has 
grown rapidly, that the number of soldiers killed in combat is 
much less than the numbers of previous years, that even if we 
have so many successes to show in the struggle against drug 
traffic, against the guerrillas and against terrorism, they have 
even more capacity for producing personal attacks such as the 
one against the finance minister. [sentence as heard] 
  [Moderator] Azucena Lievano asks her question, and Diana 
Mateus of the [word indistinct] Radio. 
  [Lievano] Mr. President, Rafael Santos' column in EL TIEMPO 
says that he feels that Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin is looking 
for a seat for the president of the Republic with the nation's 
resources and in the presidential plane, which is touring some 
countries seeking votes for you at the OAS. What is your 
response to this? 
  [Gaviria] I answered that question in part, but I think it 
would be good to broaden the response. 
  This country, as part of its modernization process, must 
also 
modernize its international policy. Countries do not get 
automatic positions at international organizations, rather, 
through the support they get and by presenting their candidacies 
as candidacies of the country. If the country continues to 
adhere to the idea that the aspiration or possibilities of its 
nationals to aspire to organizations of governments, such as 
this one, we would simply never have access to the international 
organizations. [sentence as heard] 
  The other individuals who have nominated themselves for this 
office--and I have not--have the full support of their 
governments. A foreign minister has been campaigning for several 
years, and no one from his country has told him he is 
undermining his country's interests or asked him why he does it. 
The other one is a former foreign minister, and he did so in 
the same manner and he has all the support of the Venezuelan 
Foreign Ministry. 
  These are things that form part of the learning process the 
country has to undergo to overcome its provincialism and to 
understand that for a country it is important to get 
international positions. 
  I believe this country should feel honored, because other 
presidents and other governments believe their president can be 
secretary of the organization of all the American states. What 
the foreign minister is doing is being done for the country; she 
is involved in a consultation process. She has also carried out 
extensive processes to achieve progress in Colombia's 
cooperation with Caribbean nations; that is a process to which 
we have been committed for quite a while. 
  You have seen the president travel to Trinidad and Tobago; 
you have seen the president travel to Jamaica. You have seen 
how the country has tried to amend something that represented a 
critical mistake in our international policy, meaning, turning 
our back on the Caribbean. There are other Caribbean countries 
on the continent--Venezuela, Canada, the United States, 
Mexico--which have an active presence there. 
  Unfortunately, because we have always looked toward the 
Andean mountains and never toward our seas and outside our 
country, we had that attitude of ignoring and turning our back 
on the Caribbean. We have now changed that attitude and are 
looking toward the Caribbean; we are working in the Caribbean. 
  In my opinion, what the foreign minister is doing is useful 
for the nation, and it has been done based on something that 
benefits the country's interests rather than its president. 
  [Moderator] The following question is from Diana Matheus of 
Radio Santa Fe. William Parra of CMI is next. 
  [Matheus] Mr. President, if your nomination to the post of 
OAS secretary general is confirmed, aren't you afraid this might 
provoke political confrontations, particularly with the Costa 
Rican Government, whose president and foreign minister have 
stated this might result if you accept this nomination to the 
OAS post? Also, if you are not elected, will you play the fool, 
as some presidential hopefuls have stated? 
  [Gaviria] First of all, I would like to make something 
clear: 
I have made no decision; you are asking a hypothetical question. 
Second, the Costa Rican president and his foreign minister have 
clearly stated that there could be no confrontation between the 
two countries. It would be a friendly and normal dispute within 
international relations. I believe the country would hurt 
itself greatly if it were to think that the only way to be 
present at an international organization would be by getting 
unanimous votes. A country would do itself a disservice if it 
were to believe that it cannot compete or that if it loses it is 
a national tragedy. No. To be part of the community of nations 
is to understand the rules of democracy. It is to understand 
that one can participate, can present candidates, or can win or 
lose. 
  I am not speaking about my personal case. I am talking about 
any case or any candidate presented by Colombia. Colombia 
cannot tie itself down to the anachronistic idea that if a 
candidate is presented it is due to personal not national 
interests and that a candidate cannot be presented unless there 
is a certainty that he will win. If that certainty is not 
there, what would the international community think? What kind 
of an attitude is this? I think these are very big 
misconceptions about a country's international policy. 
  A country that wants to have a presence in the international 
scenario must be willing to face these contingencies. It must 
present candidates, nominate its nationals, fight for them, and 
abide by the rules of democracy. I am not talking about my 
personal case. I must examine all factors, listen to 
commentaries. I must read what the columnist wrote yesterday or 
the comments made by distinguished presidential hopefuls. 
  You must be certain that I will assess them, but this does 
not mean that the country should cling to such anachronistic 
ideas, ideas that are very foreign to the country's interests. 
  I think that to refuse to have an international presence, to 
fail to participate in international organizations, and to feel 
that it is indecorous to compete is very bad for a country. 
  [Moderator] William Parra will ask the next question. Pablo 
Mantino of Colprensa will prepare his question. 
  [Parra] Mr. President, there are certain analysts who are 
saying that the attack on the finance minister is a way of 
reminding the government of the guerrilla presence or a way of 
pressuring the government into a dialogue. Your government has 
favored the policy of repression. The doors to dialogue have 
been closed for the time being. To what extent will your 
government be willing to implement again the peace policy? To 
what extent will we be on the verge of witnessing elections that 
will again be violent, elections with attacks on the candidates, 
not by drug traffickers this time but by guerrillas? 
  [Gaviria] The Colombian president--this president--has never 
shut the door to political solutions. I believe in them, and I 
think that they will bring peace to this country some time in 
the future. The guerrillas can be certain of one thing, 
however: The government's policy will not change as long as 
there are terrorist attacks and bombs. On the contrary, this is 
convincing us further of the need to insist on our policy of 
strengthening intelligence and the public force, insisting on 
creating counterinsurgency battalions and mobile brigades, and 
strengthening our justice. This is all attacks like this 
produce. Another thing they produce is the nation's 
indignation, the people's rejection of guerrillas. I am certain 
that there is not a single good citizen--good citizens are the 
majority of the people in Colombia--in this country who does not 
reject an attack like the one this morning. If the guerrillas 
think they are going to change this nation through attacks, they 
are very wrong. All they are doing is isolating themselves 
further. 
  [Moderator] The following question is by Fabio Pantino, 
followed by Maria Claudia Pena of LA PRENSA. 
  [Pantino] Mr. President, the Socialist Renewal Movement has 
warned that the Antikidnapping Law is a legal stumbling block to 
any agreement with the government. What can the government do 
to dispel any apprehension by the Socialist Renewal Movement? 
  [Gaviria] My answer is that that is a discussion we must 
hold 
at the negotiating table with the Socialist Renewal Movement. 
Sooner or later we will come to a point where we must hold a 
discussion on that issue; we will have to find a solution at the 
negotiating table. The position of the government, the 
government negotiator, the peace adviser, and the government 
minister is that-- as cited by the Congress of the 
Republic--kidnapping will not be a [word indistinct]. We have 
to hold discussions with the movement at the negotiating table, 
and I would not like to draw conclusions on what the 
negotiations would be like, nor am I at liberty to interpret the 
movement's position. Nevertheless, the government's position 
has been that one, and that position is supported by the 
president of the Republic. The antikidnapping law cannot be set 
aside during discussions with the Socialist Renewal Movement. 
  [Moderator] The following question is by Maria Claudia Pena 
and will be followed by Hugo Barter from Univision. 
  [Pena] Mr. President, in case you do decide to run for the 
post of OAS secretary general and in case you are elected, would 
you be willing to resign as president? 
  [Gaviria] I would like to say that I have not thought about 
that. Hypothetically, if I were to run and win, I would expect 
the position to be compatible with the conclusion of my 
presidential term. If I do decide to run, those within the OAS 
organization in charge of making decisions will have to remember 
that my presidential term ends on 7 August 1994. In this 
respect, I would have to request congressional permission to 
travel, and I am sure there would be no problems. 
  [Moderator] It is now Hugo Bartlet's turn, followed by Ana 
Fernanda Valderrama from the "National" newscast. 
  [Bartlet] Mr. President, during this last stage of your 
administration, what will be the objective--militarily 
speaking--if at this time the guerrillas have become public 
enemy number one concerning terrorism? 
  [Gaviria] We do not plan to change our policy toward the 
guerrillas due to what took place. The guerrillas have been 
conducting terrorism for a long time. Maybe they have not 
conducted any terrorist attacks such as the one against Minister 
Hommes for some time. Their activities within the urban area 
were mostly restricted to explosions and some bus burnings. 
This attack makes it more unusual, however, and places the 
guerrillas in a more recalcitrant position than what they had 
previously adopted. They have now resorted not only to 
terrorist attacks but to selective attacks. 
  Somehow this will serve to remind the country how the 
guerrillas really think. The guerrillas believe that the 
process of more democracy and modernization can tolerate violent 
acts. This attack gives us a picture of the real nature of the 
Colombian guerrilla movement, how it thinks, how cruel it is, 
how merciless it is, and how its back is completely turned to 
what national reality really is. That is what it has shown us 
today. This stresses that the policy we have followed so far is 
the most appropriate. 
  [Moderator] Ana Fernanda Valderrama, followed by Fancisco 
Celis of EL TIEMPO. 
  [Valderrama] Good afternoon, Mr. President. The Colombian 
Government has not hesitated on numerous occasions to forward 
protest notes to other countries due to abuses against 
Colombians in other countries. Concerning Venezuela there have 
been numerous reports of abuses along the border, however, and 
abuses against Colombian prisoners in that country. There was a 
report recently related to a helicopter that crashed in 
Colombian territory. Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin traveled to 
Venezuela, and just when everyone was expecting a protest note 
it never came. Why does the Colombian Government hesitate so 
much when it comes to this case? 
  [Gaviria] Relations between Colombia and Venezuela are 
excellent. President-elect Rafael Caldera has also said the 
same thing. There will be more and more incidents as our 
economic and political relations continue to grow. We cannot 
respond to every incident through protest notes unless it is 
absolutely necessary. 
  The Venezuelan authorities--their foreign minister, defense 
minister, president, attorney general-- have all heard our 
versions of the facts, our report. They have offered to 
investigate them and have undertaken their own investigation. 
We trust that those responsible will be punished if our version 
of the facts turns out to be true, as I think it is. We have 
the duty, however, of having a constructive relationship with a 
nation whose relations are good, with whom we have a common 
destiny, and we are not undermining our sovereignty or the 
rights of Colombians by not sending a protest note every time 
there is an incident. 
  We also have to remember that over there they also have 
problems, that there are Colombian guerrillas who kidnap stock 
breeders and Venezuelan citizens, that there are Colombians who 
are linked to drug-trafficking networks and that they have been 
extending their drug-trafficking activities to that country, 
that there are Colombians who have links to the robbery of 
vehicles. 
  What if Venezuela did the same thing to Colombia? That for 
every incident or every kidnapping, or every such situation, 
every stolen car, they sent a protest note? No. The two 
nations cannot work this way. These are two sister nations that 
have excellent relations. What we try to exhibit is if there is 
comprehension and understanding in a relationship, things can be 
talked out; they are discussed, analyzed; commitments are made. 
If for every incident we sent a protest note, we would not be 
helping the relationship between the two nations. Therefore, 
the foreign minister--after talking to the defense minister, the 
attorney general, the president of the Republic, and the 
president-elect--decided that a protest note was unnecessary 
and, thus, did not deliver it. 
  [Moderator] Francisco Veliz asks his question, and Jairo 
Gomez of the "Seven O'clock Newscast" prepares his. 
  [Veliz] Mr. President, the country will receive important 
revenue from the sale of the Bank of Colombia and the absorption 
of the cellular telephone system. What will happen with those 
funds? To what field will it be assigned? 
  [Gaviria] Concerning the funds from the Bank of Colombia, 
there are resources that belong to the Guarantees Fund, which is 
the institution that backs all the financial system in case of 
problems, and there are resources that belong to the nation; 
they are ordinary government resources that must be used in 
public projects once they are integrated into the national 
budget. 
  Concerning the resources of the cellular telephone system, 
most of them are assigned to the social telephone system, but, 
of course, the government and Congress together could designate 
how they will be used. 
  Those are two processes that are using totally open 
mechanisms and which, once completed, concerning the Bank of 
Colombia, it will be sold after finding the best bidder. 
Concerning the cellular telephone system, it will be given to 
that enterprise that offers the most resources to the Colombian 
state to help in the fulfillment of social objectives [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Moderator] Next question by Jairo Gomez of the "Seven 
O'Clock Newscast," followed by (Giles Gastowait). 
  [Gomez] Mr. President, what makes you the best candidate for 
the OAS secretary general, the support of the United States and 
Canada? 
  [Gaviria] I am not the one who should say I am the best 
candidate. I evaluate the expressions and opinions of other 
countries and governments. Some of them are public; they come 
from countries of South America, North America, and it is 
obvious that to participate in the process, there will have to 
be support from the Caribbean and Central America; otherwise it 
would be very difficult to be OAS secretary general. I am 
evaluating all of those opinions. 
  It has been the governments of certain friendly countries 
that have issued certain opinions regarding the Colombian 
president. I am not the person who should make that statement. 
Certain foreign governments, through their spokesmen, have made 
those statements. 
  I think the most common reason is that certain countries 
want a former Latin American president for secretary general. 
They have many reasons to believe the OAS must move in that 
direction. There are others who have [one-second break in 
reception] of the modernization processes in Colombia, 
commitments with certain economic policies. There is something 
I would like all those present here to remember: Look at 
Colombia's voting record at the OAS or the United Nations or at 
any other international organization. I ask you to judge 
whether Colombia's international policy is independent. 
  If there is one thing this administration has done, it is to 
implement an international policy that is completely 
independent. The criticism we have received is generally due to 
just that--the independence we have exhibited and the autonomy 
of this nation. But also for that reason we have found the 
support of countries that have attitudes that are quite 
different. There have been many occasions when the U.S. State 
Department did not agree with Brazil or Mexico on Latin American 
problems or world issues, but that did not prevent them from 
agreeing on this occasion. 
  We have a long tradition of independence in matters of 
international policy. If the president of Colombia can find some 
kind of support, it must be based on that record--its tradition 
of having a very independent international policy. Therefore, 
all those suspicions that have been emerging will not affect the 
truth, the way Colombia votes at international organizations. 
The way Colombia votes is the way the president of Colombia 
thinks. Those little insinuations that have been made over the 
past few days cannot undermine our international policy, because 
our foreign policy is there and is evident in treaties, 
decisions, public statements, and votes at international 
organizations. 
  [Moderator] Guiles Casuay will ask a question. Cesar 
Mauricio Velasquez will prepare for the last question. 
  [Casuay] Good afternoon, Mr. President. EL TIEMPO published 
yesterday an article saying that the Presidency was worried 
about the progress of the talks for the surrender of the Cali 
Cartel bosses; is that true? How do you view the [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Gaviria] We have our own views about the policy of turning 
over to justice those who are linked with the cartels, the 
cartels of Valle del Cauca, the Coast, or so many 
drug-trafficking organizations existing in Colombia. 
  Each has its own responsibility. The prosecuting offices 
have their own scope of responsibilities. They are clearly 
prescribed in the Penal Code. The Penal Code establishes its 
duties and responsibilities. 
  The government has other responsibilities, such as security 
at jails, [words indistinct] decisions on how long should an 
inmate stay in this or that jail. The government is very 
committed to the policy of [word indistinct] justice. 
  It must be understood that for the government to give 
certain 
guarantees, people should confess their crimes; that must be 
their cooperation with justice. Of course, the individual must 
go to a high-security jail if it is a dangerous criminal. 
  On certain occasions we have had arguments with other 
organizations, the Attorney General's Office, or the prosecuting 
office. I am quite certain, however, that only by listening to 
other points of view can we design a policy that will respond to 
the country's interests. The guarantees that the government 
could eventually give should only be given in exchange for an 
effective cooperation that will serve to punish criminals, 
dismantle the drug cartels, and maintain an active attitude in 
the face of the drug-trafficking problem and a consistent policy 
that is the only thing that can make us overcome this problem. 
  Unfortunately, if one ignores the problem or does like the 
ostrich hiding its head, ignoring the problem or allowing 
criminal organizations to grow in the face of our indifference 
[words indistinct] Colombia in the past and its effects were 
disastrous. 
  I believe it is much more positive to follow a policy of 
being firm and clear, not ignoring drug-trafficking cartels, 
facing and fighting them. The operations by our public force 
and our justice are also positive. An essential part of this 
policy is the [word indistinct] of the surrender policy. The 
criminals, cornered by the action of the public force, will 
surrender to authorities, confess their crimes, and undergo a 
just trial. They will be given guarantees, and this will help 
us dismantle the criminal drug- trafficking organizations. 
  [Moderator] Cesar Mauricio Velasquez will ask the last 
question. 
  [Velasquez] Mr. President, certain politicians have said 
they 
cannot reach more than 170 municipalities in the country to 
conduct their political campaign. Don't you think the event 
that occurred this morning plus the fact that certain 
territories are off limits to politicians and even the Armed 
Forces are part of the pressure exerted by the guerrilla groups 
to resume negotiations with your government and the next? 
  [Gaviria] I understand very well it is risky to participate 
in politics in Colombia. I have experienced this and know what 
kind of difficulties and risks politicians must face. 
Fortunately, our political leaders defy those risks and 
challenges, and they travel to the 170 municipalities and.... 
[pauses] They are not 170, there could be more, much more. 
  The guerrilla groups have some kind of presence, whatever it 
may be, in 500 municipalities all over Colombia, practically 
half of Colombia's municipalities. Our political leaders defy 
that. They have always defied this, and they go there and take 
risks and get elected, and the political groups that somehow 
supported the guerrilla movement are noticeably rejected. They 
practically have no political presence whatsoever, because the 
people reject them. 
  Just as it has happened on so many occasions, I am sure the 
political leaders of this nation will face those risks, defeat 
violent groups, and let no one intimidate them despite the 
evident acts of guerrilla violence. Mayors have been killed; 
that is why we will resort to the Public Order Law to appoint 
military mayors, because we cannot continue to play the 
guerrilla groups' game. They kill mayors and society remains 
defenseless and simply replaces them with other mayors so they 
can kill them also, or so they can force the mayors to give in 
to their demands. No! 
  The public order law certified by the Attorney General's 
Office states clearly that mayors are being killed by guerrilla 
groups. There is clear evidence in this concern. We will have 
to resort to that instrument. We will use it in a Boyaca 
Department municipality and in a Casanare Department 
municipality. 
  We are determined to protect political leaders so that we 
may 
be able to state they face no risks. We hope.... [pauses] We 
are sure that will be the case, meaning, our leaders will face 
those risks. We will prove to the violent groups in our nation 
that our democracy and those who represent it, with the peoples' 
support, are more powerful then their dirty and violent weapons 
and their message of violence and hate.
