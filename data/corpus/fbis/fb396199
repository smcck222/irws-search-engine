  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian economic developments monitored by Panama 
Bureau through 17 January; source follows in parentheses after 
each item. 
  The Treasury is easily losing nearly 1 trillion pesos in 
uncollected taxes per year due to contraband, which represents a 
little more than 25 percent of the country's total annual 
imports. Cigarettes are the leading contraband product. (Santa 
Fe de Bogota EL NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 6 Jan 94 pp 1, 17) 
  Colombian exports increased only by 2 percent from January 
to 
September 1993, totaling $5.269 billion. A huge reduction in 
the export of coffee, oil, fuels, and other traditional products 
are to blame for the poor showing. A 13.5-percent increase in 
nontraditional exports saved the situation, keeping the export 
percentages from falling into the negative side. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 7 Jan 94 p 2b) 
  Colombia and the UK have made significant progress in 
negotiating an investment agreement. Foreign Minister Noemi 
Sanin has said she hopes the negotiations will conclude in two 
months; in addition, the Colombian foreign minister has signed a 
technical cooperation agreement to modernize the state. 
According to the agreement, the UK will contribute 130,000 
pounds and Colombia will contribute 144 million pesos to a 
program that seeks to improve management in government 
institutions. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 12 Jan 94 
p 7a) 
  The manufacturing industry grew by 5.69 percent from January 
to October 1993, according to the National Administrative 
Department of Statistics. The production of transportation 
equipment and material increased by 49.5 percent. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 12 Jan 94 p 6b)

  [Text] The economic outlook for Colombian industry is 
improving. Business reports are favorable in terms of production 
activity, volume of orders, and inventory. 
  This is the picture drawn by the October opinion poll of 
employers conducted by the Education and Development Foundation 
(FEDESARROLLO). 
  In the survey of 360 enterprises in all areas of national 
production, emphasis was placed on the performance of exporters. 
  Despite the increase in the volume of goods shipped abroad, 
33 percent of the firms reported that profits had dipped. 
  This phenomenon is related to the revaluation of the rate of 
exchange because while exporting larger volumes of goods, 
business owners receive less for their sales. 
  Other negative factors for the export sector include the 
high 
cost of labor and domestic transport. The lack of an adequate 
infrastructure in terms of roads, ports, and airports hurts the 
ability of Colombian produdcts to penetrate foreign markets. 
<H5>  Cheap Credit </H5>
  However, there are also positive factors that have helped 
exports. The increase in the volume of foreign sales is the 
result of the lowering of trade barriers by purchaser countries. 
One example is trade with Venezuela, a country which, thanks to 
the free trade agreement, has become the main buyer of our 
products after the United States. 
  Another factor that has benefited not only exporters but all 
business owners is more favorable terms for obtaining credit 
from the financial system due to the lower interest rates 
charged. 
  In fact, interest on loans has held steady at an average 35 
percent annually, down from the 48-percent annual rate charged 
two years ago. Access to cheap credit gives businessmen a 
breather because they can now develop production at a lower 
financial cost. 
<H5>  Industry </H5>
  Some 41 percent of the industrialists surveyed said the 
current economic situation is good, while 46 percent said it is 
acceptable, and 13 said it is poor. 
  For 33 percent of those interviewed, economic prospects for 
the next six months are favorable, while 59 percent think they 
will remain the same. 
  Only 9 percent said prospects will get worse. One of the 
reasons for the optimism of businessmen is apparently related to 
the fact that the government and monetary officials achieved 
their economic goals. They are sticking to the goal of a 
22-percent increase in the cost of living and economic growth 
exceeding 4 percent. 
  Some 23 percent of those polled said the volume of orders 
had 
increased, while 55 percent reported that it had remained the 
same. 
  By sector, the economic situation was good for food, 
beverages, the print and publishing industry, earthenware, tile, 
chemical substances, rubber products, and electrical equipment 
and material. Cement and construction materials have shot up 
because of a boom in the sector. 
  The tobacco industry is depressed and all those polled said 
their current economic situation is negative. Textiles is 
another sector that continues to experience problems. 
  For the commercial sector, the economic situation in October 
was favorable, but less favorable than for industry. Some 32 
percent of those polled said it was positive, while for 58 
percent it was stable. 
  Nevertheless, prospects for the next six months look better 
for the commercial sector, which has been aided by the economic 
liberalization process and integration agreements.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Health Juan Luis </F>
Londono by Gilda Sarmiento; place and date not given] 
  [Text] When the bang of the gavel marked final 
congressional passage of the Social Security reform bill, Health 
Minister Juan Luis Londono leaped in the air to show he was 
"happy as hell with life." 
  And this was no small achievement; the law culminates a year 
of work and provides for a reform that will, in his opinion, 
revolutionize a service that has been in the doldrums. It will 
also realize a constitutional dream of universality, solidarity, 
and efficiency. 
  Others, in contrast, believe it will pull the plug on health 
care. They say it is an immature effort at privatization with an 
excessively complicated and unintelligible text, in which each 
article is two pages long. 
  What no one doubts is that if the goal of giving every 
Colombian--including the 10 million who live in extreme poverty 
today--a whole package of health services is achieved over the 
next seven years, a veritable social revolution will have 
occurred. 
  To achieve this objective, health contributions in 1994 will 
rise from 7 percent to 12 percent, and of those funds, 1 percent 
will be earmarked for subsidizing the poorest of the population. 
  With a view to expanding coverage, 374 billion pesos in new 
resources is guaranteed in next year's budget, a social tax on 
weapons has been created, and beginning in 1997, 15 percent of 
the tax on Cusiana oilfield revenues will go to subsidize poor 
people's health care. 
  In addition, the budget for social investment in health will 
increase each year as a percentage of GDP. 
  It is true that such resources have never been allocated in 
the history of health care, but to leap from that to the notion 
that by the year 2000 there will be no difference between rich 
and poor would seem to be a revolution on paper, a mere utopia 
in the mind of Minister Juan Luis Londono, who defended the plan 
in an interview granted to EL ESPECTADOR. The striking thing 
about Colombia, he maintained, is that it spends less than it 
should on health care, but it is totally surprising that 
coverage under the system is so low. It is barely higher than 
that of Haiti and Bolivia. And ironically, when serious 
projections are made of how much good it would do to eliminate 
poverty, one of the principal difficulties is pessimism. This 
attitude is deeply rooted among intellectuals, who are very 
disparaging about the possibilities of social policy. "We have a 
discourse that attempts to persuade us that nothing ever changes 
in this country, and since nothing ever changes, it is not worth 
making an effort, because what the hell is social policy for?" 
  [Sarmiento] What is the real purpose of health care reform? 
  [Londono] The general purpose is to provide health care for 
all Colombians, because that is the main thing they lack today. 
Some 10 to 12 million Colombians have no health care, but there 
are 25 million who do not have Social Security. 
  [Sarmiento] But Colombia is too poor a country to guarantee 
health care for everyone from one year to the next. 
  [Londono] It is not from one year to the next. It is a 
gradual program. That is one of the obsessions people have had, 
thinking that overnight you can produce miracles. I call it the 
totoya theory: todo para todos ya 
[everything for everyone right now], which is a fundamentalist 
vision shared by some segments of society that are so desperate 
they have lost touch with reality. We have designed a plan so 
that over a period of 8 to 10 years, people will have that 
access. Why 8 to 10 years? Because that is how long it has taken 
in the most successful countries in the world: Costa Rica and 
Korea, which began their reform with per capita income figures 
not far from those of Colombia. 
  [Sarmiento] Where will the money come from? 
  [Londono] This is not just rhetoric. In the 1994 budget, the 
fiscal allocation, which is the contribution the nation makes to 
the departments in relation to what is allotted for health care, 
will rise by more than 50 percent. Not only will the departments 
receive more money, so will the municipalities. Altogether, they 
will receive 60 to 65 percent more. In addition, the Social 
Investment Fund (FIS) has been created, spending on the 
Colombian Family Welfare Institute (ICBF) will increase 
considerably, and the National Health System will receive 400 
billion pesos in net new resources. Part of these funds will 
come from the 100 billion pesos derived from the reform of 
Social Security, which basically will come from the provision 
that all Colombians will pay to give the poor access to health 
care; that provision represents about 50 billion pesos, and the 
government and the municipalities will contribute a similar 
amount. If we combine them, that makes 400 billion pesos in new 
money for health care, something unprecedented in this country. 
  [Sarmiento] What was the greatest obstacle in the debate on 
the bill? 
  [Londono] The program basically was attacked from two 
flanks, 
by those who long for a single public monopoly, and by those who 
accuse us of being privatizers. The interesting thing in 
Colombia is that we have managed to create our own model, and it 
is a lie that we are privatizing. What are we going to do? 
Define a single health care plan that will be equal for everyone 
and that will gradually converge, because there is not enough 
money for totoya, and if people want to have it all, 
we have lost the battle at the outset. 
  [Sarmiento] What can a poor man and his family expect 
beginning in 1994? 
  [Londono] We cannot create false hopes. The reform will not 
give health care to the entire population as of 1 January next 
year. It is a program that requires the construction of a 
system: On the one hand, we must get the money; 400 billion 
pesos is a lot of money, and we need much more. What can they 
expect? We are generating a program so that the poorest people 
in the country and the families of those who have the ability to 
pay will move closer together right away, and in the not too 
distant future--eight years--they can be equals in a 
comprehensive plan, like the one that Social Security Institute 
(ISS) beneficiaries have today. 
  The reform will take full effect in May, so the principal 
goal, in terms of equity, is to give access to the system to a 
million poor families, the most downtrodden in the country, 
through subsidies in keeping with demand. We have 150 billion 
pesos that will enable us to reach a million families, to whom 
we will provide a health care plan amounting to 150,000 pesos 
per family per year. The rich people in this country may think 
that a pittance, but you have to understand that the poorest 10 
percent of this country have annual family incomes of 600,000 
pesos, and we are going to give that group a raise equivalent to 
25 percent. 
  [Sarmiento] What guarantee is there that this reform will 
not 
become paralyzed under the new government? 
  [Londono] The reform has two advantages: It is very good, 
and 
it has been the product of a great effort at coordination. 
  [Sarmiento] Many think that you are excessively optimistic, 
and that the program is really not that good, that it was 
debated less than the pension program. 
  [Londono] They have the wrong impression. The problem is, 
pensions have sparked much more interest in the private sector 
and have drawn much more press coverage. Since the program I 
proposed was for the poor, a lot of people said what the heck, 
that does not matter to me, and there was this idea that it was 
not very important. Meanwhile, a process of consensus was 
created. I spent a year, during which 70 percent of my time was 
devoted to meeting with people. There has been an incredible 
degree of consensus; the problem is that I do not reach such 
consensuses in the press. 
  [Sarmiento] There are those who say that the next few years 
will be spent reforming the reform. 
  [Londono] I would hope that this process would have the same 
dynamic as the economic liberalization, which was very 
controversial three years ago, the focus of a lot of fear. Many 
groups pinned their hopes on reversing the liberalization 
process, and today they see that it is irreversible, that it has 
had some undeniable benefits, and that it may need some small 
adjustments. 
  [Sarmiento] Do you think this reform is ambitious, but it is 
a revolution on paper? 
  [Londono] No. I think that what makes the program 
interesting, and very different from other reforms that have 
been launched in the past, is that it has two conditions of 
viability: first, financial viability, because it is not 
demagogic; and secondly, political viability, in the sense that 
it is not a reform imposed by technical experts, but the product 
of a very broad democratic consensus. And in spite of 
everything, it is a very technical reform; it is consistent and 
comprehensively articulated.

<F P=106> [Commentary by D'Artagnan: "Mischievous Luis Alberto"] </F>
  [Text] It is difficult to find anyone who generates more 
admiring comments than Luis Alberto Moreno, not just because of 
his professional competency, but mainly because of his human 
qualities. 
  As a friend, Moreno is one of those persons who will go to 
any lengths when he sees that someone close to him is having a 
hard time of it or is faced with some problem. I am in a 
position to say this because I have been a beneficiary of his 
advice and generosity, because his family and mine are joined by 
old bonds of friendship, and because, independently of his 
intelligence--and that thing they call creative genius, which in 
his case is a perfect definition of his way of being and of 
bonding--he is, in essence, what Machado called a man, in the 
best sense of the word. Such is the well-deserved fame that 
Moreno enjoys with nearly everyone. 
  Furthermore, his intimate relationship with Andres Pastrana 
is unconcealable. It is a relationship that presumably began 
when the two were teenagers, but which undoubtedly grew stronger 
when they began to work together, first as journalists, then on 
"TV Today," with Andres as the announcer and director and Luis 
Alberto the manager, a successful team effort. We later saw that 
Moreno's cooperation was vital to Pastrana's candidacy for mayor 
of Bogota. Few could have imagined that, as a political adviser 
and the planner of innovative campaign strategies, this tiny 
man--but a man gifted with great soul and a superior mind able 
to intuit where and how the adversary might respond--could 
indeed have such talent for advising. This without mentioning 
that the advisee would follow every recommendation he would make 
to the letter. 
  It is because of Luis Alberto's happy-go-lucky nature that 
he 
has many friends inside and outside of this government in which 
he plays such an active part as minister of development, 
replacing Jorge Ospina Sardi. 
  However, it is precisely this factor that forces me to write 
the following, albeit with a number of cordial reservations, not 
about Moreno's performance as an official, but rather, 
concerning his unbounded--and now blatant--pro-Pastranism in his 
capacity as minister. Theoretically, it would all be acceptable, 
insofar as Andres claims that he is not a candidate and, 
consequently, that Moreno cannot head his campaign. However, we 
all know that this tactic is as shrewd as it is artful and that 
Andres could just as easily be a presidential candidate in a 
month as Luis Alberto could be his campaign director and most 
trustworthy alter ego. 
  I am not saying that the minister of development is "shaking 
down" or blackmailing industrialists by saying that if they do 
not vote for Pastrana or start filling his coffers, they will 
not have the sympathetic ear of the business sector's 
representative in the Executive Branch, which is, to a certain 
extent, the role that a good Development Ministry should play. 
However, it remains to be seen how committed or uncommitted 
those same businessmen feel--politically and 
economically--toward the man who functions as their spokesman in 
government. Indeed, it is obvious that Moreno has never missed 
an opportunity to "campaign" for Andres and that more than a few 
institutions overseen by his ministry have become abnormally 
pro-Pastrana, as in the case of the Tourism Corporation and the 
Office of Superintendent of Companies. To draw a valid contrast, 
no such thing has occurred with the other Cabinet ministers, who 
have respected strict official impartiality. Finally, from his 
current office, Moreno is and will continue to be--for as long 
as he serves as minister--the confidant of Andres, who, even if 
he has never formally declared it, is for all practical purposes 
a presidential candidate. 
  The straw that broke the camel's back is the report--which, 
if true, would be extremely serious--that as minister of 
development, Moreno accompanied Pastrana on his recent trip to 
Venezuela and was present during the hour-and-a-half-long 
meeting they had with President Ramon J. Velasquez, a meeting 
arranged by Moreno at Pastrana's request. What if any one of the 
Liberal precandidates had done likewise as the result of our 
minister of government's arrangements, for example? Would that 
minister not have been condemned--immediately--for openly 
meddling in politics and for an absolute lack of neutrality in 
his actions, as an employee (and not just any) of the 
administration? 
  So close to elections, it would be as awkward as it would be 
useless to claim that Moreno should drop his pro-Pastrana stance 
overnight, but I do not think it would be far-fetched or 
bold--much less unjust--to ask him to cease being a Pastrana 
activist while he holds an official post that undeniably grants 
him powers and prerogatives he would most certainly lack without 
that Cabinet post. It is one that unquestionably complicates 
things in terms of guarantees, all the more so when certain 
political observers do not understand the systematic ambiguity 
of Pastranism that is so deeply embedded in a Liberal regime, on 
the one hand, while at the same time being critical, highly 
critical, of that same regime in various ways (witness LA 
PRENSA's repeated tirades). The same observers understand even 
less the latent accusation that, from the very center of power, 
support for Andres is subtly drummed up and in the form of 
actions which, like the one reported, are so difficult to cover 
up or deny.

<F P=106> [Article: "Pastrana Takes Up Defense of Development </F>
Minister"] 
  [Excerpt] Andres Pastrana Arango, head of the New 
Democratic Force, came out in defense of Development Minister 
Luis Alberto Moreno yesterday, stating that that official had 
not improperly intervened in politics. 
  Breaking his silence, Liberal precandidate Ernesto Samper 
told this daily newspaper that only the Attorney General's 
Office and the nation's president can judge Moreno's conduct. 
  "The proper persons to assess the conduct of Minister Luis 
Alberto Moreno, who, along with Conservative candidate Andres 
Pastrana, met with Presidents Rafael Caldera and Ramon J. 
Velasquez in Caracas, are the attorney general and the 
president, rather than the very Conservative candidate who 
accompanied Minister Moreno on his trip to Venezuela," Samper 
said. 
  Although Pastrana claimed yesterday that he did not know 
whether Moreno's trip to Caracas had been officially authorized 
by President Gaviria, he did say that simply speaking with a 
chief of state or president-elect does not constitute improper 
meddling in politics. He also denied that the fact that Moreno 
has invited him to a number of public meetings constitutes 
active campaigning for his presidential candidacy. 
  Pastrana answered reporters' questions at the conclusion of 
a 
meeting with members of the Conservative National Leadership who 
paid him a visit at his political headquarters. 
  Despite Pastrana's reply, the Samper campaign, via spokesman 
Marco Julio Gutierrez, continued its accusations of partiality 
on the part of the minister of development and added more 
photographic evidence to the petition submitted to the Office of 
Attorney General seeking Moreno's removal. At a meeting of 
deputies, members of the Samper bench concluded that the 
government should address the issue of the minister's work in 
Pastrana's behalf. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mexico City, 14 Jan (DPA) -- Manual Camacho Solis, 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, today 
formally accepted the mediation of Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San 
Cristobal de las Casas, with the Zapatist National Liberation 
Front (EZLN). 
  In statements made in this colonial city in southeastern 
Mexico, Camacho Solis said that Monsignor Ruiz will also play a 
key role in the effort to approach the guerrillas to establish a 
dialogue. Ruiz, who with two other bishops from Chiapas State 
had offered to mediate at the beginning of the armed conflict on 
1 January, was proposed by the guerrilla organization itself. 
  Also proposed were 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta 
Menchu and journalist Julio Scherer Garcia, director of the 
magazine PROCESO. Menchu in the beginning seemed willing to 
contribute to the dialogue process, but Scherer Garcia declined 
the invitation. 
  Camacho Solis, appointed as commissioner for peace by 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, said that thus far he has 
not established contact with the rebel group and reiterated that 
the negotiation process will probably be lengthy. The former 
foreign secretary and mayor of Mexico City, known in political 
circles as a skillful negotiator and peace-maker, has been in 
San Cristobal de las Casas from 12 January, working with Bishop 
Ruiz on a plan for rapprochement with the EZLN. 
  The framework for the negotiations plan is the cease-fire 
unilaterally decreed by President Salinas de Gortari on 12 
January, two days after Camacho Solis was appointed peace 
commissioner.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo; from the "Vector 21" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, head of a special commission 
for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas State, held a news 
conference on 14 January before heading for Mexico City where, 
according to Camacho, he will make consultations and meet with 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  He made important statements about the peace dialogue in 
this 
state. Camacho said that the outlook has changed; peace should 
not involve a restoration of the status quo but the solution of 
the political-military problem. It should also involve an 
orderly and institutional leadership in the countryside, he 
added. 
  Camacho said that we must implement the necessary measures 
to 
effect peace in Chiapas, but this should not be the result of a 
conventional negotiation of the conflict. He said that there 
are many beliefs and issues that still trouble the residents and 
undermine peace in Chiapas. 
  The commissioner said that Chiapas residents must analyze 
these beliefs and issues. He added that changes must be 
made--for example, changes to the Penal Code. Camacho said that 
we must open a formal negotiation process by ensuring that the 
conditions that are established will enable the parties involved 
to reach the goal. 
  He said that the government and local leaders must make 
legislative changes, but only Chiapas residents should determine 
which changes must be made. Camacho added that the most 
important thing at this time is to ensure that united efforts in 
this state will achieve security, justice, and democracy. 
  We now know who will be the mediator; that is, the direct 
contact between the special commission for peace and 
reconciliation headed by Manuel Camacho Solis and the Zapatista 
National Liberation Army [EZLN]. That person will be Bishop 
Samuel Ruiz. Camacho said that Ruiz is a valuable and highly 
respected person in the state and was proposed as mediator by 
the EZLN. He will be the direct link in the process to 
determine whether the interlocutors that the EZLN selected are 
valid and whether peace can be negotiated with them, Camacho 
added: 
  [Begin Camacho recording] The EZLN, via public communiques, 
has proposed Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal de las 
Casas, as mediator. I think that the bishop's participation in 
this process, along with the other Chiapas bishops, will be 
important. Any idea or proposal received through Ruiz will be 
immediately considered. 
  As I said upon arriving in San Cristobal, it will take some 
time to restore peace in Chiapas. If we managed, however, to 
turn into a clear political concept the efforts of the civilian 
movement for peace, the unification of Chiapas residents to 
achieve security, justice, and democracy, state and municipal 
institutions, the decisions of the federal Executive Branch, 
work in communities and organizations, pastoral reconciliation 
messages, open and objective information, the efforts of the 
churches, and the role of the Congress of the Union what seems 
impossible could become reality. [sentence as heard] [end 
recording] 
  Camacho added that only the combination of everyone's 
goodwill, intelligence, and honesty will prevent the outcome of 
this conflict from resembling those that have harmed other 
countries in Central America. He said that at this time peace 
must be built via specific dialogue. 
  Ruiz gave thanks for this responsibility, which he described 
as a very heavy burden we must shoulder. He added: I will try 
to reconcile my pastoral duties with my mediator duties.

  [Text] In Queretaro, Luis Donaldo Colosio, Institutional 
Revolutionary Party [PRI] presidential candidate, has just ended 
his first campaign tour. He visited Pedro Escobedo and San Juan 
del Rio and later went to Hidalgo. Pablo Martin Contreras, 
president of the Otomi people, gave Colosio the staff of command 
in Ixmiquilpan, in the heart of the Mezquital Valley, where 
Colosio received the support of the Indian population. In 
downtown Ixmiquilpan he met with PRI members from Hidalgo. He 
said that what is most painful is learning first hand the 
difficult conditions that many Mexican communities face daily. 
He added that shortages are intolerable and cannot be accepted 
and that poverty should not be accepted as one's destiny. 
  At an event attended by thousands of peasants, Colosio 
emphasized that things must be called by their names because 
Mexico rejects lies and demagoguery, which are deceptive. The 
PRI candidate called for a decisive battle to end poverty, 
deprivation, and inequality in Mexico. He also talked about the 
Chiapas situation. 
  [Begin Colosio recording] In the difficult times that 
Chiapas State is experiencing, we must all reiterate our desire, 
our fervent desire, and our determination to have only one 
Mexico. To face the challenge of poverty, the fatherland needs 
unity, harmony, and work. This is what the gleam of hope in the 
eyes of Hidalgo children, of Chiapas children, and of all 
Mexican children is asking. [end recording] 
  Colosio said that the Chiapas and Mezquital Valley 
situations 
demonstrate the urgent need for more just conditions. He 
added that the solution is sweeping social reform. 
  [Begin Colosio recording] Today we are encouraged by 
progress in the negotiations. The Mexican Army's declaration of 
a cease-fire shows willingness to find ways to bring peace to 
this Mexican region. [end recording] 
  Colosio pointed out that talks, reconciliation, and the 
strengthening of the state of law will continue to promote 
stability in Mexico. Later, he met with the PRI political 
council in Pachuca and with Hidalgo women. He also attended a 
social event.

  [Text] In Mexico City the PAN [National Action Party] 
candidate said that other presidential candidates should not use 
the Chiapas situation to their benefit. During the weekly PAN 
news conference, presidential candidate Diego Fernandez de 
Cevallos spoke about events in Chiapas and called on other 
presidential candidates: 
  [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] In view of the 
latest 
violent events in Chiapas, I believe there should be, not only 
from me but from all presidential candidates, respect and basic 
prudence not to take advantage of this painful moment to try and 
gain an advantage. [end recording] 
  The other topic discussed during the PAN news conference had 
to do with the presidential candidates' debates. Fernandez de 
Cevallos rejected the proposal that the nine candidates debate 
in two sessions. 
  [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] I said that I do not 
reject that all candidates appear. What I protest is the 
intention to reduce the discussion of the country's major 
conflicts and topics to only two appearances. It is not 
possible, even with the country's modern communications system 
and especially with the high expectations generated, that these 
debates be reduced to two appearances for all presidential 
candidates. It is not fair, it is not correct, and it is not 
democratic. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Mexico City, 15 Jan (EFE) -- Mexican Foreign 
Secretary Manuel Tello last night described as offensive to 
Mexico a proposal by U.S. Representative Robert Torricelli, a 
Democrat, that the U.S. Congress investigate the Chiapas events. 
  Torricelli is calling on Clinton administration officials 
and 
human rights advocates to testify at a hearing on the Chiapas 
uprising. 
  "The United States should make very clear to the Mexican 
Government the type of political reforms required if we are to 
maintain a new relationship," stated the Democratic 
representative, who said the hearing has been scheduled for 2 
February. 
  Tello said Torricelli's initiative is unfriendly and 
offensive. It seems that the legislator is unaware, Tello 
stated, of the measures the Mexican Government has taken to find 
a peaceful solution to the conflict in Chiapas. 
  It seems that they want to take up the old arguments that 
went on during the NAFTA debate and link commercial policies to 
interventionist intentions in Mexico, the foreign relations 
secretary concluded. [no quotation marks as received] 
  A group of U.S. legislators who support NAFTA have sent a 
letter to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to express their 
concern over the events in Chiapas and to ask him to facilitate 
investigations by human rights groups and the media in the area 
of conflict. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari received 
important visitors at Los Pinos this afternoon. Jaime Serra 
Puche, Mexican secretary of commerce and industrial development, 
U.S. Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, and Roy MacLaren, 
Canadian international trade minister, arrived at the 
presidential residence shortly after 1330. Serra, Kantor, and 
MacLaren held a private meeting earlier this morning to set in 
motion the Free Trade Labor Commission, which is based in 
Mexico, the Free Trade Agreement Commission on Labor Affairs 
based in the United States, and the Environmental Commission 
based in Canada. 
  The commerce ministers' meeting with President Salinas was 
also behind closed doors, and, as we all know, following this 
meeting they went over to the Secofin [Commerce and Industrial 
Development Secretariat] building to hold a joint news 
conference.

  [Text] Mexico City, 15 Jan (EFE) -- According to press 
reports, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari asked today 
Jorge Madrazo, president of the National Human Rights Committee 
(CNDH), to take steps to liberate former Chiapas Governor 
Absalon Castellanos. 
  In an unofficial version released by the press, Salinas 
asked 
the CNDH president to establish contacts with the Zapatista 
National Liberation Army (EZLN) to attain the liberation of the 
soldier and politician, who was kidnapped by guerrillas in the 
early days of the conflict. 
  According to the press, the government is trying to handle 
this affair discretely in order to ease the negotiation with the 
captors. 
  EZLN Representatives had stated that they would subject the 
former governor to a summary trial for repressing the indigenous 
peoples and peasants of Chiapas during his regime. Castellanos 
was kidnapped from his San Joaquin Ranch in Las Margaritas 
Municipality, Chiapas State. 
  The doctors of the Social Security Institute, who were set 
free in Guadalupe Tepeyac Municipality, have reported that 
General Castellanos was still alive and in a normal condition. 
  According to a journalistic version, the EZLN has informed 
his relatives that they will subject the former governor's fate 
to a vote, whereas another version has reported the total 
silence of his captors and that the general was in the town of 
Maravillas Trinidad.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 15 Jan (AFP) -- 
The Mexican Army torched on 7 January a warehouse "full of 
bodies" near Altamirano in the southern State of Chiapas, 
charged here on Saturday five Indians who were "beaten and 
tortured" by military personnel. 
  The Indians, who spoke to reporters in this city without 
disclosing their identity, said they were captured by Army 
troops 6 January in Altamirano and locked up all night inside a 
coffee warehouse in which there were at least "25 to 30 bodies." 
  The group, which was arrested "for investigation" by the 
Army, claimed they saw the bodies, "which were already cold," 
moments before the soldiers blindfolded them and tied their 
hands, which show signs of cuts and bruises. 
  The soldiers pushed the prisoners to the floor, very close 
to 
the bodies, and then lighted candles, warning them that "we are 
having a wake for them and we might as well have one for you, 
because we will shoot you tomorrow." 
  The five Indians, all from Altamirano, recounted how they 
spent the night hand tied and blindfolded, lying down close to 
the bodies, and that the soldiers returned the following morning 
and evacuated them from the warehouse "with blows" and forced 
them into a military truck parked a few meters away. 
  They added that from the truck they were able to see that 
the 
military personnel sprayed the warehouse with gasoline--and 
minutes later "we heard an explosion." 
  The group was taken immediately to the town of Margaritas, 
where the military truck picked up four other people who were 
arrested and took them to the headquarters in Comitan, where 
there were "16 more prisoners," they stated. 
  At the headquarters, the Indians were "interrogated, beaten, 
and tortured" with electric shocks and blows to the testicles, 
according to the account they gave to reporters. 
  Later, they said, they were turned over to the Tuxtla 
Gutierrez judicial authorities where for the first time in their 
four days of capture they were able to "eat and drink water." 
Subsequently, they were confined to a cell of Prison Ward Number 
1 "along with 35 more Indians" of Chiapas. They added that in 
that cell they also saw "several Central Americans," including 
Hondurans, who told them they had been captured as undocumented 
and that the Army "forced them to say they were guerrillas." 
  After eight days of captivity, the five Indians, who were 
arrested for presumed "criminal association," were released 14 
January in this city by authorities, for lack of evidence. 
  During the past few hours, international human rights 
organizations, including Americas Watch, and former U.S. 
District Attorney Ramsey Clark demanded that the Mexican 
Government clear up charges of alleged human rights violations 
of Indians and peasants by the Army in Chiapas. 
  Two weeks after the rebel uprising in the southern part of 
the country, the government is trying to establish a dialogue 
with the rebels to halt the warring conflict, which thus far has 
left an official toll of 100 dead, a figure that local church 
organizations have estimated at over 400.

  [Text] Mexico City, 15 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Military 
authorities rejected today charges of human rights violations 
during the conflict in Chiapas State, recalling that the armed 
group began the attacks, and they reiterated their commitment to 
act according to the law. 
  "The military's actions are and shall be at all times 
directed toward respecting the physical and moral integrity of 
the people" of the southern Mexican State of Chiapas, the 
Secretariat of National Defense announced in a communique 
released on Saturday. 
  The charges of alleged human rights violations by the troops 
"are based solely on alleged rumors and sensationalism," which 
confuse the people, the communique read. 
  The clashes in Altos de Chiapas, where the self-styled 
Zapatista National Liberation Army occupied several towns on 1 
January, left 100 dead and an undetermined number of people 
wounded. 
  Those who accuse the Army of violating human rights seem to 
forget that 24 policemen were killed and 35 were wounded, as 
well as more than 100 civilians reported missing at the hands of 
the armed group, the National Defense Secretariat stated. 
  It also recalled that the armed group began the clashes when 
it attacked Rancho Nuevo Headquarters, near the town of San 
Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas, 1,200 km southeast of Mexico 
City. 
  The armed group occupied and destroyed public buildings and 
"used terror to subdue" the population, hid their dead, and 
"very probably buried them clandestinely." 
  The Defense Secretariat reported that the Army turned over 
the individuals arrested during the conflict to civilian 
authorities and informed them of the deaths registered among the 
armed group. 
  It mentioned that, within the imitations imposed by the 
conflict, the military authorities have provided their best help 
to the National Human Rights Commission, which traveled to 
Chiapas State at the beginning of the clashes. 
  The Army's participation is fully justified, as they have 
responded to the attack against the garrison, the demands for 
help from the government of Chiapas State, and the reiterated 
aggressions on the troops, the secretariat added. 
  There is a relative calm in that area of Chiapas State after 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari appointed last week former 
Foreign Minister Manuel Camacho Solis commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation and announced the cessation of the Army's 
offensive operations.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Lopez Castaneda] </F>
  [Excerpts] San Cristobal de las Casas, 15 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- 
The possibility of a dialogue to end the conflict seemed to be 
drawing closer on Saturday, 15 January, in the wake of the 
government offer to give "immediate attention" to any genuine 
proposal by the armed group operating in southeastern Mexico. 
Fifteen days into the conflict, this region of Los Altos de 
Chiapas -- approximately 200 km southeast of Mexico City -- was 
calm following a brief violation of the unilateral truce the 
government ordered 72 hours ago. [passage omitted] 
  Following a three-hour meeting with President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari in Mexico City last night, Manuel Camacho Solis, 
special commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, 
said that negotiations in Chiapas are advancing although the 
problem is very complex. 
  Without going into details, Camacho Solis said: "We are 
working well in a serious manner. It is a complex problem, but 
the approach is appropriate." 
  On Friday a group of armed men broke the truce established 
by 
a presidential order to suspend military operations in Los Altos 
de Chiapas by attacking an army unit on a stretch of the highway 
to Oconsingo. There were no casualties. [passage omitted] 
  Last night Camacho Solis announced that Bishop Samuel Ruiz 
of 
San Cristobal de las Casas will be the practical "liaison" to 
establish contact with the armed group. 
  The clergyman, known as a strong defender of Indians in 
Chiapas, made an appeal "to seek alternative means" to solve the 
major, profound problems affecting the region. 
  Camacho Solis offered to give his immediate attention to any 
genuine proposal made by the armed group through Bishop Ruiz, 
who last week agreed to a petition by the rebels to serve as 
mediator in the dialogue with the government. 
  "Peace will be the result of a solution to the military and 
political problems, as well as of an orderly and institutional 
handling of the changes to be made in the region," the peace 
commissioner noted. 
  "If Chiapas achieves reconciliation by taking steps forward, 
instead of being a problem for the country, it will provide a 
major contribution to the nation as a whole," Camacho Solis 
added. Los Altos de Chiapas is a region of 100 square km with 
a largely Indian population which, the government acknowledges, 
lives in extreme poverty. 
  A communique by the Bishops Committee on Peace [Comision 
Episcopal para la Paz] announced that a mission of bishops will 
visit the conflict area to convince the armed militants to agree 
to a dialogue after laying down their weapons. [passage omitted 
on background material] 
  Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark has also joined 
the repeated appeals for talks. He is a delegate of a human 
rights organization based in Southern California. [passage 
omitted on background material] 
  Clark's visit coincided with a report by the National Human 
Rights Committee, headed by ombudsman Jorge Madrazo, that 60 
percent of the cases reported as missing during the conflict 
have been resolved. 
  Madrazo noted that out of 231 persons reported missing in 
the 
10 days of fighting and attacks, 163 have been found.

  [Excerpt] Mexico City, 16 Jan (AFP) -- The political and 
military situation in southern Mexico this Sunday remains 
unchanged in anticipation of the guerrillas' reply to the 
government's dialogue proposal, which, according to rebel 
leaders, could happen "very soon." 
  In interviews published by local media today, "Major Mario" 
of the Zapatist National Liberation Front (EZLN) announced that 
he will reply to the official dialogue proposal and will respect 
the unilateral truce decreed by the government. "We are 
respecting the cease fire. We will not attack the government, 
but we will respond if they come to harass us," Major Mario 
asserted. Mario is a 21- year-old Tzeital Indian who spoke to 
a group of reporters "somewhere in the Lacandona jungle" in 
Chiapas state. 
  The rebel chieftain asserted that "very soon the EZLN Indian 
Clandestine Committee will answer the government," although "we 
will not stop the war" until the 10 conditions presented by the 
guerrillas have been met, including a total cease-fire, a halt 
to the bombing, and official recognition of the EZLN as a 
belligerent force. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mexico City, 16 Jan (EFE) -- According to news 
reports, the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) will 
observe the truce and will not stage attacks, but it will 
respond if attacked and will continue the war until its 10 
demands are met. 
  Journalists who visited an EZLN camp for the first time have 
reported that the EZLN leader known as "Major Mario" has 
announced that the EZLN Indian Clandestine Committee will answer 
very soon the government concerning its dialogue proposals. 
  "Major Mario" has denied the EZLN is attempting to establish 
socialism, but he insisted that the Indians and peasants will 
struggle for the fulfillment of the 10 points of their program: 
democracy, jobs, fraud-free elections, independence, land for 
peasants, jobs [as received], housing, health, justice and 
education. 
  The Zapatista leader said the war will not end until these 
demands are met, and the EZLN will not disarm, because, he said, 
"we would rather die fighting with dignity than from cholera and 
measles and repressed by landowners;" we want freedom, the right 
to express ourselves, democracy, and true peace. 
  "Major Mario" assured that the EZLN has respected the truce, 
but the Army has continued to attack, and the EZLN rebels have 
orders to defend themselves and have only responded to the 
attacks. 
  Concerning rapprochement with Manuel Camacho, commissioner 
for peace and reconciliation, "Major Mario" has said this 
decision must be made by "Commander Marcos;" he added that the 
rebels are Mexicans and natives of Chiapas who acknowledge 
Mexico's flag and national anthem. 
  In response to a question on war casualties, the Zapatista 
rebel denounced that the Army murdered civilians, dressed them 
as Zapatistas and blamed the EZLN for their murder. "Major 
Mario" said the Army is no longer dealing with unarmed peasants. 
  "Major Mario" said the uprising was decided by the 
Clandestine Committee after seeking out every legal path, 
finding no results. The government has destroyed Article 27 of 
the Constitution, and the North American Free Trade Agreement 
will only foster poverty.

<F P=106> ["Special message" by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in </F>
Mexico City -- live] 
  [Text] Mexicans: In view of recent developments in Chiapas 
State, the nation remains fully committed to peace. Social 
organizations, religious associations, the news media, the 
country's political forces, and all citizens are decidedly 
against violence. A defined and clear sentiment exists in favor 
of a solution that saves lives and ensures the path of justice. 
The efficient action by the Mexican Army and the decision for a 
unilateral cease-fire have increased tranquillity in the 
affected areas of Chiapas and in the country. The government 
has taken the path of conciliation and union among Mexicans so 
this painful situation will not be repeated. For that reason, I 
have decided to ask the Permanent Committee of the National 
Congress to immediately convoke a extraordinary period of 
sessions. I will submit a bill to grant a general amnesty to 
everyone who participated in the violence that has affected 
several towns in Chiapas from 1 January to 1100 [1700 GMT] 
today, 16 January. Any criminal action against towns or the 
Mexican Army after that time will not receive the benefit of 
amnesty. 
  With this decision, the Mexican state is making it clear 
that 
it seeks peace. Those who have entered into a confrontation 
with the state no longer have any pretext for refusing to 
peacefully rejoin their communities and participate in the tasks 
of meeting needs and overcoming vices through solidarity. In 
the days ahead, I will implement an overall justice program in 
the upper and jungle areas of Chiapas. With this program the 
federal government will join the decisions and work by all 
Chiapas residents without exception. I will continue to act in 
favor of the security, tranquillity, and greater justice Chiapas 
State needs. I will continue asking for cooperation from all in 
these decisions and for the indispensable participation of 
Chiapas residents in the responsible search for peace and 
justice. In this way Congress will play the key role that 
befits it to continue advancing toward the restoral of peace in 
that area of Chiapas. 
  Fellow countrymen, the president continues making all 
decisions available to him to protect the people, avoid 
violence, and find justice. With this amnesty law initiative 
and the additional effort for justice, we will strengthen the 
harmony of the republic and the unity of the nation. Thank you.

  [Text] Mexico City, 16 Jan (EFE) -- The presidential 
candidates of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), 
National Action Party (PAN), and the Party of the Democratic 
Revolution (PRD) have stated their approval of the amnesty 
decree announced today by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio termed as timely and 
welcome the initiative, which will settle the situation in 
southern Chiapas State, adding "everything done to attain peace 
in the region is welcome." 
  PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos said everything 
that leads to the achievement of peace and justice must be 
supported by all Mexicans, adding that if the amnesty is the 
only option that guarantees peace, "I support the government's 
decision." 
  Fernandez de Cevallos said events in Chiapas do not endanger 
the conditions for holding elections this year; quite the 
contrary--they prove the people's clamor for a fair and 
democratic electoral process. 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, PRD candidate, said the 
proposed amnesty for the armed people in Chiapas represents a 
step toward creating conditions that allow a settlement and 
understanding on the conflict. 
  Cardenas--who termed as positive the fact that the 
government 
has decreed a ceasefire and is willing to decree an 
amnesty--stated his confidence solutions will soon be found to 
the state's problems. 
  The PRD candidate considered it urgently necessary to grant 
Indian representatives access to positions in which decisions 
are adopted to solve the conflict. 
  Cardenas demanded the replacement of acting Chiapas Governor 
Elmar Setzer with another who has the Indian communities' 
support and recognition.

<F P=106> [Report by Victor Godinez] </F>
  [Excerpts] San Cristobal de Las Casas, 16 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- 
The amnesty proposed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari for 
the people involved in the Chiapas State rebellion is the "most 
important decision" for attaining peace in the area, 
Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis said here today. 
  "The most important decision to contribute to the 
reestablishment of peace has been made today. It is a risky 
moment, because there could be provocations aimed at undermining 
the peace process," the peace and reconciliation commissioner 
said in Chiapas. 
  [Passage omitted] 
  Regarding the timeframe for the presidential initiative, 
Camacho said it is "an amnesty for what has already taken place, 
and that is the reason for the timeframe" set by Salinas de 
Gortari. 
  [Passage omitted] 
  During a news conference, Camacho spoke of the first steps 
and signs of conciliation that he has received without saying he 
has received direct messages from the spokesmen of the armed 
group in response to his calls to dialogue and reconciliation. 
  "We are negotiating through facts, with messages of concord 
in both directions, which is already yielding its first 
results," he said. 
  The National Congress, which must ratify the presidential 
proposal, now plays "a leading role for attaining peace, as the 
nation's general feeling is for reconciliation," the former 
foreign minister said. 
  He said the amnesty will ease "the return of members of the 
self- styled Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN] to their 
communities and the reintegration to their jobs, which required 
that we advance in the topic of guarantees." 
  To attain the pacification of Chiapas State, it will be 
necessary to "set the bases for a peace with justice, guide the 
changes politically," and "favor the construction of channels 
for the effective and authentic political participation of the 
different indigenous groups," he added. 
  He reiterated that he believes the armed group "is basically 
a Mexican and Chiapan movement." 
  The return of the kidnapped former governor of Chiapas 
State, 
Absalon Castellanos, would be a conciliatory message from the 
armed group, Solis said. 
  "The EZLN is an organization that, regardless of methods, of 
which we disapprove, has shown it has political clarity; 
therefore, I hope they realize that for their cause it is better 
that General Castellanos be alive, not dead."

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Rubio from the "Good Morning From </F>
Mexico" newscast] 
  [Text] Significant and specific advancements have been made 
following the presidential bill granting general amnesty to 
everyone who participated in the violence in Chiapas State. 
Rumors of clashes between the Mexican Army and rebels have 
turned out to be just that: only rumors. Here in Chiapas, most 
people have returned to their daily activities. 
  Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas, held a news conference upon his 
return to Mexico City. He warned that even with the presidential 
bill granting general amnesty to everyone who participated in 
the violence in Chiapas, there is still a risk of falling into 
provocations that could hinder the peace process. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] In facing this situation, 
the country is strong, civilian society is mobilized, the 
national and international media are vigilant, and the Army is 
loyal to the executive branch and the nation, which prefers a 
political solution to an escalation of the conflict. [end 
recording] 
  Regarding rumors of clashes, Camacho Solis said firmly that 
unlike some other countries, the civilian government controls 
the Armed Forces in Mexico. He added that he hopes the Indians 
have received President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's message, 
which he read in the Tzotzil, Tzetal, and (Chol) languages. 
  San Cristobal de las Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia during 
his Sunday homily expressed his satisfaction about the 
conciliatory messages exchanged by both sides. Bishop Ruiz 
Garcia invited Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis to come 
to the altar, to which Camacho replied: I am just a faithful 
Christian. Bishop Ruiz Garcia responded: I am bishop of this 
Diocese, but I am also a citizen. 
  Before approximately 3,000 parishioners, Ruiz Garcia said he 
has received threatening telephone calls. 
  [Begin Ruiz Garcia recording] Without trying to be 
conspicuous, without any deception in my words, but with a 
sincere heart, I tell all those who have recently said they will 
make me disappear -- even making such threats in public places 
-- and all those who have left threatening messages -- even 
though I have also received encouraging phone calls -- that 
although I know their names, I harbor no hard feelings against 
them in my heart. [end recording] 
  In closing the homily, Ruiz Garcia said the eyes of the 
world 
are on Mexico and urged the parties involved in the conflict to 
meet and show their willingness to find a solution through 
genuine national fraternity.

<F P=106> ["Special Report" by Juan Carlos Santoyo from San Cristobal </F>
de las Casas] 
  [Text] [Anchorman Calderon] In a few minutes we are going 
to have a report on some very important news. We are waiting 
for a telephone call from one of our correspondents. Is he on 
the telephone? Is he ready? Here is Juan Carlos Santoyo, who 
is the ACIR group correspondent in San Cristobal de las Casas in 
Chiapas. We are going to put him on the air. Are we on the air? 
We are listening to your report, as it seems to be very 
important. 
  [Santoyo] That's right, Mr. Calderon. After days of waiting, 
today we can see a breakthrough in communications between the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] and Manuel Camacho 
Solis, special commissioner for peace and reconciliation in 
Chiapas. A few minutes ago, Camacho Solis hosted a 
news...[pauses] He is now holding a news conference. He is 
reporting that the first formal, official contact was 
established with EZLN leaders. He received a communication 
directly from Deputy Commander Marcos. Mr. Calderon, I am going 
to play an excerpt of that news conference during which this 
major announcement was made. It constitutes another step toward 
peace and reconciliation in this state. 
  [Calderon] You are going to broadcast an excerpt of the news 
conference. 
  [Begin recording] [Camacho] I will be very brief [four- 
second break in reception] I want to tell you that I have 
already received an official message from the EZLN signed by 
Deputy Commander Marcos. I am going to Mexico City to brief the 
president, other members of the government, and those who should 
be informed of the communique. We will have a formal reply for 
the EZLN tomorrow at 1100 [1700 GMT]. Things are on the right 
track. The decision to initiate a cease-fire and -- above all 
-- the decision to request the Permanent Committee of the 
National Congress to convoke a extraordinary period of sessions 
so the executive can submit a general amnesty bill are yielding 
results. The path of harmony and conciliation is the right 
path, as the facts are proving. [end recording] 
  [Santoyo] Mr. Calderon, this is very important information 
because this is the first contact between the EZLN and the 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation. Basically, we were 
told the points to be negotiated are those contained in the 
first communique the EZLN issued on 6 January. Those points 
include the demand for the definitive withdrawal of Mexican Army 
troops from the zone and the withdrawal of many troops to their 
garrisons. The cease-fire was also mentioned. They also 
demanded a process of true reconstruction in Chiapas. As you 
heard, the commissioner for peace and reconciliation will have 
an answer tomorrow at 1100. 
  [Calderon] What time did Mr. Camacho give the news 
conference 
in San Cristobal de las Casas? 
  [Santoyo] At exactly 1135 [1735 GMT]. We left for a while to 
broadcast this first good news.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 17 Jan (AFP) -- 
The Mexican Government "is using the economic and military aid" 
that it receives from the United States to "massacre the Chiapas 
Indians," the Zapatist National Liberation Front [EZLN] rebels 
charged in a message addressed on 13 January to President Bill 
Clinton. The letter was published today by the local newspaper 
EL TIEMPO. 
  Signed by Subcommander Marcos, who explained that there will 
be a delay in delivery with the package of documents issued from 
7 to 13 January--the texts of which referred to the 
cease-fire--to Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho, they reject 
any charges that they attacked "civilian objectives," among 
other things. 
  In an 11 January text, the EZLN stated "it does not know 
Camacho Solis, but if this gentleman truly and honestly wants to 
find a political and fair solution, we hail his appointment as 
peace commissioner and we reiterate to him our willingness to 
dialogue." 
  Camacho stated on Monday that he received a new message from 
the Zapatistas, which is why he went to the capital to brief 
Carlos Salinas on, with the certainty that there would be a 
response for them by 18 January. 
  Salinas announced on 16 January that he will send to 
Congress 
"a draft law granting general amnesty" to EZLN members who 
rebelled in Chiapas 15 days ago. This was considered by 
political and social sectors as a new step toward peace. 
  In a 6 January communique, the EZLN requested, among other 
things for dialogue, its recognition as a belligerent force, a 
cease-fire, the withdrawal of government troops from Chiapas, 
and democratic and social benefits. 
  In the message to Clinton, the U.S. Congress and people, the 
EZLN asked if they "approved this military and economic aid to 
combat narcotrafficking and to kill Indians in the southeastern 
part of Mexico." 
  "Troops, aircraft, helicopters, radar and communications 
equipment, firearms, and military weapons are now used not 
against narcotraffickers and the big drug lords of the drug 
mafias, but to repress the just struggles of the people of 
Mexico," it added. 
  The Zapatists claim "we have nothing to do with 
narcotrafficking or national or international terrorism," and 
they say that "with the support the U.S. Government and people 
offer to the federal government they are only staining their 
hands with the blood of Indians." 
  "Do not stain your hands with our blood, becoming an 
accomplice of the Mexican Government," because "our wish is for 
all the peoples of the world: true liberty and democracy," the 
message to the U.S. president concluded. 
  In a 13 January communique, the EZLN said that "no way will 
we turn over our weapons or surrender our forces to the evil 
government. The cease-fire is aimed at alleviating the 
situation of the civilian population in the combat zone and 
paves the way for dialogue with all the progressive and 
democratic sectors of Mexico."

  [Text] Mexico City, 17 Jan (EFE) -- The self-styled 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) stated today that in no 
way will it surrender its weapons or forces, on announcing its 
acceptance of the dialogue announced by the Mexican Government 
to find a political solution to the armed conflict in Chiapas. 
  Manuel Camacho Solis, peace commissioner for reconciliation 
in Chiapas, announced today in San Cristobal de las Casas that 
he had received the documents in which the EZLN agrees to 
dialogue with the government and announces that it will state 
its official response on 18 January. 
  In a series of documents sent by the EZLN to the press, the 
rebels announced their acceptance and expressed congratulations 
for the cease-fire ordered by Mexican President Carlos Salinas 
de Gortari and for the appointment of Manuel Camacho Solis. 
  The EZLN declared war on the Mexican Government on 1 January 
when it occupied four mayors' offices in the Chiapas State in 
confrontations which it said left an unofficial toll of 200 dead 
in the 11 days of clashes, after which Salinas de Gortari 
announced the unilateral cease-fire.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 14 Jan (NA) -- Interior Minister 
Carlos Ruckauf has stated that the Executive Branch is showing a 
"prudent, not alarmist" attitude. He added that following the 
Mexican crisis "any responsible government will seek to prevent 
a repetition in their countries." 
  Ruckauf said that democratic governments "are forced to 
maintain the monopoly of force," adding that this acts "as a 
mechanism of self-preservation." 
  He reaffirmed the Executive Branch's "conviction" that "a 
specific group caused the incidents," in Santiago del Estero. 
He added, however, that "there are no documents to prove that 
it involved a given sector or a precise trend." 
  Thus, Ruckauf specified that there are no documents to prove 
the presence of Shining Path guerrillas, although he admitted 
that "blank forms were found during some police raids" and that 
some Bolivian and Peruvian citizens "have problems with their 
documents." 
  He said: "This does not necessarily indicate that they are 
linked to guerrilla groups, merely to other types of crimes or 
even a simple covert migratory operation." 
  In an interview with a Buenos Aires daily, Ruckauf said the 
electricity service company Edesur [Southern Greater Buenos 
Aires Electricity Company] suffered some attacks on its 
installations. He said: "it would be premature to say that an 
armed organization are behind these terrorist acts." 
  In conclusion, the minister said the government has decided 
"it is better safe than sorry," which is why President Carlos 
Menem "ordered an analysis of the Latin American and Argentine 
situation."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Jan (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella has confirmed that the government is studying "generic 
information" that members of the Montonero movement who live in 
Mexico are active in the National Zapatist Liberation Army 
[EZLN] which is operating in that country. 
  Moreover, Di Tella denied that there will be a "witch-hunt" 
among foreign residents in Argentina, in search of presumed 
subversive elements. 
  The foreign minister said that President Carlos Menem was 
already concerned about the issue "before", especially because 
there were reports that members of several guerrilla groups 
which were active in the 1970's had sought refuge in Mexico and 
could have joined the EZLN. 
  "Many ex-guerrillas have been absorbed by the policy of 
democracy, others have not," the minister said in remarks to the 
newspaper CLARIN. 
  He said that the information being studied by the government 
was not provided by his Mexican counterpart. He also denied that 
the CIA had provided information on this matter, although he 
admitted that there had been an "exchange of information via 
diplomatic channels with the State Department and other Latin 
American governments." 
  He said that in the case of EZLN uprising in Chiapas, "there 
is a very important organization which was based on a social 
problem." He added that the Argentine socioeconomic situation is 
"totally different" from that of Mexico. 
  Although "there is the possibility of a subversive 
infiltration" in some Latin American countries, he explained 
that that is not the case in Argentina. 
  He thus ruled out the possibility that the alert given by 
the 
executive branch to the intelligence services on a supposed 
subversive outbreak could prompt "a witch-hunt." 
  However, yesterday some 30 illegal Peruvian residents were 
deported for "usurping a house" at 600 Senillosa Street, 
although there are still two weeks before 31 January, the legal 
deadline established by the Immigration Department for the 
regularization of foreigners who are in an illegal status.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jan (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
cut his visit to Uruguay short and this afternoon he returned to 
Buenos Aires from the city of Colonia de Sacramento, where he 
attended the fifth Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
presidential summit. 
  Menem arrived at the military area of "Jorge Newbery" 
Metropolitan Airport at 1545 local time [1845 GMT] and after 
staying a few minutes in the VIP lounge, he left for the Olivos 
presidential resident aboard a helicopter. 
  The president made no statement to reporters at the airport, 
where some minutes earlier Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo also 
had arrived from Colonia.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 Jan (NA) -- Interior Minister 
Carlos Ruckauf said today that the government does not fear new 
violence or subversive outbreaks but admitted that security 
measures will be reinforced. 
  In this regard, he said border controls will be intensified 
to neutralize the arrival of illegal immigrants, and that 
foreigners who violate residence regulations will be repatriated. 
  Ruckauf discarded the presence of activities linked to the 
Shining Path guerrilla organization but warned that activities 
by different clandestine organizations involved in bringing 
illegal aliens to the country are being investigated. 
  The government also is studying the possibility of investing 
about $40 million to re-equip provincial police and the Border 
Police to stop any attempt at violence. 
  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo will determine where to get 
the funds to purchase shields, rubber bullets, tear gas, and 
anti-riot equipment. Quick deployment forces capable of 
controlling outbreaks similar to the one in Santiago del Estero 
will be created. 
  In this regard, Ruckauf noted the work by the intelligence 
services that "worked well under a situation difficult to 
predict." 
  Regarding the repatriation of 30 Peruvians, Ruckauf 
explained 
that the same measure will be implemented with other illegal 
residents "even though Argentina continues its open-door policy." 
  Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella said the deportation 
of the illegal immigrants was made due "to the illegal 
occupation of houses and the lack of work contracts justifying 
their presence in Argentina." 
  Therefore, vigilance efforts will be intensified at the 
borders with the use of modern computerized control systems that 
will be obtained through international bids in the next 30 to 60 
days. 
  Ruckauf rejected any possibility of new outbreaks of 
violence, "but we will take all the necessary precautionary 
measures just in case."

  [Text] (DYN-NA) -- Amid continuing government anxiety that 
members of the Peruvian guerrilla organization Sendero Luminoso 
are infiltrating the country attracted by recent social unrest 
in the northern provinces, the government has strenuously denied 
that this fear was the cause for yesterday's deportation of 30 
Peruvian illegal immigrants. 
  The Foreign Ministry revealed that the workers, 17 men and 
13 
women, were deported on Friday [14 January] for not having 
obtained work permits and for squatting in a flat in the Federal 
Capital. 
  However, suspicion has since arisen that there may have been 
other motives in the decision to repatriate them since the 
government has given all illegal citizens until the end of this 
month to obtain the correct paperwork. 
  Denying that the action was tantamount to state xenophobia, 
Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf told reporters that it was 
simply a legal matter and quashed speculation that the 
government, who announced earlier in the week that security 
services were being put on alert to monitor possible cases of 
social unrest, was participating in a "witch-hunt." 
  Furthermore, deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella said 
on Radio Mitre yesterday that the Peruvian Embassy was fully 
aware of the situation and that nothing untoward had occurred. 
He added that the policy was part of a bilateral agreement 
between the two countries which could lead to visas being 
required to enter the country in order to stem the tide of 
illegal workers from the Andean country. 
  While the government has been attempting to play down its 
initial concern about the possibility of foreign and 
professional activists stirring up already latent frustration 
into violent protests, Buenos Aires Security Secretary Eduardo 
Pettigiani yesterday revealed that, despite assurances, the 
government is in a "constant state of concern." 
  He added that the national intelligence agencies were 
"working overtime" in order to clamp down on any suspicious 
activities. 
  In other related news yesterday ATE [Association of State 
Workers] State Workers' Union secretary-general Alba Luna del 
Castillo accused local government officials in Santiago del 
Estero of "sowing seeds of fear" into local residents who were 
contemplating taking part in Friday's protest march to 
commemorate last month's bloody riots. 
  She claimed that there were almost 3000 workers in the march 
through the province's capital, although police estimate that 
there were only a third of that figure. However, she lamented 
what she felt was a state campaign to strike fear into local 
residents by raising the spectre of Sendero Luminoso involvement. 
  In triumphant fashion Del Castillo told reporters that the 
march has again warned the national government of the intensity 
of the province's problems and that the people were demanding 
concrete action. 
  One positive development yesterday was the announcement that 
the Santiago del Estero Provincial Bank will re-open tomorrow 
for the first time since December's riots. Its first task will 
be to distribute unpaid salaries dating back to October to many 
of the region's disgruntled workers.

  [Text] (NA) -- Neuquen Bishop Jaime de Nevares accused 
President Carlos Menem yesterday [15 January] of being 
"obsessed" with his bid for re-election and urged him to spend 
more time thinking about how to cushion the poorer sectors of 
society who he said were bearing the brunt of current government 
economic policy. 
  The bishop, who two weeks ago announced that he would stand 
for election to the constituent assembly on behalf of the 
left-wing Frente Grande coalition, said in an interview with 
NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS news agency that the fact that Menem was 
"obsessed" with re-election was "vox populi." 
  He added that he personally was in favour of maintaining the 
current law that bars presidents from serving a second 
consecutive term and that the head of state should continue to 
serve the country for a period of six years. 
  However he drew comfort from the fact that his contribution 
to the constituent assembly would at least help the cause of 
securing some "positive aspects" in the reform of the national 
charter. 
  Later in an outspoken critique of government economic 
policy, 
the prelate said: "The social cost of economic success is very 
high for all to see." He concluded that "there must clearly be 
an alternative to the current model," and one that reached out 
to "all sectors of society and not just one." 
  Responding to a question as to whether the clergy should not 
be allowed to play a direct role in politics, he denied that 
there was any conflict of interests and said he was not taking 
part in party politics, but rather "acting for the common good." 
He also categorically ruled out any future in the political 
world after the constituent assembly ends its assessment of the 
need for constitutional reform in April of this year.

  [Text] The agreement signed by Carlos Menem and Raul 
Alfonsin to amend the Constitution has prompted different 
reactions among political leaders. Alvaro Alsogaray said that 
the "prospects are good" and expressed confidence that there 
will be no economic course change. Aldo Rico took a negative 
stance: "I refuse to be an accomplice in a process whose 
objective is to perpetuate the power of an entire family: the 
Menem brothers." Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez also fired his 
missiles. "The way politics is done in this country leaves a 
very bitter taste: the secrecy, the lies, the doubletalk," said 
the deputy representing the Great Front. 
  The agreement between Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin 
continued to make waves yesterday. For example, Liberal Alvaro 
Alsogaray expressed confidence that the pact for the partial 
reform of the Constitution will not change the course of the 
government's economic program. "The president's decision is 
apparently irrevocable," stated Alsogaray, adding that "the 
prospects are good if the reform is carried out" because "we 
need to undergo a transformation from a socialist and centrally 
planned system to a free-market economy with monetary stability." 
  From a different perspective, Aldo Rico, leader of the 
Dignity and Independence Movement (Modin), gave a different 
opinion. Rico did not mince words in expressing opposition to 
the Menem-Alfonsin pact: "As an elected deputy, I refuse to be 
an accomplice in a process whose sole objective is to perpetuate 
the power of an entire family: the Menem brothers." 
  Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez of the Great Front stated 
that 
the pact leaves "a very bitter taste about how politics is done 
in this country: the secrecy, the lies, the doubletalk." Alvarez 
said that the accord "is a political deal for Menem and 
Alfonsin, but many people are left out in the cold, for example, 
those who voted for the opposition thinking they were preventing 
the reelection of Menem. I think Menem and Alfonsin are cut from 
the same cloth; they have the same tendencies toward personalism 
and political hegemonism." 
  But at the center left, there are discordant voices. Santa 
Fe 
Deputy Guillermo Estevez Boero, a Popular Socialist, says, "The 
dialogue between Menem and Alfonsin is positive, because it 
establishes a methodology that can overcome conflicts and 
political disagreements." 
  In any case, Estevez Boero warned that his party will not be 
left out. "The legitimacy of this procedure," he declared, "will 
depend on going beyond the limited, two-party perspective." 
  In New York, where he is attending a seminar, Peronist 
Senator Jose Octavio Bordon indicated that the reform agreement 
"is on the right track for the consensus that I have always 
called for. We have moved a step forward." Despite the pressure, 
Bordon opposed the government's plan to amend the Constitution, 
which has now been tabled in the wake of the Olivas summit. 
  "I am much more in favor," he added, "because I also think 
that the text will be much more limited, will inspire more 
confidence, and will better serve Argentines." 
  There were other opinions as well: 

  -  Party of Liberation: "We urge the people to reject the 
Menem-Alfonsin conspiracy, which will pave the way for Menem's 
reelection, and thus for the continuation of this economic 
policy." 
  -  Movement Toward Socialism: "The Menem-Alfonsin pact, 
signed behind the workers' backs, is designed to strengthen the 
institutions of this pro-business regime. They are scheming to 
continue applying the hunger plan." 
  -  Order and Justice Party: "A 
serious attack on legality has been perpetrated by the two top 
leaders of the Radical and Peronist parties. The agreement to 
reform the Constitution is equivalent to a white coup 
d'etat." 
  -  Workers Party: "The pact between Menem and Alfonsin is 
antidemocratic. Its sole purpose is to boost the reelection of 
the current privatist clique, in response to the demands of 
international creditors and big business in this country."

  [Text] If the bipartisan agreement is still alive after 
going through an obstacle course that includes the biggest 
hurdle of all, the 3 December Radical Convention, and then the 
parliamentary debate, the law permitting the Constitution to be 
amended will be enacted. The part of the Constitution that 
states its postulates and dogma will remain untouched, however. 
  The pact signed by Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin, according 
to its most enthusiastic defenders, will ensure, "for the first 
time in Argentina, a representative, democratic, and historic 
Constituent Assembly." This future assembly, say those who are 
negotiating the basic premises of the reform, has "legal and 
political" guarantees that previous ones lacked. 
  According to the text approved by the Senate on 21 
September, 
the delegates to the Constituent Assembly will be elected by the 
D'Hont system of proportional representation. Each province and 
the Federal Capital will elect a number of delegates equal to 
the total number of legislators it sends to the Congress of the 
Nation, and in the same proportion: 303 members all together. 
  The requirements for being a delegate are the same as those 
for being a national deputy. Any public official may go to the 
Constituent Assembly, except for members of the judiciary. The 
delegates will enjoy the same privileges and receive the same 
expense allowance as legislators, from the day they are elected 
to the date the assembly concludes. 
  As for duration, the Senate draft says that the assembly 
will 
begin work within 60 days of the election of delegates, and must 
complete its work within 120 days, with no extensions. 
  The senators also want the assembly to be held in the Entre 
Rios city of Parana. Although the final word has not been said 
on this matter, the provincial deputies from Santa Fe, for 
example, at the insistence of the Progressive Democrats, 
approved a draft Thursday requesting the National Congress to 
put the assembly in their jurisdiction. They argue that the 
province has a historic right to host the assembly: the 
Constitution of 1853 was drafted there. 
<H5>  Step by Step </H5>
  After Congress passes the law calling for reform, elections 
will be held to elect delegates to the assembly, although no 
date has been set. The timing of the elections depends, among 
other things, on the duration of the tug-of-war between the 
negotiators of the Justicialist Party (PJ) and the Radical Civic 
Union (UCR). 
  Alberto Garcia Lema, counsel to the Treasury and a member of 
the PJ drafting team that has been working on the wording of the 
reform pact, says that "if things keep going the way they have 
been so far," the election of delegates will take place in 
January, February "at the latest." The vacation will be spiced 
up by a short election campaign. In March (or April), the 
Constituent Assembly will begin its work. 
  After it has been convened for a fixed date, the assembly 
must decide how it is going to operate. Constitutionalist 
Ricardo Monner Sans indicates that "all constituent assemblies 
have regulated themselves. In other words, they elect their own 
officers according to their own criteria; they decide on 
internal regulations, the operation of committees, and what kind 
of committees they will have." 
  He gives examples: The 1949 assembly, for example, elected 
Col. Domingo Mercante chairman pursuant to a decision by the 
Justicialist bloc. At the 1957 assembly, however, Socialist 
Nicolas Repetto was elected because he was the oldest delegate. 
  The schedule will be as follows: 

  -  Election of officers and approval of provisional rules of 
procedure. This will be done at one or more so-called 
"preparatory" meetings. 
  -  Approval of rules of procedure. This 
will be done at the first plenary session of the assembly, which 
may also involve several meetings. 
  -  Formation of committees. 
There were three committees in the 1957 Constituent Assembly: 
Powers and Regulations, Drafting, and General Business. In the 
1949 assembly there was also a Constitutional Revision 
Committee. One of the tasks of the Powers Committee is to 
identify how many members each committee will have and what its 
mandate will be. 
  -  Plenary-session debates on constitutional 
amendments. During these debates, delegates will speak 
individually, but in the name of the party delegations. 
  -  Voting 
on the new Constitution. At this point, the assembly may also 
pass a number of transitory provisions that will indicate, for 
example, how the the oaths of allegiance to the new basic law 
will be administered. 
  -  The assembly delegates will swear 
allegiance to the new Constitution. 
  -  The oath will be repeated by 
the top authorities of all the branches of government. The first 
to swear allegiance will be the president of the nation, who 
will then administer the oath to the cabinet ministers. The 
presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies will also 
take the oath, and will then administer it to all 
legislators. 

    With respect to the judiciary, the transitory provisions 
approved by the Constituent Assembly of 1949 provided for the 
reappointment of the Supreme Court and all judges. The legality 
of their terms was suspended, because the new Constitution 
revamped the entire justice system. 
  According to the draft now being discussed, the Constituent 
Assembly does not have sovereignty. It can, however, reject the 
reforms proposed by Congress, although in no case can it carry 
out reforms, repeals, or additions that have not been specified 
by Parliament in its passage of the law calling for 
constitutional reform and setting forth the sections to be 
amended. 
  It is clear to everyone that this is a key issue, because if 
the Constituent Assembly were declared sovereign, it would 
acquire the range of an eagle. Radical Deputy Jorge Vanossi, who 
is a constitutional specialist, believes that the Constituent 
Assembly "cannot be a mere echo of Congress." Even though the 
Menem-Alfonsin pact guarantees a consensual reform, "not all 
assembly delegates will give their unquestioning approval." 
  The last election of Constituent Assembly delegates was in 
1957, and it was called by the military regime that in September 
1955 had overthrown the government of Juan Domingo Peron. It is 
true that that year the delegates were elected under the D'Hont 
system for the first time in Argentina, which allowed small 
groups (such as the Communist Party and the Labor Party) to be 
represented. But Peronism was prohibited, and the vast majority 
of Peron supporters cast blank ballots. 
<H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5>
<H5>  X-Ray of the Constituent Assembly </H5>
<H5>  How It Is Elected </H5>

  -  Voting is mandatory and by secret ballot. All Argentine 
citizens over the age of 18 can vote. 
  -  As in legislative 
elections, the voters choose a slate of assembly delegates by 
party. 

<H5>    Who May Be a Delegate </H5>

  -  Any a native-born or naturalized Argentine citizen over 
the age of 25 may be listed on the slate of candidates. 
  -  Each 
delegate must represent a party, as either a member or a 
nonmember. 
  -  As in deputy elections, each province elects its 
delegates. 
  -  All public officials may be delegates, except for 
members of the judiciary. 
  -  The assembly will have 303 delegates, 
equal to the number of national deputies and 
senators. 
  -  Privileges: Assembly delegates will enjoy the same 
immunity as legislators, from the day they are elected to the 
end of their mandate. 
  -  Expense allowance: Delegates will receive 
the same allowance as legislators. 

<H5>    Inauguration, Duration, and Operation </H5>

  -  Session will open 60 days after the election of 
delegates. 
  -  Session will last 120 days. The assembly may conclude 
its deliberations prior to that time, but not after it. 
  -  Quorum: 
Half plus one of the delegates; but the assembly may adopt its 
own rules of procedure. 

<H5>    Powers </H5>

  -  The assembly is free to accept or reject the reforms 
proposed by Congress. 

    Note: The law to be passed by Congress calling for 
constitutional reform may modify some of these points. 
<H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5>
<H5>  It Is Written in History </H5>
  Since the Constitution of 1853 was enacted, seven 
Constituent 
Assemblies have been convened, although only five were actually 
held: in 1860, 1866, 1898, 1949, and 1957. 
  Radical deputy and constitutionalist Jorge Vanossi wrote in 
the magazine TODO ES HISTORIA [Everything Is History] that the 
1860 Constituent Assembly (held in Santa Fe) "formalized and 
made viable" the incorporation of the "State" of Buenos Aires 
into the "State" of the Argentine Nation. 
  Between 1853 and that year, two entities with different 
territories, populations, and governments existed side by side: 
the Argentine Confederation, which was governed by the 
Constitution of 1853, and the State of Buenos Aires, which was 
governed by its own Constitution of 1854. 
  The Constituent Assembly of 1866 (also held in Santa Fe) 
introduced a partial amendment to Article 4 of the Constitution, 
which dealt with export duties. "No official record of that 
assembly's deliberations remains," says Vanossi. 
  In 1898, this time in the Federal Capital, another assembly 
was held to make partial amendments to the Constitution. 
  In 1949, Congress passed a law declaring that "the revision 
and reform of the National Constitution" were necessary "in 
order to eliminate, modify, add, and correct its provisions to 
better defend the rights of the people and the welfare of the 
nation." It was, in fact, a total reform, and among other things 
it led to the reelection of Juan Domingo Peron in 1951. 
  That election of assembly delegates followed the provisions 
of the Saenz Pena Act, which provided for a majority and a 
single minority. The UCR, the minority, left the site of the 
assembly claiming that the convocation of the Constituent 
Assembly was "legally nonexistent." 
  The military government of Gen. Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, 
which 
overthrew Juan Peron in September 1955, convened another 
Constituent Assembly in 1957. 
  With Peronism banned and Radicalism divided into two 
factions, the UCR of the People led by Ricardo Balbin and the 
Intransigent Radical Civic Union (UCRI) led by Arturo Frondizi, 
the assembly merely reflected the profound divisions in 
Argentine society. 
  The UCRI, which was the political group with the most 
delegates in the assembly, showed up for the sole purpose of 
impugning the assembly. Having achieved that objective, it left 
the assembly hall. A few days later, several representatives of 
the UCR of the People also left. Finally, a dozen conservative

  [Text] The Permanent Commission of the Episcopate yesterday 
urged those responsible for constitutional reform to make their 
intentions and procedures transparent so that the future 
constitution will be the product of a social pact. The bishops 
criticized the conditions being imposed on some branches of 
government and asserted that this pressure is also undermining 
the legitimacy of the future constitution. The Church's 
pronouncement topped a tension-filled day on which one Supreme 
Court justice repelled an attack by President Menem, who in 
Tokyo had called for his resignation, and the retirement of 
another justice of the court was postponed indefinitely. The 
Supreme Court handed down a judgment declaring that a 
Constituent Assembly cannot have unlimited powers. 
  The Catholic Church affirmed yesterday that the efforts made 
so far to bring about constitutional reform are characterized by 
"conditions imposed on the constituent branches of government 
that compromise their actions," which "threatens the legitimacy 
and permanence of a future constitution." The Church's position 
was publicized in a document released yesterday at the 
conclusion of deliberations by the Permanent Commission of the 
Episcopate. 
  The bishops exhorted those responsible for the 
constitutional 
reform process "to make their intentions, motives, and 
procedures transparent so that the constitution that emerges 
will be the expression of a true social pact." 
  Without mentioning the protagonists, but alluding to the 
pressures the executive branch has exerted on Congress and the 
judiciary, among other issues, the bishops' communique mentioned 
the political coercion that took place on Tuesday with the 
removal of the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Antonio 
Boggiano, and on Wednesday with the resignation of Justice 
Rodolfo Barra. 
  Yesterday's is the first official document issued by the 
Catholic Church regarding the constitutional reform, and it 
comes more than three months before the opinion of the Church is 
expected to be made public. The first draft of that document is 
being prepared by a committee chaired by Cardinal Raul 
Primatesta. 
  In just 35 lines, the Episcopate sums up ecclesiastical 
displeasure with the current negotiations on the reform. After 
mentioning the conditions imposed on the branches of government, 
the document points out that they also compromise "the 
responsibility of the legislators, the stability of the judges, 
and even the legitimacy and permanence of the future 
constitution." 
  The bishops briefly praised the political dialogue, and then 
focused on the formal aspect of the reform negotiations 
undertaken by the Justicialist Party (PJ) and the Radical Civic 
Union (UCR). The Permanent Commission is an entity chaired by 
Cardinal Quarracino that makes decisions in representation of 
the plenary assembly. 
  The statement shows signs of the internal debate that is 
going on in the Church. This controversy was not apparent at the 
October assembly, when the bishops merely described the basic 
dogmatic themes without alluding to any current issues. 
  The statement of 27 October noted that "the Constitution 
itself governs the procedures for its eventual reform" at a time 
when the political cauldron was boiling because the government 
was trying to move forward with the amendment of the 
Constitution with just two-thirds of the members present in 
Congress. 
  The Olivos accord between President Carlos Menem and Radical 
leader Raul Alfonsin forced the committee headed by Primatesta 
to rethink its position. The committee, also made up of Bishops 
Emilio Bianchi Di Carcano (Azul), Jose Maria Arancedo (Mar del 
Plata), and Juan Carlos Maccarone (Lomas de Zamora), decided to 
release part of the draft early. 
  Signals also came from other prelates, such as Edgardo 
Storni, archbishop of Santa Fe, who termed the agreement between 
Menem and Alfonsin on constitutional reform "unethical." "The 
only goal is reelection, and to achieve it, they throw out 
crumbs of power to maintain themselves as the political class," 
said Storni in a harsh tone not usually heard in Church 
officials. 
  Yesterday's statement from the bishops recalled that "any 
agreement should be a step forward, and should in and of itself 
mean the creation of a propitious environment for a fruitful 
debate on the issues involved in the common good and the 
requirements for true democracy." 
  This first official opinion on the reform from the episcopal 
leadership contends that "the Argentine people are not very 
familiar with the reform proposals or their motivations," and 
that, on the other hand, "they desire a decent future in a 
united society." The document also states that the desire for 
reform "should not distract government officials or the governed 
from daily attention to the tasks that ensure life and the 
quality of life for all inhabitants." 
  Another thrust, this one aimed at emphasizing that "the 
leaders' political skill must be supported by exemplary ethical 
standards, which become more and more necessary as the 
consequences of their decisions become more serious for the 
country."

<F P=106> [Article by correspondent Ana Ale] </F>
  [Text] The 104 compressed natural gas (GNC) stations 
belonging to the Italian General Petroleum Agency (AGIP) have 
been purchased by Government Oil Deposits (YPF). The 
transaction, which also includes the firm that markets gas in 
canisters for the Italian subsidiary, totaled $60 million. YPF 
now controls 48 percent of the automotive gas market. 
  Market sources have known about it for several weeks, but 
the 
confirmation came from the buyer: YPF admitted having bought the 
chain of compressed natural gas service stations put up for sale 
by AGIP six months ago. 
  The transaction cost the mixed petroleum enterprise $60 
million, much more than the other companies were willing to pay. 
They were left in disappointment when YPF's hefty offer was made 
known in Italy. 
  With the absorption of the 104 service stations operated by 
AGIP throughout the nation, YPF now dominates the GNC market, 
which is still booming thanks to the policy of replacing liquid 
fuel in motor vehicles. 
  The development brings relief to AGIP, a subsidiary of the 
state-run Ente Nazionale de Hidrocarburi (ENI). Like the rest of 
ENI, it is feeling the sting of the Italian corruption scandals, 
which in this case set off a privatization plan. The 
privatization of AGIP was carried out with the consultation of 
the Swiss banking industry. 
  ENI has been selling off all its possessions in Argentina, 
including a 4,200-hectare field in Entre Rios valued at $3.8 
million. YPF decided to forego this asset; although it does want 
to expand, it will continue devoting itself exclusively to the 
hydrocarbon business. The company, led by Jose Estenssoro, was 
more attracted to the other goods that were being sold. 
  There are two ways of profiting on this new property: on the 
canister market, and through the marketing of GNC. In these two 
areas, AGIP was fairly active in Argentina. 
  It accounted for 26 percent of GNC sales, a third of total 
spending on gas in canisters. In addition, it had 12 automated 
bottling plants to put gas in cylinders and canisters, valve 
maintenance shops that operated under the name Comsergas, and a 
fleet of trucks. 
  "The deal is closed," sources at YPF said. Argentine AGIP 
will now be called YPF Gas S.A., and will be devoted to the 
bottling, distribution, and marketing of liquefied petroleum gas 
(in containers) and compressed natural gas, according to the 
official communique. The oil company paid "$60 million (for 100 
percent of the AGIP stock package), subject to adjustments under 
the terms of the contract," adds the press release on YPF 
stationery. 
  "When do you take possession of the property?" CLARIN asked 
officials at Estenssoro's company, in which the state is a 
20-percent shareholder. 
  "In the next few days, by next week for sure." 
  [CLARIN] Have you already paid? 
  [Answer] I do not have that information. 
  [CLARIN] Was the payment in cash? 
  [Answer] I do not know that, either. 
  The fact that few statements can be obtained aside from 
documents sent to the commodity exchange is par for the course, 
now that the largest company in Argentina has been privatized. 
But the privatization of AGIP followed a similar pattern. 
  All those interested in the Italian properties had to keep 
their lips sealed regarding the transaction. Those who responded 
to the call of the Swiss banks received a booklet with the basic 
figures concerning the operations of the firm established by 
Enrico Mattei (father of ENI) after World War II. They were 
sworn to silence with respect to the content of the booklet. 
  Some of those initially interested were turned off by the 
nature of the sale. It was not an adjudication in the Argentine 
tradition, which, in the best of cases, is defined as a 
highest-bidder transaction. ENI studied the offers and decided 
on the winner a piacere [at its whim]. 
  They were also displeased with the prices that began to be 
mentioned: In Rome there was talk of figures as high as 100 
million pesos. Small oil companies were not willing to pay more 
than 40 million for the entire package. 
  Before an official offer was made, Astra, Puma (Soldati 
Group), and even Shell, which had made initial overtures, 
withdrew from the bidding. It came down to the home stretch, and 
Argon, one of the three A's (along with AGIP and Autogas) that 
monopolize the canister market, faced defeat. So, reportedly, 
did Sol Petroleo, a small company that sells gas and also 
distills solvents. 
  But YPF beat them hands down. Estenssoro had his heart set 
on 
annexing the AGIP infrastructure. The goal is to turn the GNC 
stations into dual stations that can also sell gasoline, which 
would give it a better edge in the fuel market that YPF, Shell, 
and Esso are competing for. With an additional investment of 
between $80,000 and $100,000 per station, it will add to its 
arsenal the outlets acquired from AGIP in the Capital and in 
Greater Buenos Aires. To round out its strategy, all it needs to 
do is persuade the station managers to exchange the yellow AGIP 
sign for the light blue YPF sign. 
<H5>  [Box, p 20] </H5>
<H5>  Disturbing Growth </H5>
  Domingo Cavallo was upset by the idea. Just when the Economy 
Ministry is trying to do something to combat the oligopolistic 
practices in fuel sales, YPF strengthens its position in the GNC 
market with the purchase of AGIP, which gives it a 48 percent 
share. 
  His closest aides even discussed ways of suggesting that YPF 
pull out of the deal. But YPF is run by Jose Estenssoro, the 
executive president who acts on behalf of the D-class (private) 
shareholders. And while the state still holds 20 percent of the 
shares, that amount bears no weight when it comes to making 
operational decisions, which in many cases are reported to the 
rest of the board of directors after they have already been made. 
  Now YPF also has the edge in the GNC market, where sales 
have 
multiplied several thousand times in less than eight years. On 
the other markets, it was already number one: In gasoline and 
gasoil, it leads all other companies; it controls more than half 
of the oil and gas reserves and production facilities, as well 
as distilling capacity. 
  In the private management of YPF, what matters most is 
showing good results to the stockholders on the inside, and the 
more numerous ones on the outside. For this reason, the addition 
of the AGIP sales network will enable it to compete better and 
with fewer outlays: All it will have to do is add hoses for 
gasoline and gasoil to the existing GNC connections. 
  Since the oil company will retain the management of the 
stations located in the Capital and Greater Buenos Aires (those 
in the interior will be subject to private management and 
credit), it may show a new face soon, with the more modern 
facilities that AGIP operated. This will cost less than 
upgrading the stations connected to the YPF network. 
  For the Economy Ministry, this is less a matter of business 
than of strategic considerations. The problem arises when the 
international prices of crude oil fluctuate, while Argentine 
gasoline prices act as if nothing had happened. 
  This occurred a few months ago, and in addition to the 
finger-pointing and momentary anger at YPF, Shell, and Esso, it 
prompted a petition filed with the defense council that deals 
with these matters. The petition was based on allegations of 
oligopolistic management, and it is not known what the ruling 
was. 
  Paving the way for more effective control, the draft of the 
new hydrocarbon law contains a chapter providing severe 
penalties for monopolistic or oligopolistic practices. Under 
this system of enforcement, YPF is in for closer scrutiny.

  [Text] Former Minister Antonio Britto is the favorite 
candidate to represent the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party] in the presidential race. A survey conducted yesterday 
by Datafolha among party leaders and Senate and Chamber of 
Deputies party bloc members reveals that 35 percent of PMDB 
followers questioned want the party to support Britto in the 
presidential race. Former Governor Orestes Quercia came a 
distant second with barely 10 percent of the votes. 
  The survey conducted during a PMDB leadership meeting in 
Brasilia confirms the supposition that Quercia dominates the 
party apparatus. During an interview with FOLHA last weekend, 
Quercia indicated his candidacy and ruled out Britto's chances: 
  "It is too soon for him," Quercia said. 
  The survey shows that his party does not think so. 
  Nearly 100 PMDB leaders attended the meeting yesterday. 
Datafolha questioned 72 of them. The numbers reveal more bad 
news for Quercia: Senator Pedro Simon (RS) [Rio Grande So Sul] 
appears in third place with 6 percent support, only 4 points 
below the former Sao Paulo governor. Simon is Quercia's 
arch-enemy and will work better with Britto. When we add the 
percentages obtained by Britto and Simon, we can see that the 
two candidates are preferred by 41 percent of PMDB leaders. 
  Sharing third place with Simon is Goias Governor Iris 
Rezende, also with 6 percent. Rezende is an old friend of 
Quercia but is undecided on who he will support. Next in the 
list (with 3 percent) is Parana Governor Roberto Requiao, 
another enemy of Quercia. Next, with a mere 1 percent are 
former President Jose Sarney, Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury 
Filho, and Deputy Odacir Klein -- the Congressional 
Investigating Committee vice president.

  [Text] Recife -- After admitting that he will leave the 
government to run for the presidency, Finance Minister Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso began his campaign and selected PT [Workers 
Party] candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva as his target. He 
accused Lula of not having a consistent program for Brazil. The 
minister believes Lula will not achieve the presidency and 
warned that a PT government "would ruin many good things," as 
happened in the [former President Fernando] Collor government. 
  "I cannot see Lula's proposal. What kind of model does the 
PT want for Brazil? Everything is very confusing, very 
ambiguous. Is it going to be a big Nicaragua? A Cuba? There 
is nothing," the minister said. 
  Cardoso made his attack against Lula on the night of 15 
January when, after distributing food to those suffering from 
the drought in the interior of Pernambuco State, he continued 
with his agenda as a candidate with the recording of a radio 
program. The minister tried to indicate that he does not fear a 
confrontation with Lula, and he even minimized the PT 
candidate's popularity, stressing that poll results do not have 
very much significance. 
  Regarding the support given to Lula during the 1989 
campaign, 
Cardoso indicated that that was another time, and that the PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] considers the PT's program 
incompatible. He stated that he had decided to support Lula 
only in the second round because he did not want to vote for the 
right and also in view of the electorate's demands. 
  "It is not that Lula is an evil person. The trouble is that 
he does not have a program." 
  Cardoso again admitted the hypothesis of running for 
president and that he considers it absurd that some groups 
already have given up on him as a candidate because they believe 
he should remain at the head of the Finance Ministry in order to 
supervise the economic stabilization program. He admitted that 
at this time there is no sense in discussing candidacies; he 
stressed that he is concentrating on the task of stabilizing the 
economy and that he is certain he is acting responsibly. 
  "None of my actions have been motivated by the idea of 
becoming a candidate. What I refuse to say is that I have to 
reject the idea if the plan is successful. My political rights 
were taken away from me by the military. Are my political 
rights going to be taken away from me because I can achieve 
success? I do not play with that type of demagogy," he warned. 
  Before participating in the radio program, the minister had 
a 
closed meeting with Deputies Roberto Freire (PPS [People's 
Socialist Party]), Maurilio Ferreira Lima (PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party]), and Jarbas Vasconcelos (PMDB), the 
mayor of Recife. The meeting served to smooth over the 
disagreements, which had worsened with the attrition that led 
Freire to leave the government leadership in the Chamber of 
Deputies, between the minister and Freire. An alliance between 
the PSDB, PMDB, and the PPS also was discussed. The minister 
also took the opportunity to inform himself about the election 
climate in Pernambuco, and he expressed his support for Jarbas 
Vasconcelos in his bid for the state's governorship. 
  The minister also met with PSDB militants and once again 
explained how the fight against inflation is being carried out. 
At PSDB headquarters, Cardoso met a group of government 
officials fired during the Collor government, and he was booed 
when he reaffirmed the position of Planalto Palace regarding the 
vetoing of the draft bill that guarantees the re-hiring of fired 
government officials.

Contreiras, Fabio Sanches, and Bianca Alves] 
  [Text] It is 1979: the largest strike since the 1964 coup 
paralyzes the metallurgical industry of Sao Bernardo do Campo 
(SP) [Sao Paulo State] under the leadership of lathe operator 
Luis Inacio Silva or Lula. The military government treats the 
strike as a police (or Army) case and Lula as a criminal. 1989: 
the military establishment mobilizes against the victory of Lula 
as presidential candidate of the PT [Workers Party]. 1994: 
leader in the polls for the October elections, Lula already has 
the sympathy -- or at least the tolerance -- of important 
sectors of the Armed Forces, from the high command to the 
recruits. And the PT returns the courtesy by starting to put 
aside old dogmas such as the end of mandatory military service 
and the Calha Norte Project that foresees a greater Brazilian 
military presence in the Amazon. For the PT leadership, the 
rapprochment with the military seems worth the risk of greater 
internal disagreements when those who longed for the historic 
program begin to criticize the dissidents. Just the same, the 
military hard-liners do not trust the PT's softer stand and are 
working on the candidacy of former high-ranking conservative 
officers. The objective is to transfer the votes for the 
military candidate to Lula's adversaries in the presidential 
race. 
  The PT letter of introduction for debating with the military 
is a defense program draft project that was entrusted to Colonel 
Geraldo Cavagnari, retired, director of strategic studies at the 
University of Campinas. The PT leadership has not yet approved 
the document entitled Defense Policy and the Armed Forces which 
is based on a position shared by the Brazilian high command. The 
document says: "Regarding external defense, if war is justified, 
the Armed Forces cannot react quickly and do not have the 
operational capabilities to allow an appropriate and effective 
response." In conclusion, Cavagnari defends the creation of a 
Defense Ministry enclosing the four military institutions, 
keeping the mandatory military service in addition to a 
voluntary service, reequipping the Armed Forces, and continuing 
strategic projects such as the Calha Norte Project, the nuclear 
submarine project, the space mission, and the AMX fighter. The 
most important proposal, and the most controversial, is the 
enlargement of the military budget, from the current 0.5 percent 
to 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Four times more. 
Oddly enough, two days before finishing his project and soon 
after the cries of the high command in December prevented the 
budget cuts included in the economic plan of Finance Minister 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Cavagnari in an interview with ISTOE 
defended increasing the military budget from 0.5 to 0.75 
percent. The cries of the military against the restrictions 
Cardoso wanted to impose on their budget also encouraged the 
approval on 4 January of a line of credit of $800 million for 
the next four years for the purchase of Army equipment. 
  The PT wing in charge of the main contacts with the military 
is known as "the two Joses." They are Sao Paulo Federal Deputies 
Jose Genoino and Jose Dirceu who in some way are counterparts of 
the generals and brigadiers because they participated with the 
guerrillas against the military regime in the 1970's. Genoino is 
a veteran in this type of contact but his position in a minority 
group within the party has somewhat tarnished his star. Dirceu 
is known for coordinating some kind of PT information service. 
Another PT expert on military matters is Minister Secretary of 
Strategic Affairs Mario Cesar Flores whose alias is Admiral. 
Flores, who is often mentioned as the man to head a military 
ministry under a PT administration, dismisses that by saying: 
"It is just foolish speculation. There was never any contact." 
It is known, however, that his friend Jose Genoino is the main 
spokesman in Congress for Flores' proposal for reforming the 
information services. 
  The officers' overriding concern in their talks with the PT 
leaders is to know exactly who will be at the wheel within the 
government if Lula is successful at the polls, since the most 
leftist factions control the political party machine. A party 
leader contends that "the commanders even accept the 
establishment of a Defense Ministry, but are of the opinion that 
putting an end to mandatory military service would lower the 
quality of their cadres." It is within the Navy and the Air 
Force that the PT finds itself more at ease to sail and fly. As 
an influential PT leader says, "they are indeed against 
authoritarian regimes because their activities largely hinge on 
technological development, which dictatorial governments end up 
by holding in check." Lula and his followers perceive that the 
greatest troubles are to be found in the Army. Besides small 
groups such as Our Homeland [Patria Nossa], from Rio de Janeiro, 
or Fiend [Anhanguera], from Goias, the PT has pinpointed a 
nucleus of hard-liners grouped around former Army Minister 
[under Jose Sarney, 1989-1991] General Leonidas Pires Goncalves. 
This nucleus allegedly includes General Benedito Leonel, the 
Army chief of staff, who during the crisis that erupted due to 
cutbacks in the military budget was the one who sounded a note 
of warning about the danger of the "wrath of the legions." "The 
PT candidate is not an utter disaster, but does not have any 
administrative experience," says Gen. Pires. 
  Dirceu and Genoino frequent the world of the military with a 
view to accomplishing two things -- discussing issues directly 
with high- ranking officers, thus bypassing established 
procedures in military hierarchy -- which makes the military's 
hair stand on end -- and leaving Lula out of these contacts so 
as to dispel the idea that the PT is knocking at barracks' 
doors. Dirceu states that "neither the PT nor the other 
political parties can politicize the Armed Forces, which are, 
and ought to continue to be, professional." All the contacts 
are made with the utmost secrecy. As the rapprochement with the 
military is a volatile issue, it is feared that rumors of a 
self-inflicted coup d'etat by Lula -- similar to the one 
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori spearheaded in 1992 -- will 
be bruited about in order to tie the parliamentary opposition 
hand and foot to prevent a possible PT government. 
  The breaking of that confidentiality law about the 
rapprochement with the military earned Genoino and Sao Paulo 
Deputy Aloiso Mercadante a stern rebuke from their colleagues 
last December. Genoino did not try to conceal a visit he made to 
[Strategic Affairs Secretary] Admiral [Mario] Flores to discuss 
the constitutional reform. Mercadante, on his part, showed to 
Army Minister General Zenildo de Lucena the evidence obtained by 
the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] proving 
the involvement of leading firms of building contractors in the 
budget scandal. 
  A general of the Army Staff who asked not to be identified 
told ISTOE that "there is no mutual sympathy in the 
rapprochement between the PT and the military. It is pure 
pragmatism." "It is absolutely normal for the presidential 
candidate of a party whose relations with the Armed Forces have 
always been difficult to begin his campaign by calming us and by 
trying to please us," added a colonel holding a high post at the 
Secretariat of Strategic Affairs. "No one has talked as much 
with the military as Tancredo Neves did," he concluded. 
Historian Selma Rocha, who is preparing a master's degree thesis 
entitled "The Brazilian Army Thought, 1964-1984," to be 
submitted at the USP [University of Sao Paulo] School of 
History, has another opinion. "Things have changed, because in 
previous decades both leftist and rightist sectors sought to 
attack the military. PT members seem to be willing, for the 
first time, to make society debate on the subject and control 
the Armed Forces," she said. Army spokesman General Gilberto 
Serra made a drier remark. "The PT has merely realized our 
problems the way no other party has, but it is not an ally, just 
like no party is. Perhaps it is the PT which needs us as 
allies," he said. 
  The facts of the matter are that now that the cold war is 
over, except in some areas, the PT no longer appears in the eyes 
of the military as the virus of the red danger. "We are not 
concerned about ideological or party matters but about the 
efficiency of the institution," said Colonel Luiz Henrique 
Pirez, professor of the Army Command and General Staff School 
(ECEME) of Rio de Janeiro, at which generals are trained. 
Supreme Militry Tribunal president Brigadier Cherubim Rosa Filho 
has said that "one of the factors that draws the PT and the 
military close is that neither military officers nor PT 
lawmakers are involved in the corruption scandals." He even 
supported the bill submitted by PT Deputy for Sao Paulo Helio 
Bicudo, ruling that regular courts should adjudicate the crimes 
committed by the military against civilians. 
  The Superior Military School [ESG] itself, which at other 
times was a center for training conservative cadres, is already 
considering the possibility of Lula being elected. Says an ESG 
document: "The most probable situation, which was chosen because 
it is the most probable -- though not the most desirable -- is 
an election that will put a leftist candidate in power through a 
consensus that will include the following sectors: the largest 
industrial entrepreneurs, the Armed Forces, civil organizations, 
Congress, etc." The ESG stated that this alliance will cause a 
conflict between Lula and the PT leadership. 
  ESG officers, with whom several PT members have engaged in 
debates over the past few years ("Interest on the subject was 
second only to the debates with Herbert de Souza, also known as 
Betinho, the coordinator of the program against starvation," as 
an officer put it), are other channels for contacts between the 
PT leadership and the barracks. In this case, the PT 
interlocutors are Rio de Janeiro state leader Cesar Queiroz 
Benjamin, also known as "Cesinha," who is an ex-MR-8 guerrilla, 
and sociologist Marco Aurelio Garcia, who is a Unicamp [Campinas 
State University] professor and a former Troskyist leader. ESG 
and PT members will meet in February to debate on a common 
agenda of priorities. Cesinha has even sent a handwritten 
message to one of the officers who is organizing the meeting 
saying: "The idea to engage in a debate remains valid. It will 
be before the national PT meeting, and Lula has already said he 
liked the proposal very much. Greetings, Cesar." The message was 
accompanied by a gift of two books: one on the environment, and 
the other on the PT as an alternative leftist party. 
  The courtship between PT leaders and the military gained 
ground during the two months in which Luiza Erundina headed the 
Federal Administration Secretariat (SAF) last year. Erundina was 
considered the goddess of the military, because she supported 
their salary adjustment proposals. President Itamar Franco has 
even reportedly charged Erundina with "promoting agitation in 
the barracks." The command liked very much a decree drawn up by 
Erundina banning the transfer of operational military real 
estate properties, which former President Fernando Collor had 
put on the market. The military believed that transfer of the 
properties would paralyze the frequent transfers of contingents 
from one state to another. Within the SAF, there are comments 
that Itamar Franco reportedly designated General Romildo Canhim 
to replace Erundina, not because of Canihm's links with 
ex-president Sarney but to compensate the military for the loss 
of their goddess. 
  But the rapprochement between the PT camp and the military 
barracks is not all roses. Federal Deputy Jacques Wagner 
(PT-BA) [Bahia] has stated that "I do not like this babbling at 
all," adding that "the national party leadership is lurching 
toward a big brawl with party affiliates." Colonel Cavagnari's 
proposal to continue with the nuclear project (and the 
nuclear-powered submarine) has triggered the wrath of the green 
and ecologist faction within the PT, like Rio de Janeiro Deputy 
Carlos Minc. 
  The public employees lobby, which has a lot of influence 
inside the PT and the CUT [Sole Workers Center], does not accept 
military demands to do away with the salary equality policy. 
Federal Deputy Maria Laura (PT-DF) [PT-Federal District], public 
employees' standard-bearer, has promised to oppose any proposal 
to end salary equality. 
  While unhappy PT followers get ready to fight the party's 
defense program, military hard-liners start cleaning their 
sabers to oppose Lula. The hard-liners have the option of 
promoting the candidacy of prestigious reserve officers in many 
states [to legislative seats] and thus attracting the vote of 
the military toward Lula's presidential adversaries. In Rio de 
Janeiro, hard-liners are supporting General Euclydes Figueiredo 
(brother of former president Joao-Batista Figueiredo) and 
Colonel Pedro Rostey, from the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and 
General Nilton Cerqueira (PP) [Popular Party], president of the 
military club, to run for seats in the Chamber of Deputies. 
General Newton Cruz, also known as "Nini," wants to run for Rio 
de Janeiro's governorship but he still has not found a party 
willing to support him. Brigadier Ivan Frota will run against 
Rio Grande do Norte Deputy Flavio Rocha for the PL [Liberal 
Party] presidential nomination. In the Federal District those 
opposing Lula will concentrate their efforts on Colonel Kurt 
Pessek's candidacy while Goias' radical group Anhanguera will 
support Colonel Silesio Gusmao. 
  Hard-liners want to take the air out of Lula's campaign at 
the barracks and prevent the emergence of new leaders such as 
Captain and Deputy Jair Bolsonaro in Rio de Janeiro. Bolsonaro 
is not liked for having mobilized officers' families at the 
Military Village seeking better salaries. At this time Bolsonaro 
does not have a party to support his candidacy because Deputy 
Alvaro Valle vetoed his entry into the PL. "We recognized Lula 
as president-elect. We have studies showing he is winning," 
Bolsonaro said. Lula, who tried hard to keep a very low profile 
during the entire process of rapprochment with the military, has 
started to speak up. During an interview by THE NEW YORK TIMES 
on 27 December the PT candidate said: "The military are treating 
us as if we already were the next government." Former President 
Jose Sarney took advantage of the quote to ironically say: "If 
that is true he should begin taking classes on how to answer 
military salutes." We do not know anything about those classes, 
but Lula is undoubtedly flexing his muscles.

<F P=106> [Interview with Venezuelan President-elect Rafael Caldera by </F>
an unidentified reporter at the Supreme Court of Justice in 
Caracas; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Caldera] I understand that the budget is something 
that is quite important; nevertheless, it is not something that 
has priority status. There are other issues that are above 
financial considerations. 
  [Reporter] Do you then believe it is something related to 
moral values? 
  [Caldera] Fundamentally, all of the problems we are 
experiencing in the country originate from the moral crisis we 
have been confronting. 
  [Reporter] With respect to the reforms needed within the 
judicial branch, what are the initiatives you have proposed? 
  [Caldera] [words indistinct] 
  [Reporter] With respect to the reforms needed in the 
judicial 
branch, could you explain what your proposals will be? 
  [Caldera] Well, at this point in time it would be impossible 
to explain all of the reforms that have been proposed. It would 
be necessary to first start by reforming the Constitution. A 
general constitutional reform entails several proposals which, 
by the way, would include recommendations by Supreme Court Vice 
President Alirio Abreu Burelli -- recommendations similar to 
those made last year by Magistrate Josefina Calcano de Temeltas 
in an address in which she proposed the creation of a 
constitutional court. 
  In addition, there are numerous other opinions that include 
reforming the Constitution, laws, and related administrative 
orders. These proposals are currently being received favorably 
because of something that is quite true, and that is this: All 
Venezuelans are convinced that we are facing a very difficult 
situation. The next administration and government will face a 
very complicated situation, but it is necessary for us to begin 
now, because the moment is fundamental if we expect to reach the 
21st century under the best conditions for democracy. 
  [Reporter] In terms of the value-added tax [VAT], at this 
time there are eight annulment appeals that... 
  [Caldera, interrupting] There you go, dragging me into the 
VAT again! 
  [Reporter] Of course, this the issue the people are most 
interested in. 
  [Caldera] That is alright; it really does not matter. My 
position with respect to the VAT is quite clear. Now, I would 
not like to venture and express a judicial opinion at this time 
and place. Of course, out of respect for the Supreme Court of 
Justice, I am forced as a private citizen to... 
  [Reporter, interrupting] Mr. President, right now there are 
eight annulment appeals to repeal this bill. What can you say 
about this? 
  [Caldera] I can only say that this issue must be decided as 
quickly as the previous appeals were resolved. 
  [Reporter] What are your final proposals? 
  [Caldera] I am committed to struggling to eliminate the VAT 
in a way that will also reform the tax system, establish a tax 
on those groups that are living in better conditions and can 
afford to pay, and not increase the tax burden on the less 
privileged sectors. 
  [Reporter] Anyway, in your opinion, what actions should 
be... 
  [Caldera, interrupting] That is enough for now.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Venezuelan Central Bank] </F>
  [Text] The Venezuelan Central Bank [BCV], as part of its 
duties as a clearinghouse bank, has excluded Banco Latino, C.A. 
from the clearinghouse system. 
  The decision was made when Banco Latino's debit balance 
could 
not be paid on 12 January at the Chamber of Compensation's close 
of business due to a shortage of funds in its BCV account. As a 
result, the procedures established in Article 12 of the Chamber 
of Compensation's regulations had to be enforced. 
  Consequently, Banco Latino will cease to participate in the 
Chamber of Compensation System. The BCV has notified the 
Superintendency of Banks, Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund], the 
finance minister, and the president of the National Banking 
Council of its decision so each of them can do their duty in 
accordance with the law. 
  This case will be handled by the competent institutions, 
which will apply the new banking legislation, so the normal 
functioning of the financial system should not be affected. The 
BCV hopes this situation will be resolved in the most 
constructive manner by the appropriate bodies to guarantee the 
enforcement of the savings, payments, and financial intervention 
systems.

<F P=106> [Report by Ligia Moreno from "The News" newscast; monitored </F>
in progress] 
  [Text] ...he indicated that Banco Latino had been excluded 
from the clearinghouse system by the Central Bank of Venezuela 
on 13 January after Banco Latino was unable to pay off the debt 
balance of more than 4 billion bolivares by the clearinghouse's 
close of business on Wednesday, 12 January, due to insufficient 
funds in the deposit account at the bank of issue. That is why 
this institution resorted to the Simon Bolivar Center, whose 
representative is Engineer Cesar Rodriguez, governor of Caracas. 
  [Begin Rodriguez recording] Banco Latino and its board of 
directors know of the efforts made by the Simon Bolivar Center 
to pay off nearly 14 billion bolivares, including interest, a 
debt that is over 15 years old. I received the authorization 
from the Council of Ministers to make the payment at 1030 on 
Thursday, 13 January. I left Simon Bolivar Center at 1500, and 
it is possible that I may have arrived there a few minutes after 
1600 to sign the document and turn in the bonds, which the 
Central Bank knew had been delivered by the Finance Ministry a 
few hours before, meaning late in the afternoon on Wednesday, 12 
January. The situation is not, as some reports indicate, an 
operation in which the Simon Bolivar Center and I had the bonds 
for a long time. The Finance Ministry issued the bonds and 
sent them to the Central Bank only 20 hours earlier. The 
finance minister, a member of the assembly at the Simon Bolivar 
Center, wanted this operation to be approved by the president in 
a Council of Ministers meeting. As you can see, the operation 
was carried out after the bonds were received. It was an 
operation that lasted less than 24 hours. All efforts that 
could be made were made. I was really surprised to see that an 
institution as strong as this, one of the largest banks in the 
country -- the second largest in the country in deposits -- was 
about to collapse just because the president of the Simon 
Bolivar Center got there a minute early or a minute late. [end 
recording] 
  The Superintendency of Banks, however, took over bank duties 
with all the powers of administration, management, control, and 
surveillance, including all powers granted by the law in these 
cases, after the government's announcement to shut the doors of 
Banco Latino was made. 
  [Begin recording] [Presidency Secretary Ramon Espinoza] We 
want to find the means to protect the public's savings accounts 
and finally guarantee that savings account holders can have 
access to their money as soon as possible. 
  [Superintendent of Banks Roger Urbina] The 
government-apppointed administrator will have a 90-day term to 
conduct the audits that will allow them to determine the precise 
financial status of Banco Latino. Based on this report, all the 
neccessary measures will be taken to sell the bank to private 
national or foreign investors in an effort to keep the 
institution working. According to the financial mechanisms 
established in the bank laws, Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund -- 
Fondo de Garantia de Depositos] will contribute resources to 
Banco Latino so its clients can begin withdrawing from their 
savings accounts as soon as possible according to the procedures 
determined by the government-appointed administrator, which will 
be announced at the proper time. In this program, priority will 
be given to small savings account holders. At any rate, it is 
important to note that Fogade guarantees deposits up to 1 
million bolivares according to Article 127 of the Bank Law. The 
Superintendency of Banks is also studying preventive measures 
for the remainder of the financial institutions that make up the 
Latino Group. [end recording] 
  Despite the announcement, Banco Latino issued a communique 
to 
the public because its president, Giacomo Leon, refused to speak 
to the media. In the communique, Banco Latino assures the 
nation of its willingness to respect the government's decision 
and to cooperate as much as possible in protecting the interests 
of those who have trusted in them for the last 43 years. 
  The institution thanks its personnel for their cooperation 
and hopes to overcome the problems faced by the banking 
institution caused by a criminal campaign of rumors that led to 
an excessive withdrawal of funds, which led to the subsequent 
closure of Banco Latino.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored by Panama 
Bureau through 17 January; source follows in parentheses after 
each item. 
  Health and Development Ministry sources reported on 11 
January that medicine prices will be controlled. Prices 
skyrocketed--some increased by 200 percent in certain 
cases--after the announcement of implementation of the value 
added tax. Prices will be set at December 1993 levels, 
following an agreement with pharmaceutical industry 
representatives. The government also placed 10 staple items 
under price control to prevent further speculation. (Paris AFP 
in Spanish 0054 GMT 12 Jan 94) 
  Venezuelan Petroleum, Petroven, plans to invest 140 billion 
bolivares in the refining field. The budget includes 120 
million bolivares, which will be channeled to the Amuay and 
Cardon Refineries. Gustavo Roosen, Petroven president, has 
announced that Venezuelan refineries have processed an average 
of 949,000 barrels per day. Amuay has 440,000 barrels, and 
Cardon processed 265,000 barrels per day. Investments in 
refining installations totaled 80 billion bolivares in 1993. 
(Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 13 Jan 94 p 14) 
  The Energy and Mines Ministry has reported that the mining 
industry has extracted products worth 74.8 billion bolivares, 
including gold, steel, diamonds, coal, bauxite, granite, marble, 
phosphate and other minerals. Steel topped the list with 33.4 
billion bolivares for its 20.5 million metric tons. Gold and 
diamonds each produced 9.1 billion bolivares; coal produced 
10.65 billion bolivares, and bauxite registered 5.83 billion 
bolivares. Foreign currency influx totaled $1.3 billion, while 
expenditures totaled $930 million. The difference, $384 
million, is a considerable increase over 1992's $93 million. 
(Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 13 Jan 94 p 14) 
  The government has reported paying 116 billion bolivares to 
the national debt. Finance Ministry officials have issued a 
report stating that 88.6 billion bolivares went to capital 
payment and the remainder went to interest and service payments. 
Despite the payment, the national debt grew by 84 million 
bolivares, however, to 219.579 billion bolivares. (Caracas EL 
GLOBO in Spanish 13 Jan 94 p 10) 
  Maraven, a subsidiary of Petroven, reported shipping 256.7 
million barrels of crude oil during 1993, of which 152 million 
barrels were shipped abroad, and 100 million barrels were sent 
to the Cardon Refinery. Despite repair and remodeling work at 
its Miranda Port facilities, the corporation has stated that it 
met its storage and shipping goals for the year. According to 
management spokespersons, this volume sets a record in the 
corporation's 34 years of operations. (Caracas EL GLOBO in 
Spanish 14 Jan 94 p 14) 
  Despite the weakening international oil market, the 
Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation has reported income of $2.5 
billion during 1993. Corpoven listed exports of 653,000 barrels 
per day of crude oil and refined products. Corpoven has 
announced that it had successfully managed to sell oxygenated 
gasolines to the demanding U.S. market, which made 1993 an 
especially productive year. (Caracas Venezolana de Television 
Network in Spanish 1550 GMT 14 Jan 94)

<F P=106> [Report by Aquileo Sanchez Viquez] </F>
  [Text] Four weeks before Costa Ricans wake up with a 
president-elect, the country's electoral situation does not yet 
allow a forecast of an undisputed winner for these elections. 
Had the elections been held during the previous week, however, 
Jose Maria Figueres [presidential candidate for the National 
Liberation Party, PLN] would have won with a 3-percent advantage 
over Miguel Angel Rodriguez [presidential candidate for the 
Social Christian Unity Party, PUSC]. 
  This is what we gather from the sixth weekly poll conducted 
by the Multispecialty Development Counselors (CID/Gallup) from 3 
to 6 January 1994, as part of the "1994 Electoral Campaign" 
series. The participants in this poll were 1,010 Costa Ricans 
from around the country, 510 interviewed in their homes and the 
rest via telephone. 
  The poll indicates that Costa Ricans are facing a campaign 
that is different from the others, as the personality of the 
candidates and their backgrounds are the focal point of the 
campaign, whereas ideas and programs have passed to second place 
in importance. 
<H5>  Distances Become Shorter </H5>
  The trend toward a near tie between Miguel Angel Rodriguez 
and Jose Maria Figueres, which prevailed in November, is 
repeated again in January, still with the opposition candidate 
in the lead. 
  When asking Costa Ricans for whom would they will vote if 
the 
elections were held today, 39.5 percent of the polled 
respondents gave their support to Figueres, while 35.5 percent 
supported Rodriguez. In that poll, 10.7 percent said they were 
undecided. 
  Upon asking that last group about their electoral 
inclination, should they be forced to choose, 4.6 percent said 
they favored the official candidate, and 3.6 percent favored the 
opposition candidate. 
  When these data are added, it turns out that the final vote 
inclination for Figueres is 43.1 percent, and for Rodriguez it 
is 40.1 percent. Regarding other preferences, Miguel Salguero 
of the Democratic Force Party got 4.1 percent; Jorge Gonzalez 
Marten of the National Independent Party, 0.6 percent; and other 
candidates, .6 percent. In the end, 3.4 percent remained 
undecided; 4.6 percent said they did not support any candidate, 
and 3.5 percent preferred not to respond. 
  We must cite that the poll has a margin of error of three 
points, more or less, which affects all the results; thus, the 
support for Figueres varies between 40.1 percent and 46.1 
percent, and the support for Rodriguez is between 37.1 percent 
and 43.1 percent. 
  Regarding the previous poll, which was published on 20 
December, Figueres' support dropped by 1.5 percent, whereas 
Rodriguez' increased by 1.3 percent. 
  The decrease in support for the green-and-whites [PUSC] is 
also observed when measuring the support for the political 
parties, as this week, the PLN has 45.8 percent of the followers 
while the PUSC has 37.3 percent. 
  In the previous survey, the Social Democratic Party 
garnered 47.5 percent of the votes, whereas the Social Christian 
Party got 38 percent. 
  The latest poll by Borge and Associates, conducted from 27 
to 
30 December, was also disclosed last week. The results put Jose 
Maria Figueres one point above Miguel Angel Rodriguez (41.6 
percent to 40.6 percent), although the PLN maintains a 
five-point lead over the ruling PUSC. 
  In terms of the political parties, the CID/Gallup studies 
indicate they have maintained the same level of support since 
August, when the first survey was taken following the June 
conventions. Figures shows that the gap between the candidates 
is narrowing, with Figueres dropping and Rodriguez gaining. 
Figueres enjoys the support of the majority of the electorate 
in the metropolitan area and voters less than 24 years old who 
have a secondary level education. Rodriguez, in turn, has the 
support of voters in the rest of the country, those less than 24 
years old who have at the most completed a primary level 
education and those who describe themselves as undecided. 
  By way of example, one has to note that other CID/Gallup 
polls taken a few weeks before the previous elections show 
levels of support similar to the ones the current candidates 
have. For instance, in November 1985 Oscar Arias had a backing 
of 45 percent, whereas Rafael Calderon had 43 percent. Four 
years later Carlos Manuel Castillo had a support of 38 percent, 
and Calderon 43 percent. To be sure, the characteristics of 
those campaigns were different than the current one, as was 
noted earlier. The electorate perceives Miguel Angel Rodriguez 
more positively than Jose Maria Figueres. A total of 50.6 
percent of Costa Ricans regard the Social Christian Party 
favorably and 30.2 percent unfavorably, leaving a positive 
balance of 20.4 percent. 
  Figures, in turn, receives a favorable opinion from 46.1 
percent of the people and an unfavorable opinion from 35.1 
percent. The difference is 11 points. 
  Comparing the results with the previous survey, Figures goes 
up 3.2 percent, whereas Rodriguez drops 2.9 percent.

  [Text] Labor Minister Juan Sifontes said the International 
Labor Organization (ILO) agrees with the Labor Code reforms 
presented by the government. 
  The minister said that Arturo Bronstein, chief of the 
Legislation Section of the ILO headquartered in Geneva, sent him 
a letter dated 20 December describing the reforms as "important 
advances over the current Labor Code." 
  In the letter, Bronstein stressed that "the reforms follow 
the draft recommended by the ILO to a great extent." These 
reforms were made known in the "Forum for Economic and Social 
Consensus" formed by government, labor, and private enterprise 
sectors. 
  The ILO had recommended two changes to Articles 211, 214, 
and 
228 dealing with the protection of union founders. 
Nevertheless, the minister explained that those articles 
referred to the "promoters," not the founders, as a result of 
which Bronstein expressed his total acceptance of the draft. 
  The Labor Ministry presented the Labor Code reforms to the 
Legislative Assembly at the end of 1993. The ILO's support of 
the reforms are in addition to the favorable report on labor 
rights issued by the U.S. Commerce Department. 
  The reforms were made in response to intense pressure from 
the U.S. Government, which threatened to suspend the Generalized 
System of Preferences under which some Salvadoran products are 
exempt from import duties. Some say that the ILO is dependent 
on U.S. trade unions interested in promoting trade unionism in 
the Third World. 
  Many analysts believe the new code might reactivate labor 
agitation in the country and block the reconstruction process. 
  Salvadoran union leaders have accused the government of 
breaking the "consensus" by presenting the draft reforms, 
indicating that they do not agree with some points. 
Nevertheless, the Legislative Assembly will have the last word.

  [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 14 Jan, CANA -- A conference of 
the Caribbean Group for Co-operation in Economic Development 
(CGCED) to be held here January 27-28 is being billed as a major 
opportunity for Guyana to secure commitments of funding. 
  Government officials say they are "cautiously optimistic" 
that the World Bank forum can produce pledges of new funding to 
plug a US40 million to US50 million dollar projected financing 
gap in 1994. 
  The World Bank said nearly 50 countries and international 
organisations are expected to be represented at the meeting 
which will focus on Guyana's economic recovery effort. 
  Together with Guyana's major creditor nations and several 
newly industrialised countries, attendance at the meeting will 
include the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the International Finance 
Corporation, the Internationsl Fund for Agricultural 
Development, the Kuwait Fund, and the International Moetary Fund. 
  CGCED, meeting here for the first time, is a World Bank 
forum 
which helps coordinate external aid to Caribbean states. 
  Guyana's president, Dr. cheddi Jagan, is scheduled to 
address 
the delegates January 27, and a financing plan and the donors' 
programme for Guyana will be examined on January 28. On Jan. 
28, also, the Guyana Government will host a discussion on its 
development programme. 
  Former US President Jimmy Carter, who spearheaded 
international participation in Guyana's October 1992 elections, 
widely heralded as marking the country's return to democracy, is 
also to participate in the forum. Carter, representing the 
Altanta-based Carter centre of Emory University, is expected in 
Guyana January 25 for the conference. 
  Dr Uma Lele, an official of centre [as received] visiting 
here this week, said the former President's role at the coming 
meeting will be to understand the constraints faced by nations 
like Guyana and the demands that donors make, and to identify 
how he could help.

  [Text] Villavicencio -- The confirmation of the presence of 
U.S. troops in this jurisdiction has caused indignation and 
surprise among the Meta Department and Puerto Lopez Municipality 
authorities. 
  Meta Department Governor Omar Armando Baquero asked the 
national Navy command for an explanation of the task being 
carried out by foreign soldiers in Puerto Lopez and why regional 
and municipal authorities were not informed about this. 
  EL TIEMPO has learned that some 70 U.S. soldiers, guarded by 
Colombian soldiers, have been in Puerto Lopez for one month, 
apparently building a pier for the national Navy in Rio Meta. It 
appears they are the soldiers who stayed six months in Guaviare 
Department where, according to local authorities, they built a 
naval base. 
  The U.S. troops are under the command of a lieutenant whose 
identity could not be established, while Major Alvaro Rico, 
commander of the Advanced River Port No. 63, is in command of 
the national units. 
  The operations base is located only five minutes away from 
the urban area of Puerto Lopez, near the road to Puerto Gaitan, 
and is camouflaged by big trees in a place called Senar, on the 
banks of Rio Meta. Some kind of camp and several shacks can be 
observed at the site where the Colombian sentries stand guard. 
  So far, some land movement and flattening work has been 
performed with heavy equipment such as backhoes, bulldozers, 
cargo trucks, dump trucks, etc. 
  Puerto Lopez Mayor Hernan Saavedra stated he learned of the 
foreign troops' presence some 20 days ago, not from an official 
report from authorities but because he observed some soldiers in 
the municipality's urban area. 
  The municipality residents explained it is customary to see 
groups of Colombian soldiers escorting foreigners who come to 
town to make telephone calls or to shop. 
  Brigadier General Luis Bernardo Urbina Sanchez, 7th Brigade 
commander, admitted knowing about the troops' presence in Puerto 
Lopez from early December. He added the U.S. soldiers will 
conclude their works in mid-February and will then leave the 
region.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 14 Jan (EFE) -- 
Despite the Mexican Army's unilateral cease-fire in Chiapas and 
the apparent peace that prevails in that southern Mexican state, 
today the press reported sporadic clashes in Lacandona where 
rebel groups are hiding. 
  After the Mexican Army's offensive during the first days of 
the armed uprising that began on 1 January, members of the 
Zapatist National Liberation Front (EZLN) retreated to the 
jungle areas near San Cristobal de las Casas, from where they 
direct their attacks. 
  On Wednesday [12 January] Mexican President Carlos Salinas 
de 
Gortari ordered the Armed Forces to observe a cease-fire against 
the "transgressors of the law" (as the government describes the 
rebels) and since then official reports maintain there is 
absolute peace in that area. 
  The Mexican press, however, reported on today's front page 
that some isolated groups of soldiers have clashed with rebels 
on Wednesday and Thursday without specifying which side fired 
first. 
  The daily LA JORNADA reported that a group of soldiers 
clashed with presumed guerrillas in the Lacandona jungle area, a 
few kilometers from the Indian village of San Miguel. 
  "There is no truce, no cease-fire in the Chiapas jungles," 
the report said. "We were stopped by recurrent detonations that 
sounded like a pistol discharging all of its ammunition. Those 
detonations were followed by synchronized machinegun fire. We 
heard heavy shooting from tanks. For 10 minutes, the shooting 
made the jungle birds fly away, while we waited in Chuvi," LA 
JORNADA journalists reported. 
  The report added that a dozen tanks entered the towns of San 
Miguel, Patate Viejo, and Chivi on Thursday "attacking EZLN 
rebels," and that helicopters and reconnaissance planes 
participated in the attack. 
  Apparently the announcement of the unilateral cease-fire has 
not reached the soldiers, who are still searching for rebels in 
the jungles of Lacandona -- considered the "lungs of Mexico" -- 
and probably it has not reached the Zapatists dispersed in the 
mountains either. 
  Regarding this, it is being said this is why the EZLN 
General 
Command has not responded to the government's invitation to hold 
peace talks, which is creating a tense and long wait for 
authorities. 
  Civilian sources from the town of Altamirano, which was 
taken 
by the rebels on 1 January, said the soldiers, who were deployed 
there to prevent more rebels attacks, maintain it in a "virtual 
state of siege. They do not allow us to go out to work in the 
fields or visit relatives in other villages; they supervise the 
distribution of food and supplies and oversee the activities of 
all residents of Altamirano as if we were suspects," one of the 
residents said. 
  The National Defense Secretariat reported the situation in 
the mountainous and jungle region in Los Altos de Chiapas 
"remains completely calm." It added that during the patrols 
ordered by the Army to guarantee peace in the region and the 
security of the local residents "no armed group was discovered" 
in the last 24 hours. 
  Most radio, television, and newspaper media, relying on 
official reports, maintain that peace reigns in the area and 
that the dialogue between the government and the rebels will be 
held soon.

  [Excerpts] The U.S. trade representative [Mickey Kantor] 
and the Canadian minister of international trade [Roy MacLaren] 
agreed at a news conference that the Mexican Government alone 
must resolve the armed conflict in Chiapas State by acting 
wisely to restore social peace. MacLaren said the Mexican 
Government must be cautious to achieve a peaceful solution. 
  [Begin MacLaren recording] I hope the Mexican Government's 
good sense and wisdom will lead to the prompt resolution of the 
conflict in Chiapas. [end recording] 
  Mickey Kantor said his government has no reason to meddle in 
the internal affairs of other nations, but nothing can prevent 
the United States from observing the events that take place in 
other nations. [passage omitted] 
  Jaime Serra Puche, Mexican Secretary of Commerce and 
Industrial Development, was also present at the news conference 
and said that a society can progress only if there is social 
peace. 
  [Begin Serra Puche recording] Every sector of Mexican 
society should try to create a harmonious atmosphere that will 
allow our society and economy to operate in peace and stability 
and sufficiently free from concern so we can enjoy continued 
progress and growth and improve the distribution of our 
country's wealth. Every Mexican must make this effort. [end 
recording] 
  Aside from political issues, the commerce secretaries 
announced that this was the first meeting held since NAFTA went 
into effect and that it marked the inauguration of the Free 
Trade Agreement Commission, which will be headed by the Mexican 
commerce secretary, the U.S. trade representative, and the 
Canadian international trade minister. The commission will be 
based in Mexico. Plans for opening other commissions were also 
set into motion. 
  Serra, Kantor, and MacLaren agreed to meet on 15 April in 
Morocco within the framework of the conclusion of the GATT 
Uruguay Round. 
  The officials also discussed the possible participation of 
other nations in NAFTA, but no conclusions were reached.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 17 Jan (NA) -- Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo today said that within Mercosur [Common Market 
of the South] "the only point about which there is a serious 
argument or on which positions are still very divergent" is the 
adoption of a tariff for importation of capital goods and 
informatics products. 
  The minister is now in the Uruguayan city of Colonia, where 
the Argentine, Brazilian, Uruguayan, and Paraguayan presidents, 
along with their ministers of economy, are attending a Mercosur 
summit. 
  Cavallo denied that the deadlines for implementation of 
Mercosur will be postponed, noting in this regard that a 
document christened "Consolidation of the Customs Union and 
Transition Toward the Common Market" will be signed "probably 
this afternoon." 
  Concerning informatics products, the minister said that 
Argentina advocates "a very low tariff, like the one agreed upon 
within the NAFTA," adding that Brazil "wants a very high tariff 
because it has a protection system." 
  He added: "When there is no agreement, debates continue, but 
this is an issue on which we can reach a final agreement if each 
country maintains a tariff structure for the capital goods it 
wants, and if a convergence process is then implemented." 
  In statements to a Buenos Aires radio station, Cavallo said 
that Argentina "wants all areas of the economy, industry, the 
farm sector, and the services to make investments, purchasing 
the best possible technology at the lowest price." 
  "That is why we encourage our capital goods producers with 
internal tax refunds, but we will not permit them to sell their 
equipment at prices that are higher than those prevailing 
abroad," he said.

Brewer said the Council of Ministers decided to reform Article 
2 of the VAT and that merchants must request the necessary 
authorization from the Finance Ministry prior to 28 February. 
He added that consumers cannot be charged the VAT until 
merchants obtain the authorization and duly display it in their 
stores and outlets. 
  [Begin Brewer recording] This means that retail merchants 
cannot charge consumers the VAT until they obtain the proper 
authorization. Of course, any VAT collected up to this point 
must be turned over to the National Treasury. The Tax Office 
will fine merchants according to the current tax law if they 
violate this law in any way. [end recording]

  [Text] After expressing his sympathies to relatives of the 
victims of the helicopter crash, President Fujimori said no 
possibilities can be rejected in cases of this sort and would 
not rule out sabotage as the cause of the accident. Fujimori 
added that his government will not reconsider the sanctions 
imposed on Chilean MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] 
members. 
  [Begin recording] [Fujimori] I reject the report saying that 
the helicopter crash was caused by a fuel shortage or poor 
maintenance. Accidents of this sort happen by chance and are 
regrettable. They must be investigated in a strictly technical 
manner. The Air Force has appointed an investigative commission 
to investigate the accident. The reasons for the crash 
helicopter must be clearly outlined, because according to the 
control tower, the helicopter was landing as usual with no 
problems. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Is it possible to investigate the 
reasons for a possible sabotage of this helicopter? 
  [Fujimori] No possibilities can or should be ruled out. I 
had even planned to fly to Cuzco before going to Arequipa. I 
flew with the crew of that helicopter a week ago and everything 
was normal. I think this was a rather unexpected event. The 
investigations must be thorough to eliminate all possibilities 
other than technical or circumstantial reasons. 
  Regarding the Chilean MRTA members, they did not perpetrate 
these hideous crimes in Chile but in Peru, and they have been 
sentenced to life imprisonment. I reiterate: I will not 
reverse my position. They have been tried according to 
antiterrorist laws. The Peruvian position on this is clear: 
Peru has a right to peace. 
  [Reporter] Will the sentences be reconsidered? 
  [Fujimori] Not at all. [end recording]

  [Text] The Guatemalan Army stands ready to begin joint 
military operations with Mexican military forces to counter the 
guerrilla uprising in Chiapas, as long as agreements to the 
effect exist between the governments of both nations, Armed 
Forces Spokesperson Edith Vargas de Marroquin said yesterday. 
  Although she recognized that the Mexican Army is 
well-organized and is capable enough to face and quell the 
rebels' actions launched on 1 January, the military spokesperson 
said that Guatemala could provide some logistical support, if 
requested by authorities of the neighboring country. 
  The statements by the military spokesperson came as news 
agencies reported that Mexican soldiers were approaching the 
Guatemalan border (10 km away) to counter the actions of the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). 
  Vargas de Marroquin explained that since the fighting in 
Chiapas began Salinas de Gortari's government has not officially 
informed them of the events, but Army units patrol the border 
areas to prevent any eventuality. 
  Regarding a possible entry of Mexican troops into Guatemalan 
territory, the officer explained she does not think that may 
happen, although Guatemalan soldiers have sometimes entered the 
neighboring country, chasing members of clandestine groups, the 
participation of which in the Zapatist movement has not yet been 
confirmed. 
<H5>  Concern over the PMA [Mobile Military Police] </H5>
  Vargas de Marroquin also stated that the military forces 
have 
expressed their great concern over recent bank robberies, 
because police investigations indicate that members of the PMA 
are involved. 
  To avoid that situation, Vargas de Marroquin added, the Army 
has decided to review each of the contracts, as well as the 
weapons of agents assigned to the security of private 
enterprises. In addition, the military officer said that 
Obdulio Carias Garcia, who died in the robbery of Banco Uno, 
located in Vista Hermosa, was one of the security agents. 
  Eustaquio Ramos Vasquez and Pilar Florian Cordero, who were 
arrested the evening of 12 January, the National Police have 
reported, also participated in that action. The Information and 
Press Department of the Army (DIDE) has confirmed those 
individuals are PMA members.

<F P=106> [From the "Newspaper of the Airwaves, Second Edition" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Alberto Fujimori has announced that drug 
trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, also known as El 
Vaticano, will receive a life sentence. The president said that 
the drug trafficker, who was deported from Colombia, was one of 
the leading drug traffickers in Alto Huallaga and his capture is 
comparable to Abimael Guzman's. 
  [Begin recording] [Fujimori] Chavez Penaherrera moved 
approximately 30 tons of drugs monthly and had his own airport 
in Campanilla. Every month he made approximately 40 flights and 
collected a total of $30 million. He was the main cocaine 
supplier for the Cali Cartel, which, in turn, exported almost 90 
percent of that cocaine to the (?United States). In short, this 
has truly been a harsh blow to the drug trade. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What sentence will he get? 
  [Fujimori] We have passed very timely legislation on drug 
trafficking. Now we can give El Vaticano the maximum sentence: 
life in prison. There can be no doubt of that. I believe that 
for narcoterrorism, El Vaticano's capture is comparable to that 
of Abimael Guzman. 
  [Reporter] [question indistinct] 
  [Fujimori] I repeat, two. (?Lacalinia and Caloveda) are 
brothers who have already been captured. There is an entire 
network of people who are involved and they have either been 
captured or are being investigated. This capture constitutes a 
terrible setback for narcoterrorism. [end recording] 
  This is what President Fujimori said at the closing of the 
academic year at the National Fine Arts School. The president 
announced that a new fine arts institute is going to be built.

  [Text] Lima, 15 Jan (AFP) -- It was officially reported 
today that the Peruvian Government extended the state of 
emergency for 60 days beginning today in various provinces in 
six departments to "facilitate military operations against 
terrorism and drug trafficking." 
  The special measure, which is published in the official 
gazette EL PERUANO, covers several provinces of the Departments 
of Lima, Callao, Ancash (Andean northeast), Ucayali, Huanuco 
(central jungle), and Loreto (eastern Amazon). The 
corresponding decrees establish the suspension of constitutional 
rights and indicate that the Armed Forces will continue to 
maintain control over the previously mentioned areas. 
  Since the beginning of the "fratricidal war" in Ayacucho in 
1980, more than 60 percent of the country has been under a state 
of emergency. According to official figures, the conflict has 
killed more than 26,000 people and caused more than $24 billion 
in economic damage, which is equivalent to the country's foreign 
debt.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Lima Radio Programas del Peru Network 
in Spanish at 1400 GMT on 8 January broadcasts a three-hour 
panel discussion during the "Saturday Focus" program hosted by 
Denis Vargas with the participation of President Alberto 
Fujimori and panel members Richard Bauer, president of the 
National Association of Foreign Correspondents; Arturo Salazar 
Larrain and Ismael Leon from LA REPUBLICA; and Augusto Alvarez 
Rodrich, chief editor of Apoyo Company publications. 
  Vargas begins the program by reminding the president that it 
is traditional for the executive to give every new year a name. 
Fujimori says he does not think the year should be given the 
name of a historical figure but that it should reflect the 
country's goals and objectives. He remarks: "I think that in 
the short and medium term, our children must be better prepared; 
therefore, education and sports are the main themes of the year. 
Although this has not been approved by the Council of 
Ministers, I would like to go ahead and call it the Year of 
Education Modernization and Sports. We will continue this 
campaign to modernize our education system and to sponsor 
sports. For example, we will build coliseums and stadiums 
nationwide" 
  Vargas goes on to say that because 1994 will be the year of 
education modernization, it is understood that the main reforms 
will be in that field. Vargas notes: "It has been said that the 
directors of state schools will be rigorously evaluated. Those 
who are good will remain, those who are not prepared will be 
dismissed." President Fujimori responds that the evaluations do 
not mean that the directors will have to take exams but that 
they will have to show results. Fujimori comments that this 
evaluation will give the directors stability for five years, but 
appointments cannot be indefinite as if the directors were 
judges. Fujimori notes that although the community will be in 
charge of the school administration, that does not translate 
into privatization of education because the state will continue 
to provide funding. 
  Bauer asks when the first school will be turned over to 
local 
administration. Fujimori replies that the pilot plan will be 
implemented in Arequipa, where a chain of eight schools have 
already been built with 10 more to be completed. "The state 
will not eliminate subsidies. On the contrary, it will increase 
these subsidies." Fujimori adds that free education will now be 
offered in modern buildings rather than in straw huts. 
  Changing the subject, Bauer asks President Fujimori for his 
assessment of the continued violence following the arrest of 
Abimael Guzman. Fujimori responds that it is a fact that the 
level of violence has gone down. "Shining Path no longer has its 
previous organizational capacity." Fujimori notes that there 
are still some fanatics whom he intends to capture or eliminate. 
  Bauer asks if there is any truth to rumors that the 
government is exporting repentant terrorists to other nations 
with new identities. Fujimori laughs and responds: "Well, 
concerning trade in terrorists, I would say that we have had 
imports rather than exports from some developed nations, which 
in turn have protected those people." Fujimori adds that there 
have been more cases of repentant terrorist and that these have 
been presented to the media. 
  Vargas asks if terrorist leaders will receive death 
sentences 
now that the new Constitution is in force. Fujimori answers 
that such sentences must be in line with international treaties 
and follow certain steps. "In the coming years, I do not think 
it will be necessary to apply the death sentence because I am 
sure we will achieve peace in the nation." 
  Commenting on human rights, President Fujimori insists that 
it is necessary to defend the human rights not only of 
terrorists but of civilians, the human and social rights Peru's 
22 million inhabitants. He concludes that Peru is entitled to 
live in peace, to give life sentences to terrorists, and to 
correct its mistakes. 
  In response to a question from Augusto Alvarez concerning 
the 
scope of the concerted effort proposed by Democratic Constituent 
Congress, CCD, President Jaime Yoshiyama, Fujimori says that 
"consensus comes through proposals. Yoshiyama's proposal 
purports to resolve the country's problems through truly 
technical rather than political mechanisms or methodology." 
  Fujimori said the invitation extended by Engineer Yoshiyama 
to various organizations has been very timely because those 
organizations will be able to set forth proposals free of 
partisan and ideological influence and will therefore be more 
widely accepted by the people. 
  Having been put in contact with several Latin American 
reporters via satellite, President Fujimori takes a question 
from Eduardo Lozano of Colombia's Radio Cadena Nacional. Lozano 
asks President Fujimori what qualities the Peruvian people see 
in Colombian President Cesar Gaviria to make him worthy of being 
OAS secretary general, to which Fujimori responds: "I have seen 
President Cesar Gaviria in action at various international 
forums, where he has proven himself to be a true statesman with 
a spirit of integration. He has also displayed the ability to 
analyze situations and make decisions, an attribute which I 
believe is necessary for the secretaryship. Moreover, I am a 
personal friend of President Gaviria, and he has Peru's total 
support. We are among his promoters." 
  The topic of the interview changes when Elsy Barroeta from 
Caracas Radio Caracas Television Network asks President Fujimori 
about the presence in Peru of the Venezuelan coupist military 
officers and the efforts made by the two governments to achieve 
the officers' return to Venezuela. Fujimori responds that there 
have been contacts at the Foreign Ministry level, but Venezuela 
wants to prosecute these officers, so some of them are unwilling 
to return under those conditions. 
  Barroeta then asks Fujimori what kind of relations he 
expects between Peru and Venezuela after Rafael Caldera takes 
office and what personal relations between he and Caldera will 
be like. Fujimori says: "I do not have the slightest doubt that 
we will continue to strengthen the ties between our two 
countries and that we will continue working to make integration 
a reality. I have already spoken personally with President 
Caldera, he said, and I wish him the greatest success in office 
so Venezuela can progress." 
  Jorge Melo of Radio Quito then asks president Fujimori 
whether the visit Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen will 
make to Peru is official and if the border conflict will be 
included in the agenda. Fujimori responds: "Of course his 
visit is official, as was my first visit to Quito, of which I 
have very fond memories. Every time someone mentions Quito to 
me, I become emotional. However, this visit is to strengthen the 
friendship between our two countries. Instead of discussing 
border conflicts, we will discuss integration as we did during 
my first visit to Ecuador in January 1992." 
  Program host Dennis Vargas then brings up the issue of 
expectation among Latin Americans, especially in the Andean 
region, concerning Peru's exact position on integration and the 
Cartagena Agreement. Why has Peru decided to distance itself 
from integration until March or April? 
  Fujimori responds with two reasons, the first of which is 
tariffs. Peru, he says, has a flat [previous word in English] 
15-percent tariff on consumer or capital goods, while other 
countries' tariffs vary from 0 to 30 percent, which undermines 
Peru's competitiveness. The other reason is subsidies, which 
have been eliminated in Peru. 
  Vargas insists on the issue, saying that integration is 
happening through blocs and that Peru is absent from Latin 
America's first integration bloc, the Cartagena Agreement. He 
asks President Fujimori: Do you agree with people who say it is 
impossible to enter the big NAFTA market without being in a 
group, which even the U.S. Government has admitted? What policy 
will Peru adopt on NAFTA? 
  President Fujimori answers that at some point Peru will have 
to rejoin the Cartagena Agreement. He says that for the past 
three years the country has developed very rapidly in order to 
be able to join other markets by creating competition through 
the reduction of protectionist measures. We are working, 
Fujimori said, for an open economy, which is essential if we are 
to join any free market. 
  The host concludes Peru's participation in the satellite 
linkup with a question concerning the struggle against drug 
trafficking in Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia. He asks President 
Fujimori what Peru's strategy will be with the new 
administration in the United States, which consumes almost 80 
percent of the drugs produced worldwide, to which Fujimori 
responds: "I think we must continue communicating on realistic 
terms, which is what the Peruvian Government has always done, 
and we must acknowledge that the previous strategy did not work, 
that it was a true failure, and that effective measures must be 
adopted before it is too late." Fujimori goes on to explain 
that Peru produces coca, not heroin, and that the government 
will implement very drastic measures whereby penal and civil 
sanctions will be imposed on individuals who produce poppies. 
These measures will include the seizure of properties and 
prison sentences, and there will be no lenience whatsoever. 
  Dennis Vargas Marin asks President Fujimori to comment on 
the situation in Chiapas State, Mexico and whether he believes 
there is any connection between the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army, EZLN, and the Shinning Path or other guerrilla 
groups. Fujimori then says he hopes there is no ideological 
relationship between the EZLN rebels and terrorist groups, even 
though it is known that some Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
terrorists have gone to Mexico. 
  Fujimori says he thinks the Chiapas affair is "a rebellion 
in 
a poor area headed by -- I suppose -- leftist intellectuals, 
socialists, who mean to say: You see, the market system does 
not work. It is something like that. However, I do not believe 
a rebellion like the one in Chiapas State has the 
characteristics of a terrorist movement." 
  Augusto Alvarez Rodrich then asks President Fujimori about 
the lessons learned from the referendum on the constitutional 
reforms. Fujimori answers that he has received a message. The 
message is that the people are not against the reform but that 
they want adjustments to those reforms. 
  Alvarez then asks the president if he believes the 
referendum 
results mean that he no longer represents the spirit of renewal 
that the people want. Fujimori replies that there has indeed 
been a rebellion of the citizenry and society at the ballot 
boxes, but that he "still represents the rebellion against the 
political system that has taken place here in Peru." He adds 
that the desire for renewal continues, but that the government 
has not been weakened. He states: "It had been said that the 
honeymoon was only going to last nine months or a year. 
Instead, there is popular support. All modesty aside, I think 
I continue to represent this need for change in the country." 
  Alvarez asks whether the visits to the departments and 
provinces are part of a strategy to drum up support after the 
referendum. Fujimori answers that it is only a continuation of 
his original policy and that he is trying to provide the people 
with more information on educational and government programs "to 
disprove the disinformation that the government is privatizing 
education, eliminating free schooling, and taking land away from 
the peasants." 
  In response to several short comments and questions from 
Alvarez, Fujimori compares the country's situation in 1992 to 
that in 1993 and points out the improvements and advances in the 
economy, the pacification process, and the privatization 
process. Regarding the privatization process, he says that 
State enterprises are now worth 10 times more than what they 
were worth in 1992. 
  Arturo Salazar Larrain asks whether the situation for 
Peruvians will improve and if people's budgets are in the red 
even though the fiscal year has ended with a positive balance. 
He says that taxes are going up while salaries have stagnated. 
Salazar adds that it is not fair that the budget for defense is 
five times greater than the health budget. 
  Fujimori responds by saying that taxes for the poor have 
gone 
down. He says that except for one socioeconomic level, everyone 
is paying a little less. The president cites the elimination of 
the tax on business assets and says he hopes this measure will 
bolster economic reactivation. He then adds that the government 
has also eliminated the minimum income tax. 
  Salazar says the national budget increased enormously 
between 
1991 and 1993. It was $3.617 billion in 1991, $4.885 billion in 
1992, to $5.434 billion in 1993. He then asks: How are those 
resources distributed and where do they come from? 
  President Fujimori answers: "Right now they are coming from 
people who pay high taxes, and that is precisely what allows us 
to provide greater social attention. I agree with you that 
fiscal funds are in the black and the majority of people's 
pockets are in the red. But that is the part we are still 
inheriting. We are fixing many things. I ask: Is there an 
alternative? I wish the economists would give me alternatives. 
Tell me there was a better alternative to the dealings with the 
Paris Club. If they would give me the numbers, I could debate 
it even though I am not an economist. Things are being handled 
very seriously. Our country was in a crisis with 
hyperinflation, but we are overcoming the situation." 
  Regarding a comment from Salazar on the difference between 
the budgets for health and defense, Fujimori goes on to outline 
the changes in the military budget that will be in accordance 
with the advances in the pacification, saying that the number of 
troops and policemen will not be increased. 
  Ismael Leon tries to pin Fujimori down on the poor 
referendum results by suggesting that he, Fujimori, should not 
try to explain it by saying that "50 percent of the people have 
been deceived." Leon says the president should look at it from 
a different point of view: "There is unemployment, health care 
problems, school truancy, and in many ways, there is less 
democracy." Leon says that when Fujimori speaks of "taking 
resources to the regions," he is speaking in paternalistic 
terms. Leon asks what has been done with the funds earned from 
the sale of public enterprises. He says he has a letter from 
Constituent Assemblyman Dr. Antero Flores Araoz, who was unable 
to obtain that information from the government. 
  Fujimori asks Dennis Vargas for a 30-minute program to 
debate 
each of Leon's points, then he reminds Alvarez of the fact that 
the media is respected and allowed full freedom. In reply to 
Leon, Fujimori says that in many provinces he visited, there 
were widespread misconceptions about what the referendum really 
meant, including the belief that capital punishment would bring 
about a bloodbath. The president justifies taking resources to 
the area and used improvements to the Cuzco airport as an 
example. He says that a Korean credit has allowed eight 
tourists flights a day. "Public enterprises have been sold 
under the best conditions, and I challenge anyone to identify 
one that has not been properly sold." Fujimori tells Leon to 
examine the public budget to see where the money has gone. He 
says: "Look at the social expenditures, go to the poor 
neighborhoods where the privatization funds have been invested." 
He adds that there is a list specifying how the funds have been 
invested. 
  Alvarez goes directly to the point and asks: "Why not admit 
there is a problem. I do not think the funds are being 
improperly used." He says that if Fujimori gave a better 
explanation of how the funds were used, there would be greater 
acceptance. 
  Fujimori answers by saying that he is surprised that an 
economist of Alvarez' stature is apparently unaware that all 
revenues go into a common treasury fund, thus individual 
government projects cannot be attributed to specific sales of 
government enterprises. 
  Ismael Leon asks Fujimori what made him change his mind, 
albeit for the better, on such things as his initial refusal to 
privatize certain basic public services, including ports, postal 
services, and telecommunications. Fujimori half jokingly refers 
to a book called CITIZEN FUJIMORI [Ciudadano Fujimori], which 
describes him as pragmatic. He admits that he rejected such 
privatization on 3 June 1990, and by 6 July 1992 he had changed 
his mind. Fujimori recalls saying that "public enterprises do 
not work -- probably on Radio Programas -- and that they have 
incurred a $2.5 billion deficit" despite the fact that "every 
possible effort was made to prop them up." He adds: "We are 
looking for democracy. People want privatization, thus the 
change. We need not be stubborn." 
  Replying to Ismael Leon's question on telecommunication 
monopolies, Fujimori says that this is sometimes unavoidable in 
communications and electric enterprises and adds that the 
telephone system should serve not only Lima and the surrounding 
area but the entire country. Fujimori adds: "I know that Mr. 
Genaro Delgado Parker has interests in communications systems, 
but I do not defend anyone's interest. I want things to be 
clear." The topic continues with a discussion about the lack of 
telephone lines, with Lima alone requiring 160,000 new lines and 
needing large investments. Fujimori adds: "We have 2.6 
telephones for every 100 inhabitants. Do you know how we rank 
among Latin American countries? Next to the last; the last 
country is Haiti." Fujimori suggests to Dennis Vargas that a 
technical debate be held on this topic alone. 
  The topic then shifts when Vargas asks Fujimori if there 
will 
be a reduction in the Army and if the Army Technical School will 
close. Fujimori denies that the school will be closed and says 
defense and education expenditures will remain the same with no 
reductions except "a minimum reduction in recruitment." 
Fujimori says there will be training changes for the new 
recruits and uses the "example that those learning to operate 
tanks will now know how to operate heavy equipment. Those who 
drive trucks will leave the service with a certificate for 
commercial trucks." Fujimori explains that the new Armed Forces 
for peace should become "a great professional technical training 
center in addition to instilling patriotism, order, and 
discipline in many youths who need it." Fujimori adds that he 
"does not intend to purchase Mirage fighter jets, tanks, or 
missiles. It is a reduction and rationalization of 
expenditures." 
  Fujimori explains that expenditures are being cut and made 
more economical. He notes that Peru "has approximately 100,000 
policemen. That is enough. Better yet, it is too many for 
Peru." The president reports that there will be no more police 
recruiting. 
  A panelist asks Fujimori about unjustified arrests, and he 
replies that government attorneys are investigating such cases 
but that everyone must be patient. He admits: "There are some 
cases that have yet to be corrected, but sometimes mistakes are 
made in the struggle against terrorism. I ask you: What 
country has not make any mistakes? Tell me if no mistakes were 
made in Vietnam, Algeria, and in many other places." He states: 
"We cannot let isolated cases make us forget the situation that 
existed in Peru." Referring to the remodeled Castro Castro 
Prison, Fujimori says it looks like a five-star hotel: "We are 
enforcing respect for human rights as much as we can." 
  Asked about communications with Abimael Guzman, Fujimori 
explains: "Contacts continue. Of course in recent days we have 
said that there have been attacks and that there should be some 
control mechanisms. Otherwise the entire process could lead to 
stagnation. I hope we are successful." 
  One panelist asks Fujimori why he shook hands with Cox 
Beuzeville and not the other alleged criminals. The Peruvian 
president explains: "I cannot shake hands with 3,000 
terrorists. I greeted him because we happened to meet, and 
courtesy is always foremost. In the case of Guzman's letter, 
there have been notable effects. The desertions in Sol de Oro, 
Ayacucho, occurred because of the information about the 
surrender of Abimael Guzman. There have been mass desertions 
like never before. In the past, only one or two isolated 
Shining Path members deserted. There were always many 
desertions from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, but the 
Shining Path desertions began with these letters." 
  Fujimori later explains that he is president of all 
Peruvians 
and is therefore uninterested in party organizations. "Parties 
have not worked out in many Latin American countries, and that 
is why democracy is being questioned and why some want more 
Chinese [Fujimori calls himself El Chino, the Chinese] in Latin 
American countries." 
  A panelist asks: "How can a president feel safe without a 
political party supporting him. Do you only trust the people 
and the Army?" 
  Fujimori explains: "I feel safe with results, with the 
support of the common people, but I defend myself from power 
groups that try to undermine my position. Democracy is built 
with the people, by supporting the people. Democracy is not 
edible. Please visit Pamplona and ask the people there about 
democracy. 
  Alvarez tells Fujimori that he is going to close the 
interview with a personal question. He tells Fujimori that he 
was aggressive throughout the interview and that he has aged. 
Alvarez then asks: "How have these four years changed you? 
Tell me!" 
  Fujimori laughs and retorts: "I will answer you. I said 
earlier that old people are meeting here. If you look at 
yourself in the mirror, you will find that you also have changed 
in the past three years, Alvarez, and your criticism has failed 
quite often. I regret that I was aggressive. I had not 
realized that. I wanted to engage in a specific debate. When 
somebody tells me that things are not functioning in the Armed 
Forces -- I suppose this is where I am aggressive -- I could 
jump all the way to the roof. If there had not been a 
television camera here, I could have pounded on...[pauses] not 
on Dennis but on the table!" 
  Vargas closes the interview by asking: "When will you begin 
your 1995 campaign, Mr. President, and how long before then do 
you plan to resign from the presidency so Congress President 
Jaime Yoshiyama can replace you in the government palace?" 
  Fujimori responds: "I don't know. I haven't thought about 
it. I don't have an answer now. Invite me to another program."

  [Text] Lima, 14 Jan (EFE) -- Peru's principal mayors have 
created a common front against President Alberto Fujimori's 
administration due to its decision to make big cuts in their 
municipal fiscal revenues. 
  What seemed to be only a "skirmish" between Fujimori and 
Lima 
Mayor Ricardo Belmont could become a major "war" which could 
even end up in court. 
  Belmont received on 13 January the support of Cusco Mayor 
Daniel Estrada, who asked him to coordinate with other affected 
mayors "a common strategy to force back autocracy and 
arbitrariness." 
  Socialist Alfonso Barrantes, former Lima mayor, has joined 
them and said that he is willing to work in "any position 
assigned to me to defend municipal laws." 
  Belmont was unusually tough and has accused the government 
of 
"harming Lima more than terrorism does." He added that "more 
works have been interrupted than those we implemented in one 
year due to budget cuts. It is as though The Trebol (the 
biggest cloverleaf in Lima) was dynamited." 
  The possibility that this conflict will reach the courts has 
even been left open, because the Popular Action Party (AP) has 
decided that its mayors will file an amparo against the law that 
cuts municipal revenues. 
  Arturo Castillo, Association of Peruvian Municipalities 
(AMPE) president and Chiclayo mayor, is among the AP mayors. 
  President Fujimori refused, meanwhile, to change his mind 
about his governmental decision and underscored that the 
government has not cut municipal revenues, rather, "has 
distributed them more equitably." 
  He added that "what we did was channel more funds to poorer 
municipalities, which will then be able to carry out more works 
to benefit their peoples." He added that the municipalities 
whose revenues were cut "can get more funds from other sources 
because they control the regions that are richest in resources." 
  Certain experts believe that Fujimori is playing a political 
game to thwart the presidential ambitions of both Belmont and 
Estrada, because they will be unable to deliver the works they 
promised and that they planned to use in their campaigns. 
  The presidential elections will be held in May 1995. This is 
why 1994 is considered an "electorally decisive" year for 
politicians with governmental ambitions. 
  Fujimori has yet to decide if he will run for reelection 
next 
year. Many believe, however, that he is at least trying to 
ensure that his eventual candidacy will have the best chance of 
succeeding.

  [Editorial Report] Lima Radio Programas del Peru Network in 
Spanish at 1400 GMT on 15 January broadcasts live its 60-minute 
"Saturday Focus" program hosted by Dennis Vargas Marin. Vargas 
begins by discussing the government's decision to change the 
municipal tax system. This is a controversial decision, he 
says, and mayors have reacted strongly against cuts in its 
revenues. Vargas adds that Finance Minister Jorge Camet has 
supported the decision of President Fujimori, who said that he 
will prove that municipalities will indeed receive more funds. 
  His guests include Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont; Enrique 
Espinosa, Metropolitan Institute of Planning president; Enrique 
Labarte, municipal economic adviser and assemblyman; and Arturo 
Castillo, Chiclayo mayor and Association of Peruvian 
Municipalities president. 
  Belmont says this hasty decision does not surprise him. A 
similar situation, he adds, happened when Democratic Constituent 
Congress President Jaime Yoshiyama urged Peruvians to vote for 
the new Constitution in the referendum regardless of whether 
they had read it. 
  Vargas asks Belmont what he did when he learned that 
President Fujimori was about to make this decision. Belmont 
says that he protested sternly. He details the works his 
administration has accomplished so far. Labarte quotes a 
congressman who said that municipalities will get more funds, 
except Lima, whose revenues will be redistributed. 
  LA REPUBLICA reporter Ismael Leon asks Belmont what he 
thinks 
about certain mayors' decision to support the redistribution of 
funds from rich municipalities, such as Lima, to poorer 
municipalities. Belmont says that he has been unable to meet 
with President Fujimori to discuss this issue and that it is a 
shame that the president refuses to let anyone do anything good. 
Belmont lists the major achievements of his administration. 
  Vargas asks how this decision will affect Lima in 1994. 
Belmont says that many projects will not be built, that many 
jobs will disappear, and that prices will go up. He compares 
this situation to being in a boxing ring with tied hands. 
  Vargas asks if other mayors agree with Belmont's viewpoints. 
Mayor Castillo says he does, and Chiclayo will also be affected 
by cuts in municipal revenues, he says. 
  Belmont says "Peru is suffering from divisions." He adds 
that 
congressmen should visit Chiclayo, Puno, and other poor 
municipalities to learn firsthand of their realities. Vargas 
agrees with him. Belmont adds that he has visited Huaycan, a 
poor neighborhood. He says he has performed many works, but the 
media have not been invited to the openings or covered such 
events. Belmont says Peru is a whole nation, but "Lima is not 
responsible for the lack of development elsewhere in the country 
and for governmental mistakes." Lima has many problems too, he 
adds. 
  Reporter Leon wonders whether municipal governments are more 
important than regional governments. Castillo says he believes 
that the two governments are necessary to decentralize the 
administration. 
  Vargas cites Economy Minister Camet, who has said provincial 
governments have kept all the funds instead of distributing them 
among municipalities. Castillo replies that this is a big lie. 
Vargas also wonders if this issue is being politicized, and 
Belmont insists it is. He adds that President Fujimori is 
polarizing Peruvians, saying, he is "playing political games." 
  Belmont concludes that the new Constitution will let 
Fujimori 
stay in power for many years, because he will seek reelection, 
but Castillo says he harbors doubts about this possibility.

  [Text] Lima, 16 Jan (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori said today he expects the United States to fulfill the 
pledge it has made to Peru and pay the $105-million contribution 
it has pledged to pay as a member of the Support Group. 
  Fujimori added that he expects "specific results" from the 
United States during the trip that Alexander Watson, assistant 
secretary of state for Latin America, will make to Peru starting 
on 18 January. 
  In statements to the Lima newspaper "EXPRESO," The Peruvian 
president said the United States should display "reciprocity" 
toward Peru, which, he said, has fulfilled the requirements and 
has earned the right to economic support from the friendly 
countries that form the Support Group. 
  The U.S. contribution of $105 million, which was intended, 
along with contributions from five other nations, for the 
recovery of Peru's balance of payments, has not been disbursed 
due to pressure from the U.S. Senate, which believes the human 
rights situation in Peru is not the best. 
  Jorge Camet, Peruvian economy and finance minister, 
confirmed 
recently this circumstance and said the Senate's pressures are 
the result of its "being inadequately informed" about the human 
rights issue in Peru. 
  Fujimori said during the interview that although the United 
States has supported the process whereby Peru was reincorporated 
into the international financial system--from which it had been 
distanced for seven years by the government of former President 
Alan Garcia--it has "not given the money." 
  Fujimori added that Peru is asking the United States to 
fulfill its pledge to the Support Group. 
  The president argued that his country has progressed "much 
more than was expected" in the democratization process, has 
normalized its delayed payments to the international financial 
organizations, and has resolved problems such as the payment of 
a debt contracted by the previous government's nationalization 
of the U.S. "Belco" Oil Company. 
  "I expect specific results. There is no time to continue 
meditating about this," Fujimori said during his interview with 
"EXPRESO" concerning Watson's forthcoming official visit and the 
issues he will discuss with the U.S. official. 
  Various political, legislative, and diplomatic sectors 
believe that such issues as human rights, drug trafficking, and 
the U.S. contribution to the Support Group are the leading 
issues on Watson's agenda. Watson was ambassador to Peru from 
1986 to 1989. 
  Fujimori referred to a recent incident between Peruvian 
Justice Minister Fernando Vega and a commission formed by the 
U.S. State Department and Congress that was in charge of 
evaluating the administration of justice in Peru. 
  Vega had refused to meet with the commission members, 
because 
he felt the expressions used in a letter sent by U.S. Charge 
d'Affaires Charles Brayshaw to request the meeting in question 
were "unacceptable." 
  The Peruvian president justified and supported the justice 
minister's position. "A sovereign country cannot accept the 
terms expressed in the letter," Fujimori told the newspaper. 
  Fujimori said later that the incident does not imply that 
Lima and Washington "are on bad terms" and that "on the 
contrary, there are signs of improvement." 
  Various sources have said the case of the kidnapping and 
murder of nine students and one instructor from the Teachers 
College of Lima, presumably perpetrated by Army members on 18 
July 1992, and the excesses perpetr?ted by the judicial 
administration during the trials of individuals accused of 
terrorism are worrisome issues for the U.S. Administration. 
  Fujimori said during the interview that in legal and 
penitentiary related matters, "Peru has also shown proof of a 
respect for human rights," but he admitted that the case of the 
10 people missing from Teachers College, also known as La 
Cantuta, is a "thorny" issue.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Peruvian economic developments monitored by Panama 
Bureau through 17 January; source follows in parentheses after 
item. 
  Guillermo Albareda, secretary of the Gold Committee of the 
National Mining Society (Sociedad Nacional de Mineria, SNM), has 
said that whereas Peru produced 18 tons of gold during 1992, it 
produced 28 tons during 1993. He added that 70 percent of the 
gold was obtained by new or expanded companies. Among the major 
investments he has cited were the Yanacocha Mine in Cajamarca 
Department, which the U.S. company Newmont Mining has been 
exploiting since last year, with an initial investment of $50 
million. He has also attributed the growth in this sector to 
expansion and modernization in the Retamas and La Poderosa 
Mines. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2042 GMT 12 Jan 94)

  [Text] Guatemala City, 17 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio explained today to his U.S. 
colleague, Bill Clinton, the decision to revise the functions of 
the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC], state paramilitary 
groups that humanitarian organizations accuse of violating human 
rights. 
  In a letter addressed today to Clinton and released by the 
Presidency Public Relations Office, De Leon said that he has 
ordered turning the PAC, which operate in areas that are no 
longer indispensable, into "Peace and Development Committees." 
  The patrols, which consist of civilians whom the Army equips 
and controls, were created during the defacto government of 
General Efrain Rios Montt (1982-83) to fight the guerrillas in 
the interior. 
  These groups, made up mostly of Indians, have been accused 
by 
national and international humanitarian organizations of 
committing abuses against the indigenous population, which is 
why they have demanded that the government dissolve them. 
  General Mario Enriquez, Guatemalan defense minister, has 
recognized that the Army has some 520,000 patrolmen in various 
parts of the country, supporting 40,000 soldiers of the Armed 
Forces. 
  In the letter, de Leon also tells Clinton of the "first big 
objective" of his agenda, which is to consolidate democracy and 
the state of law "as a part of political order," for which he 
appreciates the "support and permanent backing of the United 
States." 
  For it, he says, there is a commitment to respect human 
rights and the multicultural reality of the country, to fight 
impunity and corruption, to promote decentralization, and to 
promote the people's participation. 
  He also informed him of the recommendations by Christian 
Tomuschat, an expert UN human rights adviser, which have been 
fulfilled, such as the restructuring of the presidential general 
staff, a military group that was also accused of serious abuses 
and telephone espionage.

  [Text] Many deputies, particularly Unity [not further 
identified] faction members, have expressed their anger over 
alleged U.S. intervention through Political Affairs Adviser 
George Chester in the election of the new Congress Board of 
Directors. 
  According to the report, Chester has reportedly exerted 
pressure to have Deputy Carlos Acevedo excluded from the list 
headed by Vinicio Villar on which he appeared as a candidate to 
the post of first vice president of the Legislative Branch. 
  It was confirmed that the U.S. official went to the 
Legislative Palace yesterday afternoon and sat in the diplomatic 
box, where he talked with several deputies, including Cesar 
Porres and Rafael Rottmann of MAS [Solidarity Action Movement]. 
He was also seen talking with Carlos Acevedo shortly before 
Acevedo declined to run for first vice president. 
  The U.S. veto has reportedly occurred because Acevedo was 
included on a list of 16 deputies to be purged, and his election 
to such an important directorate board post would be considered 
"terrible." 
  When asked about this subject, Acevedo admitted that, in 
fact, he had been notified that the U.S. Embassy did not approve 
of his election, and that is why MAS demanded he decline the 
nomination, but he rejected the speculations, which caught most 
of the deputies' interest. 
  He believes "it was a false alarm, because I personally 
spoke 
with Mr. Chester and he assured me the embassy did not exert 
pressure." Besides, he said the diplomat told him he came to 
Congress only to observe the elections, to ascertain they were 
carried out within a democratic framework. 
  Acevedo has said he declined simply to remove an obstacle, 
to 
avoid being an obstruction, and to allow the negotiations to 
continue appropriately. Besides, he believes he has good 
relations with the U.S. Embassy, because he has even been 
praised for promoting the Narcotics Law and has been invited on 
numerous occasions to visit that North American country.

  [Text] Yesterday, presidential sources revealed that on 
Tuesday [11 January] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio decided to 
appoint Gladys Marithza Ruiz Sanchez de Vielman as foreign 
relations minister to replace Arturo Fajardo Maldonado. 
  The president held two meetings on Tuesday, one at 1000 with 
the current foreign minister and another at 1200 with Ruiz de 
Vielman, after which time he decided to make the cabinet change. 
  Mrs. Ruiz de Vielman, who is married to well-known banker 
Julio Vielman, has specialized in international affairs and is 
an expert in GATT issues. She is Guatemala's permanent 
negotiator to the EC on banana issues. She has held that post 
through three governments, during which time, in turn, there 
have been eight foreign ministers. This is because her work has 
been technical and satisfactory for official circles, according 
to the source who disclosed President de Leon's decision. The 
source, however, requested his name not be disclosed. 
  Mrs. Vielman has been a member of the board of directors of 
the Guatemalan Association of Lawyers and Notaries (1986) and 
president of the Association of Women Lawyers and Notaries. 
Currently, she is a member of the board of directors of the 
Guatemalan-American Institute and a member of the Center for the 
Defense of the Constitution. She will take the oath of office 
next Wednesday [19 January], and the president of the Republic 
will officially announce her appointment on 15 January. 
  The Coordinating Committee of Agricultural, Commercial, 
Industrial, and Financial Associations leadership met yesterday 
with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio to discuss the current 
economic situation and the results that could be obtained from 
the referendum. 
  It was learned that during the meeting with the business 
leaders, the president announced his government's plans for 
reactivating the economy for 1994-95 as well as some changes in 
his work team. 
  Other changes announced by the president include: Finance 
Minister Richard Aitkenhead will be replaced by economist Ana de 
Molina, who is the private secretary of the presidency of the 
Republic, and banker Eduardo Gonzalez Castillo will become the 
minister of economy. 
  De Leon Carpio also told the businessmen he was optimistic 
about the results of the referendum because he is sure the yes 
vote for constitutional reforms will win, and that the changes 
will improve the economic, political, and social picture of the 
country. The meeting was held at the presidential palace.

  [Text] Public workers began a series of demonstrations 
today, Friday, against a referendum slated for 30 January. 
Trade unions, human rights defense groups, and other people's 
organizations staged a demonstration to voice their opposition 
to the referendum, claiming that the changes to the Constitution 
do not meet their expectations. 
  The government employees unions which demonstrated this 
morning demanded a 40-percent salary increase, claiming that the 
price increases for consumer basket articles are extremely high 
compared to current salaries. Leaders of the government 
employees unions that participated in the demonstration 
announced that they are calling on all government employees 
unions to participate in a strike on 28 January. 
  The demonstration, which was slated to begin at 0900, did 
not 
start until 1030 because the demonstrators did not arrive on 
time. The leaders were forced to make emergency calls to begin 
the march that left from the El Trebol area and went down 
Bolivar Avenue to the downtown area. The demonstration ended at 
the main plaza. 
  The national police carefully watched the demonstration to 
prevent any infiltrations by other individuals. There were no 
problems during the demonstration.

<F P=106> [Report by Gonzalo Marroquin] </F>
  [Text] Guatemala City, 15 Jan (AFP) -- Just two weeks 
before the referendum to approve or reject the reforms to the 
Guatemalan Constitution, the "yes" and "no" campaigns have 
intensified, while division and uncertainty increase among 
Guatemalans. 
  With Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio at the head 
and backed by a million-dollar publicity campaign, the "yes" 
alternative has become stronger during the past weeks. The 
opposition is divided among those who support the "no" and those 
who are calling for abstentionism but do not have the resources 
to compete with the powerful publicity program displayed by the 
group calling for the "yes." 
  De Leon Carpio has told AFP "the yes will win" in the 30 
January referendum and said he was confident that "for the first 
time in Guatemala's history, a state's constitutional mandate 
will be interrupted without using force or measures of coup 
d'etat." 
  The only poll published up to now is the one by the magazine 
CRONICA. It has revealed that 70 percent of the people 
registered to participate in the referendum supports the 
approval of the constitutional reforms, although most people, 
not only in the rural areas but in the capital city too, are not 
familiar with the reforms they will approve. 
  Among the reforms--43 in all, including temporary 
articles--is the reduction of the legislative period for 
deputies and Supreme Court justices. Those two arguments 
strengthen the official campaign, which emphasizes "the exit of 
the deputies" who have been accused repeatedly of corruption. 
  The following political parties have joined the group that 
supports approval of the reforms: Guatemalan Republican Front 
(FRG), Union of the National Center (UCN), and Nationalist 
Authentic Central (CAN). The Guatemalan Christian Democracy 
(DCG) and other minority organizations will soon join officially 
the yes group. 
  Furthermore, and although it has not been stated openly, the 
business sector, which is represented by the Coordinating 
Committee for Agriculture, Commercial, Financial and Industrial 
Associations (CACIF), the Catholic Church, and the Army, 
apparently also support the yes vote. 
  Meanwhile, the opposition is too divided and does not have 
the resources to obtain positive results, according to 
Guatemalan political analysts. The "no" vote has been openly 
favored by the National Vanguard Party (PAN), the Guatemalan 
Workers' General Central Organization (CGTG), and several media 
sectors. 
  The largest opposition is in the people's organizations, and 
those reject holding the referendum. This sector includes the 
so-called Multisectorial Social Forum (FMS) [Foro Multisectorial 
Social] and the Labor and Popular Action Union (UASP). 
Approximately 1,500 peasants from those organizations marched to 
oppose the referendum on 14 January. The UASP has also warned 
that it will take "measures" to boycott the voting process and 
has threatened to place barricades and seize buildings to draw 
the people's attention. 
  All of those actions seem to be insufficient to stop the 
victory of the "yes" vote, however, because, in addition to the 
strong publicity campaign in its favor, it is expected that the 
government will transport people to vote in the interior of the 
country. Local analysts estimate that at least 50 percent of 
the 3.4 million Guatemalans who can participate in the process 
will cast their vote, although there is a large amount of people 
who have no possibility of knowing the reforms to the 
Constitution, as they can neither read nor write.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 13 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Christian 
Democratic Deputy Marco Vinicio Villar Anleu on 12 January was 
elected president of the Guatemalan National Congress to replace 
fellow Christian Democrat Jose Fernando Lobo Dubon. 
  Villar Anleu, who represents the northern Quiche Department 
and is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, won the 
support of 70 of the 91 deputies who attended the regular 
evening session of Congress. 
  The Guatemalan Christian Democracy [DCG], the Solidarity 
Action Movement [MAS], dissidents of the Union of the National 
Center [UNC], the Guatemalan Republican Front [FRG], and 
minority parties supported Villar's slate, made up of three vice 
presidents and eight secretaries. 
  DCG Secretary Alfonso Cabrera and Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla 
Vega, who returned to his seat on 12 January after losing an eye 
in an attack in May 1993, headed the negotiations to draw up 
Villar's slate. 
  Villar, who was head of the DCG bloc last year, ran against 
the slate headed by Carlos Perez Castaneda and made up of UCN 
and FRG candidates, which received the remaining 21 votes. 
  Neither the 12 deputies of the National Vanguard Party (PAN) 
who had resigned nor their alternates attended the regular 
session headed by Lobo Dubon. 
  Villar will be sworn in on 14 January by Lobo Dubon, who 
acknowledged Villar's victory on 12 January at a solemn session. 
One of Villar's first tasks will be to listen to the government 
report that President Ramiro De Leon Carpio will present on 15 
January. 
  This directorate will not complete its one-year term as 
established by the Constitution because if the yes vote wins in 
the 30 January referendum, Guatemalans will elect a new Congress 
this year. 
  The Congress Directorate is composed as follows: 
  President: Marco Vinicio Villar (DCG) 
  First Vice President: Jorge Alberto Monroy (formerly of UCN) 
  Second Vice President: Marco Tulio Merida (MAS) 
  Third Vice President: Juan Francisco Alfaro (formerly of 
UCN) 
  First Secretary: Clodoveo Dominguez (DCG) 
  Second Secretary: Eduardo Mendez Pinelo (formerly of UCN) 
  Third Secretary: Francisco Reyes Ixcamey (formerly of 
FRG) 
  Fourth Secretary: Rafael Oliveros Ramirez (MAS) 
  Fifth Secretary: Edna de Ruano (formerly of UCN) 
  Sixth Secretary: Felipe Franco Trujillo (MAS) 
  Seventh Secretary: Pedro Gomez Chavez (formerly of UCN) 
  Eighth Secretary: Jose Aguirre Quinteros (PID)

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondents in Colonia, Uruguay] </F>
  [Text] Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy has 
obtained assurances from his Brazilian counterpart Itamar Franco 
that customs restrictions to bilateral trade enforced by 
Brazilian officials that amount to a virtual intimidation 
campaign -- through the confiscation of commodities purchased 
by Brazilian citizens at the Paraguayan city of Ciudad del Este 
-- "will be immediately revised and that the appropriate 
corrective measures will be adopted to end this situation that 
runs contrary to the integration process between Paraguay and 
Brazil." 
  Early yesterday morning, before the opening of the Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South] summit, Wasmosy conveyed this 
problem to Franco based on a protest note submitted to him by 
Ciudad del Este Mayor Guillermo Campuzano and by the Foz do 
Yguazu-based Parana-Paraguay Chamber of Commerce. The note 
charges Brazilian customs officials with a harassment campaign 
"that has caused a major reduction in the flow of tourists to 
Foz do Yguazu and Ciudad del Este, with the subsequent reduction 
in sales for stores, hotels, and restaurants." The drop in 
business has been estimated at nearly 40 percent.

  [Excerpts] Retired Brigadier General Juan Ramon Rosa 
Rodriguez was installed this morning as the new National 
Antinarcotics Secretariat (Senad) executive secretary, replacing 
Division General Mario Escobar Anzoategui, who tendered his 
resignation last year. 
  Rosa Rodriguez is a military officer who went into 
retirement 
a few years ago and served in the 3d Army Corps. Rosa Rodriguez 
took a course on drug trafficking in the United States. 
Therefore, he is supported by the U.S. diplomatic mission. 
  The president of the Republic, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, took 
considerable time in appointing the Senad head. The Senad 
reshuffle prompted "diplomatic" frictions between Wasmosy and 
U.S. ambassador to Paraguay Jon David Glassman. 
  It was actually the U.S. ambassador who announced that the 
new Senad head would be appointed sometime this week, at the 
latest. According to military sources, there were three 
candidates: One of them rejected the post and the other two 
were not approved by the U.S. mission. [passage omitted] 
  The president of the Republic, engineer Juan Carlos Wasmosy, 
has given "absolute liberty" to the new Senad head, retired Gen. 
Juan Ramon Rosa Rodriguez for the latter to properly discharge 
his new duties. Rosa Rodriguez noted that if he does not 
properly discharge his duties, it will not be because he is 
unwilling to do so, but because he does not have the elements 
required for it. 
  The president said: "I fully trust you and I ask everyone 
here and all the organizations to provide the support required 
for an all-out struggle against money laundering and crime." 
  Addressing Gen. Rosa Rodriguez, the president added: "You 
have all my support and the support of all levels of government 
to fight this scourge without any protection. [sentence as 
published] You have absolute liberty and the support of the 
national government to fight this evil." 
  Moving on, the president thanked U.S. Ambassador Jon 
Glassman 
for the assistance the U.S. Embassy has supplied our country to 
fight drug trafficking "because, sadly enough, our country is 
being used by criminals as a transit country." 
  The president concluded by saying: "I hope that all of us, 
united, some day may be able to wipe out this damned trafficking 
from America's Southern Cone." 
  Rosa Rodriguez 
  The new Senad head said: "Thank you very much for trusting 
me, Mr. President. I cannot promise more than dedication and 
honest effort, but I can assure you that if Senad does not 
properly meet your expectations, it will never be because of ill 
will, laziness, or malice, but it will be because our capacity 
and our means are not enough to fulfill your wishes." 
  This may be interpreted as a call to re-equip Senad, whose 
potential, according to Senad Assistant Secretary Colonel Cirilo 
Velazquez, is very small compared with drug traffickers' 
potential.

Gutierrez by reporter J.J. Pinilla at the Council of State 
offices in Santa Fe de Bogota on 18 January; from the "National" 
newscast -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Pinilla] Your attention, please. The Council of 
State has just asked the government for an explanation regarding 
the overflight of foreign aircraft and the presence of U.S. 
troops in our country. Mr. Amado Gutierrez, president of the 
Council of State, what have you requested of the president? 
  [Gutierrez] The petition, which was approved unanimously 
during a plenary Council meeting, requests the president to 
inform us about the legal conditions under which he granted 
authorization for several military aircraft to overfly the city 
of Barranquilla and for foreign troops to remain in several 
areas of the country. 
  [Pinilla] Why has the Council of State made such a request? 
  [Gutierrez] The Council of State made the request because 
the 
Constitution expressly states that while the Senate is in 
recess, the movement of foreign troops may only be authorized by 
the president, with prior approval by the Council of State. 
  [Pinilla] Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Amado Gutierrez, 
new president of the Council of State.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 18 Jan (DPA) -- Pumping 
operations for crude oil through two of the most important 
Colombian oil pipelines are completely paralyzed, Ecopetrol 
[Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] spokesmen have reported. 
  One of the oil pipelines, which goes from the oil wells in 
Cano Limon in the eastern part of the country to the Caribbean 
port of Covenas, was dynamited by the pro-Cuban National 
Liberation Army (ELN) in the northern Department of Cesar. The 
pipeline, which is 780 km long and has the capacity to pump up 
to 250,000 barrels of crude oil, suffered a breakdown, which 
caused 5,000 barrels to be spilled and a subsequent fire. 
  In addition, there is serious ecological destruction that is 
being controlled by Ecopetrol emergency technicians and workers. 
So far this year it is the fourth attack on the Cano 
Limon-Covenas Pipeline, which has been the target of attacks by 
the ELN. Last year the ELN blew it up 39 times. 
  Meanwhile, the Colombia Oil Pipeline, which pumps crude from 
the northwestern Department of Antioquia to the port of Covenas, 
was damaged by an explosive device in Remedios Municipality, 
Antioquia Department. The oil pipeline, the second most 
important one in the country, has been blown up three times this 
year. Last year it was attacked 10 times by the ELN. 
  The aforementioned guerrilla group's attacks on the oil 
pipelines are part of its "war" on President Cesar Gaviria's oil 
policy, which the rebel group believes is hurting Colombian 
interests.

<F P=106> [Report by Edgar Augusto Sanchez in Cesar Department; from </F>
the "TV Today Newscast"] 
  [Text] Guerrilla members and smugglers have apparently 
created an alliance against customs guards in Santander and 
Cesar Departments. Seventeen customs officials have been 
assassinated in those departments during the last two years. As 
a precaution, the guards now remain at a distance of up to 10 km 
from the dirt roads used to bring contraband into the country. 
  These roads are in bad condition, but they are the safest 
and 
most reliable for smugglers. A sizable part of the alcoholic 
beverages and cigarettes which negatively affect the economy in 
Santander Department are brought into the department using these 
roads. The dusty roads are suitable for smugglers because they 
are located in so-called conflict-ridden areas, where various 
guerrilla fronts freely operate. Obviously, due to security 
reasons, customs representatives never go there. 
  [Begin Santander Finance Secretary Angel de Jesus Becerra 
recording] They know they cannot go out and conduct operations 
without coordinating everything first to ensure that they are 
properly backed up by public security forces. [end recording] 
  "TV Today" newscast toured the area and observed vehicles 
turning off from the main highway to avoid checkpoints. 
Official intelligence sources emphasized that the alliance 
between smugglers and guerrilla groups was formed to smuggle 
merchandise. Only two highway policemen manned the checkpoints 
on the road to Cucuta. 
  [Begin unidentified policeman recording] We have learned 
that guerrilla forces blew up the next post. That is the way 
things are around here. They operate around here and in Los 
Colorados. [end recording] 
  Given the roads' geographical location, customs guards do 
not 
dare enter the zone for fear of losing their lives.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Hernan Jose Guzman, Commander of the </F>
Army, by John Gutierrez; place and date not given: "Guzman: `The 
Guerrillas Want To Be the Third Cartel'"] 
  [Excerpt] "The Army Has No Interest in Covering Up 
Any Crime." 
  [Passage omitted] [Gutierrez] How would you rate your 
performance in 1993? 
  [Guzman] We have made progress on meeting the goals that we 
set. This is borne out by the results achieved in our country 
this year (see below), both in terms of action waged against 
terrorists as well as against organized crime and drug 
trafficking. We got rid of nearly 1,000 terrorists and captured 
1,873 guerrillas. In addition, the Medellin Cartel has been 
brought to its knees by the National Police and Escobar was 
killed. 
  [Gutierrez] Not all sectors see the crack in the guerrilla 
organization so clearly. 
  [Guzman] We have made progress this year on breaking up the 
guerrilla organization thanks to the intervention of the 
Prosecutor General's Office. Without its help, we would not have 
been able to put that many terrorists behind bars. Charges have 
been filed against every one of them and their illegal 
activities are being spelled out in detail. We have filed our 
evidence and those guerrillas will be brought before the courts. 
  [Gutierrez] In practice, is there not more than one area off 
limits to the Army? 
  [Guzman] No. To date, no area has been declared off limits 
to 
the Army. The Army has gone in and enforced the law. I can give 
you one example: In the San Lucas Mountains, funds for the ELN 
[Army of National Liberation] came from gold mining and cocaine 
operations and the Army went in and took control of the 
situation. The same is true of San Jose del Guaviare. We cleaned 
the area out. 
  [Gutierrez] But we are still seeing videos of terrorist 
summit conferences in areas under the jurisdiction of the Mobile 
Brigades, the antiterrorist forces. 
  [Guzman] That is all highly relative. The videos that they 
are showing us are not at all authentic. It is easy to stage a 
meeting in the jungle in two or three days. They can easily meet 
and immediately break up again and that is what happened. 
  In some cases in which we went in on the basis of 
information 
that we had, the individuals had already held their meeting and 
left. It is all highly relative when one is operating in a 
jungle area. There you have to move troops by helicopter and 
sometimes, for any number of reasons, you may not have the 
logistics in place and be forced to postpone the mission for 24 
hours. In such cases, when an operation is postponed, those 
elements immediately change their plans. 
  [Gutierrez] How do the troops view the process that began 
with the [Socialist Renewal] Current (CRS)? 
  [Guzman] As very positive. I wish that other terrorist 
organizations would hear us and understand the importance of 
peace. I think that that is the best way, the solution chosen by 
the previous terrorist groups and the one now being used by the 
CRS. It believes that the most positive option is unquestionably 
to engage in dialogue and a favorable solution for the nation. 
  [Gutierrez] What about the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces 
of Colombia] and the ELN? 
  [Guzman] I think that what is happening in this case is that 
the terrorists do not want to even hear about any dialogue, 
which is an enormous mistake because they have not allowed the 
conditions to be created for the National Government to take the 
position of talking with them. They have always played tricks. 
  Now all the guerrillas want to do is engage in extortion, 
steal livestock from ranches, actively engage in actual drug 
trafficking, and become the third-ranking drug cartel in order 
to finance their activities. 
  [Gutierrez] Does that explain attacks like the last one in 
Guican? 
  [Guzman] The guerrillas as such have been defeated for quite 
some time. Now they are acting like the rings that engage in 
common crime, drug trafficking, and terrorism. I can guarantee 
that these organizations have reached one of their lowest points 
ever because we are hitting them everywhere. 
  Such actions can only be explained when dealing with a ring 
of criminals. Drug traffickers attack anything they can and the 
FARC and ELN care about absolutely nothing. In Sumapaz, they 
machine-gunned an ambulance even though it was properly 
identified, which shows a total lack of respect for human rights 
in general. 
  They hide behind the shield of human rights of which they 
themselves are the worst violators.... The terrorists have 
distorted information in order to discredit the Armed Forces and 
the Police for alleged irregular conduct. 
  [Gutierrez] The Attorney General's Office agrees on this, 
but 
the organization has also filed a number of isolated complaints 
against members of the Armed Forces. 
  [Guzman] I think we have made great progress in this area 
this year. We have drafted regulations and convinced our people 
that they must respect human rights. 
  That business about the Attorney General's Office "syndrome" 
has disappeared. The Ministry of Justice has proceeded with 
total transparency. Some investigations have even been conducted 
jointly. 
  In the case of Riofrio, for example, we turned our 
investigation over to the Attorney General's Office, as we did 
in the case of Uraba. There, the Armed Forces inspector and 
deputy attorney general worked together. 
  The Army has absoslutely no interest in covering up any 
crime 
or any alleged crime that we are said to have committed. We 
shall not hesitate to discipline or impose criminal penalties on 
those guilty of irregular conduct. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  [Box, p 10C] </H5>
<H5>  The Record </H5>
  The following is a record of the Army's achievements in its 
war on crime in 1993, as of 22 December: 
  Guerrillas: 993 guerrillas killed; 1,873 guerrillas 
captured; 
over 5 tons of explosives seized; 1,863 short and long arms 
weapons seized from terrorists; 78 radios seized from 
guerrillas; 173 grenades confiscated, hand-held or fired from 
weapons; nearly 100 tons of food; 368 guerrilla camps destroyed; 
over 2,000 armed skirmishes; 248 troops killed in fighting. 
  Drug trafficking: 632 persons captured, including 629 
nationals and three foreigners; 28 persons killed in 
confrontations inside the country; 373 short and long arms 
seized; 37,815 shells of different calibers; 106 laboratories 
destroyed. 
  Drugs seized: 3,633 kilos of cocaine; 2 kilos of morphine; 
21,190 kilos of marijuana; 47 kilos of poppy latex; 158,533 
kilos of coca leaves; 126 kilos of bazuco; 165 kilos of poppy 
seed; 525 hectares of coca destroyed; 272 hectares of poppies 
destroyed; 47 hectares of marijuana destroyed.

  [Text] Chilean Ambassador to Peru Alejandro Magnet has told 
COOPERATIVA that the Chilean-Peruvian talks on the Lima 
Convention have been suspended. 
  [Begin recording] [Magnet] I cannot disclose anything 
because 
sessions are secret, it was the sessions of the... 
  [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] But did you submit a 
report? Can you tell us about that? 
  [Magnet] I was invited to the session. 
  [Reporter] What is the current status of the agreements 
between Chile and Peru on the Lima Convention? 
  [Magnet] The meetings have been suspended. A decision has 
been made to wait. [end recording] 
  The ambassador said this after attending a meeting that was 
presided over by Foreign Minister Enrique Silva Cimma. The 
talks on the Lima Convention were on the meeting's agenda. 
  The Lima Convention, which was signed on 11 May 1993, seeks 
to resolve matters that are pending from the 1929 Treaty, and 
includes the construction by Chile of facilities at the port of 
Arica. 
  Chilean representatives at the talks (Luis Vinter) and 
(Eduardo Biogrossi) read briefings during the closed-door 
session. Members of the foreign affairs committee of the 
Chamber of Deputies also attended. Committee Chairman Jorge 
Pizarro said that the Chamber of Deputies agreed that the Lima 
Convention must be ratified in its entirety, the way it was 
approved by the Chilean Senate. 
  Deputy Teodoro Ribera commented on specific topics. 
  [Begin recording] [Ribera] We believe we should wait until 
the El Chinchorro issue is resolved through one of the 
agreements signed in Lima. If that cannot be implemented, 
however, Chile should obviously resort to the powers granted by 
the law and the Constitution to resolve Arica's urban problem. 
The state should thus use its powers as it would with any 
private party, be it an individual or a corporation. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will the Chilean Government pay 
compensation for the land that we have occupied in El Chinchorro. 
  [Ribera] Without doubt. We are not speaking here... [changes 
pattern] Chile always pays compensation for expropriations. A 
fair price that will be negotiated, and if there is no 
agreement, the price will be decided by a judge. 
  It is not a matter of expropriating without paying 
compensation. We will simply implement the powers granted to the 
Revenue Department and to the Chilean State under Articles 19 
and 24 of the Constitution, which establish expropriation for 
reasons of public need. [end recording] 
  The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies 
decided to suspend a visit to Lima to meet its Peruvian peers, 
because of the recess in the Peruvian Constituent Congress.

possession permitted the breakup of an important terrorist plan. 
It was reported that one of the targets was the Defense Ministry 
building. 
  The two arrested extremists were transferred to the 
Investigative Police central headquarters this morning. The 
terrorists were identified as Juan Moreno Benegas and (Nualdo 
Carreno Vatienza), members of the so-called Free Fatherland 
People's Guerrilla Army. The two were placed at the disposal of 
the court today. 
  The Investigative Police said the two are responsible for 
many robberies and attacks. The police also ascertained that the 
group planned a series of extremist attacks in cooperation with 
the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] and Lautaro 
[Lautaro Rebel and Popular Front] in reprisal for the imminent 
transfer of terrorist prisoners to a maximum security prison. 
  [Begin Police Deputy Superintendent Zvonco Tocigl recording] 
They planned to harass police barracks and attack public 
buildings. The plan included an attack against the Diego 
Portales Building [Defense Ministry] in March. [end recording] 
  The Investigative Police announced on 17 January that the 
terrorists had in their possession arms and explosives, 
including two submachine guns, one pistol, one revolver, 
dynamite, and grenades.

America and the Caribbean. Ambassador Carlos Portales signed the 
document for the president of the Republic. 
  The Chilean Government also has joined the organization 
supervising the treaty -- the Organization to Ban Nuclear 
Weapons in Latin America, OPANAL. The ceremony took place in 
Mexico City. Argentina joined the treaty during the same 
ceremony. 
  Portales said on the occasion that Chile emphasizes its 
complete renunciation and repudiation of the proliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, adding that the country will 
contribute with initiatives seeking to prevent the proliferation 
of these types of weapons. 
  Chile ratified the Tlatelolco Treaty in October 1974, seven 
years after signing it. Its implementation, however, was 
suspended because Chile considered that all countries with 
nuclear programs in the region had to become an effective part 
of the agreement.

<F P=106> [Article by Carmen Pignotti] </F>
  [Excerpt] The focus of international co-operation should 
spread from politics and economics to the environment, President 
Carlos Menem said last night [17 January] at the opening session 
of a world conservation summit in Buenos Aires. 
  Menem, who described the environment as the key issue facing 
humanity, said global action was crucial to turn the current 
tide of depletion of natural resources. 
  "Little by little, the era of wars is being overcome, we owe 
it to ourselves now to leave behind the wars against nature, 
which are also wars against us," Menem told delegates to the 
19th general assembly of the World Conservation Union (IUCN). 
  Among its immediate plans for environmental action, 
Argentina 
will upgrade its federal Environment Secretariat to ministerial 
rank and create a new 70,000-hectare natural reserve in San Juan 
province, Menem announced. 
  The "El Leoncito" reserve will provide protection to several 
ecosystem and will be run by the National Parks Administration. 
Menem noted the reserve's creation would mark the 90th 
anniversary of the country's first national park, Nahuel Huapi. 
  Describing the environment as a priority on his agenda, 
Menem 
said plans to create a ministry in charge of the environment 
would be crystallized after the much-vaunted reform of the 
National Constitution. 
  The IUCN assembly -- an event held every three years -- 
brings together delegates from over 800 governments, state 
agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) from some 125 
countries for a 10-day marathon of special seminars, plenary 
debates and workshops. 
  Menem described the current assembly in Buenos Aires, the 
largest gathering of world environmental leaders since the 
United Nations Earth Summit in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, as "a 
unique opportunity to start generating a model for civilization 
that will maintain the harmony of the planet." 
  "Ecology is not only one of the issues attracting the 
interest of the world, it is the main issue that humanity should 
be taking care of," said Menem. 
  Delivering the keynote address at the assembly's 
inauguration, outgoing IUCN President Sir Shridath Ramphal 
placed the stress of today's environmental problems on the 
issues of consumption and population, undergoing the weaknesses 
of the Earth Summit. 
  The Rio summit produced two international conventions and a 
detailed plan for action, known as Agenda 21. 
  "The silence guilt, a forlorn hope that if decisions can be 
deferred long enough and solutions sought in other directions, 
changing the lifestyles of the rich may not after all be 
necessary. But silence does not change reality," Sir Shridath 
declared. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Castries, St. Lucia, 18 Jan, CANA -- Some Caribbean 
delegates are down to attend the 19th triennial general assembly 
of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) that was opening in 
Buenos Aires, Argentina, Tuesday. 
  The Caribbean delegates include Yves Renard, executive 
director of the Caribbean Natural Resource Institute (CANARI), 
who served as regional representative on the IUCN council, and 
David Smith, executive director of the Jamaica Conservation 
Development Trust. 
  Lynn Holowesko, of the Bahamas National Trust, and 
representatives of several other governmental agencies and non- 
governmental organisations in the Caribbean are also listed to 
attend the meeting. 
  They will be joined by other leading experts on the 
environment and development from around the world, to discuss 
the major environmental issues of the time, a statement from 
CANARI said. 
  The theme for the January 18-26 meeting is "Caring for the 
Earth and Its People." 
  Participants will address issues such as the implementation 
of the convention of biological diversity, the formulation of 
policies on the sustainable utilisation of living natural 
resources, and the incorporation of environmental care in human 
ethics, CANARI added. 
  They will also explore "the Caribbean experiences and its 
approaches to conservation, natural resource management and 
sustainble development." 
  Every three years, members of the IUCN get together to set 
the policy and direction that the union will follow over the 
next three years.

  [Text] San Jose, 15 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- President Rafael Angel 
Calderon said today Costa Rica will continue its struggle to get 
better conditions in European markets for all banana producing 
nations. Calderon regretted that Ecuador, Panama, Guatemala, 
and Honduras did not attend the 13 January banana producers' 
meeting in Costa Rica "to help find a joint position" against 
the commercial restrictions of the European Union (EU). 
  Last December the EU offered to increase the Latin American 
producers' annual banana import quota by 10 percent. The quotas 
were set last July at 2 million tons with a high tariff on the 
surplus. The EU also proposed to distribute 70 percent of its 
import licenses among these nations by establishing fixed quotas 
for each country. Through this mechanism Europe seeks the 
withdrawal of charges filed by the area's producers before a 
GATT panel. 
  Costa Rica summoned the banana producers to a meeting but 
Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama did not attend because 
they consider that any regional proposal should follow the GATT 
decision on the dispute. 
  Calderon told NOTIMEX: "Costa Rica will continue its 
struggle to get better conditions in the European market to 
benefit not only the Latin American nations but also the 
Caribbean producers." The president said that Colombia, Costa 
Rica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela will seek median formulas to 
guarantee a satisfactory solution for everyone. 
  Foreign Trade Minister Alberto Rojas said the problem was 
serious because "a GATT panel resolution did not obligate Europe 
and its enforcement could take years, with irreparable damage to 
the producers."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Costa Rica's economic developments monitored through 
18 January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas has reported that, 
according to preliminary figures, imports amounted to $1.970 
billion and exports to $1.975 billion in 1993. He noted that 
exports increased $400 million (17 percent) over the previous 
year. Rojas added that despite problems, banana exports had 
increased $40 million, meat exports $26 million, and plants and 
flowers exports $15 million. The foreign trade minister also 
reported that the GNP had increased 6.5 percent. (San Jose LA 
REPUBLICA in Spanish 8 Jan 94 p 15A) 
  Central Bank President Jorge Corrales returned from a 
meeting 
with IMF officials in Washington on 7 January. He reported that 
the fiscal targets for 1993 had not been met because the 
economic adjustment program had failed to yield an expected $95 
million, which was to be used to replace domestic debt with 
foreign financing. He asserted, however, that the targets 
agreed upon with the IMF would be met easily and that the bank's 
international reserves amounted to $945.5 million on 31 
December. He highlighted that revenue from exports, tourism, 
and foreign investment had covered payments for goods and 
services imports; the nearly total cancellation of the foreign 
debt, including $90 million owed to the Paris Club; and the 
increase of the country's foreign exchange reserves. (San Jose 
LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 8 Jan 94 p 14A) 
  Central Bank President Jorge Corrales reported that Costa 
Rica's economy registered a substantial increase of 6.3 percent 
in 1993. He said the effects of the increase were starting to 
benefit the people, and he cited a General Directorate of 
Statistics and Census report that revealed that 50,000 new jobs 
opened in the country last year, prompting prompted the 
percentage of poor people in the country to decrease from 24.5 
percent in 1991 to 17.4 percent in 1993. Corrales said the 
unemployment rate was "one of the lowest in America -- only 4.4 
percent." He added that the consumer price index had decreased 
from 25 percent in 1991 to 9 percent in 1993 and that inflation 
had dropped from 12 percent to 9.8 percent. He said an 
important factor in the development of the country had been the 
drop in the public sector's overall deficit from 5.4 percent of 
GNP in 1990 to 2 percent in 1991, 1.4 percent in 1992, and 1.3 
percent in 1993. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0027 GMT 13 Jan 
94) 
  The government Exports and Investments Promotion Center 
today 
reported that North American countries bought almost 50 percent 
($1.025 billion) of the country's total exports in 1993. The 
official organization reported that the second most important 
region was the European Union, which purchased 24 percent of the 
exports, while the Central American region bought 17 percent 
($348 million) of the total exports last year. The center 
highlighted that exports to Mexico had increased from $17 
million in 1992 to $63 million in 1993. Meanwhile, exports to 
Chile rose from $4 million in 1992 to $10 million last year. 
The export sector increased 17 percent last year mainly because 
of a rise in tourism, an activity that generated an average of 
$40 million a month, which is only surpassed by the nation's 
banana revenues. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1653 GMT 15 Jan

<F P=106> [News conference by Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani </F>
with domestic reporters and unidentified moderator at the 
Presidency in San Salvador -- live] 
  [Text] [Unidentified reporter] Mr. President, there has 
been some speculation lately as to a possible drop in gasoline 
prices. Could you please confirm this and tell us how much? I 
also have another question. Has the government decided to 
support the candidacy of Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister 
Bernd Niehaus for the post of OAS secretary general? 
  [Cristiani] There is no final word on fuel prices yet. Right 
now we are in the final negotiations stage with the oil 
companies to open up or liberate oil imports or their finished 
byproducts. In other words, fuels that do not necessarily 
require handling by RASA [Autonomous Refinery of El Salvador]. 
RASA is an enterprise that has two of the main oil companies as 
shareholders. There is another oil company that has requested 
permission to import finished products. We have been waiting 
because this requires facilities and these are being built by 
the company in Acajutla. We believe the negotiations on how the 
free import scheme is to operate should be finished in the next 
two weeks. The government would still retain certain controls, 
although not in pricing. 
  This is a complicated matter not just because of refining 
but 
because of the San Jose Pact, which is an agreement between 
governments. We believe, however, that with the drop in oil 
prices it is quite possible that when the prices are liberated 
these in turn will drop. The question remains as to how much and 
I cannot say right now. Current prices are based on, I believe, 
$19 a barrel, and I understand the price is approximately $17 
right now. Do not take these as hard and fast figures, but more 
or less this is the proportion. The idea is to take advantage of 
the liberalization and not have the government, like what has 
been done in the past, fix prices. 
  Regarding support to Bernd Niehaus' candidacy, an agreement 
was signed during the presidential meeting in Nicaragua, wherein 
we Central Americans pledged to support him. El Salvador 
continues supporting Bernd Niehaus' candidacy. 
  [Moderator] Jorge Barahona, Teleprensa. 
  [Barahona] [words indistinct] public workers will get a new 
wage increase. We would like to know when will this become 
effective and what will be the amount? 
  [Cristiani] We believe that the increase will be sometime in 
the middle of the fiscal year. We must remember the budget does 
not include a specified amount for wage increases. Savings, 
however, have been made from the time the budget was implemented 
to meet this increase. The other thing that must be taken into 
consideration is no amount has been decided on, but we would try 
to match the yearly inflation rate taking into account the 
latest rate and the projected one to try and ensure public 
workers are not unduly affected in their purchasing power, and 
that they even receive a real increase, like last year. 
  These are the overall parameters, but naturally, we have the 
defense minister [chuckles] [pauses] I mean the finance 
minister, who analyzes how the budget itself is executed. We are 
sure we will be able to grant a wage increase about the middle 
of the year. Logically, our administration ends 1 June, so we 
would have to decide on the increase before, even though it 
becomes effective after we leave office, but bear in mind that 
we cannot leave a budget problem for the new administration. 
  Regrettably, when we took office we were left with a 
completely unbalanced budget. You will recall that during the 
electoral campaign all public workers got an unbudgeted 200 
colon increase. When the second half of the fiscal year came, 
which was when we took office, there were no funds. This became 
a very serious problem. We do not want to leave this sort of 
problem. If we grant an increase it will be because the funds 
are available. 
  [Moderator] Mauricio Ramirez from Megavision. 
  [Ramirez] Mr. President, in light of FMLN's [Farabundo Marti 
National Liberation Front] concern -- the left-wing's concern 
about not having representatives in the department juntas, an 
FMLN delegation has traveled to the United Nations. Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal [TSE] magistrates have said the United 
Nations have no say in the country's electoral affairs. Would 
your government be willing to follow UN secretary general 
recommendations? 
  [Cristiani] We, as the government, have nothing whatosever 
to 
do with electoral topics. You must remember the peace agreements 
changed the Central Election Council to the TSE, raising the 
member to the rank of magistrate. The law specifies that the TSE 
magistrates are the only ones who can interpret or execute the 
electoral law. The electoral law is also the result of the peace 
agreements, therefore not only was it raised to the rank of 
tribunal and the peace agreements yielded an electoral code, but 
the TSE was formed as a formula resulting from the peace 
agreements. Perhaps we should take into account that the result 
is nothing more than what the TSE has considered the current law 
should be. We, as the government, have nothing whatsoever to do 
with this and do not plan to exert any influence one way or the 
other. 
  What has been done over the weekend was to hold an ARENA 
[Nationalist Republican Alliance] party meeting to study the 
FMLN-Democratic Convergence [CD] coalition request. We consider 
their claim as a political party is partly justified. I believe 
ARENA is going to do something about this. Their claim is partly 
justified when one takes into account the complexity of the 
various coalitions or the ways they are participating in the 
elections, and this is where, I believe, the main problem lies, 
and where the TSE does not have much latitude. 
  Upon examining the electoral code and its reforms, perhaps 
what takes place every 15 years was not taken into account. In 
other words, if we think of elections only in terms of the 
president, or if elections for deputies and mayors are only 
held, which is what normally takes place in the country, then 
there would be no problem because it would be a single 
coalition, and therefore the current electoral code covers it. 
When studying this in comparison with ARENA, we saw there are 
gaps when both types of elections are held simultaneously every 
15 years. We believe the FMLN-CD coalition is partly correct in 
their claim. We do not think their complete claim is justified; 
they want more than they deserve. 
  I am not going to take a stand on this now; this will be up 
to the party. ARENA is willing to discuss certain methods of 
resolving this problem. The United Nations is not in a position 
to interpret our electoral code. This task pertains only to the 
TSE. We believe it is a mistake to run and get outside help 
everytime a domestic problem arises. It is as if we need to 
complain to someone abroad and have someone resolve our 
problems. I think these problems need to be resolved 
domestically. To my way of thinking this has no other purpose 
than to stir things up for propaganda purposes. I repeat, the 
party studied this and their claim is partly justified. I 
believe this problem can be resolved. 
  [Moderator] Mr. President, the last question is from Mario 
Jovel from the "Up to Date" newscast. 
  [Jovel] Mr. President, which parties in the Electoral Code 
are you referring to when simultaneous elections for president, 
vice president, deputies and mayors are held? The other question 
is: Does the government have information on Salvadorans who 
could have suffered in the Los Angeles, California earthquake? 
The third question is: When will the deployment of the [words 
indistinct] in Santa Tecla and Cuzcatlan? 
  [Cristiani] When I mentioned the complexity of the electoral 
process, it was in regard to the following. There are problems 
with the diverse coalitions because in one department they can 
be participating as political parties -- individually -- 
however, at the same time they could be part of another 
candidacy within a coalition formed by those same parties in 
which they are participating individually. For example, in the 
San Salvador Department or at national level, the CD as well as 
the FMLN participate as political parties individually for 
deputies. Nevertheless, for the presidential ticket, they do not 
participate as individual parties; they participate nationwide 
as a coalition. We believe this can be partially resolved so all 
interests -- individual as well as coalitions' interests -- can 
be represented in the department juntas or have representation 
in the department juntas to oversee the interests of the 
individual party as well as of the coalitions. This would be 
without duplicating representatives because this would mean 
wanting to have more than what is allowed. This makes reference 
to all those who form a coalition. 
  Up to now we only have knowledge of seven different 
coalitions in seven departments. I am not sure how all of this 
has been worked out. They organized a mix up of sorts. They are 
running individually on one side and in a coalition on the 
other. It is legal to form coalitions, no one is questioning 
this; however, this is what has probably created the problem. In 
addition to the fact that the Electoral Code did not foresee 
these general elections for president, vice president as well as 
for deputies and mayors at the same time. 
  One has a tendency to think of the elections in terms of 
only 
for president and vice president or only for mayors and 
deputies. This has been the general rule. Nevertheless, any 
party that forms a coalition in this fashion -- that is, a 
persons runs individually on one side and in a coalition for 
another candidacy -- will face the same problem. I believe this 
can be resolved by having representatives on the juntas. This 
was analyzed within ARENA. The party has offered to do something 
to avoid problems with this. 
  What was the second question? 
  [Jovel] Do you have knowledge of Salvadorans who have been 
victims of the earthquake? 
  [Cristiani] We have not had any report on this so far. We 
are 
waiting for our Los Angeles, San Francisco consul to report to 
us, probably through the Foreign Ministry. For the time being, 
we do not have any information. 
  [Words indistinct] The new deployment will take place this 
week. I believe today approximately 300 new agents will graduate 
from the Academy. They are always granted a couple of days to 
prepare for the serious issues they will have to face. As the 
saying goes: Dating is a different thing than living with 
someone. [laughter]. The Academy is one thing and once they are 
out on the streets, it is something else. They are given two 
days to strengthen themselves morally and rest up. We expect to 
initiate the new deployment in those two municipalities this 
week. 
  We would like to leave you now with the finance minister. He 
will make a couple of announcements and then he will take your 
questions.

<F P=106> [Report by Mario Jovel from the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, chief of the UN Observers 
for El Salvador [Onusal], has clarified that his mission will 
leave the country at the conclusion of the peace agreement 
verification process and not immediately after the elections, as 
one local newspaper has reported. According to the diplomat, 
the Onusal mandate will continue past the March elections. 
  [Begin Ramirez Ocampo recording] Onusal's obligation is to 
verify the peace agreements, and therefore Onusal's duration is 
determined by compliance with the agreements. [end recording] 
  Ramirez Ocampo said the concern some political sectors have 
over the limited number of party representatives on department 
boards has been resolved by a bill that the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal presented Monday to the Legislative Assembly. 
  According to the Onusal spokesman, the bill states that all 
the parties, including the coalitions, can have a party 
representative in both the department and the municipal boards. 
  [Begin Ramirez Ocampo recording] It is obvious that no party 
can be deprived of representation, but it is also obvious, I 
believe, that there cannot be more than one representative. 
This means that it is important that all contending political 
parties are represented equally at the electoral department 
boards. [end recording] 
  As Ocampo sees it, it must be guaranteed that the electoral 
department and municipal boards function legally.

<F P=106> [Report by Imelda Alvarenga; from the "Facing the Moment" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Catholic Church has reported that at least five 
persons, including two regional FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] leaders, were assassinated death-squad style 
last week. The information was reported by Father Jesus 
Delgado, who issued an appeal during yesterday's homily on 
ending the violence as soon as possible. 
  Meanwhile, Camelia Cartagena, member of the Human Rights 
Commission's directorate board, today endorsed the Catholic 
Church's report, adding that various people who have been 
assassinated and found without their documents were victims of 
paramilitary groups. 
  [Begin recording] [Cartagena] As far as we are concerned, 
all those who are found without their documents, with their 
hands tied, and with signs of torture are victims of the death 
squads. Hence, we agree with the Catholic Church's statements. 
  [Alvarenga] How many reports have you received so far? 
  [Cartagena] I cannot give you figures because I do not have 
the year-end statistics on hand. The ideal thing would be to 
give you that information. However, I can tell you we have a 
large number of cases and the figure coincides with those given 
by the Catholic Church. [end recording] 
  Camelia Cartagena said the Human Rights Commission this week 
will issue a detailed report on human rights violations. 
Moreover, the humanitarian leader urged that the agreements 
concerning the Civilian Police installation and justice 
management have failed to achieve enough progress. 
  Camelia Cartagena reported that members of the much 
criticized Commission for Criminal Affairs and the Antidrug 
Trafficking Unit joined the Civilian Police without a proper 
evaluation.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 18 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Tuesday 
[18 January], the Guatemalan Army denied advising its Mexican 
colleagues in the counter insurgent struggle; although it 
admitted holding routine meetings ever since the peasant 
rebellion began in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas. 
  Guatemalan Defense Minister General Mario Enriquez said 
Mexico does not need "our experience" of more than 30 years 
fighting the Guatemalan guerrillas, and that the meetings held 
have been the usual ones. 
  The dailies PRENSA LIBRE and SIGLO VEINTIUNO, who quote 
sources close to the Army, said high-ranking Mexican military 
officers had been to Guatemala in early January and they had 
travelled to Ixcan, an area of conflict located in the northern 
Quiche Department. 
  "To provide military advice is a political decision. If the 
Mexican authorities request it, I must ask the president for 
authorization," the minister said, pointing out that the 
meetings were not about the Chiapas situation. 
  Gen. Enriquez denied Guatemalan military officers had 
travelled to Mexico to learn about the situation caused by the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) rebellion, although he 
said that way "we would have more reliable information." In 
relation to the surveillance along the area bordering Mexico, he 
reiterated the troops remain in a state of alert because the 
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) "has concentrated 
its forces in that area." 
  The military command in Huehuetenango is coordinating 
surveillance in the border area, which has been divided into 
seven zones, and therefore, "it has not been necessary to send 
reinforcements," according to Army spokesperson Edith Vargas. 
  As of 5 January, the EZLN rebels have been in Guadalupe 
Tepeyac, some 800 meters from the Guatemalan border, north of 
Huehuetenango Department. In this area, Military Zone No. 19 is 
in charge of security and defense but the border is also guarded 
by troops and detachments which depend on the central military 
zones located in the northern Quiche, Alta Verapaz, and Peten 
Departments. 
  According to the Guatemalan defense minister, "the entire 
border is a shield for subversion. We fight them in Ixcan and 
they show up in Mexico," where military intelligence has 
detected hospitals for treating the guerrillas as well as arms 
caches. 
  The daily SIGLO VEINTIUNO quotes a Guatemalan military 
document which says the arrest of a "terrorist criminal" in 
Cacahuatan, Chiapas in July 1984 led to the dismantling of a 
"clandestine surgical hospital." 
  Enriquez ruled out the URNG as having the capacity for 
organizing a rebellion like the EZLN rebellion in Chiapas State 
on 1 January because "it is militarily weak." He also said 
Guatemalan military attaches in Mexico have not reported on the 
alleged Guatemalan guerrillas who were fighting with the 
Zapatists, and he voiced concern about the arrest of Dr. Ruben 
Alejandro Bailey. The medical doctor was arrested on 10 January 
and accused of forming part of the Revolutionary Workers 
Clandestine People's Union Party (PROCUP), which the Mexican 
authorities have accused of terrorist actions.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 17 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Some 100 
Guatemalans participated in a demonstration today in front of 
the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE), demanding the suspension 
of the 30 January referendum which seeks the introduction of 
constitutional reforms. 
  The demonstrators -- who were led by the Mutual Support 
Group 
(GAM), which is striving for the return of 45,000 people who 
have been victims of violent actions -- asked the TSE not to 
validate "the settlement between the Executive and Legislative 
Branches" through the referendum. 
  Late in 1993, the TSE announced a referendum that would 
allow 
3.429 million voters to approve or reject reforms that seek to 
shorten the terms of the Executive and Legislative Branches. 
  According to the multisector social forum that comprises 
various civilian groups, the referendum is only a result of the 
demands and pressure exerted by the IMF and the IDB 
[Inter-American Development Bank], both of which are compelling 
the government to sell various state enterprises. 
  The Labor and Popular Action Union (UASP) issued an appeal 
to 
all groups, urging them "to comprise a united front that rejects 
the settlement that is about to take place." 
  On 16 November the executive and legislative branches agreed 
to introduce the reforms, thereby ending a confrontation which 
began on 27 September -- when President Ramiro de Leon Carpio 
requested the resignation of 116 deputies. 
  GAM leader Nineth Montenegro issued an appeal to the 
Guatemalan people, urging them to abstain from voting on 30 
January because the very act of voting will legitimize a 
settlement between the government and the congressmen. If the 
referendum -- which was proposed by the Executive Branch, 
endorsed by Congress, and announced by the TSE -- is approved by 
a majority, the reforms approved will be enforced 60 days after 
the TSE announces the results. 
  The current Legislative Branch should conclude its term on 
14 
January 1996, but, because of a dispute with the Executive 
Branch stemming from former President Jorge Serrano's 
self-inflicted coup on 25 May, the legislators' removal was 
brought up. Provisional legislators will only remain until 
January 1996, when congressmen elected in the 1995 general 
elections should assume their posts. President de Leon Carpio's 
successor must also be elected on this occasion.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 18 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Willy Zapata, president of the Bank of Guatemala, BANGUAT, 
announced on 10 January that the Monetary Board has authorized 
BANGUAT to obtain loans for up to $260 million from foreign 
credit institutions in 1994. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in 
Spanish 11 Jan 94 p 70) 
  BANGUAT authorities have reported that the annual inflation 
rate as of 31 December 1993 was 11.64 percent, more than two 
points below the 1992 inflation rate of 14.22 percent. The same 
sources noted that the goal established by the Monetary Board 
was met, as inflation was kept below 12.5 percent. (Guatemala 
City SIGLO VEINTIUNO in Spanish 12 Jan 94 p 5) 
  Finance Minister Richard Aitkenhead Castillo confirmed on 14 
January that the World Bank has authorized the second 
disbursement of funds for the Economic Modernization Program it 
signed with Guatemala in 1992. Aitkenhead added that in the 
next few days Guatemala will receive $25 million to be invested 
in social projects. The total credit is for $120 million, of 
which $48 million have already been disbursed. (Guatemala City

<F P=106> [Article by Fasutino Ordonez B.] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina 
guaranteed he will not return from the United States with a lot 
of "hard blows" against the people. Reina said that from now on 
"firm negotiations" will prevail during the meetings he will 
hold with the international financial organization. Reina is 
also scheduled to meet with either President Bill Clinton or 
Vice President Al Gore. 
  Rafael Leonardo Callejas' successor will travel to 
Washington 
tomorrow accompanied by his economic cabinet. This is considered 
a very important step as he will analyze future relations with 
the financial institutions that forced the Nationalist to adopt 
unpopular measures. 
  Reina said: "I am opposed to more blows against the people. 
This situation will be dealt with through firm negotiations, 
presenting solid arguments by prepared advisers. These advisers 
must find just and correct ways to solve the negative figures my 
government will have to face." 
  Reina said he will go on his trip with a different 
mentality, 
believing that the international institutions will understand 
his desire to "give a humanistic image" to the effects of 
Callejas' economic measures. This is why "I hope these meetings 
will be very productive for projects aimed at developing our 
country." he noted. 
  For the president-elect, the meetings he will hold with high 
ranking officials of the U.S. Government are "of significant 
importance and benefit for bilateral relations between Honduras 
and the United States." 
  During the week, the president-elect asked his economic 
cabinet to analyze the state's finances in order to present a 
report to the multilateral organizations. This type of 
information "is fundamental to clarifying all the conditions 
imposed by the international organization and as a support to 
our moral revolutionary project," he explained. 
  With reference to U.S. exerted pressures, Reina said that 
"you cannot demand a friendly government to make sacrifices with 
such high political costs. If they want to help, they will lend 
us their hand. That friendly hand will help our country resolve 
this truly sticky situation." In Reina's opinion "the 
international organizations are not hard, that attitude belongs 
to the cold war era." 
  Upon his arrival, the president-elect will meet with John 
Spero, secretary of negotiations and economic matters of the 
State Department. Early tomorrow Reina will meet with envoy 
Charlene Barchefsky, from the Treasury Department; Carlos Munoz, 
chief of the Central American Division; and Julio Suarez, 
advisor to the executive director. 
  Immediately thereafter, the president-elect will meet with 
Jeffrey Shafer, assistant (international affairs) secretary of 
the Treasury Department, and then he will have lunch with 
Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development 
Bank. In the evening, the Honduran delegation will have dinner 
with senators and congressmen. 
  On Thursday, Reina will breakfast with the members of the 
Council of the Americas and following that he will meet with 
Brian Atwood, under secretary for Management, State Department. 
At noon, Reina will lunch with Kathleen Hennesy, a State 
Department official, and in the afternoon he plans to meet with 
President Bill Clinton or Vice President Al Gore.

  [Text] The Armed Forces are preparing to implement a series 
of changes in the institution's command, not "purges or 
shakeups," Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir 
confirmed yesterday. "If changes are to be made, this is 
definitely a responsibility of the commander in chief which is 
clearly established in the Law Governing the Armed Forces," 
Discua stated. 
  Discua Elvir asserted he will meet this week with commanders 
individually "to define forces' organization," work plans, and 
the changes that will be made. The military chief described as 
errors and speculation the reports on the ratification of all 
military chiefs in the northern part of the country. According 
to the general, there will be few changes and no "shakeups," as 
happened last year. 
  Additionally, the Armed Forces chief said the new national 
defense and public security minister will be named by 
President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina, not by the military 
leadership, as has always occurred in the past. 
  Discua Elvir ruled out a rebellion by officers against him 
in 
view of the announced changes or the situation prevailing within 
the institution. Although he said he does not exercise control 
over everybody, he has his "working team," because a man is 
unable to have more than 10 people under his command. These 10 
men, he stated, "are responsible for disseminating all the 
information an executive can give." 
  Meanwhile, Discua Elvir explained that the election of the 
new congressional president is an internal affair of the Liberal 
Party of Honduras [PLH], but he said he hopes "everything is 
done to benefit" the people and that political party. Discua 
Elvir concluded that the PLH will initiate a strong government, 
"with clear ideas and objectives."

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 18 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  Official sources said Honduran banana production will drop 
by 
5 million cases -- 18 kg each -- in 1994. According to official 
estimates, Honduras will produce 35 million cases in 1994, 
compared to 40 million produced in 1993. The reasons given for 
this were floods at the end of 1993 and EC protectionist 
measures. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1637 GMT 12 Jan) 
  Honduran international reserves dropped approximately $100 
million during the past few months, to the point that there are 
only $131 million in the Central Bank vaults. This is only 
enough foreign exchange to back imports for one month, official 
sources reported on 12 January. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 
1632 GMT 12 Jan 94) 
  Finance Ministry official William Chong reported that the 
government failed to collect 1 billion lempiras in taxes, 
including sales and income taxes. Chong admitted that this is 
due in part to corruption and irregularities in the Customs 
Department. (Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO DE HONDURAS in Spanish 13 
Jan 94 p 3)

  [Excerpt] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada arrived on 
15 January in Laguna de los Patos Airport in the Uruguayan city 
of Colonia. There he was met by the Colonia mayor and then 
talked to the press. 
  [Begin recording] [Sanchez de Lozada] Well now, we hope for 
informal and frank bilateral approaches and approaches with 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. We hope we will be able 
to approach this market that is so important for Bolivia and 
that will become more important in the future. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The Uruguayan press announced during 
the past few hours that Presidents Lacalle, Menem, and Wasmosy 
[of Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay, respectively] reportedly 
have virtually accepted Chile's and Bolivia's entry in the near 
future. 
  [Sanchez de Lozada] Well now, we have some problems because 
we are still part of the Andean market. We do not want to quit 
this pact. Nevertheless, we would like to become a hinge and 
actually be received by this agreement. If there is such a 
political will, it would be something good, but we will wait for 
this to become official. If it becomes official, we will 
consider it with much interest. [passage omitted] [end

  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada believes all 
alternatives must be sought for a sea outlet. He said this when 
he arrived in our country after participating as a guest 
observer in the fifth summit of Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South] countries. 
  As soon as he disembarked from the airplane, President 
Sanchez de Lozada said the remarks he made in Colonia were 
misinterpreted. In Colonia, he pointed out that Bolivia had 
finally discovered its sea outlet through the waterway and that, 
referring to the Pacific Ocean alternative, we had been looking 
in the wrong direction: 
  [Begin recording, in progress] ... in a wrong way. It was an 
ironic, allegorical sentence, saying that, through the waterway, 
we may hint at a sovereign outlet in a multinational way because 
we would be using a Bolivian port through which we would 
directly reach the Atlantic Ocean. 
  Now then, this does not mean, as some people wanted to 
interpret, that we have neglected our Amazon or Pacific destiny. 
We have not neglected our Pacific reality, the necessity of 
linking part of Bolivia, all of Bolivia, with the Pacific ports 
and the Amazon region. That is another sea outlet. [end 
recording] 
  For the president, the outlet to the Atlantic Ocean through 
the waterway is of great economic importance to our country 
because agricultural products, raw materials, and even 
manufactured products may be exported. 
  Concerning Mercosur's acceptance of Bolivia as a guest 
observer, journalists asked the president if this would entail a 
departure from the Andean Pact: 
  [Begin recording] We must talk with the Andean Pact people 
and see if there is a way of approaching Mercosur without losing 
contact with that Pacific bloc. 
  These are things that we must view wisely, but our policy is 
very effectively and very resolutely aimed at becoming a 
Mercosur member. [end recording] 
  The president also mentioned that a tripartite agreement 
among Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia has been reached to 
resolve the Pilcomayo River's environmental problems.

  [Text] ASD [Democratic Socialism Alternative] Deputy Jerjes 
Justiniano has reported the existence of safe houses in Santa 
Cruz where DEA agents torture drug traffickers to obtain 
information. Minister of Government German Quiroga has denied 
this possibility. 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] Hugo San Martin, a national 
government secretary was sent to Santa Cruz. He spent 15, 16, 
and 17 January looking for these alleged safe houses together 
with the local prefect. They found none. They found places 
where the Special Antinarcotics Forces [FELCN] and DEA work, but 
they found no safe houses. [end recording] 
  The minister of government has asked Deputy Justiniano to 
provide the address of these safe houses. 
  [Begin Justiniano recording] Here is the proof. The 
newspaper HOY found a safe house in Santa Cruz. Here is the 
full address; 240 Rene Moreno Street, opposite Blacutt Square. 
The house belongs to Mrs. Pura Bowles de Fernandez. This was 
verified by national and Santa Cruz press sources. Journalists 
visited this house and confirmed this. What other evidence do 
you want? I am not a policeman. It is the duty of the Interior 
Ministry to make pertinent investigations. If they do not know 
about this, they are either accomplices or foolish. [end 
recording] 
  Minister Quiroga nonetheless insists that safe houses do not 
exist because even U.S. Ambassador Bowers has assured him of 
this. 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] I have spoken with the U.S. 
Ambassador to express the Bolivian Government's concern over 
this subject and he has assured me that such charges are not 
true. Neither the DEA nor the U.S. Embassy acknowledge the 
existence of this kind of safe houses in the country. [end 
recording] 
  The minister of government reported that he asked Deputy 
Justiniano to join the delegation that went to investigate the 
existence of these safe houses but that he did not want to 
accompany the group.

<F P=106> [Report by Fidelina Suarez] </F>
  [Text] The announcement that the government has given 
priority this year to production and that resources to promote 
it total approximately $400 million has caused a positive 
reaction from the private sector, which met yesterday with Pablo 
Pereira, economy and development minister. 
  Ramiro Gurdian, Cosep [Council of Higher Enterprise] 
president, made the statements at the end of a meeting during 
which Economy and Development Ministry officials explained to 
representatives of the private sector the production program for 
this year, which should actually correspond to the available 
resources and human capability. 
  The economy minister reiterated: "We are trying to create 
appropriate financial and production programs. We are also 
reviewing the possibilities to obtain resources so as not to 
create expectations when resources are limited." 
  During the year, the government plans are aimed at promoting 
areas the private sector identifies as potential production 
areas, such as shrimp hatching and fisheries, as well as 
products of nontraditional crops. 
  Pereira explained that the financial resources will come 
from 
the very payments made by debtors to the financial system, 
savings deposited in banks, and foreign resources obtained from 
the Central American Integration Bank (BCIE), the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB), and other external sources. 
  Meanwhile, the Cosep president said the organization 
prepared, together with Economy and Development Ministry 
authorities, an agenda that will be reviewed weekly to discuss 
what he called "bottlenecks" that may appear in the production 
area. 
  "The reality is that we must all work this year without 
thinking about goals; if the growth expected by the government 
is achieved, then welcome it," he added. 
  Gurdian stated that Cosep has asked the government about the 
need to revise the value of the cordoba, energy and diesel 
costs, and production costs in general. 
  Meanwhile, Industries Chamber President Alberto Chamorro 
highlighted the determination with which the government is 
tackling the microaspects of the economy, such as production. 
  Chamorro predicted a boom in the fishing and food and 
beverages sectors.

<F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Christian Democratic Party [PDC] President Raul Ossa 
accused Ruben Dario Carles, former comptroller general and 
current presidential candidate, of surreptitiously paying off 
the IFIS [International Financial Institutions] while forfeiting 
the country's health, education, and economic stability. 
  [Begin recording] Our position has been quite clear. It is a 
fact that Mr. Carles chose to pay off the IFIS, even to the 
point of breaking the law. I have the letter he signed whereby 
he surreptitiously paid off the IFIS behind the back of the 
National Assembly Budget Commission. In doing this, he denied 
equipment to schools, the 13th month bonus to public workers, 
and medication to hospitals. He did all this while at the same 
time he paid off the IFIS. 
  In this respect, we believe this is not the type of policy 
which will be healthy for Panama. We believe Panama must honor 
its commitments to the IFIS. At the same time, however, we must 
honor the country's social debt, create more employment, provide 
more equipment for schools, more education for the people, 
medication to hospitals, and raise the retirement age. Carles 
does not intend to do any of this. He represents the denial of 
all of this.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with General Martin Balza, the Army </F>
chief of staff, by Laura Luz Ojeda in Mar del Plata "before 
leaving for Croatia"] 
  [Text] [Ojeda] What is the Army's current situation? 
  [Balza] It is a motivated Army that has much faith in the 
future, but is dynamically working in the present and complying 
with this year's projections. For example, now we are 
conducting courses in the training and advanced studies 
institutes, preparing the groups that will replace our men in 
Croatia, Cyprus, and Kuwait. I believe that I view the Army the 
way in which the society to which we belong and serve views it. 
  [Ojeda] What is the Army's relationship with the current 
government? 
  [Balza] It is the proper relationship for an armed force 
with the authorities it must serve. It is a relationship of 
total subordination, within a framework of respect and much 
understanding. 
  [Ojeda] Do you agree with the budget allocated to you? 
  [Balza] This is a confidential issue that I discuss 
exclusively with the defense minister. I may actually say that 
we already are working under the 1994 budget and that there has 
been an increase that allows us to view the tasks scheduled for 
this year with much optimism. 
  [Ojeda] Are you not viewing a progressive shrinking in 
recent times as far as Army personnel are concerned? 
  [Balza] I am absolutely not viewing a shrinking Army. Quite 
the contrary, I view an Army in which quality prevails over 
quantity and training prevails over weakness. It is a trained 
and motivated Army, with great experience, an Army in which our 
men, who are carrying out peace missions, are being greatly 
enriched both technically and culturally. 
  [Ojeda] What is your armament level? 
  [Balza] We have enough weapons to train ourselves. More 
detailed points on this issue are already confidential. 
  [Ojeda] What is your opinion of the fact that Argentine 
forces will have to remove the mines in the Malvinas Islands? 
  [Balza] The information I have is that supplied by the 
media. We have not received any orders in this regard and the 
defense minister was very clear on this point. 
  [Ojeda] Will military service remain compulsory? 
  [Balza] This is a political decision. It is society, 
through its legislators, that will determine this. Neither the 
Armed Forces nor the Army will determine this. If a volunteer 
system is implemented, many things would have to be changed, but 
thus far our legislators have not contemplated the possibility 
of abolishing the conscription system. 
  [Ojeda] In your opinion, should it or shouldn't it be 
compulsory? 
  [Balza] All NATO countries, with the exception of the United 
Kingdom and some other principalities, have compulsory military 
service. The same applies for the former Warsaw Pact countries 
and American countries, with the exception of the United States, 
Canada, and Uruguay. Therefore, this system has been chosen 
almost everywhere in the world. 
  [Ojeda] What is your opinion of Scotland Yard and the 
investigation it has conducted in our country? 
  [Balza] This issue is not linked to the Army. If the 
British authorities believe that any of their soldiers violated 
the Geneva Convention, they must conduct the investigations they 
deem appropriate, but this issue does not involve us. 
  [Ojeda] When will the replacement be implemented in Croatia? 
  [Balza] In late February. I will leave on 19 January to 
visit the troops there, the new positions, and the two seriously 
wounded men we have there in order to decorate them in the name 
of the Army. Afterward, I plan on briefly visiting the men who 
are building roads in Kuwait. I would like to emphasize that 
all of us Argentines should feel proud of the conduct of our 
men-at-arms who are carrying out missions abroad in UN 
organizations, helping world peace.

  [Text] Caracas, 18 Jan (AFP) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister 
Fernando Ochoa Antich announced in Caracas that the signing of 
the trade agreement of the Group of Three (G-3, Mexico, 
Colombia, and Venezuela), which was scheduled for tomorrow at a 
presidential meeting, was postponed until February. 
  Ochoa Antich told the media that the meeting, which was to 
be 
held in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), was postponed at the 
request of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in view 
of the difficult situation Mexico is experiencing due to the 
uprising in Chiapas. 
  The foreign minister indicated that given that in the next 
few days there will be a number of important regional 
commitments, such as the inauguration of the new president of 
Ecuador [as received], the signing was postponed for after 2 
February, when Venezuelan President-elect Rafael Caldera takes 
office. Ochoa Antich also said the presidents are studying the 
possibility of holding their meeting in another city. 
  The G-3 trade treaty is a tripartite agreement for the 
expansion of the trade flow among Colombia, Mexico, and 
Venezuela. It provides for the complete elimination of tariffs 
within 10 years. The agreement that will be signed by the 
presidents establishes regulations for access to markets, 
regulations on origin of products, technical norms, intellectual 
property regulations, and regulations for the exchange of 
transportation, telecommunications, financial, and professional 
services. It is expected that this agreement, which at the 
moment of its signing contemplates an asymmetrical lifting of 
tariffs giving 28 percent preference to Mexico and 12 percent to 
Colombia and Venezuela, will go into effect in July, after it is 
approved by the countries' parliaments. 
  Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela form a market of 145 million 
people, with $50 billion in total exports and $60 billion in 
imports. The GDP of the three countries is approximately $373 
billion.

<F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has said he 
hopes that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American 
Affairs Alexander Watson, who is arriving on an official visit 
to Lima, will objectively evaluate the progress made by Peru, 
especially in the struggle against subversion. 
  [Begin recording] [Fujimori] I hope that Mr. Watson -- who 
knows Peru because he was ambassador here during a very 
difficult period, during the previous administration -- will 
objectively evaluate the situation, the progress that has been 
made in the antiterrorist struggle, and the respect there is for 
human rights, with the exception of isolated cases that might 
have taken place. I sincerely hope that the assistance that has 
previously been promised by the United States will be released. 
  [Reporter] There are reports that the talks on the Lima 
Convention between the Peruvian and Chilean negotiators have 
been suspended. What can you tell us about this? 
  [Fujimori] These negotiations are alternatively taking place 
in Santiago and Lima. I hope they continue. I think that some 
progress has been made. Some details have yet to be worked out. 
  [Reporter] Are there some discrepancies yet, Mr. President? 
  [Fujimori] Some points I consider details still remain. We 
hope that the interests of both sides can be fully served. 
  [Reporter] In your speech at the Plaza de Armas on the 
anniversary of the city, you said that the [word indistinct] of 
Decree 776 divides the country and that it is necessary, in 
order not to deprive the municipalities of authority, to repair 
that damage. Is this going to be considered? 
  [Fujimori] Municipal autonomy has not been lessened at all. 
What happens is that the tax reform has objectives. We have 
always said, I believe with the support of the country, that the 
General Sales Tax must be the most important tax. This is a 
strictly technical opinion. It has nothing to do with some 
interpretations of this. I have been surprised to find that 
some provincial mayors have complained about this when the fact 
is that they will be able to double or triple their revenues 
because of the Municipal Compensation Fund. [end recording]

  [Text] Tomorrow, the criminal court of the Supreme Court

Villanueva who is in favor of La Cantuta case being tried in a 
common court. Meanwhile, Judge Carlo Magno Chacon Flores 
continues hearing testimony from relatives of the missing 
persons. 
  At 1100 an appeal was filed with the high court on the 
jurisdication of the common court together with the opinion of 
Victor Cubas Villanueva who has participated in the 
investigations carried out up until now. In this document, 
Cubas Villanueva reiterates his position with regard to Chacon 
Flores. Again, he has requested the designation of an ad hoc 
judge for this case. 
  [Being recording] [Unidentified reporter] How long will it 
take to receive a reply to your official request? 
  [Cubas Villanueva] This does not depend on my office any 
longer. I am certain a response will be received in a few days, 
because the case is ready to be presented to the criminal court. 
Once a decision has been issued by the higher prosecutor, the 
magistrates of the criminal court of the Supreme Court will 
issue their ruling. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Chacon Flores confirmed that the prosecutor's 
opinion, his own opinion, and the appeal on the competence of 
the court will be remitted tomorrow to the Supreme Court. The 
Supreme Court must then decide where the La Cantuta case will 
finally be tried.

and a group of entrepreneurs. It will be headed by Economy and 
Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas. 
  An official source told us that there is an important trade 
link based on compensation agreements between Iran and Uruguay. 
  The source said that the products to be negotiated are those 
that traditionally have been exchanged between the two 
countries. The source stressed, however, that "there might be 
significant news for the textile industry, which is particularly 
important at difficult times like the present."

  [Text] A military source told EL OBSERVADOR that General 
Raul Mermot has been sanctioned with 10 days of strict arrest by 
the Army commander in chief, but he will continue as commander 
of the Third Army Division based in Tacuarembo because the 
sanction is to be applied "without hindering his present 
function." 
  The sources minimized the importance of the sanction that 
will end on 17 January. A military source said Mermot "has the 
command channels open" and he, therefore, continues "commanding 
the division." 
  The source said Mermot is a member of the Supreme Tribunal 
on 
Promotions and Resources, adding that for the past 30 days he 
has been working at Army Command headquarters, where he 
currently is serving his strict arrest. 
  "The sanction of strict arrest is continuous for a period. 
Then we have, according to the characteristics of the violation, 
suspensions, reassignments, reassignment suspensions, and trial 
by military justice," the source said. 
  Lieutenant General Daniel Garcia, Army commander in chief, 
said Gen. Mermot's sanction is an Army "internal and 
administrative issue." A military source added: "The fact that 
a general has been sanctioned does not mean it did not happen 
before or that it will not happen again."

January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  On 4 January, the Central Bank reported that the state 
registered a 357.2 million-peso deficit in the January-October 
1993 period. This was the result of the public sector's 
nonfinancial surplus of 73.8 million pesos and a 431 
million-peso deficit in the "parafiscal" sector. (Montevideo LA 
MANANA in Spanish 5 Jan 94 p 43) 
  The Central Bank's net international reserves increased 
$213.3 million in 1993; total reserves now amount to $1.1603 
billion, 22.5 percent more than in 1992. (Montevideo EL

  [Text] President Ramon Velasquez opened the meeting of 
mayors this morning, and state decentralization will be the main 
topic of discussion. For the first time an administrative 
mechanism has been created that allows cooperation and 
coordination between central and regional governments. The 
value-added tax [VAT] and its application also became a leading 
topic of discussion at the meeting. 
  [Begin recording] [Caracas Mayor Aristobulo Isturiz] We 
demand what the Constitution stipulates. The Constitution says 
that all taxes must have a common characteristic; that is, they 
must be progressive and fair. In other words, people who earn 
more should pay more taxes; those who earn less should pay less; 
and those who have nothing should pay nothing. That is fair. 
The VAT taxes everyone equally. People who earn more pay the 
same as those who earn nothing. This policy has critical 
consequences because the Venezuelan Constitution still stresses 
the role of the state by noting that the state has 
responsibilities toward the citizens and that the citizens have 
basic rights. 
  [Maracaibo Mayor Fernando Chumaceiro] The process of 
administrative decentralization, which basically had been a 
transfer of power from the central government to the state 
governments, has been expanded. This is positive progress, but 
it is insufficient. Full decentralization takes place once 
decentralization reaches municipal levels, and then from 
municipal levels to parochial levels. [end recording]

  [Text] Barcelona -- Amid violent protests against the 
increase in bus fares, groups of neighborhood residents and 
students burned tires on the main roads to Puerto La Cruz and 
Barcelona and to other zones of that city and set fire to a bus 
and a fuel truck. Policemen shot a woman and made numerous 
arrests. There was almost total absenteeism at places of 
employment due to a sudden work stoppage decreed by the 
Transportation Union in Anzoategui State. 
  Neighborhood groups and student organizations of Eastern 
University (UDO), Puerto La Cruz branch, demanded that the 
Transportation Union and local municipalities reach an agreement 
on fares because an increase decreed in both cities exceeded the 
30-percent mark, thus affecting the entire labor sector. 
  The increase was approved by Barcelona Municipality in 
December but was revoked until three days ago in response to 
neighborhood committee protests. 
  The neighborhood organizations' action resulted in the 
closure of principal roads, particularly an alternate road, all 
of which were obstructed by burning tires. The Metropolitan 
Police (PM) cleared the roads after 0900, while criminals who 
had infiltrated the demonstration tried to set fire to the 
Araguay gas station near the Santo Domingo housing area. 
  Public transportation was suspended and thousands of workers 
were left stranded. 
  The PM reported the arrest of eight persons, including 
students and neighborhood residents, who were traveling in a 
black pickup, license plates 383-BAR, loaded with used tires 
that the individuals intended to burn on various roads leading 
to public transportation routes. 
  Bolivar and Sotillo Municipalities (Barcelona and Puerto La 
Cruz) decided to repeal the fare increase unilaterally approved 
by the Transportation Union in December. 
  One woman was shot during the protests, and demonstrators 
set 
fire to a bus and a fuel truck while dozens of people were 
arrested amid veritable traffic chaos. 
  The alternate route was most heavily affected by the 
protest, 
which included the participation of residents from more than 50 
heavily populated neighborhoods along the route. Local 
residents began setting up barricades and burning tires to 
obstruct traffic in the early morning hours. Mrs. Rosa Blanco, 
46 years old, was shot in Santo Domingo neighborhood when the PM 
arrived and indiscriminately began to set off a large number of 
tear gas bombs. Apparently a PM agent fired his regulation 
weapon and the bullet wounded the woman in the back. She was 
transferred to Las Garzas hospital where she underwent surgery. 
  On the intercommunity highway, a group of demonstrators that 
included UDO students burned a tourism bus valued at several 
million bolivares that belonged to the Responsible Venezuela 
line. The demonstrators also torched a fuel truck owned by the 
SAET [expansion unknown] transportation company, license plate 
754-AAR, as it was being driven in an area close to the UDO. 
  To the south, residents of La Ponderosa and El Vinedo 
obstructed the highway to the coast and blocked traffic en route 
to the capital. By noon dozens of trucks and hundreds of 
privately owned vehicles were waiting for the highway to be 
opened. Cruz Bastardo and Arquimedes Barrios, leaders of the 
Neighborhood Federation, said the protests will continue until 
the Transportation Union discusses a more equitable fare system. 
  The National Guard intervened at about 1100 after the bus 
was 
burned, and fierce clashes occurred between the military and the 
demonstrators, who had sought shelter at the UDO.

<F P=106> [Report by Patricia Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Venezuela has rejected the recommendations stated in 
the OAS Inter-American Human Rights Commission [CIDH] report on 
the El Amparo case and asked that organization to convene a 
meeting to ask them to reconsider the document they drafted on 
the killing of fishermen in October 1988, according to reliable 
sources. 
  This is how the Venezuelan State responded to the CIDH on 11 
January. The government's stand calls for the report to be 
reconsidered and a meeting to be held. This last request was 
granted for 31 January or 1 February. Guido Grooscors, 
Venezuelan ambassador to the OAS, will be part of the delegation 
that will defend the country at that meeting. 
  It was learned that the Venezuelan Government has informed 
the CIDH that the Military Court has decided to reopen the case, 
in which the defunct commando Jose Antonio Paez, the Judicial 
Technical Police, and Disip [Directorate of intelligence and 
Prevention Services] were accused of having massacred 14 
fishermen whom they mistook for guerrillas of Colombia's Army of 
National Liberation in La Colorada creek, La Guasfita, Apure 
State. 
  The CIDH recommended that the Venezuelan Government impose 
sanctions against those who masterminded and covered up the 
killing, offer a just compensation to the direct relatives of 
victims, and adopt internal legal provisions. This, the 
commission added, should be done to revise and modify the 
Military Code of Justice. 
  As the report established, Venezuela had to pronounce itself 
on the recommendations contained in the document before 15 
January 1994, when the term would expire for hearing the 
measures the government would adopt at the commission's request. 
  The government rejected the recommendations, however. 
Regarding the possibility that the El Amparo case be brought 
before the court, the same has not been ruled out. We will have 
to wait until the parties--commission and Venezuela--decide what 
to do after the meeting. 
  Meanwhile, the CIDH could draft a second report, giving a 
definitive character and a new term to the recommendations. If 
Venezuela fails to fulfill the same, it will publish the 
document internationally.

Patricia Spadaro] 
  [Text] Over the past four months the governments of 
Venezuela and Colombia have exchanged diplomatic notes, setting 
out their respective positions on the demarcation of maritime 
and underwater boundaries in the Gulf of Venezuela. 
  The texts of the notes, which are in the hands of EL DIARIO 
DE CARACAS, had been held in great secrecy due to the high level 
of sensitivity of the subject in both countries. 
  The first note was sent by the Colombian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs on 15 September 1993 and was answered by the Venezuelan 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs two months later on 15 November 1993. 
  The note from Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin was 
sent 
in connection with the visit which Venezuelan Foreign Minister 
Fernando Ochoa Antich made to Bogota in August 1993, during 
which he made a statement on the dispute. 
  In her note Colombian Foreign Minister Sanin pointed out 
that 
her Venezuelan counterpart had expressed "views which my 
government does not share." 
  The Colombian foreign minister recalled that, "The official 
position of Colombia is that, unless something else is provided 
in a treaty duly ratified by the two parties or in a decision by 
an arbitrator or by a court, the demarcation of the border 
between our respective territorial seas, continental shelves, 
and Exclusive Economic Zones should be accomplished in the 
following way: 
  "A. Starting from the point where the land border between 
the 
two countries reaches the sea at the place called `Los 
Castilletes,' an equidistant line should be drawn between the 
points farthest out from the adjacent coasts of the two 
countries to a point equidistant from the coasts facing each 
other. 
  "B. From the previously mentioned point the border will 
continue along a median line drawn between the points farthest 
out from the adjacent coasts of the two countries. The small 
islands known as `Los Monjes' [The Monks] will not be used for 
drawing baselines in the determination of the border." 
  It was learned that Colombian Foreign Minister Sanin did not 
discuss the map with the Colombian negotiators who, for the past 
three years, have been carrying on conversations with their 
Venezuelan counterparts, on the basis of the modus operandi set 
forth in the Agreement of San Pedro Alejandrino, approved by the 
two parties on 6 May 1990. 
  For his part Venezuelan Foreign Minister Ochoa complained to 
his Colombian counterpart about using this channel to engage in 
polemics regarding this dispute, when a mechanism has been 
specifically agreed upon by both countries for handling this 
subject. 
  Ochoa pointed out that I am "surprised that your [Sanin's] 
government has handled this matter by means of a diplomatic 
note, when the Agreement of San Pedro Alejandrino is still in 
force between our two countries...I consider that, since a 
Binational Presidential Negotiating Commission exists, made up 
of representatives appointed by both governments, to determine 
an equitable border line, in accordance with the norms and 
principles of international law, there is no justification for 
creating a dispute about the matter. Nevertheless, you must 
understand that it is impossible to remain silent in view of the 
statements made in your note. In this respect I must say the 
following: 
  "A. Venezuela has and always has had, in complete conformity 
with the law, full sovereignty and possession over its land and 
maritime territory in the Gulf of Venezuela. 
  "B. Venezuela has and always has had, in complete conformity 
with the law, full sovereignty and possession over the 
Archipelago of Los Monjes. These islands have created a 
territorial sea, a contiguous zone, a continental shelf, and an 
Exclusive Economic Zone, as well as any other zone which could 
be established. Consequently, these rights must be respected and 
applied in the demarcation of our maritime and underwater 
boundaries, as has been recognized by the Republic of Colombia 
during the whole process of negotiations. 
  "C. In your referenced note we have observed with surprise 
the introduction of new elements in the description of the 
Colombian position which have never been presented by the 
delegation of your country to the Binational Negotiating 
Commission in the course of the discussions now under way. 
Therefore, I reserve the position of the Government of 
Venezuela." 
  Ochoa stated in his note that, "Venezuela repeats once again 
that the allegations contained in your note and described as the 
'official position of Colombia' are contrary both to the facts 
as well as to the law and have been refuted by our government in 
numerous notes whose terms need not be repeated here but in 
which our position has been expressed in a clear and unequivocal 
way." 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister also alluded to his 
appearance before the Colombian communications media. In this 
respect he pointed out: "My statements in answer to questions 
asked by the Colombian press during my official visit to Bogota 
were in the framework of the Venezuelan position." 
  In both notes the ministers of foreign affairs emphasized 
the 
feelings of friendship and cooperation between the two 
countries, while at the same time they repeated the intentions 
of the two countries to reach a peaceful and friendly solution 
to the dispute. 
  At the request of Andres Pastrana, one of the candidates for 
the presidency of the Conservative Party of Colombia, the 
negotiators of both countries agreed to request that the subject 
of the boundaries in the Gulf of Venezuela be excluded from 
discussion in the elections campaign until February 1994, when 
the next president of Venezuela will assume office. 
  The proposal was welcomed by Presidents Cesar Gaviria of 
Colombia and Ramon J. Velasquez of Venezuela and accepted by 
candidates for the presidency in the two countries. 
  During his recent visit to Caracas Pastrana congratulated 
Venezuelan political figures for having kept their promise to 
keep silent on the subject. He considered that the same thing 
should continue to be done in Colombia. Pastrana has proposed 
extending the agreement until the end of the elections campaign 
in Colombia, a matter which is still under consideration.

<F P=106> [Editorial entitled: "The Colombian Note"] </F>
  [Text] We should not be surprised at the diplomatic note 
sent by the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Casa 
Amarilla [seat of the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs], 
in which Colombia confirms that it has returned to its most 
extreme position regarding the demarcation of the maritime and 
underwater borders between the two countries in the Gulf of 
Venezuela. 
  The Colombian note, in which Colombia reminds us that it has 
available to it means for a solution to the controversy other 
than direct negotiations and which denies legitimate, Venezuelan 
rights to the Los Monjes Archipelago, confirms everything that 
we have warned people about in terms of Colombian behavior and 
which was referred to some two years ago in the "Informe 
Bacalao" [Bacalao Report], presented by Isabel Carlota Bacalao 
Romer, an international lawyer, to the Venezuelan Negotiating 
Commission before she submitted her resignation as an adviser to 
the commission. 
  The note which Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin sent 
to 
Fernando Ochoa Antich, our foreign minister, should be rejected 
by Venezuela and by all Venezuelans because: 
  In the first place, Venezuela cannot accept, as the 
Colombian 
note suggests, arbitration or the International Court of Justice 
as channels for reaching a peaceful solution of the dispute; and 
in the second place, the Los Monjes Islands certainly generate 
rights to a territorial sea, a contiguous zone, a continental 
shelf, and an Exclusive Economic Zone, just as Colombia demanded 
in its border demarcation dispute with Nicaragua over 
Quintanilla, Roncador, and Quita Sueno Islands, which make up 
the San Andres Archipelago. 
  We must refuse to allow Colombia to return to that extreme 
position when direct negotiations--according to the many 
statements which have been made--are going well. At the same 
time we must refuse to allow Colombia to place itself in open 
contradiction to the position which it took in its territorial 
dispute with Nicaragua. 
  Nevertheless, we say that the Colombian position should not 
surprise us, because it reveals a stark reality: that Colombia 
has always wanted to go to arbitration and to the International 
Court of Justice and that it certainly has those possibilities 
open to it, thanks to the Declaration of Caracas, the 
Declaration of Urena, and the Agreement of San Pedro 
Alejandrino, documents which were signed by [former] Venezuelan 
President Carlos Andres Perez. These three documents, as Bacalao 
stated in her report, were part of a premeditated scenario to 
have this dispute resolved by third parties. In this way 
President Perez made the Treaty of 1939 applicable and even 
appointed the members of the arbitration commission. 
  Regarding the fact that Colombia has decided to return to 
its 
most extreme position, this should not be surprising, either. 
  For many years Colombia has presented, on the one hand, the 
appearance of good faith to the world regarding the demarcation 
of the maritime and underwater boundaries in the Gulf of 
Venezuela. On the other hand, Colombia has applied pressure on 
our country with everything it has available to it: matters 
related to the narcotics traffic, guerrilla activity, illegal 
immigration, and the theft of vehicles, to mention only some of 
the problems which it has raised. 
  How long will this go on, Colombia? Venezuela wants 
fraternal 
relations and integration with Colombia. Successive Venezuelan 
Governments have made every effort and gone even further to 
achieve that dream. Meanwhile, successive Colombian Governments 
persist in ignoring what is of vital interest to us: our 
unquestionable sovereignty in the waters of the Gulf of 
Venezuela.

  [Text] Senator Pompeyo Marquez, member of the Presidential 
Negotiating Commission on maritime and underwater boundaries and 
other matters with Colombia, was annoyed by the contents of the 
diplomatic note which Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin 
sent to Venezuelan Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich. He 
said that for the past four years "none of the assumptions and 
discussions which have taken place ever contemplated what Sanin 
has stated." 
  In the diplomatic note Sanin emphasized that the demarcation 
of the territorial sea should be undertaken in the following 
way: "Starting from the point where the land border between the 
two countries reaches the sea at the place called `Los 
Castilletes,' an equidistant line should be drawn between the 
points farthest out from the adjacent coasts of the two 
countries, and a point equidistant from the coasts facing each 
other." Furthermore, she denied that the Los Monjes Archipelago 
creates any kind of rights in the demarcation of the border. 
  Senator Marquez emphasized that, "There is no agreement on 
this matter." At the same time he referred to the memorandum 
which the Binational Commission will send to Presidents Ramon J. 
Velasquez [of Venezuela] and Cesar Gaviria [of Colombia] and to 
President Elect Rafael Caldera, certifying "that there was no 
agreement on this matter." 
  The senator stated that "this position of Foreign Minister 
Sanin has nothing to do with the facts of the negotiations 
because, as stated in the note in reply to her from Venezuelan 
Foreign Minister Ochoa, and which completely reflects Venezuelan 
feelings, "that view was never expressed in the negotiations." 
  The Sanin note on the dispute, which expresses the "official 
position of Colombia," was a "document kept secret" even from 
Alberto Casas Santamaria, Colombian ambassador to Venezuela. He 
admitted that, "He had no knowledge of the text of the note." 
  Ambassador Casas stated: "I have to congratulate those who 
prepared that news report, because they really got a story which 
I believe is worthy of an international prize. They succeeded in 
publishing a secret document of which I have no knowledge." 
  Casas said that he has no knowledge of the contents of the 
note in question because it was sent before his appointment as 
ambassador to Venezuela. 
  Vice Admiral Radames Munoz Leon, Venezuelan minister of 
national defense, preferred to decline comment on the exchange 
of notes between Sanin and Ochoa. He said, "That is a matter for 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, not for me." He added that he 
hoped that the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs would 
continue to support the policies which President Ramon J. 
Velasquez approved on that matter. 
  Isabel Carlota de Bacalao, the former adviser to the 
Venezuelan Negotiating Commission, called the note sent by 
Colombian Foreign Minister Sanin a particularly uncompromising 
repetition "of maximum Colombian positions on the subject of 
border demarcation and a clear statement of the position of her 
country." 
  She stated that Colombia has stated once again that, in 
addition to the Agreement of San Pedro Alejandrino, there are 
other means for settling the negotiations, such as the Treaty of 
1939, which covers the intervention of third parties, a position 
which Venezuela has always rejected. 
  She added that, "In its reply Colombia has rejected the view 
that `Los Monjes' are islands and does not mention at any time 
the name of the Gulf of Venezuela." By contrast Bacalao called 
the reply of the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "very 
weak," since, "although it points out that the Los Monjes 
Archipelago creates a territorial sea, a contiguous zone, a 
continental shelf, and an Exclusive Economic Zone, it did not 
occur to the ministry that Colombia, in its border dispute with 
Nicaragua, claimed the island benefits generated by Roncador, 
Quita Sueno, and Quintanilla Islands." 
  She considered that "this inconsistency of Colombia is a 
weapon in the hands of Venezuela. It would seem that to prevent 
relations between the two countries from deteriorating further, 
the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not emphasizing 
this point, which supports the Venezuelan position." 
  She said that Sanin set down the exact dimensions of the 
battlefield in which she hopes the negotiations will take place. 
Venezuela is trying "to slip away weakly" from the realities of 
the Colombian note. 
  Bacalao emphasized that the note sent by Colombia is "an 
impeccable reaffirmation of the Colombian position, presented by 
a country which has very clearly in mind the dividing line 
between the state and the government, and which has never 
confused the interests of the state with personal interests." 
  She continued: "In Venezuela these are confused. Our country 
does not distinguish between state and government and has no 
clear awareness of the legal and political consequences 
generated by every word, every error, every omission, and every 
action not properly performed." 
  Bacalao concluded by pointing out that, while the Colombian 
note is forceful, the Venezuelan note is inadequate.

  [Text] During the past four months relations between 
Colombia and Venezuela have been marked by developments and 
statements which, taken one by one, have led the respective 
governments to set out their official positions, with the tone 
of the language rising at times. During this period bilateral 
relations have reflected a novel feature. What was previously 
resolved directly is now handled through the formality of 
diplomatic notes, which takes flexibility out of relations and 
creates an atmosphere of tension, even when government officials 
have stated that relations are good. 

  -  9 June: Andres Pastrana, a candidate for president of 
Colombia, proposed that his country and Venezuela approve an 
"agreed pause" in polemics until after the elections in both 
countries, later resuming negotiations on the border dispute in 
the Gulf of Venezuela. 
  -  8 July: Ramon Escovar Salom, the attorney 
general of Venezuela, asked for the cancellation of Decree 1911, 
signed by [former] President Carlos Andres Perez, which 
authorizes the registration of the birth of children of 
undocumented persons in Venezuela. 
  -  30 August: Foreign Minister 
Fernando Ochoa Antich began an official visit to Bogota, during 
which he stated that "the demarcation of maritime and underwater 
areas touches the most sensitive fibers of Venezuelan 
nationalist feeling. If the Colombian people do not understand 
that, the process of integration between the two countries will 
be harmed." 
  Asked about the complaint made by a Colombian Catholic 
organization, according to which Venezuela is violating the 
human rights of undocumented residents of Venezuela, Ochoa 
pointed out that "illegal immigrants are those who violate 
Venezuelan laws."%1 September: At a joint press conference held 
at the end of Venezuelan Foreign Minister Ochoa's visit to 
Bogota, the Colombian and Venezuelan ministers of foreign 
affairs maintained their "contrasting points of view" regarding 
their differing views on the boundaries in the Gulf of 
Venezuela.%1 September: Colombia deported 10 Venezuelan citizens 
who were living illegally in Colombia. According to the DAS 
[Colombian Administrative Department of Security], the 
Venezuelans were involved in promoting and selling American 
[sic; as printed] products in Colombia.%15 September: The 
Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a diplomatic note to 
Caracas in which it repeated the Colombian position on the 
demarcation of maritime and underwater boundaries in the Gulf of 
Venezuela, in reply to statements made by Venezuelan Foreign 
Minister Ochoa at the joint press conference held in Bogota on 1 
September. The text of the note leaked out in Caracas on 17 
December, three months after it was sent. 
  On 15 September Colombia sent another note of protest, 
complaining about the violation of the human rights of Colombian 
citizens resident in Venezuela by the National Guard.%8 October: 
Alberto Casas Santamaria presented his credentials at Miraflores 
Palace as the new ambassador of Colombia in Caracas.%15 
November: Venezuela sent two notes of protest to Colombia. One 
of the notes rejected Colombian accusations about violations of 
human rights in Venezuela, and the other note referred to the 
holding of the "Primer Encuentro de Colombianos en Venezuela" 
[First Meeting of Colombians in Venezuela], which took place in 
Caracas between 9 and 12 October and at which the Venezuelan 
authorities were accused of violating human rights. These 
conclusions were presented for the consideration of the 
Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The contents of the 
document caused annoyance to the Venezuelan authorities. In his 
note Venezuelan Foreign Minister Ochoa termed the conclusions of 
the above-mentioned meeting unacceptable and criticized the fact 
that such a meeting was used "to perform political acts, in 
violation of the express provisions of existing legislation 
regarding foreign nationals."%20 November: Antonio Navarro 
Wolff, the Colombian presidential candidate of the "Alianza 
Democratica M-19" [Democratic Alliance/19 April Movement], 
stated that the Venezuelan National Guard was taking bribes from 
undocumented Colombians to nationalize them as Venezuelan 
citizens.%20 November: General Pedro Romero Farias, the 
commander of the Venezuelan National Guard, called Navarro Wolff 
a criminal and warned that if he entered Venezuela, he would be 
arrested and tried.%20 November: Venezuelan Foreign Minister 
Ochoa stated in reply to Navarro Wolff, "These are surprising 
and aggressive statements which I cannot understand and which 
Venezuela cannot accept."%20 November: Radames Munoz Leon,

  [Text] Rene Prosper, minister of the interior of the 
Haitian Government, denies the information alleging that there 
was shooting at the residence of Finance Minister Mrs. 
Marie-Michele Rey in Petion-Ville during the night of 13 to 14 
January. According to Mr. Prosper, gunshots were actually only 
heard in the vicinity of Mrs. Rey's residence. He immediately 
gave instructions for police patrols to go to the scene. He 
explains that this was done promptly by units from the 
Port-au-Prince police and the Petion-Ville Military District, 
which reinforced the protection of the concerned residence. 
Rene Prosper communicated these explanations to the HAITI PRESS 
AGENCY over the phone from Miami, where he was participating in 
the international conference on the Haitian crisis.

  [Text] Following the conference in Miami, one more voice 
is being raised in favor of the national conference in Haiti. 
  Former Prime Minister Marc Bazin has chosen the U.S. 
newspaper THE MIAMI HERALD to voice his support for holding such 
a national conference. The idea of a national conference is 
nothing new. It has already been conducted in many countries, 
and the results are positive,, writes the leader for the 
Movement For the Establishment of Democracy, Marc Bazin. He 
states in his article that there is no other peaceful and 
reasonable alternative than the national conference. The return 
to guerrilla techniques would be devastating and would only 
facilitate the return to dictatorship. On the other hand, to use 
and manipulate the tragedy of the boat people in order to take 
power would be completely inexcusable, inhumane and 
reprehensible. We are quoting some excerpts from Marc Bazin's 
article in THE MIAMI HERALD of 16 January. The former prime 
minister concludes, quote: A national conference should be, 
above all, an invitation to a realistic, fair and practical 
compromise, 
unquote.

  [Text] Julio Larosiliere, senator of the southeast [as 
heard], says he is willing to accept the leadership of the next 
cabinet. I am not campaigning because of my status as senator, 
but if I was called, I would not hesitate to become the next 
prime minister, he stated. Moreover, he said he is competent for 
such a post. 
  [Begin Larosiliere recording] "I must clearly tell you that 
it is not a matter of [word indistinct]. It is a matter of 
capability, it is a matter of sacrifice." At this time, Senator 
Larosiliere is a man who can perform the functions of prime 
minister in Haiti. If I could not, I would say: No, I cannot. 
But I feel I can. So, if I am invited, if this post is offered 
to me, "I will accept, and I believe it is one of the best 
choices that could be made. If some believe that I am taking 
steps just so I can become prime minister, I can say other 
things are involved." I think that I am here to serve the 
nation, but I will not take any steps because I have a mandate 
as senator; I am very proud to be a senator and I would be happy 
to remain in Parliament to do that job. I am repeating the 
following for you: If "they see that I can contribute to a way 
out of the crisis, I am ready; and I believe the people as well 
as President Aristide, the Armed Forces, and all sectors in this 
country will not send flowers to me--so to say-- because I do 
not hold the post, but I am sure that the results will be 
positive if I do occupy this post." [as heard] [end recording] 
  This was Sen. Julio Larosiliere, who is available to occupy 
the post of prime minister.

  [Excerpts] Frantz Robert Monde, new president of the 
Chamber of Deputies and a member of the Socialist bloc presented 
himself on 17 January as an arbiter between the various 
political sensitivities of this institution and as a democrat. 
Mr. Monde, who addressed a news conference, pointedly refuted 
the label of extremist. Recalling his past as a Duvalierist 
militant and his current democratic commitment, he stated that 
only God and idiots do not change. The Haitian democracy must 
be a struggle of ideas but not of men, he added, while coming 
out in favor of a national conference to get out of the crisis. 
We, Haitians, must sit around a table to work out a strategy to 
get out of the crisis, a strategy that would honor the country, 
he stated. [passage omitted] 
  Monde said he is against reducing the Haitian Army as 
requested by some political sectors, but he does wish to create 
a police force to solve the problem of repression in Haiti. 
[passage omitted] 
  Furthermore, he pointed out that he had warned the officials 
of the Revolutionary Front Haitian Advancement and Progress, 
FRAPH, the main neo-Duvalier party, that he would not tolerate a 
deputy being manhandled or persecuted by this group. He met with 
the leader of this group, Mr. Louis Jodel Chamblain. Any deputy 
must be able to go to his district, he pointed out, while saying 
he is ready, if necessary, to accompany some parliamentarians. 
He also assured the press of his support, asserting that he 
will firmly intervene every time a journalist has problems in 
fulfilling his duty. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Juan Carlos Roque Garcia </F>
and guests JUVENTUD REBELDE reporters Osvaldo Rodriguez and Jose 
Alejandro Rodriguez -- live] 
  [Text] [Roque Garcia] Good afternoon, friends. Today's 
Straight Talk topic will be interesting. We always choose 
interesting topics, but there are times when we broach issues 
that truly worry the people. Today's topic will be one of those: 
The banking policy and how it can contribute to improved 
domestic finances. To broach this topic, I have invited JUVENTUD 
REBELDE reporters Osvaldo Rodriguez and Jose Alejandro 
Rodriguez. Are you brothers? 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] We are brothers, we are brothers but we 
are not related. However, we do have the same patronymic and 
matronymic. 
  Yes Juan Carlos, I do believe this is an interesting topic. 
The implementation of a single measures will not solve the 
domestic finance problems. Budget control, taxes, and banking 
policies, on their own, will not solve the problem. The problem 
will be solved by implementing a group of measures. These 
measures must be aimed at gathering the excess currency and 
maintaining a balance after this is done. It would be useless to 
gather the excess currency and face the same situation later. 
Financial stability is important from the banking viewpoint. 
  [Roque Garcia] And that is what we want to talk about. 
First, 
let us think about something. Of the approximately 11 billion 
[currency not specified] in excess currency, half of that is in 
the banks. If much of what is still on the streets were in the 
bank, the problem would not be that big. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] We must find a solution to those 
problems. I believe that one of these problems is our current 
banking policy, or, if not implemented correctly, the banking 
policy we will have once the new measures are implemented. We 
must immobilize as much currency as possible. Money in the bank 
is immobilized money. Money that is immobilized does not 
circulate on the black market. Money that does not circulate on 
the black market is money that will not devaluate our currency. 
Therefore, I believe it would be logical to immobilize as much 
of that excess currency as possible. 
  [Roque Garcia] Pepe [nickname for Jose], do you agree with 
this? 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Yes, I do. However, Juan Carlos, 
I 
believe that to solve this problem, to search for the different 
ways to solve it -- we must launch a frontal attack and hit them 
from every side -- we must first change the way the bank deals 
with the people. That is the most important thing. The bank must 
begin by encouraging the people to put their money in the bank. 
For example, interest rates. Something must be done about this. 
I also believe that we must study some of the measures that have 
been suggested. Some of the measures suggested are a bit too 
drastic. I have heard people say.... 
  [Roque Garcia, interrupts] Measures proposed. 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Yes, proposed. 
  [Roque Garcia] That is correct, that is correct. 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] I have people say: No, no, I can 
have a certain amount of money. I believe this must be handled 
in an economic manner. Everything has a bit of political lacing, 
but we must also remember that if we are promoting a savings 
policy, we cannot create measures that will discourage what we 
are trying to get the people to do, which is to save. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] What we must determine is who has the 
money. How they earned that money. 
  [Roque Garcia] That is correct. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] How they got that much money and how 
they 
got to save that amount of money. 
  [Roque Garcia] But that is not the bank's problem. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] No, it is not. It is what Pepe was 
talking about. We cannot change the cause to ensure a final 
objective. The bank's objective is to immobilize the money. What 
the police and investigation groups must do is find out where 
this person got all that money from. 
  [Roque Garcia] The so-called hoarders, for example. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] The so-called hoarders. Here in Cuba we 
have many hoarders who earned their money in a very honest 
manner. Perhaps, but mistake were made, or there was excess 
profit, or there were state-made mistakes -- they made much 
money, but it was honestly earned. Therefore, we must 
differentiate in the way we handle these people, or these 
comrades. But it is not the bank's duty to do this. 
  The man who made his money illegally does not put his money 
in the bank. That man is afraid of putting his money in the bank. 
  [Roque Garcia] We are looking for coinciding points of view 
between what we are discussing here and what is being said on 
the streets. There were things broached during the first part of 
the program which I am not very clear on. What do you think, 
Jose Alejandro? 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] I was very surprised by a.... 
  [Roque Garcia, interrupts] A term he used. 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] That is correct. I believe that 
many people must be thinking about this. He used two words: 
hoarders and honest. Some people may be thinking that these two 
words do not go hand in hand. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] What you say is true, and I believe it 
needs further explanation. We say that anyone who has a lot of 
money is a hoarder. There are many people in Cuba who have made 
a lot of money in an honest way: for example, the farmers. There 
are farmers who have hundreds of thousands of pesos and who 
earned this money honestly. Is there a more honest way of making 
money than by working the land? 
  [Roque Garcia] I agree. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] There also are hundreds of craftsmen who 
have earned hundreds of thousands of pesos honestly. They were 
able to earn this money because of the price of handicrafts, 
because of the policies established for these products, and 
because these products are not taxed. The other day we were 
talking about taxes. Were these farmers taxed on what they do, 
perhaps they would not have been able to accumulate the hundreds 
of thousands of pesos they have today. However, there are others 
who have hundreds of thousands of pesos and have no way of 
showing how they got that money. They have not worked a day in 
their lives and have no way of showing how they got that money. 
  But there is another problem, you mentioned the banks. That 
is a mistake; banks do not exist to find out where the money is 
coming from. Banks are there to receive and keep the money I 
deposit. Even though one topic leads to the other, this is not 
the issue we are discussing today. So let us go back to today's 
topic: A banking policy to ensure that our domestic finances 
will return to normal. As Pepe said, that policy should 
encourage the people to save as much as possible. The bank 
should have good interest rates that will encourage the people. 
I want to earn something on what I save. A good interest rate 
must be established so that the people will go and deposit their 
money in the banks. The people must trust the banks. 
  [Roque Garcia] I do believe that people trust banks. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Yes, but as Pepe Alejandro said, the 
banks must not be made into a coercive instrument. A bank is 
there to receive the money that is deposited. If today I were to 
take 2 million pesos to the People's Bank and tell them that I 
want to keep my money there, they cannot go around finding out 
where it came from. 
  [Roque Garcia] I would have you investigated immediately. 
[laughter] 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] But that is not what a bank is for. 
  [Roque Garcia] I agree. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] The bank must accept my 2 million pesos 
and pay me the established interest rates. Today's interest 
rates are too low. 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] It is only 2 or 3 percent. 
Sometimes not even that. It is 2 percent per annum. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Why should we be afraid of someone being 
able to live off the interest he is getting from his savings? If 
a worker has been working for 25 and 30 years and he has saved 
money in the bank in the hope that when he retires he can have 
some extra money to live off, then why not? It can happen. 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Osvaldo, there are other 
problems. 
The banks have a thousand and one ways to encourage people to 
save. For example, at this moment when there is such a big 
difference between the excess currency on the street and the 
lack of goods to be purchased, we can encourage the people to 
save by establishing a plan by which after they have saved for a 
specific period of time they can buy certain products that 
cannot be purchased on the market. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Durable goods. 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] That is correct, durable goods. 
For example, if you have saved quite a bit of money, after two 
years you can purchase a television set or a refrigerator. This 
would be an incentive. This could be a way of encouraging the 
people to put their money in the bank. 
  [Roque Garcia] These are strategies that must be considered. 
We must keep these ideas in mind, especially today when we are 
trying to improve our domestic finances. 
  [Roque Garcia] We are here today with JUVENTUD REBELDE 
reporters Osvaldo Rodriguez and Jose Alejandro Rodriguez. We are 
talking about a banking policy that could contribute to 
improving domestic finances. The bank cannot utilize coercive 
methods. We are clear on that. However, there are rumors. What 
can we expect? 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Juan Carlos, you know Cubans. We 
are always talking about things, about everything. And boy, can 
we smell things! People see things changing, and they talk about 
it. 
  [Roque Garcia] That is the people for you. 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] That is correct. However, there 
are some who want the banks to assume a repressive role. They 
want the banks to handle social phenomena that must be solved by 
other means. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] That is why I said a while ago that we 
must have trust in the banks. 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Bank policies are policies that 
have been around for hundreds of years. This is worldwide. These 
are policies that cannot be ignored. The relationship between 
the bank and the client must be one of trust and flexibility. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] They must be very careful about how they 
treat people. The client should not be kept waiting. 
  [Roque Garcia] There are times when you get to the bank and 
you have to wait in line for a long time because it takes 
forever to complete a transaction. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] Going back to what you and Pepe were 
saying: I believe that banks cannot, under any circumstance, put 
conditions on my money. The bank is there to hold my money. That 
is it. When I want to withdraw my money, even if I want to 
withdraw every single peso I have deposited, even 100,000 pesos, 
the bank has to give me my 100,000 pesos plus the interest 
accrued. The bank uses that money. The bank uses the money I 
deposit. The bank uses my money, your money, and everyone's 
money for its own operations. Therefore, the bank cannot 
condition my deposits. The people would lose all trust in banks 
if they begin imposing coercive measures. I believe that those 
who are suggesting that the banks implement coercive measures 
are mistaken. Banks must protect the trust the people have in 
them. 
  [Roque Garcia] I agree with you. I believe that this is the 
correct path. We have only expressed our opinions. We are not 
judges and the banks are not in the dock. We are not 
specialists. All we are doing is analyzing the problem. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] We are only observing the situation. 
  [Roque Garcia] As Osvaldo just said, we are observing the 
situation and we cannot ignore what the people are saying. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] There is something else that the banks 
could implement, which I believe would be good. I am talking 
about time deposits. All foreign banks do this. It is similar to 
something that we are doing here. 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] The fixed fund account [cuenta de 
fondo fijo]. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] No, creation of the fund [formacion de 
fondo]. 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] Creation of the fund. 
  [Osvaldo Rodriguez] This fund is a payroll-deductible 
account. You set aside a certain amount for a specific time; in 
other words, you freeze that money. After a specific amount of 
time, you get your money back with interest. Time deposits are 
similar to this. The only difference is that you deposit a 
specific amount in a lump sum and decide how long you want to 
keep it in the bank, be it six or 12 months, or the time 
established by the bank. This provides much higher interest, and 
keeps that money immobilized. These are options that the banks 
must analyze at this time when we are looking for ways to 
improve our domestic finances. 
  [Jose Alejandro Rodriguez] We must establish a balance, and 
for this to be possible, it is important to have a good rapport 
between the banks and the people. This rapport must not be 
tainted by any type of repressive or restraining measures.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the </F>
National Assembly of the People's Government, on "special 
Straight Talk" program by Straight Talk host Carlos Santana 
Ojeda and reporters Luis Sexto from BOHEMIA; Renato Recio from 
TRABAJADORES; and Radio Rebelde reporters Gisela Bel Heredia and 
Roberto Cabada -- live] 
  [Text] [Santana] The second session of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], which was recently 
held analyzed and left pending many important economic issues 
related to the situation the country is going through, 
especially those related to the internal financial situation. 
This special "Straight Talk" program will center its debate on 
these issues, the experience of the ANPP in 1993, and its goals 
for 1994 with the participation of Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, 
member of the Politburo and president of the ANPP. 
  We will begin with Luis Sexto. Luis, how do you think we 
should begin this analysis? 
  [Sexto] Perhaps the listeners are waiting for me to ask Dr. 
Ricardo Alarcon the first question on what today is the center 
or the focus of the national debate: the measures that are being 
studied and drafted to achieve a financial balance in our 
country. Violating a journalistic rule, I want to leave the most 
interesting topic for last. On this occasion, I will take that 
liberty. I want to ask Dr. Ricardo Alarcon about democracy. 
History shows that generally times of crisis are not appropriate 
for the exercise of democracy. Nevertheless, in our country, 
despite our problems, there is a will and a commitment to 
perfect democracy. As a matter of fact, in the last two years 
our country has made a qualitative leap. I ask you: Is this a 
fact that has ended or is it a process, and if this is a process 
as I believe it is, what is you point of view and what will the 
future bring? 
  [Alarcon] Well, Luis, I believe you are absolutely right. 
For 
some time now, we have been advancing in perfecting the 
country's governmental system, or the system of the People's 
Government which consists in just that: the perfecting and 
strengthening of our democracy. Traditionally, the classic trend 
in the world is that when there is a difficult situation, a 
crisis, or a special situation, democracy is restricted as a 
natural thing. All countries in their constitutions have 
chapters on states of emergency. It even includes the 
suppression of certain rights, etc. Some even include the right 
to hold elections and the parliamentary function. The 
parliaments of this world, many of them, went into recess when 
the country had some difficulties, which, if we compare them 
with the problems of Cuba, were truly minor problems. 
  We are doing the exact opposite. In this and in many other 
things we could say that we follow a nontraditional path. 
However, I believe it does correspond with our characteristics 
and needs. In other words, despite the greater difficulties and 
challenges of the country, we must continue advancing in the 
people's participation in the government system. To continue 
perfecting this system means to rely more on the people, summon 
the people, use their effective, real and systematic 
participation on what is...[30 second break in reception] 
...what their government should be. 
  This seems like a paradox. Nevertheless, because of its 
principles, a socialist government or society by definition is 
the fullness of democracy: a true democracy, a democracy of the 
people according to the Greek language, where the word came 
from. This implies the people truly participate in the 
government. This only happens in socialism, in a society based 
on equality, fairness, and human solidarity which truly 
advocates the people's participation in the government as equals 
and collectively. This is the aspect of principles. 
  However, there is also a strategic aspect. How can we 
successfully confront the enormous challenges Cuba faces if we 
do not do so with the conscientious, true, voluntary, and 
energetic participation of the entire people. This is something 
we see in our daily lives: the efforts, the sacrifices of our 
people, the burden they must shoulder. Only by relying on the 
people, in my opinion, will we be able to become successful in 
confronting today's difficulties. All this relates to the issue 
you left for the end. We try to make the people participate, to 
make them feel more and more they are participants -- as the 
subject of the society rather than a passive object -- in issues 
such as the financial situation and many others. This is the 
essence of democracy. This can only be attained through 
socialism. 
  [Santana] I believe that the subject of perfecting of 
democracy has been thoroughly covered. We can move on to another 
subject. Renato? 
  [Recio] Evidently, we need to now touch on the cardinal 
issue 
on the streets. I believe that at the last session of the ANPP 
something unusual happened when contrary to expectations, 
particularly those abroad regarding the impending approval of an 
entire package of measures, the ANPP decided to simply discuss, 
report, increase awareness, and enlighten public opinion rather 
than make decisions. Evidently, this is not usual. Something 
else that is unusual in other societies is happening now, a 
so-called parliament of the workers has been summoned, and those 
issues which the ANPP discussed regarding the financial 
reorganization are becoming issues of public discussion, of 
discussion by the masses, of discussion by millions. 
  I will like Alarcon to give us his opinion and comments on 
this process. What does it mean for him? What can be expected 
from it? 
  [Alarcon] This is a very important issue because it relates 
to the expectation you mentioned that existed before the ANPP 
meeting. There was much talk of measures, packages of measures, 
etc. 
  We have to clarify several things. We have been implementing 
measures such as the creation of the Basic Cooperative 
Production Units [UBPC], a concrete measure which is already 
helping to heal the national finances in two sectors where a 
good part of state subsidies are concentrated: sugarcane and 
nonsugarcane agriculture. Above all, this should result in an 
increase in production in both sectors which is the essence, the 
ultimate goal to heal the finances and improve the economy, 
rescue the value of the peso, stimulate work, etc. Why? To be 
able to produce more goods and services, to produce more and 
better to benefit our economy. Certain comrades have the 
simpleminded hope that certain measures could be implemented on 
the assumption that certain measures can solve the problem, as 
if someone were stupid enough to have the answer to make our 
lives better in his pocket and not use it. Unfortunately, that 
is not the case. There are certain things that can and have been 
done, such as the example I just gave about the UBPC. 
  We cannot forget, particularly you who work in journalism, 
that there are foreign ideas, things they try to impose on us 
such as the expression "package of measures". This is a concept 
that any listener immediately associates with many packages of 
measures that have been implemented in the world apparently in 
order to solve financial problems. I would like to ask if anyone 
could name a single Third World country that has solved its 
economic problems, been able to mend its finances, and above all 
reactivate development and improve the living conditions of its 
people's with any of those packages of measures. Every example 
points to the contrary: People are rising up in the provinces in 
Latin America and even attacking the governor's palace. 
  Why? Either because a package of measures was not 
implemented 
or because it was? A package of measures is associated in the 
world with capitalism, with neoliberal formulas, with the IMF, 
with things that are already classics: a budget deficit? Then 
expenses have to be reduced. How do you reduce expenses in the 
capitalist world? By cutting social programs, privatizing, and 
decreasing the role of the state in society. 
  We have to study measures to reduce the size of the state, 
reduce the bureaucracy, the burden bureaucracy represents to the 
state, etcetera. However, this is quite different from 
diminishing the responsibility of the state -- in other words, 
of society in relation to the people. 
  We face a great challenge. How to fix the finances, how to 
implement our measures, those which we have taken and will take 
in the future. However, we cannot use any of the tools out 
there. That would be very easy. There would be no need to 
discuss or invent anything. The IMF measures are repeated 
everywhere. It is not possible to invent different ones, at 
least coming from that perspective. However, measures with a 
socialist perspective, for socialism, have to be created in a 
socialist manner. 
  There are general measures which as a matter of fact we have 
been implementing in the economy, and there have been 
discussions with the workers in every factory and service 
center, etcetera. We are doing this not only to collect the 
comrades' opinions on these problems but also to relate the 
solutions to each place's specific condition. It is possible to 
improve efficiency by reducing costs, waste, improving 
organization, increasing discipline, etcetera, with the concrete 
action of the workers in each workplace, rather than with a 
parliamentary address or a decision of a general nature. 
  Therefore, as part of the process of preparing for the 
special ANPP meeting, we are now beginning with a process of 
discussion by the workers. We hope this discussion is well 
structured and organized. In other words, the first step must be 
adequate information from the leadership, the basic data on the 
specific work center, production costs, resources, etcetera, in 
other words, all the objective material elements of that 
workplace. It has to be a collective discussion among all 
workers to see what can be done there and now, rather than 
waiting for a grandiloquent quote legislative unquote decision. 
The idea is take steps here and now to help mend the national 
finances. 
  [Recio] Some people are claiming that this might be a 
government strategy to free itself of responsibility in the end 
when the measures are taken and they affect a sector of the 
population which has already debated the measures and approved 
them. 
  [Alarcon] This brings to mind a friend, an Italian 
legislator 
who visited us in October. We went together to see the 
functioning of the people's government. We attended a progress 
report meeting in the outskirts of Havana where very complex 
problems were discussed. The Italian told me: "The president of 
our parliament has never, never attended a meeting with the 
people, even less, of course, in a shanty like this. I, a 
leftist deputy, had never done it either. I have seen here in 
action what a truly democratic society is." 
  The people debated intensely, without rhetoric or 
formalisms. 
They said what was on their minds about their problems from 
deeply revolutionary and patriotic perspectives. He added: "This 
cannot be done in my country because it would end in a great 
fracas between the people and their deputy, even more with the 
president of the parliament." 
  In reality, to discuss the kind of issues with the 
people....[changes thought] It is still to be seen the first 
case of a country where the famous packages of measures are 
implemented and someone has the brilliant idea of discussing it 
with the workers. 
  [Santana] I have never seen the IMF or [World] Bank 
suggesting such a thing. 
  [Alarcon] Even less, asking the worker's opinions before 
adopting measures. This also helps to create a mind set. The 
people get to express themselves and might become convinced of 
one possibility or another which might not be the most 
appropriate at a certain moment. First of all, the ANPP -- and 
this has been acknowledged in dispatches by several foreign news 
agencies which I have read -- discussed information on the Cuban 
economy that is usually handled with more discretion, and this 
was broadcast from coast to coast to the entire population. 
Information such as the size of the deficit, the subsidies, 
etcetera, and unpaid accounts was discussed openly. 
  This is the opposite of the practice of famous parliaments 
which perhaps meet for three months with an overabundance of 
speeches but where the information is not handled as openly. To 
me, this is very important. I said this in the ANPP meeting, and 
other comrades also said that other parliaments do not openly 
discuss packages of measures, but they do so with the 
millionaires; they do so with the great powers of the economy of 
those countries. It might be that the unions will not even find 
out until they read the papers. It might be that certain 
legislators are in the dark about the packages of measures that 
are going to be promulgated. However, those who truly control 
the economy in those countries are made aware and agreements are 
reached with them. In our case, we would have to do it backwards 
-- our millionaires are the workers, the people -- also, even in 
order to discuss, and this can be done, possible measures which 
perhaps are not pleasant or well seen by a sector of the 
population. [as heard] 
  [Santana] Alarcon, I find it interesting that this process 
of 
consultation involves only the workers. However, there are 
sectors of the population such as housewives, retirees, and 
students who also have their opinions on probable measures to 
mend the economy. What is the ANPP planning to do to include 
these opinions? 
  [Alarcon] We also have to think about the other sectors of 
the population. However, there are several basic reasons why 
this process began with the labor movement. First of all, 
because it relates directly to production and services. This is 
the core of the economic problems. Second, because the union 
movement in our society has to play its proper role. 
  The union movement is the vanguard of society. It is the 
class that has to exert its hegemony, its leadership. Because of 
the concrete experiences of the meetings which I have attended 
and the ones I have been told about by other comrades, I know 
they are yielding specific results that can begin to have an 
effect right now to improve the national financal picture. Of 
course, when we speak of workplaces, this also includes 
educational centers. We have included the youth, students, 
teachers of that sector. 
  I believe that in a later phase we have to see how to attain 
through the People's Council the participation of other sectors 
of the population not organized in unions. 
  [Bel] Deputies who belong to a workplace also are found in 
People's Councils and can be of aid in the discussions at that 
level. 
  [Recio] I believe all Cubans must be quite clear on this, we 
must reach a consensus on that no measure can -- as you 
mentioned earlier -- solve the national problems right away. In 
other words, they are not a magic wand or a magician's hat: A 
measure is implemented and the problem is solved. 
  In other words, these are measures we have to necessarily 
adopt to solve part of the problems. Certain measures have 
already been taken. You mentioned an essential one. 
  Now, regarding the financial unbalance: There is an opinion 
out there. I have had to discuss it. However, I would like you 
to speak about it. Some say that if these measures have to be 
taken we are already late. They argue that this process of 
collective discussion is a delay that unnecessarily protracts 
the implementation of measures which will help solve our 
problems. I would like you to explain why this is not a waste of 
time. 
  [Alarcon] I believe it is necessary. For example, the budget 
deficit: If an organization or enterprise is inefficient, in 
other words, it costs more money to the people than what it 
contributes, [words indistinct] this is very simple: Close it 
down. However, if in the budget of an organization expenses 
surpass income they have to reduce expenses to match income. 
Under capitalism this is solved quite simply: How many surplus 
workers are there? How many enterprises are you going to close 
down? Etcetera. 
  Is it not a measure discussing the situation of the 
enterprise, factory, or institution with its workers so that 
among them, with the data at hand, with the same openness with 
which the information on the national economy was disclosed, 
they can discuss and understand what needs to be done in case 
there is no other alternative but to take certain measures that 
affect them? What measures can they, the workers, the owners of 
the society adopt to mend their finances, to reduce costs and 
make their work more rational? This is why I say that this 
discussion process is an extremely important measure, or a total 
of very important measures we hope will be adopted throughout 
Cuba. 
  On the other hand, I believe that it is somewhat 
simpleminded 
if you were to say that by implementing this measure from the 
top, beginning tomorrow, the situation will begin to change. We 
are not sitting on our hands, thinking about measures. On the 
contrary, they are being adopted. For example, we mentioned the 
UBPC, but there is self-employment, and even the famous 
decriminalization of foreign currency. These are measures that 
also effect the national finances but which by definition did 
not require a process of consultation, of increasing the 
awareness of the people. As soon as we understood how to 
implement them, we did it even before the ANPP met. 
  There are cooperatives that are costing less than a [state] 
farm in certain places, that have attracted workers -- in other 
words, there are healthy signs -- and have reduced costs. There 
are concrete results you can see. Nobody has refrained from 
implementing measures that are clearly defined, measures that 
have clear and immediate implications. What is important here is 
to elevate the morale of the workers. Fidel pointed out that 
work is attained through pride, honor. Well, we have to appeal 
to that pride and honor and consolidate them in specific 
measures to be taken at each place. This is one of the most 
important things that can be done. This would not be based on 
that famous package of measures, but would be based on something 
we can do here and cannot be done elsewhere: to appeal to the 
workers and frankly discussing with them all these problems 
specifically, calling them by their right name and not using 
general terms. 
  [Recio] I would like to ask Alarcon about an issue based on 
the experiences other countries have had when they mix these two 
concepts: democracy and the economy. It is known that in most of 
the countries implementing neoliberal formulas of economic 
reorganization and readjustment, democracy, the functioning of 
democracy is hampered in many cases and there are sad, regretful 
events. However, based on Alarcon's words on the previous 
program, democracy in Cuba, the development of our democracy 
could be a force to possiblyt help the economy recover. I would 
like Alarcon to tell us about this issue. 
  [Alarcon] This has to be developed to its fullest extent. I 
have seen in some assemblies....[changes thought] For example, 
in terms of the two issues of the greatest importance in this 
society: the surplus administrative personnel -- of workers not 
directly linked to production, and the problems of lack of 
controls which result in lost resources, crime, etcetera. We can 
find places, such as I have seen in some of these meetings, 
where the workers are of the opinion that there is surplus 
administrative personnel. Sometimes this is the result of our 
methods, mechanisms still in effect which I believe we have to 
eliminate or change. At times, we demand much unnecessary 
information or work which implies repetition of work mechanisms 
at the base level. This generates bureaucratic positions. In a 
factory there might be need of productive work, a space for 
those adminsitrative workers. It is not a matter of throwing 
anyone on the streets. I am thinking about the specific case of 
La Corona factory where we discussed these issues with the 
workers on 12 January. 
  On the other hand, although at times we have an excess of 
administrative mechanisms which are there to exert control, it 
is evident that control is not one the best functioning things 
in our society. There are way too many problems in this area. In 
that meeting the workers stated that the union and workers 
should and ought to play a much more important, active role. If 
the organized workers discuss things collectively and 
democratically, and establish specific principles and work 
standards, they can replace a bureaucratic mechanism. Not only 
that. They can implement a much more effective mechanism in 
terms of real control and committed discipline and more definite 
order. 
  Now, I believe that besides all of this, our country has 
confronted a difficult situation, a situation of blockade, of 
confronting the abrupt changes in our foreign trade relations -- 
the things we know shaped the special period. Likewise, the 
country attempts to resist these setbacks and to develop, while 
preserving that which I believe reflects the broadest national 
consensus. I do not think anyone here is crazy enough to wish 
for a return to private medicine. No one here is crazy enough to 
hope for Cuba to have the situation of the richest capitalism 
country -- the United States, where today they are debating if 
40 million Americans are finally going to have some degree of 
paid medical coverage; paid, because not even in their dreams 
can American conceive of free medical care. If socialism did not 
exist, Could any Cuban conceive of the barestl possibility of 
upholding such a vital accomplishment, which is reflected in the 
low infant and maternal mortality rate, and a number of things 
which are truly dear to most people? Could anyone be 
simpleminded enough to imagine this would exist in Cuba if our 
socialism did not exist? Evidently, not. 
  The same can be said of education, elder care, and our 
entire 
social security system. To preserve all that, to save all this 
requires the effort and sacrifice of all. We have to turn this 
hope into a daily thing. The struggle for these hopes has to 
become a real, daily, permanent thing. This can only be done 
with the support of the people. This is not going to be the 
result of decisions or conclusions reached by a sharp, 
well-intended, etcetera, group of people. This requires the 
understanding and support of the entire population of workers of 
Cuba. This is why I believe they are inseparable. However, given 
our type of democracy and the conditions Cuba faces, it is not 
only a matter of principles but a philosophical reason which 
should be our political hope: to perfect our political system. 
This is the only possible strategy to really maintain the 
mobilization and struggle of a people who have resisted 
heroically and have amply proven that they will be able to 
confront and overcome this entire challenge. 
  [Cavada] A question in connection with this idea and even 
that of the Parliament in the Work Place: At the beginning many 
perhaps might have thought that a tobacco worker -- such as you 
mentioned from La Corona, or perhaps a metallurgy industry 
worker -- could not give his opinions and decide or propose 
things for the economy or the future economy of Cuba. However, I 
believe that in the practice it has been different. This is 
proven by another of our accomplishments in the last 35 years: 
the educational level of the people. I also was at the tobacco 
factory on 12 January, and it was truly impressive to hear a 
tobacco worker -- in charge of the tobacco refrigeration unit -- 
speak of the law of value, analyzed scientifically what it 
entailed to increase production, what products to increase, 
which to decrease, and even cited how harmful elements in other 
countries collect the excess currency. 
  This is why I think it is a very healthy and logical 
practice, on the part of the CTC and the ANPP, to summon an 
extensive debate. What limits or points might it reach? How much 
longer might this involvement of the people last after the 
special session of the ANPP? 
  [Alarcon] I believe we must continue it. I believe that 
presently it is directly tied to these issues, but it is also 
part of the process of perfecting our system of government. I 
believe that the CTC has to play a key role. It should be 
maintained as a practice, system, and as a method of management, 
organization, and control. The effective, real participation of 
the workers in the economy is consubstantial with a socialist 
democracy. I do not believe that in this or in the case of the 
People's Councils we have reached perfection or anything like 
it. This is why we speak of perfecting. This is a continuous 
process of seeking how to do things better. 
  You gave a great example, that of the comrade in charge of 
the tobacco refrigeration unit. Unfortunately, it would have 
been surprising to find such an example in Cuba several 
generations ago. However, this is now common everywhere. We have 
a people much more highly educated, a cultured people, a people 
ready to exert further their rights and social function, their 
active role in society. 
  [Sexto] I want to change the focus from perfecting the 
system. These measures being discussed nationally are to solve 
immediate problems such as the excess currency, financial 
unbalance, etcetera. Are these measures not also part of a 
necessary effort to correct our economy? Can we speak of 
political correction without speaking of economic correction? 
  [Alarcon] I believe that -- we have said it several times -- 
they are deeply interrelated. I believe that, first of all, we 
cannot separate the economy from politics. We have a socialist 
perspective. The struggle, particularly in a blockaded country, 
a country with our difficulties, or even without those 
difficulties, to build a socialist society -- a society based on 
equality, justice, and fraternity -- also has a material, 
economic dimension. This means a need to produce more goods and 
to provide a higher quality of life to the people, but above all 
to fulfill a group of ideals, ethical aspirations which have to 
do with the conscience -- the conscience we effect politically. 
  I believe that although we are highly involved in the 
reorganization of our finances, the economic struggle in 
general, and in confronting the special period, these 
mechanisms, these methods are not designed for this struggle 
alone. Their effect and lifespan should not be limited to this 
period. I am convinced we are going to surpass the special 
period. I am convinced that we are going to put our finances in 
order, that we are going to successfully resist this phase and 
make progress. We will also continue making progress in the 
perfecting of our political system which is also essential in 
order to continue the economic development and the development 
of a socialist economy and society. 
  [Sexto] On what do you base the hope that we are going to 
surpass the special period, that we are going to overcome this 
entire situation? 
  [Alarcon] I do not want to sound overconfident or anything 
like that. However, without stressing the essential need to 
continue struggling hard....[changes thought] I said this to the 
deputies when I wished them a happy new year. This relates to 
Marx's famous quote: Happiness is the struggle. I told the 
deputies: I wish for all of us to continue struggling united and 
hard. 
  I believe it is not a waste of time to value the feat of 
our people. For four years we have been living in a world where 
all its experts vainly predicted our death. These also have been 
very difficult years where we have had to rethink a number of 
things, seek new markets, and abruptly reorganize our economy on 
completely different bases. I believe as hard as the problems 
are there is something we cannot forget: These four years have 
demonstrated our people's capability to resist. We cannot deny 
that there are people who may have weakened. That is what the 
entire criminal policies of the Yankees, the whole blockade 
seeks. They seek to attract peoples, tear away certain sectors 
of the population from the patriotic and united attitude the 
immense majority of the people upholds. I believe that our 
people's unique show of resistance is truly significant. In the 
last four years, several governments have collapsed under less 
dramatic conditions that those faced by the Cuban Government. 
They have fallen like a house of cards. There have been many 
changes in the world, even people with frustrations and lost 
illusions who now wish for the socialism of certain European 
societies. 
  There have been great changes in the world. And this small 
country, located in the worst of places, is the only socialist 
country that is far away from the former socialist bloc and too 
close to the empire. Yet, here we are, and it is even possible 
to discern signs of progress amidst this crisis. Tourism is 
growing. In Cuba, tourism is growing at one of the highest rates 
in the world, if not the highest. The accomplishments we have 
attained in certain fields amidst such an adverse situation 
cannot be ignored. I believe that in the measure that that 
spirit, that will is channeled, organized, and boosted we have 
the possibility of showing modest, limited signs of the 
beginning of a recovery in 1994. 
  One example is the sugarcane harvest. There is the real 
possibility that this year's harvest will be more efficient than 
last year's and a little higher in terms of volume of 
production. The sugarcane harvest categorically proves wrong 
those who believed, imagined -- and much was said abroad -- that 
Cuba was inexorably going downwards. For us it is an essential, 
highly significant thing to take this step with the limited 
resources Cuba will receive, but also because it confirms the 
righteousness of the effort we all are conducting. Many other 
examples could be given: the entire science sector, scientific 
research, biotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry, etcetera. 
Step by step, despite all the obstacles and the immense 
competition with the transnationals in this sector, some of our 
products are making headway because they are unique, and also 
because they are useful and effective and our production 
capacity has grown. And all this takes place amidst a truly 
difficult situation. These are the elements for a justified 
optimism. 
  [Sexto] One quick question. I can see that your cautious 
optimism is based on the capability for resistance and work of 
the people, but I also believe that you trust the strategy that 
Cuba is following to overcome this, in the success of this 
strategy. 
  [Alarcon] Of course. I am cautious in terms of the concrete 
results we might see. I am totally and completely confident in 
the correctness of our strategy and the capability for 
resistance and work of our people. 
  [Bel] In all these ongoing debates and in the people's 
mouths 
there are highly generalized terms such as subsidies, taxes, 
confiscations, etcetera. You spoke of the need to work on the 
conscience of the citizens, of acting politically. Are there 
plans to provide new programs to contribute to organizing the 
thinking of the masses in this regard? 
  [Alarcon] I believe that in this we all have to contribute 
with our grain of sand. I believe that what the unions do, what 
we are trying to do in the people's government, what you do in 
the press is using every mean to reach many people, and serving 
as tools for reflection and analysis by the comrades. I believe 
that we have to see these things as issues on which we all have 
to become educated collectively by confronting opinions, views, 
in the search for elements, etcetera. These are issues that in 
another country would be the exclusive realm of the 
intellectuals, the experts, or the powerful. In our case, the 
same thing happens: The owners have to decide on the issues, but 
here all of us are the owners. We have to assume this role 
fully. I believe this is not easy. 
  This is not a simple issue. This is why I answered 
positively when I was asked earlier about the relationship 
between the economy and politics after the special period and 
the present financial situation. 
  I believe that in a society such as this every worker should 
aspire to become a connoisseur of details, of costs, of 
efficiency, and of all the economic fields which are not the 
responsibility alone of the manager hired by an owner. Those 
people managed very well to keep their enterprises running 
efficiently because they sought something called profits. We do 
not have this now. There is no one profiting from our sweat. 
Therefore, we have to be more creative on how we assume the role 
of owner -- of owners in a more noble sense, more open, and 
including the entire people. 
  This is very complex. It is not a matter of becoming 
specialists in a limited fiield of action. I believe that it is 
also very important to develop a collective awareness in society. 
  [Recio] It is going to be one year since the elections of 
1993, a highly significant moment in the history of democracy in 
Cuba and Cuban history itself. Alarcon is perhaps the best 
person to answer the following question: A year has gone by. Is 
that overwhelmingly majoritarian support of socialism, the 
revolution, and the fatherland still there? A year later, what 
changes have taken place in the awareness of the people who did 
not understand well enough the essence of those elections and 
its results? 
  [Alarcon] I deeply believe so. I believe that in the measure 
that times goes by, this cultivated, educated people understand 
even more that what is at stake is the defense of socialism, 
which is everything for us. Even our national identity, the 
possibility of the existence of this land as a sovereign and 
independent nation is inseparable from the project of social 
justice which the Cuban people have undertaken. I believe this 
is the explanation of what we commented on earlier: Why our 
people have resisted so hard for four years of the special 
period while others have not. 
  Regarding the second question: We will, of course, always 
have detractors and this honors us. The day those who live in a 
pseudodemocracy, in a society that uses terms as noble as this 
one to disguise the opposite, to hide the lack of equality and 
therefore the lack of the real authority of the people over its 
government, see our system as praiseworthy would be reason 
enough for us to conduct a self-examination to find out what are 
we doing wrong. 
  I believe that in the political aspect, in general, the 
defense of Cuba's revolutionary project is growing each day 
throughout the world because it is precisely an alternative. As 
long as there is a country which, confronted with immense 
challenges, maintains alive ideals which for many people are but 
dreams of a more noble world, a world based on equity, justice, 
fraternity rather than profit, exploitation, and individual 
selfishness which is capitalism, as long as this exists, there 
is a threat to people who exploit and discriminate in this 
world, as all this keeps the people's dream alive. In the 
political sense, this should be reflected more each day in a 
system of government that is genuinely, truly, and authentically 
of the people, one that is really participatory. I believe that 
despite the enemy campaigns, this is a concept that continues to 
become more deeply rooted, continues to progress. 
  I mentioned the other day an Italian friend who saw 
something 
he cannot do in his country. Here it can be done and will be 
done more and better each day precisely because we have a just 
society and a people aware and capable of sustaining and 
preserving that society, a people who have a great revolution 
made by the people and worthy of the people. 
  [Recio] There is one more question: A special session of the 
ANPP has been announced. What is expected of this special 
session? When will it be held? 
  [Alarcon] It will be held at the appropriate time -- here I 
am returning to the diplomatic language of my previous job 
[laughter]. I believe that it will happen early in the year. The 
session should reflect what was decided in December -- the 
continuation of that discussion which I am sure will be held 
under better conditions, with more preparation, more in-depth 
analysis, accompanied much more by the people as a result of 
this process in which the people are participating. I believe it 
will be held at a time when we are more on the offensive. The 
people are not only talking about finances, but they are acting 
on them everywhere across the land. At the time the ANPP meeting 
is held, I am sure that this process by the unions and ANPP 
deputies and delegates will have attained much more dynamism and 
strength, and this will be reflected in the ANPP meeting.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the </F>
Cuban Workers Federation, by Open Dialogue host Soledad Cruz -- 
live in studio] 
  [Text] [Cruz] As we had announced, Pedro Ross is back with 
us. Many listeners have called in to ask questions that remained 
unanswered during the Open Agenda program. This whole week we 
have been following what I have called Parliament in the Work 
Place. This is a topic of much interest in the country because 
our future and life, and the country's future depend on this 
process. That is why we are all anxious to know how this process 
is going to be conducted and how we can participate. This is 
what I believe is most important. This is truly an exercise of 
participative democracy and is very important because the 
country is experiencing difficult times and strong measures must 
be adopted. In light of our past way of life, it is necessary 
that the people understand the process and contribute to it. 
  Welcome, Pedro Ross. I would also like to thank Pantoja [not 
further identified] for his help in getting the program 
organized. Pantoja has some 19 questions to ask, and I myself 
have five questions sent in by Open Dialogue listeners. However, 
I believe that the first thing we should do is ask you what you 
think has been the most important aspect of this first week of 
meetings. 
  [Ross] Good morning to the listeners of this very 
much-awaited Saturday program. Well Soledad, I believe that the 
seriousness with which the workers have broached the various 
issues up for discussion in the Parliaments in the Work Place 
are broaching these matters has been the most important aspect 
of this first week. This is not only important, but encouraging. 
We have seen a conscientious patriotic sense. I am describing it 
as conscientious because the people are aware of what is being 
discussed, what it entails, and of what they are proposing. They 
are not proposing measures to affect others. They are aware of 
the fact that the measures they are proposing entail some 
sacrifice for them. I have heard workers, people who do not earn 
much, say that we must analyze the issue of price increases; I 
have heard them say that the free public health and education 
systems should not be eliminated. More than 30 percent of the 
country's budget goes to cover these two services. For example, 
there are provinces like Pinar del Rio -- I got back last night 
from Pinar del Rio where Ricardo Alarcon and I attended a 
meeting with provincial leaders -- where 70 percent of the 
budget goes to health and education. 
  I have been amazed at how the people are participating. The 
people are preparing for these meetings. They are reading the 
editorials published by TRABAJADORES, they are listening to the 
opinions expressed by reporters and leaders. Ricardo Alarcon was 
interviewed on this station on this topic. The National Assembly 
of the People's Government [ANPP] was broadcast for everyone to 
understand all that is being done and what the goals are. These 
meetings are an extension of the debates that began at the ANPP; 
however, we are not rehashing what was said at the ANPP. Much 
creativity is observed at these Parliaments in the Work Place. 
  This process we have begun is basically aimed at giving the 
workers the opportunity to analyze the economic situation of 
their workplace, their enterprise, their establishment, their 
shop, or their subsidized unit -- if they work for a subsidized 
unit -- and for them to suggest how they can improve the work 
and how they can change the unprofitable status that most of the 
enterprises have. As everyone knows, only 31 percent of the 
country's enterprises are profitable. If we continue to 
experience this situation, the country will not be able to 
overcome its problems. No matter how many measures are adopted, 
no matter how much excess currency is taken off the street, no 
matter how many taxes are implemented, the situation will not 
change if we do not reverse the economic situation of our 
enterprises. We must contribute to lower budget expenditure. We 
cannot continue to spend more than we have. We have been 
spending more than we have. 
  [Cruz] I have always compared the phenomenon of our economy 
with a basket or a sack. It is full and you keep pulling things 
out. If you do not refill it, it will eventually be empty. This 
is basically what is happening with our economy. 
  [Ross] I compare it with a cow. If you milk the cow time 
after time, but never feed it or give it water, it will get sick 
and eventually die. 
  [Cruz] One of the questions we have received is: How long 
will the streamlining of the economy last? Will it be a month? 
Will it be a year? The rate at which the economic measures are 
adopted worries me. I have heard some people say that they are 
worried because they do not know how long this discussion 
process will last. 
  [Ross] The streamlining of the economy must be a constant 
process. It is a process. The economy must not only be 
streamlined, but also healthy. The economic situation of our 
production and service enterprises and the subsidized 
enterprises will depend on our having the necessary resources to 
fulfill the plans the country has. Therefore, this is something 
we must constantly strive for. This process opens a new cycle of 
economic education for our workers and administrators. We must 
learn that we will only achieve what we want by working 
efficiently. If we have one peso and invest that peso, we must 
find a way to double our investment. This is what will allow us 
to expand. To put it simply, we are seeking to make more than we 
invest. We must be consistent in this. 
  We believe that this process will be extended through late 
February, maybe early March. We must prepare well. We do not 
want this to be a marathon. The idea is not to meet a deadline, 
saying that we have talked to the workers and they agree with 
everything. We are not reaching agreements. We are making 
suggestions. We are analyzing problems, and the people are 
making recommendations. These recommendations are gathered and 
those that can be implemented immediately at a work center are 
implemented. The people want to know when the measures will be 
implemented. We must begin implementing the measures 
immediately, especially those measures aimed at increasing 
economic efficiency, stopping squandering. 
  [Pantoja] To do something like that we do not have to wait 
for an agreement to be reached. 
  [Ross] That is correct. And this is important. What worries 
the people the most are those measures adopted to streamline 
finances, to streamline our financial situation. However, we can 
streamline, but if we do not solve the economic efficiency 
problem, we will end up with this very same situation. This is 
the core of the matter. 
  [Cruz] The people on the street keep asking me one question. 
Social justice is nothing more than equal distribution of the 
money made. The question is: How are we going to make money with 
so many problems? What can be done to increase production? Can 
we produce more despite the problems we encounter with the 
inefficiency, mismanagement, and poor working methods we have? 
These problems have caused our production to decrease. Decreased 
production is also due to the collapse of the socialist bloc and 
the blockade we are experiencing. However, part of this problem 
is due to our inefficiency. 
  [Ross] That is the problem. The socialist bloc has 
collapsed. 
That is a fact and it created this problem. 
  The sugarmills are operating. We must work that sector with 
efficiency. Our country's economy depends on this. During the 
last session of the ANPP. Fidel encouraged us to continue 
producing sugar, to ensure that every single pound of sugar is 
produced. 
  [Pantoja] To produce with quality. 
  [Ross] To produce with quality. Yesterday, Comrade Carlos 
Lage was in Camaguey and talked about this. We depend on our 
sugar to get the oil we need to cover our electricity needs, to 
operate our factories, to operate the transportation we have. 
There is talk that this year, 200 camels, as the train-buses are 
called by the people, will be added to the system and these need 
fuel to operate. That fuel is bought with the money we get from 
our sugar. Sugar brings in most of our foreign exchange. We must 
produce sugar efficiently. Our ton of sugar must yield more. If 
producing a ton of sugar costs us 200 [currency not specified] 
and this is how much we sell it for, then we are getting 
nowhere. If producing it costs us 150 [currency not specified], 
then we have made 50 in profit. But if we produce it for 100 and 
sell it for 200, then we have 100 profit. You know that 100 is 
more than 50. That is what this is all about. The idea is to 
ensure that the available resources are properly utilized by the 
sugar industry and in the canefields and that we work 
efficiently. The most sugar possible must be extracted from 
every piece of sugarcane that reaches the sugar mill, and this 
must be done at the lowest possible cost. 
  The same happens at La Corona tobacco factory we visited the 
other day. It was the workers who told us what was happening. 
The workers told us that 750,000 cigars are not being produced 
because they cannot get the cover leaf, good-quality cover leaf. 
The cigars that are produced are for export purposes. However, 
one and one half the quality leaf needed for the cover was being 
used to produce the cigar. The leaf reached the factory; 
however, it was not used. Perhaps it was damaged in the process 
because it was not treated properly. 
  [Cruz] It was broken. 
  [Ross] It was broken. Perhaps the leaf selection process was 
not properly carried out. Perhaps the wrong type of leaf was 
sent to the section producing another brand of cigar. Once this 
occurs, the leaf must be sent back, and in the process, it is 
damaged or it is never returned to the right place. Many of 
these things happen. Therefore, it is not the same to produce 
5.5 million cigars, as the workers did in 1993, as it is to 
produce 6.250 million cigars. 
  This is what we are talking about. Whatever is up to us to 
produce more efficiently, we must attempt to do with more 
efficiency. That is the heart of the matter. 
  [Pantoja] There is something you mentioned a little while 
ago. Soledad talked about the need to produce. If there is no 
production, there is no welfare and there are no material goods. 
We may have the money, but if there is no production, there is 
no merchandise; and if there is no merchandise, the people 
cannot spend the money, and that money stays in the people's 
pocket. 
  [Cruz] We are at a standstill and this situation must be 
changed. 
  [Ross] I believe the statements Carlos Lage made yesterday 
are very important. They bring us hope; they represent a light 
for us. Lage said last night -- I saw him on television and 
later heard him on the radio -- that there are industries that 
are beginning to produce. Some of these industries began 
producing a few months ago. But he said that there is some 
reactivation. Some reactivation, not much, but that we are 
beginning to see some reactivation of our economy in the 
industrial sector. 
  [Pantoja] Tourism for example. Tourism is a source of 
income for Cuba. 
  [Ross] Tourism produces a profit. That profit will be higher 
to the extent we increase its efficiency, reduce its costs, and 
increase its quality as much as possible. That is what it is all 
about. For example, education is a budget sector where we 
allocate a myriad of resources. We have to try to do a quality 
job, and we have been working toward that goal. 
  This process will also analyze this issue: The quality of 
the 
education and the maximum use and improvement of educational 
mechanisms in order to not squander the budget. We have to try 
to eliminate from the budget those expenses which are at times 
superfluous, are made unnecessary, or are squandered. 
  [Cruz] There is a question regarding all the information I 
have heard on radio and television, and it is in connection with 
a query by a viewer and a listener: If the measures taken are 
anti-popular, what is the state going to do? 
  And I want to comment in this regard: I believe that one of 
the things we have to attain is to educate everyone on different 
principles. I find it frightful how we have developed a 
mentality of rights, yet speak very little of responsibilities. 
We do this with almost everything, even with our children and 
parents. Children have this and that right given to them by the 
constitution as a result of their condition as children, and the 
same is true of youths. However, nowhere does it say what the 
children's responsibilities are to their parents. This is one 
example. 
  The same thing happens with the state and Revolution. 
Everyone has a right to education, everyone has a right to 
health care, everyone has a right, and rights, and rights -- a 
right to retirement benefits, to work, to receive help, to 
everything. What about responsibilities? What are we going to do 
to fulfill them? 
  There are people concerned with anti-popular measures. We 
have to see what we define as anti-popular. When I speak with 
people on the streets from diverse sectors throughout the land, 
the people fiercely criticize egalitarism and that the people 
who do not work have the same rights or more than those who do. 
All this is criticized. There are many people from generations 
that experienced capitalism, for example this lady who wrote to 
us, Ines Pacheco Castillo. She stressed this in her letter in 
which she poured out all her opinions on this issue. She 
experienced capitalism. She said: "We have to understand certain 
things. We cannot continue shaping people with every right since 
birth and yet give them no sense of obligation." 
  In this sense, I believe that there are education and health 
issues which I think are an extremely important accomplishment 
and should be kept free. However, we must also give the 
citizens, as early in life as possible, a sense of 
responsibility. It is incredible how books, which could have 
been preserved, and windows, and school chairs have been broken. 
and how the schools are not cared for in the manner they should 
be. I do believe that there should be tax measures to cover when 
a book, a window, or social property is damaged. It is like the 
state is an open pipe that can provide all these things. 
  [Ross] I believe that until the collapse of the socialist 
bloc many thing were provided too generously and that generosity 
is precisely what provoked our actions. This is my opinion. On 
the other hand, now, having to confront the current problems of 
the economy, the situation of the economic crisis, all these 
problems, and even the capitalist crisis, the world economic 
crisis, this affects us more today because it is undisputable 
that we have to fend for ourselves; thus we feel these crises 
more. We do not have the support or international aid of 
yesterday. Logically, all these things make us do this, change 
our mind set, think differently about problems, because we are 
the ones who have to solve the economic problems. 
  [Cruz] What also happens is: We will have to seek 
ways....[changes thought] I want to know if this has been 
discussed as this viewer commented: If the measures are anti- 
popular, what is the state going to do? 
  [Ross] What are we all going to do. I do not believe that 
the 
measures need to be applauded. They entail an amount of 
sacrifice but are aimed precisely at protecting the people, at 
protecting our accomplishments. 
  I asked this question in Pinar del Rio and repeated it at La 
Corona: "Do we close the Hermanos Ameijeiras Clinical Surgical 
Hospital? If we do not solve this, we have to close the 
hospital. Do you want it to close?" 
  This was followed by everyone's spontaneous protest to the 
contrary. I asked: "Do we close half the schools in Cuba?" What 
is happening in the rest of the continent and the world? We have 
a special situation, have a blockade which makes our situation 
more difficult. 
  [Pantoja] Retirees are conducting a strike in Panama right 
now. 
  [Ross] There are crises in every country, and the solutions 
being implemented are truly anti-popular because in those 
countries the rich do not stop being rich. On the contrary, the 
people become poorer. Here we share the poverty among all of us. 
  [Cruz] Except the profiteers. 
  [Ross] Except the profiteers. Yet, there was a worker at the 
tobacco factory who told Comrade Alarcon: "You, who represent 
the state, are required to take drastic measures against the 
profiteers. We demand this. We are going to solve our problems 
but you have to solve that problem." 
  The people, the workers are already demanding this. A young 
tobacco worker said there: "Why, I who spend eight hours making 
tobacco, when I get to the corner just outside the factory, I 
meet other youths like me selling pullovers and shoes, 
bartering, and having drinks that are impossible to find 
anywhere -- exhibiting the result of the profiting, of the 
theft, of the black market. 
  [Cruz] This also has to do with something Ines Pacheco said 
in her letter. We have to analyze everything in depth because we 
need to take a package of measures. We have to attack the 
problem from many different angles. 
  [Ross] Yes. It has to be a package of measures. We are 
hearing proposals about diverse measures, but not all measures 
will be adopted. 
  [Cruz] Of course. 
  [Ross] From that pool of measures we will have, we will 
adopt 
the most viable and clever ones. Fidel said: "The most clever, 
the least likely to hurt our people." Everything we are doing we 
are doing to solve the dire problems our people confront today. 
  [Cruz] This comrade in her letter wrote about one of these 
problems. She said, regarding our commentary last Saturday [15 
January] about the lack of service workers in hospital and other 
places, that someone gets more money by simply selling his quota 
of rum, coffee, and cigarettes than by working 30 days, and he 
does this without having to work. If the profiteer was unable to 
profit, that person would be forced to get an available job. 
This includes people without a job as well as retirees who want 
to improve their income. 
  [Ross] Thinking such as this teaches us a lot about what 
needs to be done. 
  [Pantoja] Although profiteers are preparing for these 
measures about the money and are investing in properties, buying 
this and that. 
  [Ross] Properties also can be confiscated. Properties bought 
with ill-gotten money can be confiscated. 
  [Cruz] This is precisely one the questions we received: How 
can we tell money is properly or improperly obtained? Do you 
also get this question? 
  [Pantoja] No. There are other questions. 
  [Ross] Our people know. Everyone knows who is who. 
  [Cruz] That is right. We all know in our block who is who. 
We 
know who got a car and new clothes overnight and does not have a 
relative sending dollars. 
  [Pantoja] I have here a listener: Ruben Jeronimo Rodriguez, 
501 25th Street, between H and I in Vedado. He proposes, as part 
of this economic efficiency struggle, an analysis of the 
possibility of making work center managers a person nominated 
and elected by that work center's workers, something similar to 
what is being done in the Basic Cooperative Production Units 
[UBPC]. In the UBPC the state bodies make a proposal but if the 
members disagree they can nominate a UBPC worker, and he becomes 
the manager. In other words, a nomination is presented to the 
UBPC but if the workers disagree they select another person. 
  [Ross] This is the nomination of a member to the UBPC. 
  [Pantoja] Ruben Jeronimo Rodriguez proposes that this also 
be 
done in the work centers. 
  [Ross] In the work centers we already have managers. The 
workers also have the right to remove a manager who does not 
make the best use of resources. This is a right all Cuban 
workers have but we do not exercise it. 
  This is a matter in which our unions have been lacking, 
have not acted, have not exercised that right. Whether or not to 
elect them is not what provides the appropriate person. There is 
a selection process for state enterprise managers. A selection 
process takes place. Now if the person does not perform 
appropriately, the work center always, always [repeats] has the 
means to challenge this and demand that he be removed. It is 
necessary that where the absurdities exist, where there is 
profiteering and two-handed theft... [changes thought] In a 
small work center particularly, where theft keeps everyone on 
the verge of barely making it, everyone knows who the thieves 
are. The manager must be the first to know, and if he is not 
capable of figuring it out, then he does not deserve to be the 
manager. 
  [Cruz] You have made reference to this many times in the 
past 
few days. There is the question of what role the unions must 
play in this situation. What is happening? We have lived for 35 
years in a world where the Revolution is all of us and each of 
us. However, not everyone's functions have been clearly 
established during this process. Yet, the society has made 
progress through diverse means. Nowadays, we have a majority of 
good revolutionary people, but this crisis has also exposed the 
spiritual poverty of many. The difficulties of the people 
require a precise, appropriate balance. I believe it is time for 
the union.... [changes thought] As you mentioned, where there is 
a problem, the workers are fully entitled to express themselves. 
  [Pantoja] I have here a question by Jesus Fernandez Beltran, 
Consulado Street 111, Havana City. He asks: Does the upgrading 
of an enterprise's category increase the salary of the cadres, 
but not of the workers? Is there any official word on this? Can 
this be done now? 
  [Ross] There are certain entities where salary increases for 
workers and managers have been implemented; particularly, for 
workers. There was a major salary increase throughout the 
tourism sector. In joint enterprises, the personnel rosters have 
been adjusted. More is therefore required of the workers in 
terms of workload, as well as in level of professionalism. We 
have stated that as more is demanded of the worker, there must 
also be a salary response. The life of the nation does not stop 
when confronted with a situation such as this. While we are 
correcting things over here, we are also making progress on the 
other side, where we can. We must accelerate progress there 
where it is needed. 
  I do not know what specific case he is referring to. The 
goal 
now is to adjust, to free the economy and services from the 
heavy ballast of bloated personnel rosters, in the production 
sector as well as in administration. This cannot be done 
hastily. It must be studied. We must clearly explain the entire 
rationalization process. I answered a question on the Open 
Agenda program, that this must be accompanied by active union 
participaton. This will always be done with individuals in mind: 
those staying and those who must relocate, particularly those 
who must relocate because they are the ones who face the 
greatest conflict. 
  [Cruz] I am concerned by something that I know also worries 
many people, because I have discussed this with friends and 
listeners. I am very afraid that under this premise of 
protecting the workers and the people, we will continue 
promoting paternalism. This worries me a great deal because I 
already know many cunning people who are saying: "I can bypass 
that; no problem." This worries me because I believe that we 
have to at least once, in this society, ensure that good things 
are for those who really work and contribute to society. This is 
why I support helping people rather than subsidizing products 
and activities. This is why I believe people should be 
subsidized. If your income is very low and you have to do 
certain things, you can be given a special card. This is done in 
all countries of the world, even the capitalist countries. You 
pay less for transportation and so forth, but the other prices 
are high. There are many who think that because our people are 
so fine, the Revolution so good, that those who do not work, who 
do not make an effort to get a job, will continue to live off 
those who do. 
  [Ross] Soledad, it is going to be very difficult to ignore 
our humanitarian, paternalistic nature. What we can do is ensure 
social justice. In a TRABAJADORES editorial we said that our 
commitment is to the good worker, the worker who does his job, 
the worker who fulfills his social duties. We have no commitment 
to slackers. I therefore believe that what you say is fair. The 
good workers and the people do not believe that the Revolution 
will abandon anyone. But we must remember that the Revolution is 
the people, the people who work, the patriotic people. 
  [Cruz] I have here three questions that have to do with the 
state. Perhaps you have questions as well. 
  [Pantoja] Similar questions and different questions. 
  [Cruz] The people have been somewhat shocked by what they 
heard about the profitability of the enterprises, the budget, 
the budget deficit, the enterprises that contribute to the 
deficit. 
  [Pantoja] Sixty-one percent of the enterprises. 
  [Cruz] That is correct. The people are demanding that the 
state set an example, and I believe the people are right in 
making this demand. The people have asked the following 
question: Will the workers be told how much foreign exchange the 
enterprises use up? 
  [Ross] They must be told. 
  [Cruz] How does the government plan to save money? Has the 
government decided on the measures to be implemented or is it 
waiting for the people to express their opinion? 
  [Ross] No measures have been drafted. All possible measures 
are being studied. Comrade Fidel said quite rightly that no 
matter how good a technical measure may be, if it is not 
understood and supported by the workers, it cannot be 
implemented. On the other hand, the workers themselves are quite 
capable of coming up with ways to solve the problem, ways that 
not even the academicians can think of. 
  I will give you an example and you will see that it is the 
same as one of those suggestions you jotted down in your 
notepad. At the cigar factory, workers suggested that instead of 
giving the worker days off for illness, that ten days a year be 
set aside for sick leave. 
  [Pantoja] Jose Miguel Quinonez Matos of El Vedado has 
suggested 10 days a year. 
  [Ross] That is correct. The workers suggested 10 days. 
During 
the days of capitalism, the worker got nine days sick leave. The 
tobacco workers have suggested 12 days of sick leave a year. 
They also suggested that if a worker does not use up his sick 
leave, he be paid for those days at the end of the year. That is 
a suggestion. I am not saying that it must be implemented, but 
it does sound interesting. I do not think the academics had 
thought about that. 
  [Pantoja] This also gives you an idea of how the workers are 
searching for ways to save, and to put an end to paternalism. 
Many of the workers get medical certificates to cover up many of 
these things. The health congress discussed.... 
  [Ross, interrupts] Soledad was just talking about what La 
Corona workers had suggested. If a person gets sick and is going 
to be out for more than the 10 days, he can take sick leave. 
Then he will be covered by social security. It will be up to the 
social security people to investigate the worker's economic 
situation. His family must also be investigated to determine 
whether they need this help. There are families with only one 
income and there are also families with four, five, six incomes. 
There are people who do not have a single centavo in the bank, 
and there are people who have money in the bank and can cover 
part of their out-patient expenses. 
  [Cruz] Of course. 
  [Ross] That is what the workers suggested. They suggested 
that a sick-leave system be implemented. They suggested even 
more sick leave days than those given in the past. They 
suggested 12 days of sick leave a year. The citizen who wrote in 
suggested.... 
  [Pantoja, interrupts] He suggested 10 days? 
  [Ross] He suggested 10 days. Nothing specific has been 
decided on. However, there are some measures that can be 
implemented at the work centers. These measures can contribute 
to improving production, and that is important. 
  [Cruz] And these measures can be implemented immediately. 
  [Ross] Yes, they can be implemented immediately. There are 
measures to correct the problems we have at the work centers. 
There are measures to better use what little resources we have. 
If there was ever a time when we had to put our resources to 
best use, it is now when we do not have that much. We cannot 
squander. 
  [Cruz] Excuse me, I wish to say something to our listeners. 
Our telephone is ringing, but we are having problems when we 
answer it in the studio; so please call 79-1903. I repeat, the 
telephone line that is working properly is 79-1903. 
  [Pantoja] Pedro, from these TRABAJADORES editorials, the two 
most recent editorials, your statements at the various meetings, 
what I have heard some provincial union leaders say on the 
radio, I gather that the labor union's supervisory role must be 
expanded. The labor union must confront these problems at the 
work centers. The labor union must be given more power, or 
stress the power it has always had and have the union leaders 
use it. 
  [Ross] The labor union must use the power it has. The 
workers must use the power they have to help the country. 
  [Pantoja] Yes. 
  [Ross] To help the country and to help themselves, which is 
the same thing. The interests of the workers and our people are 
at stake. Socialism is at stake. The social progress we have 
made throughout the past 35 years are at stake. We must defend 
this and we must defend this with what we have. 
  [Cruz] I think this experience is very important. It is not 
the first time something like this is being done. For many 
years whenever an important congress was held, whenever a change 
to the Constitution was made it was always discussed with the 
rank and file, with the people. However, I do believe that the 
union and the workers should work hard to ensure that the idea 
of a parliament at the work place is not lost. The workers must 
always feel that they have the right to ask and demand 
explanations of what the administration is doing. This right 
must not be lost. We have returned to what I consider has been 
the backbone of the Cuban revolutionary process. We have 
returned to the days of direct participation of the workers in 
the decision making process. 
  [Ross] The workers are the owners of these enterprises, and 
as owners they must take action. 
  Yesterday in Pinar del Rio a comrade asked: What will 
happen once all this is over? This is not going to end. This 
will continue. This is not a campaign. We are gathering ideas, 
suggestions, proposals. We are talking and explaining, and the 
people are understanding the situation. However, efficiency is 
not something you will achieve from one day to another. 
Efficiency is not something that will be achieved after a 
meeting. We must continue to work at each work center. We have 
production and service meetings that should be used to discuss 
efficiency. This would be very helpful for the country. We 
would help the country by analyzing economic efficiency. We can 
analyze how efficiently the subsidized units use their budgets, 
how the.... 
  [Pantoja, interrupts] The restaurants.... 
  [Ross, interrupts] Efficiency is the services that are 
offered, any kind of service offered by the labor groups. This 
can be discussed on a monthly basis. The workers would have an 
active role at these meetings; they would not be passive 
listeners. The union leaders are responsible for promoting the 
active role of the worker. 
  [Pantoja] The worker lost interest in the production 
assemblies; the idea behind these assemblies was lost. The 
administrations took an offensive stance. The administrators 
were the ones drafting the reports and presiding over the 
assemblies. The union stepped aside. 
  [Ross] Those are reports that say nothing. 
  [Pantoja] Totally technical reports. 
  [Ross] A report is not numbers alone. A report must also be 
a means to evaluate a situation. Where is the problem? Why 
this much, and not more? 
  [Pantoja] Pedro, what has happened is that technical words 
are used to describe technical problems, and we do not have the 
knowledge of the technical aspects of the work. We know nothing 
of productivity, costs, profitability. Now we must learn all 
these things. 
  [Ross] Because of the special period we cannot evade our 
responsibility in discussing these issues. The special period 
forces us to confront that discussion. 
  [Cruz] There is another problem we must broach. The people 
are discouraged when they cannot participate. This is why the 
production and service meetings lost their value. The workers 
felt that they did not have the right to be heard, to demand 
that he be heard. 
  [Pantoja] The problem was that issues were discussed month 
after month and no one did anything to improve the situation. 
  [Ross] You are correct. 
  [Pantoja] People get tired after a while. 
  [Ross] We now have the UBPC. The members of the UBPC are the 
ones who make the decisions. Whatever they say is law. There 
are currently 1 million workers who make up the UBPC's. 
  [Pantoja] I have more questions from our listeners. Ana 
Maria Mendoza Verdor, from San Miguel del Padron, wants to know: 
There is talk that there will be wage cuts. Will the wages of 
the manager or director of an unprofitable enterprise be cut as 
well? 
  [Ross] We do not have to lower the salary of a manager or 
director who is not capable of making his enterprise profitable. 
What we have to do is find a new manager. The solution is not to 
cut his wages. We have to demand efficiency from our managers. 
The manager must work efficiently. They are getting paid for 
that and it is their responsibility. 
  [Cruz] I have a caller on the line. 
  [Unidentified caller] Good morning. I am from Nuevitas 
Municipality, Camaguey Province. I work at the CATM [expansion 
unknown] at Nuevitas port. I am a coordinator with 28 years of 
service and am 52 years old. I would like Pedro Ross to answer a 
question. If there were a reduction here at the port and I was 
affected, what would happen to me if, because of my age and 
years of service, there is no other job for me? I would like to 
know what will happen to people like me? Right? 
  [Ross] You are about ready to retire. It has been said that 
all those workers who are nearing retirement age, who are 
efficient workers, and who have a good work record, will be 
given special consideration if this should occur. However, you 
are calling me from Camaguey. Camaguey is an area where 
manpower is needed. We need more workers at the power company 
in Nuevitas. We need more workers at that important power 
company. Changes have been made at the Nuevitas Port. I do not 
know what kind of a payroll they have there. You are working in 
an area that does not merit cuts; it is in those areas where we 
need more manpower. Once our economy improves we will have more 
work at the ports, and Nuevitas is one of the most important 
ports in the country. You told me that you work for the CATM. 
You are responsible for controlling and distributing the 
merchandise that comes into the country. We would have to study 
the situation there, but I can tell you and we have decided that 
those workers who are nearing retirement age must be respected 
and will have priority as far as remaining in their jobs is 
concerned. 
  [Cruz] Reina Cintras Portal from Sancti Spiritus also had a 
question regarding retirement: Are there any plans for the 
graduating youths and current labor or labor training problems, 
and are there plans to reduce the age for retirement? 
  [Ross] This is something that has existed for a long time. 
  [Cruz] This has been around for a while. 
  [Ross] Since we began to prepare for the 16th [CTC] 
Congress, 
this issue was discussed intensely, even in sectors such as 
education. In the next 25 years Cuba will see a drop in the 
growth of the active labor force due to birth rates, the 
demographic process we face in the next 25 years. In countries 
were life expectancy is being extended and people over 60 are 
physically strong and useful, active labor time is extended 
because that worker is an important resource for the country. 
We, Cuba, cannot adopt a measure in this regard on the basis of 
the situation we are trying to overcome. This is temporary. The 
less it lasts the better. We are going to need that work force. 
It is possible that in the future we might have to raise the 
retirement age, as is done in the developed countries where life 
expectancy is long. We have 1.1 million retirees in Cuba. Cuba 
paid 1.6 billion in social security in 1993. In other words, a 
fourth of what is paid in salaries in Cuba is paid through... 
  [Pantoja interrupting] How much was paid? 
  [Ross] 1.6 billion in retirement benefits and social 
programs. 
  [Cruz] This is an impressive figure for a country like ours 
and the problems we have. 
  We have about five minutes left. I want to remind all that 
on 
17 January there is going to be meeting of the union cadres in 
the CTC provincial school; on 18 January, there is going to be a 
meeting of union cadres at 1500 in the Martinez Prieto 
Agroindustrial Complex; on 19 January in Havana at 0900 and 1600 
in a merchant fleet vessel; on 20 January, the Cuban delegation 
to Latin American and Caribbean events will meet with Ariguanabo 
union cadres at 1300. The Havana UBPC will meet at 0900 on 24 
January in the Finlay Institute; on 25 January, there will be a 
meeting of the CTC Secretariat with union cadres of Havana port. 
The Solidarity with Cuba meeting continues in Batabano Fishing 
Complex on 27 January. On the 28th there will a ceremony to mark 
the 55th anniversary of the CTC at 1500 in the Lazaro Pena 
Theater; on 29 January, there will be a plenum of the CTC 
National Committee; and on 30 January a housing project 
inauguration in the 14 July neighborhood in Cienfuegos. 
  There are activities, discussions, debates scheduled for the 
rest of the month. I believe it has been quite a while since the 
workers have been so excited, because we know we are deciding 
the future of the nation, which is our own future. I believe 
there is a caller. Let us listen to her. 
  [Caller] My name is Mella Costa Vera, a worker in Boca Ciega 
Workers tourist village. In the previous program, Soledad Cruz 
proposed discussing today the issue of incentives for workers. 
Since it was not possible to discuss this issue due to the 
importance of all the issues discussed in the last two programs, 
I would like to propose that Comrade Pedro Ross check his agenda 
and see if he can participate in this program next Saturday [22 
January] to continue discussing these issues due to their 
importance for the country and the value of his explanations. 
This would clarify all the doubts we workers have when it comes 
time to make proposals. That is all I wanted to suggest. 
  [Ross] Well, since this program is early in the morning I 
can 
come. 
  [Cruz] I am truly glad about this caller's suggestion 
because 
there are many things to discuss and calls. We have a call from 
Eulalia Ginarche Miranda from Baguanos Municipality in Holguin. 
There are other questions by Reina [words indistinct]. There are 
other aspects to discuss of the letter from Ines Pacheco. 
  [Pantoja] We have about four or five more question left and 
there is time for more until Saturday. 
  [Cruz] There are issues such as personnel rosters which 
highly worry the workers. Will retirees and non-union workers, 
as well as housewives, get a chance to give their opinions? This 
is another interesting issue. There are many complaints from 
retirees that the country is not counting them, their 
experience, or help. I have many complaints from retirees. We 
will have to see if we create a retirees movement to also 
contribute to the work centers. How can we tell about ill-gotten 
money? Well, there are many issues. 
  I am glad you have shown so much interest in these open 
dialogues. Continue calling during the week the numbers 7-4587 
and 79-1903 from 1000 to 1200. See you next Saturday. Have a 
good weekend and do not forget to participate in the meetings in 
your work places.

  [Text] At the assembly process called Parliament in the 
Work Place, the first thing every work center should discuss is 
how to become more efficient, for the fate of the Revolution and 
of the Cuban people is at stake. Thus said Francisco Duran 
Harvey, member of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] national 
secretariat, in a speech at a meeting with Granma Province's 
main union cadres on the possible measures to be implemented in 
order to streamline Cuba's internal finances. 
  Duran stressed that this is a process of great importance 
and 
political significance that requires us to close ranks without 
first requiring all workers to think the same way; and it is 
necessary for union cadres to be prepared with convincing 
arguments and views. 
  [Begin Duran recording] Therefore, this is not just one more 
battle. At the National Assembly, Fidel insisted strongly that 
we had to get the measures implemented once we got the workers 
to understand. He said we could not win that battle without the 
workers. He said it clearly, very clearly. Therefore, all of us 
have to engage in this battle, and we have to work intelligently 
to win it. Because even after applying the measures, we will not 
have solved the problems. The measures are just a one path 
toward the solution. And it was said very clearly here that the 
problems of efficiency and fulfillment of our basic economic 
objectives play a decisive role. And, like people say, we must 
encourage people to make suggestions, encourage people to make 
recommendations. 
  At the assembly the other day in La Corona, there were 
workers who stated that work discipline has deteriorated but 
that one cannot speak of a generalized deterioration as there 
was no deterioration of discipline in repairing the mills, 
because the people made an extraordinary effort. We have a great 
tendency to generalize concepts. We must talk about whether 
there is deterioration in work discipline, but we cannot talk 
about this in a general manner. We must get down to particulars. 
And when I am in a work group, I have to speak, express myself 
graphically, and then there will be no problems. [end recording] 
  You have just heard Francisco Duran Harvey, member of the 
CTC 
national secretariat, who made these statements in the city of 
Bayamo regarding the assembly process entitled Parliament in Our 
Work Place, which is aimed at having the workers reflect on 
implementing measures to streamline our internal finances.

<F P=106> [Report by Francisco Ramirez Cardenas] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 14 Jan (NOTIMEX) [dateline as received) -- 
The Cuban Government has affirmed that in 1994 there will be a 
solution to the current economic crisis overwhelming the country 
and expressed its hopes for a reactivation of a greater 
sugarcane harvest. 
  Politburo members of the ruling Communist Party of Cuba 
(PCC) 
have felt the recession will bottom out in the middle of the 
year, but they urged the people to work more efficiently and 
save the scant available resources. 
  "Cuba has the perspective of recovery, and the current and 
next sugarcane harvests will be decisive in this endeavor," 
Carlos Lage, Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers 
secretary, has stated during a meeting with leaders of the sugar 
sector. According to the strategy of the current economic 
reforms, only the sugarcane harvest will provide the necessary 
resources to come out of the "special period in peacetime," as 
the crisis and the measures to alleviate it are called. 
  During the past season of its main industry, Cuba registered 
the lowest production in three decades (4.2 million tons), 
something President Fidel Castro has publicly called a disaster. 
According to Lage, the 1994 to 1995 harvest will be greater 
than this year's. Castro estimated in late December that the 
current harvest will be a few hundred tons greater than the 1992 
to 1993 harvest. 
  Since the disappearance of the Socialist Bloc and the Soviet 
Union earlier this decade, Cuba has been going through a 
profound crisis, with shortages of food, fuel, medicine, 
transportation, and other basic consumer goods. Havana has 
blamed the heightened U.S. economic and commercial embargo as 
the other cause of its woes. 
  The last session of the National Assembly has indicated that 
the surplus of money in circulation--estimated at more than 12 
billion pesos--and the budget deficit of approximately 4.2 
billion pesos constitute the two crucial problems to be resolved 
immediately. In government books, the Cuban peso is at par with 
the U.S. dollar, but in the flourishing black market the dollar 
sells from between 70 to 80 pesos. The surplus of money in 
circulation has led to a greater drop in efficiency, 
productivity, discipline, and interest in work. 
  According to an official report, during 1993 almost 40 
percent of the disciplinary measures applied against workers 
were prompted by unjustified absences and an interruption of 
working hours, something that has been compounded by 
"negligence, disobedience, and borderline criminal conducts." 
With the state coffers almost without hard currency, without 
international sources of credit, the alarming government 
statistics also show that only 31 percent of the state 
enterprises are profitable. 
  "During the second half a favorable change must be 
noticeable 
in the improvement of internal finances," and the amount of fuel 
will be greater, Politburo member Jorge Lezcano has stated. 
Cuba will exchange 1.5 million tons of sugar for 4 million tons 
of oil, according to an agreement signed with Russia. Lezcano 
has said there are greater possibilities of moving ahead in 
1994, although he admitted that in essence the same economic 
programs of 1993 will be maintained. These programs caused a 
deterioration in the people's lives. 
  Meanwhile, the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) is apparently 
going to claim the responsibility for the new economic 
adjustment measures that have a high social cost, which the 
assembly will adopt to improve internal finances. The CTC is 
holding meetings at labor centers where speakers have suggested 
actions to reactive the shaky economy. 
  The sale of "bonds for the fatherland" (without interest), 
ceasing gratuities and subsidies, taxes, higher electricity 
rates, and the confiscation of wealth obtained "in an illicit 
manner" are some of the proposals. Economists say the true 
solution to the money surplus in the hands of the people is to 
increase production and offer industrial, farming, and service 
goods. 
  "This process of consultation will make it possible to bring 
a consensus to the next meeting of the National Assembly," CTC 
Secretary General Pedro Ross has said on state-owned television. 
Analysts feel the government expects that out of these meetings 
will come the major guidelines of the adjustment program, which 
includes a reduction of the bloated state apparatus and 
inevitable quota of greater unemployment. 
  Government officials recognize the priority of some of the 
proposals but say the achievements of the Cuban socialist 
system, such as in the health field and free education, will be 
maintained at any rate. The new measures will give continuity 
to the reform package begun in August 1993 by the government 
passing a law that will allow the free circulation of foreign 
currency, allowing self- employment and creating cooperatives 
for inefficient state farming.

  [Text] Important aspects of the economic situation of 
Matanzas Province were debated in its workers parliament. The 
event was attended by Pedro Ross, secretary general of the Cuban 
Workers Federation, and Ricardo Alarcon, president of the 
National Assembly of the People's Government. 
  Union leaders, deputies, and delegates to the People's 
Government in the province held an intense debate on the 
economic problems being confronted and the possible solutions. 
It was stressed that the most important thing is to seek 
efficiency at each work place and labor post. The meeting, held 
prior to the beginning of the process in the work centers, was 
presided over by Politburo members Ricardo Alarcon and Pedro 
Ross. 
  It was stated that Matanzas Province has a budget deficit of 
120 million pesos and that 11 local enterprises received 
subsidies totaling 213 million pesos during 1993. The money in 
circulation totals 1.12 billion pesos, which is equivalent to 
the salary of 20 months. Confronting these problems demands 
intelligence, creativity, and, above all, work. 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] In the meetings in which we have 
participated so far, we have seen clearly how the workers are 
capable of identifying in each place how costs can be reduced, 
and how to increase production and economic efficiency. This is 
how the entire nation, everyone, everywhere, pulling together, 
confronts and ought to truly confront the situation we are 
currently facing. 
  I believe that this is how we all truly participate in the 
parliamentary process. [end recording]

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 
Havana radio and television in Spanish between 12 and 15 January. 
  Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 12 January reports Cubana Airline 
President Heriberto Prieto Musa's statement that Cubana 
transports 40 percent of the tourists coming into Cuba. Prieto 
adds that over 450,000 tourists were served in 1993. Ninety-five 
flights a week by 29 foreign airlines arrive in Cuba. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 13 January reports that over 
800,000 crates of fresh grapefruit have been exported during the 
current grapefruit harvest on the Isle of Youth. 
  Radio Reloj at 1505 GMT on 13 January notes that Varadero's 
tourist organizations took in $188 million in 1993, a figure 
much higher than 1992, but $12 million less than called for 
under the 1993 plan. 
  Radio Rebelde Network at 1800 GMT on 13 January reports that 
"the ecumenical council today presented the official certificate 
of a donation of two biological laboratories to the Roberto 
Fernandez and Sexto Congreso agricultural-livestock production 
cooperatives in Matanzas Province. The agricultural laboratories 
cost over 200,000 pesos." 
  Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 14 January carries the following 
reports: 
  Light Industry Establishment No. 122 in Pinar del Rio plans 
to deliver 1 million meters of fabric covers to the province's 
tobacco plantations on 20 January. Other Pinar del Rio 
textile-industry centers have guaranteed three fourths of the 3 
million meters the province needs. This work began on 8 
December. Over 400,000 meters of textile have already been 
produced, with 40,000 meters being produced daily. Establishment 
No. 122 usually makes military cloaks, backpacks, and other such 
articles. 
  The Third International Caribbean Fair will be held on 28 
June in Santiago de Cuba during the Second Businessmen's 
Meeting, which is part of the effort to incorporate Cuba into 
the world market. This meeting will also encourage business and 
economic partnerships. Installing the organizing committee, 
Cuban Chamber of Commerce President Carlos Martinez Salsamendi 
stressed that the goal is to strengthen trade ties with other 
countries. 
  A third of the near 4,000 tons of metallic and aluminum 
structures produced last year by the Paco Cabrera Enterprise in 
Las Tunas Province have been sold for hard currency under the 
system for self-financing established by that enterprise. The 
products were earmarked mainly for nickel installations in Moa 
and projects of the Cubanacan and (Simex) corporations, as well 
as other organizations and agencies that operate in hard 
currency. 
  A group of businessmen from the Canary Islands is on a work 
visit to Sancti Spiritus Province. The visitors made a donation 
of assorted articles to Cabaiguan Municipality. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 14 January reports that Albert 
Fleming, governor of St. Martin, met with children from the 
Presencia de Lenin school for children without parents, to whom 
he made a donation of clothing and school supplies. Fleming said 
this was the beginning of an important link between the two 
islands. The school is located in Playa Municipality, Havana 
City Province. "He was also very affectionate and caring with 
the children, staying longer than protocol had scheduled." 
Fleming also announced that children from St. Martin would soon 
be visiting Cuba, and Cuban children would visit St. Martin. 
Present at the ceremony were Comrade Jesus Montane, assistant to 
the commander in chief; Havana People's Government leaders, and 
other members of the governor's delegation. 
  Rebelde also reports that Mexico donated 120 specialized 
books to the University of Havana on 14 January. On 19 January, 
Mexico will donate school notebooks to the children of Cuba. 
  Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 15 January reports that the (Sagnav 
I) 
Enterprise in Santa Clara manufactured over 3.04 million bags in 
1993. The bags were earmarked for the sugar industry and for use 
in rice production. 
  In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that Holguin's basic 
electric power organization repaired "close to 400" transformers 
in 1993, thereby reducing the need for imports and saving the 
nation over $120,000. 
  Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 15 January reports the following: 
  "While in 1989, the excess currency in circulation in Cuba 
was 4.163 billion pesos, there is today over 10 billion pesos of 
excess currency circulating, and it is believed that figure is 
going to continue to increase." 
  (Luo Hung), a PRC Embassy officer in Cuba, in a message of 
greeting over local radio on the Isle of Pines, highlighted the 
ties of friendship that unite the Chinese and Cuban people, and 
donated books and pamphlets the municipal library. 
  "The National Water Resources Institute considers the 
preservation of the patrimony accumulated by the Revolution, 
enterprises, and the irrigation system a priority task for 
1994." In 1958, the nation's reservoirs could hold only 46 
million cubic meters; they can today hold 9 billion cubic 
meters. Cuba today has 218 dams, thousands of km of canals, and 
a great number of costly pieces of equipment. It is also 
building several aqueducts, one of which -- the Santiago de Cuba 
aqueduct, currently under construction -- will have cost, when 
completed, $40 million pesos. 
  Radio Havana Cuba at 0000 GMT on 15 January reports the 
following: 
  Enrique Correa, minister secretary general of the Chilean 
Government, announced that the State Bank of Chile has granted 
its Cuban counterpart a special loan of almost $10 million for 
the purchase of foodstuffs. The minister said that the loan was 
approved by Chilean President Patricio Aylwin and is part of the 
economic opening policy between Cuba and Chile. According to 
Correa, this will allow other banks to follow Chilean investors 
and businesses which already have serious trade ties with Cuba.

  [Text] Dr. Conception Campa, director of the Finlay 
Institute, has announced that this afternoon Cuban authorities 
received the document authorizing Cuba to freely market its 
meningococcal meningitis vaccine in Argentina. 
  [Begin recording] As you all know, this has been a long 
struggle which has taken many complex turns in terms of its 
approval or rejection. There was great pressure exerted by the 
Argentine people, by pediatricians, and by mothers who wanted to 
vaccinate their children. 
  Up to now, no permit had been issued to register the 
vaccine; 
therefore, there was no permit to sell it or to let the people 
buy it. This is what the great news we received a few minutes 
ago is about. I received a call telling me that we already have 
the registration in our hands. This opens the doors to freely 
market the vaccine and for the mothers to buy it and vaccinate 
their children, for the pediatricians to recommend it. 
  Up to now we were not able to do this. This represent an 
important step to protect those children who are in the midst of 
a full blown epidemic and who were not allowed to get the 
vaccine. This is also something very important for us: To be 
able to sell a product which offers no risks and has extremely 
high potential to fight that epidemic in Argentine. [end 
recording] 
  Dr. Concepcion Campa received today the 23 October award 
from 
the Federation of Cuban Women, a homage to the Cuban woman who 
gives to science and Cuba the best of her intellect.

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Gili] </F>
  [Text] We have just established telephone contact with Hugo 
Rios, PRENSA LATINA correspondent in Harare, Zimbabwe, where 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has just concluded his 
visit. Hugo Rios spoke to Roberto Robaina only minutes before he 
left that nation on the so-called Dark Continent. 
  Shortly before concluding his three-day visit to Zimbabwe, 
Robaina told Rios that: We are leaving Zimbabwe with more 
motivation to feel a part of Africa. In statements to PRENSA 
LATINA, Robaina said that during those three days, he felt he 
was back in Cuba, adding that the environment is good for the 
strengthening of ties between the two countries. Robaina was bid 
farewell at the Harare airport by Zimbabwean Foreign Minister 
Nathan Shamuyarira with whom he met three times on the last day 
of his official visit to that country. 
  According to Rios' exclusive report for the "Doing Radio" 
newscast, Robaina and Shamuyarira discussed the international 
situation, the two countries' determination to strengthen 
bilateral relations, and reciprocal ties of solidarity and 
friendship were reiterated. Shamuyarira told PRENSA LATINA that 
not only Zimbabwe but all of Africa is indebted to Cuba. The 
Zimbabwean foreign minister had said these same words on the 
occasion of the 35th anniversary of the triumph of the Cuban 
Revolution and reiterated them in his statements to PRENSA 
LATINA. After bidding farewell to Robaina, who has now left for 
Zambia, Shamuyarira said he shared Robaina's feelings of 
happiness about the meeting. 
  During his stay in Zimbabwe, Foreign Minister Robaina also 
met with the higher education, health, interior, agriculture, 
and information ministers, and with the industry and commerce 
deputy minister. Robaina met with the mayor of Harare, with 
Cubans who work in Zimbabwe, and with the board of directors of 
the Zimbabwe-Cuba Friendship Association. 
  During this morning's telephone conversation with Hugo Rios, 
we also learned that Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce Minister 
Christopher Ushewokunze was killed in a car accident last night. 
The government has reported that the minister was on the road 
that links Harare to (Balaguayo), in southern Zimbabwe, when he 
crashed into a military vehicle.

  [Text] It has been officially announced in Santo Domingo 
that Cuba has become a full member of the Caribbean Hotel 
Association by unanimous vote of the members of the executive 
committee of this body. The announcement was made on 17 January 
by (Bel Hoberman), a representative of the association, during 
the Market Place-94 event being held in the Jaragua Hotel with 
the participation of over 1,000 delegates and travel agents from 
Central America and the Caribbean. 
  Caribbean tourism officials believe Cuba's entry into the 
association is extremely important in light of the significant 
growth Cuba has experienced in this sector in the last few years 
and its potential. For years Cuba sought to become a member of 
the Caribbean Hotel Association headquartered in Puerto Rico.

  [Text] On 15 January, Army General Raul Castro Ruz toured 
Cienfuegos Province, where he held a unique meeting without a 
set agenda or formal head table. Several political issues of 
great importance were deeply debated. 
  Manuel Menendez Castellanos, first secretary of the 
Communist 
Party of Cuba [PCC] in the province, presented an in-depth 
briefing on the firm support being given to the Revolution by 
the masses in the province whom are exercising admirable 
selfnessness and using creative initiatives to confront the 
harsh conditions of the special period. Menendez spoke of the 
sustained progress made in the food program, although he 
described the progress as inadequate. He stressed the efforts 
being made to increase production and the recent work to ensure 
that cadres of the PCC, People's Government, and organizations 
can deftly conduct economic analyses and act with energy to 
reduce costs and increase productivity and production. 
  Menendez pointed out that this strategy is essential to 
attain the economic efficiency that will make possible to step 
by step reduce state subsidies and repair domestic finances. 
  Raul praised the efforts and work of the people of 
Cienfuegos, and insisted on several key points to attain goals 
in the farming sector, goals such as discipline, planning, and 
organization of the workers. This is to ensure effective work 
shifts of never less than eight hours a day. He also insisted on 
using 90 percent of the work force and fuel on the furrow 
irrigation, and the minimum amount of tractors to work the land, 
as well as to amply use ox teams in every possible phase of the 
agrarian process. 
  In relation to the positive experiences of the Youth Labor 
Army [EJT], Raul stated that these principles are valid for 
state farms as well as for the Basic Cooperative Production 
Units [UBPC] being created [words indistinct]. In every case, 
the worker's income should reflect the end result of his work. 
  The fight against crime and social indiscipline was another 
issue discussed. Colonel Luis Barrera, provincial representative 
of the Interior Ministry [Minint], briefed Raul on this issue. 
He described the efforts as generally favorable. However, there 
is need to maintain and increase vigilance and control measures, 
improve the Unified Vigilance and Protection System and broaden 
even more the people's participation in this struggle. 
  Menendez referred to the mobilization of PCC and Union of 
Young Communists members and base-level bodies in the fight 
against crime and the effective intervention of the task action 
brigades in necessary cases. 
  Raul insisted that this is a struggle of the entire people, 
not only the police's and the Minint's. He also stressed that 
every leader, from the minister to the manager of a small 
warehouse, must be fully responsible to preserve the people's 
resources under his responsibility and act accordingly. Raul 
added that quicker action by judicial bodies is needed to 
respond to the changing mode of operations by the criminals. 
  In the company of Division Generals Leopoldo Cintra Frias 
and 
Joaquin Quintas Solas, chief of the Western and Central Armies, 
respectively, Raul visited a tourist facility and the Carlos 
Manuel de Cespedes electric plant. In the Punta Las Cuevas 
Hotel, manager Santiago Manzano explained to Raul that this a 
recently inaugurated center primarily for vanguard workers and 
couples on their honeymoons. Raul stressed the importance of 
preserving these types of services and urged its workers to 
maintain the quality which, despite its short time in operation, 
already distinguishes this hotel. 
  At the electric plant, Raul was interested in the efforts of 
workers and technicians who guarantee the high degree of 
efficiency which characterizes this plant -- a national vanguard 
for 15 consecutive years. He was told that between what is 
produced in the enterprise and what is done in cooperation with 
other local entities, more than 30 percent of essential parts 
and components are being procured and there is the possibility 
of attaining up to 80 percent. Raul asked about the conditions 
of the workers' dining room and housing. He urged keeping in 
mind essential needs and warmly praised this work center. 
  The workers asked Raul to rely a message to Castro regarding 
their willingness to maintain with the available resources the 
operation of this center due to its importance for the country 
in terms of energy and efficiency.

  [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 13 Jan, CANA -- The main 
opposition People's National Congress (PNC) has criticised the 
government's acceptance of funds from foreign investors to 
underwrite a presidential tour of Asia. 
  "These financiers have substantal investment in Guyana and 
are known to be negotiating further investment with the 
government," the party said. It accused the government of 
"compromising their ability to best serve the interests of the 
country." 
  The opposition Working People's Alliance (WPA) and the 
Guyanese Organisation of Indigenous Peoples (GOIP) earlier said 
it was inappropriate that South Korean and Malaysian investors 
in the Barama Company Limited should underwrite part of the cost 
of President Cheddi Jagan's near month-long tour of China, 
Malaysia, Singapore and India which ended January 1. 
  At a press conference last Friday, Jagan admitted the 
financing received through Barama to augment limited public 
funds, but said he was unable to say at the time the amount of 
the funds from the Barama investors. 
  Barama officials here have referred queries about the extent 
of the financing to the government. 
  Barama, a manufacturer of plywood for export, has been 
touched by controversy over the level of concessions it received 
from the former Desmond Hoyte administration, and the impact of 
its forestry operations on the environment and on hinterland 
Amerindian communities here. 
  The Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) also commented, 
indirectly, on the matter in a statement Tuesday expressing 
concern that linkages with the newly-industrialised Asian 
economies opened Guyana to an "aggressive form of exploitation." 
  "It requires no great leap to imagine several powerful Asian 
conglomerates ensuring domestic legislation protects their 
interests when one, Barama Company Ltd, is so profoundly 
influencing foreign policy," the GHRA statement said. 
  Former Prime Minister Hamilton Green, at a press conference 
Wednesday, described the financing of the presidential tour as 
"unorthodox and inappropriate funding by a private group."

  [Text] Mexico City, 15 Jan (EFE) -- The Authentic Party of 
the Mexican Revolution (PARM) today nominated Alvaro Perez 
Trevino as its presidential candidate for the 21 August federal 
election. 
  Perez Trevino has been municipal president of Ciudad Acuna, 
Coahuila, a federal deputy and a leader of the Chamber of 
Deputies in that state. He is an agronomist who graduated from 
the University of Texas at Austin. The PARM candidate is a 
nephew of General Jacinto Blas Trevino, the founder of the 
political organization. Gen. Trevino left the ranks of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the 1950's due to 
differences of opinion with the party's leadership to found a 
new organization. 
  With the nomination of Perez Trevino, each of the nine 
officially registered parties now have their own presidential 
candidate with whom to go out on the campaign trail in search of 
votes. At the same time, the announcement also put an end to 
the intentions of several parties to run for the Mexican 
presidency with a common candidate. 
  The other presidential candidates are: Luis Donaldo Colosio 
of the PRI; Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, of the National Action 
Party; Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano of the Party of the 
Democratic Revolution; Cecilia Soto of the Labor Party; Marcela 
Lombardo Otero of the Popular Socialist Party; Rafael Aguilar 
Talamantes of the Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction 
Party; Pablo Emilio Madero of the National Opposition Union; and 
Jorge Gonzalez Torres, for the Mexican Green Ecologist Party. 
  A group of parties formed a coalition known as the National 
Democratic Front in 1988, which nominated Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 
Solorzano. This, in turn, made that year's elections the most 
criticized in recent decades. Election legislation reforms made 
it extremely difficult to create coalitions among political 
parties, consequently, each party was forced to select their own 
candidate for 1994.

  [Text] The Federal Electoral Tribunal has unanimously 
annulled the resolution approved by the General Council of the 
Federal Electoral Institute [IFE] on 23 December 1993. This 
resolution approved the procedure to determine the ceiling for 
presidential campaign spending. The IFE General Council had 
appointed three of its magistrates to establish the amount that 
would constitute the ceiling for presidential campaign spending. 
  The Federal Electoral Tribunal, however, decided that this 
procedure transfers the IFE General Council's decisionmaking 
power to the magistrates. Therefore, the Federal Electoral 
Tribunal, as explained by its president Jose Luis de la Peza, 
decided that the IFE General Council should issue a new 
resolution before 31 January. 
  [Begin de la Peza recording, in progress] ...by which it can 
determine the ceiling for the amount of money parties can spend 
on their campaigns for the presidential elections. [end 
recording] 
  In turn, the Federal Electoral Tribunal issued a resolution 
that took into account a suit filed against the IFE by the Party 
of the Democratic Revolution.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 18 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item. 
  The Fisheries Secretariat announced that shrimp fishing 
produced $239 million during 1993, which is $34 million more 
than in 1992. Shrimp and other sea products, such as squid, 
seaweed, tuna, and lobster totalled 112,000 tons, for a total 
income of $412 million. The main export market was the United 
States. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1520 GMT 12 Jan 94) 
  Francisco Rojas, director of Mexican Petroleum, Pemex, 
stated 
on 12 January that there are sufficient supplies of petroleum 
products to meet long term demands. Rojas, while announcing 
Pemex plans for 1994, stated that the oil industry remains 
independent of any political trend. He reported that 
investments will total 10.789 billion new pesos, 9.2-percent 
higher than 1993. Half will be used in drilling and exploration 
and the other half will be used in refining activities. The 
average production level will remain at 2.7 million barrels per 
day. Approximately 50 percent will be destined for domestic 
consumption and the rest for export. Pemex Refining Director 
Fernando Manzanillo announced that distribution terminal 
relocation work will continue this year and will include opening 
privately run terminals at Aguascalientes, Zacatecas, and Baja 
California. The major terminal at Guadalajara will be ready in 
August. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 2030 GMT 
12 Jan 94) 
  The Finance Secretariat reported that the trade balance 
deficit dropped 26.4 percent from November 1992 to November 
1993. Mexico, the report states, still purchased more than it 
sold and has a $1 billion deficit. (Mexico City XEW Television 
Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 15 Jan 94) 
  Pemex announced on 15 January that as of 16 January 
industrial fuel oil export prices will increase. Prices will 
vary depending on the refinery and distribution port. Cadereyta 
Refinery in Nuevo Leon lists 151.03 new pesos per cubic meter; 
Madero, Tamaulipas, lists 142.01 new pesos; and Minatitlan, 
Veracruz, lists 162.39 new pesos. In Salamanca, Guanajuato, the 
price will rise to 184.01 new pesos; in Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, it 
will rise to 159.01 new pesos; and in Tula, Hidalgo, to 184.01 
new pesos per cubic meter. 
  The announcement states that prices at the loading ports 
will 
also rise. In Lerma, Campeche, the new price will be 218.37 new 
pesos per cubic meter; in Guaymas, Sonora, it will be 187.62 new 
pesos; and in Lazaro Cardenas, Michoacan, the price will rise to 
177.03 new pesos. At the port in La Paz, Baja California, the 
price will now be set at 188.95 new pesos; in Manzanillo, 
Colima, it will be 179.82 new pesos; in Mazatlan, Sinaloa, 
185.12 new pesos; in Rosarito, Baja California Norte, 194.56 new 
pesos; in Topolobampo, Sinaloa, 184.46 new pesos; and in 
Veracruz it will be set at 176.31 new pesos per cubic meter. 
  Pemex authorities stated that the price adjustments respond 
to the recent international market price evolution process and 
rising distribution and processing costs. (Mexico City NOTIMEX 
in Spanish 0034 GMT 16 Jan 94)

  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has postponed 
for an indefinite period his state visit to Spain due to the 
conflict in Chiapas State. The presidential trip was scheduled 
for the end of the month and was in response to the visit that 
King Juan Carlos paid to Mexico in January 1990. Spanish 
Government spokesmen indicated that the governments of the two 
countries are going to decide on a new date for the visit.

<F P=106> ["Reply" to the EZLN by Manuel Camacho Solis, Mexican </F>
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, in San 
Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, on 18 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] To the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] 
Command: 
  I received your communique. I reply to the points in your 
message and at the same time I present to you the guidelines of 
my actions to facilitate the process of peace and reconciliation. 
  1. The dynamics of war changes are such that had we not 
acted without wasting a single hour in favor of peace, we would 
have entered an irreversible process that would have had very 
serious historical consequences for the Mexican people. 
Precisely because I understand the difficulties in 
communication, my replies have not been conditioned to your 
replies. The unilateral cease-fire and the amnesty law bill 
show the government's willingness to find a political solution. 
I understand that the cease-fire from your side and your desire 
to participate in dialogue are aimed at finding a political 
solution. Citizens and political forces throughout the country 
are demanding a political, humanitarian, socially oriented 
solution that will guarantee peace and reconciliation. 
  2. I have made it clear publicly that Samuel Ruiz Garcia, 
bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, is undoubtedly a citizen, 
who with his pastoral duties, has demonstrated his commitment to 
peace. He is a trustworthy mediator, therefore, I reiterate 
that, for this commissioner, the messages sent to us through him 
are recognized as authentic. 
  Since the positions and the methods used are antagonistic 
and 
since we do not want to get involved in situations that could 
increase our differences, we have been acting within a 
negotiation strategy of messages of harmony, with facts, that 
could facilitate the political solution of the conflict. 
Following a study of the Chiapas situation, of the recognition 
of the need for changes, after observing the serious 
consequences of violence, and after considering the seriousness 
of the violence if it continued, I have come to believe that the 
search for peace requires three phases and a negotiation 
environment: 
  1. The suspension of all attacks, the establishment of a 
dialogue with the EZLN through reliable paths, that this 
commissioner refer to you by your name, and seek to guide public 
opinion toward the construction of peace, and through a dialogue 
establish specific guarantees for you in the amnesty process. 
  2. That the unity of the residents of Chiapas facilitate 
political unity, adherence to government action, immediate 
changes in the application of justice, and serious social 
response to the problems of the Indian communities. 
  3. Once conditions for pacification exist and political 
changes for justice and social programs in Chiapas are under 
way, Mexican society as a whole and national political forces -- 
without pressure of the armed struggle and through the political 
and legal process -- can reflect upon what happened and agree on 
policies and changes to improve the atmosphere of general 
political coexistence. If instead of a negotiation in peace 
followed by deeds in favor of Chiapas unity for security, 
justice, and democracy, we would have waited or wished to 
resolve a global agenda amidst violence, today violence would 
continue with irreversible consequences for public liberties, 
economic stability, and the possibility to carry out the changes 
needed in Chiapas. 
  3. [Number as heard] Regarding your representativeness and 
the treatment that would facilitate communications with you, as 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, I answer 
this concern. Just as we have spoken about negotiation through 
messages with deeds, this response is aimed at the basic point 
of your proposal. In one communique, you requested recognition 
as a belligerent army. In another communique, you proposed that 
only Mexicans by birth participate in the mediation so that the 
conflict can be resolved only by Mexicans. That is why, to 
reconcile your political decision to obtain representativeness 
and not have foreign interference in this conflict, and to 
conduct the negotiation process within the framework of our law, 
I have addressed you as the EZLN, respecting the denomination 
that has given you identity. 
  4. Finally, you asked me what is my duty and my position. 
My duty, as commissioner for peace and reconciliation in 
Chiapas, is to create room for communication and negotiation to 
solve the conflict by political means. I honestly report to the 
Government of Mexico, society, and public so that an objective 
and more practical communication, without subjectivity, can be 
initiated. I am in touch with broad forces of society to gather 
their feelings, and in my proposals, I include what I deem are 
the basic positions of the Government of Mexico and sectors of 
society, on which the economic and political stability of the 
country rests. 
  Regarding the EZLN, I have done everything that is possible 
to stop the war and open paths for peace. Although I am totally 
opposed to your methods, I try to listen to your reasons and try 
to open paths that offer security to all, and in due time, 
possibilities for legal political participation for your 
organization. Regarding my personal political position, I have 
come to this land willing to seek a political solution to the 
conflict. I did it when violence was on the rise; I did it 
because I believe in the superior value of peace and the need 
for reconciliation. Like Benito Juarez, I believe that the best 
way to give vigor to the fatherland is by strengthening the 
Republic with free citizens, democratic institutions, just 
government, and adherence by all to the law. 
  Mexico and the world have listened to your reports of 
abuses, 
discrimination, injustice against Indians and peasants. There 
has also been a general rejection against violence. All 
political forces in the country are in favor of peace. On 
behalf of all the families that want peace and reconciliation, 
and aware of the complexity of the problem and solutions, I 
honestly tell you that this is the appropriate time to reach the 
best results. This is the moment to build a political solution. 
Many things can be achieved with the mobilization of society in 
favor of peace and justice. However, violence today would 
adversely affect society and would further divide the peoples. 
  From San Cristobal de las Casas, 18 January 1994

<F P=106> [From "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] This evening legislators from the political parties 
that make up the permanent commission of the National Congress 
unanimously approved, with 29 members voting in favor of the 
motion, the holding of special sessions at the Chamber of 
Deputies and the Senate. During these special sessions they are 
to review and discuss the amnesty law proposed by President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  Starting on 19 January for three days, special sessions will 
be held at the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate to discuss and 
approve the amnesty bill concerning the violent incidents in the 
Mexican State of Chiapas which was sent to Congress by President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  The amnesty bill contains five articles. Basically the bill 
states that people who violated the law during the violence in 
Chiapas State between 1 January 1994 and 1100 on 16 January will 
not be arrested and prosecuted. The amnesty bill states that 
the attorney general will verify that the law is applied. 
Arrest warrants will be canceled and those being prosecuted 
will be released. The bill also states that in case there are 
any amparos filed regarding these incidents, the authority will 
dismiss charges and will declare the penal action ended. The 
people favored by the amnesty bill may not be arrested or 
prosecuted in the future for the Chiapas incidents. 
  Francisco Jose Paoli, National Action Party deputy, read the 
president's amnesty bill. One of its most important articles 
states: 
  [Begin Paoli recording] The individuals who are currently 
facing judicial action, inside or outside the country, as a 
result of the crimes referred to in Article 1 may benefit from 
the amnesty once they have surrendered all types of weapons, 
explosives, instruments, or other objects used to commit crimes. 
This must be done during the 30-day period following the 
enactment of the law at locations that will be announced at the 
proper time. [end recording] 
  Legislators from the Party of the Democratic Revolution 
demanded the discussion of various constitutional reforms during 
the special sessions to offer more integral solutions to the 
problems faced by the Indians in Chiapas State.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Sarmienta Avilas from the "Vector 21" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] On Wednesday, the legislators who went to Chiapas 
State to collect information on the situation in the state will 
issue a report. The report will be presented to the Permanent 
Commission of Congress and to Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner 
for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. 
  Last week, Camacho Solis said he would go to Congress to 
learn the opinions of the two senators and 11 deputies from the 
six parliamentary benches who recently visited Chiapas to 
analyze the situation there. According to the agenda, the 
Permanent Commission of Congress will meet at 1000. Camacho 
Solis will then be presented with ideas and suggestions on how 
to resolve the Chiapas conflict. 
  Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] Deputy Alejandro 
Encinas, member of the group that traveled to Chiapas, has said 
that the group will propose measures in addition to the amnesty. 
  [Begin Encinas recording] I think the issue, regardless of 
the interests of the private sector, the government, and the 
political parties, is to outline the essentials -- namely, the 
new relationship the state must have with Indian groups, a 
relationship that respects their autonomy and their traditions 
while acknowledging the Indian authorities as formal 
authorities, as well as the way in which the federation is 
integrated. [end recording] 
  At the conclusion of the Permanent Commission's meeting, the 
Chamber of Deputies and Senate will simultaneously convene for a 
special session at 1200 [1800 GMT]. Later, at 1400, lawmakers 
from both chambers will join in a General Congress session to be 
informed of the presidential amnesty initiative for Chiapas.

  [Text] Mexico City, 18 Jan (EFE) -- Chiapas Provisional 
Governor Elmar Setzer presented his resignation to the state 
congress today. A Chiapas government source reported the 
congress has appointed Javier Lopez Moreno to replace him. 
  Setzer was appointed provisional governor in January 1993 
when Governor-elect Patrocinio Gonzalez was designated 
government secretary. 
  Lopez Moreno is the second provisional governor in Chiapas 
and takes Setzer's place as a result of the armed conflict in 
the region.

<F P=106> [Report by Maricarmen Camacho from Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas] </F>
  [Text] This afternoon [18 January], the 58th legislature of 
the Chiapas Congress appointed Javier Lopez Moreno governor of 
Chiapas after Provisional Governor Elmar Setzer resigned. After 
being sworn in as governor, Lopez Moreno announced that the 
state's three branches will be installed as soon as possible in 
Ocosingo in an effort to deal with the institutional crisis in 
the state. The new governor promised to be frank and to deal 
directly with the Chiapas Indians and peasants, and he invited 
the people to confront the crisis with unity, genius, and hard 
work. He said he will hold the post of governor loyally and 
patriotically. 
  [Begin Lopez Moreno recording] I will take office with the 
state's legislative and judicial branches in Ocosingo as soon as 
possible. The new government will begin working in the middle 
of the conflict zone with all of the forces of Chiapas. [end 
recording] 
  The appointment was made by a congressional majority. The 
only vote against Lopez Moreno was cast by PRD [Party of the 
Democratic Revolution] Deputy Demostenes Munoz who, attempting 
to be funny and ironic, voted for Commander Marcos -- the leader 
of the subversive actions in the jungle areas of Chiapas. 
  The new governor is of Indian heritage, and he was born in 
Tenejapa on 19 November 1946. He holds a law degree from the 
Mexican Autonomous University. He served as education and 
culture secretary during the government of retired General 
Absalon Castellanos Dominguez. For several years he was member 
of the PRI's [Institutional Revolutionary Party] National 
Executive Committee, where he held the posts of social action 
secretary, delegate to the Federal Electoral Commission, and 
head of the PRI's National Executive Committee advisers. In 
addition, he served as federal deputy for Chiapas during the 
54th legislature of the Chiapas Congress.

  [Text] San Jose, 13 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- The solid bloc 
maintained by the Latin American banana-producing countries in 
their negotiations with the European Union (EU) has shown its 
first public fissure when four countries in the bloc failed to 
attend today's meeting in Costa Rica to study the European 
import proposal. 
  The meeting, which ends tonight, was called by Costa Rica. 
However, Ecuador, the world's top banana-producing country; 
Panama; Honduras; and Guatemala were not present, and only the 
host country, Colombia, Venezuela, and Nicaragua showed up for 
the meeting. 
  Prior to the meeting, which got under way after an hour's 
delay, Costa Rican Foreign Trade Minister Roberto Rojas said the 
countries that had not attended the meeting "do not agree" on 
presenting a counterproposal to the EU's 14 December offer, 
which is now being studied in San Jose.

  [Text] Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (NA) -- The 
presidents of Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia this morning 
agreed to establish a joint entity that will study possible 
solutions to the problems created by the continual floods of the 
Pilcomayo River. 
  This was announced this morning by Argentine Foreign 
Minister 
Guido Di Tella following the meeting among Presidents Carlos 
Menem, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in the 
Mirador Hotel. 
  Taking the opportunity of the presence of the Bolivian 
president, the Argentine and Paraguayan presidents invited him 
to help them find solutions for the Pilcomayo problems. 
  Di Tella said that these floods cause considerable 
ecological 
damage. He added that in order to solve these problems the three 
countries will seek financing from international financial 
institutions. 
  The Argentine minister said that during 1994 Argentina and 
Paraguay will try to solve the problems created by this river 
exclusively in their countries, but in 1995 the works and 
studies will have to be carried out jointly among the three 
countries. 
  Argentina and Paraguay last year had serious incidents as a 
result of the poor construction of two relief channels on both 
sides of the river in Formosa Province. 
  The issue was solved when the two governments decided to 
leave aside these faulty channels and to begin new works to 
solve the problem of the floods.

<F P=106> [Report by Enelcys Rodriguez Calderon; quotation marks as </F>
published] 
  [Text] "The report Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin 
has presented is not sufficiently clear and explicit enough to 
reach final conclusions" on the actions of crew members of the 
National Guard helicopter, Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa 
Antich has said at Miraflores Palace. 
  The report prepared by the Colombian Government and 
delivered 
12 January by the Colombian foreign minister to President Ramon 
J. Velasquez establishes that the aircraft entered illegally 
Colombian territory, violated international and internal rules 
of states as well as the safety and property of individuals in 
that country. 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister has said he read carefully 
the document and found that it is not sufficiently 
comprehensive. Ochoa Antich has said: "It is said National 
Guard members fired upon the helicopter themselves, because the 
shots were fired from the side, instead of from bottom to top. 
The defense minister made an explanation to me, and I, who also 
have some knowledge in this regard, believe that it may have 
occurred while the helicopter made a turn; therefore, this is 
not enough evidence." 
  Ochoa explained that the Colombian Government has reached 
negative conclusions regarding the actions of the helicopter 
crew members and that the reasoning leading to this hypothesis 
is insufficient." The reason why the report has concluded that 
the members of the patrol fired the shots is because two empty 
cases of a 562 projectile appeared near the place where the 
helicopter was found." 
  For Ochoa, the evidence supplied by Colombia is not 
sufficiently strong or accurate, and he added that the report's 
conclusions were based on statements by residents of the area." 
This leads us to wait for the investigation being conducted by 
the Defense Ministry." He added that the helicopter case does 
not merit issuing a letter of protest. 
  When questioned on whether good conduct was the main 
condition for repatriating Colombian inmates, Ochoa stated 
flatly: "No. The agreement clearly establishes that the 
reasons are very specific; they should be sentenced prisoners 
and must be willing to be sent to the other country." That 
requisite "is not included in the agreements," he concluded.

<F P=106> [Article by Jayme Brener, Luciano Suassuna, and Helio </F>
Contreiras: "Kepi on the Forelock"; introductory paragraph in 
boldface as published] 
  [Text] The military are criticizing the Federal 
Supreme Court, reversing cuts included in the economic package 
(with Itamar's support), and invading the political arena. 
  "If we should be forced to leave our bleached bones on the 
desert trails in vain, beware the wrath of the legions!" That 
simple expression of feeling to a cousin has lifted Centurion 
Marcus Flavinius (a centurion was a kind of second lieutenant in 
ancient Rome) from obscurity and given him a place of honor in 
the most daring operation by the Brazilian military since the 
end of the dictatorship in 1985. In only 36 hours--between 
dinner on Tuesday the 7th and lunch on Thursday the 9th--the 
high command used veiled threats to prevent a 40-percent cut in 
its budget of 21.1 billion cruzeiros (at April prices). The cut 
had been part of Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's economic 
package. In a pincer movement, the military condemned the 
Federal Supreme Court's decision not to strip former President 
Fernando Collor de Mello of his political rights and severely 
criticized the immobilism of the CPI [congressional 
investigating committee], which cannot decide how to punish the 
corrupt deputies. The hardest blow in that operation--an 
operation aimed at occupying space in the confused Brazilian 
political arena--came in a speech by the Army chief of staff, 
General Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel, on Thursday. He 
resurrected Centurion Flavinius and the latter's threats during 
what was supposed to have been a peaceable ceremony for 
presenting commanders' swords to new general officers in 
Brasilia. "It is essential that we--like our patron Caxias--know 
how to protect the nation from itself," was the shot fired by 
the general, 63, who served originally in the artillery. 
Considered a hard-liner, he built his career alongside former 
Minister of Army Leonidas Pires Goncalves, and he was selected 
to add more, let us say, emphasis to the message. At the 
commemoration of Air Force Day on 23 October, Fernando Henrique 
had assured Minister of Army Zenildo de Lucena that the military 
would not be affected by the cuts built into his budget package. 
By failing to keep his word, Fernando became the most probable 
target of the section of Gen. Benedito Leonel's speech in which 
the latter talked about "irresponsibility, crooked dealing, and 
disrespect for our most important values." 
  Benedito (or Benedictus) Leonel concluded his speech by 
saying: "The time has not yet come for us to identify with the 
anguish of Marcus Flavinius." But the high command's howitzer 
had already hit its target: the government's strongbox. With the 
support of President Itamar Franco, who chose to diminish the 
credibility of his minister of finance and virtual candidate for 
president of the republic, the military have guaranteed that 
their uniforms will be safe from the effects of a package that 
is going to tighten the belts of ordinary Brazilians. Whereas 
the other ministries will have to work hard to stick to the $22 
billion in cuts promised by the president, the Army, Navy, and 
Air Force will keep their three strategic projects: the 
nuclear-powered submarine, the space program, and the 
Italian-Brazilian AMX fighter plane. 
  Operation "Kepi on the Forelock" was unleashed at the very 
cabinet meeting where the budget cuts were discussed: on Tuesday 
the 7th. "No, I don't agree. Would you like to have your pay cut 
in half?" Minister of Navy Ivan Serpa asked the head of the 
Planning Secretariat, Alexis Stepanenko. "I am doing what the 
president ordered. Why should he spare you?" Stepanenko shot 
back. He soon found out why. 
  The next day, Serpa made it a point to let his irritation be 
known far and wide. Choosing Serpa to be the spokesman for 
military discontent was a deliberate move: he is one of the 
ministers closest to Itamar Franco. He headed a threat of 
collective resignation by the military ministers, a resignation 
that would have had unforeseeable consequences. And Gen. Zenildo 
de Lucena, who had kept a low profile at the start of the 
controversy ("we get along the best we can" was his comment), 
delivered to the president a statement explaining why it was 
necessary to stick to the original budget. In his document, the 
minister warned that the cuts would cause a situation even more 
serious than that in 1992, when there was not enough food and 
soldiers were excused from duty early in the afternoon so they 
would not eat a second meal at the barracks. For its part, the 
Navy sent a lengthy document out in all directions explaining 
the extent of its crisis. 
  Every officer and every barracks became a trench in the 
operation unleashed by the senior officers. "The cuts will shut 
the Army down," said Army spokesman General Gilberto Serra in 
dramatic overstatement. "The Air Force's reserve supplies are 
nil," said the presiding judge of the Superior Military Court, 
General Cherubim Rosa Filho. "The FAB [Brazilian Air Force] has 
reached the bottom of the barrel in terms of operational 
effectiveness. It can conduct emergency operations only, and is 
not in condition for combat," he said in conclusion. "In terms 
of efficiency in Latin America, our Armed Forces are superior 
only to the military of Uruguay, Paraguay, Colombia, and 
Bolivia," said military analyst Roberto Lopes in agreement. 
Brazil ranks 73d among 140 countries in terms of military 
spending per capita. Each Brazilian spends $7 per year on his 
uniformed fellow citizens, compared to $55 in Chile. Cutting off 
military spending at the root would also throw a spadeful of 
lime onto the reeling Brazilian arms industry. "We would 
certainly have to close one of our firms: Aeroelectronics, which 
manufactures components for the AMX fighter," said Claudio 
Vianna, president of the Rio Grande do Sul group Aeromot. 
  At the Rio de Janeiro Military Club on Wednesday the 8th, 
the 
disagreement seemed likely to pass from words to action. Members 
of the reserve joined with mothers, wives, and children in an 
attempt to organize a march protesting low pay. A sergeant 3d 
class in the Army was earning 80,866 cruzeiros in November, 
while a private had to be content with 8,670 cruzeiros. The 
protest was halted by the arrival of General Bayma Denis, 
commanding officer of the Eastern Command. In accordance with 
instructions from the minister of Army, he tried to calm people 
down, but a degree of dissatisfaction remained. "There is no 
reason for us to stifle all the anguish among the troops," one 
officer commented. 
  Despite the rising temperature, almost no one mentioned a 
coup during the crisis. "The military have no plan to take power 
as they did before 1964, even though Brazilian society does not 
know what it wants from the Armed Forces," says analyst Roberto 
Lopes. The idea of a military mutiny was restricted to pockets 
of radicals such as the group headed by reserve Colonel Pedro 
Schirmer of Rio de Janeiro, who publishes the newspaper OMBRO A 
OMBRO and supports "energetic and bold measures even if they 
contradict false precepts that are allegedly democratic." In 
recent months, Schirmer's little group has been lining up with 
other coup-minded Latin American groups. His newspaper receives 
articles from Argentine "cara pintada" Mohamed Ali Seineldin, 
who is serving a life sentence, and General Francisco Efrain 
Visconti of the Venezuelan Air Force, who is in exile in Peru. 
  But rejection of a coup did not mean that the high command 
would no longer engage in politics. Quite the contrary. Minister 
Zenildo de Lucena himself breached his strictly military image 
by criticizing the Federal Supreme Court's vacillation about 
confirming the revocation of former President Collor de Mello's 
political rights. "As a Brazilian citizen, I was disappointed," 
the general said on Thursday the 9th. "We military men would 
never do that," agreed Admiral Arnaldo Pereira, chief of the 
EMFA [Armed Forces General Staff]. Taking advantage of that 
instance of impunity, General Luciano Casales, deputy chief of 
the EMFA, aimed a few projectiles at Congress. "The cost of the 
Armed Forces to Brazilian society is less than that of the 
corruption uncovered by the CPI's, including overbilling and tax 
evasion," he told ISTOE. 
  The civilian politicians have acknowledged the truth of what 
he says. "Their criticism is real. The country will not stand 
for it if the CPI leads to nothing, but I find the tone of some 
statements very worrying," said Deputy Jose Genoino (PT [Workers 
Party], Sao Paulo), a former guerrilla fighter in Araguaia who 
now has easy access to the military. And Senator Jarbas 
Passarinho (PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], Para), a colonel in 
the reserve who went over to the legislative branch and now 
heads the CPI on the Budget Committee, admits that "the major 
new development is the fact that the military are talking about 
politics, something that did not happen under the Collor 
administration." True, but Operation "Occupy Space" began before 
the crisis. At the end of November, a group of military 
lobbyists coordinated by Gen. Benedito Leonel and his 
legionnaires met with about 30 heavyweight businessmen at the 
headquarters of the FIESP [Sao Paulo State Federation of 
Industries] in Sao Paulo. The businessmen included the president 
of the FIESP, Carlos Eduardo Moreira Ferreira; and the president 
of the National Confederation of Industry, Senator Albano 
Franco. The purpose was to gain support among the businessmen 
for some of the dogmas dear to the military, one example being 
the continuation of compulsory military service. 
  The yearning by the military to enter deeply into the field 
of politics seems to have grown stronger in response to the 
absolute political vacuum accompanying the crisis following the 
announcement of Fernando Henrique's economic package. Congress, 
for example, has been unable to express itself as an 
institution--unlike the situation during Jose Sarney's 
administration, when Minister Leonidas Pires threatened the 
Constituent Assembly and encountered resistance from Deputy 
Ulysses Guimaraes at the head of the legislative branch. 
  President Itamar Franco's open support during the current 
crisis has also encouraged the military. At the traditional 
yearend luncheon for the chief of state and the principal 
commanders of the Armed Forces, which was held in Brasilia on 
Thursday the 9th, Itamar tried to belittle the civilian 
government by overstating the role of the military. "I have been 
trying to lead the administration in search of new paths, but I 
am forced to confront terrible obstacles," the president said, 
hinting that the terrible forces in question were impunity and 
the selfishness of the politicians. 
  The mutual attraction between Itamar and the military is not 
new. When he served two terms as mayor of Juiz de Fora in the 
1960's and 1970's, he gained easy access to the commanders of 
the 4th Army Division and the 4th Military Region, both 
headquartered in that city. Itamar was elected by the MDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement], a party that opposed the 
military regime, and he was a close friend of General Itibere 
Gouveia do Amaral, commander of the 4th Military Region. At the 
time, Municipal Councilor Francisco Fonseca of the rival Arena 
[National Renewal Alliance] charged that the Secretariat of 
Public Works in Juiz de Fora had diverted funds to pay for 
improvements on the general's farm in Bicas, 33 kilometers from 
Juiz de Fora. Over the past three weeks, Itamar has left his 
isolation in Planalto Palace only to participate in military 
ceremonies. Despite urging by advisers, the president has 
refused to participate in any ceremony involving civilians. 
Senator Jarbas Passarinho says sarcastically: "He is half 
soldier." 
  Following the success of their Operation "Kepi on the 
Forelock," the centurions in the three armed services certainly 
agree with Passarinho. Minister of Air Lelio Lobo went directly 
from the officers' luncheon with the president on Thursday to 
the Brasilia Air Base. There he boarded an FAB aircraft and soon 
landed in Sao Jose dos Campos, on his way to the office of the 
director of the Aerospace Technical Center (CTA), General Nelson 
Taveira. Lobo was there to give the go-ahead for continued work 
on the AMX project and the space program. The Navy obtained a 
promise that it could continue building its nuclear-powered 
submarine (which is not expected to be completed before 2020), 
and the Army will get funds for a new runway at the Agulhas 
Negras Military Academy in Resende, Rio de Janeiro. That is 
where the world pentathlon championship will be held in 1994. 
  The results of this military offensive did not stop there. 
The officer class is now taking it for granted that civilian and 
military personnel will be separated in the constitutional 
revision, thus making it possible to approve separate pay 
increases. The military adviser to Congress, Commander Sergio 
Porto da Luz, says it is "practically guaranteed" that the 
military will receive a 186-percent pay increase. That would 
make up for the pay they lost in 1993. It would also strike 
another very hard blow at Minister Fernando Henrique's policy of 
lean cows.

Paulo); Zenaide Azeredo, Ana Beatriz Magno, Raymundo Costa, and

  [Text] During a meeting with members of the 55th 
Anniversary of the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC] information 
caravan, Politburo member Jorge Lezcano, first secretary of the 
Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Havana City Province, stated 
that 1994 would be a difficult year, but very different from 
1993. He went on to say that the experience we have accumulated 
and the economic initiatives that are being implemented will 
allow us to confront challenges in all senses. 
  During the meeting, which was held on 13 January, Lezcano 
advised that conditions have been established to improve the 
transportation situation of the province. Lezcano added that 
more than 200 donated buses will arrive and the same number of 
so-called bus trains will be built for urban service. He added 
that they hope to increase the volumes of agricultural products 
with the development of the Basic Cooperative Production Units 
[UBPC's] that have been created, and with the harvests of the 
people's organically grown gardens, which have already begun 
selling vegetables. Lezcano highlighted the improvements in 
working conditions at work centers. Such is the case of the Port 
of Havana where they have achieved positive results in 
comparison with previous periods. 
  [Begin Lezcano recording] We are not talking about results 
that double the productivity of the worker. I do not know by how 
much their productivity has multiplied. Just yesterday and the 
day before yesterday, at the plenum of the party in Habana Vieja 
and Regla, we were analyzing this. The results have been 
extraordinary. They have been able to increase the number of 
tons per man; they have increased the number of containers per 
hour. Havana, for example, had previously produced two 
containers per hour. Nowadays, they are speaking of 38 
containers. That is truly amazing. Production fluctuation has 
considerably decreased. Before, the port had between 5,000 and 
6,000 workers, and it was not enough. [word indistinct] was 
tremendous. We had to constantly mobilize volunteer workers. 
Today, with approximately 3,500, there are people waiting in 
line to work at the port. 
  The other day, someone explained to us the work they did on 
the 30th, the 31st, and the 1st. It was like clockwork. During 
the last months of 1993, of 40 ships, 38 were dispatched 
rapidly. It seems that they have found an interesting formula 
with many perspectives. [end recording] 
  Jorge Lezcano also briefed the professionals of the national 
media on the principal accomplishments of 1993, highlighting 
achievements in such areas as education, construction, public 
health, and tourism. Furthermore, he praised the workers 
parliament process, which began on 12 January at the work 
centers of Havana City. 
  [Begin Lezcano recording] This process achieves two 
important 
things. One is that it considers the opinion of the people. Many 
important ideas can be obtained this way. With millions of 
people providing their ideas and suggestions, it is possible to 
receive ideas that some economists and officials may not have 
thought about, on the one hand. On the other hand, it is 
possible to see where they coincide. You can see that there will 
be greater acceptance of those measures that coincide. People 
participating and giving ideas. people recognizing that they are 
being consulted on the measures that are going to be 
implemented. This involves a very important political factor, 
the second aspect: The people understand and support the 
measures. When the people participate, they have the capacity 
and a higher likelihood of being able to participate in the 
implementation of those measures. [end recording] 
  Lezcano reiterated that 1994 will be a difficult year, but 
very different from 1993. He added: We have a greater awareness 
of the problems and how to solve them with increased efficiency 
and at lower material and human cost.

  [Text] Roseau, Dominica, 17 Jan, CANA -- Trade between 
Venezuela and some Caribbean Community (Caricom) states will get 
an additional boost, now that Venezuela has approved a mutual 
agreement for commercial fishing in the Caribbean, the 
Venezuelan Embassy says. 
  On December 16, the Venezuelan cabinet approved an 
"alternate 
proposal for commercial shipping to the Eastern Caribbean," a 
statement from the Embassy said. "The proposal aims to 
facilitate trade relations with this part of the Caribbean by 
augmenting the maritime transportation services existing at the 
moment." The agreement was approved December 27 and is in 
keeping with a trade and investment agreement between Caricom 
and Venezuela, which took effect one year ago. 
  Units of the Venezuelan Navy will be used on a commercial 
basis, and will serve initially, the Venezuela/Grenada/St. 
Lucia/Antigua route, the statement explains. These ports will be 
used as centres for the consolidation of freight, and it is 
hoped that other Eastern Caribbean countries will take advantage 
of what is regarded as a new opportunity for expanding 
export/import trade with Venezuela. 
  The move is also expected to strengthen intraregional 
shipping services.

  [Text] Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (EFE) -- The 
presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay today 
ratified that Mercosur [Common Market of the South] will go into 
operation on 1 January 1995. They also confirmed the new work 
program to overcome the problem related to the common external 
tariff which is preventing the creation of a customs union. 
  The presidents were not able to fulfill the objective of 
announcing an agreement on the external tariff which is the 
basis for the customs union before Mercosur goes into operation. 
This was the intention of the fifth Mercosur summit after the 
emergence of a number of problems related to percentages 
accepted by each country for the protection of heavy industry, 
electronics, informatics, and petrochemistry. 
  Brazil, which is the main Mercosur partner, wants tariffs of 
up to 35 percent on those items while Argentina accepts up to 12 
percent or a maximum of 14 percent on the exports of third 
countries. 
  Paraguay and Uruguay, the two smaller partners, are in favor 
of a minimum tariff to prevent being subject to Brazilian 
technology and to the lack of efficiency of those industrial 
sectors. 
  President Carlos Menem of Argentina, Itamar Franco of 
Brazil, 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay, and Luis Alberto Lacalle of 
Uruguay agreed today, upon opening the fifth summit, on the 
difficulties facing Mercosur in this decisive stage of its 
operation. 
  At the same time Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada, who attended the meeting as an observer, warned in his 
speech that the lack of political will has been the main cause 
of Latin American failure in the search for economic integration. 
  All the presidents who carried out intensive direct 
diplomatic activity to overcome the obstacles asserted their 
desire to continue despite the obstacles. 
  Paraguayan President Wasmosy was the one who clearly defined 
the current situation by indirectly criticizing those like 
Brazil which seek to maintain their traditional protectionism. 
  Wasmosy said that Mercosur will only represent "the opening 
of a market comparable to other world regions if there is a 
modern framework based on free trade and competition, and where 
traditional protectionism must adjust to the new scenario." 
  He also said that Mercosur must be "a system for new 
investments and technology, even the `advanced' ones, as well as 
real full employment." 
  On the other side, Brazilian President Franco, who admitted 
the future difficulties, expressed satisfaction with the 
progress of Mercosur, and with the growth of the economies of 
the four countries. 
  He supports the extension of the free trade agreements to 
Chile and the signing of other subregional agreements. He added, 
however, that the complete opening of the Brazilian markets will 
have "benefits proportional to the size of the openings in each 
of the other member countries." 
  In order to overcome the obstacles and interpretations, the 
presidents decided to approve a new program to define the 
external tariff. That program must conclude before the sixth 
summit scheduled for next July, six months before the date 
established by the Asuncion Treaty of 26 March 1991 to put 
Mercosur into operation. 
  That work program establishes concrete dates to define each 
item of the tariff and to move toward a common percentage for 
imports from third countries. 
  The experts believe that the less complex negotiations will 
conclude before May and that by July there will be a clear 
picture on the four most controversial items which Brazil hopes 
to protect from the imports from third countries: informatics, 
petrochemistry, capital goods, and electronics. 
  A timetable for reducing tariffs has been established, 
therefore, it is expected that by the year 2000 there can be a 
tariff of 12 percent for capital goods. 
  Regarding informatics and electronics, for which Argentina 
wants a tariff of 4 percent and Brazil 35 percent, the lowest 
possible tariff will be established by the year 2006 as a way to 
favor industrial reconversion.

  [Text] Colonia de Sacramento, Uruguay, 17 Jan (EFE) -- The 
presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay today 
agreed to integrate Bolivia as an observer country in all the 
meetings of the work subgroups of the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur). 
  The decision was made during the fifth Mercosur summit, 
which 
ended in the city of Colonia, after a formal petition made by 
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  Presidents Carlos Menem of Argentina, Itamar Franco of 
Brazil, Juan Carlos Wasmosy of Paraguay, and Luis Alberto 
Lacalle of Uruguay issued a public declaration expressing their 
satisfaction with the Bolivian Government's desire to extend and 
strengthen its ties with Mercosur. 
  The declaration states: "They thus considered it appropriate 
to respond to Bolivia's petition by inviting its representatives 
to participate, as observers, in the meetings of the work 
subgroups." 
  The presidents also state that "within the framework of 
Bolivia's petition, agreements with Bolivia will be prioritized 
with the perspective of its future total participation in 
Mercosur." 
  President Sanchez de Losada attended the summit as an 
observer and in his speech he stressed his country's interest in 
Mercosur without forgetting other integration agreements Bolivia 
has signed. 
  Technically, Bolivia cannot join Mercosur because it already 
belongs to the Andean Pact, but it can associate with it through 
a free market system. 
  The Bolivian president said before his colleagues that "we 
must recognize that we have failed" in Latin American 
integration "given the lack of political will to eliminate 
borders that are presently more in the minds of our countries' 
leaders than in geography." 
  Sanchez de Losada added: "Our peoples have always considered 
themselves brothers and sisters within a great Latin American 
family. In this process of attaining an ideal, we have fallen 
and risen many times, but we are learning." 
  "With past experience and the demands of our current times, 
we Latin Americans are taking more seriously the challenge of 
integration, and Mercosur is proof of this," he added. 
  "We Bolivians are convinced that efforts like Mercosur, the 
Andean Pact, and the Group of Three have the common objective of 
making progress toward a greater and broader integration," he 
stated. 
  Sanchez de Losada concluded by saying: "Bolivia plays a role 
in this process by being a point in common and a contact among 
regional groups. We are willing to play the role that 
corresponds to us given our continental vocation, our deep 
integrationist will, and our presence in the River Plate, 
Andean, Amazon, Pacific, and Atlantic areas."

  [Text] Colonia, Uruguay -- Paraguay has established a firm 
position regarding the integration process stressing that 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] will not be possible if 
the macroeconomic policies of the four member countries are not 
coordinated. 
  The firm Paraguayan position even forced the presidents to 
meet again yesterday afternoon after which the respective 
economy ministers were instructed to meet next April, in a place 
yet to be determined, to express each country's commitment to 
comply with the treaty's chapter on coordination of the economic 
policies. 
  Only under these conditions will Paraguay agree to continue 
negotiating the common external tariff to establish a customs 
union as of 1 January 1995. 
  In principle there is an agreement to reach a common 
external 
tariff within the following guidelines: the tariffs of 80 
percent of products agreed upon by the country members will 
converge according to the technical criteria adopted by the 
negotiators. That is, they will reach a common external tariff. 
  A list of sensitive products will be drawn up immediately. 
These products will be treated on an exceptional (that is, 
protectionist) basis until the year 2001. Very sensitive 
products will be protected until the year 2006. Within these 
latter products, which have yet not been totally specified, 
Paraguay managed to obtain zero import tariffs for raw materials 
or inputs for its national industrial production. 
  The country members can negotiate the list of sensitive 
products until April, and the very sensitive products until 30 
June 1994. 
  In his speech, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy said that 
Paraguay understands that the integration of Mercosur should 
develop through symmetrical and simultaneous progress in all 
market areas. The establishment of the common external tariff, 
he added, demands a coordination of macroeconomic policies and 
the harmonization of general and specific laws. This must be 
implemented by the country members together if the much desired 
common market is to be attained. 
  "This is why it is preferable to discuss the situation in 
the 
present and not on 31 December 1994 if we want to be efficient 
administrators of the Treaty of Asuncion," he said. 
  "Paraguay, as it has always been, is currently faithful to 
its integrationist vocation and ratifies its commitment to 
achieve a common market. Our four countries must act jointly and 
with solidarity, making a simultaneous and balanced effort to 
overcome the basic problems we just referred to," the Paraguayan 
president said. 
  The Paraguayan president also pointed out the need "to 
accept 
the reality and make the political decision of establishing 
reasonable deadlines to ensure that the final objective be 
reached in harmony with the adjustment process of the economies 
that will be integrated." 
  Wasmosy added that "it is also worthwhile to reflect on the 
possibility of creating a solidarity program in favor of the 
countries with less developed economies to stimulate the 
redistribution of resources in the region and to minimize the 
negative aspects that may come about with the adjustments that 
will be made to form the common market." 
  This solidarity, he said, could consist of technological and 
financial support to allow the industrial structures of the less 
developed economies to improve their level of efficiency and 
competitiveness which, without doubt, will benefit the community 
interests. He also asked for special treatment within the 
common external tariff framework for a greater amount of 
products sensitive for the less developed economies. 
  President Juan Carlos Wasmosy talked with the media and said 
he left the meeting very satisfied with the talks held with the 
presidents in Colonia. He said they spoke sincerely and that 
between now and 1 June it will be known with certainty whether 
Mercosur will work as a common market. Such is the period of 
time Paraguay asked for so that the country members could define 
and assume their commitment to make adjustments within their 
respective economies.

  [Text] Colonia, Uruguay -- The four presidents of the 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries have reaffirmed 
the principles, goals, and timetables established in the 
Asuncion Treaty to move ahead in a coordinated, balanced, and 
sustained manner toward the establishment of a customs union and 
setting the basis for structuring Mercosur in a joint communique 
released at the conclusion of the presidential summit. 
  They also noted that the coordination of macroeconomic 
policies is an essential condition for the sucess of the 
integration process. 
  They pointed out that the fulfillment of the timetable 
established in Las Lenas [Argentina], as well as the 
instrumentation of the decision of the Common Market Council on 
the common external tariff, measures, and instruments for 
structuring Mercosur, are a firm commitment of the four 
countries. They also agreed that the progress on the different 
priority areas must be made symmetrically and simultaneously. 
  Recognizing that the main challenge is to promote the 
prosperity of their people and to reach the highest standard of 
living, the presidents expressed their special satisfaction in 
face of the substantial trade increase within Mercosur which 
went from $3.6 billion in 1990 -- before the Asuncion Treaty was 
signed -- to more than $8 billion in 1993. 
  This accelerated trade growth is the result, among other 
reasons, of the fulfillment of the commercial liberation program 
which currently has a tariff preference of 82 percent between 
the states. 
  They also expressed their satisfaction over the technical 
progress reached on the common external tariff, and asserted 
their determination to conclude the definition of the common 
external tariff on 30 June 1994 as the basic instrument for 
structuring the customs union which is a significant stage for 
establishing the common market. 
  They also emphasized the importance of the special meeting 
to 
be held this year to establish the institutional structure of 
Mercosur. The meeting will serve to create the permanent 
institutions that will start operating on 1 January 1995. They 
also recognized the importance of the current and future works 
of infrastructure which are the basis of physical integration 
that also includes the water way. 
  In the joint communique the four presidents also recognized 
the importance of strengthening the Latin American Integration 
Association. They pointed out that it is essential to maintain 
the integrity of the 1980 Montevideo Treaty which made important 
projects possible. 
  They also expressed their safisfaction over the presence of 
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and reiterated 
their pleasure at the Bolivian Government's willingness to 
strengthen its links with Mercosur. They also noted the 
institutional cooperation provided by the EC with Mercosur as 
well as the cooperation given by the Inter-American Development 
Bank.

  [Text] Colonia, 17 Jan (EFE0 -- Uruguayan President Luis 
Alberto Lacalle, who was the spokesman for the Fifth Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South] summit that ended today, Monday, 
said that he is "pragmatically optimistic" that the common 
market will finally be set in motion on 1 January 1995. 
  During a press conference, Lacalle denied that there are two 
integration systems, a slow one and a fast one, "because we are 
not like the European Community [EC], which has 12 members; we 
are only four countries." 
  This idea was conveyed to observers by the speech by 
Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who demanded sincerity 
and who reported the series of problems that Mercosur is 
confronting. 
  Lacalle, who supported Wasmosy's speech because of its 
"frankness," explained that three years ago, when the Treaty of 
Asuncion was signed with short terms for implementation, "we all 
knew it would not be easy, because there are differences of 
opinion in all systems, even in NAFTA or in the EC." 
  He said Mercosur is moving forward "with urgent 
preestablished deadlines" that help expedite the process. 
  "One should be optimistic in all activities, and I am 
optimistic about the possibility of achieving integration, but I 
am also pragmatic, because we base our action on actual facts," 
Lacalle stressed. 
  Asked about what would happen if no agreement is reached 
over 
the single external tariff, which was not announced today -- 
especially because of the discrepancies between Brazil, which 
strongly protects its industry, and the other countries, which 
demand a low tariff to ensure the system's efficiency -- Lacalle 
replied with doubts, saying that "a solution may or may not be 
reached in June." 
  "We began a path toward integration which has gone through 
various phases. It is a dynamic process with different steps and 
stages, either under the name of common market or customs 
union," he said in order to minimize the cricism over the 
failure to reach an agreement to fully implement the system next 
year. 
  Lacalle also addressed the labor centrals, which are 
controlled by leftist groups, which were not granted an audience 
at the summit, and which released a communique in Montevideo. 
  "This is a meeting of nations. We are not a corporation. The 
presidents, who were democratically elected, represent their 
countries," Lacalle said. 
  "We are ready to listen to all the proposals that are 
consistent with the course that was agreed upon, and that are 
submitted to the Mercosur secretariat, which should then 
formulate them to be submitted to the presidents. We cannot 
transform these meetings into sessions for sectorial demands," 
he added. 
  He lamented that the labor centrals of Mercosur countries 
"do 
no want to use this system, preferring public demonstrations." 
  He emphasized the presidential declaration's point on the 
importance that matters dealing with employment, migration, the 
protection of workers, and the coordination of the labor 
legislation of member countries have for building the common 
market. 
  "They are difficult matters that we have not yet formalized 
but that we will jointly address in work groups," Lacalle said.

  [Text] President Cesar Gaviria does not want to get 
involved in the argument over the presence of U.S. troops in the 
country. Superficially and without going into details, he has 
responded to those who have dared to question the presence of 
these troops in the country. The U.S. troops are already in 
Juanchaco, but the debate on whether their presence should have 
received Senate approval is just beginning to get hot. 
  [Begin Senator Alfredo Vasquez Carrizosa recording] What is 
understood by the term troops is an armed and trained group 
under the command of an officer and the flag of a certain 
country. This is exactly what came to Colombia. [end recording] 
  Notwithstanding, the president told Senators Fabio Valencia 
and Gustavo Rodriguez, who demanded an explanation, the 
construction of a school and a health center did not merit a 
report to the Senate. 
  [Begin Senator Rodriguez recording] As a result of this 
theory or subterfuge by the president, which I believe is an 
effort to disregard the Constitution, we are yielding our 
national sovereignty to foreign troops, no more and no less. 
[end recording] 
  In addition, the Defense Ministry explained the entry of 
U.S. 
troops is backed by a mutual assistance defense agreement signed 
in 1952. 
  [Begin Carrizosa recording] The Constitution takes priority 
over any agreement signed by the Defense Ministry in 1952 and 
the Constitution demands permission from the Senate. [end 
recording] 
  While the controversy continues, 259 U.S. soldiers are in 
various parts of the country working on construction projects in 
spite of the opposition.

  [Text] Even though the Marines have already started working 
in Juanchaco, the population still has doubts concerning the 
North Americans' real intentions. We have followed the gringos' 
steps in their everyday life. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Why did you come 
this weekend to Juanchaco? 
  [Unidentified woman] Because I wanted to see what the 
gringos had done. I wanted to see them and to see whether it 
was true that they were here and what they had done. [end 
recording] 
  Indeed, tourists to the area, whose numbers have increased 
by 
nearly 35 percent, are coming to see -- practically to supervise 
-- the work of these U.S. soldiers, which for the people is 
still a mystery. For the inhabitants, it represents a genuine 
invasion. 
  The work under way in this lot, which is located 
approximately 2 km from the urban area of Juanchaco, begins at 
0700. Tourists and inhabitants of the area are denied access to 
this place. Some soldiers operate machines, while others remain 
on the make-shift landing strip that will service small 
airplanes and helicopters. Supposedly, small aircraft will be 
able to land here to bring materials that might be needed for 
the little school and the health center. 
  Even while the U.S. soldiers guard this place, they enjoy 
the 
exotic sights of Colombia. The North Americans only speak among 
themselves. They barely even speak to the Colombian soldiers. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] What do you do here? 
  [Unidentified Colombian soldier] I provide security for the 
gringos, follow them wherever they go, and check on them. [end 
recording] 
  It is precisely these people -- the Colombian soldiers -- 
who 
paradoxically have to prevent the gringos from coming in contact 
with the Colombian press. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter in English] Where is the school? 
  [Unidentified Colombian soldier, moving away from camera] 
Miss, please. [end recording] 
  The North Americans' work ends at 1700, when they return to 
the dock to leave for Bahia Malaga. 
  What these people are doing, or not doing, in Colombia is 
still a mystery. The only thing that is true is that what we 
have shown you is the daily routine they will carry out at least 
until the end of February, when they very well could still be in 
Colombia.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 10 January (DPA) -- Colombian 
Government sources announced that a bilateral meeting between 
the Colombian and Ecuadoran Army intelligence directors started 
today in Santa Fe de Bogota. 
  During the meeting attempts will be made to find solutions 
to 
the public order problems that have occurred during the past 
weeks in the border region. These problems include the death of 
several Ecuadoran soldiers, which are believed to have been 
caused by the Simon Bolivar National Guerrilla Coordinating 
Board [CNGSB]. 
  Colombian Army Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman pointed 
out that during this meeting, which will be held behind closed 
doors, they will attempt to establish the accuracy of reports 
circulating in Colombia. These reports are related to Ecuadoran 
Army units arresting several Colombian peasants on Colombian 
territory and accusing them of being guerrilla members. 
  Likewise, the meeting is intended to "formulate plans 
against 
guerrilla and criminal activities in the border region between 
both countries," Gen. Guzman emphasized. The officer also 
pointed out that the meeting constitutes part of the agreements 
signed several weeks ago by both countries' defense ministers.

  [Text] The remains of at least 60 human beings were found 
today in a mass grave in Landazuri Municipality, Santander 
Department. It is believed that the corpses have been there 
anywhere between two to five years. 
  There is already speculation as to why they are there. Some 
versions say it is the result of accounts settled among poppy 
growers. Other say the deaths was due to executions by 
guerrillas. 
  Amid five hectares of poppy plantations in the place known 
as 
El Roble Heights, in Landazuri Municipality in Santander 
Department, troops of the Rafael Reyes Infantry Battalion found 
a mass grave with the remains of at least 60 people buried some 
time within the past five years. According to the Army, they 
are all FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] 
guerrillas, and many of the victims have bullet wounds. 
  The "National" newscast has learned that apparently the 60 
murdered guerrillas could be the product of executions among the 
rebels because of disloyalty. The executions may have been 
ordered by Braulio Herrera, former representative to the chamber 
by the UP [Patriotic Union], when he was the fourth-ranking FARC 
commander. 
  For this deed, the former congressman was sentenced to death 
by the guerrilla command, but he was able to leave the country 
illegally. 
  However, the authorities of the Landazuri municipality 
believe the corpses found there could be the result of a war 
among poppy growers of the region. 
  In the town today there is an atmosphere of mourning and 
anxiety because never before had such serious deeds been 
registered in the jurisdiction.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Gustavo Rodriguez Vargas, a member of the Foreign 
Relations Advisory Commission, said today [11 January] that the 
OAS secretary generalship cannot be attained by ceding Colombian 
sovereignty. Rodriguez Vargas said that there is a need for a 
clearer policy regarding cases such as the presence of U.S. 
Marines in Juanchaco, on the Atlantic coast, and the incident 
involving the incursion by Venezuelan troops in Saravena, 
Arauca. In the case of Venezuela, Colombia has been too 
complaisant regarding the defense of our sovereignty. Some 
believe that President Cesar Gaviria is seeking the neighboring 
country's vote for the post of OAS secretary general, and have 
gone as far as to publish cartoons such as these. 
  [Begin Rodriguez recording] I hope President Gaviria does 
become the OAS secretary general, but it should not be at the 
expense of our national sovereignty. [end recording] 
  According to Gustavo Rodriguez, six of the seven meetings 
the 
commission has held have addressed the Venezuelan issue. 
Colombia first stepped back fearing Carlos Andres Perez' fall 
from power. Then it desisted in favor of the election process in 
Venezuela, and finally because of pressure from the Venezuelan 
press. SEMANA magazine reported on Gaviria's recent efforts. 
It says he spent his vacation on the telephone trying to 
recruit votes for the secretary generalship. He was after the 
votes of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Ecuador, and, of course, 
Venezuela, which has Miguel Angel Burelli running for that same 
post. According to the magazine, Gaviria even contacted 
Burelli. Experts on international policy believe Venezuela will 
support Costa Rica, and its candidate Bernd Neihaus, instead of 
Colombia. They would benefit more by supporting a Caribbean 
candidate than a Colombian. Experts also say that President 
Gaviria must choose between his aspirations at the OAS and 
defending national sovereignty.

<F P=106> [Interview with prospective Liberal Party presidential </F>
candidate Ernesto Samper; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Ernesto Samper returned to Colombia Thursday night 
after a two-week trip to the United States, Asia, and Mexico. On 
Friday he gave the following written interview to EL TIEMPO's 
political editor. 
  [EL TIEMPO] During your absence, President Cesar Gaviria 
said 
that dark forces were trying to create friction between the two 
of you. Do you think such forces exist? 
  [Samper] If the president says so, it must be so. The 
important thing is what he and I feel. I strongly support his 
actions concerning the government, the Constitutional Congress, 
drug traffic policy, and the internationalization of the 
economy. Along with the majority of the Colombian people, I 
believe President Gaviria's liberal government has been good for 
the nation and I support the renewal he has undertaken. 
Furthermore, the president knows when and on what occasions I 
have supported him at the times when he needed it. He also knows 
that I am not a person who keeps score on political debts. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Some commentators say some ministers should be 
removed from the cabinet to emphasize your conceptual and 
political differences with the president. What do you think? 
  [Samper] As I said before, I support President Gaviria's 
liberal government, so I find no reason to consider such a 
decision. Also, it is the president who decides about changing 
ministers. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Do you think there are electioneering intentions 
in the book by Mauricio Vargas that portrays you as a weak 
person more concerned about political position than about ideas? 
  [Samper] I will confess to you that I have not read the book 
by SEMANA's editor, though my friends agree that it is an 
anti-Samperist treatise. Nor do I know if there are political 
intentions behind it. If so, that would be the start of a new 
phase of politics in Colombia, a dirty war, which I am sure the 
Colombian people will categorically reject. The raw material for 
the political debate cannot continue to be inner-circle gossip, 
backbiting, and rumors. The people have the right to have the 
candidates talk to them about solving the problems of 
unemployment, corruption, or the lack of security; that is what 
we are really interested in. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Do you feel your campaign is being well run? 
  [Samper] Yes. It has gone well and the polls show that. I am 
concerned, though, about the changing course the campaign is 
taking. The Colombian people know my style of politics, based on 
ideas and proposals, like the ones I have been presenting during 
the past six months about issues like unemployment, agricultural 
recovery, or the fight against corruption. Now we are 
trivializing politics, reducing it to gossip, trivia, and the 
calumny of the passing moment. That is not good for anybody. 
Colombia should think big; that is what the Colombian people 
expect from those who aspire to lead the destinies of the nation. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Do you think you have lost spontaneity because 
of 
your advisers' strategies? 
  [Samper] If I have to lose spontaneity, I would rather lose 
my advisers. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Have you perceived uneasiness among your 
supporters in Congress about the way the campaign is going? 
  [Samper] I have not heard much about that; I will look into 
it more in the coming week. Although I know the people urging 
these changes are acting in good faith and constructively, I 
believe the campaign should be measured by its results. And the 
results show that when I first began my campaign in May, the 
polls put Dr. Pastrana 21 points ahead of me; now, six months 
later, our own polls and those of the president show that I am 
six points ahead of the candidate of the Pastranist sector of 
conservatism. That means we are up 27 points. How can people say 
the campaign is not working with results like that? I want to 
convince the leaders who are with me now so that, with their 
valuable assistance, we can appeal to other social sectors that 
have traditionally not taken part in elections. My campaign 
strategy has been to reach out to those sectors and open up new 
areas for dialogue in universities, unions, and associations. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Now that the Conservative Party has endorsed 
Andres Pastrana, do you think he is a rival who will force you 
to go to a second round? 
  [Samper] Some people in Colombia have an admirable capacity 
for being surprised by normal events. Who was not aware that the 
Conservative Convention of the Pastranist sector of conservatism 
would announce its support for Pastrana, as it did last week? 
What would really have been surprising and democratic is if the 
convention had chosen a popular vote process, as liberalism did, 
to select the conservative candidate in a transparent and 
participatory manner, or if at the convention organized by Dr. 
Pastrana, Dr. Alvaro Gomez Hurtado and other conservative 
candidates for the nomination had been present. Unfortunately, 
that did not happen. Anyway, I am sure of getting enthusiastic 
support from liberalism and other political groups after the 
party vote so I will win the first round by a KO [knockout]. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What did you learn during the trip from which 
you 
have just returned? 
  [Samper] We did not realize Colombia's importance 
internationally. We tend to concentrate on small details, so we 
lose sight of what Colombia represents, the way the 
international community sees us. While people outside look at 
Colombia through a telescope, we focus on things through a 
microscope. We need to change that. If Colombia wants to move 
forward, we have to think big. For example, President Salinas 
told me he is convinced that Colombia could play in the same 
arena as Mexico: in the Pacific Rim community, in the Group of 
Three, and through the latter it could join in NAFTA [North 
American Free Trade Agreement], a connection that would right 
away generate over 150,000 new jobs, as Minister [of Foreign 
Trade] Santos was told.

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential hopeful and New Democratic </F>
Force leader Andres Pastrana by Ana Maria Matute, in Venezuela; 
date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Matute] What exactly does New 
Democratic Force mean? 
  [Pastrana] As in Venezuela, there was traditionally a 
two-party system in Colombia. The system actually began breaking 
up in the 1990 elections when the M-19 rejoined public life and 
consolidated its position as a third party. This new political 
movement has grown stronger since then in the National 
Constituent Assembly. We in New Democratic Force started getting 
involved during the elections for senators, when their mandate 
was revoked. We are neither a party nor a political movement. 
This means that we do not have legal status, that we are not 
registered as a party. We are different from the Conservative 
and Liberal parties and the Democratic Alliance (M-19), which as 
a result get certain benefits from the government. We have 
chosen not to register. I invited Liberals to take part, I 
invited my Conservative Party, and independents. Today we have 
eight senators, two of whom are from the Liberal Party. 
Moreover, I have not resigned from my party. I have not told the 
Liberals to resign from their party; rather, I have said that we 
should put together a political force. What is happening in 
Latin America is that the parties are wearing themselves out and 
have ceased to be spokesmen for their people. People no longer 
expect the answers to be Liberal or Conservative, just as I am 
sure that in Venezuela one party alone cannot govern. 
  [Matute] How would you define yourself ideologically? 
  [Pastrana] As I told you, I have not resigned from my party, 
the Conservative Party. In accordance with the new philosophy, I 
would define myself as a centrist. As for economic policy, I 
believe in the liberalization and the integration that are 
taking place in the world. In this regard we have backed 
President Gaviria. The development minister belongs to the 
political movement of New Democratic Force. We believe that some 
adjustments have to be made in connection with this policy in 
Colombia's case, especially in the area of agriculture. I think 
that the country has to aim for growth of over six percent, but 
along with the well-being of its people. We have to lend a 
social meaning to this economic growth. In this case I have 
backed President Gaviria's efforts to do so because I think that 
this is the way to lead the country into the future. 
  [Matute] Hasn't such support for a Liberal president carried 
a high political price for your career? 
  [Pastrana] A few days ago I said that I do not hope that 
things go bad for President Gaviria so that they will go well 
for Andres Pastrana. I hope that things go well for President 
Gaviria so that things go well for Colombians. And I think that 
this is what people are hoping for today. I signed a political 
accord with Gaviria and for this reason I am part of the 
administration. It is a political accord under which I can 
continue to disagree with him. I personally think that social 
investment in Colombia has been weak. We have to really earmark 
resources in order to move the country forward. I think that 
governments have to be supported for what they do well and 
criticized for what they do poorly, and this is what we are 
doing. 
  [Matute] Do you think that the manner of practicing politics 
is changing? 
  [Pastrana] I think that there is another way. People may 
think at times that a political group is involved in an 
administration in order to reap benefits. When I joined 
President Gaviria's administration, Pablo Escobar had just 
escaped from prison, and energy rationing was starting. In other 
words, President Gaviria was at his low point. I think that this 
is the new way of practicing politics. To a great extent this is 
being shown in Venezuela, because Convergence is made up of 17 
parties. In the case of Venezuela, even though COPEI [Social 
Christian Party] is a party and AD [Democratic Action] is a 
party, what the presence of Convergence may show is this: that 
problems today cannot be identified as problems for AD or COPEI 
members. As I think is the case in Colombia, problems are 
neither Liberal nor Conservative; they belong to everyone. And I 
think that in the face of this, if we can join efforts, we will 
succeed, that is to say, form a national government. 
  [Matute] If you are elected, will you deal with Congress 
through pacts? 
  [Pastrana] No, what I am talking about is the presidential 
election; this is what we are putting together a movement for. 
We are not submitting slates for Congress. We are putting 
forward a political agenda for the presidency. 
  [Matute] What is your government program? 
  [Pastrana] We have not yet put forward our government 
program 
because we have not officially put forward a candidate. Our aim 
is to launch the campaign officially this January with a pledge 
in the form of a government plan. What Colombians are expecting 
today is a very specific program to deal with the problems 
besetting them. This is why it is hard at the moment to talk 
about a plan. 
  [Matute] Colombia's two main presidential hopefuls, you and 
Ernesto Samper, are being accused of using image, propaganda, 
and the mass media more than contact with the people. 
  [Pastrana] If there is any distinguishing feature of Andres 
Pastrana in politics, it is the slogan that I used during the 
campaign for mayor: "saying and doing." And this is why I want 
to commit myself to a government program. But I want to commit 
myself to Colombians on the things that I can do as president. 
They have tried to stereotype Andres Pastrana as someone who 
does not speak up. But, as I said before, I am not officially a 
candidate. Therefore, my campaign has not begun officially. I 
have tried to introduce new styles in politics. During the past 
election campaign for Congress we managed to get a half-million 
votes in a month and a half without delivering a single speech. 
  [Matute] How did you manage that? 
  [Pastrana] Traveling all over Colombia, talking with people, 
exchanging personal opinions with them. This is the same thing 
that I have wanted to do in the presidential campaign. I have 
been traveling around the country listening to people. In 
general, it is the candidate who talks to the people, but we 
never listen to the people so that a candidate can express what 
they want through a government program. We are now holding 
forums in each department to learn about people's deep-seated 
concerns and worries, to find out what the priority projects are. 
  [Matute] What is Andres Pastrana's diagnosis of Colombia? 
  [Pastrana] The main issue in the country, and we cannot hide 
it, is security. I think that with Pablo Escobar's death we are 
doing away with one of the problems, which was narcoterrorism. 
We are thus beginning a new chapter in Colombia's history. But 
the guerrillas and crime in the streets remain. Infrastructure 
is the other major issue. A study by the U.S. firm Monitor on 
competitiveness in Colombia, an issue that our development 
minister, Luis Alberto Moreno, has been addressing in this 
administration, says that Colombian exporters' costs are 12 to 
14 percent higher owing to the lack of roads. It is very 
difficult to compete like that. We have to build all this 
infrastructure so that the liberalization can expand and we can 
compete on an equal footing. [passage omitted] 
  [Matute] In your opinion, what is the best way for Colombia 
and Venezuela to settle the pending problem of delimiting 
offshore areas? 
  [Pastrana] I personally believe in direct negotiations, as 
they are called for in the San Pedro Alejandrino accord. But I 
am going to be clear about this. I proposed an agreement to put 
the delimitation issue on ice, because I do not think that it 
ought to be a campaign issue. Venezuela kept its word, and the 
candidates tacitly honored the agreement; the issue of the 
delimitation was not a campaign issue. They heeded my proposal. 
My worry is that in Colombia the candidates agreed to put it on 
ice only until after the presidential election in Venezuela. I 
think that the agreement has to extend until after our 
presidential campaign. The other issues I think should continue 
being discussed. 
  [Matute] Don't you think that the issue of immigration has 
been brought up in the campaign in Colombia? 
  [Pastrana] Right now, yes. But I do not think that we can 
continue to view relations from a negative perspective all the 
time. People say that kidnapping is going on in Venezuela; they 
complain about guerrilla raids. These are problems that directly 
affect us and indirectly affect Venezuela. At times minor 
problems disrupt relations between the two countries. There is 
even one issue that is insignificant to us but not to Venezuela: 
car theft. We have to do away with the scourge of kidnapping. We 
have to look for ways to control our borders so that we can put 
an end to these crimes both here and there. Let us hope that the 
issue of immigration is not used for political purposes in 
Venezuela either. President Velasquez has said that he is going 
to review Decree 1911. I think that it has to be. In the final 
accounting, there are Colombians who have helped to develop this 
country, just as there have been Venezuelans in Colombia. We 
cannot say that problems do not arise for us, both here and 
there. The important thing is to investigate these complaints 
and, if there are violations between the two countries, to 
punish the guilty. 
  [Matute] Would one of the ways be to set up a bilateral 
commission on immigration? 
  [Pastrana] Yes, this would enable the two countries to sit 
down and talk about the issue of immigration, whether offices 
need to be opened up along the border; it would provide a place 
to look into the problems, to investigate. The most important 
thing is to view relations not in terms of the past but with an 
eye towards the future. I told President Rafael Caldera: Why 
don't we use the Andean Pact as a bloc to negotiate a free-trade 
agreement with the United States. Trade between the two 
countries is almost $1.5 billion. This is something that I do 
not think most people would ever imagine. This entire process is 
irreversible. There were fears in Colombia that President 
Caldera might be thinking about backtracking; I do not think so. 
On the contrary, I am optimistic now. We know Caldera; we know 
who he is, and we know that relations between the two countries 
are going to grow stronger in several ways. One of them has to 
be integration. I think that the Group of Three has been a 
significant example of development. All of this is not going to 
be easy, but these efforts at integration and liberalization are 
important to us. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Murcia: "Candidates' Offensive Against </F>
Voter Apathy"] 
  [Text] In the weeks ahead, particularly in 
January, presidential and congressional candidates will launch a 
major propaganda and proselytizing offensive aimed at 
penetrating the apathy that has seriously affected the election 
campaign. 
  Many candidates are very concerned about the conclusions 
drawn by pollsters suggesting that 40 to 50 percent of all 
Colombians have no interest in the four elections to be held in 
1994. The number of undecided voters is also high. Under such 
conditions, if politicians do not adopt a more convincing 
attitude toward the voters, more could abstain than in previous 
years, these same analysts say. 
  Neither presidential candidate Ernesto Samper Pizano nor his 
campaign managers and advisers agree. They predict that 
enthusiasm among Liberals will pick up in 1994 and equal that 
seen in previous campaigns. They claim that Liberals could make 
up 55 or 60 percent of the total number of voters. They estimate 
that over 3.5 million Liberals will vote, 2 million for Samper 
and the rest split by the remaining four precandidates still in 
the race by 13 March: Humberto de la Calle, Carlos Lemos 
Simmonds, Rodolfo Gonzalez, and David Turbay. It is rumored that 
Luis Guillermo Sorzano is preparing to launch his candidacy for 
the Senate although he has delayed the announcement. 
<H5>  Election Calculations </H5>
  They estimate that some 6 million persons will go to the 
polls to cast their ballots for the various parties and groups 
in the congressional elections. For obvious reasons, that figure 
could be somewhat lower for the presidential elections because 
the lure and intensive work of congressional candidates will be 
missing. However, at the last minute, the element of the mayoral 
and gubernatorial races could possibly rouse voters out of their 
apathy. 
  The Conservative election between presidential candidates 
called by the union of the "rebel quintuplets": Rodrigo Marin, 
Rodrigo Llorente, Juan Diego Jaramillo, Gabriel Melo, and 
Roberto Gerlein, but rejected by those following the guidelines 
of the Conservative leadership supporting Andres Pastrana, could 
rally some 600,000 votes, according to its organizers' 
estimates. However, when one considers that the Conservative 
Party could win nearly 160,000 votes for Congress, the party 
could find itself in a difficult situation due to the split into 
two major blocs for the 8 May elections. One group would back 
Andres Pastrana while the other would rally behind the candidate 
chosen from among Rodrigo Marin, Juan Diego Jaramillo, Rodrigo 
Llorente, Gabriel Melo, and Roberto Gerlein. 
  Under these conditions, the Conservative picture does not 
look particularly promising because Alvaro Gomez Hurtado is 
expected to make his political move following the 13 March 
elections and there is no indication of which way he will go. 
While Gomez Hurtado has not sided with either faction, his 
silence is an obvious sign of indirect support for the "rebel" 
election. 
  It will not be easy to control Congress for the coming 
elections because senatorial candidacies are nationwide. This 
fact forces candidates to spread out all over the country, 
changing the terms of regional politics. In addition, the 
separation of congressional elections from those for councils, 
assemblies, mayoralties, and governorships leads one to think 
that terrorist groups might do their utmost to disturb law and 
order. 
<H5>  Everything To Win </H5>
  Although public opinion polls point to a possible tie 
between 
Samper and Pastrana on the first presidential ballot, it should 
be noted that after the Liberal nomination, the Liberal 
precandidates now opposing Samper will back him. In contrast, 
Pastrana will face a split in his party that appears to be 
irreversible. While Pastrana could possibly win a few Liberal or 
independent followers, he will not have other elements in his 
camp like those that backed Belisario Betancur's national 
candidacy in his race against Alfonso Lopez Michelsen. The 
latter was a candidate who faced Liberal resistance and, above 
all, a very strong rival in the ranks of his own party: Luis 
Carlos Galan, who is a far cry from Enrique Parejo. 
  Among his political assets for 1994, Samper can also rely on 
the fact that Gaviria's positive image resulting from the blows 
the latter dealt to drug trafficking will help him more than 
they will Pastrana. This is so even though he has had to put 
some distance between himself and this government on such issues 
as agrarian policy, the economic liberalization program, and 
social security reform. He also hopes to get on well with the 
followers and leadership of the Democratic Alliance M-19, mainly 
because of similar positions on many social, economic, and 
political issues. 
<H5>  Favorable Star </H5>
  Andres Pastrana, to whom the past two weeks have not been 
kind because of the revolt of the quintuplet union and because 
of what happened to his cousin, Gustavo Pastrana Gomez, 
diplomatic adviser in Uruguay, is confident that his good rating 
in public opinion polls will hold until May because to date, his 
campaign has been waged more on image than on any platform. His 
visit to Venezuela on Wednesday was an attempt to win back 
points and divert attention to other issues. In that 
international action he had the support of Development Minister 
Luis Alberto Moreno, his future campaign director. 
  All predictions revolve around two key persons in the 
campaign: Andres Pastrana and Ernesto Samper, assuming that no 
blows will be struck in the elections. However, Enrique Parejo, 
Miguel Alfredo Maza Marquez, Antonio Navarro, Humberto de la 
Calle, and Carlos Lemos are confident that the rules of play 
will change in their favor and that the "sure bets" are in for a 
surprise. "They have ruled us out ahead of time, but they are 
going to get the surprise of their lives," Parejo says, dreaming 
of an election fluke. "It's not over yet," De la Calle argues. 
Lemos is quieter, perhaps because he is beginning to be named 
for the vice presidential spot in Julio Cesar Sanchez's 
proposal, the key to a "winning team" with Samper.

  [Text] Next year our country will launch a new health care 
system aimed at rapidly expanding coverage so that by the year 
2000, nearly 90 percent of the population will be totally 
covered. 
<H5>  Private Coverage </H5>
  The bill passed by Congress sets up units known as Health 
Promotion Agencies (EPS) that will be responsible for collecting 
contributions from workers and business owners (12 percent of 
the total monthly payroll) and for contracting for health care 
services to be paid for out of these resources. 
<H5>  Higher Dues </H5>
  The new plan means a 71-percent increase in the contribution 
for health care. To date, employers and workers have paid in 7 
percent. According to estimates of the National Association of 
Industrialists (ANDI), additional contributions paid into the 
Social Security Institute by members will total 233.5 billion 
pesos, 156.5 billion from employers, and 77 billion from workers. 
  An employee earning 100,000 pesos next year (roughly the 
minimum wage) will pay 3,960 pesos of that sum for health 
insurance for himself and his family. Under the current system, 
he would pay only 2,310 pesos. 
  The employer's contribution rises from 4,666 to 8,040 pesos, 
with the additional resources used to provide the entire family 
of the insured with basic health care, including common 
illnesses and maternity coverage. 
<H5>  Two Systems </H5>
  The reform creates two major systems: the contributory 
system 
and the subsidized system. The former will cover persons with 
contracts, government employees, pensioners, and independent 
workers able to pay. The subsidized system will include persons 
unable to pay who will receive economic assistance to make their 
contribution to the system. Such assistance will come from a 
Solidarity Fund. 
  Members will have freedom of choice. They will be able to 
select the EPS they prefer or transfer to one providing better 
services. 
<H5>  Subsidy </H5>
  What will be the source of the subsidy? Health Promotion 
Agencies will collect contributions from employers and workers. 
These funds will be used to pay for the basic health plan and 
administrative overhead. However, in some cases, there will be a 
surplus that must be transferred to the Solidarity Fund. 
Subsidies will be financed out of these resources and other 
funds transferred from the Central Government or municipalities. 
  How will the surplus be generated? First of all, the 
National 
Social Security Council for Health Care will determine how much 
the health care of every member costs. For example, if it 
estimates the cost to be 200,000 pesos a year, the EPS may 
retain only that amount for every member covered. However, in 
many cases, the agency may have a large number of persons 
earning high incomes, meaning that 12 percent of their salaries 
would amount to far more than the cost of the health care. In 
such cases, the surplus will be paid into the fund, effectively 
creating solidarity between the rich and the poor. 
<H5>  No Cuts </H5>
  How does the plan work? The law states that the basic health 
plan to be provided by the EPS will be the same as the one now 
offered by the Social Security Institute. In other words, it 
will include a package of services covering common illnesses and 
maternity at all levels. It will also cover any and all 
diagnostic services, medical treatment, surgery, and 
rehabilitation deemed necessary. 
<H5>  No "Preexisting Conditions" </H5>
  There will be no such thing as "preexisting conditions" in 
the system. This means that members will receive care even if it 
can be demonstrated that a specific disease was contracted 
before coverage as a member began. 
  For the first time, the pension reform will allow the 
participation of private pension funds, which will begin to 
compete for the contributions of Colombian workers. 
<H5>  Gradual Readjustment </H5>
  Payments into either of the two systems will gradually rise 
from 8 to 13.5 percent based on the following schedule: 11.5 
percent in 1994; 12.5 percent in 1995; and 13.5 percent in 1996. 
  Of that amount, 3.5 percent will go to pay for disability 
and 
survivor benefits and the administrative overhead of the system, 
whether it be the ISS or a private fund. 
  In the latter case, however, the government has decided that 
in order to promote competition, to the extent that the funds 
are more efficient, they may voluntarily transfer part of the 
3.5 percent into their members' savings accounts. 
  Under both systems, employers will pay 75 percent of the 
dues 
and workers the remaining 25 percent. 
<H5>  Solidarity Fund </H5>
  In order to expand coverage and enable persons with low 
incomes to secure a retirement pension, a Pension Solidarity 
Fund is being set up that will also benefit athletes, artists, 
bullfighters, women operating small businesses, "community 
mothers," and the physically challenged. 
  During its first year of operation, the Fund hopes to obtain 
over 40 billion pesos from an additional 1-percent contribution 
paid by employees earning over four minimum monthly wages. 
<H5>  Retirement Age </H5>
  In order to be entitled to an old-age pension, a worker must 
be over 55 in the case of women or 60 in the case of men and 
have paid into the system for a minimum of 1,000 weeks (whether 
continuously or with interruptions), i.e., 20 years. 
  Effective 1 January 2014, the age at which one becomes 
eligible for the retirement pension rises by two years: to 57 
for women and 62 for men. 
  Those covered by the private system are entitled to a 
retirement pension at whatever age they choose, provided the 
total amount of funds that have accumulated in the individual 
account allows them to have a monthly pension exceeding 110 
percent of the legal minimum monthly wage at the time. 
<H5>  Amount of Pension </H5>
  The amount of the old-age pension based on the first 1,000 
weeks of contributions will be equivalent to 65 percent of the 
base distribution income. 
  However, for every additional 50 weeks and up to a total of 
1,200, the percentage rises by 2 percent to a maximum of 73 
percent. From 1,200 to 1,400 weeks, the percentage will rise by 
3 percent up to a maximum sum of 85 percent of the base 
distribution income. In the case of private pension funds, the 
terms are different because the amount will depend on individual 
savings and their financial yield. 
<H5>  How Amount Is Calculated </H5>
  In order to calculate the base distribution income, the last 
10 years or the entire time worked will be taken into account, 
depending on which alternative is more beneficial to the retiree. 
<H5>  Exclusions </H5>

  The following will be excluded from the system of individual 
savings: those receiving disability pensions or persons who, 
when the system takes effect, are over 40 years of age in the 
case of men and 35 in the case of women, and those who have paid 
into the ISS for over 750 weeks. 
<H5>  Transfers </H5>
  Persons deciding to transfer from the ISS to private funds 
will receive a pension bonus. The bonus will recognize 
contributions made since the worker joined, with allowance being 
made for inflation and the yield such contributions would have 
paid.

  [Text] The greatest fear of business owners and merchants 
concerning new obligations imposed by the Social Security Law 
has to do with added labor costs, the difference between the two 
pension systems, and the concentration of power in the hands of 
the Ministry of Health. 
  Spokesmen for the private sector say the new system will 
once 
again force businesses to raise prices on their products or 
accept lower profits. 
  This is how businessmen and merchants will cover the 
increase 
in payroll costs resulting from the adjustment in pension 
contributions and the change in the proportion of contributions. 
  The new Social Security Law provides that employers will pay 
75 percent of the pension contribution and workers the remaining 
25 percent. Employers currently pay only two-thirds of the 
contribution. 
  The National Association of Industrialists (ANDI) has from 
the very beginning opposed the disproportionate share of the 
dues, arguing the high labor costs it generates for businesses. 
  It holds that, when combined with the increase in 
contributions, not only will this factor generate inflationary 
pressures, but higher labor costs could result in a loss of 
ability to compete internationally for Colombian goods and 
services. 
  According to Andres de la Espriella, president of the 
Colombian Association of Garmentmakers (ASCONFECCION), the 
greatest impact will be felt by small and medium-size 
enterprises which, while paying the lowest wages, are among the 
biggest contributors because the industry is labor-intensive. 
  In his opinion, the goods produced by such industries will 
reflect a substantial price increase in the early months of next 
year. 
  Luis Gustavo Florez, president of the Federation of 
Metallurgical and Metal-Machine Industries (FEDEMETAL), warns 
that passing on the added cost to prices will not be possible in 
all sectors. 
  He thinks the economic liberalization program [apertura 
economica] reduces the room that businessmen once had to pass on 
added costs to consumers. 
  He says the added costs will be reflected in the profits of 
companies in his sector because they intend to adjust prices by 
only 14 or 15 percent in 1994. 
  Businessmen are also concerned about differences in the 
number of weeks of contributions required by private funds and 
the Social Security Institute (ISS) because they do not allow 
for real competition between the two systems. 
<H5>  Health Care </H5>
  Sabas Pretelt de la Vega, president of the National 
Federation of Businessmen (FENALCO), challenged a number of 
articles in the health reform. 
  His major criticisms are directed at the concentration of 
power in the hands of the Ministry of Health, which will be 
responsible for outlining services provided by health care plans 
for Colombians. 
  Pretelt also questions the possibility that the ministry 
could channel resources from the system to finance health 
programs. 
  He argues that in so doing, the Health Promotion Agencies 
would be turned into mere "delegates." 
  "Never before have we had such interventionism on the part 
of 
the government," the FENALCO official said, going on to claim 
that such a policy runs counter to the process of modernizing 
government.

  [Text] Leaving health in the hands of the private sector, 
increasing contributions and the number of weeks required for 
eligibility, and reducing the amount of the basic retirement 
pension are among the reasons why the country's major labor 
unions reject the Social Security reform plan passed by Congress. 
  The United Workers Confederation (CUT), the General 
Confederation of Democratic Workers (CGTD), and the National 
Federation of Government Workers (FENALTRACE) all reject the 
reform, calling it "ill-fated" for employers, workers, and the 
country in general. 
  "It is a mistake to turn health services over to the 
agencies. There is a danger that those most in need will no 
longer be served and that the overall health care that they 
formerly received at hospitals will be considerably diminished," 
CUT official Isaias Cristancho warned. 
  He also said that raising Social Security contributions from 
15 to 25.5 percent of wages and increasing the number of weeks 
that one would have to pay into private pension funds would have 
a negative impact. 
  Yesid Garcia, deputy secretary of the CGTD, said his union 
opposed the creation of pension funds and the fact that the 
financial sector would handle Colombians' savings. He proposes 
instead that procedures be put in place enabling the ISS to 
handle such resources as part of its investment portfolio. 
  The Confederation notes that the plan increases the number 
of 
weeks one is required to pay as well as the amount of 
contributions, raises the retirement age, and lowers the amount 
of the basic pension from 75 to 65 percent of wages, all of 
which points it rejects. 
  It also opposes the method of figuring the basic pension, 
which will henceforth be calculated based on wages earned for 
the last 10 years or the entire time worked. At present, only 
the last two years are considered.

  [Text] The new pension and health system was greeted with 
certain reservations by the Colombian financial system. In 
giving the reason for their reservations, the financial 
institutions argue that a number of inequities place private 
pension funds at a disadvantage compared with the Social 
Security Institute (ISS). 
  Nevertheless, it is hoped that with proper regulations, not 
only will there be greater competition, but also a smooth 
implementation of the law. 
  For insurers, the reform is a positive step because it ends 
the government monopoly over pensions and health care and 
launches a process consisting in offering a pension based on the 
savings of every worker. 
  In addition, it is emphasized that for the first time in the 
country's history, competition is allowed between public and 
private entities, with complete freedom for every worker to 
choose between the systems based on the quality of services 
offered in terms of pensions and health care. 
  There is one drawback, however: The cost of the reform aimed 
at expanding retirement and health care coverage will be 
substantial. 
  William Fadul, president of the Union of Colombian Insurers 
(FASECOLDA), said it will be necessary to review differences 
established in the number of weeks of payment required and the 
age at which one becomes eligible for a pension, as well as the 
generous criteria for determining disability. 
  For the National Association of Financial Institutions 
(ANIF), the reform could be described as "battered but 
surviving," inasmuch as the imbalances favor the ISS. 
  "They did everything possible to discriminate against the 
funds, meaning that the workers earning the lowest wages will 
have to pay a kind of toll to join," ANIF President Javier 
Fernandez Riva said. 
  He emphasized the workers' freedom to choose because it will 
promote competitiion and improve ISS services, but he is 
concerned that before one may transfer to a fund, a statement 
before a notary is required. 
  Invertir [Invest] President Fernando Borda said the reform 
is 
good, but could have been better. He did admit, however, that it 
was impossible to do more because it was very difficult to 
juggle the interests of employers, workers, financial 
institutions, and the unions. 
  He said that for those earning over the minimum wage, it may 
be better to join a private fund because with a good yield, a 
larger pension can be had. 
  Invermanana President Juan Francisco Hernandez said that 
much 
of the working population earning the minimum wage should stick 
with the ISS because if a minimum wage is guaranteed, why pay 
150 weeks more?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Javier Fernandez, president of the National </F>
Association of Financial Institutions (ANIF): "The Surviving 
Reform"] 
  [Text] The Social Security Law just passed by Congress is 
one of the most important economic reforms of recent decades. 
Many persons played a part in this achievement, starting with 
the president, who initiated the legislation and without whose 
vision and decisive support the change would not have had any 
hope of success. 
  I must reserve space here to comment on the substance of the 
law, but I would at least like to emphasize the fact that 
Minister of Labor Luis Fernando Ramirez, who actually authored 
the reform of the retirement system, won the admiration of the 
country by virtue of his mastery of the subject, his 
perseverance, calmness, and recognized effectiveness in 
promoting a proposal for which many had repeatedly given up hope 
this past year. 
  Black marks will go on the records of the various 
obstructionist forces that were bent on throwing a monkey wrench 
into the works in order to halt the process or derail it. In 
some cases, the opposition was predictable for simple 
ideological reasons. For the historical record, however, it 
would be false to claim that the unions or most of Colombia's 
economists in the academic world played a positive role in the 
passage of this far-reaching reform. 
  Unfortunately, the proposal did not come out of the test 
intact. Obviously, not all of the modifications in the 
government's original version could honestly be considered as 
"improvements," and several are inappropriate. Nevertheless, the 
real "guts" of the reform were saved. Beginning next year, 
Colombians will have an alternative to the traditional 
inefficient and excessive government monopoly over the 
administration of pensions. 
  Fortunately, the idea of opponents of private pension funds 
of crippling them at birth by virtue of a "mixed" system in 
which Colombians opting for such funds would remain bound to the 
ISS for life failed to thrive. Although two pension systems will 
exist in the future--including the common pot--at least 
membership in either one will be exclusive. 
  Unfortunately, a populist thrust in Congress altered the 
essence of the system of distribution by providing that the 
Treasury will cover any shortfall. The provision is so absurd, 
fiscally speaking, that workers would do well to foresee that 
once the inevitable cash deficit occurs in the system, the law 
may be modified to raise dues or cut benefits. 
  With respect to the relationship between dues and benefits 
offered by the system of services provided, insufficient 
progress was made to guarantee that the system will be 
financially balanced. In addition, an absurd regressive subsidy 
was maintained, higher for persons in upper-income brackets than 
for those in the lower brackets. However, dues were at least 
increased, the minimum number of weeks of payment required for 
eligibility was raised, retirement ages were modified slightly, 
and a correction was made in the absurd current rule that a 
person retires with the wage he was paid for the last two years, 
an inexhaustible source of abuses. 
  Any demagogue could argue that cutting benefits and 
increasing dues imply an improvement in the system, but I 
believe it is to insult the intelligence of Colombians to 
suggest that one can maintain a dreadful financial imbalance in 
the system of retirement without forcing workers having to pay 
the price in the end and, what is worse, doing so in a 
disorganized, traumatic fashion once the system has reached the 
crisis stage. Because the financial imbalance is reduced, the 
Colombian economy is now on a firmer footing and its 
possibilities of development have therefore improved. 
  Henceforth, the system will begin to generate foreign 
exchange, resulting in substantial savings. The counterpart of 
these higher reserves will be more productive capital and an 
acceleration of economic development. 
  The program contains two negative aspects that reflect the 
determination of some to block and obstruct in various ways the 
vigorous development of the pension funds, turning the "grand 
reform" into a "minireform" at all costs. One way is the 
exaggeratedly long transitional period provided for maintaining 
the existing system. The other is discrimination against workers 
who join the funds. 
  Rules for the transition will practically exclude from these 
funds all women over the age of 35 and men over 40. With respect 
to discrimination, it was stubbornly established that workers in 
the lower-income brackets who transfer to the pension funds will 
be required to pay into them longer than they would into the ISS 
in order to be guaranteed a minimum pension. 
  Nevertheless, despite the law's numerous requirements that 
are aimed at preventing the emergence of a strong pension fund 
system, I believe the funds will offer workers a far more 
attractive combination of profitability and service than what we 
have at present and that in the final analysis, the market will 
demonstrate its superiority. The future is upon us!

  [Text] Approximately 2,500 men, who in the past fought as 
armed rebels and clashed with the law, will now be enforcing the 
law. 
  The head of the DAS [Administrative Department of Security], 
Fernando Brito Ruiz, yesterday revealed the start of an 
ambitious plan to incorporate those ex-rebels into rural DAS 
units all over Colombia. 
  The official said yesterday that they have reached an 
agreement with organizations of former rebels all over Colombia, 
which clearly establishes the commitment that the ex-guerrillas 
will now have to the state and this investigation organization. 
  Former combatants will be given highly specialized training 
covering investigation, law, and democracy before being assigned 
to rural DAS units all over Colombia. 
  The program is based on the knowledge of these areas that 
the 
former rebels acquired during their antigovernment activities. 
  DAS sources said the program is designed to boost 
effectiveness in obtaining information, which should generate 
better results in the fight against subversive groups. 
  "We are being very careful," said Brito, "about giving them 
good training and maintaining good control. The status of their 
activities and the responsibility of each of these men must be 
very clear." 
  The official also said that leaders of the demobilized 
groups 
have made direct commitments to the DAS about supervising the 
activities of these new rural detectives. 
  The DAS said the leaders will monitor the situation of each 
of the former rebels, and said that "when a situation arises 
that is not very clear, they will bring it to the attention of 
the government or of the organization." 
  Brito also said that at the present time 150 former 
guerrillas who have been demobilized are working to protect 
their own leaders. These men were trained by the DAS for this 
program. 
  The DAS director stated: "Now we are going to begin a rural 
security program that we will implement through a reasonable 
process of explanation, training, and evaluation of the 
aptitudes of the ex-rebels." 
  These men will be subjected to intensive counterintelligence 
scrutiny in order to minimize the risks of infiltration by 
subversive organizations operating in Colombia.

  [Text] Mexico City, 13 Jan (EFE) -- Today, Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina said he has never heard multipartyism 
discussed at Cuban Government meetings because it is an issue 
that is "not very serious" and "lacks importance." 
  "Our meetings are characterized by their substantial 
agendas; 
there is no time for such unimportant issues," Robaina said in 
the second part of an interview published today by EL SOL DE 
MEXICO. "Thoughts about multipartyism are not among our 
country's many priorities at this time," Robaina added. 
  Asked if there has been any reaction within the government 
to 
exiled Cubans' statements supporting multipartyism, the Cuban 
foreign minister responded: "From the time I began participating 
in the meetings, an issue of such little importance has never 
been on the agenda. The historical reasons that joined us into a 
single party are stronger today than ever." 
  Robaina asserted, "There used to be multipartyism in Cuba 
and 
all those parties did very little to resolve the considerable 
problems our society had experienced for over half a century."

<F P=106> [Roberto Morejon commentary from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] At this time of necessary changes, Cuban labor 
unions are pushing to become the vanguard in adapting the Cuban 
system to the very unfavorable international context, and they 
are doing this by promoting internal reorganization of the 
nation's finances. The union movement advocates doing away with 
formalism, and it supports a more realistic look at problems and 
their possible solutions from the perspective of the workplace, 
as well as from a nationwide point of view. A recent editorial 
in the weekly TRABAJADORES, mouthpiece of the labor unions, 
called for the elimination of ritual and repetitive language. 
It asked for an end to the constant use of triumphant arrogance 
during everyday work at the unions' grass-roots level -- a level 
that includes factories, workshops, and service centers. 
  TRABAJADORES attacked the use of what Cubans call "teques." 
This means using propaganda slogans instead of objectively 
analyzing the problems affecting any given daily situation. 
"Teques," according to the weekly, is the corruption of 
revolutionary language. It called on the unions to move into an 
offensive mode and leave behind the habit of forever waiting for 
guidance from higher up while deficiencies continue to grow at 
the workplace. The call for a more specific analysis of the 
problems affecting a certain work center and the country in 
general is consistent with the nationwide effort to face the 
economic crisis provoked by external forces in a way as 
realistic as possible. 
  The same weekly had previously called on workers to fight 
for 
social equality and to banish egalitarianism practices of years 
gone by. These methods had such a negative effect that they 
managed to neutralize the workers' enthusiasm to produce more 
and better products. The current trend is to consider equality 
as a beautiful humanistic ideal and also as a condition for 
economic development. 
  Now, more than ever before, Cubans believe it is time to do 
away with idealistic practices and to cautiously apply the 
socialist principle of distribution of wealth according to the 
quality and quantity of work performed by each individual. In 
this context, it should be understood that if work does not 
become the true gauge with which to measure merit and, in turn, 
measure each worker's standard of living, current deterrents to 
production and efficiency will prevail. 
  The Cuban unions will support the socialist formulas 
designed 
to increase work results and will have greater participation in 
the decisionmaking process in this area. Whenever this does not 
occur, it will be the workers themselves who will demand the 
unions assume their rightful role.

  [Text] The workers of the National Agricultural-Livestock 
Projects Enterprise [Empresa Nacional de Proyectos 
Agropecuarios] in Ciego de Avila has argued in favor of the 
strategy of preserving the accomplishments of socialism amid 
measures to give new impetus to the economy and streamline the 
nation's finances. At what constituted the first base-level 
assembly of the province's workers movement, the 80 workers of 
this center came out in favor of continuing to provide free 
public health and education services, among others. They all 
agreed, however, that there had to be an end to inflated 
personnel rolls, and that direct production labor had to be 
increased. They explained that excess personnel should accept 
offers of new jobs that offer a minimal salary guarantee. 
  The assembly also came out in favor of changing the currency 
as a way to streamline finances, and of confiscating the 
property of so-called "profiteers" [macetas].

  [Text] There are perspectives for certain sectors of the 
national economy to begin recovering in 1994. This was stated by 
Politburo member Carlos Lage during a visit to Ciego de Avila. 
[Words indistinct] has demonstrated its capability to resist and 
its conviction to maintain the principles of socialism. 
  [Being Lage recording] I believe that the perspectives have 
to be seen not only in the context of one year but in the next 
few years. I believe the country has all the possibilities so 
that [words indistinct] begin and develop in the next few years. 
It will be -- I would add -- a slow recovery. It will be a step 
by step recovery. 
  The difficulties are great and the resource limitations are 
severe and will continue in 1994. The resources for 1994 are 
closely tied to the result of the last harvest, which was 4.27 
million tons of sugar, and these resources seriously affect the 
preparation of the resources with which the economy has to 
operate in 1994. Therefore, we have to be aware that this is 
also going to be a very difficult year, a year filled with many 
difficulties. However, we think that this year certain 
activities of the economy might begin to experience a better 
situation. 
  Of course, in the conditions our country lives, we have to 
to 
make all these projections keeping in mind that there are 
factors we cannot control, which are not dependent on our 
possibilities. After losing our highly stable foreign economic 
relations, we are dependent on sugar and oil world market 
prices. The conditions of the blockade give our economy very few 
opportunities to protect itself from price factors. 
  Keeping in mind the conditions in which we are beginning 
this 
year, we believe that certain activities might begin to recover, 
such as the sugar industry. I believe that we will overcome the 
special period being more efficient, more aware of the 
conservation of resources, and with more rationality. [end

  [Text] Madrid, 14 Jan (EFE) -- Cuban Vice Foreign Minister 
Isabel Allende admitted in Madrid today that her country needs 
to make changes to resolve its economic crisis, as long as there 
is a consensus by the people. Allende emphasized the need to 
safeguard Cuba's independence. She pointed out "We need to make 
those changes but the first thing that has to be taken into 
account is the people's opinions." 
  The Cuban vice minister for European affairs arrived in 
Spain 
on Tuesday and will visit until 21 January. Among other 
matters, Allende will make preparations for Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina's visit to Spain scheduled for the end 
of March. 
  In Madrid, Isabel Allende met with Yago Pico de Coana, 
general director for Ibero-America, and with Jose Luis Dicenta, 
state secretary for International Cooperation, with whom she 
discussed the follow-up work of the joint scientific-technical, 
cultural, and educational commission. 
  Allende, who said that Cuba has heard opinions on how to 
deal 
with the economic crisis, described the document published 
yesterday in Madrid's EL MUNDO newspaper as "fictitious" 
[apocrifo]. It stated that Cuban President Fidel Castro 
rejected the application of reforms proposed by former Spanish 
Economy Minister Carlos Solchaga. According to the newspaper, 
described by Allende as "a series of ridiculous things," 
Solchaga, in a secret report drafted after a trip to Havana, 
proposed a rapid transition to capitalism, which Castro rejected. 
  Allende also denied that Yago Pico de Coana handed her, as 
EL 
PAIS published yesterday, a list of prisoners of conscience that 
the Spanish Government would like freed before Robaina's visit. 
"We discussed Robaina's visit; there is no new list," Allende 
stated. He stressed that this question (the alleged list of 
prisoners) did not occupy even one moment of our conversation." 
[no opening quotation marks as received] 
  "The Cuban foreign minister was invited by his Spanish 
colleague Javier Solana. The government has not set any 
conditions for Robaina's visit," she said. "I believe the visit 
is important, but it is not something extraordinary; it will be 
a working visit and bilateral relations, among other things, 
will be discussed," Allende said. 
  Regarding the departure from Cuba of Alina Fernandez, Fidel 
Castro's illegitimate daughter, the Cuban diplomat said that "it 
has not had any special repercussions; we do not normally 
prevent people from leaving. Many people depart Cuba and Cuban 
migration is a topic that is manipulated extraordinarily," 
Allende added and admitted that "there are many people who 
migrate from Cuba in search of better living and working 
conditions." 
  The vice minister announced that Cuba is preparing for a 
meeting with the Cuban community abroad that wants to cooperate 
with the government's current project. 
  On the topic of the U.S. blockade, Allende pointed out that 
the Cuban Government has never offered anything in exchange for 
an end to the blockade, "because it is illegal." Nevertheless, 
she added, right now there is a "less aggressive language" 
between the two countries. 
  Regarding the peasant and Indian uprising in the Mexican 
State of Chiapas, the diplomat stated that "we are interested in 
a strong Mexico, without social conflicts, and we want 
everything to work the best possible way."

  [Text] Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Isabel Allende today 
described the bilateral relations between Cuba and Spain as good 
and constructive. Vice Foreign Minister Allende who is on a 
working visit to Spain said that, as in every relation, the 
parties involved have differing views on some topics, but the 
important thing is the attitude assumed to overcome the 
differences and difficulties. During her stay in Madrid, Isabel 
Allende met with high-ranking Spanish Foreign Ministry officials 
with whom she discussed bilateral matters such as the progress 
being made by the joint scientific and cultural and technical 
and industrial commissions. Allende also talked about Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's upcoming trip to Spain. 
Robaina was been invited to visit the country by his Spanish 
counterpart, Javier Solana. 
  Many Madrid newspapers today reported on Vice Foreign 
Minister Allende's visit to Spain. The fact that the newspapers 
covered Allende's visit has been interpreted as a sign of 
interest in the island which has opened up to foreign 
investment, mainly Spain's. In response to questions asked by 
reporters about the blockade, Allende said that this U.S. 
measure against Cuba is illegal, that it violates international 
laws, and denies the precepts of a market economy, which is 
based on freedom of trade, enterprise, and navigation. Allende 
also admitted that since President Bill Clinton assumed office, 
a less aggressive language toward Cuba has been evidenced; 
however, this does not mean that their policy toward the island 
will change. Allende, who is currently visiting the Cuban 
consulates in Barcelona, Vigo, and Sevilla, will return to the 
island next week.

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces, today in Cienfuegos attended the 
event marking the beginning of this year's defense training in 
the central territory. On behalf of the commander in chief, the 
Central Committee, the government, and on his own behalf, Raul 
Castro thanked the people for what they have done, and continue 
to do, in the defense of the fatherland. Manuel Menendez 
Castellanos, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in 
Cienfuegos, summarized today's events. He said that the central 
territory surpassed its tunnel digging plan by 105 percent. 
During the event, the five most outstanding municipal general 
staffs in the area received awards. These municipalities are: 
Jovellanos, Matanzas Province; Camajuani, Villa Clara Province; 
Cumanayagua, Cienfuegos Province; Yaguajay, Sancti Spiritus 
Province; and Majagua, Ciego de Avila Province. 
  During his visit to Cienfuegos, Army Gen. Raul Castro said 
that the result of the work done represents tons of sweat of 
millions of combatants, militiamen, and members of the 
production and defense brigades. In statements to Radio Reloj, 
Raul said that despite the situation confronted by the country, 
the men and women who make up the Army are aware that the sole 
goal of their effort is to prepare for war and to avoid war. 
Raul Castro described today's event, which was held in an area 
near the Jaime Gonzalez Airport, as one filled with emotion, 
patriotic, profound, and revolutionary. Following the event, 
Raul attended a meeting at the Camilo Cienfuegos Military 
School, where the participants discussed the results of the 
Central Army's 1993 defense training and the guidelines for 1994. 
  [Havana Radio Rebelde in Spanish at 1800 GMT on 14 January 
carries a similar report, but adds that Division General Joaquin 
Sola, chief of the Central Army, also attended the event.]

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro, second secretary of the 
Communist Party of Cuba and minister of the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces [FAR], has congratulated the Eastern Army for its 
accomplishments in 1993, when it upheld the status of the best 
command of the FAR. This was stated during the ceremony marking 
the beginning of the Eastern Army 1994 defense training year 
held at military unit No. 2034 in Las Tunas Province. This was 
due to the fact that this unit and its members performed in an 
outstanding manner in the province and earned the title of best 
for 1993. Division General Ramon Espinoza Martin, member of the 
Central Committee and chief of the Eastern Army, stated that 
this command, in addition to staying at the national vanguard in 
defense tasks, attained first place in the Eighth Science and 
Technology Forum.

  [Text] As announced, we now feature the statement Army 
General Raul Castro made to reporters following the ceremony 
marking the beginning of the Central Army defense training year 
in Cienfuegos. 
  [Begin recording] Despite the special situation the country 
has been enduring for several years and which you know about, in 
the last three years -- to speak in concrete terms -- the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces, the Interior Ministry, and the 
entire gigantic force of militiamen, [words indistinct] the 
great army of the people which will be the ones conducting the 
doctrine of the war of the entire people are aware....[changes 
thought] Despite this, I repeat, everything we do despite the 
situation, all the sacrifices, and our limited resources, we 
continue to develop -- from the people's tunnels to the medium 
and large tunnels, which are part of the preparation of the 
theater of military operations, part of the entire gigantic 
effort by our people. All this has grown despite this situation, 
and there is one single goal: To prepare for war precisely in 
order to avoid war, which is our dearest hope. 
  Once we said in a meeting that the most beautiful battle or 
the greatest victory our people can attain is precisely avoiding 
war, which for us -- we have said this before -- is the same as 
to have won it. [end recording]

demanded that TV Marti, the anti-Cuban television station, be 
closed. The association has described the station as 
inefficient and illegal. In statements to a special U.S. 
Congressional body, created to study the future of TV Marti and 
Radio Marti, (William Haratuntam), adviser to the National 
Association of Broadcasters, said that TV Marti violates the 
international agreements that limit the use of radio and 
television signals for domestic use only. The so-called TV 
Marti and Radio Marti have been on the air since May 1985 and 
March 1990, respectively.

  [Text] Harare, 15 Jan (AFP) -- Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina, who is currently in Harare, reacted with 
annoyance to the Spanish Government's demand that Cuba free six 
political prisoners before Robaina's next visit to Madrid in 
March. 
  "We do not make visits conditional upon someone being 
released," the Cuban foreign minister told AFP upon arriving in 
Harare, the third leg of his African tour. 
  He declared that he was not aware of Madrid's effort but 
added: "I believe there is someone interested in certain cases 
in Spain." 
  "The Spanish leaders have enough relations and experience to 
know how we have studied and treated this type of case in recent 
years," Robaina continued. "First, it would be necessary for me 
to personally receive their request so I can later tell them 
what I think of it." 
  Last Thursday, Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana gave 
Isabel Allende, Cuban deputy foreign relations minister, a list 
of prisoners accompanied by a request for their release. 
Allende is on a working tour of Spain.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikola Vadjon] </F>
  [Text] Luanda, 15 Jan (EFE) -- Cuba does not maintain 
"even remotely" secret relations with the United States other 
than the existing contacts, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina said today in Luanda. 
  The Cuban diplomat was interviewed by EFE before leaving the 
Angolan capital, where he was received by President Jose Eduardo 
Dos Santos and high-ranking officials of the government, 
parliament, and the government's Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola (MPLA). 
  "Current contacts between Cuba and the United States are 
limited to immigration talks, which have not reached a 
stalemate; certain Coast Guard-border guard contacts; some joint 
operations against drug traffickers; and a telecommunications 
deal that is at a deadlock," Robaina said. 
  Roberto Robaina emphasized that the new element in 
Cuban-U.S. 
relations "is that (President Bill) Clinton's administration has 
yet to use the aggressive language that characterized relations 
between the two countries during Republican administrations." 
  "Even though that doesn't mean much, it is something that 
may 
surprise certain people," Robaina said, adding that, personally 
speaking, he would rather not become "overly enthusiastic." 
  The Cuban foreign minister said he is frequently asked if, 
as 
head of Cuban diplomacy, he does not feel some frustration 
because some of Cuba's hopes have not been fulfilled -- meaning 
the normalization of relations and a suspension of the economic 
embargo imposed 30 years ago by Washington for ideological 
reasons -- with the arrival of the Clinton administration. 
  Robaina said: "I feel no frustration whatsoever, because, 
personally speaking, I made no plans beyond what is happening 
and because I understand that the new U.S. Administration is not 
what it really wants to be." 
  The Cuban diplomat thinks President Clinton is being subject 
to heavy pressure, above all from the most "reactionary" members 
of the Cuban community in the United States, who preclude any 
constructive steps toward Cuba. 
  Without mentioning U.S. black leader Jesse Jackson's recent 
visit to Cuba, the Cuban minister, who is visiting Angola for 
the first time since he replaced Isidoro Malmierca in the post 
last year, admitted that "there are other nobler areas" where 
work can be done concerning the United States. 
  He said the goal is to create an appropriate atmosphere to 
someday allow the emergence of much more important elements of 
the U.S. people and to encourage the normalization of relations 
between these two countries, which are separated by a mere 150 
km of sea. 
  Robaina said Latin America and Cuba are no longer a 
"priority" for the U.S. Administration, although he admitted 
that the situation could change given the complex international 
situation. 
  The minister said Cuba is willing to talk about the 
normalization of relations if the United States does not come to 
the negotiating table with "conditions or stipulations," adding 
that no one in his country would accept "subordinate conditions." 
  "We are prepared to discuss any topic (with the United 
States) because we believe anything can result if we talk about 
any given issue," Robaina said, but our "independence, 
sovereignty, and ability to state our own opinion" will not be 
on the negotiating table." 
  The Cuban diplomat said negotiations concerning the 
normalization of relations "should not begin with the most 
complicated issues," because an appropriate atmosphere must 
first be created. 
  Robaina said that Cuba believes that "nothing has been 
gained" by submission. "Life gave us the privilege of seeing 
that those who began by giving in were compelled to continue 
down that road, even when they had little left to give." 
  Moreover, Robaina said that during his visit to Angola his 
hosts told him about the current peace talks in Lusaka between 
the government and the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola (UNITA) guerrilla forces. 
  He said they also analyzed the possibilities of increasing 
cooperation between Luanda and Havana "on a new basis." 
  Robaina, who has already visited Ghana, today traveled to 
Zimbabwe. He will later visit Zambia and Namibia. 
  Over 350,000 Cubans went to Angola over a 15-year period as 
part of the so-called "internationalist missions." 
  Cuba withdrew its troops from Angola after signing 
tripartite 
agreements in New York in 1988. The agreement did not bring 
about a normalization of relations with the United States, one 
of the guarantor countries.

<F P=106> [Roberto Morejon commentary from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Nova Scotia Prime Minister John Savage said upon 
arriving in Havana last Monday that he was heading a delegation 
of representatives from 17 firms for the basic purpose of 
discussing trade. Upon ending the visit, however, Savage said 
it had met and surpassed his goals. 
  Savage and his entourage were received by Cuban President 
Fidel Castro, and Savage showed his great sensibility as a 
person and a doctor. He was impressed with the Cuban people's 
determination to move ahead and overcome the current economic 
crisis. Savage, who won the post of prime minister for the 
Liberal Party last May, presides over the government of a 
province of the Canadian Atlantic Coast, 80 percent of which is 
forest land. The province has great hydroelectric potential and 
is noted for its fishing. 
  The experience of visitors in this area will serve to 
promote 
the recently signed fishing accord with Cuba as well as to 
analyze additional operations. Not only did both parties sign 
accords on fishing, but Canadians and Cubans established a 
passenger cruise service for tourists. They also decided to 
create a mixed enterprise to produce soap, and Cuba agreed to 
purchase Canadian wood while Nova Scotia will receive Cuban 
citrus. 
  In addition, Savage and his delegation showed interest in 
the 
current transformation process of Cuban agriculture, evaluated 
the prospects for greater Canadian participation in mining, and 
drafted other mixed enterprise projects with Cuba. 
  Savage termed the visit by he and his entourage as 
advantageous and very fruitful. For Cuba, it represents an 
opportunity to expand ties following the loss of its traditional 
commercial partners. 
  This visit, the first to Cuba by a Canadian provincial prime 
minister in 17 years, also contributed to coordinating future 
cooperation in developing ecological tourism, one of the basic 
objectives of tourism in Cuba, which has been given priority by 
the authorities. 
  The contacts proved that the relations initiated have 
potential to expand to such areas as culture as well as to 
increase in the areas of economic associations and investments. 
The businessmen from Nova Scotia and other Canadian regions are 
not prepared to lose the commercial opportunities offered by 
Cuba, which represent mutual benefits, at the hands of increased 
U.S. pressure to frustrate any commercial negotiations to which 
Cuba is a partner. 
  We cannot forget that the Canadian Government maintains a 
respectful attitude toward Cuba, that the island represents its 
fourth largest trading partner in America, and that 22 of the 
112 commercial associations operating in Cuba with foreign 
capital are Canadian.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina </F>
in Angola by Radio Rebelde reporter Jose Mejia -- live] 
  [Text] [Mejia] I appreciate Celia Guido's help in making 
this call. Exclusivo Program listeners, we have made direct 
contact with Angola. To be more specific, we have made direct 
contact with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina who is at 
the Presidente Meridian Hotel in Angola. Robaina arrived in 
Angola yesterday as guest of the Angolan Foreign Ministry. 
  Comrade foreign minister, what are you and your delegation 
doing on this visit to five African countries. We know that you 
started your tour in Ghana on 11 January, that you are in 
Angola, and that you will be visiting other African countries. 
This is a live interview on Radio Rebelde's Exclusivo Program 
in Havana. 
  [Robaina] This visit to Angola is part of a tour that began 
in Ghana. Our visit to Angola ends tonight; as a matter of fact 
the visit to Angola will end in a few hours with a news 
conference we will hold at the airport prior to departure. We 
are leaving in the morning for Zimbabwe. From there we will go 
to Zambia and then Namibia. After Namibia we will be headed 
back to Cuba. We are all anxious to be back home. 
  This tour, as we have said, is also an offensive we have 
launched. We have come here to explain our situation. We have 
come here to explain the problems our people are confronting and 
how we are solving them. We carried out a similar task in Latin 
America and in the United States as well.[as heard] We are here 
at the invitation of several African foreign ministries. 
  [Mejia] I see. 
  [Robaina] On an African tour we could not overlook a visit 
to Angola. Angola is very important for Cuba. Strong ties and 
historic ties link us to Angola. 
  We have fulfilled a broad program. Our greatest success, 
what I consider to be the most important, is that the 
governments, the press, and the solidarity associations have 
given us the necessary space to talk about what we are doing in 
Cuba and what motivates us to resist and to seek solutions to 
the problems we confront. Above all, this visit has allowed us 
to learn first hand of what is going on in our Africa. I am not 
saying my Africa because it is our Africa as a result of the 
ties that join us. It has been hard work. However, the work our 
people are doing back home is even harder than the work we are 
doing. No number of meetings, interviews, can compare to the 
work our people are doing at home. 
  [Mejia] Foreign Minister Robaina, you are back in Angola. In 
1989 you were in Lubango and (?Kahama). Does this visit mean 
something special for you? 
  [Robaina] Yes. This visit is special for Cuba, the Foreign 
Ministry, and for me in particular. I cannot forget that the 
most important part of what I have learned in life was learned 
in this country. I am speaking of my military life. The 
experiences I shared in Angola with Cuban and Angolan youths 
have a very special meaning for me. I have seen many of the 
people I met during those difficult and complex times. This is 
something that one does not forget that easily, and something 
that I do not plan to forget. Quite the contrary. 
  [Mejia] Comrade foreign minister, I know there is a six- 
hour time difference between Havana and Angola. At this very 
moment it is 0124 in Angola. Please tell us how the Angolan 
press has covered your visit to Angola. 
  [Robaina] The press is a faithful reflection of our visit. I 
have found much understanding and respect. Many people are 
interested in learning what is happening in Cuba. I think that 
it is important that our people know that we have many friends 
here. The situation the Angolans are confronting domestically is 
very difficult, and they admit it. However, they trust that 
they can overcome these problems. The Angolan people, leaders, 
and the president himself have wished the best for the people of 
Cuba. I am leaving Angola much more convinced that our 
commitment is not only with the 10 million inhabitants of our 
island; our commitment is also with many honest men and women of 
this world -- honest men and women on this continent and in 
this country. They respect us. They agree that Cuba, despite 
the difficult times it is experiencing, should be allowed to 
speak and be heard. 
  [Mejia] Thank you very much, Foreign Minister Robaina.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in 
Zimbabwe today on a three-day visit. This visit is the third 
stage of a tour he is making of five African countries. 
  Robaina was met at the airport by (Estanislus Chiwedere), 
permanent secretary of the foreign ministry, who highlighted the 
two nations' common interests. In his welcoming speech, this 
high-ranking official said he was welcoming the representative 
of a nation that has shown solidarity toward Zimbabwe ever since 
Zimbabwe was struggling for independence, and with which (?it) 
shares many positions. 
  Robaina, for his part, said his visit was in response to the 
interest in explaining how his people live and work and in 
exchanging mutually beneficial experiences. 
  Robaina had earlier been in Angola, where he had talks with 
high-ranking Angolan officials. Those talks have been described 
as very fruitful. Shortly before leaving Angola, the Cuban 
foreign minister held a news conference. Here, from Luanda, is 
journalist (Issac Nenei). 
  [(Nenei)] -- live] As we said, he left Luanda this morning 
on 
his way to Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, continuing his 
diplomatic offensive through southern Africa. Namibia and Zambia 
will be the last countries he visits. The objective of this 
visit is, as we have already said, to explain what is happening 
in Cuba and, at the same time, to find out what is happening in 
this part of the world. 
  [Begin recording] [Robaina] I am really leaving with the 
satisfaction of having been able to carry out, in a short time, 
an intense program. But I am also leaving with the satisfaction 
of now being highly informed, and brought up to date, about a 
reality that my people follow very closely. 
  We Cubans follow very closely what happens in Angola; and, 
truly, since we know that the Angolans also follow very closely 
what happens in Cuba, we have tried to give them as much 
information as possible. 
  [Unidentified journalist, speaking Portuguese] What does 
Cuba 
expect (?to obtain) from Angola and other African countries? 
  [Robaina] Cuba expects from Angola and other African 
countries what we expect of the world. And although some may 
think that what we expect from Angola and the world, or of any 
country in particular, is the solution to our 
problems....[rephrases] Please, the solution to Cuba's problems 
depends first of all on the Cubans themselves, and on a 
mechanism that Cuba maintains with many in the world. Cuba 
expects, from Angola and from the world, what Cuba also 
advocates for the world: understanding and respect. Simply that. 
  [Unidentified journalist, speaking Spanish] As regards the 
crisis Angola is experiencing right now, Robaina, who is a 
member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, said 
that the Cuban people hope Angola will solve its problems [word 
indistinct]. [end recording] 
  [(Nenei)] From Luanda, this is (Issac Nenei) for the 
National 
Radio Newscast in Cuba. 
  [In a similar item, Radio Havana Cuba in Spanish on 16 Jan 
at 
1300 GMT reports that Robaina said that Cuba wants to establish 
stronger economic ties with various countries as part of its 
policy to neutralize the effects of the U.S. blockade and the 
collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe. 
  Robaina said Cuba is seeking mutually beneficial 
cooperation, 
a principle that is the basis for the country's opening to 
foreign capital and the establishment of joint enterprises. In 
statements to the media, Robaina rejected reports of a possible 
barter of Cuban weapons for Angolan petroleum. 
  Robaina will head for Zambia and Namibia following his visit 
to Zimbabwe].

<F P=106> [Report by (Africano Neto) from Angola -- live or recorded] </F>
  [Text] Radio Rebelde listeners, greetings from Luanda, the 
capital city of Angola. 
  Reactions to Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's visit 
to Angola continue to be heard. The Angolan media continue to 
report on the importance of Foreign Minister Robaina's 
statements during a news conference on 15 January, moments 
before leaving for Harare, Zimbabwe. Asked to describe the 
relations between Cuba and the United States, the young foreign 
minister said: 
  [Begin Robaina recording] You can describe relations between 
two countries when relations exist. When there are no relations, 
you cannot describe them. There are no relations between Cuba 
and the United States. Since there are no relations between Cuba 
and the United States, relations such as the ones we enjoy with 
Angola and many other countries, I can say nothing about them. 
The U.S. issue always seems to come up, wherever Cuba goes. 
However, I am always willing to discuss this issue. As far as 
Cuba is concerned, the U.S. foreign policy has not changed. We 
are convinced that Latin America and Cuba are not priorities for 
the new U.S. Administration. The U.S. Government has many 
domestic problems it must solve, and it is being pressured 
domestically to ensure that it will not normalize relations with 
Cuba. 
  Regarding the United States, Cuba will reiterate what it has 
always said. Cuba is willing to sit down and talk with the whole 
world, as well as with the United States. However, this is based 
on one thing: absolute respect. If absolute respect does not 
prevail, then we have nothing to say to the United States. If 
they want us to sit at a negotiating table as subordinates, we 
will not go. We are willing to broach the most difficult issues 
-- we are even willing to begin discussing the less complicated 
issues -- as long as there is absolute respect. Cuba is begging 
no one to talk to us; Cuba is imploring no one to talk to us. 
Cuba simply states on what basis it is willing to talk. If this 
condition is respected, then we would have no objection to 
sitting down to talks. 
  The only sign of interest we detect in the new U.S. 
Administration is the fact that the new U.S. Administration does 
not use the aggressive language used by previous U.S. 
Administrations. I do not think this is much. It could be 
something, and perhaps something may come of it, but there is no 
reason for us to be overjoyed. [end recording] 
  This was what Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told local 
and 
foreign reporters during a news conference held at the Luanda 
International Airport shortly before leaving Angola. Robaina 
said that Cuba will not negotiate as a subordinate. 
  Robaina also answered other questions for the reporters. One 
question had to do with the vast political, economic, and social 
changes being made in Cuba. Robaina also mentioned that the 
Cuban people are allowed to possess dollars. Robaina said: 
  [Begin Robaina recording] Cuba is undergoing very important 
changes. We would have to define what big changes really are. 
Big changes can be interpreted in one way or another. I believe 
the situation is extremely difficult and complex. We are 
undergoing a process of industrial change as well as changes in 
our foreign economic relations. We are doing this in the short 
term. Doing this in the short term has been extremely complex. 
Our task is more difficult because we are doing this amid a 
brutal blockade, harassment, and relentless persecution. 
  Regarding unrest, I am happy to say that we are a people who 
enjoy great calm. We have political discussions. We are 
currently undergoing strong political discussions. My country is 
currently facing difficulties and making changes; therefore, it 
is only natural that there should be discussions and very 
difficult times. However, I do not believe that the 
decriminalization of foreign currency is the most difficult 
issue we have broached. There are many other more important 
things we have discussed. For example, the economic changes we 
are undergoing. Some of these economic changes are: foreign 
investment, giving land to peasants and workers in exchange for 
their work, self-employment, and decriminalization. All these 
things must be discussed. Whenever so many topics are broached, 
various opinions will be expressed. However, the most important 
thing is that we are capable of doing this and we are doing 
this. This is the situation we are currently experiencing in 
Cuba. 
  Cuba chose to follow a path. We believe that even though the 
world we live in is a difficult world. We believe this world has 
changed. Cuba, however, will join that world. Cuba is willing to 
join that world without giving up certain principles. Cuba will 
not negotiate its sovereignty and independence, and we will 
never give up our right to be heard. We will not take steps 
backward in the fields of education, health, science, social 
security, and social justice. We will not negotiate those areas 
where we have made important progress. [end recording] 
  These were statements by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina during a news conference held on 15 January in Luanda. 
Robaina said that Cuba will not negotiate such fields as health, 
education, culture and sports, in which important progress has 
been made.

<F P=106> [Report by PRENSA LATINA correspondent Eduardo Rodriguez </F>
from Harare] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina delivered a message 
from President Fidel Castro to Zimbabwean Acting President Simon 
Muzenda. Muzenda and Robaina held a short meeting at the 
Zimbabwean Executive Offices in Harare. 
  With this meeting, Robaina began the third and last day of 
his official visit to Harare. Robaina arrived in Harare on 
Saturday from Angola. This visit is part of a two-week tour of 
the African continent. The head of Cuban diplomacy will travel 
to Lusaka, Zambia tomorrow and from there to Namibia, the last 
leg of his tour, which also included Ghana and Angola. 
  Foreign Minister Robaina also met today with Zimbabwean 
Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira. Shamuyarira described 
relations between Cuba and his country as excellent and 
expressed his hopes that bilateral exchange will be 
strengthened. The Zimbabwean foreign minister recalled that Cuba 
had done much for Africa, and that now the African countries 
must offer their support to a country facing difficult times. 
The Zimbabwean foreign minister encouraged an increase in 
contacts between the ruling ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African National 
Union-Patriotic Front] and the Communist Party of Cuba and 
expanded cooperation and commercial exchange in other areas.

<F P=106> [Report by Josefa Bussi] </F>
  [Text] The highest government and party leaders have said 
that 1993 was the most difficult year for our country. The lack 
or absence of basic products and services and the excess of 
currency, among other problems, affected the people and boosted 
black market activities, discouraged people from going to work, 
and created an overall high degree of social indiscipline. As a 
result of this and other problems, by mid 1993 the difficulties 
worsened and crime, in all its forms, increased, as did enemy 
activities and vandalism. In light of this situation, the 
mechanisms of the Sole Surveillance and Revolutionary 
Combativeness System were reactivated at all levels. 
  In Havana, where more than 30 percent of the crime occurs, 
more than 2,700 citizens were arrested, representing more than 
84 percent of the cases brought to trial. One of the most 
frequent crimes that affected the people the most was the 
stealing of bicycles. The number of these crimes has dropped 
significantly, especially in Havana Province, City of Havana 
Province, Sancti Spiritus Province, and Matanzas Province. 
According to specialists of the National Revolutionary Police 
General Directorate, the number of crimes, such as assaults, 
forceful entry, and cattle rustling, and other economic crimes, 
has dropped. Likewise, homicide and assaults have decreased. 
  Although, after analyzing some of the statistics resulting 
from the work done by the Sole Surveillance System with the 
support of the people, we cannot say that there has been a 
decrease in crime, I do agree with the specialists that criminal 
activity has been curbed and that the people are more secure. 
  We are beginning 1994, a year in which the causes for crime 
will continue. Therefore, it has become necessary that in 
addition to the preventive and coercive measures being 
implemented, the causes for crimes be pinpointed and alleviated 
so that the revolutionary and hard working Cuban people will 
remain secure, something to which they have been accustomed for 
the past 30 years.

  [Text] The resources which the State Committee for Labor 
and Social Security has allocated for pensions, retirement 
benefits, and loans for 1994 is approximately 1.8 billion pesos. 
This figure surpasses the 1993 expenses, which benefited over 
1.383 million people despite Cuba's dire economic difficulties. 
Social Security accounts for the biggest portion of the expenses 
and recipients since it includes pensions, retirements, disabled 
workers, and maternity and sick leave. The loans to low income 
people, including single mothers and the elderly who receive 
these benefits in the form of food and services, surpassed 36 
million pesos in 1993.

  [Text] Social Security subsidies are a guarantee 
consubstantial with the humane nature of the Revolution and the 
life-long dream of several generations. This is why they will 
never be eliminated. This was explained in the newspaper 
TRABAJADORES, which also explained the difference between 
subsidies to enterprises and social security benefits. The 
newspaper stressed that subsidies are given to state enterprises 
to make up for losses and drops in prices. Social security 
subsidies, on the other hand, are money allowances given to 
workers when they are disabled, either temporarily or partially, 
due to illness or accidents.

  [Text] Kingston, Jamaica, 15 Jan, CANA -- Jamaica and 
Guyana are exploring ways to strengthen cooperation between the 
two countries in trade investment promotion. 
  The state news agency Jampress said the effort, which will 
include joint projects between the two nations, was the focus of 
discussions between Jamaica's foreign affairs and foreign trade 
minister, Dr. Paul Robertson and Guyana's trade, investment, and 
tourism minister, Michael Shree Chan, this week. 
  Robertson pledged Jamaica's support for Guyana's efforts to 
develop trade and investment promotion mechanisms and to 
cooperate in other areas of natural interest in the economic 
sphere. 
  The two ministers discussed the long-standing relations 
between their two nations and economic measures being undertaken 
to liberalise their economics and gear them to meet the 
challenges of the new global economy.

  [Text] Roseau, Dominica, 15 Jan, CANA -- Dominica has not 
decided which candidate it will support in a late March vote for 
a new secretary general of the Organisation of American States, 
according to Foreign Minister Brian Alleyne. 
  He told the Caribbean News Agency Dominica might go it 
alone, even though it was fully supportive of the strategy of 
using the Caribbean Community bloc vote to influence events at 
the international level. 
  "Dominica is still undecided," he admitted. 
  This followed reports that Caricom is throwing its weight 
behind Costa Rica's Foreign Minister Bernard Niehaus, for the 
post of secretary general of the OAS, to succeed Brazil's Joao 
Clemente Baena-Soares. Miguel Angel Burelli-Rivas of Venezuela 
is the other known candidate. 
  According to Alleyne, the government here is still 
considering which way its vote will go at the March 27 special 
General Assembly when the new secretary general will be elected. 
  "Our concern here is the interest of Dominica, and we're 
very conscious, very aware of the positions of various Latin 
American countries on the banana issue, which is a critical 
issue for the future of Dominica, the economy, and the life of 
its people," Alleyne said. "We have great difficulty supporting 
countries which have shown a total disregard for these crucial 
interests.... "Virtually every Latin American country, in fact, 
has taken a position which is contrary to our crucial interest." 
  He said Dominica had taken the opportunity at Caricom forums 
to emphasize this difficulty in supporting Latin American 
countries not sympathetic to Dominica's banana problems. 
Banana-producing Latin American countries are trying to gain a 
larger share of the European market, a move Dominica and the 
other Windward Islands fear might destroy the Caribbean banana 
industry.

<F P=106> [Article by Margarita Cordero] </F>
  [Text] About a million individuals capable of working are 
currently unemployed in the Dominican Republic. According to the 
population projections drafted in 1991, based on the data on the 
labor force in the Demographic and Health Survey (ENDESA-91), 
the total domestic population in the economically active 
category was about 3.7 million. Males accounted for 2.2 million 
of this figure, and females for 1.5 million. 
  There is no great variation in the unemployment situation 
between the rural and urban areas, although the percentage of 
the workers who are unemployed is slightly higher in the latter. 
  When the unemployment figure is broken down by sex, however, 
the women's situation clearly reveals their social 
disadvantages. While only 11 percent of the men are unemployed, 
this is the case for 46.7 percent of the female population. 
  And there is one fact that would be hard to believe if it 
were not well-documented. Unemployment is higher among those 
with high-school education than among those without. 
  The data in question are contained in the monograph entitled 
"The Labor Force in the Dominican Republic," edited by 
demographer Nelson Ramirez. This study was based on the results 
obtained in the Demographic and Health Survey carried out by the 
Institute for Population and Development Studies (IEPD), one of 
the entities of the Dominican Association for the Welfare of the 
Family (PROFAMILIA). 
  A novel method was used to measure the levels of popular 
participation in economic activities and the unemployment rates. 
In an approach different from those traditionally used, the 
ENDESA-91 included in the unemployed category "not only the 
individuals who were looking for work during a reference period 
(the week preceding the survey) and those who plainly declared 
themselves to be unemployed, but also all the individuals 
prepared to work for pay or profit." 
  With this approach, the survey regarded as unemployed all 
those individuals who want to work but were not seeking 
employment because of their conviction that they were unlikely 
to find jobs (a group with significant weight in the 
underdeveloped societies). 
  Thus the rates determined as a result of this study differ 
from those based on the figures in the population census. Nor 
are they the same as the figures obtained in the occasional 
manpower surveys carried out by government bodies and organs. 
  At the time the ENDESA-91 was completed, 67.9 percent of the 
population 10 years of age or older was included in the figure 
representing the total manpower available for the production of 
economic goods and services. Eighty percent of the men and 55 
percent of the women were included in this figure. 
  All of the figures agree in showing differences between the 
levels and forms of participation in economic activities between 
men and women. A breakdown by age shows that the rates of male 
participation are on "a very high level up to the ages of 50-54 
(and up to even higher age brackets in the rural areas), while 
the rates of participation for women begin to decline as of the 
age of 40." 
  The data pertaining to child labor, especially the 
employment 
of males, is pertinent. According to the ENDESA-91, "one out of 
every two boys between the ages of 10 and 14 is on the labor 
market." 
  The same high rates are seen for men 65 or more years of 
age. 
In this bracket, six out of every 10 are still economically 
active. In the rural areas, the figure is seven out of 10. 
  "The shortcomings from which the socioeconomic systems in 
general, and the educational and social security systems in 
particular, are suffering" constitute the corollary. 
  In terms of education as a condition for participation in 
economic activity, the differences between men and women become 
significant. While for males "the level of economic 
participation seems to be independent of the number of years of 
study completed, a clearly defined positive relation is seen for 
the female population in this regard. The higher levels of 
participation in the labor market correspond to higher levels of 
education." 
  Although significant, the unemployment rates for men and 
women obtained in the ENDESA-91 survey are less dramatic than 
those based on the traditional methods of measuring this 
phenomenon. 
  Naturally, the study warns that these more positive rates 
pertain exclusively to occupational levels "and not necessarily 
to the quality or productivity of the work done." 
  In this connection, the possibility that "within a context 
of 
increasing social crisis and serious deterioration of the 
purchasing power of the population, larger population segments 
have been forced to enter the labor market--even if only by 
means of self-employment in marginal activities--in order to 
cope with this situation" is noted. 
  A similar inference might be made for the female population. 
If there is no visible impact on the rates of participation as a 
result, the explanation might be that the increase in the level 
of employment "is concealed within the much larger increase in 
the labor force (and in the number of unemployed workers)," or 
is obscured by the new conceptual method used to describe the 
economically active population (EAP). 
  Although an increase in the employed population (for both 
sexes) has been seen in recent decades, the increase between 
1981 and 1991 has been by far the most notable. 
  The other side of the coin, that is to say unemployment, has 
afflicted urban males more than those in the rural sector, while 
the situation is the reverse for females. 
  "In connection with these figures, it should be noted that 
in 
both sectors and for both sexes, the clear unemployment picture 
for the younger population segment is much more serious than the 
situation of those in the middle or older age groups. In fact, 
the rates are relatively low for men over 30." 
  The fact that individuals with less education have a lower 
rate of unemployment than individuals with a high-school 
education might be linked with the fact that the former group is 
"more urgently forced to engage in self-employment in informal 
activities as a strategy for survival." 
  However, a comparison of the individuals who have had a 
high-school education with those who have university backgrounds 
shows a more positive balance for the latter. According to the 
ENDESA-91 survey, the reason for the difference is to be found, 
on the one hand, in the fact that individuals with a university 
education have a greater need to work in order to pay for their 
studies. And on the other hand, the incorporation of a large 
number of the individuals who have completed professional 
training in productive activity is "facilitated by the level of 
training achieved and the greater readiness of these individuals 
to work." 
  In studying the unemployed population (those seeking jobs or 
wanting to work), the ENDESA-91 found that "23 percent had been 
in that situation for one month, another 27 percent for between 
one and five months, and 9 percent for between six months and a 
year, while the remaining 41 percent had been unemployed for a 
year or more (two or more years for the majority)." 
  Finally, the survey pointed out that this last percentage 
(individuals unemployed for a year or more), which is made up 
principally of the majority segment of the unemployed not 
seeking work, provides an indication of the rigid nature of the 
supply of productive jobs."

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Mercedes Feliz] </F>
  [Text] In the first nine months of this year, the Income 
Tax (ISR) Office collected 3.5365 billion pesos, representing an 
increase of 16.5 percent over the comparable period in 1992. 
  According to the figures provided by this office for the 
period between January and September last year, the sum 
collected came to a total of 3.035 billion RD [Dominican pesos]. 
  The Income Tax Office has estimated the total to be 
collected 
throughout the year will be 4.1879 billion RD, so that only 
651.4 million RD remain to be collected. 
  The sums collected are obtained from the income tax imposed 
on natural persons, companies, supplementary remuneration, and 
withholding agents; from the general sales tax and the tax on 
services; from inheritance and gift taxes; and from the taxes on 
housing and luxury premises. 
  In the period between January and September of 1993, the 
total collected from natural persons came to 51.2 million RD. 
This figure was down 41.5 percent from that for the comparable 
period of last year, when the total collected was 87.6 million 
RD [sic]. 
  This was the only category in which the sums collected 
showed 
a decline during the first nine months of this year. 
  From January to September of 1993, 1.3808 billion RD was 
collected from companies. This sum represents an increase of 2.7 
percent over the figure for the comparable period in 1992, when 
the total collected was 1.344 billion RD. 
  During the first nine months of this year, the sum collected 
from supplementary income was up 150.7 percent, with an increase 
from 6.5 million RD for the period between January and September 
1992 to 16.3 million RD for the comparable period in 1993. 
  Between January and September of this year, withholding 
agents contributed 977.5 million RD, representing an increase of 
15.2 percent over the figure for 1992, when the total was 666.6 
million RD. 
  The total obtained from all income categories was 2.426 RD, 
up 15.2 percent from the 1992 total, which was 2.1049 billion RD. 
  The general sales tax brought in 1.0794 billion RD in the 
period between January and September of this year. This 
represents an increase of 18.6 percent over the figure for the 
comparable period in 1992, when a total of 909.4 million RD was 
collected. 
  The Income Tax Office collected 15.4 million RD in 
inheritance and gift taxes. This represents an increase of 71.1 
percent over the figure for the comparable period in 1992, when 
the total came to nine million RD. 
  The tax on housing and luxury premises contributed 15.5 
million RD in the period between January and September 1993. 
This represents an increase of 33.6 percent over the figure for 
the comparable period last year, when the sum collected was 11.6 
million RD. 
  Where the ITBI [general sales tax] is concerned, the 
authorities have emphasized the need to take action against the 
businesses that are collecting this tax from the customers but 
failing to pay it into the treasury. 
  This branch of the Secretariat of State of Finance has 
indicated that it is setting in motion a program designed to 
effect direct control at the sales outlets of the establishments 
suspected of concealing the sums they are taking in.

  [Text] The ad interim Prime Minister Robert Malval is 
unable to assemble his ministers. According to an informed 
source, the government is reportedly immobilized due to Mr. 
Malval's inability to assemble a majority of the government's 
members. At least six members of the team that resigned 15 
December have reportedly refused to participate in the ministers 
council convened by Robert Malval. 
  This situation involves the ministers who dissociated 
themselves from Mr. Malval following the leak of a letter 
addressed to the president of the Republic, Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. The government is reportedly unable therefore to take 
measures to execute decisions related to certain day-to-day 
matters of state.

  [Text] As of 13 January in the Haitian parliament, it is 
Frantz Robert Monde, author of the clean-sweep policy [politique 
de la table rase] who now occupies the position of head of the 
Chamber of Deputies. 
  Monde, who has coveted the presidency of the chamber since 
the beginning of the legislature, has acquired the post thanks 
to a compromise by the socialists, and by members of the 
Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, ACP, to the detriment of 
outgoing President Antoine Joseph of the Movement for the 
Establishment of Democracy in Haiti. 
  The National Front for Change and Democracy [FNCD] 
parliamentarians admit that they are dissatisfied with this 
choice. In the opinion of some, this election confirms the 
strong tendency toward the clean sweep prevailing in the 
Chamber. Difficult days are expected. Bob Monde is a resolute, 
avowed, fierce opponent of exiled President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. Several FNCD and centrist parliamentarians say they 
fear the future with such a choice. Bob Monde will be assisted 
by socialist Mac-Ferl Morquette as vice-president. It is 
Emmanuel Reyme, the Haitian Christian Democratic Party man, 
another fierce opponent to the exiled president, who has been 
elected first secretary. The ACP has thus resumed control of the 
chamber.

  [Text] Haitian citizens met in a national committee for the 
resolution of the crisis and plan to go into the streets on 21 
January in order to require the forming of a government of 
national agreement and the lifting of the embargo. The 
committee threatens to invest an executive [words indistinct] if 
its demands are not taken into account. After 28 months of 
murderous crisis, says the committee, the solution is the 
streets, asserting that it is possible to have the unfair 
punishment inflicted by the international community on the 
Haitian people stopped through nonviolence. According to the 
committee, it is not good to witness the collapse of our social 
and cultural life, of our national economy, and of the actual 
and daily sacrifice of many thousands of Haitians. The 
committee hopes to mobilize all vital forces of the nation 
throughout the nine geographic departments of the country.

  [Excerpt] The news this morning is the total uncertainty 
regarding Army participation [in the Miami conference]. Also, 
there is no official representation of the Chamber of Commerce 
of Haiti and of the private sector in general, hours from the 
opening of the conference convened by the president-in-exile. 
Great confusion appeared to prevail on 13 January regarding the 
participants. However, according to Ambassador Jean Cassimir, 
everything is ready for the inauguration of the work meetings, 
which will last three days. 
  The American special representative on the Haitian crisis, 
Ambassador Lawrence Pezzullo, and the OAS secretary general will 
attend the meetings. Rothschild Francois, Jr. reports live from 
Miami: 
  [Begin Francois recording] Good morning! It is at the 
Intercontinental Hotel, located in the middle of Miami, where, 
tonight at 2000, the international conference convened by 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide opens. The participants will 
tackle the crisis in Haiti, the human rights situation and the 
problem of the refugees. 
  President Aristide arrived in Miami the afternoon of 13 
January and will open the conference tonight. 
  The international personalities who will take part include 
OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena Soares, mediator Dante 
Caputo, representatives of the Four Friends of Haiti and the UN 
secretary general, and Lawrence Pezzullo, American State 
Department special envoy on Haiti. 
  On the Haitian side, the Army will probably be absent from 
this conference as well as the private sector. According to 
information collected on the spot in Miami, this conference 
should in principle gather the majority of the sectors in favor 
of President Aristide. 
  According to the agenda issued by the Haitian Embassy in 
Washington, the conference will really start on 15 January with 
a speech by the OAS secretary general, who will talk on 
democracy and the OAS. 
  On his part, President Aristide will discuss the restoration 
of democracy in Haiti. Mediator Dante Caputo will also be 
invited to speak on 15 January. 
  The participants will then gather in workshops. They will 
have to speak on the implementation of the New York pact and on 
the contribution of the parties to the restoration of democracy 
in Haiti. Another workshop will analyze the subject of reviving 
the economy . 
  On Sunday, 16 January, the last day of the conference, the 
participants will raise the situation of human rights in Haiti, 
the social crisis, the crisis of the refugees, as well as the 
contribution of the parties to the restoration of democracy. 
The invited speaker is Jeremie Bishop Willy Romelus, considered 
a close supporter of President Aristide. 
  The closing of the Miami international conference is planned 
for Sunday night with a speech by President-in-exile 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. In Miami, the president's supporters 
have already mobilized. They intend to renew their support to 
the head of state by holding demonstrations over the weekend.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 17 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Frantz Robert 
Monde, recently elected Chamber of Deputies president, backed 
today the initiative of deposed President Aristide to form "a 
government of concord" and proposed summoning a national 
conference in Haiti. 
  "The meeting organized by President Aristide is a positive 
step in the search for a solution to the crisis but should be 
followed up with a national conference to take place in the 
country," explained Monde, a well-known neo-Duvalarist 
legislator. 
  In December President Aristide rejected a national 
conference 
in Haiti, citing inadequate security for participants. This was 
one of the most conflictive topics between Aristide and his 
prime minister, Robert Malval. 
  The Haitian conference held this weekend in Miami, Florida, 
to search for ways out of the political crisis in Haiti, 
concluded Sunday night with a call by deposed President 
Jean-Bertrand Artistide for the unity of the Haitian people. 
  The proposal by the Chamber of Deputies leader received the 
support of former Haitian President General Prosper Avril, who 
broke his long silence to ask that a national conference be held. 
  Avril, who had refused to summon elections during his term, 
was forced to leave power in 1989 due to U.S. pressures. 
  One of the recommendations of the Miami meeting that 
concluded last night is that the president should organize a 
national conference once he returns to the country. 
  Meanwhile, oil sent by the international community to Haiti 
last week has not yet began to be distributed. The oil is 
intended to allow humanitarian organizations to distribute 
medical attention to the most vulnerable citizens in the crisis. 
  Political observers in Haiti believe this situation is due 
to 
pressures exerted by the military and opposition sectors so that 
the international community will lift the oil embargo. 
  According to sources close to the military, the 
international 
community and the U.S. Embassy in particular are seeking an 
agreement with the military that could include the concession of 
part of the cargo. 
  The State Department and the United Nations have supplied 
different figures on the oil carried by the tanker. The State 
Department mentions 400,000 gallons of oil, while a UN spokesman 
has announced that the cargo amounts to 300,000 gallons. 
"Indeed, 400,000 gallons of oil had been requested, but after 
evaporation, less the oil burned during the voyage and during 
operation in port, the remaining oil could well be only 300,000 
gallons," explained Erick Falt. 
  Some observers believe that the 100,000 gallons that 
"evaporated" have been given to Police chief Michel Francois, to 
ensure his "cooperation" in the distribution of fuel to 
humanitarian organizations.

  [Text] Basseterre, St. Kitts, 17 Jan, CANA -- St 
Kitts-Nevis Prime Minister Dr Kennedy Simmonds has reiterated 
that his minority coalition government will not resign in 
response to opposition pressure to make way for fresh elections. 
  Speaking Sunday at a special convention of his ruling 
People's Action Movement (PAM) which forms the government with 
the Nevis Reformation Party (NRP), Simmonds said his 
administration would continue to promote economic development to 
make the twin island state a land of opportunity for all 
citizens. 
  General elections last November 29 produced no clear winner 
but PAM which won four seats -- the same number as the main 
opposition St Kitts-Nevis Labour Party -- teamed up again with 
the NRP which won one seat to form the government for a fourth 
consecutive time. 
  The Labour Party, which polled a higher percentage of votes 
than both partners in the coalition government, says PAM and NRP 
have no moral authority to govern and is continuing a campaign 
to force fresh elections. 
  Simmonds told PAM supporters his government was 
"constitutionally, morally and properly constituted" to run the 
affairs of St Kitts-Nevis. 
  "The opposition has the right to move a vote of no 
confidence 
in the National Assembly or demonstrate peacefully if they wish, 
but order must be maintained and the laws of the land will be 
respected," he added. 
  For a no confidence vote to succeed, Labour would need the 
support of the Nevis-based Concerned Citizens Movement which won 
two seats in the November 29 poll, but turned down approaches 
from both PAM and NRP to form a coalition government. 
  Simmonds said PAM was formed to unite the nation and erase 
what he said were the memories of victimization and suppression 
by the Labour Party when it was in government, especially 
against the people of Nevis. 
  He said his government would not be intimidated by threats 
of 
violence.

<F P=106> [Report by Corlita Ollivierre] </F>
  [Text] Kingstown, St. Vincent, 15 Jan, CANA -- Minister in 
the St. Vincent prime minister's office, Burton Williams, on 
Saturday announced he had tendered his resignation. Williams 
told the Caribbean News Agency he needed more time to take care 
of the organisation and development of his constituency, South 
Windward. The resignation was effective from Saturday, he said. 
  Williams was health minister until June last year when he 
was 
transferred to the prime minister's office after a crisis in the 
health sector. 
  He said he intends to contest the next general election, 
constitutionally due by the end of August. But it was unclear 
whether he would be a candidate for the ruling New Democratic 
Party. Williams, reported to be in the late 30's, went into 
politics in 1984. At the time, he was operating a taxi service. 
  On Friday, in a paid announcement on national radio, 
Williams 
stated his intention to be a candidate for the South Windward 
constituency which he represents in parliament. This followed 
months of speculation that Williams was among three persons who 
would be axed from the slate of candidates of the New Democratic 
Party for the next general election. 
  Williams, in the announcement directed to his constituents, 
termed the reports a malicious rumour "by persons intending to 
create division and confusion..." He continued: "I have no 
intention to, and will never ... Be ungrateful nor disrespectful 
to you all. I want you to understand clearly that I will be 
contesting the next general election on your behalf." 
  The three functioning parties here have not announced their 
candidates for general election, but the campaign unofficially 
kicks off on the electronic media this week with the beginning 
of weekly television appearances by the NDP. 
  The main opposition St. Vincent Labour Party has been having 
regular weekly broadcasts. Dr. Ralph Gonsalves' Movement for 
National Unity returned to the television screen Wednesday after 
a few weeks' break.

  [Text] New appointments within the Foreign Relations 
Secretariat were announced today by Foreign Relations Secretary 
Manuel Tello. 
  In his first news conference as foreign relations secretary, 
Mr. Manuel Tello stressed that Mexico's international policies 
will be carried out firmly and prudently. He offered to 
undertake initiatives which in addition to preserving Mexican 
sovereignty and promoting the country's interests, will also 
serve to strengthen Mexico's image throughout the world. Mr. 
Tello also highlighted Mexican determination. 
  [Begin Tello recording, in progress] ...the unmistakable 
prestige that Mexico has been able to establish over the years 
in the international community as a respected and respectful 
country cannot and will not be tarnished. [end recording] 
  Foreign Secretary Tello announced that in accordance with 
President Carlos de Salinas' instructions, several persons had

  [Text] In compliance with an order from the president of 
the Republic and supreme armed forces commander, the Mexican 
Army and Air Force will act as follows: 
  They will not open fire on armed groups unless they attack 
the Army or Air Force, directly endanger the civilian 
population, or try to return to towns or positions they 
initially occupied. Specifically, the Air Force will suspend its 
fire, except in cases of aggression against Army personnel who 
require its support in unpopulated areas. 
  They will continue to protect towns that requested their 
help 
to prevent possible attacks. They will not permit any movement 
by these armed people to areas outside the region. They will 
maintain the free mobilization of their personnel and equipment, 
including ground patrol and air reconnaissance. They will 
redouble their contribution to the government effort to 
distribute food, medicines, and other items which are basic to 
the affected population.

<F P=106> [Statement by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at </F>
Los Pinos Presidential Residence in Mexico City on 12 January; 
from the "24 Hours" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: After analyzing the security 
conditions prevailing in the municipalities that were assaulted 
beginning on 1 January by a group of attackers, National Defense 
Secretary General Antonio Riviello Bazan has informed me that 
the largest cities and towns where this group was present have 
already been placed under the control of the Mexican Army, 
thereby guaranteeing the tranquility of the residents of these 
communities in Chiapas State. 
  The Army has, therefore, achieved its first objective begun 
on the first of day of 1994, working within the framework of its 
constitutional duty and in response to the request of the 
Chiapas government to protect the civilian population and 
restore security in the state. 
  On the other hand, the changes made 48 hours ago at the 
presidential cabinet are permitting us to advance in the tasks 
aimed at promoting actions in favor of peace. The background 
and determination of the government secretary and the meeting 
between the commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas 
and various sectors have resulted in broad support for the 
measures that may end the confrontation. The Catholic Church, 
as a whole, has expressed its support, as have the members of 
other churches. 
  The presidential candidates of each of the political parties 
have pledged to work in favor of peace. The Special Commission 
of Senators and Deputies has expressed its decision to 
contribute to the elimination of violence as soon as possible. 
Different social movements, nongovernment organizations, the 
media, the country's most important trendsetters in public 
opinion, intellectuals, and citizens in general are in favor of 
the search for peace. 
  The government of the Republic is now taking a firm step. 
Once the security of the region and that of the very members of 
the Mexican Army has been guaranteed, while attempting to send a 
clear message of reconciliation, peace, and respect for human 
rights; taking into consideration the fact that the Mexican Army 
has already reached the first objective in its constitutional 
mission to guarantee the security of the region; considering the 
feelings and opinion of the country; and given the very 
conviction of the president of the Republic, I, in a responsible 
way, have decided to suspend armed actions in the state of 
Chiapas. The Mexican Army will guarantee the tranquility of the 
residents of these cities and towns. The Army will only respond 
if attacked. 
  If the armed groups do not end their aggressive actions, the 
Army will have to defend itself and defend the civilian 
population. Also, in this kind of situation, it is common that 
actions are carried out to achieve propaganda objectives. This 
cannot be ruled out, and we will remain alert. 
  By doing this, the president of the Republic -- the supreme 
commander of the Armed Forces -- is doing everything possible to 
seek peace seriously. The most urgent task is to create more 
room for reconciliation. I fervently hope that this decision of 
the government of the Republic, which has the support of all of 
society, is the first step toward saving lives and finding new 
means of reconciliation. We have the chance to find a solution 
that can show the extraordinary strength of Mexican society. 
This is a moment of unity necessary in overcoming a difficult 
situation. We will continue to bring relief and food to those 
affected by the confrontation. We will redouble attention given 
to the social demands of Indian communities, particularly those 
in the highlands and jungle of Chiapas, with their own 
participation. We will act to ensure that there is greater 
justice. 
  I also reiterate that those who have participated in the 
uprising because of pressure or desperation and who now accept 
peace and legality will be pardoned. This makes me confident 
that Mexico will come out stronger. Now let us all act in favor 
of peace and reconciliation. We therefore demonstrate, with the 
voice of a united Mexico, that the strength of peace is much 
greater than any violent group's capacity to do harm. Thank you 
very much.

  [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jan (DPA) -- The National Defense 
Secretariat today reported that the Mexican Army is heeding a 
unilateral cease-fire ordered by President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari in the conflict zone in the state of Chiapas. It 
pointed out that the Army and Air Force "will not open fire 
except against armed groups who attack them, who directly 
jeopardize the civilian population, or who seek to return to 
positions and towns they had occupied." 
  In an official communique, the secretariat added, "the Air 
Force, in particular, will cease fire except in cases of attacks 
on Army personnel in uninhabited areas where they require help." 
  President Salinas de Gortari had said he decided to "suspend 
all fire" in the conflict area because the Army already 
fulfilled "the initial goal" of its mission to restore control 
and security in the region. 
  In the communique, which was issued immediately after the 
presidential announcement, the Defense Secretariat pointed out 
that the troops "will continue to protect towns that requested 
help to prevent any possible aggressions." The communique said, 
"they will not allow these armed people to move outside the 
region," and it added, "they will maintain free mobility in 
terms of personnel and equipment, including ground and aerial 
reconnaisance operations."

  [Text] A news conference by Manuel Camacho Solis, 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas State, has 
just ended. At approximately 1230, Camacho Solis disclosed three 
points to reaching an agreement for normalcy, peace, calm, and 
tranquillity in this area. 
  He said the first step had been taken by the chief of the 
executive branch. This step consists of suspending any 
confrontation between the Army and the rebels. The second step, 
Camacho explained, is for all parties to join in a civic 
movement to lay the groundwork for negotiations. We then would 
go on to the third step, which will be the dialogue. 
  According to Camacho Solis, a great politician who favors 
dialogue, what is needed is a dialogue with the Chiapas 
guerrillas to discuss their viewpoints and demands and then set 
a deadline. With regard to a deadline, he noted that a deadline 
for the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] cannot be 
established yet because they are in no condition for that. He 
said all he wants is for the situation to move toward one of 
peace, tranquillity, and calm in Chiapas State. Camacho Solis 
said: We are certain that we are doing fine; we are on the 
correct path to reconciliation. 
  Camacho Solis is about to start a motorcade for peace. It 
will depart from San Cristobal de las Casas and go to Ocosingo, 
where heavy fighting with the EZLN took place. 
  During the news conference, Camacho Solis was accompanied by 
Bishop Samuel Ruiz and Armed Forces Commander Oton Calderon.

  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico, 12 Jan (EFE) -- The rebel 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) today threatened to 
occupy Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas State, and it called 
on the people to join its struggle. 
  The EZLN issued the warning in a communique released before 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced an 
unilateral cease-fire by the Army in Chiapas in an effort to 
achieve peace in the region. 
  "On 12 January, we will enter and seize Tuxtla Gutierrez, 
the 
capital of the state, and our comrades already located in 
different parts of the Mexican Republic will rise up until we 
achieve the overthrow of the evil government which has been in 
power for many years," the EZLN said in reference to the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
  Until noon today, there had been no clashes between the Army 
and the rebels in Tuxtla Gutierrez and calm prevailed in the 
conflict zone. 
  "It is deceitful that we are being controlled by foreigners. 
We are all 100 percent Mexican, and we are asking for justice 
for both us and our children," stated the rebel communique, 
which was issued to the local media. 
  Meanwhile, civilian sources stated that all roads in Chiapas 
State have been opened and that there have been no clashes or 
shelling within the past few hours. The last fighting occurred 
on the night of 11 January at Military Garrison No. 31 in Rancho 
Nuevo. It is unknown whether there were any casualties. 
  The Army has advanced up to the community of El Momon, some 
30 km from Guadalupe Tepeyac -- the last rebel stronghold in 
Chiapas -- where the Army will try to reestablish civilian power.

<F P=106> [Speech by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari </F>
during a signing ceremony for the Pact for Stability, 
Competitiveness, and Employment at Los Pinos Presidential 
Residence in Mexico City -- live] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: The fact that labor, 
peasant, and business organizations today reaffirmed their full 
commitment with the terms of the Pact for Competitiveness and 
Employment and agreed to strengthen and broaden it is of great 
importance. Today, you have shown more proof of unity and work 
in favor of Mexico's best interests. 
  For the nation, the pact means that the nation is moving on 
the path toward stability and growth. Moreover, it represents 
the efforts undertaken by each sector and each Mexican to help 
the country curb inflation, advance in the modernization of its 
industrial plants, and above all, give more attention to the 
most needy. 
  I must stress that inflation hurts most those who earn the 
least, and it shrinks the income of Mexicans. Now, after 
significant advancements, we have abated the most unjust tax to 
levels that for the first time will benefit more than half of 
the population -- young people who under the age of 25. 
  Therefore, with their work and commitment to the pact, the 
economic sectors have contributed to inspire in the Mexican 
people new hope for a better future. Today we have renewed our 
willingness to discuss our problems and reach concerted 
agreements within the law as the only path Mexicans accept to 
meet our challenges and advance toward our goals. Government 
actions have been based on this principle for more than five 
years, moving forward with a new outlook -- an outlook of 
discipline, tolerance, and a clear concept of social justice. 
  First, the agreement you have signed reaffirms the general 
guidelines and specific efforts previously agreed to in 
consolidating our economic and social advancements. 
  Second, within the framework of the policy of fiscal and 
monetary discipline, the federal government commits itself to 
guarantee that the real increase in public expenses for 
employment and social programs -- which are very significant -- 
will reach the communities and the population more 
expeditiously. I must remind you that the government spends 
more now in resolving social problems because it maintains 
healthy public finances. As we have already announced, in 1994 
social expenses will surpass 50 percent of the government 
budget, almost 10 percent of the GNP. These are the highest 
figures in our history. In this manner, our social and economic 
policies are consolidated as a solid pillar of a broad and 
profound strategy for the benefit of those who earn less. 
  Third, the labor and business sectors -- within a framework 
of respect and solidarity, and, above all else, while taking 
into consideration the nation's best interests -- they are 
committing themselves to preventing and giving prompt solution 
to disputes that could emerge among the various productive 
forces. 
  Fourth, the agreement stresses the priority attention that 
Mexican rural areas deserve and will receive. We will continue 
working together to make sure that rural areas will receive 
opportunities and a dignified and productive way of life. 
  Finally, the various sectors that signed the agreement will 
have to work intensively, redoubling efforts. We will reinforce 
the established mechanisms in order to give the necessary 
follow-up to the acquired commitments, maintaining close 
communication among all economic sectors. 
  Today and here, we reaffirm our commitment to defend and 
consolidate what we have built with so much work and effort, 
always based on our pluralism, our solidarity, and always -- 
always -- based on the law. 
  Ladies and gentlemen: It is within the legal path that we 
will guarantee social peace and tranquillity in Mexican homes, 
as well as a just and sustained development for the benefit of 
all our compatriots. Following that path -- the path of the 
law, which benefits us all, because we must all abide by the law 
-- we will be able to advance in peace toward our objectives of 
growth and social justice. Thefore, at this renewed phase of 
the pact, we reaffirm our commitment with the state of law, 
which guarantees the defense of our most precious values. 
  There are serious problems we must face. At all times, 
however, it has been through concerted efforts and strict 
compliance with the law that the Mexican people have attained 
their goals. Let us clearly understand and remember that no 
problem, no matter how great or complex, is unsurmountable by 
itself. The government and society will continue working for 
the country's sovereign development with the unity of all 
Mexicans. 
  Therefore, today we again reaffirm our pride as Mexicans and 
our confidence in our future. Thank you very much. [applause]

<F P=106> [Pact for Stability, Competitiveness, and Employement read </F>
by Arsenio Farell, Mexican secretary of labor and social 
welfare, following the signing of the pact at Los Pinos 
Presidential Residence in Mexico City; broadcast in progress -- 
live] 
  [Text] ...competitiveness and employment. In light of the 
regrettable developments in the state of Chiapas and the illegal 
activities involving armed groups, the signatories of the 
Stability, Competitiveness, and Employment Pact agreed on the 
need to reaffirm, reinforce, and fully comply with the 
commitments acquired on 3 October based on the following: 
  1. That unified cooperation of all segments of the 
population, within a framework of respect and permanent 
communication, is an indispensable condition to reach common 
goals which will guide Mexico's progress, defend our 
sovereignty, and strengthen our national identity. 
  2. That reaching a consensus within the framework of the 
law, 
and not through confrontation, is an efficient instrument to 
coordinate society's efforts in tackling the challenges of a 
just and equitable economic development within a world situation 
that demands greater efficiency and competitiveness. 
  3. That the consensus reached and the efforts made by all 
segments have brought about specific and significant results, 
which we pursue. Inflation has been reduced to a single-digit 
figure, and productivity shows important and sustained growth. 
We have noted strict discipline in the handling of fiscal and 
monetary policy. We have made progress in economic deregulation 
and trade opening. We have created new means to ensure more 
active participation of private and social segments in economic 
activity, and we have made profound budget reforms that seek to 
make quicker progress in resolving the social underdevelopment 
that persists. 
  Therefore, the labor organizations that comprise the Labor 
Congress, the peasant organizations, the business organizations 
that represent a great majority of the country's productive 
forces, and the federal government agreed to the following: 
  1. The signatories ratify the commitments in the current 
consensus agreements and pledge to make greater efforts to 
comply, fully and in a timely manner, with each and every one of 
them within their own jurisdictions. 
  2. Within a context of fiscal discipline and in strict 
compliance with provisions of the federation's expenditures 
budget and the Revenues Law, approved by the honorable Congress 
of the Union, the federal government commits to establishing a 
timetable giving higher priority to the use of allocations that 
correspond to public investment expenditures to promote economic 
activity and those corresponding to social development 
expenditures. 
  These allocations increased by 10 percent and 10.5 percent 
in 
real terms, respectively, in the budget approved for 1994. 
Therefore, expenditures for social development represent 53.9 
percent of programmed expenditures and 10.2 percent of the GNP. 
These are the highest figures in our history. 
  3. The labor and managerial sectors agree to promote and 
increase, via every means available to them, a direct and 
permanent dialogue and an understanding among the production 
sectors to prevent and to expeditiously resolve any possible 
differences. They also agree to increase efforts to directly 
sign productivity and quality agreements between labor 
organizations and management in accordance with the guidelines 
of the national agreement to increase productivity and improve 
quality. 
  4. The labor, peasant, and managerial sectors, as well as 
the 
federal government, believe it is imperative to continue giving 
priority attention to the agricultural sector. With this in 
mind, they agree to strengthen their interrelation with the 
rural sector through productive chains in an effort to support 
their productivity and profitability and thereby improve the 
standard of living of people living in rural areas. 
  5. To guarantee that the goals established in this agreement 
will be met, the parties deem it necessary that, effective with 
the signing of this agreement, the sessions of the Follow-up and 
Assessment Commission will be held twice a week, on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays, instead of once a week, as has been the case up until 
now. 
  The social dialogue, in a climate of peace and national 
unity, and with the unavoidable respect for the law, has 
resulted in significant achievements. 
  The labor, peasant, and management sectors, as well as the 
federal government, believe that society's concerted efforts 
within the law are the most effective way to consolidate the 
achievements made in the struggle against inflation, as well as 
to consolidate the construction of a firm basis to boost growth 
and employment and to advance efforts to meet the needs and 
demands of our compatriots, particularly those who have less. 
  This pact is being signed at Los Pinos Official Residence on 
12 January 1994 in the presence of the president of Mexico.

  [Text] Foreign Relations Secretary Manuel Tello Macias in 
his first news conference said the events in Chiapas State have 
adversely affected Mexico's image abroad. Mexico was seen as a 
stable country where social stability prevailed, he said. Tello 
Macrias also said Mexico has not taken into consideration the 
possibility of requesting aid from the United States or any 
other government. Tello Macias said Peace Commissioner Manuel 
Camacho Solis is the only voice to explain what is being done, 
how it is being achieved, and what is expected of the 
reconciliation process. Let us listen to him: 
  [Begin Tello Macias recording] It would be advisable to 
avoid 
the proliferation of people playing the leading role in this 
situation. I believe it would be much better for the national 
and international public if there is only one voice. [end 
recording] 
  Manuel Tello described as serious the possibility that other 
governments are supporting the armed movement in Chiapas because 
they would be hurting the country's sovereignty. He said that 
even though there is no evidence, the Mexican Government does 
not rule out the possibility that non-Mexicans are participating 
in actions with the armed group. The Mexican foreign minister, 
who until a few days ago was Mexico's representative at the 
United Nations, said the Chiapas conflict adversely affects 
various sectors of the population but said it is no reason to 
paralyze the country.

  [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- The National 
Defense Secretariat [Sedena] reported today that the most 
important towns in Chiapas initially occupied by the armed 
groups have been recovered. Thus the first objective of the 
military operation "has been achieved." 
  In its Communique No. 14, Sedena states that by achieving 
this first objective, the Mexican Army has taken territorial 
control of the area in general and that civilian authorities 
have already begun exercising their responsibilities. 
  The text of the Sedena communique follows: 
  "In accordance with the planned operations as drafted by the 
7th Military Region Command based in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 
we have achieved the first objective of the operation, which is 
the recovery of the most important towns taken over by the 
transgressors, with the exception of Guadalupe Tepeyac, which 
should take place as soon as a large number of installations 
destroyed by the assailants on the various roads are repaired. 
  "In achieving this first objective, the Mexican Army has 
recovered territorial control of the area in general. Civilian 
authorities are exercising their responsibilities in all 
municipal capitals taken over by the assailants. No area of 
significance in the region is being occupied by these armed 
people, even though some isolated groups may still be operating."

  [Text] On the night of 11 January, the National Defense 
Secretariat issued Press Communique No. 13, explaining the 
missions conducted by military aircraft in the Chiapas conflict. 
The Defense Secretariat reports that up to now, operations by 
Air Force airplanes and helicopters in direct support of the 
ground forces are no closer than 5 km to the towns, so 
townspeople have not been harmed in any way. The communique 
adds that the aircraft have been used to transport troops and 
supplies. They have also been transporting food, medicine, 
clothing, and other articles to be distributed among residents 
of towns where military personnel are conducting activities to 
help civilians.

  [Text] At exactly 1630 [2230 GMT] this evening [12 January] 
a demonstration for peace in Chiapas State left the Revolution 
Monument and headed to El Zocalo Square in Mexico City. 
Thousands of members of people's organizations, independent 
worker's unions, political parties, student groups, and human 
rights advocates make up this enormous contingent. The 
demonstrators -- singing, chanting, and waving banners -- asked 
for a peaceful solution, not an armed solution, to the conflict 
in that region. They chanted: Peace yes, war no. 
  Traffic remains insane, mainly in downtown Mexico City, as 
groups of demonstrators continue to converge on the square. 
Fortunately, no serious incidents have been reported thus far. 
Security operations are being carried out by 600 units from the 
General Secretariat of Protection and Highways and coordinated 
with the District Judicial Police. As of this moment, no 
incidents have been reported. Main roads and avenues such as 
Paseo de la Reforma, Juarez and Hidalgo Avenues, Lazaro Cardenas 
and Francisco Madero Street, and others have suffered the 
consequences of the demonstration. It should be pointed out, 
however, that commuters have realized the significance of the 
grand demonstration and, instead of expressing their anger, have 
understood the message of peace for Chiapas. 
  The obvious roads have been blocked throughout the two hours 
of the demonstration, but alternate routes have also been 
overcrowded. The commentary here is that fortunately no 
incidents have been reported up to now, except for the heavy 
traffic, especially around this main square in Mexico City. 
Thousands of voices are calling for peace in Chiapas State. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 0056 GMT on 13 January transmits a 
150 word, Mexico City-datelined report that notes "more than 
100,000 demonstrators, according to observers, chanting 'Death 
to the Institutional Revolutionary Party' and 'Salinas is a 
murderer,' filled the plaza in front of the National Palace." 
The report also states that "the demonstrators paraded an 
effigy of Emiliano Zapata, crying vivas to Zapata and painting 
the Zapatista National Liberation Army symbol on walls as they 
marched." According to AFP, the crowd chanted "Death to the bad 
government," "cease the bombings," and "massacre or Indians," 
reminiscent of "the slogans used in Latin America during the 
1960's and 1970's."]

  [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jan (EFE) -- The clandestine Social 
Liberation Party, unknown until today, has threatened to kill 
five human rights organization leaders for not supporting the 
struggle of the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). 
  LA JORNADA newspaper reported today that it had received an 
anonymous telephone call, informing it of the existence of a 
message concerning the armed conflict in the southeastern state 
of Chiapas. The newspaper added that the message was later found 
on a utility pole on a Mexico City street. 
  The five threatened leaders belong to nongovernmental 
organizations and, according to the communique, are accused of 
"not supporting the armed struggle movement in Chiapas, and, in 
turn, they have betrayed the ideals of many struggling groups." 
  The threatened leaders are: Sergio Aguayo, president of the 
Mexican Human Rights Academy; Juan Carlos Martinez, coordinator 
of the Fray Francisco de Victoria Human Rights Center; Alejandro 
Camarillo, president of the Mexican Human Rights Commission; 
Fernando Ruiz Canales, president of the Law and Human Rights 
Council; and Victor Clark Alfaro, director of the Binational 
Human Rights Center.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Luis Armenta from the "Vector 21" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A group of legislators today presented to the 
Permanent Commission of Congress a report on the situation in 
Chiapas. The report was based on the group's recent visit to 
the state. 
  The two senators and 11 deputies who make up this group 
under 
the leadership of Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi pointed out that the 
Chiapas conflict emerged because of the state's long history of 
backwardness and various forms of domination that have retarded 
its full development. 
  The document says that in this state there are unacceptable 
examples of inequality and poverty. After reading the balance 
of the situation, Michoacan Senator Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi 
said violence in certain areas of Chiapas has become another 
element of destabilization. After reviewing the situation in 
Chiapas, the group of 13 legislators from the six congressional 
factions that make up the Congress drafted a 16-point proposal 
asking all sectors of society to contribute to the solution of 
the conflict. 
  When reading the document, Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi said 
the 
relations between the Federal Government and the state of 
Chiapas should be strengthened. A cease-fire must go into effect 
as a necessary condition for peace. The senator said criminal 
laws should be revised, especially criminal proceedings against 
Indians. Authorities must support the job being done by the 
National Human Rights Commission in the southeastern part of the 
country. There is also a need to review and speed up the 
processing of documents concerning the granting of lands, as 
well as other matters. Here are the statements made by Victor 
Manuel Tinoco: 
  [Begin Tinoco recording] The Plural Group [Grupo Plural] 
hopes Congress will continue to contribute to the resolution of 
this conflict with the consensus of all political parties, and 
it should draft an agenda of legislative proposals to contribute 
to this end. The possibility of learning about its results in 
subsequent periods should be left open. We ask that the 
Permanent Commission authorize the Plural Group to give a 
follow-up to the fulfillment and application of all these 
recommendations and proposals and the other actions and 
proposals brought forth by other national authorities concerning 
these same problems. [end recording] 
  Moreover, the board of directors of the Chamber of Deputies 
was installed a few minutes ago, following the Permanent 
Commission session. It will guide the work to be done during 
the special period of sessions to review and approve the bill 
for a general amnesty in Chiapas. Institutional Revolutionary 
Party Deputy (Juan Antonio Neme Dipp) was elected, and he will 
be the one to chair the board of directors at the Chamber of 
Deputies for this special period of sessions, which will begin 
today.

own home and let everyone have tranquility in his community. 
  The message goes on to say: There is a new governor. He is 
going to send his representatives to help you and your 
communities. Now is the time to work again in the [word 
indistinct], to take care of your families, and improve Chiapas. 
Chiapas is everything. Let us all make an effort to build peace

<F P=106> [Report by Alma Rosa Baez from Los Pinos Presidential </F>
Residence; from "Vector 21" newscast -- live relay] 
  [Text] Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas State, has disclosed that this 
afternoon he met at Los Pinos Presidential Residence with 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and the secretaries of 
government and defense. He pointed out that the government has 
decided to withdraw its troops from within the communities in 
Chiapas State and station them on the outskirts of the towns. 
Camacho said the troops will no longer be in the towns nor will 
they provide surveillance and patrols in cities or towns. The 
government has also decided that the humanitarian tasks the 
troops were carrying out, such as medical treatment and the 
distribution of food, will gradually be transferred to the local 
authorities, the Red Cross, and humanitarian organizations. 
  Camacho Solis said that these actions will contribute to 
detente in Chiapas State, adding that the constitutional 
government's goal is, above all else, to foster peace and 
reconciliation in the region. Camacho Solis said that in this 
way, the Mexican Republic will be strengthened. 
  [Begin Camacho Solis recording] With institutional strength, 
with a government that favors negotiation, and with an 
extraordinary consensus within civilian society in favor of 
peace, Mexico is not only capable of resolving the very 
difficult situation in Chiapas, and thereby avoiding the very 
high costs experienced by other countries, but it is also 
capable of taking new steps in favor of justice, respecting the 
Indians, creating broader opportunities for political 
participation, and supporting Chiapas State, as it has already 
begun to do. [end recording] 
  Camacho Solis declined to answer questions from reporters; 
he 
only read the communique. 
  Meanwhile, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has decreed a 
waiver and tax exemptions on various taxes, thereby providing 
Chiapas residents with administrative facilities. Taking into 
consideration that the state's economic situation is 
normalizing, and in an effort to ease the people's fiscal and 
administrative expenses, it has been decreed that, beginning 
this month and until June, income tax payments will be waived 
for taxpayers who are paid salaries, without affecting their 
right to receive in cash the funds they are due as credit on 
their salaries. Also exempted from tax payments are taxpayers 
whose homes or establishments are in the affected areas. Also, 
individuals who must file tax returns or pay federal taxes will 
be able to conduct those procedures and payments by 31 July 
without paying any fines whatsoever. 
  During the current fiscal year, there will be no charge for 
the issuance of nonimmigrant permits; this will benefit bus 
drivers and the operators of cargo and dump trucks at the Ciudad 
Hidalgo customs post in Chiapas State. 
  Among the municipalities that will benefit from this decree 
are Altamirano, Ocosingo, San Cristobal de las Casas, Comitan, 
Las Margaritas, La Independencia, Chanal, Oxchuc, Chilon, Pueblo 
Nuevo Solistahuacan, and San Juan Cancun. 
  This decree, which will be published in Friday's edition of 
the Official Gazette, states that these actions are aimed at 
restoring order and harmony in Chiapas State. 
  I would also like to comment that about one hour ago, 
approximately 40 community representatives from Chiapas State 
arrived at Los Pinos Presidential Residence. They are holding a 
private meeting with President Salinas and I am waiting for them 
to emerge to talk with them.

  [Text] Mexico City, 20 Jan (EFE) -- The rebels who staged 
an armed uprising in Chiapas State on 1 January can benefit from 
an amnesty that was approved today by a plenum of the Mexican 
Chamber of Deputies, as long as they suspend their violent 
actions as of today. They will only benefit from the amnesty if 
they surrender their weapons and release the hostages they are 
holding, and they must adhere to the terms established by the 
commission that is going to implement the law. 
  In addition to sending the amnesty bill to the National 
Congress, President Salinas appointed Manuel Camacho Solis as 
the special commissioner to negotiate peace and to establish 
contact with the rebels in the Zapatist Army of National 
Liberation. The Amnesty Law suspends penal sactions against 
individuals who participated in the violent occupation of 
several towns in Chiapas and in later clashes with the Mexican 
Army. 
  The Chamber of Deputies received the bill and modified 
certain articles to make the deadline for the surrender of 
weapons more flexible and to establish that one condition for 
the surrender of weapons would be a willingness to enter 
negotiations. The bill originally established that the sole 
beneficiaries of the amnesty would be those people who 
participated in violent incidents between 1 January and 1100 on 
16 January if they surrendered their weapons and adhered to the 
benefits of this law. 
  The deputies added to the draft law an article that calls on 
the executive branch to create a commission that will coordinate 
the implementation of the law to strengthen legal procedures and 
to prevent setting deadlines that hinder the implementation of 
the law. The application of benefits of the amnesty will go into 
effect the moment the commission declares a definitive end to 
hostile actions. 
  Another change made to the draft law was the elimination of 
a 
30-day deadline and the inclusion of the delivery of hostages. 
Also, it emphasized that the people receiving benefits of the 
law will not be interrogated, investigated, summoned, or 
bothered, inasmuch as amnesty includes a respect for human 
rights. 
  The ruling explains that the Amnesty Law must be made public 
and disseminated in Spanish and in the nine indian dialects that 
are spoken in the area so that it will be learned as best 
possible by those for whom it is intended. 
  The armed conflict in Chiapas began on 1 January with the 
violent takeover of San Cristobal de las Casas, Ocosingo, 
Altamirano, Oxchuc, and Las Margaritas, from where the Armed 
Forces expelled the rebels who remain entrenched in the 
community of Guadalupe Tepeyac near the border with Guatemala.

  [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico (AFP) -- The 
"prior conditions" to begin a dialogue with the government have 
not been fulfilled "in their entirety," because the Army 
"continues to violate the cease-fire," the Mexican guerrillas 
stated in two communiques published in the local newspaper 
TIEMPO on Friday. 
  The documents, which AFP received tonight in advance, are 
addressed to Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho and Samuel Ruiz, 
bishop of this city. They note that the guerrillas have not 
received "any written communication" regarding the proposed 
amnesty announced last week by the government, which would cover 
rebel actions staged between 1 and 16 January. 
  In this regard, the rebels note that the "mentioned amnesty 
law" is "premature in the current dialogue process, because the 
political and social causes that gave rise to our movement still 
prevail."

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Santoyo from the "Panorama" newscast] </F>
  [Text] It was almost 1600, and the sun was hot and bright 
with only a handful of small clouds to reduce the extreme heat. 
The road was long and formidable. Nevertheless, it was well 
worth the effort to find those who just a few days earlier had 
laid siege to Ocosingo. After plenty of waiting and searching 
for signs of any member of the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN], we finally spotted a group of EZLN members 3 or 4 km 
ahead of us. We cautiously moved forward. Suddenly, as we 
neared them, someone blocked our path. There were four young 
men wearing the EZLN uniform: green shirt, brown trousers, and 
plastic boots. Their weapons were AK-47 assault rifles. 
  The question came immediately: What are you looking for 
here? You are taking a great risk. 
  We responded: We want to talk with you. 
  They answered: We will see if it can be arranged. We will 
ask our commander. 
  About 35 minutes later the answer came. Follow me, said one 
rebel. It is not too far. We walked for about 20 minutes under 
large shade trees. It was time enough to reach our destiny. We 
never knew his name, but he was in charge of the Ocosingo 
occupation. Although his Spanish was somewhat broken, his ideas 
were clear, especially the reason he is fighting. 
  [Begin unidentified rebel commander recording] My native 
brothers need land that they do not have. The land is there, 
but the landowners control it all. We need land, and besides 
the land, we also need fertilizer, machinery, and irrigation, 
just like the landowners have. 
  If the landowners have land, why can we not have the same? 
This is our question. For this reason alone, we are fighting 
for land. We are doing this to enable all native Indians in the 
Mexican Republic to have a place to live. We need homes, but 
not the homes we have now. They have no drainage, power, 
drinking water, or parks -- things that any human being desires. 
They pushed us up against the wall, and then they call us lazy 
and ignorant. If we are ignorant, it is because the government 
has kept us that way. [end recording] 
  When we asked about their strategy or their strength, their 
answer came immediately: That is a secret, but I assure you 
there are plenty of us. Those who are here, he said, are not 
here because we like it. For years, various candidates and 
their parties have passed through this area. They made many 
promises, but none of them have been fulfilled. Instead of 
dying of hunger or of some illness such as measles, cholera, or 
snake poisoning, we would rather die fighting by way of a 
bullet. We are tired of broken promises and empty words. 
  He kept his face covered with a ski mask, through which we 
could only see his honey-brown eyes. In his voice we heard no 
fear but, rather, bitterness from the years of destitution, 
persecution, and neglect. 
  [Begin rebel commander recording] We are not followers of 
Marxism-Leninism. Many simply do not know there is a Marx 
[words indistinct]. One does not have to be Marxist-Leninist to 
realize who is behind this government. One does not have to be 
poor or a big-bellied child to [words indistinct]. One only 
cries. One does not have to study works of Marx, Che Guevara, 
or others. [end recording] 
  This interview lasted some 45 minutes, and the EZLN rebel 
commander concluded by announcing that his forces will not lay 
down their weapons, despite the amnesty. He said the most 
important step the government must take is to do everything 
necessary to finish with the tyrants and exploiters of the 
Indians and peasants in the highlands of Chiapas. We said 
good-bye with a handshake and a thank you. Before we left, he 
warned us by saying that we had better leave early, because 
nobody knows what might happen in the late afternoon or at 
night. He added that we are more important alive than dead. He 
then turned away from us and walked into the dense jungle, where 
many have found not only danger, but also death.

  [Excerpts] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has 
appointed Beatriz Paredes Rangel president of the National 
Commission for the Overall Development of and Social Justice for 
Indian Peoples [Comision Nacional de Desarrollo Integral y 
Justicia Social para los Pueblos Indigenas], which was created 
by Presidential Agreement on Wednesday [19 January] as published 
in the official gazette. At 2000 President Salinas held a 
30-minute meeting with Mrs. Paredes and representatives of 
several churches, indigenous community leaders, prominent 
intellectual figures, authors, actors, and other Mexican 
citizens to install the advisory commission for the National 
Commission for Overall Development and Social Justice for 
Indigenous Peoples. The meeting took place in the Vicente 
Guerrero Room at Los Pinos, the official presidential residence. 
The advisory commission held its first meeting at Los Pinos, 
which lasted two hours, prior to meeting with President Salinas. 
[passage omitted] 
  President Salinas is scheduled to meet with 42 
representatives of more than 200 indigenous groups this 
Thursday. The official list of members of the National 
Commission for Overall Development and Social Justice for 
Indigenous Peoples will be completed in the next few days.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] In a plenary session of Congress, Mexican deputies 
and senators formally opened a special period of sessions in 
which the president's initiative to grant amnesty for violent 
actions in the Mexican state of Chiapas will be the only topic 
of discussion. 
  First, the Chamber of Deputies opened its session and 
elected 
by majority (Juan Antonio Memidip), PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] deputy for the state of Veracruz, as 
president of the special session. Before this, the Permanent 
Commission of Congress met briefly to receive the report from 
the commission of deputies and senators who traveled to Chiapas 
to study the conflict. Basically, the report, which was read by 
PRI Senator Victor Manuel Tinoco, indicates that the legislative 
commission learned about all of the demands of the people of 
Chiapas. They proposed that Congress continue to contribute to 
resolving the conflict and that all political parties draft a 
legislative agenda offering solutions. 
  The Joint Government and Constitutional Affairs and Justice 
Commission of the Chamber of Deputies met tonight to receive 
proposals from all political parties on the draft amnesty bill. 
This will permit them to draft a resolution that will be 
presented to the plenum on Thursday. 
  The proposals are varied and include: 
  1. The PAN [National Action Party] asked that those believed 
responsible for kidnapping and amassing weapons not receive the 
benefits of the amnesty. It also asked that the amnesty bill be 
publicized not only though the official newspaper but also 
through edicts in all places, both in Spanish and all dialects 
spoken in the region. 
  2. The Cardenist Front demanded that the amnesty not be 
limited to offenses committed after 1 January 1994, because 
several offenses were committed in late 1993. 
  3. The PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution], in addition 
to demanding that constitutional reforms be passed to offer 
integral solutions to the problems of the Indians of Chiapas, 
asked that first negotiations be held, problems be resolved, and 
then amnesty be offered. 
  4. The Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution proposed 
that no Mexican or foreign mercenaries be given amnesty. 
  5. The PPS [Popular Socialist Party] demanded that 
fundamental solutions be found to the Chiapas conflict, because 
an amesty law alone will not resolve anything. 
  All political parties agreed that terms for surrendering 
weapons must be eased and time must be permitted for 
negotiations. 
  Upon beginning its analysis of the draft amnesty bill, one 
of 
the first changes made by the Government and Justice Commission 
was to extend the deadline for crimes that qualify for a pardon 
from 16 to 20 January 1994. 
  The resolution on the draft amnesty bill will be ready 
Thursday morning, and if no changes are introduced, it will be 
immediately discussed at the plenum of the Chamber of Deputies.

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" of a news conference by Guatemalan President </F>
Ramiro de Leon Carpio on cabinet changes in Guatemala City on 19 
January; from the "Telepress" newscast; broadcast in progress -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] ...the task of directly studying and evaluating the 
performances of each of the state institutions, and as a state 
duty, I have been forced to make changes in the government 
cabinet which I consider necessary to strengthen or, as some 
news media have put it, to oxygenate the cabinet and government 
in general, thereby enabling them to function as a much stronger 
team. 
  Upon completing the necessary evaluations, I had to thank 
certain government employees for their cooperation, as in the 
case with Foreign Minister Arturo Fajardo Maldonado, who will be 
replaced by Marithza Ruiz de Vielman, based on her background, 
capabilities, and human and professional qualities. 
  In all the ministries I am going to mention, you can rest 
assured we conducted a flawless examination of the appointees, 
and that their appointments were based exclusively on the 
capabilities they have displayed in the numerous activities they 
have pursued, their qualifications, and especially their 
professional and human qualities and also, unquestionably, their 
performances in other disciplines or activities, public as well 
as private. 
  Engineer Oscar Armando Martinez Anaya, who was minister of 
communications, transportation, and public works, will be 
replaced by Eng. Jorge Erdmenger de la Fuente. The Economy 
Ministry, which soon we hope to be able to legally call by the 
name we are currently using, Foreign Trade Ministry, will be 
headed by Eduardo Gonzalez Castillo, replacing Fanny de Estrada, 
who resigned some time ago because of health problems. The 
Finance Ministry was and still is headed by Richard Aitkenhead, 
who presented his irrevocable resignation some time ago because 
he was appointed to an important position in an international 
organization. I spoke with Aitkenhead and after accepting his 
resignation I decided to replace him with Economist Ana Ordonez 
de Molina, who until now was executive secretary of the 
Presidency. Her appointment was based on the follow-up 
evaluation I referred to earlier. 
  As a strategy to strengthen the economic cabinet, Romulo 
Caballeros was secretary general of economic planning up until 
December. He accepted the position solely to participate in and 
cooperate with the government in the area of planning -- a 
mission he carried out perfectly because that institution worked 
with the economic cabinet on the 180-day plan and the 1994-95 
government agenda. Having fulfilled his goal, and since he is no 
longer with us, I have appointed Guillermo Rodriguez Magual as 
secretary general of economic planning.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 20 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Unidentified 
individuals detonated a bomb in front of the National Congress 
and another in front of the National Printing Press [Tipografia 
Nacional], injuring 18 persons early this morning, voluntary 
firemen reported here today. 
  The source indicated that the explosive device, which blew 
up 
in front of the Congress building at 0500 [1100 GMT], only 
caused property damage. 
  The source added that the other bomb blew up very early in 
the morning in front of the bus stop in the vicinity of the 
National Printing Press where 18 persons were seriously injured. 
  The firemen said the bomb that exploded in front of the 
Congress building contained high explosives but the one in front 
of the National Printing Press was a fragmentation grenade. 
  The attacks took place during an increase in Legislative and 
Executive Branch campaigns in favor of popular consensus and 
campaigns by radical groups and peasant organizations opposing 
the political event scheduled for 30 January.

  [Text] Security forces are investigating the explosion of a 
grenade thrown by unidentified individuals Wednesday night, 
which killed a child and wounded 17 other people. The forces 
also are investigating another explosion that did considerable 
damage to the Legislative Building and nearby areas. This is 
Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso. 
  [Begin recording] [Ortiz Moscoso] Perpetrators of this 
barbaric method will get nowhere. It is only a means of 
underscoring their personal positions. Printed materials found 
at the site of these explosions call on the people to imitate 
these rebellious groups in opposing the plebiscite. I think, 
however, that they are getting nowhere and will not get 
anywhere. The Guatemalan people are fed up with this type of 
tactic and violence. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What about the bomb thrown last 
night 
in front of the [words indistinct]? 
  [Ortiz Moscoso] That is something different. That was not a 
leaflet bomb. We are alarmed about this explosion. I visited the 
place at about 1930 on my way home after leaving my office. The 
police were there in force also. We want to capture these 
irresponsible, wicked people. This is the only way I can 
describe them. I must inform you and the general public of my 
grief on learning that a child was killed by the this morning's 
explosion. This blood must be on the head of the perpetrators. 
It is unthinkable that such people detonate grenades at a place 
where tired people are waiting to go home. 
  [Reporter] Can such explosions be regarded as attempts at 
destabilizing the government? 
  [Ortiz Moscoso] I would rather say it is an attempt at 
destabilizing the democratic system, which is different. The 
government is represented by President de Leon. Such an attack 
on innocent people cannot be understood to be an attempt to 
destabilize the government but as a direct attack on democracy 
and the Guatemalan people's desire to live in peace. [end

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Chiapas Ablaze"] </F>
  [Excerpt] It is the poorest and most backward area of a 
country that has become a very important U.S. partner. It is 
the most neglected state of the Mexican federation, even though 
in San Cristobal de las Casas, the first city the guerrillas 
took, an opera theater costing $10.5 million is being built. 
The theater will seat 1,000 persons and will have a concert 
hall and a parking lot that can easily accommodate 250 cars. It 
is an area that was only reached by the economic compensators of 
the Carlos Salinas de Gortari administration until after rumors 
of the existence of guerrilla groups became stronger. According 
to former Mexican guerrilla Gustavo Hirales, the Solidarity 
program arrived in Chiapas State overnight with its projects for 
dignified health and hospitals, dignified housing, children in 
solidarity, and so on. 
  Chiapas is also the area served by a bishop whom the Pope 
has 
asked to leave, charging him to be a follower of Liberation 
Theology. 
  This sums up what even the dullest observer believes has 
taken place in that remote Mexican area, where from 1 January it 
has been demonstrated that there are at least two Mexicos: the 
one the official publicity sells and endorses and the one that 
seems more like Central America than part of the northern 
continent. 
  But for those who look at the Chiapas uprising with greater 
interest from Guatemala, it is impossible not to notice other 
characteristics. 
  It is an area where the Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Unity (URNG) guerrillas move about practically with full 
freedom. It is an area where hospitals for wounded guerrillas 
have been built, there are safe houses for the Guatemalan 
guerrillas and even guerrilla recruiting networks in cities as 
close to the border as Tapachula. 
  This is the perspective from which the Guatemalan military 
intelligence, at least, observes what is going on in the Mexican 
State of Chiapas, which is ablaze. 
  Sources close to the Army admit that for over six months the 
second section (Second Directorate or G-2) had information on 
the activities of Mexican guerrillas. In fact, during a visit 
to Mexico City, Guatemalan officers offered to help in the 
investigations. When they received no reply they directly 
contacted the 24th Regiment in Chiapas. Nevertheless, the 
Mexicans hesitated in accepting their colleague's help. A few 
months later they appeared in Guatemala seeking the very 
information they had previously disdained. 
  Most of the information supplied to them showed a link 
between the Zapatist [Zapatist National Liberation Army -- EZLN] 
guerrillas and two Guatemalan guerrilla groups: the Poor 
People's Guerrilla Army (EGP) and the Revolutionary Organization 
of the People in Arms (ORPA). To the Guatemalan military, the 
Mexican rebels are very similar to the EGP in their Maoist 
leanings, their ethnic claims, and their preference for the 
"prolonged popular war" fighting modality. The Zapatists have 
taken great care to demand in their first war declaration the 
presence of international observers, respect to the Geneva 
Convention on the treatment of political prisoners, and the 
presence of the International Red Cross in combat areas, demands 
that have been made in the past by Central American guerrillas 
such as the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and the 
URNG. 
  According to analysts, as in the case of the EGP, the 
Zapatists have carried out spectacular actions to attract 
international attention to their demands. 
  The Guatemalan military officers identify the Zapatists with 
the ORPA because of the type of operations they carry out, such 
as blowing up bridges and attacks on Mexican Army troops in open 
areas. [passage omitted]

pact. The ceremony was chaired by President Carlos Menem, 
Governor Nestor Kirchner, and other government officials. Santa 
Cruz has thus become one more provinces that already has joined 
the government initiative, which initially was rejected by Santa 
Cruz officials. 
  President Carlos Menem said Catamarca also will sign the 
fiscal pact within the next few hours. The president said that 
perhaps this very afternoon Catamarca will sign the pact. He 
also expressed his satisfaction over the Santa Cruz decision to 
join the pact proposed by the national government.

  [Text] Today President Alberto Fujimori said he hopes 
Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for 
inter-American affairs, will verify the human rights situation 
in the country's interior areas. He said this after he 
inaugurated the Huamanga-Huanta road, a project requiring an 
investment of more than 3 million soles, in Ayacucho Department. 
  President Alberto Fujimori inaugurated 20 km of the 
Huamanga-Huanta road in Ayacucho Department. He was accompanied 
by (Pierre Ramba), UN permanent representative in Peru. This 
road represents a 3.3 million new soles investment and will 
allow trade in this area of the country to be stimulated. It 
includes the (Ayaorcuna), (Guaiguas), and Cusca bridges. 
  [Begin unidentified resident recording] We wish to express 
our deepest gratitude because we now know the jobs are being 
completed. [applause] [end recording] 
  In response to the residents' repeated requests, the 
president pledged to undertake the Rashuillca project, which 
will use lake water for irrigation. The president took the 
opportunity to briefly visit the Santa Clara Convent where he 
spoke with the nuns. 
  Alexander Watson was not present. President Fujimori and 
Ayacucho Bishop Monsignor Juan Luis Cipriani both agreed that 
the U.S. official should verify human rights accomplishments in 
situ and not from a desk. 
  [Begin Fujimori recording] I do not believe the human rights 
problem can be viewed simply from a desk, taking into account 
the partial speculation and information that reaches him. Human 
rights is an issue to be discussed here in Ayacucho, 
(Huancasanco), and Huanza, where there are so many orphans. 
Here, the Army, the Armed Forces in general, the peasant 
patrols, and the people have defended human rights. That is why 
we can talk of human rights now, and here human rights are 
respected because we have defended them. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Lima, 21 Jan (EFE) -- Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori has rejected a U.S. request that the Supreme Court 
review terrorism cases tried by military courts. 
  Fujimori, who met with Alexander Watson, assistant secretary 
of state for Inter-American Affairs, justified his refusal to 
accept the U.S. proposal by noting, as as an example, that the 
top Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman "could be freed for lack 
of evidence" should the Supreme Court review his case. The 
review of terrorism trials "is a risk we cannot accept in the 
same way that the United States would not accept it if it were 
in our situation," the Peruvian chief of state added. Fujimori 
pointed out that the Judicial Branch is not yet "completely 
reformed" and that the civilian judicial system "is no guarantee 
that human rights will be respected." 
  Fujimori and Watson met at the Government Palace in Lima. It 
was a "constructive and frank," meeting according to the U.S. 
government official at its conclusion. [passage omitted] 
  Fujimori, for his part, expressed his confidence that the 
meeting has served to "dispel the doubts" of the United States 
about the human rights and democratization process. 
  Regarding democratization, the chief of state said he told 
the U.S. official "that the Peru that existed before 5 April 
1992 was not viable and that the measures adopted had been 
necessary." According to Fujimori, this "was a topic that was 
well understood" by the U.S. Government representative.

  [Excerpt] President Alberto Fujimori has met in private and 
for almost two hours at the presidential palace's Grau Room with 
U.S. Undersecretary Alexander Watson. The U.S. official arrived 
at Pizarro's home [presidential palace] at 1025 with U.S. 
Ambassador Alvin Adams. Three important issues were discussed 
during the meeting: the consolidation of democracy, the 
strengthening of human rights, and cooperation in the struggle 
against drug trafficking. After labelling as positive the 
meeting with Watson, the president reiterated that the 5 April 
[1992] measures had been necessary to prevent Peru from being 
totally undermined. Here is what President Fujimori said: 
  [Begin recording] On the democracy issue we have clearly 
pointed out that the Peru that existed before 5 April 1992, had 
no future. There was a need to take emergency measures to 
prevent Peru from being totally undermined. I have mentioned 
previously that this was a process that subsequently took place 
in Russia; unfortunately, as we all well know, there were many 
victims. Here, one-year plus, I would say instead that we have 
rescued democracy. This is an issue that has been widely 
discussed. 
  The second issue was in regard to the strengthening the 
defense of human rights. On this we have been categorical, I 
have made myself very clear here. What human rights are we 
talking about when terrorist violence overwhelmed the whole 
community and life was not worth one cent here? True, there are 
some isolated cases [of human rights violations], but now there 
is true respect for human rights. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "From Chiapas to Huallaga"] </F>
  [Text] The theory that EXPRESO was the first in the world 
to propose that the international drug-trafficking world is 
behind the armed uprising in Chiapas, southern Mexico appears to 
have been confirmed. That is not surprising to us. 
  Of the heroin consumed in the United States, 23 percent 
comes 
from Mexico, particularly from the Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Guerrero 
States, where poppies are cultivated. The plant was also 
cultivated in Sonora, in northern Mexico, until a few months 
ago. But joint operations by Mexican Police and the DEA have 
reportedly destroyed the poppy plantations in the region. Since 
then, the cultivation of this plant has reportedly been 
concentrated in the south, where the armed struggle broke out. 
  It is possible that other elements -- ethnic, ideological, 
or 
social -- influenced the materialization of the revolt, but it 
is already a well-known fact that drug traffickers usually arm 
and finance these types of operations, because in order to 
develop their drug production schemes they must operate in 
territories that are outside the control of national 
governments. Drug trafficking prospers where there is chaos, 
where there is no law, and where the law of the strongest 
prevails. 
  It is a general rule that drug traffickers sponsor the fight 
among local armed groups and finance all parties involved in a 
struggle wherever they go. This is what happened in Huallaga. 
Here drug traffickers financed the operations of the Shining 
Path and the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement], and the 
work of corrupt Armed Forces and police agents. 
  In Huallaga, however, two events placed this game of 
confrontation out of balance: On the one hand, the military, as 
part of a national offensive against terrorism, were able to 
weaken the Shining Path and MRTA movements in the region, 
although without eliminating them. On the other hand, the 
control of airports by the Air Force and the shooting down of 
light airplanes forced many drug traffickers to look for better 
places in the central jungle and in the south of the country. 
  One of these places, for instance, was Palmapampa, in the 
Apurimac River valley, in Ayacucho. Here peasant patrols, or at 
least some of their leaders, who had heroically defeated the 
Shining Path, became the armed guards of drug traffickers. 
These peasant patrols no longer see any advantage to the total 
elimination of the Shining Path. Otherwise, how would they 
justify their operation? Besides, some officers in the Armed 
Forces fell into the hands of the zone's corruption network. 
Here we see again how drug trafficking stirs up internal 
conflicts and corrupt people to create chaos, in the midst of 
which it then reigns. 
  Over the past few years the Army has given weapons to the 
peasant patrols in coca-producing areas -- or potential 
coca-producing areas -- within the framework of the 
antisubversive struggle, creating, as a result, the potential 
for future armed uprisings in the area. Even more so now that 
peasants have begun to cultivate poppies -- the raw material for 
the production of heroin, a product that has a growing market in 
the United States -- in Cajamarca and Amazonas, areas that are 
higher and closer to their potential market. 
  Drug trafficking is very serious for many reasons. But one 
of those reasons -- perhaps the most important one -- is this: 
It sponsors the perpetuation of internal wars and corrupts the 
forces of order in order to keep a large part of the territory 
out of the reach of law and government control. It is, 
therefore, an element that goes essentially against national 
sovereignty and constitutes, without a doubt, a serious 
challenge to our national security. 
  The problem, therefore, is not simple, and the government 
does not always give it the importance it deserves. A few 
months ago we had the impression that the government would give 
priority to the fight against drug trafficking. But in the end, 
and perhaps also due to the DEA's withdrawal, the initiative did 
not materialize. The government also announced a plan to control 
the supply of precursors to producing areas -- which is 
relatively simple -- but which as far as we know was not 
implemented, either. 
  The Armed Forces internal reform program must also be 
implemented, among other things, to be able to increase 
officers' salaries to prevent corruption. 
  In general terms, we need an overall plan that will permit 
us 
to confront the problem from all angles. We also have the 
problem of money laundering, and it should be one of the topics 
in the agenda of the national call for unity announced a few 
days ago.

  [Text] Harare, 18 Jan (AFP) -- Cuban Foreign Relations 
Minister Roberto Robaina stated Tuesday in Zimbabwe during an 
AFP interview that Cuban diplomacy must be "up to date" and that 
it requires "proficiency to adapt to a world with very 
significant and different conditions." Robaina is expected to 
depart Zimbabwe on Tuesday and go to Zambia on the penultimate 
leg of an African tour that took him to Ghana and Angola and is 
expected to conclude in Namibia. 
  Robaina, who was appointed foreign relations minister in 
April 1993, indicated that Cuba will not compromise with respect 
to positions of principle, such as Cuba's independence and 
sovereignty, which, according to him, "are nonnegotiable. Our 
independence and sovereignty is not a matter for discussion, 
neither is our capability to speak for ourselves," Robaina 
stated. Cuba cannot "revert regarding those sectors that are 
sacred to us, sectors such as education and health, with which 
my people and no one in the world would forgive us if we decided 
to retrogress," he added. 
  However, he explained, Cuba "is inclined to exchange, adapt, 
and trade with anyone who is willing. In order to adapt to this 
economic world we must trade with capitalists whether we like it 
or not," he acknowledged. "I am not one of those who believes 
that all capitalists are bad," but "to trade under the pressure 
my country is undergoing is extremely difficult," he pointed 
out. 
  In reference to the U.S. blockade and the fall of the Soviet 
Union, Robaina explained that "conditions" in Cuba "are 
abnormal. My country cannot trade as it wishes and with whom it 
wishes. We would first have to disclose who are investing and 
how they are doing it. But we cannot do that. If we did," there 
would be, "pressure ... blackmail and persecution against anyone 
who decides to do business with us." 
  Nevertheless, Robaina expressed optimism with respect to 
future relations between Cuba and the United States. "I do not 
believe that the new generation of Americans is injected with 
that virus of aggression against a country that does not 
represent a threat to the United States," he pointed out. "I 
cannot believe," he stated, "that now that we are about to begin 
a new century, countries such as Cuba and the United States, 
which are merely 90 miles apart, can continue to live as we are 
currently living." I am "convinced that there must be a 
solution, but the solution must not imply that my country ceases 
to exist as a country. If it means that we have to revert to 
being the United States' back door, then we prefer that the 
solution never be found." 
  Robaina indicated that during his visit to New York last 
September he noticed that "the American people are becoming more 
aware of the senselessness of this relationship. Our message is 
being heard and more people are now aware that Cuba is not the 
hell it is depicted as being." Robaina explained that "at the 
government level there is no contact whatsoever, except with the 
Coast Guard -- border guard contacts with some joint action 
against drug trafficking. In addition, we are discussing a 
telecommunications project, but there are many differences and 
many stumbling blocks." 
  In recalling his experiences in Angola from 1988 to 1989 
when 
he was a member of an "internationalist" contingent, the Cuban 
foreign minister stated that "there has been no greater 
experience in my personal life." It "was the most important 
stage of my life," he reiterated. "In Angola we were able to 
modestly contribute to Namibia being what it is today, to its 
independence." He added that "the pages my country wrote in 
Angola were written most of all for Angola, not for Cuba." 
  Robaina, who at 37 is the youngest member of the Cuban 
Government, expressed his "amazement" at the interest caused by 
his appointment. "I am simply a visible face, maybe one of the 
most visible," he insisted. The Cuban minister added, "I don't 
see why the appointment of a minister my age should be a 
surprise when there are 5 million Cubans who are younger than 
30." 
  Our "fundamental priority lies in the surroundings we 
inhabit," he pointed out before proceeding to explain that 
Cuba's priority is in the "Caribbean and Latin American" region, 
but that Cuba must maintain "special relations" with Africa. 
  "My country is what it is because of Africa. Cuba is a mix 
of Spanish and African," he explained and added that Cuba, "has 
much to contribute in some fields, such as education, health, 
medicine, and human resources." 
  In addition, the minister declared that he is "passionately 
mad about human rights, because of the human aspect of my job," 
but believes that Cuba is being unjustly accused when "we are 
one of the countries where more human beings know that they have 
rights. Ten million Cubans know they have rights because they 
know they are humans," he indicated. "The reality for millions 
of human beings who inhabit this earth is much more tragic 
because they are not recognized as human beings and they neither 
know how to read or write. Who speaks about child prostitution 
and who is organizing it? Who speaks about the sale of 
children's organs? Who speaks about xenophobia," the minister 
asked before concluding.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina </F>
by Jose Mejia in Lusaka, Zambia -- live] 
  [Text] It is right now exactly 0213 hours in Lusaka, 
Zambia, and I am on line with the Intercontinental Hotel, where 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina is staying. Comrade 
Foreign Minister, I know you have had an intense work agenda to 
cover in 24 hours since you arrived in Zambia from Zimbabwe. We 
would like to know about the different activities carried out by 
you and the delegation accompanying you on this visit through 
five African countries, and also about the meeting you had today 
with Zambian President Frederick Chiluba and other prominent 
figures. A good evening to you from Havana, Cuba. 
  [Robaina] Well, yes, Mejia. Indeed, the past 24 hours have 
been extremely intense, and we will be leaving for Namibia in a 
few hours. In any case, I can assure you that these have been 
hours well used, to the extent that relations between the two 
countries are strong and historic. However, we have not spent 
our time talking and discussing, just to talk about how historic 
they have been, but rather to make them even more historic, and 
to make history, to the extent that we may be capable of 
strengthening [these relations]. 
  We have had extensive discussions with the Foreign Ministry, 
essentially in the spheres of education and health. These areas, 
in which cooperation already exists, will continue to be 
explored. There is a willingness on the part of the Zambian 
Government to continue and indeed increase the compensated 
cooperation in these spheres. A number of new variants have also 
appeared in the spheres of sports and agriculture, in which the 
Zambian Government believes Cuba has achieved a good deal of 
results that would also be useful to them. They have therefore 
asked that these be established as important mechanisms.... 
  [Mejia, interrupting] Yes. 
  [Robaina, continuing] for cooperation and exchange. From the 
moment we arrived, the first hours we were here, they have 
expressed their country's absolute gratitude, particularly for 
the way in which Cuba, despite its limitations and difficulties, 
has been able to contribute to training its physicians, 
engineers, and teachers. They are truly grateful for that, and 
vastly appreciative of everything Cuba has done for Africa. I 
never tire of replying to statements of this sort that although 
it is important for gratitude to exist, we also owe our 
Cuban-ness of today, and today's Cuba, to among other things, 
our African roots. And I think that the special thing today.... 
  [Mejia] Yes. 
  [Robaina, continuing] has been meeting with President 
Frederick Chiluba, who furthermore sends a special greeting to 
our people, and has recognized in a very profound and very 
serious manner the heroism of the Cuban people and the 
characteristics of its principal leaders, especially Comrade 
Fidel. He said he wished this continent had a lot of men like 
Fidel because it certainly needs them, really needs them. But, 
above all, he emphasized the way the people draw enough strength 
from where there appears to be no strength, enough to resist. He 
sent special greetings.... 
  [Mejia] Yes. 
  [Robaina, continuing] and made public his decision to visit 
Cuba on whatever date is most suitable for both the Cuban and 
Zambian sides. 
  I think these hours have been put to very good use, and, I 
repeat, one comes out of it greatly satisfied.... 
  [Mejia] Um-hmm. 
  [Robaina, continuing] to again be able to greet this land, 
this country, these men and women who maintain a special 
relationship with Cuba. 
  [Mejia] Comrade Foreign Minister, we know that the current 
government of Zambia tries to keep an active profile in foreign 
policy, basically with its neighbors in the region, as is the 
case with Malawi and, more recently, its mediation in contacts 
between representatives of Luanda and UNITA. What news do you 
have about the evolution of negotiations between the Angolan 
Government and UNITA? 
  [Robaina] Well, this is a topic with which we are familiar 
and with which we continue to keep abreast. Many of us people 
continue to be, in one way or another, linked to conflicts and 
negotiations of this kind. 
  [Mejia] Yes. 
  [Robaina] The information is exactly the same as that in our 
country. There are some talks going on, and both the Angolan 
side and the Zambian [words indistinct], site of the talks that 
are being held, agree. We notice confidence and optimism that 
they could evolve. 
  In any case, I would like, in this (?detour), not to lose 
hope. We know what has always happened with the negotiations 
carried out domestically by the Angolan side. Some of the 
parties that are participating in this negotiating process do 
not always do what has been agreed upon and committed to, and 
this makes the road much more difficult. 
  As you know, the only thing Cuba can really do is express a 
clear desire to see the negotiations progress, a clear desire to 
have them progress in the best way possible -- to have everyone 
do the impossible to keep Angola from returning to the positions 
of a declared war. And I say an openly declared war because 
although some may think that the war has ended, the war has not 
ended in Angola. There is a tremendously difficult, tremendously 
complex internal situation that is the result of the way this 
entire process of negotiations has been obstructed. It is 
getting much more difficult. 
  [Mejia] In conclusion, Foreign Minister Robaina, in a few 
hours you leave for Windhoek. I understand that during your 
visit to Namibia, and prior to concluding your African tour, you 
will be meeting with President Sam Nujoma and other government 
officials. 
  [Robaina] That is correct. We leave early tomorrow morning 
for Namibia. We have many meetings scheduled in Namibia. We will 
be meeting with members of the parliament, ministers, and with 
President Sam Nujoma. I think we can continue to talk on the 
telephone. We are happy to say that our tour ends in Namibia and 
then we will be going back home. 
  [Mejia] Comrade Foreign Minister Roberto Minister, I greatly 
appreciate your talking to me. I know I have robbed you of some 
minutes of sleep. It is now 0220 in Lusaka, Zambia. 
  Listeners, as you have heard, we have been talking to 
Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina who is on a tour of several African 
countries. 
  Thank you, Mr. Foreign Minister, for your statements to 
Radio 
Rebelde in Havana, Cuba.

  [Text] Today, his second day in Namibia, Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina will meet with Namibian Prime Minister 
Hage Geingob, National Assembly Speaker Mose Tjitendero, and 
Health and Social Services Minister Nicky Iyambo. Robaina will 
also meet with Cuban officials and doctors working in Namibia. 
There are 64 Cuban health collaborators in Namibia, most of 
whom are in Windhoek and surrounding areas. On 21 January, 
Robaina will meet with President Sam Nujoma and Trade and 
Industry Minister Hidipo Hamutenya. On 19 January, Foreign 
Minister Robaina signed an agreement eliminating all visa 
requirements for the citizens of the two countries. 
  On arrival in Windhoek, reporters asked Robaina about the 
objectives of his tour of Africa. He told them that it is part 
of a diplomatic offensive launched by Cuba. The foreign 
minister added that the so-called Dark Continent is a priority 
in this offensive because of the cultural and historic ties that 
link Cuba to the area.

  [Text] On the last day of his work visit to Cienfuegos 
Province, Army General Raul Castro Ruz, minister of the FAR 
[Revolutionary Armed Forces], visited (El Jobero), the first 
community of materials-efficient housing finished in that 
province by Military Construction Enterprise No. 3 from Villa 
Clara. The residents of the community are officers and civilian 
workers who, by residing there along with their relatives, 
contribute to raising the combat readiness of their unit. 
  Castro, who is also second secretary of the Central 
Committee 
of the Communist Party of Cuba, asked about the living 
conditions of the residents of (El Jobero), who have, among 
other facilities, a Family Doctor Program physician and other 
services nearby. 
  Also, in Cumanayagua, the FAR minister visited the Barajagua 
People's Council, one of Cienfuegos' most outstanding; and, at 
the special troops regiment, heard a report from Colonel Jose 
Antonio Marrero on the unit's preparation and combat readiness. 
  Upon taking his leave, Raul reiterated that we can be proud 
of our four armies -- the Central, the Western, the Eastern, and 
the Youth Labor Army; of our Revolutionary Armed Forces; of our 
heroic people; and of our commander in chief, Fidel Castro.

<F P=106> [Interview with Orlando Lugo Fonte, president of the </F>
National Association of Small Farmers, by Felix Fernando Garrido 
at Radio Rebelde studios in Havana -- live] 
  [Text] [Garrido] Good evening, Orlando Lugo Fonte, 
president of the National Association of Small Farmers [ANAP] 
and member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
Cuba. 
  [Lugo] Good evening. 
  [Garrido] As we have heard, 1994 will be a year of 
challenges 
for the farmers and for our country in general. What are the 
main goals of ANAP for 1994? 
  [Lugo] With the Agriculture Ministry and the Sugar Industry 
Ministry, ANAP plans to contribute to the sugarcane harvest. The 
farmers and cooperatives will do what they must do. We will also 
contribute to the food plan by exploiting, to a maximum, the 
production capacity of the cooperative and farming sectors. 
  [Garrido] In other words, in 1994 the ANAP will not abandon 
its production potential. 
  [Lugo] No. We cannot do that because we know the people need 
the products we grow and produce. As the weather improves, and 
once we can get more money, we will continue to increase 
production. 
  We are also working along other well established guidelines 
aimed at consolidating the cooperative movement. Today, more 
than ever, we must consolidate our cooperatives. We must do 
this, especially now that the country has created the Basic 
Cooperative Production Units [UBPC]. We currently have 1,118 
cooperatives; of these 1,008 are profitable. We have 
approximately 172 cooperatives that are not reporting profits, 
and we are going to work with these cooperatives to consolidate 
the cooperative movement and ensure that it truly becomes an 
example of efficiency and production. This is one of our main 
guidelines. 
  We are also working on consolidating the credit and services 
cooperatives. We want these cooperatives to grow strong. We want 
these cooperatives to have some money. The sugarcane workers are 
now being allowed to purchase their own tractors, forklifts, and 
carts. This enables them to do their own harvesting, their own 
cutting and lifting. We believe this is something we must work 
on because it is important. 
  [Garrido] What about idle land and the economic aspect? 
  [Lugo] In addition to the agreement that created the UBPC, 
the Central Committee is encouraging groups of comrades to join 
and form new UBPC's to work land that is idle. The agreement 
also states that the state will give land that is good for 
growing tobacco to those comrades who wish to work the land and 
grow tobacco. Hundreds of comrades in the tobacco growing 
provinces are joining the movement. They are now producing 
tobacco and products to feed themselves. 
  [Garrido] This year marks the 35th anniversary of the 
creation of the agrarian reform law. Will the ANAP be discussing 
the economic measures with its farmers? 
  [Lugo] Yes. On 23 January we will hold our first meeting 
with 
farmers and cooperative members from all over the country. We 
are going to discuss the economic measures the country should 
adopt. I have no doubt that farmers, the men and women who have 
always participated in the country's great tasks and missions, 
will discuss the measures and suggest those that should be 
adopted. On this 35th anniversary of the agrarian reform law, I 
believe it is our duty to participate in these discussions just 
as our working sector is doing.

  [Text] (DYN-NA) -- President Carlos Menem and several of 
his ministers united in an effort to dispel public uneasiness 
over the possibility of popular uprisings such as those that 
broke out recently in Santiago del Estero and Chiapas, Mexico. 
  "Poverty has diminished by truly unheard-of proportions," 
President Menem told reporters at Jorge Newberry Metropolitan 
Airport shortly before departing for Mar del Plata. "Thus the 
possibility of any kind of social unrest can be dismissed." 
  Turning to what critics have pegged as one cause of the 
riots 
in Santiago del Estero last month, when unpaid workers torched 
the provincial Government House, Menem denied that his 
administration's economic policies and cost cutting would lead 
to further rebellions. 
  There is no austerity programme here," said Menem, "what 
there is is a process of change and transformation that has made 
possible this stability and this growth." 
  The head of state also defended his convening of a 
sub-Cabinet one week ago Wednesday to address the need to 
monitor and prevent potential revolts. 
  The public is asking for security," he said. "You yourselves 
are constantly saying through the media that it is necessary to 
implement measures that insure security, the defence of life, 
property and the freedom of the individual." 
  Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf seconded Menem's attempt to 
end speculation over new measures the government may take to 
avert potential violence. 
  The government is not "proposing a witch hunt, nor do we 
want 
to instill any policy of fear in the public," Ruckauf told Radio 
del Plata. 
  Instead, he explained, the administration is seeking to 
boost 
co- ordination among federal and provincial police and the 
Border Guards. 
  Ruckauf defended the government's plan to provide new 
equipment to police officers and criticized those who call for 
better protection but complain about the cost. 
  The minister sought to downplay the likelihood that an 
occurrence similar to the New Year's Day uprising by the 
Zapatista National Liberation Army in Chiapas, Mexico could 
happen in Argentina. 
  "In no way do we compare Chiapas with the episode in 
Santiago," said Ruckauf. "We never said in any words that 
pockets of guerrilla activity exist here." 
  Regarding the situation in Santiago Ruckauf pointed out that 
local officials have been charged with corruption and the 
national government "is hoping too to find those responsible for 
the collective damage perpetrated upon residents" there. 
  In addition, the Joint Chiefs-of-Staff denied that Army head 
Lieutenant General Martin Balza had requested a study of the 
legal framework under which the military may participate in 
subduing domestic disputes. 
  "The Army does not condition its intervention but rather it 
is limited to the strict orders and directions that proceed from 
the constitutional authority to which it is subordinate," said 
Joint Chiefs-of-Staff spokesman Colonel Eduardo Alfonso in a 
press release. 
  Earlier yesterday Foreign Minister Guido di Tella said told 
the daily EL CRONISTA that a Chiapas-style revolt was improbable 
in Argentina because this country lacks a network of guerrillas 
or drug traffickers. 
  While Di Tella conceded that "it would be foolish to say we 
are certain that no senderista defeated in Peru is hiding in 
Argentina" he added that the government does not foresee any 
threat to stability. 
  The foreign minister further rejected the possibility that 
the government's economic policies could prompt rebellion, 
claiming that in fact "poverty has diminished in Argentina 
thanks to the cutbacks."

  [Text] Through the Parliament at the Work Centers 
discussions of the country's economic problems, we are showing 
the world how much trust the Cuban workers and people have in 
their leaders, said Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government, at a meeting with Pinar del 
Rio union leaders on the process that is going to begin at the 
base level on 28 January under the auspices of the CTC [Cuban 
Workers Federation]. 
  Alarcon pointed out that the goal of the Cuban Parliament at 
the Work Centers is not to spread the same idea throughout the 
country, but rather to expand it and really put it into 
practice, effectively managing to streamline the nation's 
internal finances. 
  (Jose Marrero Camacho), president of the Pinar del Rio 
Assembly of the People's Government, explained to the union 
leaders that in the province, for the purpose of eliminating 
economic problems, it is more effective to raise production 
efficiency than to raise the price of products. Theft that 
increases costs; a lack of monitoring of the workforce; and 
leaving one's job during the day to stand in line or to take 
care of personal problems were examples presented in Pinar del 
Rio as affecting the nation's internal economy. 
  During this meeting with provincial union leaders, with a 
view to the parliamentary assemblies at the work centers, it was 
suggested that every work group administer its own budget, and 
that the work group especially demand trustworthy accounting. 
Deputy (Maria Celia Santana) suggested that no personnel rosters 
handed down from above be accepted. Others suggested eliminating 
inappropriate egalitarianism [el igualitarismo] and paternalism. 
  A tax on salaries was amply discussed. CTC Secretary General 
Pedro Ross Leal said profitability and efficiency should be at 
the center of these discussions, with a view to solving problems.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Honduran President-elect Carlos </F>
Roberto Reina in Washington, DC, by Jacobo Goldstein in 
Tegucigalpa on 19 January; from the "Morning Paper" newscast -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Goldstein] Dr. Reina, let us 
talk about your trip to Washington. You arrived in Washington 
on the afternoon of 18 January and immediately after that you 
visited the State Department and Capitol Hill. Can you tell us 
about that, please? 
  [Reina] The meetings held yesterday were conducted in an 
atmosphere of true cooperation between the United States and the 
next Honduran Government. It was freezing cold when we reached 
Andrews Air Force Base, and we were afraid we would have some 
problems with the frozen runway. We met with Mrs. (Joan Spill), 
who is the economic charge d'affairs in the State Department. 
Afterwards we met with Senator Patrick Leahy, who was decorated 
recently in Honduras and who has always had an excellent 
attitude toward our country. At night, we attended a working 
dinner, where I was very pleased to meet again with such good 
friends as Francisco Aguirre, who is truly an institution in 
Washington. 
  [Goldstein] Dr. Reina, we understand that this morning, your 
agenda begins with a visit to the offices of the U.S. trade 
representative, where you will meet the deputy official of that 
organization and the official in charge of the Latin American 
area? 
  [Reina] We will begin our agenda with a visit to (Charlene 
Marshkenvitsky) at 0900. We will discuss Central American 
economic prospects for the next quarter with (Mrs. 
Marshkenvitsky) and [name indistinct], who is the assistant 
secretary for Latin American affairs. 
  [Goldstein] President Clinton has issued a very strong 
statement saying that he will seek a way to prevent Central 
America and the Caribbean islands being affected negatively by 
the signing of NAFTA with Mexico and Canada? 
  [Reina] I believe that that topic will be discussed soon, 
and 
the results will be the ones we expect: a rapid development of 
the area. We will continue with a visit to the BID 
[Inter-American Development Bank], and then we will have lunch 
with BID President Enrique Iglesias, who was minister in Uruguay 
during Julio Sanguinetti's administration and has deeply rooted 
democratic principles. That is our plan for this morning. 
  This afternoon, we will meet with Senator Edward Kennedy and 
Congressman Steny Hoyer, who are also strong supporters of 
democratic governments in Central and South America. 
  [Goldstein] Dr. Reina, I would like to ask about the meeting 
with Senator Kennedy and Congressman Hoyer, who is as 
influential in the House of Representatives as Kennedy is in the 
Senate. What do you expect to achieve in this meeting? 
  [Reina] I hope to get to know them directly, exchange and 
compare views with them. We have always been linked with people 
who have the highest democratic principles in Washington, and we 
hope to revitalize those relations. I had the honor of meeting 
John Kennedy, and I corresponded with Robert Kennedy. Now I 
will meet with Senator Edward Kennedy, which gives me great 
satisfaction and will be very beneficial for the rapprochement 
between Honduras and the United States. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Freddy Perdomo] </F>
  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- The elected deputies of the Liberal 
Party of Honduras [PLH] decided last night, by 40 votes in favor 
and 31 against, that the next president of Congress will be 
Carlos Roberto Flores Facusse. This ends a several-week-old 
confrontation happily: with party unity. 
  Under the auspices of the Central Executive Council [CCE], 
by 
delegation of President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina, the 71 
deputies met yesterday in the Legislative Palace to decide if 
Flores Facusse or Jorge Arturo Reina would be the president of 
the next National Congress. The CCE president asked each deputy 
who would he vote for. 
  At the end of the vote, Flores Facusse obtained 40 votes and 
Jorge Arturo received 31. In the end, Reina -- brother of the 
president-elect -- accepted the vote, praised the election 
procedure, and warned he would not hamper Flores Facusse's 
victory, thereby securing PLH unity. 
  Beginning early that morning elected deputies lobbied, but 
they did not know what mechanism would be used for the election. 
  The Centenario Hotel -- which, according to a CCE provision, 
would be the place where the 71 deputies would meet -- became a 
gathering place only for the supporters of Jorge Arturo Reina. 
  At approximately 1100, 27 elected deputies had arrived at 
the 
Centenario and ratified their support for the president-elect's 
brother. 
  During the morning at the Alameda Hotel, few supporters of 
Flores Facusse entered the hotel and everything seemed to 
indicate that some of them had changed their mind and would 
support Reina. 
  By midday, CCE members met at the residence of Enrique Ortez 
Colindrez in Los Castanos Sur to define the voting mechanism. 
They concluded the voting would take place in two stages: 
First, the deputies would vote secretly on whether the final 
vote was to be secret or not. They finally chose the latter 
alternative. 
  When they learned of the CCE resolution, the deputies who 
supported Flores Facusse met at the residence of Nick Atala in 
El Hatillo to travel together to the National Congress. 
  At approximately 1400 Jorge Arturo Reina was still 
optimistic 
and said he counted on votes of over 40 deputies, the same 
number Flores Facusse had said supported him several weeks ago. 
  From that moment on, activists from both sides began to 
arrive at the Legislative Palace shouting and at times there 
were altercations. The first to arrive were the deputies who 
supported the brother of the president-elect, followed by Flores 
Facusse and finally Reina, who was received with an ovation. At 
some point in time, it was considered Reina would pull out from 
the vote because he thought he was losing. 
  At about 1800, the room's curtain opened and many members of 
the public entered; then several deputies yelled: "Flores won." 
A few minutes later, Flores Facusse left and the happiness seen 
in his face confirmed his victory. His first words were to 
praise "the dignity" of the parliamentarians who had supported 
him, but he also recognized Reina's supporters. 
  Minutes later Reina appeared with an expression that clearly 
reflected the face of defeat. However, his first words were 
also a call for unity and respect for the majority's decision. 
  After giving statements separately and later together, the 
two candidates embraced as a show of unity that appeared 
sincere, not only as fellow party members but also as 
parents-in-law [consuegros].

  [Text] Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus told the 
"24 Hours" newscast that his election as OAS secretary general 
is guaranteed. He added that he is confident that Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria will not run for the post. 
  The Costa Rican foreign minister said he has been virtually 
elected OAS secretary general because he has the confirmed 
support of 23 countries: He needs 18 votes to be elected. 
  [Begin Niehaus recording] If elections are held without 
pressure -- in Costa Rica we call it arm twisting -- we will 
obviously win. [end recording] 
  Referring to the possible confirmation of Colombian 
President 
Cesar Gaviria's candidacy to the post, he clearly suggested that 
Gaviria give up the possibility of officially announcing his 
candidacy. 
  [Begin Niehaus recording] Twenty-two or 23 countries are 
convinced this is fair. I am sure other countries will join 
them. Above all, I am sure -- and I say it with great respect -- 
that President Gaviria will take these aspects into 
consideration and abstain from officially announcing his 
candidacy. [end recording]

Guatemalan capital city and a large part of the country without 
electricity, official sources reported today. 
  Electric company authorities who were contacted by AFP 
claimed not to know the cause of the outage, which occurred at 
0815 [1415 GMT], or when service will be restored. 
  Guatemala has experienced an escalation of attacks over the 
past 48 hours, with bomb explosions in the Congress and in four 
telecommunications towers in the western region of the country, 
which local media have attributed to leftist guerrillas.

  [Text] At 0818, the entire country was plunged into a 
blackout. Electrical service was restored at 0930. The blackout 
was caused by a malfunction in auxilliary service equipment at 
the Chixoy hydroelectric plant in Pueblo Viejo, Pixao. This 
malfunction shut down Guatemala City's five power plants, which 
were functioning normally. 
  At a news conference, Jorge Cabreras, president of the 
National Institute of Electrification, said that when the 
malfunction occurred, the Chixoy plant was generating 50 percent 
of the nation's power supply. 
  [Begin Cabreras recording] This is the most important plant 
in the system, and at that time it was generating 50 percent of 
the power the country was consuming. The plant was generating 
50 or 60 megawatts when it broke down, and the malfunction shut 
down all of the other plants. The other plants [words 
indistinct] when an effort was made to put the sytem back on 
line, and then it became necessary to [word indistinct] and we 
received assistance from the [word indistinct] system, which is 
connected to El Salvador's. 
  The problem was resolved approximately one hour and ten 
minutes after it started. According to the information we have 
from our technicians, there was no sabotage. Technical problems 
produced the blackout. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Speech by Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon Carpio in </F>
Guatemala City -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] People of Guatemala, in response to recent events, 
which are an attempt to create anxiety and instability in the 
country, and as president of the Republic and the person 
responsible for preserving public order, I must inform you of 
the following: 
  1. I will not permit, for any reason or motive, small groups 
interested in creating an atmosphere of intimidation through the 
escalation of actions that violate the law and the de jure state 
to interrupt the effort initiated by the government and people 
to set this country on the path which will make it a truly 
democratic state. 
  2. It is evident that the government's and people's efforts 
are achieving consolidation, and the reaction of these small 
groups is to use terrorism, intimidation, and attacks, among 
other methods, against state institutions and organizations, and 
what is even worse, against the news media, thereby violating 
the sacred right to freedom of expression and the human, 
individual, and collective right to inform and be informed. 
These extremist, radical groups, composed of sick and 
reactionary minds, know they have no valid arguments whatsoever 
to interrupt a process which, moreover, is irreversible and will 
lead us to the achievement of a different Guatemala. 
  3. The Guatemalan people have left behind the obscure pages 
of their history. We no longer want to pay with human lives as 
we regrettably did just a few hours ago. It is necessary for us 
to keep in mind that only a few days ago the government of the 
Republic and the General Command of the Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity, with the United States as witness, signed 
an agreement to resume the peace negotiations, thereby 
demonstrating our political resolve and pledge to achieve peace 
in 1994. 
  4. The eminently positive reaction there has been to the 
upcoming popular consultation will strengthen state 
organizations. This is not advantageous for certain groups whose 
position is not precisely institutional, and which have 
misinformed and confused the population. They have even taken 
advantage of these terrorist acts to create a negative image of 
the government and, obviously, to attempt to create 
confrontations between state organizations. 
  5. I will not accept or tolerate such games because the 
Executive Branch, representing the Guatemalan people, is trying 
to purge Congress and the Supreme Court of Justice. As a 
president who is aware of his duties, I have chosen the most 
difficult path: the legal and peaceful path. This is why I want 
to achieve this goal through a popular consultation instead of 
creating a situation which the terrorists are trying to make the 
people believe exists. 
  6. It is the belief of my government, which has inspired the 
popular consultation, that it is necessary to build a society 
which will accept the existence of a variety of ideas and the 
discussion of opposing points of view or, basically, a society 
which, within a climate of respect and confidence in the law and 
institutions, will accept these elements as a necessity in the 
de jure state we are building. 
  7. It is for this reason that we are determined to preserve 
the continuity of this process by adopting the legal and 
constitutional measures that circumstances may render necessary, 
and to achieve peace and guarantee public order based on the 
principle that it is the state's duty to preserve itself. 
Therefore, the Executive Branch will protect and maintain 
institutional order, and incidents like these will not alter the 
people's participation in the public consultation, let alone its 
results. Thank you very much.

  [Text] In condemning the wave of terrorist attacks 
occurring just as the referendum is about to be held, Attorney 
General Jorge Mario Garcia Laguardia said yesterday that the use 
of explosives is not the solution to Guatemala's political 
crisis. 
  Garcia Laguardia called on the masterminds of the terrorist 
attacks to refrain from such practices and to seek other means 
of solving problems. He also indicated that actions such as 
these endanger the lives of innocent people who are not 
responsible for the problems. 
  The attorney general was referring specifically to the 
explosion in front of Channel 7 this past Tuesday, the one 
between 18th Street and 6th Avenue the day before yesterday, and 
the one in front of the National Congress building early 
yesterday morning. Garcia also stated that other explosive 
devices had been deactivated throughout the city. 
  Garcia Laguardia said that those who intend to destabilize 
the democratic system through terrorism and anarchy should 
reconsider because their attitude is not good for Guatemalans; 
on the contrary, it only endangers the lives of others.

  [Text] Several deputies have blamed President Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio for the terrorist attack that took place early 
yesterday morning against the Congress building. 
  Vinicio Villar Anleu, legislature president, has estimated 
the damage at 100,000 quetzales, adding this will entail 
expenses at a time when it is necessary to make efforts to get 
the country ahead. 
  Deputy Clodoveo Dominguez has said the person directly 
responsible for this situation is President de Leon Carpio, who 
has made statements that apparently seek a confrontation with 
the sole purpose of progressing with his referendum. 
  Independent Deputies Jose Carlos Acevedo and Miguel Angel 
Montepeque have also blamed President de Leon Carpio for this 
act of violence, because he warned in his recent statements he 
was willing to take measures, which he did not specify, should 
the referendum fail. 
  The center's Arturo Amiel has said the president is 
responsible, because he is delivering statements that incite 
destabilization and he is showing he is incapable of maintaining 
security in the country. 
  Christian Democrat Enrique Guillen Funes has described 
President de Leon Carpio as a spoiled child who is making 
statements without thinking what the repercussions these may 
have, and--what is worse-- he is setting aside his role as the 
statesman he claims to be. 
  Congressman Francisco Reyes Lopez, from the Guatemalan 
Republican Front, has expressed regret that at this time, when 
we are trying to have a referendum, someone is trying to mar the 
situation with threats that, as in this case, are used by any 
group or sector to create unrest. 
  Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla Vega has said the bomb attack is a 
way of stopping and frightening Congress, and therefore the 
president should determine the origin of the attack. 
  Representative Eduardo Matute feels this action seeks to 
incite the population to rise up against Congress, and therefore 
it is an outrage against Congress. 
  Several deputies have agreed the government's lack of 
capability to guarantee the security of Guatemalans became 
evident once again with the terrorist attack executed early 
yesterday morning against the Legislative Palace. 
  The center's Mario Mazariegos has said that unfortunately 
now-- when it is very close to the referendum--various sectors 
are interested in creating problems, and they are taking 
advantage of the situation, while the government is incapable of 
implementing a security operation to guarantee Guatemalans' 
lives and calmness. 
  Mazariegos has warned the conditions prevailing in the 
country apparently seek to lead Guatemalans to chaos, with the 
only purpose of marring Congress' prestige. 
  Independent representative Eduardo Matute has said the 
attack 
carried out against a group of people in an area of 18th Street, 
central zone, reflects that the security forces are incapable of 
guaranteeing citizens' peace and security. 
  Meanwhile, Juan Francisco Alfaro Mijangos, Congress third 
vice president, has said: "We must admit that the lack of 
experience of those who are in the government is leading the 
country to chaos due to the lack of coordinated programs such as 
in the case of public security." He concluded: "Consequently, 
we realize we are at the mercy of any group of power or any 
sector interested in creating chaos, a situation that seems to 
worsen as we get closer to the referendum." 
  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio is leading the country to 
chaos, political leader Rodolfo Rosales Garcia Salas said today 
when commenting on what he described as an "unprecedented 
institutional crisis." 
  He added that trying to solve that problem with a referendum 
is what unfortunately justifies the terrorist wave, which has 
caused so far only damage to shops and public buildings. 
  He added that even though the terrorist actions are rejected 
by all--as they endanger the lives of innocent people--President 
de Leon Carpio is responsible for the situation of instability, 
because he does not have the qualities of a statesman for ruling. 
  Rosales Garcia-Salas has assured that the constitutional 
reforms proposed by the president do not satisfy the people's 
needs, as these reforms are the product of settlements with 
deputies who have betrayed the confidence the people gave them, 
he concluded.

<F P=106> [Report by the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso announced 
this Wednesday that the security measures to be adopted on 30 
January for the referendum do not include the presence of 
security personnel inside voting centers. 
  The minister also condemned Tuesday night's attack in 
Guatemala City, which included the use of so-called leaflet 
bombs [bombas panfleteras]. Ortiz Moscoso said there are ways 
to express opposition to the referendum without resorting to 
violence. 
  The government minister explained that he was unable to give 
further details on the overall security measures to be used on 
30 January during the referendum. 
  [Begin recording] [Ortiz] Basically, we expect to carry out 
very thorough, respectful, nonaggressive, but sufficiently 
energetic security measures around the voting centers. The 
objective is to see that people can cast their votes in total 
confidence. Security inside the voting centers will be the 
responsibility of officials appointed by the electoral tribunal. 
There will be no armed military, national police, or finance 
police personnel inside the voting centers. These measures have 
worked before and have been acknowledged internationally. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Ortiz] Yes, that is not our responsibility. To settle that 
matter it is necessary to resort to the electoral law. A 
summons was duly issued by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which 
adopted it as a rule for those days. In other words, security 
will be guaranteed 24 hours prior to the referendum and 
throughout the day on which the voting is scheduled to take 
place. As far as we are concerned [words indistinct]. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct]? 
  [Ortiz] No, it is very difficult identify anyone in 
particular. However, it is easy to infer that we are talking 
about people or organizations intent on blocking the internal 
pacification process. They are determined to prevent the 
Guatemalan people from experimenting with a mechanism like the 
referendum, which has never been used in Guatemala. The 
authorities and the Government Ministry in particular believe 
that the methods these groups are willing to use are not only 
reprehensible but unjustified. As I told the media a fews days, 
there is no sense in resorting to bombs, even it is was merely a 
pamphlet bomb, to try to convince the population to vote for, 
against, or not at all in the referendum. The media are 
available to any group wishing to express their opposition in a 
democratic manner. It really makes no sense. We could 
understand it somewhat if there were restrictions on freedom of 
expression. [Words indistinct] not only because freedom of 
expression is guaranteed, but also because the media has their 
own initiatives, which no one seeks to limit. The media can 
interview anyone they wish. For these groups to resort to 
methods such as these merely to frighten the people is 
depressing and reprehensible. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Castanaza Rosales] </F>
  [Text] National Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez 
reported yesterday that he will visit the United States from 24 
to 28 January following a Pentagon invitation to visit its 
installations and other military sites in Washington. 
  Enriquez added: "I will take the opportunity to exchange 
views with some of the U.S. generals. The opportunity is great 
not only to learn about general culture but to learn about the 
views of the military authorities of that country with regard to 
Guatemala." 
  Concerning the possibility of discussing the Civilian 
Self-Defense Patrols (PAC) after the letter sent by the 
president to his counterpart Bill Clinton, he said: "if they 
ask me about the PAC's, I will reiterate what De Leon Carpio 
stated, that they will disappear when the internal armed 
confrontation ends." 
  In addition, he noted that the PAC's have significantly 
drawn 
down in Guatemala as a result of a drop in the subversive 
effort. Consequently, these patrols have gone from 1 million 
members in 1983 to 433,000 in 1993. He also said that there 
were only 17,000 weapons among them. In many departments, the 
PAC's were turned into committees for development without the 
control of the armed institution. 
  He further remarked that the Defense Ministry budget has 
always been less than those of the Education and Health 
Ministries. At present, it is only 8.2 percent of the national 
budget. 
  On another topic, the minister said that, if necessary, in a 
meeting to be held with certain labor leaders he will tell them 
that he favors the yes vote in the referendum because it is a 
legal mechanism and because the Army is the guarantor of the 
constitutional order. He said he has read the constitutional 
reforms and that he believes they are aimed at improving public 
administration in the country because in the case of the 
confidential points [confidenciales] and other important 
matters, there is nothing that hurts society. "They are 
measures that if implemented, we will have the Guatemala we want 
in the near future, perhaps, slowly, but surely and within the 
framework of the Constitution," he noted. 
  He stated that if he were a civilian and had the option to 
vote, he would vote yes because it is a benefit. He said that 
he supports the reforms because "it is not a matter of backing a 
political party, it is not party politics. It is truly 
something done for Guatemala." 
  During the news conference, Enrique officially presented 
Colonel Morris Eugenio de Leon Gil, the new chief of Information 
and Press Department of the Army (DIDE). De Leon Gil promised 
to be open to the media 24 hours a day.

  [Text] During a news conference held yesterday, President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio warned that if the no vote wins in the 
popular consultation on constitutional reforms, he will adopt 
drastic measures within the law. 
  He said a statesman must foresee criticism regarding 
electoral activity, and he, in effect, has planned several 
strategies that he will not disclose due to obvious reasons. He 
ruled out resorting to undemocratic activities such as 
dissolving Congress. 
  De Leon Carpio's remarks were made merely 10 days before 
approximately 3.5 million Guatemalans of voting age will 
participate in the first referendum of its kind in the country's 
political history. 
  After noting that he has prepared some "strategies" if the 
popular consultation fails, the reporters repeatedly asked him 
what will be the nature of these strategies, and the president 
said only: "You will learn about them in due time." 
  De Leon Carpio also ruled out that the Supreme Electoral 
Tribunal will prohibit departmental tours, because his duty is 
to deliver the 8-percent constitutional fund to the 
municipalities and not to campaign for the yes vote, much less 
use state resources as speculated by certain people, he 
explained. 
  "I trust that the results will be favorable, because the 
people do not want vices to continue at Congress and the Supreme 
Court. In fact, ever since I assumed office, they have been 
demanding a purge in the three [as published] organizations," he 
said. 
  He said he respects the position of various popular sectors, 
including the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG), an 
organization that is urging a no vote. De Leon Carpio says the 
consultation will be a civic celebration in which all sectors 
will participate. 
  De Leon Carpio rejected pressures from public employees who, 
he said, are asking for a salary increase in exchange for not 
interfering in the popular consultation. Regarding the energy 
policy, he said electricity rates have not yet been established. 
  In conclusion, the president agreed with Vice President 
Arturo Herbruger Asturias who said "to vote no is to be totally 
insane."

  [Text] Yesterday, Government Minister Arnoldo Oriz Moscoso 
said he plans to counter drug trafficking in Central America in 
1994 by reinforcing international agreements. 
  He gave the information outside the National Palace after 
being asked what he knew about the arrest of Guatemalan citizen 
Velmar Espina Novo, who was involved in a cocaine shipment in 
Nicaragua. Ortiz said: "For the time being we have no official 
information only that a person was arrested. We will therefore 
solicit information on the alleged Guatemalan drug trafficker 
and the alleged member of the military, Byron Robeto Morales." 
  He said there are signed agreements on antidrug trafficking, 
which will be put into effect with the United States, Colombia, 
Mexico, and the remaining isthmian countries. Ortiz admitted 
Guatemala is becoming more and more a bridge for drugs and a 
storage center as well. 
  Regarding the death of inmates in penitentiaries, he said 
each case is being investigated, although most deaths seem to be 
prompted by fights or personal vengeance.

Anniversary. 
  Exactly 22 years ago, our heroic and combative revolutionary 
POOR PEOPLE'S GUERRILLA ARMY-EGP-emerged. Today it is an active 
URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] member. TO 
STRUGGLE AGAINST SOCIAL INJUSTICES. 
  On this 19 January we are 22 years old, taking the 
revolutionary message to the poor people, Indians, and 
Spanish-speaking Indians [ladinos], to our brothers seeking 
peace with social justice, respect for human rights, and 
economic and political changes. We have achieved acceptance by 
the people in general. 
  The government and Army have tried to defeat us militarily 
with great offensives against our war fronts during 1987 to 1988 
and during February and May 1993, which ended with a suspension 
of the dialogue and the fall of Serrano Elias. Our fighters and 
cadres have known how to face and defeat Army offensives. 
  We firmly continue our revolutionary struggle and are 
willing 
to sign peace if the government and Army accept to make deep 
human rights, economic, and political changes in the country. 
If this is not the case, the armed struggle shall continue, 
because they have never defeated us.

  [Text] San Salvador, 20 Jan (DPA) -- Javier Roberto 
Perdomo, 50, a Panamanian technician from the Interamerican 
Institute of Agricultural Science (IICA) was murdered in El 
Salvador by individuals who machine-gunned his vehicle in the 
interior of the country, Miriam Isabel Bermudez, Panamanian 
ambassador to El Salvador, reported today. 
  According to judicial sources, the incident occurred last 
night on the Pan-American Highway, in Santa Cruz Michapa 
jurisdiction, 20 km from San Salvador, in Cuscatlan Department. 
The reports said that the vehicle Perdomo was driving was 
machine-gunned, and that his wife, Rosa de Perdomo, and their 
daughter were seriously wounded. The three of them were 
returning to the capital from eastern El Salvador. 
  Authorities said today they have no clues to determine if 
the 
attack was politically motivated or if it was carried out by 
common criminals who hold up vehicles on certain points of the 
highway at night, shooting at the drivers when they refuse to 
stop. Ambassador Bermudez said today she has no further details 
on the incident, adding that Perdomo's body will be returned to 
Panama tomorrow. 
  Perdomo had been working for the IICA -- which is an OAS 
regional organization -- in El Salvador for approximately two 
and a half years. 
  Perdomo's wife, who is recovering at a private hospital in 
San Salvador, is the key witness to help authorities clear up 
this incident, in which a Panamanian citizen was killed in El 
Salvador.

  [Text] The Salvadoran Chamber of Commerce and Industries 
has expressed support for the decision by the U.S. Congress to 
reduce economic aid by 70 percent because this will make El 
Salvador less dependent on the United States. 
  Ricardo Montenegro, president of the Chamber of Commerce and 
Industries, noted, however, that this reduction might affect 
several national reconstruction projects which depend on foreign 
aid. Montenegro believes that during the past year our country 
achieved substantial economic growth. Therefore, we are more 
likely to become independent of foreign aid. This economic 
growth will increase year after year and foreign aid, such as 
that from the United States, will become dispensable. 
  [Begin Montenegro recording] We are pleased about this. We 
had been told that the aid would be suspended gradually. It is 
becoming a reality. We have always believed and felt that as 
Salvadorans we should become self-sufficient and stop depending 
on friendly countries. [end recording] 
  This year the U.S. Government might reduce aid to the 
country 
from $230 million to $94 million, which is 70 percent. Although 
the Chamber of Commerce and Industries views this measure with 
good eyes, it is anticipated that some projects to be carried 
out in keeping with the national reconstruction plan may 
experience some delay. 
  [Begin Montenegro recording] It could be that some projects, 
especially those involving reconstruction, might be delayed if 
the aid is cut definitely or in large amounts. We are certain 
that the U.S. Government is quite aware of the country's 
situation. We don't think they will make substantial aid cuts.

<F P=106> [Report by Boris Zelada; from the "YSU Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Dr. Miguel Angel Salaverria has 
said our country has not yet received official notification of 
the reduction in U.S. aid to this country. According to him, 
since 1985 economic aid has declined and will continue to 
decline until 1996, when it will disappear completely. 
Consequently, the central government has prepared a series of 
plans aimed at solving the situation in a firm and specific 
manner. 
  [Begin recording] [Salaverria] Our plans have been made 
taking into account the projected aid reduction. The news has 
just been publicized, but we knew six to eight months ago that 
aid would be reduced. Now, when you referred to an aid package 
last year totaling over $200 million, this includes other forms 
of aid and not direct aid. 
  For instance, during the war there were years in which we 
received approximately $100 million worth of military aid. Now 
we have no military aid, as we no longer need it because the war 
is over. This may be the great difference in all this. Later, 
military aid was cut to $90 million, $70 million, $40 million, 
and so on. It was difficult to keep it at $13 million last 
year. And now we are faced with no military aid, because we do 
not have a war. 
  [Unidentified reporter] However [words indistinct] 
reconstruction of the country [words indistinct] made calls to 
help. Several governments offered assistance [words indistinct] 
offers have not materialized. Does the Foreign Ministry [words 
indistinct] to bring in this aid? 
  [Salaverria] Yes. This effort to receive aid offers is an 
everyday task not only for the Foreign Relations Ministry, but 
also for the Planning and Finance Ministries. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the official stressed that Salvadorans who have 
relatives in Los Angeles, California, must advise them to appear 
before the Federal Administration for Managing Emergencies, 
known by its English acronym, FEMA, or call this institution at 
1-800-525-0321, or call the Los Angeles Red Cross at 
213-739-4543 to receive aid. Salaverria explained U.S. 
institutions provide humanitarian aid to all persons, regardless 
of their official immigration status, which basically is not 
considered in determining humanitarian assistance to disaster 
victims.

<F P=106> [Report by Ernesto Landos; from the "YSU Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Joaquin Villalobos, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] leader, said this Thursday a 60-percent 
reduction in U.S. aid to El Salvador may adversely affect the 
peace process. During the 11 years of armed conflict, the U.S. 
Government invested some $6 billion in El Salvador, and so it is 
inconvenient to cut that aid, Villalobos said. He said the 
country still greatly depends on foreign cooperation. 
  [Begin Villalobos recording] We have signed peace accords, 
and aid will be reduced by 60 percent two years after signing. 
They invested $6 billion in 11 years and should at least invest 
30 percent to 40 percent now. I believe this aid cutback is 
inconvenient. This may adversely affect the peace process. 
  The country has been greatly affected by the war in terms of 
its economic production recovery. One cannot ask that the 
economic recovery be accomplished overnight. We still depend 
not only on our participation in international markets but also 
on foreign cooperation and remittances from Salvadoran emigres; 
therefore, reestablishing production capacity and our economic 
incorporation into international markets will take some time. 
We require a careful treatment to consolidate our process. 
[end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the former FMLN commander said he has enough 
evidence to corroborate the involvement of one of the country's 
most prominent businessmen in the death squads. He also said 
they are expecting the accuser to testify before the 
corresponding court. 
  [Begin Villalobos recording] What the defense has proposed 
now is that the accuser, Mr. (De Sol), say what he has to say. 
He has not yet appeared in court, but they want me to appear, 
and this is inconvenient. We remain strong and ready to defend 
ourselves. What happens is that the timeframe for the juridical 
process would not be the same as if deliberations were 
political. [end recording] 
  Villalobos said that until the process receives the 
importance and juridical value it deserves, he will not present 
the evidence he has against the businessman.

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Alfredo Cristiani has said the cut in U.S. 
aid will not affect adversely the nation's development, because 
the country's economy started to pick up late last year. 
  Earlier this week the country learned that the U.S. 
Government would possibly cut its economic aid to El Salvador by 
60 percent for the present year--from $230 million down to $94 
million. 
  President Alfredo Cristiani has said in this regard that the 
reduction will not affect adversely the country's development, 
because the economy has improved. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] The country has shown an 
economic 
improvement, meaning it is capable of sustaining a decrease in 
aid so that we can stand on our own. I believe it is the final 
objective, because we cannot live off of foreign donations. [end 
recording] 
  We learned on Thursday that UN Human Rights expert (Pedro 
Nicken) had certain difficulties in entering the country, but 
President Cristiani has denied his entry had been disallowed. 
Cristiani has said the UN official may draft his report when he 
wishes. 
  [Begin Cristiani recording] He may come here whenever he 
wants. He can visit the country and see for himself. I believe 
he will take a look at Onusal's [UN Observers for El Salvador] 
reports before drafting his own report. [end recording] 
  President Cristiani inaugurated on Thursday a soft-drink 
processing plant, which will operate in the area of Soyapango, 
at a cost of 75 million colons. Its high technology will lead 
to better methods of quality control.

  [Text] ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] and the 
FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] have agreed 
that the human rights report, which is to be prepared by a 
United Nations delegate whom -- it is said -- the government 
denied entry to the country, should not be based on Onusal [UN 
Observers for El Salvador] documents. 
  It has been unofficially disclosed that Pedro (?Nicken), an 
independent Onusal human rights investigator, will work on a 
report on human rights in El Salvador from another country 
because he has been denied entry to El Salvador. The report 
will be based on Onusal documents. 
  Dr. Miguel Saenz of the FMLN said the government did, in 
fact, deny the UN delegate entry to the country, but he added 
that the report the delegate intends to prepare will not be as 
accurate if it is not based on information confirmed in El 
Salvador. 
  [Begin Saenz recording] It is one thing to prepare a report 
based on other reports, and quite another to go to the scene and 
directly and objectively determine what the facts are. 
  However, when an (?expert's) entry into the country is not 
facilitated, [words indistinct] so people who must assess the 
human rights situation in El Salvador can form a clear idea of 
the country's true situation. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, ARENA Deputy Rene Figueroa agreed with Saenz that 
the report should not be based on Onusal documents. In 
Figueroa's opinion, the report will provide unreliable 
information on human rights in El Salvador if it is based on 
Onusal documents. 
  [Begin Figueroa recording] I do not think it would be to our 
advantage for this gentleman to base his report on Onusal 
documents, because Onusal's information is already somewhat 
outdated. I am not trying to detract from the good job Onusal 
has done, but the report should be based on updated information 
on human rights improvements in our country. 
  We are aware that [words indistinct] for this gentleman to 
do 
his work, and the government has never denied him entry. The 
problem is -- I repeat -- that the permit for him to work in El 
Salvador arrived one day late. [end recording] 
  Figueroa said the information the delegate uses for his 
report could be provided by other institutions such as the 
Attorney General's Office or the Salvadoran Human Rights 
Commission.

  [Text] Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate of the 
ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), announced 
yesterday the start of the electoral campaign for his party's 
candidates for deputies. 
  Calderon Sol, who was accompanied by his running mate, Dr. 
Enrique Borgo Bustamante, and the candidates for deputy in the 
country's 14 departments, emphasized the importance the next 
Legislative Assembly will have, given its support will make the 
executive work smoother for the benefit of the neediest families 
in the country. 
  According to Calderon Sol, the candidates for deputy, as 
well 
as the presidential ticket, will conduct a lofty campaign aimed 
at making Salvadorans aware of the work ARENA will conduct in 
the Executive Branch to continue upgrading the country's 
legislature. 
  This is the fourth time ARENA has participated in elections 
to choose representatives to the Legislative Assembly. It has 
controlled the assembly with a conservative majority of deputies 
during the last two assemblies. 
  "El Salvador wants to live in harmony, peace, and social 
welfare, and that is why it wants Executive and Legislative 
Branches that coordinate with each other to give continuity to 
the country's social and economic development," he said. 
  During the announcement made at ARENA headquarters, Calderon 
Sol said the 60-percent reduction of U.S. aid to the country had 
been programmed already, and so it must not cause surprise, much 
less uncertainty, he added. 
  The reduction is a recognition of the president's actions 
over the past years, Calderon Sol said, adding that El Salvador 
is no longer a country that needs to be held by the hand, given 
that it has sufficient forces to move ahead. As proof of the 
above, he said the inflation rate in 1993 decreased by 12 
percent; better control over fiscal funds were established; 
exports rose; and local and foreign investment grew considerably. 
  According to the ARENA presidential candidate, a public 
debate with his opponents, Fidel Chavez Mena and Ruben Zamora, 
would not make sense, given the public challenges they have made 
are part of a publicity strategy from which they hope to extract 
electoral gains. 
  "They are dropping considerably in the people's preference, 
and they lack popular support," he said, adding that his life 
has always been a challenge, and now he is facing the biggest 
challenge, namely serving society and meeting its needs as 
future president.

<F P=106> [Declaration released by the presidents of the Common Market </F>
of the South, Mercosur, following their fifth summit in Colonia 
del Sacramento, Uruguay, on 17 January] 
  [Text] 1. In accordance with Article 11 of the Asuncion 
Treaty, the Fifth Summit of the Mercosur Council was held on 17 
January 1994 in Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, with the 
participation of Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco, Paraguayan President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy, and Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle. 
  2. The presidents express satisfaction over the 
participation 
of Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at the meeting. 
  3. They emphasize that the results of the Mercosur 
negotiations are an exceptional experience in the region and 
represent an important asset and the basis for the permanent 
development of the integration process. 
  4. The presidents reaffirm the principles, objectives, and 
timetables established in the Asuncion Treaty to progress in a 
coordinated, balanced, and sustained manner toward the 
standardization of the customs procedures which will set the 
basis for the structure of the Common Market. 
  They reaffirm their conviction that integration can 
strengthen and consolidate the democratic process in the four 
countries if it strongly contributes to the promotion of 
economic development and social justice. 
  5. Recognizing that the prosperity of their people and the 
achievement of a high standards of living is their main 
challenge, the presidents express special satisfaction over the 
substantial increase in intra-Mercosur trade, which has risen 
from $3.6 billion in 1990 -- before the signing of the Asuncion 
Treaty -- to more than $8 billion in 1993. 
  This accelerated trade growth is the result, among other 
factors, of the fulfillment of the commercial liberation program 
which currently has a tariff preference of 82 percent between 
the states, the gradual elimination of non-tariff barriers, and 
the impulse given to commercial and productive initiatives 
jointly implemented by businessmen of the four countries. 
  6. They express satisfaction over the technical progress on 
the common external tariff. They confirm their determination to 
define the common external tariff by 30 June 1994 as a vital 
instrument for structuring customs tariffs, which is a 
significant stage in the establishment of Mercosur. 
  7. They stress that the coordination of macroeconomic 
policies is essential for the success of the integration process 
and emphasize that the fulfillment of the timetable established 
in Las Lenas [Argentina] and the implementation of the decision 
by the Mrecosur Council on the common external tariff -- which 
are measures and instruments for structuring Mercosur -- 
represents a firm commitment by the four country members. 
  They agree that the progress on the different priority areas 
must be balanced and simultaneous. 
  They reaffirm the important role of the Mercosur group to 
reach such objectives and resolve issues of priority interest 
for the four countries and recognize the need to coordinate more 
frequent meetings of the group. 
  8. The presidents highlight the importance of the special 
meeting to be held this year to establish the institutional 
structure of Mercosur which will in turn draw up the permanent 
institutions that will become operational on 1 January 1995. 
  They note the importance of granting legal status to 
Mercosur 
as of 1 January 1995 to strengthen the permanence of the 
association established between the country members. 
  9. The presidents recognize the importance of physical 
integration for the complete implementation of Mercosur and 
reiterate their support for the many works of infrastructure 
that are being projected or implemented, particularly bridges, 
roads, river interconnections, and waterways. The presidents 
express their willingness to enhance these projects. 
  10. The presidents recognize that the integration process 
does not mean progress in the economic field alone and emphasize 
the achievements of the specialized meeting of the education 
ministers, particularly the commitment to sign an agreement to 
recognize certificates, titles, and primary and secondary 
non-technical studies before 30 June. 
  They express satisfaction over the results of the 
specialized 
meetings on science, technology, and the environment. 
  11. The presidents stress the progress made in terms of 
enhancing employment, migration, workers' protection, and the 
process of harmonizing the labor legislations of member 
countries. 
  12. Within the context of Latin American integration, the 
presidents recognize the importance of strengthening the Latin 
American Integration Association and emphasize the need to 
maintain the integrity of the 1980 Montevideo Treaty which paved 
the way for a important number of achievements. 
  The presidents stress that the protocol interpreting Article 
44 of the 1980 Montevideo Treaty -- which will be formalized at 
the Eighth Ministers Council -- is an important instrument that 
guarantees the integrity and juridical security of the treaty in 
face of integration processes involving member countries and 
developed countries from outside the region. 
  To further promote the trade that Mercosur member countries 
maintain with other South American countries, they will 
negotiate with their regional partners, as of this year, new 
agreements to ensure continuity and expansion of their economic 
relations and to increase the liberalization of trade. 
  13. The presidents stress that the integration momentum of 
the past few years has facilitated the creation of new 
subregional structures that need to be contemplated in order to 
promote their gradual convergence and to achieve better trade 
relations of Mercosur members with other brotherly countries. 
  Within this context, the presidents studied the Brazilian 
Government proposal that was submitted at the Rio Group meeting 
in Santiago de Chile to form a South American free trade area. 
The presidents proposed convening a conference during 1994 to 
define the mechanisms and instruments needed to conform such an 
area. 
  14. The presidents reiterate their satisfaction over the 
desire of the Bolivian Government to strengthen and enlarge its 
links with Mercosur. 
  They believe it is necessary to meet the request of the 
Bolivian Government and invite its representatives to attend 
meetings of the subgroups as observers. 
  Priority will be given to an agreement to be signed with 
Bolivia in accordance with the proposal mentioned in Paragraph 
13. 
  15. The presidents express satisfaction over the enforcement 
of NAFTA and hope that this agreement will effectively 
contribute to create new trade and investment in the hemisphere, 
considering the need to encourage the talks that started within 
the "four plus one" agreement. 
  16. Evaluating the international economic situation, the 
presidents endorse the recent conclusion of the Uruguay Round of 
the GATT which reinforced the multilateral trade system and the 
creation of the World Trade Organization to implement the 
agreements reached. They express satisfaction over the 
coordination of actions between Mercosur countries and highlight 
the need to strengthen this in the immediate future to help 
eliminate the distortions and protectionist barriers affecting 
world trade. 
  17. The presidents express satisfaction with the important 
progress in the cooperation with the EC, especially through the 
CEFIR [expansion unknown] and developments within the framework 
of the inter-institutional agreement with the European 
communities, specifically on issues related to customs, 
technical regulations, agriculture, and support for the Mercosur 
Administrative Secretariat and Special Funds. 
  They emphasize the results obtained since the launch of the 
first six-month program of the non-reimbursable technical 
cooperation agreement signed with the Inter-American Development 
Bank, and the importance of continuing to cooperate with that 
organization. 
  18. They express interest in the activities to support the 
progress of regional integration within the framework of the 
United Nations Development Program and suggest that all 
developing countries that are members of the system should 
benefit from the different mechanism of cooperation.

  [Text] Mexico City, 19 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Mexico and Colombia 
have been elected members of the Council of the Organization for 
the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Opanal), 
the Mexican Foreign Secretariat announced today. 
  The election to a four-year term was conducted during 
Opanal's eighth extraordinary period of sessions, which was held 
at the Foreign Secretariat's conference room and chaired by 
Deputy Foreign Secretary Rosario Green. 
  At that forum, the official noted new Opanal Chairman 
Enrique 
Roman Morey's willingness to see that the continental agreements 
against the arms race are fully enforced, and he pledged to 
foster peace on the continent. 
  Green stressed that Argentina's and Chile's adherence to the 
Tlatelolco Treaty helped Opanal oversee the faithful compliance 
of this pact, which calls for banning nuclear weapons in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. 
  At the conclusion of the meeting, Ambassador Green hosted a 
lunch in honor of outgoing Opanal Chairman Antonio Stempel 
Paris, at which she noted his dedication and effort to free the 
continent of nuclear weapons. She recalled that the Mexican 
Government has granted top priority to achieving this goal.

<F P=106> [Report by Dolores Rugama] </F>
  [Text] Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo stated yesterday 
that the $40 million disbursement [of U.S. aid] "will boost this 
year's economic program," since it will raise the country's 
reserves and foster confidence among businessmen. Lacayo met 
yesterday with members of the American Chamber of Commerce and 
affirmed that businessmen, rather than creating problems, think 
of opportunities for greater cooperation between government and 
business for the benefit of the country. 
  The agenda for the meeting between Lacayo and the 
businessmen 
included topics such as finance, fiscal matters, laws for 
foreign investments, the labor code, and the attention public 
employees give to businessmen. When a reporter asked him if the 
four deputy presidency ministers were named to pave the way for 
his presidential campaign, he replied, somewhat annoyed, that 
"to talk of a campaign in 1994 is irresponsible. I hope I am not 
asked that question again." 
  He was satisfied that the National Assembly began work with 
great stability, overcoming a year and a half of conflict. He 
also noted that a renewed Supreme Court of Justice will give a 
great boost to the Judicial Branch. Business leader Carlos 
Reynaldo Lacayo indicated that great stress was placed during 
the meeting on the need to promote investments so that at the 
start of 1996 "we will have a well consolidated free enterprise 
system." 
  Banaexpo [expansion unknown] Manager Gilberto Wong stated 
that businessmen asked Lacayo for a general revision to allow 
banks more flexibility with fewer restrictions. The bankers 
demanded a nondiscriminatory banking system, "because we have 
watched with concern the large withdrawals by autonomous 
entities to be put into state banks." 
  This measure, according to Wong, can cause serious 
inconveniences to the financial system, since it restricts 
credit and makes operations more costly.

<F P=106> [From the "Five O'clock Sharp" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpt] The National Transportation Commission's threats 
of a possible strike next Monday have generated fear among 
Managua residents. Today we learned through a Transportation 
and Communications Ministry communique that Presidency Minister 
Antonio Lacayo has downplayed the National Transportation 
Commission's threats. Lacayo clearly said that meetings would 
be held on Monday afternoon. The community is afraid because 
everyone knows the type of actions that are carried out in 
conjunction with the Parales Vallejos cooperative. The people 
are distressed and afraid that there will be bloodshed as a 
result of the National Transportation Commission's threats. 
  We have here Francisco Silva, president of the Nicaraguan 
Chamber of Transportation; Ivan Martinez, executive secretary; 
and Ramon Huertas Herrera, secretary of local and international 
relations. Huertas Herrera will tell us of the Nicaraguan 
Chamber of Transportation's position in light of these threats. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Good afternoon, 
Ramon Huertas Herrera. 
  [Huertas Herrera] We want to clear up some names that could 
cause confusion. For example, what is the National 
Transportation Commission? Some people could become confused 
and think that the National Transportation Commission is an 
organization that groups the whole sector, the entire Nicaraguan 
transportation sector. That is not true. There is also the 
National Transportation Chamber, which groups another 
transportation sector; Fetracolnic [Nicaraguan Federation of 
Collective Transportation], which is a federation of collective 
transportation; and Fetracanic [Nicaraguan Federation of Cargo 
Transportation], which groups everyone in local and 
international freight transportation. There is also the 
Nicaraguan Chamber of Transportation, which is the one we 
represent. All of these organizations make up the transitory 
National Council of Transportation. 
  The National Transportation Commission is promoting the 
strike called for Monday. The entire transportation sector is 
not calling for a strike on Monday. Some transportation 
organizations are calling for a strike, such as the National 
Transportation Commission. The Parales Vallejos Cooperative, 
the 110 Route, and some taxi cooperatives are part of that 
commission. Those cooperatives are promoting the strike on 
Monday. If you recall, the recent past strike that was 
initiated with a protest requesting the elimination of the IGV 
[general sales tax] and the halt in the rise of fuel prices for 
the remainder of 1993 degenerated into what was called a 
rebellion. The rebellion resulted in two fatalities, a fact 
still very much alive in the minds of Nicaraguans, particularly 
capital residents. 
  As the Nicaraguan Chamber of Transportation, which groups 
many organizations, cooperatives, private passenger 
transportation companies, freight companies, and taxis, we do 
not support the strike because we know what it will become. The 
capital residents probably still vividly recall the disorder and 
how all of that got started. It began with small barricades, 
followed by burning tires, then the barricades became trenches 
from where shots and mortars were fired. Private and public 
property was destroyed, the windows of vehicles on the streets 
were broken. There was a series of disturbances that projected 
a very negative image of Nicaraguans. 
  Therefore, we think that the government's timing to increase 
fuel prices was the worst possible. They [not further 
identified] were not working, they were on vacation. That was 
at the end of last year. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Elsa Suarez; from the "National" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Taiwanese Government has decided to pardon 75 
percent of Nicaragua's debt to Taiwan. The release of a 
$30-million loan, which will be allocated to the 
agricultural-livestock sector, has also been announced. Here is 
Maria Elsa Suarez with a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Suarez] The pardon of 75 percent of the 
Nicaraguan debt by the Taiwanese Government is equivalent to $16 
million. 
  [Lim Ki Seng, Taiwanese ambassador in Nicaragua] The 
negotiation to pardon the overdue debt is almost finished. We 
have decided to pardon 75 percent--more than $16 million--of the 
overdue debt. The remainder would be some $5 million. 
  [Suarez] He said the $30-million loan, which will be 
allocated to the agricultural-livestock sector, will be arriving 
in Nicaragua soon. Nicaragua is a magnet for Taiwanese private 
investors, as reflected through the opening of the Fortec 
[expansion unknown] factory and the future opening of a textile 
factory in the duty-free area. Taiwanese investors also own 80 
percent of the Intercontinental Hotel, in which they plan to 
build new installations. More Taiwanese private investors, who 
are interested in the fishing sector, will arrive on 23 January. 
  [Lim] Investors will come to investigate and [words 
indistinct] fishing and pisciculture activities. They will only 
stay in Nicaragua for four days, because they are touring three 
Latin America countries. They will visit Colombia and 
Argentina after Nicaragua. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Gilberto Rodriguez Rugama] </F>
  [Excerpt] Esteli -- Urgent. Sporadic clashes between the 
Sandinist People's Army [EPS] and remnant groups of the 
dismantled 3-80 Northern Front [NF 3-80] continue in the 
mountains Region 1. There have been seven encounters that left 
21 casualties, including dead and wounded, during the first 20 
days of 1994. 
  Major Maximo Zeledon, commander of the EPS 1st Command, has 
reported that the recent confrontations took place in El 
Zungano, El Chipole, Jabalines in Quilali, San Jeronimo in 
Jicaro, and other areas in the mountains of Murra and San Juan 
del Rio Coco. He added that nine recontras had been killed and 
the same number wounded during those actions. Likewise, the 
military commander regretted that two EPS members had been 
killed in combat and one had been wounded. The latter is 
currently out of danger and improving satisfactorily, he added. 
  Zeledon revealed that there had only been casualties in the 
clashes at San Jeronimo, Jicaro, and Chipote, Quilali. He said 
no rebel or EPS casualties resulted from the other clashes. 
<H5>  Criminal Activities </H5>
  The military commander reported that there are currently 
approximately 150 rebels scattered in small groups. He added 
that the rebels are mainly engaged in criminal activities and 
that their actions negatively affect the civilians who live or 
travel in the rural areas, especially in the San Juan del Rio 
Coco, Quilali, Jicaro, Murra, and Ciudad Antigua regions. 
  He pointed out that the chieftains of the remnant NF 3-80 
groups are El Vengador, Magnum, Martin Negro, Franklin, Flecha, 
Carlos 19, Otoniel, Coyote, and others. Zeledon said those 
rebels are continuing their criminal activities and are causing 
uncertainty and instability in the rural areas. Thus, the EPS 
will continue to fight them until their criminal actions cease, 
Major Maximo Zeledon added. 
  Due to the military presence in the area and the 
dismantlement of the rebel groups, five recontras have deserted 
in January and surrendered their weapons to the EPS. The 
soldiers have given them security, respected their lives, and 
turned them over to Catholic Church and Human Rights Commission 
representatives and to their respective relatives. 
<H5>  The Surrender of Two Recontras </H5>
  Bishop Juan Abelardo Malta reported receiving former rebels 
Pablo Tercero Sanchez (a) "El Grifo," who is 27 years old and 
originally from Panali in Quilali, and Miguel Angel Rivera 
Rodriguez (a) "Solin," who is 18 years old and originally from 
Caulatu, from the EPS at its 1st Command headquarters in Esteli 
on 19 January. Bishop Malta said the former rebels had taken an 
important, positive step. He added that the rest of the rebels 
should also reenter regular civilian life and continue to fight 
for their country through civic means and not with weapons which 
only bring pain and death to Nicaraguan society. [passage

  [Text] Panama City, 23 Jan (ACAN-EFE) -- The Nationalist 
Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena) elected today Ruben Dario 
Carles, former Panamanian comptroller general, its presidential 
candidate for the 8 May 1994 elections. 
  Carles--whom his opponents have accused of having obstructed 
the disbursement of budget funds for social programs while in 
the Comptroller General's Office--was elected by a majority vote 
at the Molirena national convention held at the convention 
center in the capital. 
  Molirena decided last night to cease supporting the 
government alliance which has led the country since 1989. This 
has prompted Panamanian President Guillermo Endara to announce 
that he will reshuffle his cabinet in view of the possible 
withdrawal of Molirena ministers from the government. 
  The path toward the election of the septuagenarian was 
cleared after Panamanian Vice President Guillermo Ford renounced 
during its convention his aspirations to be the presidential 
candidate for this political group. 
  Guillermo Guijano, the Molirena former housing minister who 
suffered heart problems in the past hours, was chosen first vice 
president candidate, and Tomas Herrera, of the Civic Renewal 
Party (PRC), was chosen for the second vice president slot. 
  Carles will be nominated by new right-wing parties, namely, 
the National Renewal Movement, PRC, and a faction of Popular 
Alliance (AP), led by former Mayor Mayin Correa, which were left 
out of the elections by the Electoral Tribunal (TE). 
  The Arnulfista Party (PA) also held its national convention 
today. This party, to which President Guillermo Endara belongs, 
elected as is presidential candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, 
widow of Arnulfo Arias Madrid, a caudillo and three-time 
Panamanian president. 
  Moscoso, who is a novice in politics, is the sole female 
presidential candidate and will head a new alliance supported by 
the minority Authentic Liberal Party (PLA), the only remaining 
party of the 1989 opposition alliance. 
  PLA leader Arnulfo Escalona was nominated for the slot of 
first vice president, and Jose Teran, of the minority Liberal 
Party (PL), which was part of the previous military government, 
was chosen for the second vice president position. 
  These three parties were joined by other minority groups, 
namely, the Popular Nationalist Party (PNP), Independent 
Democratic Union (UDI), and an AP faction. A reply from the 
National Unity Mission (MUN), which objected to Escalona's 
candidacy, is expected.

  [Text] The Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican 
Movement] party political committee decided unanimously to 
support [former Comptroller General] Ruben Dario Carles' 
presidential candidacy after negotiations to bring about an 
alliance with the Arnulfist Party [PA] failed. 
  Molirena President Alfredo Ramirez indicated that after 
several hours of deliberations the party's political committee 
decided to select Carles as the presidential candidate because 
he represented the best option. 
  Ramirez stated that, unfortunately, conversations with the 
PA 
had not progressed. For several months now Molirena has been 
stating its intention to participate in the May 1994 elections 
with its own candidate. At the same time, Ramirez pointed out 
that Molirena also seeks to occupy the first vice presidency of 
any ticket that supports Carles' candidacy. In order to 
accomplish this, it has designated a commission to prepare a 
list of nominees from which Carles can chose the person most 
suited to occupy the position of first vice president. 
  A Molirena source reported that possible first vice 
president 
nominees include former Labor Minister Jorge Ruben Rosas, former 
Housing Minister Guillermo Quijano, and National Assembly 
President Arturo Vallarino. According to the same source, Carles 
could opt for Guillermo Quijano as first vice president and 
Tomas Herrera, member [and president] of the Civic Renewal Party 
as second vice president. 
  As of today, Ruben Dario Carles' candidacy will be supported 
by three parties: National Renewal, Civic Renewal, and Molirena. 
  Meanwhile, First Vice President Guillermo Ford indicated 
that 
he will continue to carry out his duties as a member of 
President Endara's cabinet. At the same time he accepted the 
Molirena political committee's decision and reiterated that he 
plans to continue being a member of said party. Ford said that 
he will continue serving democracy until 1 September 1994 when 
the new government is expected to be inaugurated. The vice 
president stipulated that together with President Endara he 
expects to guarantee clean and fair elections as an aftermath of 
the administration elected in 1989. 
  On the other hand, it was disclosed that those cabinet 
ministers who are Molirena members have no plans to resign their 
current positions and indicated that they will step down if it 
is specifically requested by President Endara. 
  Molirena is expected to hold its national convention today 
at 
the ATLAPA Convention Center and to ratify the decision made by 
the party's political committee. The party is expected to hold 
internal elections on 30 January to select candidates for 
legislators, corregimiento representatives, mayors, and council 
representatives.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Panama City KW Continente in Spanish at 
2030 GMT on 23 January broadcasts live Ruben Dario Carles' 
speech to the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement (Molirena) 
convention, during which he was elected presidential candidate. 
  Carles starts by saying a political campaign entails hard 
work and that he is willing to work hard, because he is a 
Molirena member and because he will be the first Molirena 
president. He lauds several party officials and gives special 
recognition to the excellent work and courageous position of 
Vice President Guillermo Ford, had earlier renounced his 
presidential aspirations in favor of Carles. 
  Concerning his tour of the interior of the country and talks 
with farmers and ranchers, Carles says: "One of the main 
responsibilities of a serious government is to ensure that there 
is food for the people. Thus, we are going to give all our 
protection, support, and backing to the country's agriculture 
producers. In my talks with them, I have warned them our 
protection cannot be used as an instrument to increase their 
prices and profits. We will give them fair protection, because 
the government has to do all it can to make producers more 
efficient. Our protection will enable them to become more 
efficient and competitive and, thus, offer better prices to 
consumers. To further this end, the government must ensure that 
the cost of supplies and services will be lower, as this will 
allow farmers, ranchers, and agriculture industrialists to be 
more efficient. I have promised that my government would give 
them fair protection--we will not allow abuses or undue price 
hikes--so that they can be competitive. I have promised to give 
them fair protection in the meat, milk, rice, corn, sorghum, 
tomato, and vegetables sectors." 
  Carles goes on to state that he was the country's 
comptroller 
general for four years and that he could not promote 
expenditures or money disbursements. He appraises the positive 
results of his fiscal discipline program but emphasizes that he 
will have other duties once he is president of the Republic. He 
says: "I will improve Panamanians' standard of living. This is 
not done by putting more money into their pockets, rather, 
first, by giving them better services. The government's task 
should be to ensure that Panamanians receive the public services 
that correspond to the effort and money assigned to it by the 
government. I know we will have to change several government 
structures, but we have to make sure that public services are 
being received satisfactorily. This is where the struggle 
against poverty begins. 
  "When the poor people send their children to schools and 
they 
are given sound education, the poor will no longer be poor, 
because they will have hopes and possibilities. Schools are not 
delivering the desired quality of education, and there are 
several reasons for this. Had I and my brothers not gone to 
school, we would still be back in Penonome. Education is what 
made the difference. Education is the great leveler. It gives 
poor people possibilities. The poor who study and take 
advantage of opportunities can get ahead. We are going to give 
sound education. If the government does not make an effort to 
give quality education to its citizens, the poor will continue 
to be poor, and the situation in the country will become 
serious, because they will have no hope. Life has no meaning if 
we are poor and without hope." 
  Carles says: "During the first 100 days of my government, I 
intend to improve public services, and you will all see how 
things will change." 
  He goes on to say: "A government is effective only if it can 
offer jobs to young people and better services to all citizens. 
A government can only do this if it makes decisions, cuts 
excessive autonomy, and does away with small autonomous bodies 
that do not allow government employees to do their jobs 
effectively. I was in Colon the other day and asked an engineer 
why the building of a road was taking so long. He replied: How 
can I advance if IRHE [Institute of Hydraulic Resources and 
Electrification] has not moved the electricity posts so I can 
build my road? How can a government organization jeopardize the 
work of another institution? Do you know what this requires? A 
strong government. Somebody has to make decisions. Either you 
do your work or you go home right away." 
  Carles cites the Panama Canal issue, saying: "We have to 
manage the canal efficiently. You will be given later details 
on what we will do. We have to make good use of the reverted 
lands and assets. We have to resolve the problem of the military 
bases without hesitation or quivering. Omar Torrijos placed us 
under the Pentagon's umbrella. Thus, so-called nationalists 
should stop praising Omar. He died a long time ago and left us 
with this problem. I do not see any problem in establishing 
relations with the United States--something which will be 
convenient and just for Panama--on the issue of the military 
bases." 
  Carles mentions the public debt and says Molirena has worked 
hard to solve this problem, which was left by the past regime. 
He also broaches the problem of security and advocates an 
improved civilian police corps to counter the lack of security 
and to ensure that the country will not return to militarism.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified reporter from Panama City; broadcast </F>
in progress -- live] 
  [Text] ....party President Mireya de Gruber; Arnulfo 
Escalona has been elected candidate to the post of first vice 
president; and Dr. Jose Teran as candidate to the post of second 
vice president. Here is an interview with President Guillermo 
Endara and [Arnulfista Party President] Mireya Moscoso de Gruber. 
  [Begin recording] [Endara] That is my party's decision. I 
must express my profound disappointment with those who were my 
friends in Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement] 
and who enjoyed great friendship, trust, and power during my 
administration. I think they have been ungrateful to the 
Arnulfista Party. I think their attitude of scorn toward the 
Arnulfista Party is similar to what occurred with the Christian 
Democratic Party [PDC] a few years ago. 
  I am deeply hurt because my party has been despised and 
because Mireya Moscoso de Gruber has been despised. She is very 
important to us and to me. Mireya was Arnulfo Arias Madrid's 
wife. She took care of him and helped him. She was his loyal 
and permanent companion. We Arnulfistas love her very much. 
Personally speaking, I love her very much and I must express my 
support for her at this time. 
  [Reporter] Will there be any changes in your government as a 
result of this? 
  [Endara] Those decisions will be made next week. There will 
undoubtedly be changes. [applause] 
  [Reporter] President, what is your opinion of the slate? 
  [Endara] There will be changes. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, what is your opinion of the slate? 
  [Endara] I think the slate is a slate for the people. The 
alliance I tried to achieve, meaning the alliance Arnulfo Arias 
tried to achieve between vested interests and the Panamanian 
people, represented by the Arnulfista Party, worked during my 
government. However, it is obvious that vested interests want to 
usurp power and take complete control. 
  [Reporter] President, do you still believe in political 
miracles? 
  [Endara] What happened today is a political miracle because 
now the people are with the people. 
  [Reporter] Who are these vested interests that want to seize 
power? 
  [Endara] The Panamanian people know who they are, and you 
know who they are. They are vested interests that want to seize 
power. 
  [Reporter] Gentlemen, just a minute please, you are blocking 
the light. Mrs. Mireya, please, your views about the people who 
will accompany you in the slate? 
  [Gruber] This evening, almost at 2100, the Liberal Authentic 
Party [PLA], the Liberal Party, and the Arnulfista Party reached 
an agreement on a slate. We have a doctor, Arnulfo Escalona, a 
man who has worked hard. He is well-known in this country. We 
also have Dr. Teran, a young man, 36 years old, who 
wants...[pauses] who knows this represents a sacrifice but wants 
to work hard for a better Panama. 
  [Reporter] What do you think? What kind of campaign will 
you conduct given that there is a marked division? 
  [Gruber] We...[pauses] our campaign is dedicated to the 
humble people, the poor. We will have nothing to do with any 
party. The Arnulfista Party will start working on Monday, so I 
do not worry about the other parties. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] Liberal Party members have 
traditionally opposed Arnulfista views and positions? 
  [Gruber] Well, we have been working with the PLA since 1984. 
We now have the Liberal Party. We have worked very well with 
the PLA, and I know we will work well with the Liberal Party. 
  [Reporter] Who will be your main adversary? What is the 
outlook? 
  [Gruber] I have always recognized and said that the only 
adversary here is the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party]. The 
other are not, only the PRD. 
  [Reporter] Mrs. Mireya, your opinion about Molirena's 
decision to abandon the alliance? 
  [Gruber] They objected only to one electoral circuit. That 
is why they left. Therefore, I do not think they had a good 
reason. They did not want to be with the Arnulfista Party any 
longer. That was all. [end recording]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections, 
scheduled for 8 May 1994. Source is cited in parentheses 
following each item. 
  Presidential hopeful Ruben Dario Carles said on 8 January 
that should he become president, he would be willing "to 
negotiate keeping U.S. military bases in Panama." Carles said 
"there is a Permanent Neutrality Treaty that allows the United 
States to remain in Panama or intervene in our country if it 
wants to without having to consult Panama to do so." According 
to the presidential hopeful, he would be willing to negotiate an 
agreement that would allow the United States "to stay 10 or 15 
years in Howard [Air Force Base], Rodman [Naval Station], or 
[Fort] Kobbe," provided Panama could export beef, fish, sugar, 
and other products as compensation. (Panama City LA PRENSA in 
Spanish 10 Jan 94 p 7A) 
  After the Arnulfist Party (PA) and the Nationalist Liberal 
Republican Movement (Molirena) broke off negotiations, PA 
President Mireya Moscoso de Gruber announced that conversations 
have been under way for several weeks with leaders of the 
National Unity Mission (MUN) and the Independent Democratic 
Union (UDI) to negotiate an alliance with Moscoso de Gruber as 
the presidential candidate. MUN President Jose Manuel Paredes 
and UDI President Jacinto Cardenas met on 11 January with 
Moscoso de Gruber to discuss details of the presidential slate, 
which must be approved by their respective party conventions 
scheduled for 23 and 30 January. (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94) 
  Meanwhile, presidential candidate Ruben Blades, of the Papa 
Egoro Movement, rejected on 11 January any alliances, as "these 
only obey political interests." Blades said he will not seek 
alliances or give up his presidential aspirations, saying: "I 
cannot transfer the people's support to another person." Blades 
also urged the other political parties to present their 
platforms, inasmuch as only the Papa Egoro Movement has 
presented a government platform. (Panama City Circuito RPC 
Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94) 
  It has also been reported that Guillermo Ford, another 
presidential hopeful, has said the majority of the Molirena 
convention delegates will vote for his nomination on 23 January. 
Ford has reiterated that if he is nominated, "he will not yield 
the presidential nomination to any alliance." Ford has added 
that Molirena, the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), and the 
Solidarity Party will possibly form an alliance and that there 
is no reason to fear the Democratic Revolutionary Party. 
(Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 
94) 
  The Electoral Tribunal magistrates and the Justice and Peace 
Commission members met recently to coordinate their work so that 
the May elections will be held "in an atmosphere of peace and 
calm." Commission member Bishop Jose Luis Lacunza has warned 
that political and social differences "must not be solved 
through violence," and he voiced fears about the many firearms 
in the hands of civilians. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television 
in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94) 
  The Electoral Tribunal on 11 January decided that the 
Popular 
Alliance (AP) will be unable to participate in the May 
elections, rejecting its recognition, as it nullified the 
conventions held by two conflicting factions in October 1993. 
One faction is led by Omayra "Mayin" Correa and her sister, 
Noris Correa, while the other faction is led by Matilde Mendez 
and Tomas Gonzalez. The Electoral Tribunal has said that the 
two factions have violated the Electoral Code several times. 
(Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 12 Jan 94 pp 1A, 8C) 
  PA President Mireya Moscoso de Gruber has disclosed that the 
Authentic Liberal Party (PLA), the UDI, and the AP have 
confirmed they will ally themselves with the PA. The Popular 
Nationalist Party (PNP) and the MUN will reach a decision on 16 
January. Gruber has also said that if Molirena remembers that 
the Arnulfists will head the presidential ticket, "negotiations 
could be resumed." (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 12 
Jan 94 pp 1A, 8C) 
  The AP faction led by Matilde Mendez has appealed the 
Electoral Tribunal's decision not to recognize the party, noting 
that the Tribunal has not fully considered all of the evidence, 
which shows Mrs. Mendez should be recognized as party president. 
Electoral Tribunal Magistrate Guillermo Marquez has announced 
that the tribunal will "study the request for a reconsideration 
of the tribunal's ruling." (Panama City Telemetro Television 
Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 12 Jan 94) 
  Molirena legislators are trying to get one of their two 
presidential hopefuls--Ruben Dario Carles or Guillermo Ford--to 
give up his presidential aspirations. The legislators met on 12 
January with Carles to analyze his candidacy, while they met on 
13 January with Ford to exchange viewpoints. RPC Television has 
learned the legislators are requesting that Ford decline, as 
Carles seems to have more support within the party. 
  Meanwhile, members of the Social Christian Unity Movement, a 
dissident faction within the PDC, insist they will support 
Carles, and they feel that any alliance nominating PDC leader 
Ricardo Arias Calderon does not stand a chance. (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94) 
  Panamanians should be very careful about poll results, and 
these "should be taken with a grain of salt," Tomas Herrera, 
president of the Civic Renewal Party, has said, adding that his 
party has never been included in these polls. (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94) 
  PDC presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon has 
demanded "urgent changes" in various departments of the Attorney 
General's Office; otherwise, drug trafficking "might take over 
this government office." Arias Calderon said the Panamanian 
people seriously mistrust the Attorney General's Office, and the 
president of the Republic must do something. (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94) 
  The PDC presidential candidate, Ricardo Arias Calderon, has 
also said the law enforcing authorities should remain 
apolitical. Arias Calderon has said: "I think it is very 
important that the National Police should stay out of politics." 
The institution was created to protect all Panamanians, Arias 
Calderon said during a meeting with young professionals, 
students, and workers. He also downplayed the results of recent 
polls, adding that 60 percent of the voters are still undecided.

<F P=106> ["Compact Summary" issued by the Panamanian Solidarity Party </F>
of the party's government plan; place and date not given] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Specific Solutions of Needs </H5>
  In the first week of August 1993, in fulfillment of a duty 
toward the people, the founders of the Solidarity Party 
presented to the nation a proposal for a government plan to 
solve the country's serious problems. We hereby reproduce a 
very compact summary of that government platform, copies of 
which have been given to journalists and community leaders. 
<H5>  Creation of Jobs; Professional Training </H5>
  The unemployment rate is worrisome in Panama. The great 
majority of the people agree that the solution of this problem 
concerns everyone. From an economic point of view, this problem 
can be solved by stimulating investment in fields that can 
create a large number of jobs on a short-term basis. A steady 
long-term growth rate is also required. The Solidarity Party 
hereby wishes to describe some of its government platform's 
basic considerations for solving this problem. 
  -- To stimulate the growth of a truly untraditional, 
private-public, commercial development banking, which would give 
impetus to the evolution of the economy's informal sector and 
protect and stimulate this sector to give rise to the 
establishment of small-scale entrepreneurs as a means to create 
jobs on a large-scale basis. 
  -- The private commercial development banking, which should 
be state subsidized in the shortest possible but indefinite 
time, should guarantee the least expensive money for a quick 
replacement of the existing industrial park in the framework of 
technological renovation and efficient industry, which can be 
competitive in the international market, in the understanding 
that market opening and economic integration are the next 
century's great challenges. 
  -- To protect and stimulate the securities market as an 
alternate source of inexpensive financing for local and foreign 
investors. 
  -- To present a plan for the rapid professional and 
technical 
education and training of Panamanian men and women so they can 
aspire to worthy and well-paid jobs. 
  -- To turn the National Institute for Professional Training, 
INAFORP, into a complex technical training center for science, 
technology, services, and tourism. To provide this training 
center with a central information office, which would study the 
regional and overall demand for manpower and its qualification 
levels. The institute's plans and programs would thus meet the 
employers' needs and the population's urgent need for permanent, 
well-paid jobs. 
  -- To transform education, as soon as possible and with the 
appropriate technological knowledge, to meet the need for 
qualified labor required by the economy, thus enabling 
Panamanians to hold jobs created by local and foreign private 
investors. 
  -- To develop and implement a comprehensive program to 
stimulate local and foreign investors throughout the country, 
and to exploit the most important assets that have reverted and 
will revert to Panama through the fulfillment of the Panama 
Canal Treaty. Most of the revenue brought by the exploitation 
of reverted assets will be redistributed in the rest of the 
country, thus giving all Panamanians the economic benefits to 
which they are entitled. 
  -- To update, as soon as possible, all of the sea port and 
airport infrastructures to increase efficiency, security, and 
the international trade confidence in Panamanian services. To 
make sure that the Panamanian labor force is the most capable 
and reliable for local and foreign investors in the 
international market. 
  -- To increase the state's investments in basic 
infrastructure for development and training aimed at private 
investment with methods that can create many jobs. 
  -- To build and maintain accesses to tourism development 
centers. To remove all obstacles that stand in the way of 
investors. To have flexible fiscal legislation and government 
financing to train Panamanian workers so they can work 
efficiently and earn good salaries in the sector. 
  -- To divert economic and financial resources to guarantee 
the employment of a large number of workers. We have resources, 
that are envied by other countries, which we are not being 
exploited and which could make development possible for the 
greater good of all, underlining several tourism variants, such 
as ecological tourism, shopping tourism, beach tourism, historic 
and ethnic tourism. 
  -- To develop and improve the quality of the small arts and 
crafts industry, which supports tourism. The benefits that the 
sector receives should also reach these craftsmen so they can 
develop into small but competitive enterprises. 
  -- To take urgent measures to reduce our limitations in the 
international market, particularly in the Central American 
market, and at least make ourselves felt in two important 
production factors, that is to say, fuel (oil by-products), 
taking international prices into consideration and lowering the 
current tax as much as possible, and debating the current energy 
rate and production costs because these factors hamper 
competitiveness in the international market. 
<H5>  Public Security and Crime </H5>
  We are experiencing a dramatic situation, where crime, drug 
trafficking, and the judicial system's weakness, which results 
from scandals and the public's distrust of the system's 
capability to administer justice honestly and ethically, are 
harming the Panamanian people's social and public security to 
very dangerous degrees. 
  Since crime is essentially the result of three basic 
factors, 
the economic and social situation, the public security level, 
and the moral value system, we intend to carry out the following: 
  -- First of all, and through the democratic system, we will 
incorporate all Panamanians into a great plan for national 
salvation, economic and social development, tolerance, and true 
reconciliation because by raising our social and economic 
expectations we all will be prepared to defend our social and 
political institutions, which represent our genuine aspirations. 
  -- Drug trafficking in Panama is the result of the 
metamorphosis of the drug market in Europe and North America, 
particularly the United States. Dealing with this problem, 
however, does not depend exclusively on the country's 
willingness but on a firm cooperative alliance with the 
international community. For this reason, we will coordinate 
programs with other countries to eradicate criminal 
organizations, drug traffickers, drug consumers, and drug 
distribution networks. 
  -- Without delay, we will reformulate and implement a 
national and public security policy and make the administration 
of justice expeditious. 
  -- In the various international organizations, we will help 
strengthen our society spiritually with development outlooks and 
opportunities based on a new, fair, and democratic world order. 
<H5>  Drug Consumption </H5>
  The increased use of drugs and their deleterious effects on 
a 
traditionally peaceful and civilized society are notorious in 
Panama. For this reason, Solidarity proposes: 
  -- To combat crime through education. This means carrying 
out a program aimed at active and potential criminals, 
increasing their opportunities for work as well as culture, so 
they can be placed in the labor market. To devise instruction 
programs for police authorities to let them know that we will 
combat this scourge through education, work, and culture, thus 
helping put an end to misery and hunger. 
  -- To coordinate with all sectors of the country, 
particularly with the media, a campaign against the culture of 
violence which, disregarding traditional peace and good habits, 
attempts to take root in Panama, encouraging and stimulating 
crime. 
  -- To strengthen the Attorney General's Office and the 
Judicial Branch to correct its vulnerability. 
  -- To integrate in a single organization all services in 
charge of stopping crime, including civic institutions. 
  -- To reinforce the border police, the National Air Service, 
and the National Maritime Service through adequate training, 
equipment, resources, and supervision so they can confront drug 
trafficking organizations successfully. 
  -- To create the community police, incorporating the 
community and its representative organizations in the prevention 
of crime. 
<H5>  Justice and Community </H5>
  Most of the time, criminal cases in the community are 
treated 
as police cases by corregidores, who lack the proper scientific 
approach and training to deal with the complex problem of the 
origin and evolution of crime. Because of this, Solidarity 
proposes the following: 
  -- To train corregidores in properly handling this problem, 
supporting them with interdisciplinary professional teams in 
charge of instructing the Panamanian family to prevent, rather 
than punish, crime by reinforcing the family institution. 
  -- To transform the national prison system to rehabilitate 
criminals. The system should respect human rights and 
effectively reincorporate into civilian society the citizens who 
have served their sentences. 
<H5>  Transportation and Communications </H5>
  Several studies carried out on this will determine the 
possible solutions to the problem of transportation and means of 
communications, establishing a strategy of expanding the network 
of highways that would solve the vehicle traffic problems in 
Panama City into the next century. 
  The possibilities that this network might be built based on 
a 
toll system and with private and mixed enterprises facilitates 
the option for solving the vehicle traffic problem that is 
becoming unbearable. There are economic and social problems 
and, particularly, the family-related problems that the vast 
majority of the public transportation users must endure. This 
is because users must spend up to three hours before and after 
work commuting for no reason other than the huge traffic 
congestions. Therefore, we propose the following: 
  -- Recover the national highway network whose maintenance 
has 
been neglected, mainly the Transisthmian Highway, and widening 
two additional highways. To continue expanding the four lanes 
on the Pan-American highway with views to turning it into a 
freeway all the way to Chiriqui. To build the Colon-Cocle 
highway, Chepo-Darien highway, and the Bocas-Chiriqui highway. 
  -- To develop a network of highway communications in the 
central provinces in order to guarantee an incentive for 
production. 
  -- In the metropolitan area, to build the Northern Corridor, 
the Southern Corridor, or the Coastal Corridor. To develop a 
broad and scientific program of traffic signs, traffic lights, 
widening of streets and avenues, vehicles bypasses, and 
pedestrian bridges. With the participation of private enterprise 
in these projects, we will be able to generate thousands of jobs 
which the Panamanians anxiously await. 
  -- To organize a staggered schedule of public office hours 
and persuade private enterprise to join the same in order to 
prevent traffic congestion and peak hours in public 
transportation. 
  -- To carry out a broad campaign that seeks to change the 
mentality of the drivers. In order to do this, it is important 
to guarantee the participation of the government, civic clubs, 
and the media. There must be a great crusade for the ethical 
and courteous behavior of the population. 
  -- A large amount of the everyday problems that contribute 
to 
traffic congestion are due to the attitude of the drivers, who 
do not practice common courtesy when they drive. Statistics 
show that the lack of driver education or not practicing 
established norms entail sorrow and mourning for many homes. 
Therefore, it is necessary that formal education incorporate 
highway education into its program as a required subject. 
<H5>  The Canal and Use of Reverted Areas </H5>
  The current world outlook indicates the continued importance 
Panama has in communications, transportation, and world trade. 
Therefore, we must assign priority to the process of transition 
toward the control, management, defense, and administration by 
Panama over the Canal and the reverted areas, which are our 
country's greatest asset. 
  Solidarity proposes: 
  Strengthening the governmental institutional mechanisms in 
charge of following up the implementation of the Panama Canal 
Treaty, and granting the administrative and technical support 
that are required by the Panamanian representatives on the Board 
of Directors and the various binational organizations.

  [Text] The Popular Alliance and MINA [National Integration

obviously a discriminatory measure by the Electoral Tribunal 
magistrates. 
  The Electoral Tribunal magistrates' decision is intended to 
deprive our organizations of the right to participate in the 
upcoming elections and thus put us in a disadvantageous position 
compared to other political groups. 
  Being the active organizations we are and based on our legal 
status as political parties involved in their organization 
process, instead of refraining from action, we are issuing an 
appeal to all our supporters, urging them to double their 
efforts, defend our principles, and actively participate in the 
presidential campaign of Professor Ruben Carles and his slate, 
to which we offer our total support. We will thus support the 
Panamanian people's hope for a true change.

  [Text] Panama City, 20 Jan (EFE) -- Panamanian President 
Guillermo Endara told EFE that Panamanian authorities were 
informed and "indirectly" assisted Italian police in dismantling 
one of the main money laundering networks of the Cali Cartel. 
  However, the Panamanian head of state denied Italian reports 
that arrests were made in his country in connection with 
"Unigold" operation, which on Wednesday destroyed a network that 
laundered $100 million monthly from the sale of Colombian 
cocaine in the United States through large amounts of gold sent 
to Panama. 
  In statements to EFE, Endara said that according to the 
security reports he has received, an international operation was 
conducted with the participation of Italian police, and although 
Panama "was not directly involved, it was kept informed of the 
situation by other agencies." 
  The cooperation, Endara added, was "at the level of 
information," which the Italians did not request directly but 
received through unidentified organizations. 
  Endara said he does not believe that these kinds of 
drug-related activities affect the international image of 
Panama, whose international banking system and Free Trade Zone 
have been considered by U.S. counternarcotics experts as "very 
vulnerable" to money laundering. 
  "This happens in all countries, and we always cooperate when 
asked," the president stressed. 
  According to reports by authorities, the network dismantled 
in Italy was led by Colombian citizen Gustavo Jesus Upegui 
Delgado, former accountant of late Medellin Cartel chief Pablo 
Escobar and currently one of the main financial leaders of the 
"Cali Cartel." Upegui has been arrested in Vicenza (northeast 
part of the country). Seven Italian businessmen were arrested in 
Vicenza and Arezzo on charges of participating in the money 
"laundering" network. 
  Reports from Italy said that four other unidentified people 
were arrested in Panama, but Endara asserted that no arrests had 
been made in his country in connection with "Unigold" operation. 
  Italian authorities began the investigation last June after 
receiving a lead from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
(DEA). 
  According to reports from Italy, the dismantled gang used 
"narcodollars" to buy some 1,000 kg of gold bars per month, 
which were sent to Panama, where they were resold and the 
"laundered" money wired to the Cali Cartel in Colombia. 
  Alessandro Pansa, director of the operation and one of the 
individuals responsible for the Central Operation Center of 
Italy's Criminal Police, said in his country that the 
trafficking operations were so large that they threatened to 
alter the gold market. 
  Endara said that unlike other countries, Panama does not 
control the sale of gold, which "comes and goes without a 
problem." 
  Italian investigators identified three corporations, all 
based in Arezzo, as the owners of bank accounts where the 
"narcodollars" were sent. The corporations are Simar Joyeros 
Mayoristas, which has an outlet in Panama, Aurea Trading 
International, and Eurocatene. 
  Panamanian sources at Simar Joyeros Mayoristas told EFE that 
their corporation had not participated in any drug money 
laundering operation, that no employee had been arrested, and 
that last year an investigation conducted by the Panamanian 
Customs Directorate cast no doubts on the corporation's 
activities. 
  According to government sources, the jewelry corporation in 
Panama is owned by Saul Schwartz, a Jewish businessman who on 1 
June was kidnapped under strange circumstances by unidentified 
individuals who released him uninjured after an unspecified 
ransom was paid through a rabbi.

  [Text] Supreme Court Magistrate Carlos Lucas Lopez handed 
his letter of resignation to President Guillermo Endara, which 
is to take effect on 1 May. Lopez added that he shared the view 
that Oswaldo Fernandez should remain the National Police 
director until after the elections are over. In his letter 
Lopez informs Endara that he is resigning for strictly personal 
reasons and requests that he make it effective on 1 May, the 
date when he will have completed a two-month vacation he had 
requested from the Supreme Court of Justice plenum. 
  Lopez said that he joined the Supreme Court of Justice at 
the 
request of President Endara that he cooperate with the country's 
material, moral, and institutional reconstruction after a 
"prolonged dictatorship and the outcome of violence outcome that 
brought it to an end." 
  Magistrate Lopez said that he will be in the Supreme Court 
Civil Court until 28 February, when he will then take his 
two-month vacation. He added that he shares the feelings of a 
great number of citizens and even political parties that 
Fernandez' appointment should take place after the May 1994 
elections.

  [Text] Caracas, 29 Jan (AFP) -- Several disturbances 
affected the Venezuelan capital at noon today. The 
demonstrators are protesting against an increase in 
transportation fares and the sales tax, although the application 
of the latter at the consumer level was postponed until 28 
February, media sources here reported. 
  Disturbances started near the Central University of 
Venezuela 
(UCV), in the strategic east-central Caracas area, where hooded 
students burned a soft drink company truck, and in secondary 
schools and higher education institutions in central and 
southwestern Caracas. 
  Capital city firefighters showed up to extinguish the fire 
caused by the truck torching at the UCV and members of the 
metropolitan police special brigade fired tear gas at the 
students, who responded with rocks. 
  The disturbances spread to the Fermin Toro Secondary school 
in downtown Caracas and to the Caballero Mejias Higher Education 
Center, in the populous area of La Yaguada, in the southwest, 
where residents joined the action to protest utility problems. 
The students protested against an increase in public 
transportation fares, especially the student fare, and against a 
sales tax although its implementation was postponed. 
  On 18 January the increase in transportation fares led to 
violent student demonstrations in Puerto La Cruz, 220 km east of 
Caracas, where classes at universities were suspended in the 
wake of looting that led to the arrest of 100 persons, and in 
Charallave, 50 km to the south. The student protest, which was 
characterized by the burning of tires and closure of streets, 
spread to Cumana, 350 km to the east, Maturin, 400 km to the 
east, and to the Andean city of San Cristobal, 648 km to the 
southwest.

enduring riots since last week. Today rioting spread into 
Caracas. There also were violent demonstrations near the
