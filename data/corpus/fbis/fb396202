<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] AL-BA'TH discusses the meeting between Presidents 
al-Asad and Clinton, scheduled for mid-January in Geneva. The 
projected summit has already caught the attention of Middle East 
watchers and Arab and world media. The consensus is that the 
fate of the entire Middle East peace process hangs on the 
outcome of the Geneva summit. AL-BA'TH notes the importance 
that the United States attaches to the Geneva summit and cites a 
statement to that effect by Warren Christopher. The paper also 
quotes U.S. Administration officials as expressing the hope the 
session will propel the peace process forward and Washington's 
assertion that it will continue to work for a comprehensive 
peace. 
  Arab and world media are agreed that Syria's posture on the 
peace process is the right one. They point out that Middle East 
security and stability are inconceivable while a chunk of Arab 
territory remains under Israeli occupation. AL-BA'TH stresses 
that the world, and the United States in particular, realizes 
that, without the involvement of Syria and Lebanon, peace in the 
Middle East stands no chance. It counsels wariness of Israel's 
procrastination and insistence on separate and partial deals. 
Syria, the paper emphasizes, will have absolutely nothing to do 
with partial and separate deals, as such a course will heighten 
tension in the region. Syria wants a comprehensive peace founded 
on UN resolutions and the Madrid formula, AL-BA'TH concludes. 
  AL-THAWRAH comments on escalating Israeli attacks on south 
Lebanon, seeing the action within the context of a strategy to 
use the volatile situation as a bargaining chip and lever to 
apply pressure on Lebanon. The Rabin government, using an iron 
fist to blackmail Lebanon, deal with it in isolation from other 
Arab states, and force it into signing a separate agreement, is 
out to undermine coordination among Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan. 
The idea is to weaken the Arab position and pave the way for 
Israel to deal with each of the three tracks separately and 
subsequently dictate its terms and own solutions. Coming two 
weeks before the the summit between al-Asad and Clinton, the 
attacks are seen by the paper as a bid to whip up tension and 
deflect the session from its declared objective of giving an 
impetus to the peace process and promoting a just and 
comprehensive settlement along the lines of the Madrid formula 
and pertinent UN resolutions. 
  The responsibility of the international community and the 
American sponsors cannot be overstated. Both must use their 
clout, be firm, and rein in Israel lest it get carried away by 
its aggressive bent. They must bring about enough pressure to 
force an Israeli pullout of south Lebanon, the Golan Heights, 
and other occupied Arab territory as envisaged by UN resolutions 
-- the underpinnings of a fair and comprehensive peace, 
AL-THAWRAH concludes.

  [Text] The first official round of talks between Mr. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Mr. Saparmurad Niyazov, presidents of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkmenistan, was held on Sunday [2 
January] evening. 
  At the meeting, Mr. Niyazov thanked the officials of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran for their warm hospitality and 
explained that the aim of his trip to Iran is to benefit from 
our country's successful experiences and to find new ways for 
expanding bilateral relations in a new era of cooperation 
between the two countries. 
  The president of Turkmenistan emphasized the religious, 
cultural, and historical features shared by the two countries 
and noted that Iran is a country with an ancient history and 
civilization. He said: Turkmenistan wishes to have wider 
cultural links with the Islamic Republic of Iran. He expressed 
the hope that Turkmenistan's cultural experts will use the 
existing historical and cultural works in Iran's libraries and 
educational centers to compile that country's history. 
  Mr. Niyazov said in connection with the Ashgabat meeting: 
With the establishment of a climate of friendship and 
understanding between neighboring and regional countries, the 
growing trend of cooperation between Turkmenistan and the 
Islamic Republic of Iran will also accelerate. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, for his part, referred to the 
composition of Turkmenistan's high-ranking delegation and said 
that this delegation's trip provides a good opportunity for 
fulfilling the aims of widening relations between the two 
countries. He added: Because Iran and Turkmenistan are 
neighbors, both countries desire deep and friendly relations; 
and the visits paid by high-ranking officials of the two 
countries to Tehran and Ashgbat have been instrumental in 
serving this objective. 
  The president pointed to the existence of land and sea 
borders between the two countries in the Khorasan, Gilan, and 
Mazendaran Provinces, adding: These provinces, which have 
suitable natural and geographical features, can play a 
fundamental role in the growth of trade and economic exchanges 
between the two countries. He stressed the role of the joint 
commission between the two countries in the development of 
relations and cooperation and noted the need for the creation of 
facilities in the area of transport and travel for the purposes 
of exchanges of views and experiences between commercial and 
economic experts of Iran and Turkmenistan. 
  The talks were also attended by the two countries' ministers 
of foreign affairs, culture, commerce, post, telegraph and 
telephone, transport, and agriculture, and a number of other 
officials. It was decided at the talks that committees will be 
formed with the involvement of experts on political matters, 
transport and communications, economics, commerce, education, 
training, health, agriculture, fisheries, gas and oil, and 
culture and tourism. After discussion and debate, the committee 
experts are to convey the results to the presidents of Iran and 
Turkmenistan.

  [Text] Tehran, Dec. 29, IRNA -- Azeri Foreign Minister 
Gasan Gasanov heading a delegation arrived here Wednesday [29 
December] and was greeted by his Iranian counterpart 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati. 
  Gasanov told IRNA at the airport that the objective of his 
visit was to exchange views with Iranian officials on holy 
places in Karabakh demolished by Armenian forces. 
  Gasanov noted that the Armenian forces have strenghtened 
their positions in Karabakh and rejected Azeri proposals to 
evacuate the occupied areas. 
  "We are confident that the Armenians are not willing to 
solve 
the dispute through peaceful means," said the Azeri minister. 
  Regretting the demolition of holy places, including several 
mosques in the occupied territories, Gasanov urged Iran to join 
his country in following up the matter in the next summit meet 
of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC). 
  Velayati said the commonalities between Iran and Azerbaijan 
required exchange of higher level visits at closer intervals. 
  The belligerent sides as well as the neighboring countries 
should take measures to end the regretful war between Azerbaijan 
and Armenia, Velayati said. 
  Following up the letters of understanding signed between the 
two sides during President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani's trip 
to Baku, regional cooperation especially at Caspian Sea as well 
as economic coopevation are among topics discussed between 
Gasanov and Iranian officials.

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani this afternoon received 
Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov of Azerbaijan. In the meeting, 
the president expressed concern over the fate of the people of 
Azerbaijan, especially those who live in the war-hit areas. He 
said: The war that is currently in progress in Nagorno-Karabakh 
and along the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia cannot be 
justified by any international norms and conventions, and 
fanning the flames of this war will not be in the interests of 
any country in the region or the world. The president stressed: 
The atrocious living conditions of the women and children 
refugees of Azerbaijan in the cold areas on the borders make it 
absolutely necessary that international organizations pay 
greater attention to the fate of these people. 
  Moreover, Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the fact that from 
the early days of the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, 
Iran had foreseen its bitter consequences and made efforts to 
find a peaceful solution to the dispute. He added: At present, 
too, on the basis of its humanitarian principles, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has provided shelter on the border areas to 
thousands of oppressed and helpless Azerbaijani refugees. Iran 
has done all it can to remedy the suffering of these refugees, 
and will continue to do so. 
  In this meeting, Gasanov, in turn, expressed the gratitude 
of 
the president, government, and the people of Azerbaijan for the 
humanitarian aid given to the Azeri refugees by the government 
and nation of Iran. Furthermore, he presented a report about 
the latest developments in Azerbaijan, particularly the crisis 
areas on the border with Armenia. 
  Earlier today, Gasanov also met and conferred with our 
country's foreign minister, 'Ali Akbar Velayati.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Reports received from various news sources indicate 
heavy clashes between jehadi groups in Afghanistan. The 
severity of the fighting and the volume and types of arms used 
show that the fighting is unprecedented since the conquest of 
Kabul and the fall of Najibollah's regime. Also, the inhuman 
dimensions of the fighting -- shelling of residential areas, 
hospitals, and even safe areas such as embassies -- are proof 
that hostilities have gone beyond their usual, controllable 
state and have put Afghanistan on the brink of a new catastrophe. 
  The recent clashes come when diplomatic efforts are under 
way 
to end the internal crisis in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the 
clashes plunge the horizon for peace into uncertainty. 
  Each of the jehadi groups considers the unfair distribution 
of power in Afghanistan to be the cause of the fighting. The 
Afghan Mojahedin, who successfully put a 14-year-long holy war 
behind them and have managed to put on show one of the most 
brilliant victories, are now finding difficulty in consolidating 
sovereignty. The main Afghan difficulty in this respect is the 
lack of unified leadership, which is acceptable by all parties 
and groups. That problem resulted in bloody clashes right from 
the beginning of the mojahedin coming to power, without the 
battles putting an end to the crisis. It would seem that two 
years of bloody fighting -- which have left nothing but 
destruction in Afghanistan -- would be a good experience for 
those political and military Afghan groups that seek to resolve 
the crisis through military means. 
  The balance of power among the groups and the rapid change 
in 
alliances and coalitions prevent progress through military 
means. Political analysts believe that peace and tranquillity 
will not return to Kabul unless the Afghan jehadi groups put the 
interests of their state and people before factional interests 
and choose a peaceful path, put down their arms and arm 
themselves instead with the weapon of logic, and then embark on 
instituting a constitution. 
  The history of world movements and revolutions shows the 
constitution in any state to be one of its main pillars and 
guarantees its survival. The constitution must be formulated by 
the votes of all the people of Afghanistan. Only in such a 
situation can one hope for future peace and tranquillity there. 
Therefore, if the Afghan political and military groups do not 
quickly pave the way for talks in order to control the current 
crisis, opportunists will impose conditions from outside on the 
pretext of supporting human rights and establishing peace and 
stability in Afghanistan. In that case the real loser will be 
the Afghan nation and the 14-year-old aspirations of their holy 
jihad will be threatened.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 3, IRNA -- Two Iranian dailies Monday 
[3 January] commented in their editorials on the current clashes 
in Kabul and called for mediations to end the fighting which is 
going to root out the nation's properties. 
  The English daily `TEHRAN TIMES' called for an immediate 
summit meeting of regional countries including Iran, Pakistan 
and some others with influence in Afghanistan. 
  It said that the meet would be aimed to "chalk out a plan 
for 
free and fair elections which is a must and that many believe 
can silence the guns." 
  The editorial considered as insufficient whatever the 
neighboring countries have done so far to bring peace to the 
country stressing that "a concrete step should be taken." 
  The Persian daily `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' said that impartial 
people who are trusted by the Afghan nation should enter the 
scene to narrow the gap in the viewpoints of the jihad groups 
and to extinguish the flames of wrath which would eliminate the 
properties of the Afghan nation. 
  It also expressed surprise that some of the jihad groups 
have 
shown such a strong will to remove their rivals.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan 2, IRNA -- An official of Iran's Foreign

Iran has had any contact with November 17th group, a terrorist 
group in Greece. 
  Director General of the Department of Western European 
Affairs at the Foreign Ministery, Ali Ahani, today denied the 
Italian daily CORRIERRE DELLA SERA's recent report on Iran's 
alleged contacts with certain members of a Greek terrorist group

  [Text] The second round of talks between the Palestinian 
and Israeli delegations which was held in Cairo has concluded. 
  While several differences between the two sides continue to 
remain unresolved, the delegations have returned to Tunisia and 
occupied Palestine in order to consult with their leaders. 
  The Zionist regime foreign minister, Shim'on Peres, who 
headed the Israeli delegation at the Cairo talks, says that 
certain proposals regarding three basic differences mainly the 
area of Ariha [Jericho], the issue of controlling the passages, 
and the security issues have been offered to the Palestinian 
delegation and that is now up to the Palestinian leaders to 
accept or to reject them. 
  On the other hand the Palestinian officials say that the 
proposals put forward by the Israeli delegation do not fulfill 
even the minimum of the Palestinians' requirements and that 
Israel is not willing to accept the handing over to Egypt and 
Jordan the control of the passages in the Gaza-Jericho regions 
and the area of Jericho. 
  The presentation of such contradictory viewpoints 
undoubtedly 
speak of the basic differences between the two sides that have 
not yet been removed. This is at a time when the Tel Aviv 
regime and the Egyptian leaders are trying to project the trend 
of the talks as positive and constructive covering the deep 
differences present between the two sides. 
  There are three main issues over which the Israeli and 
Palestinian delegates differ. According to a document presented 
by the Palestinians, Jericho has an area of 342 sq km; that is 
the area of the Jericho region prior to the occupation of the 
West Bank in 1967. The Zionist regime says that the region has 
an area of 25 sq km, and Shim'on Peres' proposal to the 
Palestinians has doubled it to 50 sq km. On the control of the 
border regions too, the only solution which Israel offers is 
that certain border regions should be jointly controlled under 
the supervision of the two sides. But on the security issues 
and the Jewish settlements the Tel Aviv officials say that they 
will give no concessions to the Palestinians. 
  Under the current circumstances it seems that despite the 
fact that main differences between the two sides have remained 
unresolved, the Zionist regime and certain Arab countries such 
as Egypt on the one hand want the talks to continue and on the 
other project the differences and the obstacles created by the 
Zionist regime as minor. This is at a time when the presidents 
of Syria and the United States are expected to have a meeting in 
mid-January. 
  Undoubtedly deadlock in the talks between the Palestinians 
and the Zionist regime will not be to the benefit of the Tel 
Aviv officials who were seeking separate deals with each of the 
other sides. 
  At any rate this time too, despite the optimism being shown 
in connection with the Cairo talks, it is fully clear that 
against any concessions given to the Palestinian delegation by 
Israel, it will try to get a far bigger concession from them and 
world opinion will once again witness the fact that the usurper 
regime of Israel does not implement the agreement that it has 
itself signed.

  [Text] Dispatches report that late Thursday December 30, 
the Zionist regime and Vatican signed an agreement on political 
ties and establishing diplomatic relations between them. 
  The Israeli deputy foreign minister, Yosi Beilin, and his 
Vatican counterpart, Bishop Claudio Celli, signed this documents 
which has 15 articles. 
  This said agreement will become official after its 
ratification by the parliament of the Zionist regime and pope, 
the leader of the world Catholics. The two sides will then 
exchange ambassadors. 
  The signing of this agreement between Vatican and the 
Zionist 
regime is considered by political analysts as an important 
development in Vatican's policy toward Israel. 
  Following the end of the war of oil in the Persian Gulf and 
the beginning of Middle East peace talks, Vatican started 
extensive efforts to have presence in these talks. 
  However, the Zionist regime had set establishment of 
official 
relations as a condition for Vatican's presence in the talks. 
  Nevertheless the establishment of the diplomatic relations 
between the two sides was an obstacle in view of Vatican's 
policy toward the Zionist regime. 
  Vatican, too, considered the implementation of the 1947 UN 
resolution in which the international administration of Bayt 
al-Muqaddas [Jerusalem] had been envisaged as the prerequisite 
for establishing relations with Israel. 
  However, international conditions over the past couple of 
years have been such that Vatican seems to have withdrawn from 
its position. 
  In the document signed by Vatican and the Zionist regime, no 
reference has been made to Bayt al-Muqaddas, while Vatican has 
rejected the issue of Jesus Christ's betrayal by the Jews. 
  In this relation the spokesman of Vatican, while referring 
to 
the unnecessary nature of the implementation of the UN 
resolution, stressed that the Catholic Church no longer supports 
UN resolutions on Bayt al-Muqaddas. 
  In the meantime, in the document signed by Vatican and 
Israel, the question of freedom of religion in harmony with the 
laws of the Jewish state has been envisaged. Nevertheless this 
issue has not reduced worries that the Jewish state may treat 
Christian sects from a superior position. 
  On this basis, recognition of Israel by Vatican has caused a 
negative reaction among Christian sects with the retreat of 
Vatican policy toward the issue. 
  In the meantime, although the White House has welcomed 
Vatican's recognition of the Zionist regime, this issue has been 
condemned by the opposition Palestinian organizations and 
parties. 
  The two Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of 
Palestine in a joint statement have announced that under the 
conditions that the suppression of the Palestinian nation still 
continues, this recognition will not help to end Palestinian and 
Arab territories' occupation by the Zionist regime. 
  Political analysts believe that in the view of the nature of 
the Zionist regime and the Jewish state's performance since the 
occupation of Palestine, which are based on superiority of Jews, 
religious discrimination, and rejection of other religious 
minorities and faiths, recognition of Israel by Vatican is 
considered as a mere political move and one can not conceive any 
worthy role for Vatican in this connection.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Ban Nuclear Weapons"] </F>
  [Text] United Nations Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
has just visited Pyongyang, capital of North Korea. 
  Lately the United States has been pressuring international 
agencies to persuade North Korea to allow inspection of its 
facilities and has even threatened to nuke North Korea if they 
ever built and used one. Butrus-Ghali was on a mission to 
intercede between the U.S. and North Korea. North Korea has not 
accepted the International Atomic Energy Agency's request to 
inspect its facilities and considers its nuclear activitis to be 
peaceful and regards U.S. attempts as bullying moves of 
intimidation. 
  What is unfortunate is that the secretary general of the 
United Nations is putting himself at the disposal of one of its 
members, namely the United States. 
  This is an important and opportune occasion (the birth of 
Jesus Christ); the secretary general should have considered 
other places. For instance, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
cries for intervention of an international body. Butrus-Ghali 
could have visited Serbia to put pressure on Serbs to end the 
genocide and massacre of innocent people. 
  The question of nuclear weapons should worry any 
conscientious individual. Weapons of such destructive powers 
are no toys for any military. Only the United States has used 
this weapon (in World War II). The Islamic Republic of Iran has 
maintained that its nuclear activities are peaceful and 
representatives of international agencies have repeatedly 
confirmed this. 
  Governments with nuclear capability claim to be stable and 
promise to take measures to control its military use. The 
former Soviet Union was such a stable government. When 
President Reagan was shot, the confusion in the White House as 
to "Who is in control!" testified to another stable government. 
  Conscientious individuals in the world have been rallying to 
ban nuclear weapons. Iran also believes that since nuclear 
weapons are dangerous and destructive, and that they could get 
out of control and create a world disaster, no country should 
have them.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Some optimistic analysts say 
that the recent agreement between Washington and Pyongyang is a 
positive step toward improving ties and believe that the 
direction of the negotiations is toward the resolution of the 
crisis on the Korean peninsula. 
  But other analysts, who look deeper into issues, believe 
that 
despite such an agreement still no clear outlook can be seen in 
the U.S.-North Korean relations and no end can be seen to the 
crisis in the Korean peninsula. Those analysts believe that the 
strain in ties between America and North Korea does not end with 
the issues of the inspection of the North Korean nuclear 
installations and ending of the U.S.-South Korean military 
maneuvers. The problem is that America, within the framework of 
the theory of the new world order, does not want any country but 
those which support U.S. interests to have access to nuclear 
arms. At the same time, North Korea believes that this American 
strategy is against its security and national interests. 
  A more worrying point is that there are still a number of 
the 
so-called minor differences that could expand into bigger 
differences in the two countries' relations at any moment. 
  Pyongyang is concerned that after the inspection of the 
North 
Korean nuclear installations, Washington will continue its 
hostile policies to bring North Korea in line with U.S. 
policies, as it has done in the case of many other countries. 
For example, the International Atomic Energy Agency has 
repeatedly inspected Iranian nuclear installations and has 
assessed its inspections as positive and believes that Iran is 
using nuclear energy solely for peaceful purposes. Yet at the 
same time, America has repeatedly accused Iran of using it for 
military purposes. 
  Pessimism over the agreements reached between Washington and 
Pyongyang became more evident when North Korean President Kim 
Il-sung yesterday announced that even though such agreements can 
solve the existing differences on North Korean nuclear plans to 
a certain extent, any kind of pressure or intimidation by 
America can end in disaster. Such a warning is a reply to 
developments that may take place during the agreement or 
afterward. This comes at a time when Sam Nunn, the chairman of 
the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, announced during a 
recent television interview that if North Korea insists on 
keeping its nuclear weapons America will put North Korea in such 
political and military isolation that after a time all its 
economy and regime will collapse. Such an announcement, even as 
a mere threat, shows how the existence of a socialist country 
with an anti-American nature cannot be easily tolerated by 
Washington. 
  In any case, the insistence of the two sides on keeping 
their 
positions has so far prevented the achievement of a final 
solution to the existing differences, and as long as America 
does not respond positively to requests made by North Korea, it 
seems unlikely that an agreement can be easily reached, 
particularly as during the nine months of crisis in the 
relations between America and North Korea relations, Pyongyang 
has shown the necessary flexibility.

had destroyed and set afire numerous residential units in the 
marshes including 150 houses in al-Basrah. Another refugee,

forces had moved inhabitants of the villages to unknown places 
after demolishing their houses. 
  He noted that the Iraqi Army tortured the marshlanders and

  [Text] With the participation of the God-seeking masses, 
devoted to the pure rites of Muhammad, may peace be upon him and 
his scion, the Friday prayers were staged today throughout the 
country. 
  Ayatollah [hmad Jannati led the Friday prayers in Tehran, 
and 
expressed his condolences on the anniversary of the demise of 
Her Holiness Zaynab [daughter of first Shiite imam], may peace 
be upon her. He then set out to describe highlights of her 
fruitful life and her services as the disseminator of the 
liberating message of the uprising by Imam Husayn. 
  In his second sermon, the acting Friday prayer leader of 
Tehran referred to the start of the new Christian year, and 
criticized the Vatican for its recognition of the Zionist 
regime. He expressed hope that world powers and organizations 
which consider themselves Christians will review their past 
behavior and refrain from displaying a coercive and criminal 
attitude toward innocent people. 
  Tehran's Friday prayer preacher then described the saddening 
living conditions of the Muslim people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in 
particular during the winter, and paid tribute to their 
continued resistance to attacks by the aggressors. He called 
for more help from the Islamic world for the Muslim people of 
Bosnia. 
  Ayatollah Jannati then alluded to parts of the remarks 
graciously made by the eminent leader [Khamene'i] in his meeting 
with the members of the Assembly of Experts [on 29 December]. 
He said: In view of the spiritual and divine status of the 
position of leadership in society, who like divine prophets 
shoulder the responsibility of guiding the people toward Islamic 
values and of safeguarding the general interests of Islamic 
societies, the people must fully obey the eminent leader with 
utmost love and sincerity. In this way the might of Islam and 
the Muslims may be enhanced even further, especially in the face 
of conspiracies hatched by the enemies. 
  He then referred to Grand Ayatollah Araki and expressed 
satisfaction at the concentration of marja'iyat [status of being 
a source of emulation] in him. 
  In another part of his second sermon, the acting Tehran 
Friday prayers leader tribute to the personality of Mr. Hashemi- 
Rafsanjani and his valuable services, and considered him as a 
unique personality. He then asked the Almighty to grant 
ever-increasing success to our country's president. 
  Furthermore, Tehran's Friday prayer preacher enumerated the 
government's infrastructural policies aimed at reforming the 
country's economic structure. He stressed the need to pay 
tribute to all the steps taken by the government, and at the 
same time to speak out about existing problems in a sincere 
manner and suggest solutions for them. Ayatollah Jannati also 
referred to the emphasis placed by the eminent leader on the 
need to reduce consumption and increase production so as to 
improve the country's economic conditions. Following on this, 
he called on the people and the officials to refrain from waste 
and to have consideration for the the low-income groups. He 
also considered that firm but just confrontation of offenders is 
a factor capable of strengthening the Islamic system of our 
country. 
  In conclusion Ayatollah Jannati praised the country's 
officials for their efforts to stage events for Book Week. He 
said: The spread of the culture of book reading will bring 
growth and progress to the society.

  [Editorial Report] Tehran IRIB Television Second Program 
Network in Persian begins broadcasting Friday prayers in Qom at 
1529 GMT on 31 December, led by Ayatollah Amini, lecturer at the 
theological school and a senior member of the Assembly of 
Experts. 
  In his first sermon, Amini speaks on the various aspects of 
Shi'ite leadership and the source of emulation, including the 
meaning of religious judgment, the need for religious leaders, 
and conditions for the post. 
  He says that there are hundreds of capable individuals at 
theological schools who could be sources of emulation, but have 
failed to do so because they are more interested in teaching. 
He calls on them to formulate religious laws in all fields, 
particularly social affairs. 
  Amini says he supports the recent statement by Qom's 
theological scholars approving Ayatollah Araki's position as the 
source of emulation after the death of Ayatollah Golpayegani. 
  In his second sermon, which begins at at 1556 GMT, he speaks 
on the spiritual and social life of first Shi'ite Imam Ali. 
  The second sermon ends at 1610 GMT.

  [Text] Tehran, Dec. 30, IRNA -- Prominent Ayatollah 
'Abdolkarim Musavi-Ardebili has been hospitalized in Tehran 
after suffering a stroke. The 70-year-old ayatollah was first 
taken to the late Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani Hospital in the 
holy city of Qom after complaining of chest pain and headache 
during a visit to Mofid University in the city Tuesday night. 
Mas'ud Musavi, the son of the former chief justice, said that 
his father's left arm and leg have been paralyzed as a result of 
apoplexy. 
  The doctors treating Ayatollah Ardebili at Tehran's Khatem 
ol- Anbia hospital, where the ayatollah was later taken, said 
they expect the ayatollah to fully recover in a week. 
  Talking to reporters, Ayatollah Musavi-Ardebili said he was

member of the Revolutionary Council, prosecutor general, head of 
the High Judicial Council and chief justice.

  [Text] Pakistan and India meet in Islamabad on Sunday in a 
bid to resolve the Kashmir issue. The foreign secretaries of 
the two countries will have two days of parleys to negotiate 
comprehensively on all aspects of Jammu and Kashmir issue, 
besides other bilateral matters. The Indian foreign secretary 
is reaching Islamabad tomorrow. Pakistan Television diplomatic 
correspondent says this is for the first time that India has 
explicitly agreed to place the Kashmir issue on the agenda of 
talks. Pakistan on its part has always been raising the Kashmir 
issue during previous high-level talks between the two 
countries, while India always tried to avoid the question. 
  In Islamabad, a Foreign Office spokesman has said the 
forthcoming talks with India will be the final round of formal 
dialogue between the two countries if New Delhi shows no 
flexibility on the Kashmir dispute. He told reporters yesterday 
that there will be no more formal talks on bilateral relations 
if the Indians fail to come with concrete proposals on Kashmir. 
Pakistan, the spokesman said, is willing to discuss nuclear and 
other issues with India only if it shows serious interest in 
resolving the dispute over the occupied valley. Kashmir, he 
added, is the flash point and there can be no peace in the 
region if it is not resolved. While agreeing on the forthcoming 
talks, Pakistan had asked India to end the siege of Hazratbal 
Shrine and stop human rights violations in occupied Kashmir to 
make the secretaries-level talks meaningful. Our correspondent 
says though the siege of Hazratbal Shrine was lifted on the 16th 
of last month, the flagrant human right violations have been 
continuing unabated. 
  Foreign Office sources say Pakistan wishes to reiterate that 
continuing escalation of repression by the Indian troops and 
paramilitary forces in Jammu and Kashmir is a source of most 
serious concern and anguish for the people and the government of 
Pakistan. During the talks, the sources said, the Pakistani side 
would urge India to concede to the wishes of the people of 
Kashmir and grant them their inalienable right of 
self-determination -- a promise it had made but denied to them 
since 1947. 
  The Foreign Office spokesman said Pakistan will find it 
extremely difficult to continue this sterile process of dialogue 
if India fails to respond to the aspirations of the people of 
Kashmir. If there is no progress, Pakistan would take the 
matter before the international community and tell the world to 
resolve the explosive situation, the spokesman added. 
  In the light of the secretary-level talks between Pakistan 
and India on Kashmir, the members of the Kashmir Committee of 
the National Assembly and prominent Kashmiri leaders were 
briefed about the government's position. Foreign Minister 
Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told the committee members that Pakistan's 
stand on Kashmir had always been clear. It supports Kashmiris' 
right to self-determination and their ongoing struggle for this 
inalienable right. Pakistan wants the implementation of the UN 
resolutions on Kashmir because it understands that peace in the 
region will remain elusive unless this dispute is resolved. The 
chairman of the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee, Nawabzada 
Nasrullah Khan; the president and prime minister of AJK [Azad 
Jammu and Kashmir]; president of the People's Party of AJK; 
President of Muslim League of AJK; President of Liberation 
League of AJK; and acting president of the Jammu and Kashmir 
Liberation Front attended the briefing. 
  President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has described the 
Pakistan-India foreign secretary-level talks scheduled on Sunday 
in Islamabad as a step to find out a political and amicable 
solution to the decades-long Kashmir issue. Talking to newsmen 
in Akora Khattak, the president said this is a political forum 
available to us and we want to use it. Pakistan wants that the 
Kashmiris should be given their birthright of self-determination 
in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the United 
Nations. Pakistan has always condemned Indian brutalities 
against the innocent Kashmiris and it would continue to extend 
moral and political support to them. President Leghari regretted 
that Indian atrocities have reached their peak and there is no 
precedence of such brutalities in the entire history of mankind. 
He said the strength of the Indian forces has crossed the 
figure of 500,000 in occupied Kashmir. The president said the 
world pressure on India for a peaceful solution of the Kashmir 
issue is also building up.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali has put 
forward certain conditions for the continuance of the 
India-Pakistan dialogue on Kashmir, because India has weakened 
the atmosphere in spite of the formal understanding between the 
two countries to improve the situation in occupied Kashmir. He 
said Pakistan considers fulfillment of some of the conditions to 
be imperative -- the reduction in the forces in occupied 
Kashmir, the release of Kashmiri leaders, and an end to brutal 
repression -- for the continuation of the dialogue. The foreign 
minister stated this at a news conference in Islamabad 
yesterday, during which he commented on the upcoming 
India-Pakistan foreign secretary-level talks on the Kashmir 
issue beginning in Islamabad on 2 January. He said that 
massacre, molestation of women, and the burning of villages all 
continue in occupied Kashmir with no abatement of Indian 
brutalities there. 
  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said that during the next round of 
negotiations, comprehensive and detailed discussions will be 
held on the Kashmir issue and Pakistan will approach the talks 
with the utmost sincerity in spite of the grave situation 
prevailing in the occupied valley, because Islamabad believes in 
the negotiated settlement of this problem. He reiterated 
Pakistan's commitment to hold talks on all aspects of the 
Kashmir question and said, unlike New Delhi, Islamabad will 
fulfill its commitment. India had a long time to improve the 
situation in occupied Kashmir, and if New Delhi does not take 
steps to improve the situation in the valley, there is no use 
holding negotiations on the issue. 
  The foreign minister clarified that Pakistan has not asked 
China to play the role of intermediary between India and 
Pakistan. He added that China has expressed profound grief and 
concern at the atrocities and violation of human rights 
committed by Indian forces in occupied Kashmir. China, he said, 
has welcomed the upcoming foreign secretary-level talks between 
India and Pakistan.

  [Text] The two-day secretary-level talks between Pakistan 
and India begin in Islamabad tomorrow. The Kashmir issue will 
be an independent item on the agenda of the talks which will be 
spread over four sessions as India has agreed to discuss all 
aspects of the problem. 
  Authorities in Islamabad are not optimistic about the 
outcome 
of the talks, for India has not so far stopped repression 
against the people of Kashmir in the occupied territory. 
Pakistan had asked India to end human right violations in 
occupied Kashmir immediately and to reduce its troops in the 
valley, leading to a total withdrawal, in order to create a 
conducive atmosphere for holding the talks. 
  The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, has said with 
all the killings going on in occupied Kashmir, with women being 
raped, with villages being set on fire, and with the repression 
going on, how can one feel optimism. He said this is the last 
opportunity for New Delhi to prove that it is sincere in solving 
the Kashmir issue through negotiations. If India, he added, 
fails to take even the minimum steps, then it is its last chance 
for the talks. Pakistan would not hold any further talks and 
instead take up the issue at international forums and inform its 
friends that New Delhi is not sincere in solving the issue. 
Pakistan, the foreign minister said, is taking part in the 
talks so that India could not say that Pakistan is avoiding a 
negotiated settlement of the issue. We believe negotiations are 
the most civilized manner to settle disputes. 
  Commenting on the claim of the Indian foreign minister that 
Kashmir is an integral part of India, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said 
on the one hand India had accepted Kashmir as a disputed 
territory and agreed to hold talks on the issue as a separate 
agenda, while, on the other hand, it is claiming that Kashmir is 
its integral part. One can judge the sincerity of the Indians in 
holding these talks and solving the problem, Sardar Asif Ahmad 
Ali said.

  [Text] The seventh round of secretary-level talks between 
Pakistan and India on the Kashmir issue begins in Islamabad 
today. At the talks, the Pakistani delegation will be led by the 
foreign secretary, Dr. Shaharyar M. Khan. The Indian side will 
be led by its foreign secretary, J.N. Dixit. The Indian foreign 
secretary arrived in Islamabad last night with a four-member 
delegation to participate in the talks. 
  Speaking to newsmen at the airport, Mr. Dixit said Kashmir 
is 
an outstanding issue between Pakistan and India and both sides 
will seriously discuss it in view of its significance. Replying 
to queries of newsmen, he said there might be differences in the 
perceptions of the two countries. They, however, will make 
efforts to understand each other's points of view and to narrow 
down differences on the Kashmir issue. Asked whether there will 
be a discussion on the issue of holding a plebiscite in Kashmir, 
Dixit said both sides can raise questions according to their 
stand on the issue. When he was asked whether both sides will 
exchange views on resolving the Kashmir issue along the lines of 
autonomy granted to the Palestinians in the Gaza territory, the 
Indian foreign secretary said it depends upon the nations 
concerned. If they learn lessons and experiences from history, 
it will be better for them. Mr. Dixit refused to say whether he 
has brought a new proposal for the seventh round of talks. He 
said there is no program to involve Kashmiri representatives at 
the current round of talks. 
  Foreign Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan, who will lead the 
Pakistani delegation, said Pakistan is glad that India agreed to 
hold talks on all aspects of the Kashmir issue. He said both 
sides will consider the issue with seriousness. He expressed 
the hope that there would be progress at the talks between the 
two sides. 
  Radio Pakistan's diplomatic representative says Pakistan and 
India expressed their readiness to resume secretary-level talks 
to discuss all outstanding issues, including all aspects of the 
Kashmir issue, last November. The previous round of talks was 
held in New Delhi in August 1992. Pakistan is expected to urge 
India to honor the aspirations of the Kashmiri people and pave 
the way for a plebiscite in the area to find out their opinion 
in accordance with the UN Security Council. 
  It is expected that Dixit will also call on President Farooq 
Ahmad Khan Leghari and Foreign Minister Asif Ahmad Ali.

  [Text] The secretary-level talks between Pakistan and India 
began in Islamabad today. Foreign Secretary Mr. Shaharyar Khan 
is leading the Pakistani side, while the Indian delegation is 
headed by the external affairs secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit. 
Quoting Foreign Office sources, Pakistan Television diplomatic 
correspondent says during the four rounds of talks, the 
Pakistani side would endeavor to focus attention on all aspects 
of the Kashmir dispute as already agreed to by New Delhi in 
order to find out a negotiated and peaceful settlement of the 
problem. Our correspondent says Pakistan has been calling upon 
India to stop repression and atrocities in the occupied 
territory and make visible improvement on the ground in the 
valley in order to ensure continuation of dialogue in a positive 
direction. Other issues relating to bilateral matters may also 
be taken up during the talks. Additional foreign secretary, Mr. 
Munir Akram, who is taking part in the talks, spoke to Pakistan

  [Begin Akram recording] So far the talks have started on a 
note of seriousness and both the president and the foreign

the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir on the basis of the 
resolutions of the United Nations. The talks have so far 
focused on Kashmir, and we have had a first round of reiteration

  [Text] Pakistan has made it clear to India that no further 
talks will be possible unless situation in occupied Kashmir is 
improved and human right violations are stopped. This was 
stated by Foreign Secretary Mr. Shaharyar M. Khan while talking 
to newsmen at Islamabad Airport after the departure of the 
Indian foreign secretary. 
  [Begin Khan recording] We shall not schedule any talks, 
either at the foreign secretary level or at any other level, 
until there is a visible improvement of the situation in 
Indian-held Kashmir. 
  Pakistan maintained its principled position that a solution 
to the Kashmir issue lay in a plebiscite on the basis of UN 
resolutions. 
  For Pakistan, the people of Kashmir are the central players, 
because it is they who must determine their future. 
  We believe that everyone concerned -- the Security Council, 
India, Pakistan, we have all agreed to a method, a format for 
ascertaining the wishes of the Kashmiri people and that is in a 
plebiscite. [end recording] 
  Earlier, addressing a joint press conference at the airport 
before his departure, the Indian foreign secretary said we have 
met after such a long time and have addressed the specific 
question of Jammu and Kashmir. 
  Mr. Shaharyar M. Khan said that it was the first time that 
both sides agreed to discuss the question of Kashmir 
meaningfully and purposefully. Both the foreign secretaries 
agreed that the Kashmiris are central to the problem and they 
would be taken into confidence for the resolution of the Kashmir 
problem. 
  In a joint statement issued in Islamabad today at the end of 
the two-day talks, Pakistan and India reiterated the need to 
engage in a meaningful dialogue with a view of addressing all 
the outstanding problems, including Jammu and Kashmir. The 
statement said the talks addressed all aspects of Jammu and 
Kashmir problem, and both sides recognized that there are basic 
divergences. It was agreed that sincere efforts would be made 
to resolve the problem. The statement said the two sides will 
consult each other on the question of further talks at the 
foreign secretary level or any other level. 
  At the conclusion of the third round of talks between 
Pakistan and India, the Indian delegation led by the foreign 
secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, called on the foreign minister, 
Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, at the Foreign Office. Other members of 
the Indian delegation also attended the meeting. Foreign 
Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan and other members of the Pakistan 
delegation were also present during the meeting.

  [Text] The Senate today unanimously adopted a resolution 
demanding an end to repressive measures by the Indian forces and 
withdrawal of troops to pave the way for implementation of the 
UN resolutions to hold plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir. On a 
motion moved under Rule 194 by Professor Khurshid Ahmad and the 
leader of the opposition, Mr. Mohammad Ali Khan, the house 
adopted a substantive resolution on Indo-Pakistan negotiations 
on Kashmir. The resolution expressed deep concern over the 
repressive measures by the Indian occupation forces against the 
Kashmiris struggling for liberation of occupied territory and 
atrocities let loose against the innocent people. The 
resolution also demanded release of political leadership of the 
Kashmir liberation movement and bringing an end to violations of 
human rights and repression against the people of Jammu and 
Kashmir. 
  The resolution called upon the government to hold 
negotiations for a final solution of the Kashmir dispute in 
accordance with the UN resolutions and commitment of the 
government of India and that of Pakistan. The resolution 
further said that unless the Kashmir dispute, which is the main 
issue between India and Pakistan, is decided, negotiations on 
other issues, like normalization of relations, economic 
cooperation, Siachen, and Wular Barrage, would be tantamount to 
sidetracking the real issue. Those who participated in the 
debate on the motion besides the movers are: Federal Minister 
for Special Education Dr. Sher Afghan, Raja Mohammad Zafarul 
Haq, Manzoor Ahmad Gichki, Hafiz Hussain Ahmad, Syed Mohammad 
Fazal Agha, Syed Fasih Iqbal, retired Justice Zakiuddin Pal, and 
the leader of the house, Malik Mohammad Qasim. 
  The Senate also decided to constitute a special committee on 
Kashmir. The house took the decision on a motion by the 
minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, Syed Iqbal 
Haider. The chairman of the Senate will decide about the 
composition of the committee. The committee will monitor 
violations of human rights and atrocities being committed by the 
Indian forces in the occupied Kashmir to mobilize world opinion 
in support of the cause of the Kashmiris as well as stand of the 
government of Pakistan. The house will now meet on Sunday 
afternoon.

  [Text] Rawalpindi, Dec 31 -- Amanullah Khan, the chief of 
Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) has called upon the 
Governments of India and Pakistan to quit Kashmir and hand it 
over to the United Nations. 
  The Kashmir leader rejected the talks between the Foreign 
Secretaries of Pakistan and India which are starting in 
Islamabad Sunday. 
  He was addressing a public rally on Friday soon after his 
arrival here from Brussels via Karachi. 
  Amanullah was arrested in Belgium on Oct 18 while he was 
undertaking an extensive tour of Europe at the invitation of the 
Socialist Group of the European Parliament. 
  Although India tried its level best to get him extradited to 
India, the pressure from Pakistan and several European quarters 
frustrated the Indian move. He remained in a Belgium jail for 
72 days. 
  He said the Kashmiris would not accept any agreement reached 
between Pakistan and India without the participation of the 
Kashmiris. "How can these two countries decide the fate of over 
12 million Kashmiris?" he asked. 
  The two countries, Amanullah claimed, "are not serious in 
holding the dialogue because such a dialogue, if at all it is 
necessary to be held, should have taken place at the level of 
the Prime Ministers." "The Foreign Secretaries are no better 
than clerks," he said, adding, "What they decide would carry no 
weight for the Kashmiris." [punctuations as published] 
  Reiterating the JKLF position on Kashmir, he called upon 
India and Pakistan to vacate the Valley and hand it over to the 
United Nations. 
  Elaborating further, he said the UN administration should 
not 
include any representation from the US. The mandate of the UN 
administration should be to hold plebiscite in Kashmir after 
five years, he added. 
  Describing his release by the Belgian authorities a victory 
for the Kashmiris' struggle, he argued the Kashmiris have now 
also won on the legal front. "The fact," he said, "that I have 
been released by a neutral court indicates that the Kashmiris' 
stand is just." 
  The JKLF chief said although he was given on opportunity to 
use his right to bail by the Belgian authorities, he refused to 
avail himself of the facility because he was a political 
prisoner. He said his release was a victory for the oppressed 
and the freedom fighters of Kashmir. 
  Earlier Amanullah Khan was warmly received by hundreds of 
his 
party workers at the airport when he arrived here from Karachi. 
He was brought to the city in a big procession. The 
processionists kept raising slogans in favour of independence 
for Kashmir.

  [Text] There has been reports of a series of bomb blasts 
in Doda, Bhadarwah, and Kishtwar areas of Jammu region in 
occupied Kashmir. Commenting on the explosions, a Foreign 
Office spokesman said this is a manifestation of the alienation 
of the people of Kashmir with Indian rule and their response to 
brutal repression by occupation troops. The situation in Jammu 
region is reported tense following the bomb blasts at various 
places. Indian troops have shot dead another five people during 
siege and search operations in Ganderbal, Khaniyar, Badgam, and 
(Laulab) areas. A number of people were also rounded up during 
the operations. Mojahedin in retaliation have attacked bunkers 
and other military targets in nine localities of Srinagar. 
Several troops were injured when Mojahedin launched a surprise 
attack on an Indian army contingent near Kulgam area. Two 
bridges of military importance were also destroyed by Mojahedin 
in Jammu region.

  [Text] Pakistan has appealed to Afghan leaders to end their 
conflict and hold political negotiations to resolve their 
differences. A Foreign Office spokesman expressed deep concern 
over the escalation of fighting between rival factions in Kabul 
and Mazar-e Sharif. The spokesman said the use of force is not 
the right method to resolve political differences and disputes. 
The military success of one faction over another will only be 
temporary and it can widen the area of confrontation, thereby 
affecting national unity. He said the Afghan leaders should 
resume the process of reconciliation in order to meet the need 
of the hour. He said the Islamabad and Jalalabad accords 
reached between mojahedin organizations last year were based on 
national consensus and they provide the base for a durable 
political settlement that can restore peace in Afghanistan.

  [Text] After his arrival in Amman today en route to Tunis 
where he will hold talks with the Palestinian leadership, Dr. 
Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, head of the Palestinian delegation to the 
peace talks, stressed the importance of Arab coordination under 
the current circumstances. During his meetings in Tunis, he 
said, discussions will be held on the memorandum which some 
Palestinian personalities submitted to the Palestinian 
leadership on recent developments in the Palestinian arena. 
  [Begin recording] ['Abd-al-Shafi, in progress] ... the 
memorandum. President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] asked for a 
meeting with representatives of those who signed this memorandum 
to discuss it with them. 
  [Jordan Television correspondent Salim 'Ali Dhiyab] What are 
the outlines of this memorandum? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] In fact, the memorandum is concerned with 
the situation which resulted from the Declaration of Principles. 
This situation poses serious threats to the Palestinians. This 
requires several things. It requires good readiness and 
preparation for the negotiations that will be held to interpret 
and implement the agreement and also for decisionmaking. In 
this context, we want to expand the basis of decisionmaking. 
  [Dhiyab] Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, you were one of those who 
advocated Jordanian-Palestinian-Arab coordination. Are you now 
satisfied with the level of current coordination? 
  ['Abd-al-Shafi] The principle of coordination was approved 
by everyone. All parties acknowledge that Middle East peace is 
an indivisible issue, and that there should be a unified Arab 
position. These are agreed issues. The foreign ministers' 
meetings which preceded each round of negotiations were held out 
of [Arab] coordination. It is true that the declaration of 
principles was reached away from the Arab brothers, which 
actually violated the principle of coordination. However, I 
hope that matters will proceed in the direction of coordination. 
This is an extremely important matter. [end recording]

three-day working visit to Jordan. During the visit, Dr. 
'Abd-al-Shafi met with Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali and a number of Palestinian figures in Jordan. 
  In a statement before his departure for Tunis, Dr. 
'Abd-al-Shafi said that he will meet with Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat to discuss the memorandum that was presented to 
him by Palestinian figures two weeks ago. This memorandum calls 
for expanding the base of decisionmaking within the PLO. 
  He stressed the importance of reactivating 
Jordanian-Palestinian coordination within the framework of Arab 
coordination. This is especially so since the peace 
negotiations are facing a crisis that requires pooling Arab 
efforts to overcome it in a way that guarantees Arab rights and 
interests. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi is accompanied by a delegation that 
includes a number of Palestinian figures who signed the 
memorandum.

  [Begin Habash recording] Naturally, the Palestinian issue, 
in particular, is a basic issue. It was very important to me to 
explain the PFLP's stand on the entire course of the settlement. 
In fact, I felt that I benefited very much from the prime 
minister's views during this meeting because I listened to the 
official Jordanian viewpoint on the course of the settlement. I 
actually expressed much concern about the continuation of 
positive relations between the PFLP and Jordan on the basis that 
whatever the differences, the basic focus should be on the need 
to achieve the Palestinian national program -- the program 
toward achieving repatriation and self-determination and 
establishing the Palestinian state. I confidently felt that 
Jordan's regime, under the leadership of his majesty the king, 
will continue to be of great support to our cause. [end

<F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn at a meeting of "high-ranking </F>
Jordanian Army officers" in Amman on 1 January--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We never gave up faith that we 
are part of one big Arab family. Jordan continued on the course 
of the great Arab revolt in defending Palestine, the right of 
its people to their land, and the right of the Arabs and Muslims 
in Palestine and in all the big homeland. 
  In 1948, when they decided to enter Palestine militarily, in 
spite of all the perils and risks, this country had the honor to 
move and offer something. This Army, in particular, had had the 
honor of saving the major part of Palestine, and Jerusalem. We 
will remember the martyrs as long as we live, and generations to 
come will also remember them, not to mention the jihad, the 
sincerity, the courage, and the wisdom of the leadership which 
enabled much to be attained. Had it not been for this fact of 
saving the West Bank, there would not have been an opportunity 
now to discuss how to regain a specific part of the land either 
by us or by anyone else. No one should forget this fact. We do 
not say this to have others express gratitude that we have done 
this and performed this. This is a duty, an honor, and a 
commitment. We say this just to state a fact which we should 
not forget because many of us in this part of the world had 
forgotten many facts from which one could have benefited because 
they constitute features of what deserves to be adopted or from 
which advice and lessons could be learned. [passage omitted] 
  The talk now is about the Jordanian-Palestinian 
relationship. 
This relationship is solid, deep, and unique. I frankly say 
that perhaps we wronged ourselves for many years by agreeing to 
be an object of attacks, insults, accusations, and the forging 
of facts. We tolerated these things and we did not deal with 
them as we should have done. This method, in itself, led to 
atmospheres fraught with skepticism and doubts, as if in 1948, 
1949 and in all the years that followed and from the beginning, 
Jordan and its leadership have had an objective other than the 
noble objective of honorably defending this nation and 
protecting its right, and that Jordan sought to obtain 
something, or aspired to impose its control. Within this 
framework, all the Arab, Palestinian, and hostile forces 
intentionally or unintentionally contributed to sowing doubts 
and to negatively affecting the picture. However, had we not 
taken the stand we took in 1967 -- and we were aware of what the 
result would be -- there would have been an opportunity for an 
explosion in this country from within, and Israel would have 
occupied this country, not only the West Bank, but our entire 
territory as well [passage omitted] 
  Going back to 1967 and the long years and suffering. A 
sisterly Arab country was ahead of us in signing a peace treaty 
with Israel. The situation then developed into an agreement 
between the Palestinian leadership, which represents the 
Palestinian Arab people, and the Israeli side. This leadership 
is the party that has the power, and our role is a supportive 
one in this case regardless of all other considerations. 
  The agenda which deals with our issues was signed, and 
efforts began to discuss its various clauses, which are 
headlines for all issues important to us. This does not 
adversely affect the Palestinian rights on their national soil 
as far as we are concerned. 
  This is the situation. In addition to this, there is 
coordination with our brothers within the framework of our 
utmost capabilities. I believe that the brothers in Syria are 
also on their way to discussing the dimensions dealing with 
Syria, and the same is the case with Lebanon. We are in contact 
with them. We make our own decisions, and we fulfill our 
obligations toward ourselves, but frankly we believe that there 
are thorny issues that need time before they are resolved, 
because this country has endured more than any other country 
since the beginning, and on all levels. All attempts and all 
pressures we suffered during the past period... [pauses] All 
quarters have been asking us to conclude a peace treaty. The 
answer to all of this was that the peace treaty comes at the 
end, when all presented issues are resolved in a satisfactory 
manner to us, of course, and to the concerned parties. 
  Peace is not a document that we sign, then we start to 
negotiate. No, we should discuss everything, and when we reach 
an acceptable and reasonable result, and when we think that our 
brothers at that time will be in a similar position or ahead of 
us, then the comprehensive peace will be realized. This peace 
is what we have been calling for since the very beginning. This 
is our march and this what we are trying to do. 
  Our preparations are complete, praise be to God, and we 
concentrate on three main issues. The issue of land; we have an 
occupied land that was occupied in the south shortly after 1967. 
The area of this occupied land is not small, and we insist that 
it should fully return to Jordanian sovereignty. 
  There is also the subject of water. You hear much about 
peace as something that we can consider or leave. We should be 
aware of the fact and the reality. All reports and studies 
indicate that in the year 2010 there will not be enough drinking 
water for the people in Jordan. Practically, we consume less 
water than others do. This water is consumed by the people, not 
by agriculture, industry, or any other sector. This is a 
serious problem that is also facing others. If we consider only 
this dimension, it will be a great duty to discuss the future of 
the next generations and how they are going to live. 
  At least, we have to do whatever we can to ease our 
consciences in the hope that we will achieve a just, 
comprehensive, and full peace that would restore rights to their 
rightful owners and give us the chance to have a rest even for 
once in preparation for a new phase, given that a state of just, 
comprehensive, and full peace would provide people with life 
opportunities that are completely different from those we have 
seen in terms of educational opportunities, peace of mind, 
future stability, security and work. 
  We face constant siege and pressure. We will not accept 
anything that we do not believe to be right and just. Our heads 
will never bow to anyone other than Almighty God. But on the 
other hand, we want just and comprehensive peace. We want a 
life for your sons and for those who will come afterward. 
  Israel is a small spot in a large ocean. If the desired 
peace is established the way it should, with the passage of 
time, the problem as it is at present will be resolved and done 
away with. If there are other means that could help ensure 
stability and guarantee the survival of future generations, I am 
personally unaware of such means. 
  With regard to Jordanian-Palestinian relations, I have, as a 
matter of course, noted, among other things, three issues. 
These are territory, water resources, and the human individual 
in terms of the modalities of moving from our current status to 
the status that should prevail, the opportunities that must be 
made available to him, the kind of life he must enjoy, 
stability, the opportunities that would enable him to fulfill 
himself and achieve all that is possible at present and in the 
future so he may make up for lost opportunities, and so he may 
become strong and capable of coping with life and its future 
challenges. Last, but not least, there is the issue of 
Jerusalem. Jerusalem will remain in our hearts, consciences, 
minds, and chests. It will continue to shape our entire lives. 
This has been the case in the past since the inception of the 
Great Arab Revolt and continued until the establishment of this 
kingdom on this spot of earth and thereafter--throughout all 
stages, be they sweet or bitter, that is, in 1948, 1967, and to 
date. This will remain the case until doomsday. For in no way 
whatsoever shall we abandon our responsibilities toward 
Jerusalem. There are many sides which have their own formulas 
and views regarding the issue of Jerusalem. But, given the fact 
that the overall agreement reached between the Palestinians and 
Israelis was grounded in Security Council Resolution 242, then 
this agreement covers Jerusalem. If the [Palestinian] brothers 
were to succeed in their endeavors in the near future, Jerusalem 
might, God willing, become the symbol of Palestinian-Israeli 
reconciliation and peace. 
  As regards holy shrines in Jerusalem and our 
responsibilities 
toward them, we will do our best to safeguard and protect these 
holy shrines. It is our firm belief...[pauses] We have lately 
called for the restoration of Islamic sovereignty over Islamic 
holy shrines in Jerusalem. This could be achieved through the 
creation of a nonpolitical body that might bring together the 
Islamic world and the splintered Islamic nation. It is hoped 
that such a proposal would enable this nation to play its role 
and perform its duty toward Jerusalem. If this were to be 
achieved, we would immensely assist such an endeavor to perform 
our duty in this regard. 
  As a matter of course, we call for the continuation of 
inter-faith dialogue. We also believe that no single country 
should exercise sovereignty over the holy shrines of the 
children of Abraham, may God's peace be upon him. For no 
sovereignty except that of God should be exercised over these 
holy shrines. God might have willed that this city, which 
houses shrines that move the hearts of faithful people, lead a 
kind of life that is unprecedented throughout its long history. 
This would materialize someday if all faithful people were to 
choose to humble themselves before the Almighty God, to worship 
Him, and to respect one another within the context of just and 
honorable peace. We do not recognize the sovereignty of any 
party over Jerusalem and Islamic holy shrines there except that 
of the Almighty God. 
  This is what we are attempting to promote on the universal, 
religious, Arab, and Islamic levels. We beseech God to make 
Jerusalem a meeting point for all Arabs and Muslims, just as 
Palestine should have been. We have been making enormous 
efforts to safeguard the future, and will continue to do so. 
This is the overall picture. I hope that I have managed to 
explain it to you, or to address some of its main features as 
they have unfolded during the recent past. 
  On the Jordanian-Palestinian level, we held a meeting 48 
hours ago. I personally regard that meeting as a decisive one. 
Both the climate and the responsibility require complete 
frankness. In that meeting, we were extremely frank, gave 
advice, and defined the fact that we are committed to what we 
agree on, and that we cannot tell our people that there is 
coordination unless there is an actual coordination. We cannot 
tell our people that there is agreement unless there is an 
actual agreement. We were promised that on Tuesday [4 January], 
to be exact, the brothers will come here in order to address the 
required priorities with all possible speed and with the needed 
perfection and clarity. 
  For our part, we said that this would be the last 
opportunity. Otherwise, and henceforth, each side would 
separately assume its responsibilities. We made attempts and 
tolerated too much and we cannot proceed in this way. We would 
then frankly brief the people on all details. We will extend 
backing and support within the confines of our capabilities and 
resources, provided that the path has clear features. 
Commitment should mean commitment. We should not remain in a 
whirlpool of talks that do not yield tangible results. I ask 
God that the brothers would be at the required level. It goes 
without saying that recently I offered advice and tried to say 
that the situation has changed, that this leadership now must be 
a leadership for all the Palestinians in the inside and outside. 
The Palestinians must feel that they are part of the march at 
this criticial stage. Those who are capable of assuming 
responsibility should be prepared to do so. They must be given 
the chance to work in all fields. The question of credibility 
is very important. We agreed and disagreed tens of times. 
Then, we found that there are interpretations of what had been 
agreed. We disagree on these interpretations. However, the 
picture now is different. The situation is critical and calls 
for another method. We ask God to help our brothers adopt this 
method. We will extend support within the confines of our 
capabilities and resources. 
  The issue of the bridges, about which you have heard 
perhaps, 
was also a point concerning which we blamed the brothers, too; 
the reports that we heard, namely, that they say that Jordan 
wishes Israeli control to remain on the crossings and bridges? 
We are not a party. We told the brothers that we are a state 
and they are now on the way to establishing their own state. We 
are on the bridges. We, who are sharing the pain and suffering 
of our people in the occupied territories, find it impossible to 
prefer--if this is possible--any presence on these bridges on 
the Palestinian side except the Palestinians. This climate and 
this venom is there. 
  In my talks [with 'Arafat] about the confederation, I asked 
the brother president to drop this expression from his lexicon 
and absolutely not to discuss it with me, not in any form--not 
even any other formula, other type, or other approach that leads 
to this course. 
  Brothers, let us be frank. Our enemies worked against us. 
Ignorant elements and many sides worked against us, harmed this 
real and unique relationship between relatives and brothers who 
lived together, and suffered together. Speaking about formulas 
for the future, we are now tackling differences which exist 
among our brothers and relatives in the Arab homeland within the 
framework of the latest formuals that they had agreed. We want 
to start from the base and reach the top. We need time to 
dispel these doubts and illusions. The Palestinians and 
Jordanians must know that they are brothers. If the problems 
stem from the highest echelons, let us start from a sound basis 
and let us fully offer our support and backing within the 
confines of our capabilities. Let us work and at the 
appropriate time and circumstances, people will decide the 
nature of the relationship which should be established. But, to 
create formulas and act on them, I believe is premature and out 
of place. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani by </F>
unidentified reporter, in Amman on 2 January] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Your Excellency, in his speech yesterday, 
His Majesty King Husayn said that the Palestinian side has 
promised that a Palestinian delegation will arrive in Amman to 
discuss priorities between the two sides in a frank and open 
atmosphere. His Majesty King Husayn said that this will be the 
last opportunity for understanding. How do you explain His 
Majesty King Husayn's remarks in this regard? 
  [Al-'Anani] I believe that His Majesty King Husayn's speech 
is based on a very strong concern, as usual, about making the 
Jordanian-Palestinian coordination on the highest level and very 
clear. This is because everyone is watching this relationship 
and many decisions will be made in accordance with this 
relationship. The other thing is that time is passing quickly 
and that events are changing rapidly. Moreover, there are 
timetables included in the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement. 
These timetables set dates for accomplishing matters. So, out 
of his concern about making this relationship clear and 
proceeding within sound frameworks, especially since any 
agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis affects us and 
the current peace talks affect both of us a great deal, 
coordination is a must. Based on this, postponing this issue or 
making Jordan wait longer than it should, will reflect 
negatively on us and on the Palestinian brothers. Therefore, I 
see in his majesty's remarks a strong concern about the 
importance of this cooperation and the need to put it within a 
set timetable so that it will not continue to be without set 
dates and results. Here lies the importance of His Majesty King 
Husayn's remarks. 
  [Reporter] What can we discern about Jordan's negotiating 
strategy from His Majesty King Husayn's speech concerning a 
peace treaty? 
  [Al-'Anani] I believe that His Majesty King Husayn has a 
great deal of experience regarding the Arab-Israeli 
relationship. He has continuously proven that he is farsighted 
concerning many issues. His awareness has preceded that of 
others most, if not all, of the time. So, his majesty knows 
full well that the peace talks should not lead to a treaty, 
except at the end. In other words, you must resolve all 
relevant issues. This is what was included in the 
Jordanian-Israeli agenda. First we should discuss water, 
people, land, and many other issues related to the peace process 
such as the refugees and the displaced issue. When all these 
issues are settled and when we become certain that peace will be 
just and comprehensive on all fronts and cover all these issues, 
then the talk about a peace treaty becomes clear. 
  If we declare an intention to sign agreements and going on 
to talk about them, we leave the field open for 
misunderstandings and various interpretations that could hold up 
the entire the peace process. There is a logical sequence that 
his majesty's speech made clear. 
  [Reporter] His majesty spoke about certain fears being 
raised about an Israeli domination under peace? 
  [Al-'Anani] His majesty's speech has made it absolutely 
clear that, as a man of vision, certain pieces of advice he has 
given to his brother Arab leaders, have turned out to be the 
right counsel. Take what happened in the 1967 war when we joined 
a war for which we were caught unprepared and thus passed up the 
opportunity to be better prepared in the future. Again, 
consider the Khartoum no's of the 1969 Arab summit. These 
created an emotionally charged atmosphere in which we could not 
bring our calmer reason to bear in weighing things and making 
the right decisions. The result has been agreements inferior to 
what we may have otherwise obtained. Now, his majesty has drawn 
attention to fears being raised with a view to delaying 
negotiations about peace. His majesty says that the Arab 
world's squandering of or failure to put the assets and 
resources it has at its command to good use may lie at the heart 
of the conflict. His majesty also blames Arab disarray. If we 
close ranks, as his majesty has been urging, and if we marshal 
Arab resources in the peace battle, we will not enable Israel to 
control the Arabs. We know that in the year 2025, there will be 
600 million Arabs. What will Israel be like then? Indeed, 
Israel has more to fear from the peace process. It is agonizing 
over the decision whether or not to make peace. Given its 
assets and resources, however, the Arab world is well positioned 
to counter Israeli or any other hegemony.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Husayn Delineates Milestones Along the Road"] </F>
  [Text] In his recent address to his valiant soldiers, which 
abounds with honesty, candor, and confidence, His Majesty King 
Husayn has reviewed the pan-Arab record of this homeland, which 
has shed chaste blood in defense of Palestine, the territories, 
and holy shrines. In his address, his majesty the king has 
underscored the grave responsibilities Jordan has been 
shouldering with all manliness and honor toward all pan-Arab 
causes, foremost among which is the Palestine question. 
  In this address, His Majesty King Husayn has addressed 
various historical junctures, and explained in detail the 
circumstances surrounding these junctures, as well as the 
historical facts regarding these junctures. He has also spoken 
of the valuable lessons learned from these junctures. We would 
like to dwell upon the last one addressed by the king, namely, 
the ongoing peace process. His majesty the king has explained 
the peace process thoroughly, provided us with an insight into 
its future prospects, and underscored the urgent requirements of 
this phase. 
  The first requirement of this phase in the peace process, 
which was heralded by a joint Jordanian-Palestinian endeavor, 
and indeed, by a single political umbrella, is to promote 
bilateral coordination to the degree that reflects the current 
state of affairs between two fraternal peoples, who share common 
aspirations as well as common national woes, not to mention 
blood relations, history, geography, and joint pan-Arab 
interests. 
  Courtesy over this vital issue is no longer useful. The 
brothers are required to meet as soon as possible to address 
urgent priority issues, and reach a clear agreement that would 
delineate duties and responsibilities in all clarity and 
accuracy. This is necessary if Jordan, this steadfast Arab 
bastion, is to continue to extend its utmost support and 
assistance to the Palestinian brothers in observance of its 
strong national and pan-Arab commitments. 
  We are duty bound to say here that the Jordanian-Palestinian 
coordination lacks the required credibility. It is necessary to 
shun traditional courtesy to proceed together toward a proper 
handling of urgent issues, and explore all possible 
eventualities, particularly since the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles is bound to 
affect, one way or another, Jordan's present and future. 
  Given all this, it is an inescapable duty to put bilateral 
coordination in its proper context, and promote it within a firm 
institutionalized framework that is capable of protecting the 
interests of Jordanians and Palestinians alike and averting any 
crises that could burden the strong and firm 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations at present or in the future in 
any way whatsoever. 
  The Jordanians and Palestinians, who are brothers, have 
lived 
and suffered together. They do not have any doubts about the 
strenuous efforts Husayn has made throughout the past years to 
defend this chaste soil. Likewise, they are aware that the 
Hashemite leadership has made relentless and indefatigable 
efforts to ensure that the rights are returned to their rightful 
owners, and avert imminent dangers threatening this nation. The 
Jordanians and Palestinians will not hesitate to continue the 
march they have started along the path of unity, which reflects 
strongly cherished sentiments within the hearts of all of them.

  [Excerpt] An official spokesman for the Foreign Ministry 
has stated that official memorandums have been exchanged between 
the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the 
Vatican as a prelude to establishing diplomatic relations at an 
ambassadorial level between the two countries. 
  The spokesman pointed out that intensive and continued 
contacts are under way through diplomatic channels on this 
issue. An announcement on taking this step will be made soon, 
he said. 
  The spokesman added that final arrangements will be worked 
out to translate the cordial and distinguished relations between 
Jordan and the Vatican. His Majesty King Husayn and His 
Holiness Pope John Paul II are eager to entrench these 
relations, so they will enjoy much respect and appreciation 
proceeding from the historic and distinguished bilateral 
relations, he noted. 
  The Vatican's official spokesman, Dr. (Navarro Valse), said 
Jordanian-Vatican relations are good and fruitful. In a news 
conference held at the Vatican, he added that the Vatican also 
has good relations with many regional states, and has contacts 
on fruitful cooperation with some of them. He particularly 
pointed to relations with Jordan, and asserted that Christians 
in Jordan enjoy unequalled privileges. Dr. (Valse) added that 
out of their desire to put these good relations in an 
institutional framework, the two sides began to negotiate the 
establishment of full diplomatic relations. There was an 
agreement on this issue. 
  (Valse) explained that the arrangements on this issue are 
about to be finalized, and that they will be announced soon. He 
expressed the hope that this step will be a catalyst to enhance 
the current cooperation with Jordan that has long contributed to 
supporting and promoting the peace process. He indicated 
Jordan's great role in regional stability and security.

  [Text] Amman, Dec 31 (AFP) - Jordan's Islamic Action Front, 
a key party with 16 seats in the 80-member Chamber of Deputies, 
on Friday [31 December] slammed the Vatican-Israel accord 
calling for diplomatic ties next year. 
  "The recognition reflects allegiance by the Christian 
spiritual leadership to zionist hegemony," the front said in a 
statement received by AFP. 
  "It also reflects the zionist movement's success in 
Judaizing 
the western church and exploiting its leadership to achieve 
zionist objectives," it said. 
  Israeli and Vatican officials said the agreement, which was 
signed in Jerusalem on Thursday, avoided the status of East 
Jerusalem which has yet to be determined in Israeli-PLO 
negotiations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "On Ties and Jerusalem"] </F>
  [Text] The agreement between Israeli and the Vatican to 
establish political ties, which was signed in Jerusalem on 
Thursday [30 December], is most unfortunate since it amounts to 
recognition by the Holy See of Israel's sovereignty over the 
Holy City. In article 3 of the agreement, Israel, without 
mention of Jerusalem, "recognises the Catholic Church's right to 
practise its authority." The fact that the negotiations leading 
to the accord were conducted in Jerusalem and the agreement 
itself was signed in the city can only reinforce that conclusion. 
  We understand that the Vatican had come under immense 
pressure to conclude such an agreement with Israel by constantly 
having been reminded of all the atrocities that were committed 
against the Jews in Europe over the centuries, with the blessing 
of the church on many occasions. True, the Vatican is certainly 
not a superpower in the physical sense of the word. Yet, being 
the spiritual leader of 1,000 million Catholic faithfuls, the 
Pope, in whatever action he takes, serves as a guiding example 
for those millions. 
  It is therefore disappointing to see the Vatican turning a 
blind eye to Israel's description of the occupied Arab lands as 
'disputed territories." equally disappointing is to witness the 
Vatican's deputy foreign minister, Monsignr Claudio Celli, sign 
the document of mutual recognition with his Israeli counterpart 
Yossi Beilen in Jerusalem. 
  The Vatican cannot claim, as it did when it signed the 
agreement Thursday, a stranger to all temporal conflicts," 
because it is not. In the past decade and during Pope John 
Paul's reign, the Vatican was party to almost every single 
"temporal conflict" in Europe, Latin America and Africa. It 
chose to oppose and fight communism in Eastern Europe. It sided 
with the U.S. in fighting the Sandinista government in 
Nicaragua. And Pope John Paul himself did not hesitate to scold 
his Sudanese hosts last year for the brutal war in south Sudan. 
  Muslim and Christian Arabs are disheartened therefore to see 
the Vatican take a step towards legitimising Israel's occupation 
and annexation of the city and the Holy See's backtracking in 
commitment pledged to Arabs and Palestinians. This move at this 
crucial time will only strengthen the hands of Israel and weaken 
the Palestinian cause at a time where every genuine effort 
should be exerted to solve the Middle East peace conflict justly 
and honourably.

  [Text] Cairo, 1 Jan (MENA)--Sa'id Kamal, Palestinian 
ambassador in Cairo, has praised Egypt's diligent efforts to 
promote the peace process in the region and bring closer the 
Palestinian and Israeli views on the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA today, Kamal said that 
President Husni Mubarak had exerted special efforts to maintain 
consultations and coordination among all the Arab parties 
concerned with peace in the Middle East. He stressed that the 
PLO and President Yasir 'Arafat are interested in cooperating 
and consulting with Syria. He pointed out that despite the 
Palestinian side's preoccupation with the negotiations with 
Israel during the past two months, contacts between Damascus and 
the PLO continued through diplomatic channels. 
  Kamal expressed his belief that nothing prevents a meeting 
between 'Arafat and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad before the 
Geneva summit between al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton on 
17 January.

<F P=106> [Speech by leader of the revolution Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi to </F>
the masses of al 'Assah region; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Hello. First, it is good that you have arranged 
this meeting in this tent, this family-like atmosphere, instead 
of having to make speeches in public squares. This is much 
better, a family-like, brotherly meeting. 
  First, I am happy with your high morale and readiness for 
confrontation. This is not unusual for you as your kinfolk and 
your forefathers were the heroes of the battle of Sidi 'Abd al 
Samad, Al Dhlila, Sidi Said, Sidi 'Ali, Al Gdaline [against the 
Italian invading army in 1911]. History is a witness to the 
courage of your kinfolk, and their confrontation with foreign 
invasion, particularly after the fall of Zouara, and the enemy's 
attempt to advance toward Al 'Ujaylat, the mountains, and 
Fazzan. [passage omitted] 
  Now there is another confrontation, in another era, with 
different methods. So far, the battle has not reached the level 
it had attained with the Italians, with rifles, bullets, and 
machine-guns. So far, the battle continues with the enemy, but 
with other weapons and other methods. We want to be very 
careful this time. We do not want the enemy to laugh at us. The 
enemy fears us. It says: This land has an armed and trained 
people, prepared for confrontation. It will bring us other 
methods. We must be careful about this. [Crowd chants slogans: 
"Hang them in the public square," "O leader, do not show mercy 
to any traitor"] 
  Yes, the enemy sometimes takes into consideration the fact 
that we are a people prepared to fight, prepared for armed 
resistance. Sometimes it avoids military confrontation, but it 
enters the battle with us in another way. We must be vigilant 
to this. 
  This is what we should be aware of as a people who want to 
be 
victorious in this battle, and this confrontation, and allow 
this period to pass without the enemy achieving victory over us. 
  Our forefathers fought the Italians for years and years. The 
Italians had a super power state in those days in comparison to 
the Libyans. [passage omitted] 
  We are now in better shape. We are a trained and armed 
people and more numerous in number. Our population is larger 
now than in the past. We have industry, agriculture, water, and 
potential. We can fight and continue the battle for a longer 
period. Your kinsfolk and forefathers here were the area's 
lions and protectors. They confronted the Italians and offered 
their lives in sacrifice to prevent them advancing to 'Ujaylat, 
Jabal Nafusa, and Fazzan. 
  What is required of you in this place, which is called Al 
'Assah, is that you be the guards...[crowd shouts slogans] What 
is required of you is that you will be protectors of the area 
once again as your fathers and forefathers had been. 
  Defense is a patriotic duty to protect the economy, the 
national product, and the Libyan dinar. We are not going to 
sell our homeland for our stomach. We do not protect our 
borders by a police force, by helicopters, or desert vehicles. 
We protect them by our conscience and our patriotism. We are 
committed, not to do these things [encroach on borders] and we 
will prevent anyone from doing them. That is protection. 
[crowd chants] 
  Our ancestors neither lived by smuggling nor did they rely 
on 
Italian goods. How could they have fought against Italy if they 
had been importing everything from it? We are now in a 
situation as if we were fighting against America, so we are not 
importing American goods. We are doing without them. We are as 
if we were fighting against France and Britain, and we are not 
importing goods from Paris and London. Our independence, 
sovereignty, and honor are above goods. [passage omitted] 
  Those who stretched their hands and dealt in francs sold us 
out. They enabled the Italians to reach Fazzan [in southern 
Libya] and enabled them to trample over the bodies of our 
martyrs. 
  The traitor now is not just afraid of being referred to 
public prosecution and the court, he is afraid that his family 
and his house may be burned, and the masses may storm him. Who 
can prevent the masses, when on a night of anger they stampede 
into a farm, a house, two houses, or a whole quarter, and burn 
and destroy them? In fact, neither the police nor anyone crying 
out over a loudspeaker is going to stop a deluge. However much 
you shout, you cannot stop a deluge. The masses are like a 
deluge. [crowd chants] 
  There is no place for treachery now. One cannot say that 
those who have betrayed would be subject to the law and the 
court. No, there are the masses. All the Libyan tribes are 
determined to strom the house and property of a traitor, and to 
burn him and his family. The situation has become unbearable. 
In fact no one can prevent them. I regret that the situation 
should come to this, but those are the masses. 
  Traitors used to be referred to the law and the court and 
that was sufficient for us. However, the masses are above the 
law, above courts and above everything. [passage omitted] 
  The masses can storm any place without mercy or pity where 
treachery is concerned. This has occurred before my eyes. 
Al-Ja'akah's [a Libyan national reported to have supplied 
evidence concerning the Lockerbie incident to the West] family 
were about to be cut to pieces in front of me. The masses said: 
Even if you provide guards for any traitorous family, we will 
storm the guards. We will regard them as protectors of 
treachery. 
  Confrontation is now in this manner. The Muslim brothers 
are treacherous; the Islamic Liberation Party is treacherous; 
al-Takfir wal Hijrah [Islamic movement in Egypt] is treacherous; 
the Da'wah, the Jihad, the Zandaqah, all these movements have 
foreign intelligence behind them. They are involved in 
smuggling; they deal in dollars, foreign exchange, consumer 
goods; they run after Western goods. All this is treason. If 
we were to face up to the enemy we must be at a high level of 
awareness, comprehension, and determination. We must know what 
weapons are required for the battle. 
  If hundreds of kilometers separate you from the enemy, I do 
not believe that one should get hold of a rifle or a revolver, 
aim at the enemy and shoot him, because there is a weapon that 
corresponds with a long distance. When you are face to face 
with the enemy, sometimes even the rifle is no good, and steel 
weapons are used. That is the best weapon in this case. One 
should know the right weapon needed for close combat. We must 
know the right weapon for the battle now raging between us and 
the West so that we may defeat the enemy. If the enemy is 
shooting at you with a machine-gun and you have a revolver, then 
that is not it. The machine-gun has a range that a revolver 
cannot reach. You would not be able to touch the enemy, who 
would defeat you. 
  Let us live like our forefathers used to live, a clean life, 
a life accepted by our own conscience, a life that allows us to 
be free with our heads held high, relying on our land, our 
animals, our farming, our trees, palm trees, olive trees, 
relying on ourselves, our own production. But if we keep 
looking across the sea at their consumer goods and then 
challenge them, we would not be able to do so. I have already 
told you: If our forefathers were relying on Italian canned 
food, or if they were dealing in Italian lire, then we would not 
have been able to fight Italy. How could we have fought Italy 
while eating, drinking, and dressing with its products? [passage 
omitted] 
  Great, that is it, exactly. Great. In reality you people in 
Al 'Assah area do not need a speech from me. You do not need a 
long speech. You understand what I have been saying. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Fierce fighting continues between the Afghan Defense 
Ministry and General Dostam's forces in Kabul. 
  According to a report by the Central News Unit in Kabul, 
clashes have raged since yesterday in the capital of 
Afghanistan, and so far hundreds of people have been killed or 
wounded. Also, thousands of shells, mortars, and rockets have 
hit the warring sides positions and various areas of Kabul. 
  Kabul Radio and Television, which is controlled by the 
supporters of President Borhanoddin Rabbani, strongly attacked 
General Dostam and announced that he has been stripped of all 
his legal and official powers. 
  Borhanoddin Rabbani last year appointed General Dostam as 
the 
first deputy of the Afghan Defense Ministry. 
  According to the Kabul Radio and Television, Hekmatyar's 
Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] forces are 
confronting the Defense Ministry forces and are fighting 
alongside General Dostam's forces. 
  Rasul Sayyaf, the leader of the Etehad-e Eslami [Islamic 
Union of Afghanistan] and the main ally of Afghan President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani, also stressed, during a speech broadcast on 
that country's radio and television, that battles will continue 
until the complete annihilation of the Northern Movement led by 
General Dostam. 
  The report of the Voice and Vision correspondent from Kabul 
mentions that again today the Iranian Embassy in Kabul became 
the target of a mortar attack during the exchange of fire 
between the warring sides, but none of the embassy workers were 
harmed.

  [Text] The Sudanese Government has decided that the 
presence of UK Ambassador to Sudan Peter Streams does not serve 
the interests of the two countries. The relevant authorities 
have therefore given Streams two weeks to leave the country. 
  Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, speaker of the Transitional 
National Assembly, declared during a news conference yesterday 
that the British ambassador was behind the postponement of the 
archbishop of Canterbury's visit to Sudan. Mr. Khalifah said 
peaceful coexistence between religions and the good spirit 
prevailing between the Muslims and the Christians of Sudan 
constituted the motives for enemies to conspire and for intrigue 
to occur in an effort to shake up the stability being enjoyed by 
the people of Sudan. 
  Meanwhile, Bishop Gabriel Rorech, minister of state at the 
Foreign Ministry, said the British ambassador was working to 
create distortions and differences between the government and 
the Episcopal Church in Sudan.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by political </F>
correspondent Shlomo Raz and Rafi Rosenfeld on 31 December; 
place not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Raz] Mr. Rabin, there 
seems to be a crisis, a stalemate, or a delay -- I wonder what 
word you would use -- in the talks today, the day of our 
interview with you. A fax was received from Nabil Sha'th, in 
which the PLO was practically backing out of some of the 
agreements achieved in Cairo -- at least agreements on the issue 
of the crossings on the Jordan bridges. 
  [Rabin] True, we are faced with a problem, but things should 
be put in the right perspective. Both sides, the Israeli and 
the Palestinian -- the PLO -- are committed to the Declaration 
of Principles [DOP] agreement, to the negotiations, to the 
implementation of the first stage of the Gaza-Jericho First 
agreement. And there are disagreements. Following the Paris 
and Oslo meetings, the nucleus of the Israeli-Palestinian 
liaison committee met in Cairo, with the Israeli side headed by 
Foreign Minister Peres and the other side by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh 
in Paris and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] in Cairo. We received 
the impression that they had arrived at a draft reflecting the 
agreements on some of the main disputed issues. The agreement 
was naturally contingent on the endorsement of both Tunis and 
Jerusalem. 
  It transpired, however, that so far Tunis has not endorsed 
the draft. For that reason, there has been no endorsement from 
Jerusalem, because it is inconceivable that we should agree to 
approve something Tunis has not approved. Had we done it, the 
draft which required reciprocal endorsement would have become a 
unilaterally endorsed draft, and that would have made it the 
starting point of negotiations, triggering new compromises 
beyond anything the two sides had agreed on. 
  Two faxes have been received. One was from Nabil Sha'th, 
written after the meeting with President Mubarak in Cairo, after 
Nabil Sha'th and Major General Amnon Shahaq were tasked with 
elucidating several points in the draft. Shahaq and Sha'th had 
a conversation, but due to time constraints, they agreed that a 
fax reflecting the agreements would be sent. Another fax from 
Nabil Sha'th which arrived yesterday contained far-reaching 
remarks by the chairman and, although they were defined as 
remarks, they practically overturned the contents of the first 
fax. 
  In these circumstances, I would like to spell out my stand. 
We are committed to the DOP. We are ready to negotiate the 
interpretations of whatever is written in the DOP agreement. I 
absolutely refuse, however, to make additional compromises on 
the agreements achieved in the DOP agreement. Interpretation -- 
yes, another compromise -- no. 
  [Raz] And does that interpretation of 'Arafat -- the 
chairman, as you referred to him -- reflect a retreat from every 
previous agreement on the issues of Gaza, the scope of 
withdrawal from Jericho, the bridges, and the crossings? 
  [Rabin] They are remarks implying a retreat. They are not 
presented as demands, but the implications of the second fax are 
clear to me. Therefore, although we would like to continue the 
negotiations, we would like to ponder the matter and to 
elucidate a few things at the beginning of next week, before the 
negotiations are resumed, in order to avoid departing from a new 
starting line each time, because we believe that the agreements 
should bind both sides. [passage omitted] 
  [Rosenfeld] Recently there have been reports about Israelis 
and Syrians participating in a workshop in Washington. Do you 
have any information about this track of talks? Does it operate 
with your knowledge, your sanction, your consent? 
  [Rabin] Neither I nor the Government of Israel have 
authorized anyone to conduct negotiations with the Syrians. We 
were very interested in holding quiet contacts with the Syrians, 
because the experience of the Dayan-al-Tuhami meeting in Morocco 
had proved that this kind of meetings can pave the way. Oslo 
has proved the same. We wanted very much to hold such meetings, 
but the Syrians refused. Therefore, I do not know what the 
newspaper reports were based on. Israelis may have met with 
Syrians on occasion, but not one of these Israelis had been 
authorized by either me or the Government of Israel to speak on 
our behalf. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Certain quarters are seeking to confuse the domestic 
Lebanese situation, particularly at the security level. The 
CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY cites informed sources as saying that an 
attempt to assassinate President Ilyas al-Hirawi a month ago has 
been uncovered. The security agencies arrested a number of 
suspects and they are being interrogated. 
  The security agencies apprehended a network in the north a 
few days ago. The network is suspected of engineering recent 
explosions in different areas; its members belong to extremist 
groups that seek to sow sedition by undermining stability. 
  The security agencies have also apprehended members of a 
network in the south, made up of extremist Palestinians who 
cooperate mostly with Lebanese elements with criminal records. 
They are being interrogated to discover any links between the 
various attempts to undermine stability, the latest of which was 
the explosion at the Phalangist Party's central headquarters.

  [Text] The president of Turkmenistan, Saparmurad Niyazov, 
arrived this morning in Tehran for a five-day visit at the head 
of a delegation, and was officially welcomed by President 'Ali 
Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. Our correspondent reports: 
  [Correspondent] After arriving in Tehran, Niyazov praised 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani as a distinguished international political 
and cultural figure and spoke about the depth of friendship, the 
strength of brotherhood, and the scope of cooperation between 
the two countries. 
  The president of Turkmenistan spoke of Hashemi-Rafsanjani's 
trip to his country as an unforgettable event for the people of 
Turkmenistan and said: Iran is a powerful and influential 
country in the world, and Turkmenistan, through an emphasis on 
its relations with the Islamic Republic, uses the experiences of 
the Iranian Government and people in development. 
  He emphasized that cooperation between the two countries is 
not to the detriment of other countries, and that the countries 
of Central Asia and member countries of the Commonwealth, in 
their recent session in Ashgabat, stressed their interest in 
expanding relations with Iran. 
  In turn, Hashemi-Rafsanjani spoke about the process of 
cooperation between the two countries and said: 
  [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] In the name of God, the 
compassionate, the merciful. I think cooperation between Iran 
and Turkmenistan, is an example of good relations between two 
sincere neighbors. We have achieved good progress since 
Turkmenistan achieved independence and the process of 
cooperation continues. During my recent trip to Turkmenistan we 
made important decisions. The people of Turkmenistan showed 
that they have extraordinary interest in cooperating with Iran. 
Turkmenistan's presidenct, His Excellency Mr. Niyazov, 
ministers, and other officials extended their best regards and 
following our invitation, Niyazov, accompanied by a high-ranking 
and wide-ranging delegation, has now come to Iran. The 
composition of their delegation indicates their wish to work 
with Iran in all fields, and this we welcome. They have also 
put aside sufficient time to stay in Iran, again indicating the 
importance of this relationship. They also intend to visit 
various parts of the country, again indicating their interest in 
Iran. We did the same while in Turkmenistan. I think this 
could be a good example for the world, of relations between two 
countries. God willing. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] This is the third time that Niyazov is 
visiting Iran in the past three years since Turkmenistan 
achieved independence. He is being accompanied by 14 senior 
government officials, including vice presidents, ministers, and 
governors.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali has said that 
the prime minister's visits to China and the DPRK were 
successful and the leaders of the two countries have agreed to 
expand cooperation with Pakistan in various fields. Addressing 
a news conference in Islamabad this afternoon, he said the 
leaders of the two countries emphasized effective cooperation in 
the defense field. He said China and the DPRK appreciate 
Pakistan's stand on the Jammu and Kashmir issue and have 
expressed sympathy with the Kashmiris for their hardships under 
Indian occupation. 
  The foreign minister said the Chinese leaders categorically 
stated that the Sino-Pakistani friendship is a model friendship 
that has withstood every test of time, and that the ties between 
the two countries will always enjoy special significance. The 
Chinese leaders assured the prime minister that the improvement 
in Sino-Indian relations will not affect the special 
relationship between Pakistan and China. The foreign minister 
added that the leaders of China and Pakistan enjoy total 
unanimity and understanding on major international and regional 
issues, and the two countries have agreed to work toward a new 
international order based on the principles of the UN Charter. 
The two countries have also agreed to oppose hegemony at the 
global and regional levels, because this is the root cause of 
expansionism and regional and racial tensions. 
  The foreign minister said the prime minister apprised the 
Chinese leaders of the atrocities and human rights violations 
committed by Indian forces, which have intensified since the two 
countries agreed to hold talks at the level of foreign 
secretary. He said the prime minister called for tangible steps 
to end the repression and violence. He said Pakistan wants to 
reduce tension in the region by resolving the Kashmir dispute 
through negotiations. The foreign minister added that the 
Chinese leaders appreciated Pakistan's stand and welcomed the 
foreign secretarial-level talks. 
  The foreign minister said the prime minister briefed the 
Chinese leaders on Pakistani-U.S. relations and the negative 
effects of the Pressler Amendment. He said Pakistan favors 
nuclear nonproliferation at the global and regional levels, and 
referred to Pakistan's proposal for a five-nation conference. 
He said the Chinese leaders fully appreciate the Pakistani 
proposal. 
  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said that Pakistan supports China on 
the missile issue, and asserted that the supply of Chinese 
missiles to Pakistan did not violate the principles of the 
Missile Technology Control Regime. The Pakistani side 
highlighted the importance of the Karkoram Highway and supported 
the Chinese stand on Tibet, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. 
  In reply to another question, the foreign minister said that 
the PRC has expressed deep grief and concern over the serious 
human rights violations in occupied Kashmir and the atrocities 
being carried out there. They expressed sympathy with the 
Kashmiri people and supported the Pakistani stand on the Kashmir 
issue. The Chinese leaders assured Pakistan that they will help 
Pakistan whenever needed. 
  On Ms. Benazir Bhutto's visit to Korea, the foreign minister 
said that the prime minister and the DPRK president exchanged 
views on global and regional issues. The DPRK supported the 
Pakistani stand on the Kashmir issue and the relevant UN 
resolutions. He said that Pakistan hopes that the differences 
between the DPRK and other countries will be resolved peacefully.

  [Text] Reports from Irbil say that six clergymen have been 
killed or executed by the gang of the agent Jalal Talabani and 
that many mosques have been severely damaged as a result of 
artillery shelling of al-Sulaymaniyah and Irbil cities, and the 
Chamchamal, Darbandikhan, Kallar, and Raniyah districts. It is 
reported that more than 200 casualties fell in Kallar. 
  Reports earlier said that the security situation was still 
tense in Irbil and al-Sulaymaniyah and that most shops are 
closed and life paralyzed. Sound of explosions and guns are 
heard on the outskirts of Irbil and al-Sulaymaniyah. All roads 
connecting towns, districts, and townships have been closed by 
warring gangs. Hospitals are full of dead and wounded with no 
medical attention. People do not have the means to obtain food. 
  Reports from al-Sulamaniyah say that the gang of agent 
Mas'ud 
Barzani and the gang of agent Jalal Talabani are massing their 
saboteurs in and around al-Sulaymaniyah to begin a new round of 
fighting. This time the two sides will fight directly to 
heighten the tragedy which they created in the region.

  [Text] Paveh, Kermanshah Prov., Dec. 30, IRNA -- Sporadic 
clashes between forces of Iraq's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan 
(PUK) and Islamic Movement of Iraq's Kurdistan still continues 
in northern Iraq. PUK forces have called on members of the 
Islamic Movement to give up and said that they have smashed 
positions of the Islamic movement. 
  However, according to sources close to the Islamic movement, 
they have pushed back Jalal Talabani forces from al-Tuwaylah 
region. According to the Islamic movement forces under the 
command of Mullah 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz, in overnight fightings, 
at least six PUK members were killed and five others were taken 
captive. No independent source has yet confirmed the reports. 
  Meanwhile, mediatory efforts by leader of Iraq's Democratic 
Party of Kurdistan (DPK) Mas'ud Barzani to patch up differences 
between the rival groups have failed. The withdrawal of Barzani 
from the leadership council of Iraq's Kurdistan is a sign of his 
failure to end the hostilities. Other reports speak of fresh 
clashes between Talabani and Barzani forces in Irbil region, 20 
kms southeast of al-Sulaymaniyah. 
  In light of the recent clashes, political observers believe 
that none of the two main rival groups in northern Iraq are able 
to run an independent Kurdish government.

  [Text] Baghdad, 1 Jan (INA)--Reports from the Kurdistan 
Autonomous Region in northern Iraq say more than 110 persons 
have been killed in the ongoing battles between the group of 
agent Jalal al-Talabani, agents of America and Britain, and the 
group of Khalid 'Uthman Barzani, agents of Iran. Hundreds of 
civilians have been wounded in this fighting. 
  In a report published here today, AL-JUMHURIYAH's 
correspondent in Ninawa quotes these reports and people coming 
from al-Sulaymaniyah and Irbil Governorates as saying that more 
than 56 people were killed in these battles over the past week. 
AL-JUMHURIYAH's report adds that the number of those killed 
over the past week is more than those killed over the past two 
months, that is, since the beginning of the fighting between the 
two agent groups. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH notes that the agent groups -- which control 
the Autonomous Region in northern Iraq under the protection of 
the allied forces and aircraft that take off from southern 
Anatolia -- are hiding the number of civilian casualites. It is 
believed, the paper adds, that the number of victims is 
increasing now that the fighting has extended from the military 
areas, which are under the control of the two groups, to 
villages and subdistricts in al- Sulaymaniyah and Irbil 
Governorate. 
  The reports added that over the past two weeks 
al-Sulaymaniyah was the target of arbitrary shelling from 
launchers and mortar guns. The reports said the shelling, which 
lasted for more than 10 straight days, resulted in the killing 
and wounding of hundreds of people and the destruction of houses 
and mosques. 
  AL-JUMHURIYAH's correspondent noted that Irbil's streets are 
full of bodies and burned vehicles. He added that shops and 
markets were looted during the barbaric shelling.

  [Text] It has been reported that the clashes which erupted 
10 days ago in northern Iraq between forces affiliated with 
Jalal Talabani and the pro-Iranian Islamic Movement of Kurdistan 
are continuing. 
  In a statement to ANATOLIA agency in London, the Islamic 
Movement of Kurdistan declared that its forces seized the 
townships of Balkhah and Ahmad Awah, which occupy a strategic 
point from a transportation standpoint. The statement denied 
reports that 'Uthman 'Abd-al-'Aziz, leader of the Islamic 
Movement of Kurdistan, was captured last week by the Patriotic 
Union of Kurdistan led by Talabani. The statement noted that 
'Abd-al-'Aziz is currently conducting talks in Salah-al-Din to 
stop the clashes with Mas'ud Barzani. 
  The statement further claimed that in the recent clashes, 
Talabani's forces were helped by Iranian communist Kurdish 
organizations and former PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] 
militants. Charging that the recent elections held in northern 
Iraq were rigged, the statement said that Barzani and Talabani 
failed to keep their promises to renew the elections and 
everyone should learn that Talabani's words cannot be trusted.

northeastern Iraq, have said that the Jalal Talabani's clique 
has assembled a large number of its armed men in Hawraman to 
launch a large-scale attack on the members of the so-called 
Islamic Movement of Kurdistan. Earlier, this movement announced 
that it resumed its armed operations against Jalal Talabani's 
clique and seized the Ahmad Awah mountains overlooking the 
al-Sulaymaniyah-Halabjah highway. The Islamic Movement of 
Kurdistan also announced that the villages of Balkhah, Byara, 
and Tawilah are now under its control and that it killed 15 
people and arrested 25 members of the Jalal Talabani group.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Our talk yesterday should have dealt with the 
phenomenon of extremism and revanchism [al-salafiyah] in Islam, 
in view of the danger, difficulty, and [word indistinct] that 
such radicalism poses to the noble Islamic religion. The rapid 
succession of events prevented this, however. At the same time, 
my personal closeness to these rapid events during two full 
nights and two full days in the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan's 
[PUK] operations rooms provided a motive for writing this 
commentary. 
  PUK leaders ran the operations with a presence of mind that 
demonstrated wisdom, experience, and political, military, and 
psychological competence. The telephone did not stop ringing, 
and there was an endless flood of volunteer fighters. Everyone 
in the operations room, particularly the PUK leaders, were 
emphatically determined that no harm should befall venerable 
al-Sulaymaniyah and its dear citizens, especially the women and 
children. 
  The sight of veteran peshmergas, those who fought in the 
difficult battles of the past, streaming to the place with their 
weapons in hand was unforgettable. I even saw among them a 
group of elderly men and others in suits and ties who came late 
at night to take up arms. 
  Women, children, and innocent men were killed or wounded 
when 
the terrorists turned their mortar fire, katyushas, and Grads 
against peaceable homes. Doctors and nurses hurried to help the 
wounded at all hours of the night and day, spurred on by their 
professional sense of duty and patriotic and humanitarian 
sentiments. Their honorable and humanitarian action is 
difficult to forget. 
  This is only a small part of what I saw. 
  On the subjects of war and politics, we declare: What 
happened was not a war between the PUK and the Muslims. Before 
the matter was settled decisively, as we have seen, the PUK made 
strenuous efforts on all levels to resolve the issue peacefully. 
  Political parties in the Kurdish liberation movement made 
valuable efforts to salvage the situation and safeguard the 
citizens' lives. However, the extremist, terrorist, radical 
movement sought a war of extermination. We can see now how the 
consequence was the end of the terrorists' extremism. We have 
seen how citizens, normally uninvolved in politics, participated 
in deciding the issue for the good of Kurdistan and its people, 
not merely for the good of the PUK. 
  Yes, it has been a national victory. We have driven off the 
specter of fear and danger that threatened our country and our 
people. Nevertheless, the PUK must continue to be wary of 
falling victim to vanity. In the future, the PUK must be even 
more humble than it is now. It must conduct its transactions 
with other parties in a humble manner, with the wisdom of the 
victor and the knowledge of one conversant with all things. 
  Yes, the momentous event has demonstrated the Kurdish 
people's support for the PUK and how the veteran peshmergas and 
veteran PUK members backed their triumphant party, just as they 
have always supported it during good and bad times. 
  At this point, we want to comment on an astounding feature: 
Thousands of Grad missiles were found in the extremists' 
warehouses. Even the united army of Kurdistan does not possess 
such missiles. The kinds of weapons that are only used in 
sophisticated battles were also found. Hallowed houses of 
worship were used as trenches. 
  It was a wise and splendid thing that dear al-Sulaymaniyah 
and other cities of Kurdistan were protected from devastation. 
  To enable our nation to live in security and peace and to 
build up Kurdistan, let us all rise to the level of events and 
future contingencies. Let us reinforce our fraternity and 
mutual trust. Let all the parties of Kurdistan focus their 
efforts on bringing happiness to the people and defend them 
against terrorism.

<F P=106> [Column by Hasan Cemal: "As the Hizballah in Iraq Appears on </F>
the Scene"] 
  [Excerpt] An Islamic organization has surfaced in northern 
Iraq to carry out armed activities in that part of the country. 
It has identified itself as the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan 
[Kurdistan Islamci Hareketi, IMK]... 
  The IMK militants attacked the supporters of the Patriotic 
Union of Kurdistan, which is headed by Jalal Talabani. The 
attacks took place last Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday. The 
militants also clashed with the supporters of Mas'ud Barzani, 
leader of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan. The incidents were 
in Raniyah, Kifri, and Kujah... 
  The Hizballah in Iraq has established itself in Kuldazah and 
Raniyah, which are close to Iran's border. That organization is 
not represented in the Federal Assembly of Kurdistan, which is 
based in Irbil, because it only secured 5.1 percent of the votes 
in the elections in 1992. Seven percent of the vote was needed 
for representatin. 
<H5>  Iran's Support </H5>
  The Hizballah organization in Iraq is mainly supported by 
Tehran... It has received aid from Iran in the form of cash, 
arms, and provisions, particularly since 1991. That is common 
knowledge. According to Ahmad Bamarni, who is a close associate 
of Jalal Talabani, the Hizballah organization is also supported 
by Saudi Arabia and even by Afghanistan... That organization's 
ideology is based on Imam Khomeyni's teachings. Naturally, that 
provides for Tehran's support... Nevertheless, the Hizballah 
members have not renounced their religious sect. They are the 
followers of the Sunni sect. Of course, that accounts for Saudi 
Arabia's support. 
  The recent weakening of the economy in northern Iraq has had 
a significant bearing on the strengthening of the Hizballah 
organization. The gradual worsening of poverty has disappointed 
the people in the region. Consequently, that state of affairs 
has nourished Islamic radicalism, as has been the case among the 
Palestinian people and in Algeria. Obviously, Islamic 
radicalism has strengthened as a result of poverty and the 
central administration's failures. 
<H5>  Beards and Islamic Dress </H5>
  We met Ahmad Bamarni a few days ago. Referring to the 
Hizballah organization, he said: "We have a university in 
Irbil. It provides education for 5,000 students. We have 
colleges for agricultural and medical studies in Dahuk. We also 
have an institute for veterinary studies and a medical college 
in al-Sulaymaniyah... Students from many families do not attend 
them because they are poor. However, the IMK gives them an 
opportunity to study, provided that the male students wear a 
beard and female students wear Islamic dress. In fact, the 
number of young people who join this organization is gradually 
increasing." 
  Yes, the Hizballah organization employs several tactics to 
strengthen itself. Meanwhile, it also helps many people to have 
their own shops or establish their own businesses. I have 
observed the poverty in northern Iraq. In view of that, I am 
aware of what can be achieved even through small amounts of 
material aid. 
<H5>  What Does Tehran Fear? </H5>
  What does Tehran, which supports the Hizballah organization, 
wish to achieve in northern Iraq? Bamerni replied as follows: 
  The Hizballah organization is playing Iran's game. Tehran 
wishes to create instability in northern Iraq. Iran's military 
aircraft repeatedly bombed the northern Iraq border area some 
time ago. That country closed its border about three weeks ago. 
It closed down the border gates that give access to 
al-Sulaymaniyah, Hajj 'Umran, and Irbil... What worries Tehran 
is this: A democratic, pluralistic, and secular system is being 
established in northern Iraq for the first time. Political 
parties exists in Irbil and other large cities. There are 
newspapers, magazines, and radio networks. The people are 
expressing their opinion. The people also appear on television. 
The modernization process has made Tehran feel very uneasy. 
Iran's officials fear that the Kurds in Iran and the rest of 
Iraq may decide to adopt a similar model. They believe that 
that would be an unfavorable example for their country.

  [Text] Baghdad, 30 Dec (INA)--The newspaper AL-'IRAQ has 
warned against foreign schemes to destroy Iraq's Kurdistan. 
  In an editorial entitled "The Truth Will Prevail," AL-'IRAQ 
today says this terrible scheme was assigned to agents of the 
foreigner after they abandoned all nationalistic feelings and 
mortgaged their will to serve the enemies of Iraq and its unity 
and stability. 
  The paper adds: Observers are raising big questions about 
the objectives behind the various recent security breaches in 
Kurdistan and the role of the foreign hands that move the agents 
to sabotage security and stability and push the region to a 
phase of escalating fighting that will substantially harm the 
basic interests of the Iraqi Kurds. 
  The paper expects eliminations and countereliminations among 
the so-called parties to grow into a more serious phase that 
will threaten the lives of citizens in Kurdistan. The 
destructive consequences of this phase, the paper says, may 
affect the entire situation there. 
  The paper notes the suffering of the citizens of Iraqi 
Kurdistan as a result of the fighting among the agents which is 
reaching villages, towns, and districts in Irbil and 
al-Sulaymaniyah. 
  The paper notes a sharp and clear contrast between the state 
of tranquillity, stability, and security that prevailed in 
Kurdistan under the 17-30 July Revolution and the free, 
dignified life it had under the canopy of the homeland on the 
one hand, and the current dark and tragic state after the agent 
cliques took control, on the other. 
  The paper concludes its article by saying that this fact 
exposes the allegations and phony slogans that were raised to 
serve as pretexts.

  [Text] Baghdad, Dec. 30 (INA)--Secretary-General of the 
Works and Housing Administration in the Iraqi Kurdistan Autonomy 
Region Ghandi Muhammad Daza'i has asserted that the agent groups 
there have stolen during the past two years all engineering 
equipment and machines and vehicles of the state and smuggled 
them to neighbouring countries and deposited their prices at 
foreign banks. 
  He has made it clear that these thefts led to sabotaging all 
roads and bridges of the area because of the lack of maintenance 
and the region changed into a scene of only the phenomena of 
sabotage, ruin and destruction. 
  He made it clear that the Kurdish citizen was now holding 
comparison between the state of construction the region had been 
seeing for twenty years under the July 17 revolution and the 
state of devastation and destruction to which the region had 
been exposed in two years at the hands of the agents and 
mercenaries. 
  Secretary-General of Works and Housing in the Autonomy 
Region 
called on the citizens there to shoulder their responsibility 
and to stand up to the agent groups that were trying to destroy 
the Iraqi Kurds gains.

  [Text] The National Progressive and Patriotic Front [NPPF] 
has held a meeting under its secretary general, comrade 'Abd-al- 
Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, in the presence of the NPPF's party 
representatives. 
  During the meeting, comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur 
stressed that leader President Saddam Husayn's historic message 
in which he congratulated the great people of Iraq on the new 
year carries great meanings and bodes well for a happy, 
prosperous new year. 
  He noted that the killing and sabotage committed by the 
agent 
cliques in the Autonomous Region proves that these cliques are 
protected by their colonialist and Zionist masters. 
  He affirmed that our Kurdish people, who take pride in the 
historic leader struggler, President Saddam Husayn, will step up 
their struggle against these agent cliques. 
  During the meeting, the participants discussed a plan for 
the 
NPPF's General Secretariat for 1994 on the Arab and world 
levels, as well as political issues.

  [Text] The Legislative Council of the Kurdistan Autonomous 
Region has held its fourth and final meeting of this year's fall 
session. Speaker Baha'-al-Din Ahmad delivered a speech at the 
meeting in which he congratulated leader President Saddam Husayn 
and Iraq's people on the new year. He pledged to his excellency 
the president in the name of the members of the council to 
remain loyal soldiers to defend Iraq's sovereignty and its 
national unity. He also denounced the brutal crimes being 
committed by the cliques of agentry and destruction against our 
Kurdish people in the Kurdistan Autonomous Region in 
implementation of the colonialist and Zionist schemes. 
  During the meeting, three reports prepared by the general 
secretariats for economic, financial, awqaf, public works, and 
housing affairs were read out. The reports reviewed the 
achievements made by the sons of our Kurdish people in various 
areas up to 1990, including trade, religious, housing, and 
construction areas, in implementation of a decision by the 
leadership of the party and the revolution under leader Saddam 
Husayn to develop the Autonomous Region. In their reports 
endorsed by the council, the secretaries general dealt with the 
repercussions of the destruction carried out by the saboteurs 
against state institutions, as well as the stealing state of 
property. The meeting was attended by Ja'far 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Barzanji, chairman of the Executive Council of the Kurdistan 
Autonomous Region.

  [Text] Baghdad, 30 Dec (INA)--A responsible source at the 
Oil Ministry has ridiculed statements and allegations by the 
so-called oil minister in the Kuwaiti region, 'Ali Ahmad 
al-Baghli, blaming Iraq for the current drop in the oil prices 
because it has been sending signals of its imminent return to 
the market. 
  In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, the source said 
that 
these statements represent a desperate attempt to cover up the 
large-scale conspiracy being carried out by the U.S.-led 
colonialist forces through their agents in the region, including 
the rulers imposed on the Kuwaiti region, to plunder oil wealth. 
  The source added that the current collapse in the world oil 
market and the drop in oil prices to levels unprecedented for 
years are due to the overproduction of oil by the Kuwaiti region 
and Saudi Arabia, which are pumping more than 10 billion barrels 
per day in order to flood the market, lower prices, and deprive 
their peoples and those of the developing countries of their 
only source of income. 
  He asserted that what is going on in the market is a 
conspiracy being carried out by the rulers imposed on the 
Kuwaiti region and Saudi Arabia at the orders of their American 
masters to reduce oil prices and create obstacles to Iraq's 
return to the market. He said that these rulers are increasing 
their production of oil and dropping oil prices to delay Iraq's 
resumption of its legitimate role in exporting oil. 
  The source said that Iraq's resumption of its natural right 
to export its oil will only have a positive repercussions on 
prices, and that the states which have shared Iraq's quota 
should reduce their production to allow the absorption of the 
quantities to be exported by Iraq. 
  Concluding, the Oil Ministry source said: The return of 
Iraq, which believes in OPEC's principles and in the protection 
of the interests of its member states, will have positive 
repercussions that will serve its people's interests.

  [Excerpts] Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman this 
morning opened the 21st conference of the General Assembly of 
the Arab News Agencies Union [ANAU]. [passage omitted] 
  Information Minister Dr. Muhammad Salman delivered a speech 
in which he said: A few days ago, we bid farewell to 1993, 
which witnessed sweeping events throughout the world, the 
gravest of which in our region was the aggression Israel 
committed against Lebanon to depopulate the south and eradicate 
the peace process from its roots. Israel was calculating on the 
assumption that by its new aggression, it would be able to 
impose new facts in the arena of conflict in order to avoid the 
requirements of peace and to undermine the U.S. initiative, 
which considers the implementation of Security Council 
Resolutions 242 and 338 a basis for achieving a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region. 
  The minister pointed out that the second event was the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, which was born in the back corridors of 
Oslo away from the Madrid framework and the Washington talks and 
even further away from joint Arab coordination that Syria 
considers a true expression of the unity of the Arab position in 
the peace talks and its commitment to achieving peace on all 
tracks. 
  The information minister said that these two events were 
part 
of Israeli attempts to disavow the resolutions of the 
international legitimacy and to single out this or that Arab 
party by using force against it and drawing it into unilateral 
negotiations in order to create a deep rift in the Arab position 
and to impose the peace of the occupier and the outlaw. 
  Dr. Salman said President Hafiz al-Asad has asserted that a 
comprehensive and just peace requires an end to the occupation, 
aggression, injustice, and any other form of hegemony. 
Therefore, no one can divide peace or bargain over it. The 
minister also said that events proved the president's assertions 
to be true. Propagators of alternatives to the Madrid formula 
have not only lowered their voices, but also acted haphazardly 
in the crisis of their unilateral agreement. 
  The information minister touched on the summit expected to 
be 
held between President Hafiz al-Asad and President Bill Clinton 
in Geneva in 10 days amid a negative propaganda campaign aimed 
at harming the meeting and belittling its importance. He said: 
This summit will be held within the framework of the Syrian and 
U.S. efforts committed to achieving a just and comprehensive 
peace in the region. He expressed his hope that this important 
summit will produce good results that lead to the implementation 
of the resolutions of international legitimacy that Israel has 
been trying to disavow. 
  The minister also reaffirmed that everything pertaining to 
our national and pan-Arab issues shows the importance, on both 
the political and professional levels, of joint ANAU action in 
the field of news coverage in the Arab, regional, and 
international arenas. Dr. Salman stressed the importance of 
conveying facts to the Arab citizens and world public opinion, 
promoting Arab solidarity, defending our Arab nation's just 
causes, and explaining to the world our nation's achievements 
and human values. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, Jan 3 (AFP) -- The fifth round of 
negotiations on future trade relations between Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) began in Paris Monday 
behind closed doors, delegates from both sides announced. 
  It was unclear how long this latest round of talks, focusing 
on trade, labour, financial, banking and other economic issues, 
would last. 
  The head of the Israeli delegation, David Brodet, was not 
present at the talks Monday. The Palestinian delegation is 
headed by Muhammad Abu-Ghawsh, in charge of international 
economic issues for the PLO. 
  Israeli Foreign Minister Shi'mon Peres said in December that 
Israel had made various "concessions" to the PLO in terms of 
economic issues and was in favor of setting up a common market 
among Israel, Jordan and autonomous Palestinian territory.

<F P=106> [By Hamida Ben Salah] </F>
  [Text] Tunis, Jan 3 (AFP)--PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat came 
under new pressure Monday [3 January] to stop monopolizing key 
decisions on the peace talks with Israel and to make the 
organization more democratic. 
  "There is no hope for us if we don't practice real 
democracy," according to Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, head of a 
seven-member delegation which held talks here with 'Arafat and 
close colleagues on Sunday and Monday. 
  He told AFP it was too early to announce the results of the 
meetings which were to continue until Tuesday. 
  "We want to broaden the decision-making structure so that it 
does not stay entirely in Abu-'Ammar's ('Arafat's) hands," 
'Abd-al-Shafi, who led negotiations with Israel in Washington 
before the autonomy accord was signed in September, said after 
arriving in Tunis Sunday. 
  He added he would call for a "collective leadership." 
  'Arafat agreed to meet the delegation representing 120 
prominent Palestinians who two weeks ago sent the PLO leader and 
executive committee a petition calling for more democracy in the 
organization. 
  It called for mapping out a strategy for the self-rule 
negotiations with Israel, setting up a committee for directing 
the talks, and choosing negotiators based on merit rather than 
on political considerations. 
  The petition also demanded respect for human rights once the 
Palestine Liberation Organization assumes responsibility for 
affairs in the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. 
  At least six of the 12 executive committee members support 
the demands, according to a Palestinian official. 
  'Abd-al-Shafi, a founding PLO member who has for months 
demanded more democracy, said: "Committee appointments should 
not be made only on the basis of political and personal 
considerations." 
  He stressed the need to use Palestinians of ability at this 
"decisive" time, when the PLO and Israel are failing to make 
headway in implementing an accord for limited self-rule in the 
Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho. 
  Three leading figures in the Palestinian uprising against 
the 
Israeli occupation resigned December 26 in protest at 'Arafat's 
decision to name a 13-member council to head Fatah operations in 
the Gaza Strip. 
  'Arafat said the resignations had stemmed from a 
misunderstanding and promised "serious changes will be carried 
out" in the Fatah leadership in Gaza in order to satisfy the 
three. 
  But a draft constitution for the Palestinians during 
autonomy 
was published in Jerusalem last Thursday putting wide powers in 
'Arafat's hands. 
  'Arafat is named as the president of a highly-centralized 
system with a five-year term in office, renewable once only, but 
there is no reference to elections. 
  He controls the police and security forces, issues laws 
after 
ratification by the legislative authority, grants pardons and 
may hand out capital punishment. 
  The constitution guarantees an independent judiciary under 
the rule of law and recognizes freedom of religion, opinion and 
the press and the right to work. 
  On Saturday, 'Arafat's Fatah faction urged all Palestinian 
groups to help build a democratic state. 
  In a statement to mark the 29th anniversary of its creation, 
Fatah said "democracy and political pluralism" would be at the 
foundation of a Palestinian state and he pledged to "defend" the 
principles of democracy. 
  Talks on the final status of the occupied territories are to 
start in the third year of Palestinian self-rule. Opposed to 
the interim autonomy accord are several PLO factions and Moslem 
fundamentalist groups.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee member </F>
Sulayman al-Najjab by correspondent Sa'id Mu'addi, carried 
within the "With the Events" program; place and date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, [PLO] Executive 
Committee member, good evening. 
  [Al-Najjab] Good evening. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, the PLO leadership is 
holding intensive consultations and contacts in light of 
political developments. What is the PLO's position on these 
developments? 
  [Al-Najjab] If you mean the negotiations held with the 
Israeli side within the framework of the joint Liaison 
Committee, we are actually interested in reaching a solution to 
the issues this committee discussed in Oslo, at Versailles, and 
in Cairo recently. Regrettably, however, and as you know, the 
Cairo talks ended in nothing. To say that an agreement was 
reached is totally untrue. What really happened is that the 
Israeli side presented its viewpoint on the three issues; 
namely, the control of the crossing points, the Jericho area, 
and the settlements in Gaza and the security area required for 
them. 
  We replied to this Israeli position by submitting clear 
proposals to which we have committed ourselves since the 
Versailles meeting. Regrettably, we noted that in Cairo the 
Israeli position retreated from the approach on which we agreed 
in Paris, France. 
  Still pending is the issue of full Palestinian control of 
the 
crossing points leading to Gaza and Jericho in harmony with our 
control of these territories, from which the Israeli Army will 
withdraw. 
  [Mu'addi] What are the amendments requested by the 
Palestinian side concerning the agreement reached? 
  [Al-Najjab] No agreement was reached. As I told you, it was 
only an Israeli viewpoint that we regarded as an incomplete 
viewpoint. We still insist on controlling the crossing points 
leading to Gaza and Jericho. The Israeli Army's control of 
these territories, including the crossing points, will end when 
it withdraws from them. 
  We also demanded that the Jericho area be expanded, so it 
would include the Maqam al-Nabi Musa, which is a holy site for 
Muslims, and the site of al-Maghtas [the place where Jesus 
Christ was baptized in the River Jordan], which is, as you know, 
a holy site for Christians. We also demanded access to the Dead 
Sea coast and full control of the crossing point between the 
bridge [on the River Jordan] and the Jericho area. We adhere to 
this stand, and we believe that it is possible to reach 
practical solutions that can balance the [Israeli] principle of 
external security and the principle of no encroachment on the 
Palestinian control of these territories. 
  [Mu'addi] Will this new situation return us to square one? 
  [Al-Najjab] The new situation is supposed to return us to 
the path we began to follow at Versailles where viewpoints were 
close and where it was agreed to balance the two principles as I 
told you; namely, the control of the crossing points by the 
Palestinian side, and safeguarding the principle that external 
security will be in the hands of Israel. The crossing points 
are directly linked to internal security. As is stipulated in 
the agreement, this kind of security will be the responsibility 
of the Palestinian side, whether in Gaza, Jericho, or elsewhere 
in our occupied territories. 
  [Mu'addi] So, where are matters heading now? What are the 
coming steps? 
  [Al-Najjab] We indeed regard the Israeli position as a 
strange one. As I said, there is a clear retreat in this 
position. There is also an attempt to impose conditions on us. 
Of course, to resume negotiations based on the Israeli position 
defined in Cairo will not happen. Rabin said: Let the 
Palestinians sweat a little. We tell Rabin: We may sweat if we 
are in Jericho where the weather is warm now, but in Tunis the 
weather is cold and no one will sweat. 
  [Mu'addi] Sulayman al-Najjab, do you believe that the 
obstacles can be removed in the next few days and that the 
negotiations will resume in Taba? 
  [Al-Najjab] For our part, we are making every possible 
effort to remove these obstacles in a way that will grant us 
control of the crossing points to Gaza and Jericho. We are 
really interested in advancing the negotiations, so the 
Palestinian side will not be held responsible for wasting this 
historic opportunity. It all depends on the conduct of the 
Israeli side. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, PLO Executive Committee 
member, thank you very much. 
  [Al-Najjab] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif, adviser to PLO Chairman </F>
Yasir 'Arafat, by Faridah al-Shubashi, on 3 January; place not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Shubashi] Bassam Abu-Sharif, now that the 
Palestinian-Israeli talks are stumbling due to Tel Aviv's recent 
interpretation of the Oslo agreement, how can the Palestinians 
move when there are no terms of reference; the United Nations is 
excluded, and the United States said that it has nothing to do 
with the negotiations. How can two sides be left, one of which 
is Israel with all the power, capabilities, and resources it 
possesses, and the other, the unarmed Palestinian people? 
  [Abu-Sharif] The Declaration of Principles, which was signed 
in Washington, was signed at the White House in the presence of 
the United States, represented by its President and secretary of 
state, and other representatives of the world states, 
particularly the cosponsor of the peace conference that began in 
Madrid. Therefore, the U.S. and Russian responsibility here is 
clear. Undoubtedly, what the U.S. President had earlier said, 
to the effect that the United States is a full partner, gives 
the United States a moral, political, and practical 
responsibility to implement the Declaration of Principles and 
the plan to achieve peace in the region. We can explain the 
issue clearly as follows: If the Israeli Government really 
intends to achieve peace, then I see no logical reason for the 
Israeli Government to make out of the Jericho area or the 
crossings an obstacle to implementing the Gaza-Jericho First 
Plan. Based on this, I wish that the Israeli Government would 
take this into consideration, especially since confidence 
between the two sides is not entrenched, and because the plan to 
implement the Declaration of Principles is in itself a plan to 
bridge the gap of mistrust. I hope that the Israeli Government 
will not turn these points into obstacles because this is 
demoralizing and makes the Palestinians and Israelis lose hope 
in the possibility of achieving peace. However, if you want my 
personal opinion about what will happen afterwards, I say that 
the peace process will continue and all the current obstacles 
can be surmounted through calm negotiations free of tension and 
mistrust.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hamas official spokesman Muhammad Nazzal by </F>
Tal'at Rumayh and Mahmud Bakri in Khartoum in early December] 
  [Text] [AL-SHA'B] Brother Muhammad Nazzal, since the 
signing of the Declaration of Principles called the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, the question that keeps coming up is: What is Hamas' 
position on the representative institutions that will be elected 
after the implementation of the agreement? 
  [Nazzal] Hamas' decision is to boycott and not participate 
in 
the autonomy elections. This is because these elections are an 
inseparable part of the Gaza-Jericho plan. Hamas believes this 
plan eradicates the Palestinian cause. Consequently, not 
participating in these elections is harmonious with our 
rejection of this political plan. 
  [AL-SHA'B] However, there are those who demand that you act 
as an opposition within these Palestinian institutions. What is 
your reply? How do you envisage the intifadah under these new 
conditions? 
  [Nazzal] Hamas' opposition to this agreement is continuous. 
We do not believe there can be opposition through participation 
in these institutions. It is our opinion that participation in 
these elections is an acknowledgement and a tacit recognition of 
the legitimacy of this agreement. The issue is not related to 
an existing political system but concerns the land and the 
homeland. 
  As for the intifadah, it can be clearly seen that the 
military action has escalated quite a lot. It is clear that the 
number of Israeli casualties is constantly increasing. Perhaps 
it is one of the few times in which the number of Palestinian 
martyrs is equal to the number of dead Israelis. 
  [AL-SHA'B] This has caused great apprehensions about the 
possibility of Palestinian infighting as a result of this wide 
gap in positions. What practical measures have you taken to 
prevent this infighting? 
  [Nazzal] We believe the other side [PLO] is required to 
prove its good intentions regarding infighting. For our part, 
we have reiterated that we are against Palestinian fratricide. 
Political assassination is not our course. It is the other side 
that has issued threats and statements. 
  Therefore, the other side is required to prove its good 
intentions. For our part, an indication of our good intentions 
is that during the long course of the negotiations Hamas has not 
harmed any of the Palestinian negotiating delegation's members. 
We have issued no threats against anyone. Hamas has not 
assassinated any Palestinian for political reasons. 
  [AL-SHA'B] Shaykh Ahmad Yasin [Hamas leader now in Israeli 
jail] has recently sent several letters to Hamas which some 
lawyers believe contain directives to the Hamas leadership to 
adopt other means of struggle. 
  [Nazzal] Shaykh Ahmad Yasin's letters are clear and have 
been published by the media. He has clearly stated that he 
supports the continuation of military action against the 
occupation and the continuation of the resistance. He has 
answered some questions that Hamas has submitted to him, seeking 
his view on them. I do not believe there is disagreement. The 
escalation of the confrontation against the occupation is 
unanimously supported by all Hamas quarters. 
  [AL-SHA'B] What is your current status in the unified 
leadership of the intifadah? 
  [Nazzal] Hamas has never been a part of the so-called 
national leadership of the intifadah. This leadership was 
comprised of the parties participating in the PLO, namely the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Democratic 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the People's Party, and 
the Fatah movement. However, after the signing of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, Fatah and the People's Party withdrew 
from the unified national leadership in compliance with 
'Arafat's commitment to halt the intifadah. Thus, the unified 
national leadership has ceased to exist from the theoretical 
point of view. Moreover, it has also ceased to exist from the 
practical point of view, since the start of the negotiations in 
Madrid. 
  Following the Gaza-Jericho agreement, the 10 factions have 
decided to form the so-called national and Islamic leadership of 
the intifadah. This leadership will comprise the 10 factions' 
forces in the occupied territories. This leadership exists and 
we are a member of it. However, so far no final formula has 
been formulated for the work mechanism of this leadership. 
However, there is a real determination on our party to work 
through this leadership in the near future. 
  [AL-SHA'B] How do you evaluate the relationship between you 
and these factions, especially as there are huge ideological 
differences among you? Some analysts believe your agreement 
with them will not last long. 
  [Nazzal] The 10 factions are a formula that has existed 
despite the presence of ideological and political differences. 
The 10 factions do not share the same view regarding a 
settlement. Some factions believe in a political settlement. 
The 10 factions agree on their stand on the current settlement 
which is based on the Madrid conference. They agree on the need 
for the intifadah to continue. Therefore, we can say there is 
an agreement on a minimum common denominator. 
  [AL-SHA'B] Within the Islamic circle, is there coordination 
between you and the Islamic Jihad? 
  [Nazzal] In principle, we have no reservations about 
cooperating with any Palestinian group calling for the 
continuation of the resistance against occupation and rejecting 
the current plan. Hence, our hands are extended to all Islamic 
and non-Islamic Palestinian forces. 
  [AL-SHA'B] Does this mean there is no joint coordination 
within the Islamic ranks in particular? 
  [Nazzal] There is coordination with the Islamic Jihad within 
the framework of the 10 factions. 
  [AL-SHA'B] How do you see the next phase? 
  [Nazzal] I can say that as far as we are concerned, the 
resistance must continue in the next phase. We believe the 
continuation of the resistance will keep the Palestinian issue 
alive and will blow up all the bases of coexistence with this 
entity [Israel]. 
  I believe that the Gaza-Jericho agreement will be the bridge 
that the Israelis will use to enter the Arab region. Therefore, 
the Arabs and Muslims must fully realize that they are targeted 
by this agreement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, "Hamas official in </F>
Syria," by 'Ali al-Salih; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Salih] What is the truth about disagreements 
between Hamas and the Democratic Front [for the Liberation of 
Palestine] [DFLP] and the Popular Front [for the Liberation of 
Palestine] [PFLP] in the 10-factions [opposed to the peace 
process] framework? 
  [Mustafa] I do not believe there are any fundamental 
differences over the 10-factions issue and the need for them to 
remain as they are or to be developed. An agreement has been 
reached on a name for the alliance framework of these forces, 
namely the "Alliance of Palestinian Forces." But there was a 
disagreement over the previous name agreed by all parties, 
namely the "Palestinian Islamic National Alliance," on which the 
DFLP and the PFLP backtracked, demanding that it should be 
changed for fear of it becoming an ideological tendency as a 
result of the word Islamic. 
  [Al-Salih] What I meant were any political disagreements 
over 
the alliance's program. 
  [Mustafa] The disagreement over that question revolves 
around 
the resolutions adopted by the United Nations and recent Arab 
summits. The question raised was whether we should accept or 
reject these resolutions. The position of Hamas and the great 
majority of the 10 factions was to reject and not to recognize 
these resolutions, because they endorse the legitimacy of the 
Zionist presence in Palestine. The resolutions adopted by 
recent Arab summits endorsed this by accepting international 
Resolutions 242 and 338. We demanded the application of the 
resolution adopted by the Arab summit held in Khartoum in 1967. 
  There is a disagreement over the Palestinian national 
charter 
and its emphasis on the Arab and Islamic dimension of the 
Palestinian issue. The point of disagreement is that the DFLP 
is demanding the adoption of the PLO's phase program (the 
10-point program) endorsed by the Palestine National Council in 
1974. 
  [Al-Salih] Do you mean that they are demanding that the 
charter be amended? 
  [Mustafa] They are demanding that part of the phased program 
be added and UN resolutions endorsed. 
  [Al-Salih] The PFLP and the DFLP also attribute the 
disagreement to the big share you are demanding in the alliance 
leadership and your attempt to impose your influence on it. 
  [Mustafa] Several proposals were made when we agreed on 
calling the alliance the "Palestinian Forces Alliance" in order 
to form a central leadership for this alliance. For our part, 
we proposed that the Islamists (Hamas and the Islamic Jihad led 
by Dr. Fathi al-Shiqaqi) have one-third of the seats -- 
including independents -- in the leadership, namely 14 members 
out of 40. That is, four members for us and 10 independent 
members to be recommended by us. But our proposal was not 
accepted, especially by the PFLP and the DFLP. And the brothers 
in the Islamic Jihad requested that Hamas choose five 
independents and that it choose the other five, but Hamas 
rejected this offer. 
  As a result, and when we felt that some people wanted to 
marginalize Hamas' role, I thought that the movement should 
return to the proposal over which it had bargained with (PLO 
Chairman) Yasir 'Arafat, namely to demand 40 percent of the 
seats in the alliance leadership for it, 40 percent for the 
other factions, and 20 percent for the independents. 
  This is with regard to the central leadership. As for the 
alliance's executive committee, we proposed a 15-member 
formation in which each faction has one representative, provided 
the remaining members are selected by the central leadership. 
We also proposed that the chairmanship of the leadership be 
assumed by the factions in turn, provided that the deputy 
chairman be from among the independents and that an agreement be 
reached on who should be the secretary of the leadership. 
  We were supposed to hold a meeting to discuss these 
proposals 
but we preferred to postpone it until today in order to give the 
other factions a chance to study them. 
  [Al-Salih] But the other factions -- specifically the DFLP 
and the PFLP -- accuse you of evasion because of differences 
among your leadership ranks over your position on Israel and 
relations with the United States. What is your opinion? 
  [Mustafa] As I said, the meeting was postponed because we 
wanted to give them an opportunity to study the new proposals so 
that they will not come as a surprise to them. Because the 
meeting would be futile if the aim is just to present proposals. 
Second, because the brothers in the leadership were busy and 
could not come to Damascus. 
  [Al-Salih] But do you expect the factions to accept the 
40-percent proposal, when they, or some of them, rejected or did 
not accept the 30-percent proposal made by you and the Islamic 
Jihad? 
  [Mustafa] We are open-minded and willing to engage in 
dialogue and debate. This is our position in order to obtain 
our natural rights so that the alliance will go ahead and play 
its role. 
  [Al-Salih] What will the alliance's position be if 
tomorrow's meeting fails? 
  [Mustafa] We would continue the dialogue. But in the end we 
would return to our previous situation, that is 10 factions. 
  [Al-Salih] The PFLP and the DFLP say there are two 
tendencies inside Hamas: One represented by Musa Abu-Rizq, head 
of the movement's Political Bureau, and calling for 
consolidating the alliance with the opposition factions in order 
to thwart the Palestinian-Israeli agreement; and another 
represented by Ibrahim Ghawshah, the official spokesman, and 
banking on dialogue with Israel and improving relations with the 
United States. What is your opinion? 
  [Mustafa] Actually there are no tendencies in Hamas, but, 
rather, various views presented to its leading and shura 
[consultative] committees in order to adopt the right view after 
studying all possibilities. So the minority complies with the 
majority's view after being convinced that the latter is right. 
  As for the talk about a disagreement and the existence of 
two 
tendencies, it is absolutely groundless. Brothers Ghawshah and 
Nazzal respect the opinion of brother Musa Abu-Rizq, who in turn 
respects their composure and views. 
  With regard to the dialogue with Israel, it is rejected 
right 
from the grass roots to the leadership. As for the dialogue 
with the United States, it is not rejected by anyone, so we 
cannot say that some people are against or for it. 
  [Al-Salih] It is also said that there is a tendency 
espousing the Iranian position calling for action to topple the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement by any means, and another tendency 
which believes that the agreement is going to collapse anyway so 
there is no need to embark on any action that is bound to weaken 
Hamas' position among the masses. 
  [Mustafa] Hamas with all its leaders and grass roots is 
against the agreement and it is working with all its strength to 
topple it. But at the same time we are eager not to reach the 
point of Palestinian infighting. 
  With regard to Iran, we join anyone seeking to confront this 
scheme and anyone who is working for the sake of Palestine and 
its liberation. We are hostile toward no one, nor do we impose 
our views on anyone. Thus the brothers in Iran have requested 
nothing of that kind from us. We are eager to maintain balanced 
relations with everyone on the Arab and Islamic scenes, and we 
refuse to be linked to any quarter. 
  [Al-Salih] Are there behind-the-scene mediation efforts to 
bring your and 'Arafat's views closer, as reported? 
  [Mustafa] I have no knowledge of such mediations. We are 
against 'Arafat's method, including the agreement. 
  [Al-Salih] What truth is there in reports that meetings were 
held between the Israelis and imprisoned Hamas leaders? 
  [Mustafa] No meetings in the real sense were held. All 
that happened is that brother 'Imad al-Faluji (serving a life 
sentence), and he is a Hamas leader, was summoned to a dialogue. 
The Israelis raised with him the question of suspending military 
action. For his part, 'Imad informed them of his inability to 
make any decision in this connection. So they offered to 
release him in return for discussing this issue with Hamas 
leaders outside. But he rejected this proposal, stressing that 
these matters do not fall within his powers. 
  In this connection I would like to stress that the statement 
attributed to Hamas and which implies willingness to cease 
military attacks in return for [the fulfillment of] some 
conditions is untrue and designed to cause confusion on the 
Palestinian scene.

<F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>
  [Text] During the past two days, the Islamic Resistance 
Movement, Hamas, has come under scathing attack by some members 
of the 10-faction alliance for demanding 40 percent of the 
membership in the alliance of Palestinian forces, which is the 
latest approved name for this alliance. 
  Some observers commented on this verbal dual that was 
conducted through the media by asking: Is Hamas equal to those 
factions that do not have a presence inside the occupied 
homeland? 
  Some officials in these factions leveled a number of 
accusations against Hamas and said that it is seeking to 
obstruct the march of the alliance and is backing out on what 
was previously agreed. However, in statements to AL-DUSTUR, 
Hamas official spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah said: We are going to 
Damascus today, Thursday, to discuss together the organizational 
formula of the alliance after agreement has been reached on the 
name of this alliance; that is, the alliance of Palestinian 
forces. We presented our view so that there would be guarantees 
for the march of the alliance and a translation of its 
resolutions on the ground and so that this march would have 
credibility in representing the participating factions. 
  He noted: The leadership of the alliance should be more 
realistic in evaluating the effective forces in the Palestinian 
arena. Hamas has highlighted the daily facts of its developing 
strength through its struggle, intifadah activities, as well as 
professional union elections inside the occupied territories. 
Our weight exceeded the quota demanded at the Palestine 
National Council [PNC] in spring 1990. 
  Ghawshah added: Our demands for 40 percent of the alliance 
membership is reasonable. We do not think we provoked any other 
faction when we presented a draft demanding 40 percent of the 
membership for Hamas, 40 percent for the other factions, and 20 
percent for the independents. It is well known that this 
alliance is a temporary leadership for the Palestinian people at 
this critical stage -- a leadership that adheres to the 
constants of these people, taking into consideration that the 
permanent leadership is the one that will be elected by the 
Palestinian people inside the occupied territories and in the 
diaspora in free and honest elections. 
  Ghawshah went on to say: Hamas considers the local national 
conferences and the comprehensive national conference as 
political and media forums to announce the political program and 
organizational formula to be approved. This conference does not 
have any organizational authority. Therefore, it is logical to 
say that whatever the 10 ten factions agree on is considered a 
final agreement. Hamas understands that the purpose of the 
national congress is to inform and bless the temporary 
leadership. 
  This understanding is important because there are some 
factions that are trying to make the national conferences, 
including the general congress, an organizational tool that 
replaces the PNC. Hamas rejects this, in part and parcel. 
  Asked about accusations by some factions that Hamas is 
retreating, Ghawshah said: We did not change our policy, 
method, or principle. We adhere to the clear Islamic principles 
of the Palestinian issue. It is a united trend unlike what some 
of the 10 factions claim. 
  He said: Our stand toward the Zionist enemy did not change. 
Our rejection of the Zionist enemy is a principled rejection 
since it occupies and colonizes an Islamic Arab territory. 
There can be no dialogue, negotiations, or reconciliation with 
this usurper. Moreover, there can be no agreement on decisions 
that diminish the rights of the Palestinian people. 
  Ghawshah added: Hamas was surprised by some attacks that are 
unjustified, unless someone wanted to impose their presence by 
using loud voices instead of offering the blood of martyrs and 
taking part in our people's intifadah inside the occupied 
territories. 
  He said: These loud voices will never affect the course of 
our movement. We believe that if the alliance is to become a 
reality on the ground, then the other Palestinian opposition 
forces, who are dear to us, must deal with the facts that are as 
clear as the sun. The Islamic trend inside and outside Palestine 
has become tangible and no one can ignore it except those who 
want to ignore the light of the sun. 
  Ghawshah continued: As long as there is an objective 
handling of issues, then it will be possible to reach a unifying 
formula that will unite all the factions. 
  Asked about Hamas' stand in case the other factions reject 
its demands dealing with representation, Ghawshah said: I 
believe that the brothers in the factions will conduct a totally 
objective and reasonable examination of our demands. We hope we 
will reach an agreement on fighting the Zionist occupation, 
standing against the Gaza-Jericho First conspiracy, and 
reinforcing and continuing the intifadah. 
  He added: We sincerely and strongly hope to develop the 10 
factions into a temporary leadership for the Palestinian people 
so that action would be more effective and so that the people's 
sympathy with us would be clearer. If the formula of the 
alliance of Palestinian forces does not succeed, then we shall 
continue with that formula until we arrive at circumstances that 
will allow for more sincere unification. 
  As for what is being said about contacts between Hamas and 
Israel during the truce which ended last Sunday, Ghawshah said: 
There are trends that are fishing in murky waters and 
exploiting the ability of the Zionist enemy and some Arab 
parties, represented at the Knesset, that have access to Shaykh 
Ahmad Yasin or other Hamas detainees, and report inaccurate 
statements by Shaykh Yasin that are not scrutinized. 
  He added: Contacts between some Israeli officials and Hamas 
detainees cannot in anyway be be termed as dialogue. Dialogue 
is only held between free people and not between the prisoner 
and the prison warden or between one who has the power and one 
who is detained. Hamas will never hold any dialogue with the 
Zionists. 
  He continued: Through the deputy chief of staff and Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres, the Zionist enemy rejected the truce 
proposed by Hamas. Peres accused Hamas of seeking Israeli 
capitulation. Hence, Hamas has a broad field in which to 
continue confronting the soldiers and settlers of the Zionist 
occupation.

<F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>
  [Excerpt] Information from Damascus indicates that the 
meeting of the 10 Palestinian factions, "the alliance of 
Palestinian forces," has failed. According to the information, 
the major issues of interest have been delayed for 10 days until 
representatives of the alliance recalculate and rethink their 
positions. 
  Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for the Islamic 
Resistance Movement, Hamas, thinks otherwise. He said the above 
information is not precise. The Damascus meeting was 
successful. It overcame several obstacles and enhanced mutual 
trust between the 10 factions. 
  In a statement to AL-DUSTUR, Ghawshah said: It has been 
agreed to stop media criticism between some factions and to 
settle any disputes through bilateral and general meetings 
between the representatives of the factions. It has also been 
decided to set up a technical committee to study the fact that 
several parties have been claiming credit for any single jihad 
operation in Palestine. 
  Ghawshah added: More important than all of this was debating 
the organizational formula for which the important meeting was 
devoted, as well as endorsing a political program and naming the 
alliance of Palestinian forces. 
  He said: Delaying the meeting for five days and Hamas' draft 
for an organizational formula has somewhat beclouded the future 
of the 10 factions. However, it was explained to the brothers 
that delaying the meeting was for technical reasons and that the 
proposed formula has been studied and adopted by the movement's 
leadership and has its justifications. 
  Answering a question, he said: The two points raised by the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine on 25 October 1993 were 
settled in the last meeting and a political program was finally 
adopted by all the factions. [passage omitted] 
  Ghawshah said the political program emphasizes that the 
basic 
arena for jihad is inside the occupied territories. The program 
eventually aims at reconstruction PLO institutions on democratic 
bases.

  [Text] The Palestine National Liberation Movement, Fatah, 
the General Command of the al-'Asifah Forces [Fatah-the 
Uprising], has issued a military statement, saying: 
  To uphold our faith in armed struggle as the major course to 
be taken to liberate the entire Palestinian national soil, the 
heroic al-'Asifah revolutionaries affiliated with the group of 
heroic martyr Abu-'Ali Mahdi crossed into Palestine last night, 
determined to keep the revolution going until victory, even if 
they had to meet death. They managed to cross what the enemy 
and its agents call the border strip in southern Lebanon as well 
as the enemy's security fences. They arrived in northern 
Palestine and the Dan area and clashed with a mechanized 
military patrol in Upper Galilee in a heroic and daring 
operation that continued from 0300 to 0430 on 30 December 1993. 
They destroyed an enemy military vehicle, killing or wounding 
some of its occupants. This forced the enemy to use a large 
number of its troops as well as airborne paratroopers in the 
operation. 
  The statement issued by the Fatah Movement, the General 
Command of the al-'Asifah Forces, added: The enemy has admitted 
that the operation took place, acknowledged that it suffered 
some casualties, and attempted to minimize its losses, as usual. 
However, it has repeatedly said through its news media that it 
is the first operation of its kind for a long time in which our 
heroes have managed to breach the Zionist entity's security 
fences. 
  During the heroic clash with the enemy, three fedayeen were 
martyred. They are the following: Patrol commander heroic 
martyr Lieutenant Ahmad Amin Qa'qur, born in 1971, Amman, he 
hailed from Tarqumiyah, Hebron; heroic martyr 1st Sergeant 
Ashraf Hammad Mansur, born in 1970, Dar'a, he hailed from 
Beersheba; and heroic martyr 1st Sergeant Ahmad Rafiq al-Mallah, 
born in 1973, Nahr al-Barid, he hailed from 'Illar, Tulkarm.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Shlomi Eldar] </F>
  [Excerpts] Fatah members are continuing celebrations 
marking the anniversary of the organization's establishment, 
which falls on Saturday [1 January]. The Fatah Hawks held a 
procession in the al-Shati' refugee camp and fired weapons in 
the air. Earlier, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] issued 
its own congratulations to Fatah. 
  [Begin recording] [Eldar] For the first time since the 
establishment of Fatah in the Gaza Strip 29 years ago, the 
organization's anniversary celebrations are designed to prove 
its strength and size. This is the first time that the 
organization is celebrating as a future establishment body and 
not as an underground movement. Nevertheless, the festivities 
are taking place under the shadow of a crisis. Fatah is finding 
it difficult to make the transformation from an underground 
terrorist organization to a body that is recognized as the 
legitimate authority in the Palestinian autonomy. The struggles 
at the top are greatly undermining Fatah's activity in the 
Palestinian street. Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, the former head 
of the Palestinian delegation, who is considered an opponent of 
the Declaration of Principles, said that anyone wanting to 
celebrate today, still had some waiting to do. [passage omitted] 
  Isma'il Haniyah, a returned Hamas deportee, was among the 
well wishers in the crowd. He came to congratulate Fatah on 
behalf of Hamas and to express solidarity. Fatah, Haniyah said, 
was the first to fire the guns of the struggle. People in the 
audience noted that Haniyah's participation was an indication of 
the desire by Hamas to be integrated in the autonomy's founding 
institutions. 
  Tomorrow afternoon, Gaza city will host the main rally, in 
which approximately 20,000 people are expected to take part. 
This will hopefully prove that the Fatah is still in control of 
the Gaza Strip. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein and 'Amira Hess] </F>
  [Excerpt] Yesterday, Fatah announced the establishment of a 
branch of Force-17 in the territories. The declaration was made 
in a leaflet disseminated in Hebron to mark the 29th anniversary 
of the establishment of Fatah -- 1 January. 
  The establishment of "the militia of Force-17 at this time 
is 
part of a well-defined work plan," the leaflet notes, "and is 
not an attempt to jump the leading wagon or ask for power or 
leadership positions -- as some believe. We chose this date to 
make the declaration in order to express our adherence to and 
confidence in all branches of the Palestinian leadership. We 
will use our full force to serve the leadership and provide our 
people with stability and security. We renew our pledge of 
allegiance to the Palestinian revolution." 
  The authors of the leaflet further explain that Force-17 in 
the territories will be a pillar of support for "the best men of 
our nation." In the past, the force served as Yasir 'Arafat's 
personal guard, but later on 'Arafat distanced himself from the 
members of the force. The leaflet promises that "today, we 
begin our journey for the construction of security for our 
Palestinian nation." 
  Palestinian sources have estimated that behind the leaflet 
are hawkish Fatah elements which are not pleased with the 
decision to end terror attacks against Israeli targets, 
especially after the settlers' riots and the freeze in the 
negotiations. 
  According to the sources, another possibility is that the 
Fatah central leadership wishes to demonstrate determined 
presence in view of the eroding support for Fatah among the 
residents of the territories. Fatah also wishes to prove to 
Israel that, should the negotiations with Israel fail, its 
leadership has other options. About a month ago, Fatah Hawks 
squads were set up in Hebron. Unlike the original squads in 
Gaza, the Fatah Hawks in Hebron are not made of armed fugitives, 
but of activists of the al-Shabiba youth movement. The fact 
that Fatah Hawks squads, and now Force-17, were established in 
this region indicates a radicalization of Fatah in the Hebron 
region, mainly in view of exacerbating confrontations with the 
city's settlers. 
  Another leaflet Fatah disseminated yesterday to mark the 
anniversary of its establishment says that the struggle must 
continue in all forms -- on the battlefield and at the 
negotiating table. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Said Saadi, secretary general of the Rally </F>
for Culture and Democracy in Algeria, by correspondent Muriel 
Pomponne; date and place not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Our guest this evening in the second part of 
Afrique Soir is Said Saadi, the secretary general of the Rally 
for Culture and Democracy [RCD], in Algeria. Said Saadi has 
recently set up a new movement, the Movement for the Republic 
[Mouvement pour la Republique] in order to advocate an ideal 
that is different from that of the Islamists. [passage omitted] 
  [Pomponne] You are a priori rather against a dialogue with 
Islamists who are said to be moderate. 
  [Saadi] I do not know many. Those said to be moderate have 
aligned themselves with the stance of the extremists; it is a 
movement of extremists that falls within the framework of 
violence and is a movement that necessarily tends toward 
one-upmanship. Anyone who wants to be relatively moderate is 
condemned by the very dynamism of this movement. Kebir, who was 
said to be the soft version of the fundamentalist movement has 
recently been obliged to join the stances of armed groups in 
order to stay in the race. It is not I who reject the debate, 
unfortunately it is the fundamentalists, who, for the moment, 
slit throats and kill, and it is the only form of communication 
they choose to address the people. It cuts short any form of 
speculation. Dialogue is a will to respect the life of others 
first and their ideas second. This has never been the intention 
of fundamentalists. 
  [Pomponne] Is this the way you analyze, for instance, the 
communique published by the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] 
recently, which advocates the continuation of the armed struggle? 
  [Saadi] This communique has only one interest: It is the 
first time that the FIS, which was said to be a political 
organization, that up to now has not followed armed action and 
acts of violence in general, has ended up by advocating this 
bloody demonstration that it has imposed on the country. I 
personally have never believed in the slightest possibility of 
an organized evolution of the FIS, even as political 
authorities. I was often in prison with them, I know all their 
officials, and I know exactly what they are planning to do. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Pomponne] You said that you think that the Army could play 
a 
more important role. According to you, what is the role it must 
and can play? 
  [Saadi] I have not said that the Army could play a more 
important role. The Army already plays an important role and 
has been doing so since 1962, the date of independence. I say 
that I did not know whether the Army could now adapt to change 
well, when the matter is not simply a military operation. The 
Algerian crisis is not military but is above all political. 
Will the Army take the positions it should in very complicated 
situations? Will it handle the current situation; knowing that 
up to now it has already found people who use it as a front, as 
a political shop window, while keeping power. I do not think 
that this scenario is now possible. 
  [Pomponne] What do you want it to do? 
  [Saadi] That the Army remains a republican institution that 
shoulders completely the republican state whose institutions it 
has the duty to defend and not to make.

  [Excerpt] Sources of the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front 
and citizens in Algiers who were contacted by AL-HAYAH over the 
telephone confirmed that the front began television transmission 
last Monday [27 December] under the name of Salvation 
Television, which was monitored in the capital. 
  By this, the front is adding clandestine television 
transmission to its radio transmission named al-Wafa' Radio, 
which regularly transmits every Saturday from an unknown place.

  [Text] In a statement to AL-MUJAHID today, Rezzaq Bara, 
chairman of the National Human Rights Monitoring Group, 
indicated that about 780 Islamists were still in detention at 
the Oued Namous center in Bechar and the In Amguel center in 
Tamanrasset. He promised that efforts would continue to obtain 
the closure of these two centers. Bara said that the 
implementation of the anti-terrorism law had led to abuse in 
some cases, especially with regard to the way in which searches 
were conducted and the failure of the authorities to respect the 
duration of preventive detention, which does not exceed 12 days 
according to the anti-terrorism law. 
  The chairman of the National Human Rights Monitoring Group 
did not conceal the fact that there were abuses and a number of 
suspicious deaths. According to him, the monitoring group had 
asked for judicial inquiries to be opened in this regard. 
  On the question of torture, which the monitoring group 
condemns, Bara stressed that no incriminating complaints had 
been made to the judicial authorities, which would have made it 
possible to open a judicial inquiry against those accused of 
practicing torture. He said that the only thing in this respect 
was that about 12 complaints of ill treatment had been recorded. 
Judicial inquiries had been opened on these issues and those 
against whom the accusations had been proven had been punished. 
  Bara said that the detainees he had mentioned were those 
remaining from an original total of 9,000 detainees who had been 
sent to seven different security centers last March.

  [Text] The Algerian General Workers Union [UGTA] rejected 
any agreement, in whatever form, that seeks to reschedule 
Algerian debts. This is what UGTA Secretary General Abdelhak 
Benhamouda was saying. 
  In a statement published in yesterday's issue of the 
newspaper EL-MASSA, Benhamouda said that an agreement in the 
aforementioned field will turn the IMF into a gendarme in 
Algeria. 
  The UGTA secretary general explained that talks on the 
question of the debts should be assigned to an Algerian 
negotiator who has the backing of the people. 
  Benhamouda also pointed out that workers are not the only 
ones to be blamed for the state of complacency that one sees in 
the national enterprises. He called for work to be valued by 
practical and material encouragement and that the law must be 
respected by everyone.

  [Text] Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, 
has said that there is nothing called a Cairo document, a 
document the Israelis demanded be a basis for resuming 
negotiations. He described the Israelis as liars and said: I 
know and Egypt knows that the Israelis presented forged maps 
during the Taba talks. 
  Qaddumi noted that one of the reasons he expressed 
reservations over the Declaration of Principle is his confidence 
that Israel would not carry out its promises, as he put it. 
  Qaddumi was talking to reporters upon arrival in Cairo last 
night. Qaddumi will meet with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa today 
and then leave for Amman tomorrow to resume coordination with 
Jordan in view of King Husayn's statement in which he clearly 
voiced resentment over the absence of serious coordination. 
  Within this context, Qaddumi regarded talk about a 
Jordanian-Palestinian confederation to be premature. Discussing 
this at present would complicate matters, as he put it. 
  It is worth mentioning that King Husayn has recently said 
that he has asked Yasir 'Arafat to drop the word confederation 
from his lexicon.

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Jan (MENA)--AL-JUMHURIYAH affirms that 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa's visit to Jordan is linked to the 
comprehensive peace process in the Middle East and its 
developments. The visit, it adds, comes within the context of 
Egypt's continuous efforts for peace and security in the Arab 
region in the eastern Mediterranean and its eagerness to defuse 
inter-Arab differences. 
  In its editorial today, Tuesday, the paper says that Musa's 
hope for more open Arab relations in 1994 stems from Egypt's 
belief in the unity and harmony of Arab interests. It notes 
that Egypt is conducting preventive diplomacy at the Arab level 
in general and at the Jordanian-Palestinian level in particular. 
  The paper explains that Egypt is always open to Arab 
cooperation within the context of mutual respect and 
nonintervention in internal affairs. It affirms that 
negotiations on peace in the eastern Mediterranean requires the 
Arabs to maintain unity. 
  The paper says everyone must realize that Arab 
reconciliation 
at this time is vital to achieving a just and comprehensive 
peace and that this goes beyond the post-peace phase to building 
modern Arab economic resources.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahim 'Ali] </F>
  [Text] With the beginning of the new year, the Interior 
Ministry is preparing a major reshuffle of its apparatuses in 
Asyut Governorate. The reshuffle will involve 90 percent of the 
officers and undercover detectives in the State Security and 
Criminal Investigation Departments. The changes were approved 
after it was confirmed that terrorists know the names of most of 
the police officers operating in Asyut and can identify them. 
  The changes will be made in light of a new security strategy 
to confront terrorism. It involves staging intensive mobile 
patrols and fixed and mobile ambushes throughout the governorate 
and reinforcing the undercover police presence in the streets of 
the city of Asyut. 
  The new plan will change the locations of fixed civilian 
police ambushes. One plainclothes policeman will stand guard in 
front of the target that is being protected, while the other 
members of the ambush team will scatter over a 10-meter distance 
around the target so that they will not be easily hunted, like 
the victims of the recent terrorist attack were. 
  This plan was being developed at the same time that a large 
number of officers from the criminal investigation and special 
operation departments from the various governorates were 
arriving in Asyut. 
  In reaction to these security measures to crack down on the 
terrorist dens and the terrorist leaders, the Islamic Group in 
Upper Egypt has proclaimed its defiance, claiming that it has a 
strategy to confront them.

  [Text] Cairo, 2 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Kamal al-Janzuri, deputy 
prime minister and minister of planning, has affirmed that the 
state is aware of all the challenges noted in President Husni 
Mubarak's speech before the joint session of the People's 
Assembly and Consultative Council on Thursday, 11 November, on 
the occasion of the beginning of the new parliamentary round. 
  The Consultative Council, under the chairmanship of 
Consultative Council Speaker Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi, today met 
to discuss the report by the committee formed to respond to the 
president's statement. Dr. al-Janzuri spoke to the Consultative 
Council in today's session. He said that the government was not 
surprised by these challenges and has known where it was heading 
ever since it set the 20-year plan and reached the stage of 
economic and financial reform control, and embarked on trying to 
confront all the challenges mentioned by the president in his 
statement. 
  Dr. al-Janzuri clarified that by introducing production we 
will manage to confront the problems of unemployment, slum 
areas, and bureaucracy. He noted that without culture and 
education, we cannot begin to confront these challenges. He 
pointed out that in the 1993/1994 plan, an investment of 1.6 
billion Egyptian pounds will be allocated to education, because 
we cannot launch any reform projects without good education. 
Dr. Kamal al-Janzuri affirmed that security and stability 
cannot be realized while slum areas continue to exist in 11 
governorates, specifically in 434 locations. He noted that the 
initial estimates for improving these areas amount to around 4 
billion pounds. He said that some projects for the 
infrastructure have been set for southern Egypt, most important 
of which is the dual railway line to Aswan. He said that the 
infrastructure projects have a social dimension too. 
  He said that the 1994/95 plan will include a new vision of 
production performance to avert the dangers coming from the GATT 
agreement. He noted that Egypt imports foodstuffs amounting to 
$3 billion a year and that after removing subsidies and without 
the duty on food exports, this number will double. 
  He added that 1.6 million feddans of land cannot be 
allocated 
for fruits and vegetables at a time when half this land can be 
allocated for planting oil seeds or sugar products. He noted 
that Egypt imports edible oils amounting to around $0.5 billion 
in addition to $700 million for the importation of sugar from 
abroad. 
  Dr. al-Janzuri noted the regional challenges involved in the 
Middle-Eastern market, saying that the achievement we aspire to 
must pass through an inter-Arab dialogue before initiating an 
Arab-Israeli one. 
  The deputy prime minister noted that inter-Arab trade does 
not exceed five percent, while Arab trade with the West is 95 
percent. He noted also that Arab investments in Arab territories 
do not go beyond five percent, while they reach 85 percent in 
non-Arab territories. He pointed out that facing up to these 
challenges requires Arab cohesion. The Arab common market 
started simultaneously with the EC, but we Arabs did not achieve 
what we hoped to achieve, he said. 
  Dr. al-Janzuri added that the Egyptian people will witness a 
breakthrough in production, less reliance on imports, and more 
employment of their labor force in the upcoming three years of 
[words indistinct]. This will further consolidate security and 
stability, he said.

  [Text] Tripoli, al-Kanun [Dec] 31, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY 
-- The former head of American intelligence, (CIA), William 
Webster has said that the accusation made against nationals from 
the Great Jamahiriya implicating them in the downing of a Pan Am 
airline, stems from political intentions which are related to 
the so-called `peace' process and the attempt to gain allies in 
the gulf war. 
  The American roving ambassador for anti terrorism affairs 
during Bush's term, Jerry Braemer, gave press statements saying 
that the levelling of accusations against Libya was related to 
the so-called `requirements' of the peace process in the Middle 
East and the issue of Western hostages held in Lebanon. 
  John Murphy, a relative of one of the victims of the Pan Am 
American airliner said that the families of the victims of the 
plane were smelling something fishy emanating from this 
turnabout in the case against Libya.

was not notified as to any decision to cancel the result of 
elections in any constituency and was not informed by any side

  The press service at the elections and census department was 
reacting to some news reports that parliamentary by-elections 
should be held in some constituencies of which the judiciary 
authorities annulled the results. In this regard, the source 
underlines the government's commitment to organize in due time 
by-elections as soon as it receives judiciary decisions from the 
Supreme Court's constitutional chamber.

<F P=106> [Muhammad Sa'id al-Hasan report on interview with Dr. Ghazi </F>
Salah-al-Din, Sudanese minister of state for presidential 
affairs, in London; date not given] 
  [Text] Dr. Ghazi Salah-al-Din, Sudan's minister of state 
for presidential affairs, has revealed that his country has 
informed the presidents of the IGADD [Intergovernmental 
Authority on Drought and Development] states (Kenya, Uganda, 
Eritrea, and Ethiopia) that "hostile quarters" are making moves 
to prevent the Garang movement from negotiating with Khartoum. 
  In an interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Salah-al-Din accused 
the Garang movement of turning into a separatist movement. In 
this connection he cited the Washington seminar held in October, 
which resulted in an agreement between the two wings of the 
Sudanese People's Liberation Movement on the demand for 
self-determination. 
  Salah-al-Din added that Sudanese President Lieutenant 
General 
'Umar al-Bashir had told leaders of the IGADD states that, 
despite his government's commitment to finding a peaceful 
solution to the southern Sudan problem, "there can be no talk of 
favorable conditions for peace talks in light of the rebel 
factions' adherence to the Washington document. Because it is a 
hostile document talking about pooling efforts not for the sake 
of peace, but for the sake of resisting the government and 
fighting it in the north. It also mentions the south's 
separation from the north, especially as this document assumes 
importance through a document backed by the United States, as 
the U.S. Administration participated in all debates and 
discussions between the two rebel factions, sometimes at the 
highest level and in the presence of U.S. Assistant Secretary of 
State George Moose. Besides, some of the two rebel factions' 
meetings were held inside the U.S. Department of State premises." 
  Asked about the chances of success for any future 
negotiations between the government and the Garang movement, 
Salah-al-Din said: "We believe that the factors pushing the 
peace process forward are stronger than the factors delaying 
peace, and that external factors are strong. 
  "At present peace prospects are better than before. First, 
because of all the parties' strong conviction. Second, because 
the rebels' dreams of liberating Sudan and establishing their 
imaginary state have collapsed." 
  Asked whether the government had proof of foreign 
intervention to obstruct peace efforts in southern Sudan, he 
said: We have clear evidence and proof. If we take the 
Washington seminar as an example, we will realize that the 
Washington document is hostile and conspiratorial toward Sudan. 
However, it has succeeded in one thing, namely shaking the 
cohesion of the so-called national [opposition] alliance or 
grouping. Immediately after the Washington seminar we saw that 
there were conflicting interpretations of the Washington 
document from the grouping's leaders. I also believe that the 
seminar has succeeded in sowing the seeds of suspicion and 
spreading confusion inside this group. 
  On the statement issued by the United States and in which it 
denied its intervention at official level in the Washington 
seminar, saying that it favors a cease-fire in order to 
alleviate the suffering in the south, Dr. Ghazi Salah-al-Din 
said: "We have been accustomed to the clarification of U.S. 
positions recently. In anything, it proves the confusion in U.S. 
foreign policy, not only with regard to Sudan, but to Somalia, 
Bosnia, and others as well. Our reply to these statements is 
that the attempt to give the impression that the U.S. Congress 
operates in complete isolation from the U.S. Administration is 
merely a U.S. theatrical show which cannot fool anyone. We know 
that Congress derives its stands and views from U.S. Department 
of State reports. This separation among U.S. institutions is 
designed to fool the simple and naive, but this trick cannot 
fool people." 
  He pointed out that the U.S. Administration had 
acknowledged that a representative of the U.S. Department of 
State had attended all negotiation sessions between the two 
factions of the Garang movement in Washington. And that Reik 
Mashar, leader of one of the two factions, issued a statement on 
the circumstances surrounding the nonsigning of the document, in 
which he said that a meeting was held in the U.S. Department of 
State premises on 22 October 1993 to persuade the two sides to 
sign the document. Salah-al-Din said that all this proves "the 
U.S. Department of State's involvement in the seminar and its 
results." 
  He added: "We believe that it is more useful for the U.S. 
Administration to correct its intentions and actions toward 
Sudan, because the march of history is stronger than us all." 
  On Sudanese-Egyptian relations, Salah-al-Din pointed to the 
distinctiveness of these relations. He said that "Sudan has 
spared no efforts to talk about this special characteristic. 
And when we talk about this special characteristic, we mean the 
inevitable improvement in relations with regard to the final 
outcome, regardless of the side effects here or there. It is 
known that a meeting was held between President Lt. Gen. 'Umar 
al-Bashir and President Husni Mubarak, during which they reached 
agreements, some of which have been implemented. The 
implementation of the other agreements has been delayed, but not 
because of us. This includes a meeting between the two foreign 
ministers in Sudan. It has been postponed three times, and we 
hope it will take place because, for our part, we have never 
hesitated to express good intentions. Over a period of a few 
months our foreign minister visited Cairo five times. And Lt. 
Gen. 'Umar al-Bashir too visited Cairo, and his deputy Major 
General al-Zubayr Muhammad Salih visited Cairo twice last year. 
This alone is sufficient to prove our intentions. And recently 
cordial statements were made by Egyptian officials regarding the 
Washington document, proving the Egyptian Government's interest 
in Sudanese territorial integrity -- which is good and positive. 
But we need more goodwill assurances vis-a-vis the Hala'ib 
issue, because the good statements concerning the Washington 
seminar tend to coincide with worrying statements on Hala'ib and 
its annexation as an electoral constituency and the 
establishment of construction projects in it." 
  As for relations with Libya, Salah-al-Din admitted that "the 
integration process has been hampered by some events and 
developments, not on our part or that of the jamahiriyah, but on 
the part of Western states which were unhappy to see a sensible 
experiment not based on slogans but, rather, on practical 
foundations. So they declared their embargo against the 
jamahiriyah, and they are toughening this embargo -- which has 
affected Libya's and Sudan's ability to communicate, even though 
our contacts with the brothers in Libya and the attempts to 
advance relations with it have not been interrupted. 
  And in this context, President al-Bashir visited Libya after 
the embargo was imposed, crossing deserts and seas. And Maj. 
Gen. al-Zubayr visited Libya twice. And the ministerial 
committee headed by Cabinet Affairs Minister Dr. 'Awad al-Jaz 
went to the joint ministerial committee's meetings in October.

Paris-Dakar-Paris rally passing through the Western Sahara. 
While initially the organizers of the rally turned a deaf ear 
to the warnings, and it was even said that there was no kind of 
threat, stark reality has drawn their attention to what is no 
longer either a threat or a warning, but rather a serious and 
firm declaration that cannot be shrugged off, a declaration such 
as that made in Granada by Tahar Sidi, spokesman for the 
Polisario Front in Andalusia: 
  [Begin Sidi recording] The Polisario Front's stance is 
clear. 
In our opinion, it is a violation of the cease-fire. In our 
opinion, it is a territory of the utmost risk and no one can

trucks, and hundreds and hundreds of people." [end recording]

  [Text] This morning, Foreign Minister Habib Ben Yahya, had 
a conversation with his Spanish counterpart at the ministry's 
headquarters. 
  Following the conversation, the two ministers chaired a 
working session attended by the delegations of the two countries 
as well as the Tunisian ambassador to Spain and the Spanish 
ambassador to Tunisia. 
  In a statement to the Tunisie Afrique Presse, the Spanish 
foreign minister described relations between the two countries 
as distinguished. He explained that the talks centered around 
bilateral issues and other questions of mutual concern and 
dealing with Europe and the Mediterranean. 
  Mr. Solana expressed his satisfaction with the closeness of 
the viewpoints of the two countries and also the closeness of 
their views on the questions that had been raised. 
  The Spanish foreign minister added that the prospects for 
Tunisian-Spanish cooperation were very good whether in the 
economic or the political fields. He noted that some practical 
proposals were put forward which concerned trade relations and 
partnership between the two countries. 
  [Later in the same newscast, the radio reports that talks 
took place this afternoon at the Interior Ministry between 
Tunisian Interior Minister Abdallah Kallel and Solana, as well 
as the Spanish ambassador to Tunisia. "During the meeting the 
two ministers reviewed the various aspects of Tunisian-Spanish 
relations, particularly after the visit of His Excellency 
President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to Spain, which opened up 
numerous fields for strengthening the ties of understanding and 
closer links between the two friendly countries." The 
conversation also touched on "a number of issues of mutual 
interest in the security and development fields and the 
prospects for strengthening bilateral cooperation and the means 
necessary to further promote and develop this cooperation for 
the benefit of joint Tunisian-Spanish interests." 
  [The radio also reports Solana was received by Chedli 
Neffati, general secretary of the Democratic Constitutional 
Assembly, RCD. During this meeting, "a review took place of the 
excellent relations between the two friendly countries and the 
prospects of consolidating and promoting them for the benefit of 
the Tunisian and Spanish peoples." Neffati "pointed out the 
distinguished role of the RCD in the national arena and the 
development drive." The meeting also "dealt with the relations 
between the RCD and the Spanish Socialist Workers Party and ways 
of developing and consolidating them."]

  [Text] Tunisia has expressed its satisfaction in a 
statement issued by the Foreign Ministry after the South African 
parliament's approval of the interim constitution calling for 
the equality of all citizens in South Africa without 
discrimination by color or race. 
  It stressed that this new gain constitutes without any doubt 
new mortar in the building of a free and just society. It is 
also a sign indicating that the democratic process of this 
fraternal country is an irrevocable choice. 
  While Tunisia values the courage of the presidents, Mandela 
and De Klerk, and their foresight, it expresses hope that the 
multi-racial elections scheduled to take place in April 1994 
will bring about a democratic non-racial state under a unified 
structure with all its capabilities.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has again indicated 
that the Taba negotiations with the Palestinians can be resumed 
only on the basis of the Cairo understandings. At a news 
conference in Jerusalem, Peres said the Cairo document was 
agreed upon by both sides, and if the PLO rejects it, it must 
clarify on what basis the talks can continue. Peres was 
speaking at a news conference with visiting British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd. Jack Katzenell reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Foreign Minister Peres 
rejected Yasir 'Arafat's charge that Israel is trying to 
humiliate the Palestinians. We respect the Palestinian 
leadership and opposition, Peres said, but he insisted that 
there was a meeting of minds in Cairo on all the major issues, 
and this, he said, is what the document reflects. 
  [Peres] I didn't say that they have automatically to accept 
it, but if they reject it, they have to ask themselves: What 
will be the basis of negotiations? Why do they negotiate? And 
what they have rejected are points that we have agreed upon. 
  [Katzenell] Peres said the Gaza and Jericho arrangement 
which Israel is offering the Palestinians will not be a 
Bandustan, as Yasir 'Arafat has charged, since it will not be 
the end of the story. On the contrary, in a few months Israel 
will begin negotiations on extending the autonomy to the rest of 
the territories, Peres said. 
  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had talks with Peres 
for about an hour this morning. Hurd said Britain has a 
passionate interest in the success of the negotiations between 
Israel and the PLO. It is not easy to reconcile Palestinian 
dignity with Israeli security, Hurd conceded. 
  [Hurd] So I do not think it is surprising that there are 
difficulties and setbacks. I just feel, as an outsider and 
well-wisher, that all those concerned are perhaps in the middle 
of a river, but they have passed the point where it is easier to 
go back then to go forward. It is actually rather easier to go 
forward -- although difficult -- than to go back and start all 
over again. I am sure that is perceived here; I hope it is also 
perceived by the PLO. 
  [Katzenell] Douglas Hurd said Israel took a courageous and 
difficult step when it signed the Declaration of Principles and 
recognized the PLO. He would recommend the most liberal terms 
possible for Israel when it negotiates its new economic 
agreement with the EC. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has assured the PLO 
that it will have the opportunity to again raise demands now 
being rejected by Israel in the Gaza-Jericho First negotiations. 
The foreign minister is urging the Palestinians to allow 
implementation of self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho and to 
put off their demands that have stalled the talks until 
negotiations begin on the fate of the rest of the West Bank. 
David Ze'ev reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] Contacts between Israel and the 
PLO can happen at any moment these days, including twice by 
phone as Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was briefing the Knesset 
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Palestinian negotiator 
Nabil Sha'th was on the other end. A Knesset official at the 
closed-door committee meeting referred to the second phone 
conversation as relatively long, lasting several minutes. 
Members of the media followed Peres when he slipped into a side 
room after the committee meeting ended. The foreign minister 
said there was nothing to report, at least in public: 
  [Peres] Nothing for the public knowledge yet. 
  [Ze'ev] But Peres made it clear that Israeli rejection of at 
least certain Palestinian demands is not final. The PLO has 
been told by Israel: Let's get the Gaza-Jericho First self-rule 
arrangements moving and then you may raise the demands again. 
  [Peres] There were requests that were rejected, and Chairman 
'Arafat returned to them. Actually we told the Palestinians: 
Look, this is not the end of the story. We do not understand 
'Arafat's claim that this is a Bantustan, because in a matter of 
several months we are going to continue the negotiations about 
other parts of the West Bank. So actually what they are 
claiming is not land, but wasting time [sentence as heard]. In 
due course we shall continue the negotiations. It is not a 
closed story. 
  [Ze'ev] Inside the committee room the foreign minister is 
said to have insisted that Israel will not compromise on 
controlling security at the border crossings into Jordan from 
the Jericho area, and into Egypt from Gaza. Peres said the 
Palestinians have withdrawn their demand for an international 
force. But in response to a question, Peres did not rule out 
that Jewish settlers could be uprooted, though he said it would 
be an internal Israeli decision, not in the shadow of the 
negotiations. And on the upcoming summit between U.S. President 
Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafiz al- Asad, Peres said 
despite the high hopes in the United States for dramatic 
progress, he has his doubts. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has called on the 
Palestinians to start discussing the issues agreed on in Cairo, 
because when agreements are made, they should be honored. 
  Speaking to our correspondent Sheli Yehimovich this morning, 
Minister Peres said that although 'Arafat has the right to 
reject the Cairo agreement, this rejection leads to the 
conclusion that a meeting would be pointless. 
  He added that Palestinian rivalries are hurting the main 
goal 
of advancing toward peace, which should be put before squabbles. 
Mr. Peres noted that Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], head of the 
Palestinian delegation, is the one who should have spoken about 
the Cairo agreement, but after confirming the existence of the 
agreement in a television interview, Abu-Mazin became mute and 
Nabil Sha'th took the floor. 
  Referring to Knesset Member Dalya Itzik's proposal to give 
up 
the Qatif Bloc in exchange for the Palestinians' agreeing to 
reduce the Jericho area, Minister Peres said he is categorically 
opposed to this.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yoel Zinger, Foreign Ministry legal adviser, </F>
by Ruba al-Husari in Jerusalem--date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Husari] There have been conflicting Israeli 
and Palestinian assessments of what has been agreed on in Cairo. 
Why? 
  [Zinger] We approved a document in Cairo last Tuesday. It 
was close to an agreement. Now, we are trying to obtain the 
Palestinian and Israeli leaders' approval of that document. 
Despite certain statements, we have received signals that the 
Palestinian reply would not be "Yes" or "No," but "Yes, but." 
The Egyptian side is exerting great efforts with President 
Yasir 'Arafat. Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, his adviser 
Usamah al-Baz, and Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa told us in the 
presence of the Palestinian delegation that they would try to 
make the agreement possible. The main idea was that if 
'Arafat's reservations on the document were rather positive, 
'Amr Musa would visit Israel to try to persuade us to accept the 
Palestinians's reservations. We have presented our concept to 
the Palestinians in 108 pages under the headline: "The Israeli 
Proposal: Agreement on Gaza Strip and Jericho Area," dated 22 
December 1993, and the Palestinians presented their concept in a 
similar file. We are now trying to come out with a unified, 
acceptable concept. 
  [Al-Husari] When will the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement be signed? 
  [Zinger] We are now discussing four subjects defined by 
Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat to be solved before other 
subjects. They are: 
  1. Foreign security along borders with Egypt and Jordan. 
  2. Crossing arrangements on border points. 
  3. The size of the Jericho area. 
  4. Other issues pertaining to the size of settlements in 
the Gaza Strip. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Husari] Yitzhaq Rabin said that he was not sure about 
Israeli withdrawal by 13 April. Is that surprising? 
  [Zinger] He is right. The Declaration of Principles 
stipulates that the implementation will begin immediately after 
signing the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and that we will still have 
four months to go, starting from the date of the signing in 
order to complete the withdrawal. If we do not end the 
negotiations within four months, the withdrawal will be 
postponed. If we do not sign, no withdrawal will take place. 
However, I believe we can reach an agreement and sign it by 
mid-April. 
  [Al-Husari] It is clear to everybody that Yasir 'Arafat 
needs 
a quick agreement. Is Israel in a hurry too to reach such an 
agreement? 
  [Zinger] I do not know if we are in a hurry. We have made 
commitments and we want to comply with them as soon as possible. 
We must expect a delay of a few weeks or months, but this 
situation must not drag out further since the agreement risks 
meeting the same fate as that of Camp David. We wanted to 
negotiate with the PLO because it was facing problems and was 
about to disappear. We realized that it was in nobody's 
interest for it to disappear and for Israel to remain alone 
facing several organizations, none of which is able to speak in 
the name of all the Palestinian people and to impose itself on 
them. Therefore, a further delay in implementation of the 
agreement could lead not only to the PLO's disappearance, but 
also to its collapse. This is in nobody's interest. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Al-Husari] You were quoted as saying at the meeting of the 
Knesset Foreign Affairs and Security Committee that the military 
rule will remain the source of power in the self-rule areas. 
What does this mean? 
  [Zinger] In the Declaration of Principles we agreed to 
dissolve the civil administration and end the military rule, but 
without dissolving it. The powers that will not be transferred 
to the Palestinians will remain in the hands of the military 
rule. The headquarters of the military rule will be located 
anywhere outside the self-rule area in Gaza. The work of the 
military rule will focus on the affairs of the settlements and 
the Israelis. 
  [Al-Husari] Will the military rule continue to issue 
military 
orders as the case has been since 1967? 
  [Zinger] I do not know. The military rule might issue orders 
related to settlements, such as preventing the Israelis from 
entering Gaza. And the only way to do this is through military 
rule. The military rule might also issue orders related to 
external security. The important thing is that, theoretically, 
we are not talking about independence. Therefore, we will not 
abolish the military rule and will not completely end Israeli 
control. 
  [Al-Husari] Will you maintain military rule because you 
think 
there will be a need to return to the occupied territory one day? 
  [Zinger] If I can read the Israeli Government's mind well, I 
think Israel does not want to return to Gaza at all. On the 
contrary, it might fear that one day this will be its only 
choice if the Palestinian police force fails to carry out its 
duties. We might be forced to do something we hate to do. We 
want to leave the Gaza Strip and never go back to it. Another 
situation might emerge if a large-scale war breaks out in the 
region. 
  [Al-Husari] Does this apply to the West Bank? 
  [Zinger] The situation in the West Bank is very complicated. 
For this reason, we are only talking about Gaza first. There 
are many differences between Gaza and the West Bank. In the 
West Bank, we are facing on the eastern front countries, who are 
still in a state of war with Israel. This situation does not 
exist in Gaza, because in Gaza there is only Egypt. In Gaza, 
there are 4,000 Israelis, while in the West Bank there are 
100,000 Israelis. We find a solution to the four settlement 
areas by linking them through one road to Israel. Therefore, 
the Israelis will use four roads in Gaza only. This, however, 
will be impossible to apply in the West Bank. 
  [Al-Husari] Will the final status of the West Bank be 
different from that of the Gaza Strip? 
  [Zinger] The answer might be yes and no. In Gaza, there is 
no water problem, while in the West Bank there is only one water 
reserve. And in Gaza there are no holy places while in the West 
Bank there are many holy places some of which are common [to 
Muslims, Christians, and Jews]. The West Bank is different from 
Gaza in everything. Therefore, we decided to concentrate on 
Gaza now and not to think at all, in the current stage, of what 
is taking place in the West Bank. 
  [Al-Husari] Have you noticed any difference in the talks 
with 
the Palestinians when the negotiators are changed, such as the 
absence or presence of Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas]? 
  [Zinger] I believe that the Declaration of Principles could 
not have been reached in Oslo without Abu-Mazin and Abu-'Ala' 
[Ahmad Quray']. They were the catalysts within the PLO, and 
they are the ones who understand the spirit of the Declaration 
of Principles. When we began talks on the implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles, neither attended these talks and we 
found ourselves in front of new people. The problem here is 
that those new negotiators have to begin from square one and 
that they sometimes think they can use their skills to improve 
the Oslo accord. However, since they were not in the operation 
room when the accord was concluded they do not know its real 
components because it was ready before them.

  [Text] Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu says Israel's 
agreement with the PLO, which was signed in September and 
approved by the Knesset, will not be binding on him or any 
government he might lead. He was speaking during a visit to the 
Jordan Valley moshav Na'ama, some five kilometers north of 
Jericho. According to the draft agreement reached in Cairo, 
Na'ama will reportedly be bordered to the east and to the north 
by the Palestinian autonomous zone. In Na'ama today was 
reporter Dick Winter: 
  [Begin recording] [Winter] Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu 
dropped his bombshell after Na'ama members accused him of 
selling them out, when in September after the Knesset approved 
the Israel-PLO accord, he pledged then that the Likud would 
honor the agreement if they came to power. Now, says Netanyahu, 
the situation has changed: 
  [Netanyahu] Agreements are made to be abided by, but that 
cannot be a unilateral action. In fact, the PLO has already 
violated the central tenets of the agreement. It hasn't 
canceled the PLO charter, as it promised; it hasn't espoused an 
antiterror policy. What it has done, in fact, is the very 
opposite. So if the PLO violated this agreement, I don't see 
why we should be bound by it. In all international law, an 
agreement that is not kept by the other side does not bind the 
other signatory. That is the common thing. Contracts are not 
one-sided. If one side violates, it doesn't oblige the other, 
and in this case the PLO has clearly violated this agreement 
completely, eviscerated it of any meaning, abrogated it central 
tenets, and therefore I will not see this agreement as binding 
on a government that I would lead. 
  [Winter] Addressing the Na'ama settlers, most of whom were 
Rabin supporters in the last elections, Netanyahu said he 
couldn't believe that the Labor Party, much less the Likud, 
could support an agreement which reportedly leaves Na'ama 
bordered to the east and to the north by the Palestinian 
autonomous zone. As to his program, this is what the Likud 
leader had to say: 
  [Netanyahu] I think what we have to see is an alternative 
plan that gives autonomy to the Palestinian Arabs in their 
cities and their villages and gives Israel control over 
security. Security for Israel, autonomy for the Arabs, and not 
a PLO state that would perhaps fast become the bridgehead for 
another war against Israel. 
  [Winter] Displaying to reporters the document including what 
he said were the latest Israeli proposals to the Palestinians -- 
but not giving many details -- Netanyahu said they were a 
blueprint not for autonomy, but for a Palestinian state. [end 
recording]

position in its struggle with Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement]. For this reason Israel must sometimes implement moves 
which are aimed at having long-term effects. 
  Our correspondent Shim'on Vilna'i says that Brig. Gen. 
Schiff 
was referring to the government's decision to release security 
prisoners. The military judge advocate emphasized that Israel's 
present policy is not to release prisoners with blood on their

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Jan (MENA)--Shulamit Aloni, Israeli 
minister of sciences and communications [title as received], has 
emphasized that Egyptian diplomacy has played a magnificent role 
in bringing the views of those involved in the Middle East 
crisis closer so that peace and prosperity can prevail in the 
region. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM today, Tuesday, she said: As a 
sign of goodwill, we gave Egypt a map with details of the huge 
resources that are hidden under the Sinai sands, but we found 
out that Egypt has a similar map and knows everything about the 
Sinai's resources. 
  She expressed pleasure at the telephone links between Israel 
and all the Arab countries and noted that any citizen in any 
Arab country can talk directly to anyone in Israel. 
  On the failure of starting the planned Israeli withdrawal 
from Gaza and Jericho, she said: We are actually ready to 
implement our obligations in the Gaza-Jericho Accord and for the 
Palestinians to begin to handle their affairs in the self-rule 
areas by themselves. But she noted differences in views on this 
issue between the government, which wants peace, and others who 
do not want peace, as she put it. 
  She said she accepts giving up all the territories occupied 
after the 1967 war and that the Palestinians have the right to 
establish their state in the West Bank and Gaza. However, she 
remarked that this is not the government's view. 
  Replying to a question on reports that Israel and Jordan 
have 
reached an unannounced peace agreement, she said that an 
agreement in principle has actually been reached with Jordan and 
that King Husayn is awaiting developments in the negotiations 
with Syria before announcing the agreement. 
  The Israeli minister said negotiations with Syria will begin 
very soon. She affirmed Israel's readiness to give up the Golan 
if President Hafiz al-Asad is willing to establish a genuine

  [Text] Touring the Golan Heights this morning, Minister 
Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer said that the government has neither 
formulated stands nor held debates in anticipation of President 
Clinton's meeting with President al-Asad in 10 days in Geneva, 
although informal contacts between top Washington echelons and 
Israeli leaders may have taken place in preparation for the 
meeting. 
  He told our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling that the 
government will not announce its intentions with regard to the 
Golan in advance, but neither will it avoid difficult decisions, 
and when required to decide whether and how much to cede, it 
will do so. He asserted that the Golan was conquered because of 
security considerations alone and that the government will not 
negotiate on it until Syria realizes that our security and very 
existence constitute the essence of our presence on the Golan. 
  The construction and housing minister inaugurated a new 
housing project in Qatzrin today. The project consists of 500 
housing units, most of which have been sold. Replying to 
reporters questions, Minister Ben-Eli'ezer said the inauguration 
of the project and his tour of the Golan 10 days before the 
Clinton-al-Asad summit have no political significance. He noted 
that the tour was planned three months ago and that the 
government will continue to aid in the development and expansion 
of the Golan settlements.

  [Text] Itamar Rabinovich, the Israeli ambassador in 
Washington, does not believe the discussions of Israeli and 
Syrian academics regarding a possible arrangement on the Golan 
Heights will accelerate or facilitate the official negotiations 
on this issue, which are slated to resume in Washington in about 
one month. 
  Ambassador Rabinovich told our correspondent in Washington 
Arye Golan, however, that the fact that over the last year the 
Syrian regime has permitted some of its citizens to meet 
Israelis for the purpose of discussing the peace process is 
another sign pointing at a change in Syria's attitude. 
Ambassador Rabinovich said that this can be seen as a sign of 
the seriousness with which Syria regards the negotiations with 
Israel.

promised inhabitants of the Jordan Valley there will be 
territorial contiguity along Israel's eastern border. Our

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, Jan 3 (AFP)--Israeli 
troops on Monday [3 January] shot and killed three Palestinian 
teenagers in the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab sources said. 
  Troops fatally shot Fadil Ibrahim Rihan, 19, in the mouth 
after he threw stones at an army jeep patrolling the Jabalyah 
refugee camp, while elite troops shot 'Abbas Khadir al-Sa'idi, 
18, in the al-Shati' camp, they said. 
  Taxi driver Ibrahim Abu-Dan told AFP that he saw soldiers, 
who were looking for Palestinians who had fled in a Peugeot 404 
car, first wounding al-Sa'idi and then finishing him off with a 
second shot. 
  Farid Sha'rawi, 19, was killed by a bullet which penetrated 
his abdomen when Israeli soldiers opened fire in the al-Shati' 
camp at demonstrators showering them with stones. 
  Tension was clearly mounting in Gaza Monday night despite a 
curfew which takes effect every evening as of 8:00 p.m. (1800 
GMT), the same sources said. 
  These deaths bring to 1,163 the number of Palestinians 
killed 
by Israeli bullets in the occupied territories since the 
uprising erupted six years ago, according to an AFP toll. 
  Also on Monday, Palestinian sources here said Israeli troops 
have arrested two members of PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah 
faction who are suspected of murdering two Israelis last week. 
  In a raid Sunday on the Gaza Strip's Khan Yunus refugee 
camp, 
they arrested Farid al-Qaysi, 21, and 'Ala Abu-Sita, 20, on 
charges of killing alleged drug dealers Hayim Weizmann, 34, and 
David Bublil, 41, near Tel Aviv last Friday. 
  The two were reportedly seen writing on the main Khan Yunus 
mosque that "the Ahmad Abu-Rish group carried out the murder of 
the two Zionist dogs at al-Ramlah to avenge the army's killing 
of Ahmad Abu Rish." 
  Al-Qaysi, Abu-Sita and two other Palestinians who were at 
large had shown camp residents four ears they said they had cut 
from their victims, Palestinians said. 
  Undercover Israeli troops shot dead Ahmad Khalid Abu-Rish, a 
20-year-old member of the Fatah Hawks, on November 28, shortly 
after he had been set free from prison. 
  The Hawks vowed afterwards to resume their armed attacks 
which they had abandoned on Arafat's orders following the 
September 13 autonomy accord. 
  The army also arrested Muhammad Abu-Rish, a former member of 
the Islamic Jihad movement who had been pardoned at the same 
time as his brother Ahmad. 
  Soldiers also raided the al-Burayj camp and arrested Yasir 
Taha, 20, a member of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qasim, the armed wing 
of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).

year ago. Senior military sources have said that more than 20 
roadblocks were removed. The IDF forces in the West Bank

  [A report by ITIM correspondent Dani Zaqen on page 1 of Tel

Jerusalem and the PLO leadership have officially confirmed an 
ITIM report from last week according to which the security 
forces completely ceased hunting Fatah terrorists in the 
territories, including those who committed murders of Israelis 
and Palestinians." The report goes on to say that "senior 
military elements" have expressed opposition to this move, 
saying that "it delivers a death blow to the IDF deterrence 
power." HATZOFE adds that "this opposition has been relayed to 
the IDF command and through it to the prime minister, and it has 
been learned that Rabin is currently considering rejecting or 
postponing the move."]

Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa at the Royal Hashemite Court today. 
His Highness Crown Prince Hasan attended the meeting. [passage 
omitted] 
  Talal al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign affairs, and 
'Amr Musa praised the results of the Jordanian-Egyptian talks 
held in Amman today. They emphasized the importance of these 
talks in developing bilateral cooperation and bolstering 
bilateral and Arab coordination in order to unite the Arab 
position. 
  This has come in press statements made by the two ministers 
at the Amman Airport before the Egyptian foreign minister left 
Amman today at the end of a short working visit to Jordan. 
  Al-Hasan described the meeting between His Majesty King 
Husayn and the guest minister as cordial and fruitful, and said 
the meeting reviewed bilateral relations in general and ways of 
developing them. The peace process as a whole and each of the 
tracks were also discussed. 
  He said it was agreed during the Jordanian-Egyptian meetings 
to support bilateral coordination and Arab coordination in 
general in order to realize higher Arab interests. The minister 
emphasized the importance of the Arab economic coordination as 
complementary to the political coordination. He said: During 
'Amr Musa's visit to Jordan talks addressed activating bilateral 
economic relations and convening a meeting for the Higher 
Jordanian-Egyptian Joint Committee, led by the prime ministers 
of both countries in order to discuss developing bilateral 
cooperation in all fields as an enhancement to bilateral 
economic cooperation. 
  'Amr Musa described his visit to Amman as fruitful and 
successful. He said: I was honored to meet with His majesty 
King Husayn, and I conveyed to his majesty a message from his 
brother His Excellency President Muhammad Husni Mubarak. The 
meeting was very good and long talks were held on the peace 
process--its past, present, and future--the importance of Arab 
coordination on this issue, and the other tracks of the peace 
process. Talks also dealt with bilateral relations and means of 
developing them, and it was agreed to hold a meeting of the 
Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Joint Committee. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa held talks 
with his majesty the king and other Jordanian officials on 
Middle East peace during a brief visit to the Kingdom. [passage 
omitted] 
  Musa told reporters before he left Amman that he conveyed to 
his majesty a message from President Husni Mubarak, and that he 
had a long discussion with his majesty on the past, present, and 
future of the peace process, in addition to bilateral ties. 
  He said he agreed with Jordanian officials to convene a 
meeting of the Higher Jordanian-Egyptian Cooperation Committee. 
  Musa voiced hope that Arab relations could be reconciled, 
and 
called for speedy efforts to heal rifts among Arab states. Musa 
said his country's mediation had not yet succeeded in breaking 
the deadlock between Israel and the PLO over the implementation 
of the Palestinian autonomy document. 
  He said he expected further delay before PLO and Israeli 
negotiations could resume on ways to implement the self-rule 
deal. He said the Taba talks will resume very soon despite the 
stalemate which he described as not very serious. 
  He added that Egypt would not exercise any pressure on the 
PLO. 
  [Begin recording] [Musa] There is no pressure on the PLO by 
us. We listen to what the PLO leaders have to say. We try to 
help when our help is needed, and when we are called upon to 
help, but there is nothing at all that would pertain to, or be 
construed as pressure on the PLO. 
  [Reporter] Isn't it true that in fact agreement was reached 
in the last Cairo talks? What's your position on that? 
  [Musa] I believe there will be a meeting of the Gaza-Jericho 
committee, the liaison committee in Taba soon I hope, and 
therefore, it is not a question of what happened or what took 
place. The important thing is what should take place from now 
on. [end recording] 
  Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Talal al-Hasan also 
told reporters that Jordan and Egypt agreed to move ahead with 
strengthening bilateral cooperation.

  [Text] Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al 
Thani arrived in Amman this afternoon on a two-day visit to 
Jordan, during which he will hold talks on bolstering bilateral 
relations and the Arab situation. 
  On a statement to reporters on arrival, the Qatari minister 
said: 
  [Begin recording] [Al Thani] In the name of God, the 
merciful, the compassionate. I am grateful for the warm 
reception by the brothers in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. 
Of course, the visit comes within the framework of the 
long-standing fraternal bilateral relations. Today's visit aims 
to bolster this position, and if there is any misunderstanding 
or anything else to place things in a sound framework--a 
framework of brotherhood and cooperation, and within the 
framework of realizing Arab solidarity [sentence incomplete as 
heard]. 
  [Reporter] Your Excellency the Minister, what is the State 
of 
Qatar's view on Arab solidarity? 
  [Al Thani] We have stated several times that Arab solidarity 
is a necessity. If there is something to be discussed, in my 
view we can discuss it face to face as Arabs, and there is no 
need for estrangement. We should speak face to face and put 
things on the right track. 
  [Reporter] Are you carrying a message to his majesty the 
king 
from his highness the amir? 
  [Al Thani] Of course, I will convey the greetings of his 
highness the amir and his highness the heir apparent to his 
majesty the king and His Highness Prince Hasan. At the same 
time, I will convey a verbal message. 
  [Reporter] Your Excellency, would you sum up Qatar's 
position 
on the peace process, especially concerning holy Jerusalem? 
  [Al Thani] Since the very beginning of this problem with the 
Israeli occupation of Palestine, the State of Qatar has been 
adopting a clear position. Qatar supports the brothers, whether 
in Palestine or other Arab countries that were harmed by the 
[Israeli] occupation in 1967. We support the Palestinian 
people's peace understanding which they reached with Israel. It 
is a Palestinian affair, and we only support the brothers, 
whether in peace or in other conditions--we support them with 
the capabilities available to us. 
  [Reporter] What about holy Jerusalem? 
  [Al Thani] Of course, this is the first of the two qiblas, 
and it is important to us as Muslims. We do not want to see 
Jerusalem remain in non-Islamic or non-Arab hands. [end 
recording] 
  For his part, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for 
foreign affairs, said: 
  [Begin al-Hasan recording] I would like to point out the 
good 
and fraternal relations between Jordan and Qatar. These 
relations are long-standing and are developing, praise be to 
God. His Majesty King Husayn and his brother His Highness 
Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani have been eager to bolster 
these relations in various fields and on various levels. 
Undoubtedly, the visit of my brother and friend Qatari Foreign 
Minister Shaykh Hamad Al Thani to his country and kinsfolk in 
Jordan will bolster and develop these relations. The visit will 
surely lead to a qualitative shift concerning the implementation 
of all agreements and protocols annexed to them, which 
undoubtedly will foster fraternal relations. This is not 
restricted to the bilateral field. The visit of his excellency 
the minister will constitute a shift toward bolstering Arab 
ranks and Arab solidarity, which we hope to be in its best 
shape, God willing. [end recording]

  They reviewed the fraternal and distinguished bilateral 
relations between the two fraternal countries and peoples, 
established by His Majesty King Husayn and his brother His 
Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, amir of the State 
of Qatar. 
  The two sides emphasized the importance of developing and 
fostering bilateral cooperation in all fields, and agreed to 
form a joint committee headed by minister of state for foreign 
affairs and the Qatari foreign minister to activate and follow 
up the development of bilateral relations in various fields in

and 
emphasized Jordan's firm commitment to this process, both in its

constants and principles on which the peace process was 
established. These constants and principles are the 
implementation of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the 
exchange of land for peace, the Palestinian legitimate rights on 
the Palestinian national soil, restoration of Arab rights in 
land and water, a solution to the problems of the refugees and 
displaced persons in accordance with the resolutions of 
international legitimacy, and full Israeli withdrawal from the

on all tracks with the aim of reaching a just, comprehensive, 
and lasting peace in the region.

challenges Jordan is facing, and referred to the blockade 
imposed on al-'Aqabah port and the subsequent losses to the 
Jordanian economy. He also explained the democratic march in 
Jordan and the recent parliamentary elections.

the warm reception he and his delegation were accorded, and 
emphasized the depth of fraternal bilateral relations, and the 
eagerness of the State of Qatar to bolster and develop these 
relations within the framework of bolstering Arab solidarity. 
The minister hailed Jordan's role in the peace process and 
emphasized his country's support for the peace process in a

legitimate rights of the Palestinian people on their national 
soil, in accordance with the resolutions of international 
legitimacy and the principles on which the peace process was set 
up.

international issues of mutual concern, and exchanged views on 
them.

guest minister, secretaries general of the Foreign Ministry and 
Industry and Commerce Ministry, the Jordanian ambassador to 
Qatar, Qatari ambassador in Amman, and a number of Foreign 
Ministry officials.

  [Text] Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, the minister of state for 
foreign affairs, and Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani, the Qatari 
foreign minister, today held a news conference at al-Hashimiyah 
Palace. During the news conference, the two sides spoke about 
the issues they discussed during their meetings and the results 
of the Qatari minister's talks in Amman. Details are in the 
following report: 
  At the outset of the news conference, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, 
the minister of state for foreign affairs, welcomed the Qatari 
minister, stressing the similarity in the viewpoints of the two 
fraternal countries on various issues discussed during the 
visit. The Qatari foreign minister thanked His Majesty King 
Husayn and His Highness Crown Prince Hasan for the warm 
reception he received during his visit. He said: 
  "I would like to express my deep thanks to His Majesty King 
Husayn and his highness the crown prince for the warm reception 
my accompanying delegation and I have received. Moreover, I 
thank his majesty for the medal he has awarded me. This is a 
great honor for me and for the brothers accompanying me during 
this visit. 
  "As for the nature of the talks, of course, there were 
special talks between Qatar and Jordan and there were special 
talks about Arab cooperation and reunification. Moreover, there 
were talks that dealt with some international issues, especially 
the peace process and what is taking place on this course. We 
discussed these issues with total frankness and a logic that 
should prevail in our inter-Arab relations. 
  "Of course, I conveyed a message from his highness the Amir 
[of Qatar] and received a reply from His Majesty King Husayn 
that falls within the context of the cooperation and ancient 
brotherly relations between the two. 
  "The current higher joint committee will organize all the 
actions to be taken with respect to previous agreements. There 
is no reason why a visit by Qatar's heir apparent to Jordan 
should not take place in return for His Highness Crown Prince 
Hasan's visit. We are with Jordan whether his highness the 
crown prince visits Qatar or the Qatari heir apparent visits 
Jordan, as it is his second country." 
  Asked about the role that Qatar could play to clear the 
Arab atmosphere, the Qatari foreign minister said: 
  "In fact, the relations should be clear from the beginning 
and all Arab countries should be frank with each other, not in 
order to defame one another but to overcome any crisis and 
misunderstanding and to surpass difficulties and the crises the 
Arab world faced recently. 
  "There is no doubt that Qatar is a small country. However, 
we hope that we will play a role that is not aimed at achieving 
any kind of victory but at clearing the Arab atmosphere. This 
is because we, the people and government of Qatar, believe that 
there can be no victory for the Arabs except through their 
unity. If we wanted to look back on the past, we would recall 
that Arab unanimity during the 1973 war was achieved because of 
frank Arab solidarity. All our victories were achieved through 
our solidarity, while all our problems and tragedies have been 
due to division and to the method of dealing which, we believe, 
should not prevail among Arab countries." 
  Asked about Jordanian-Qatari relations, in general, the 
Qatari foreign minister said: 
  "These relations, as I said earlier, are ancient relations. 
Our relations with Jordan were not affected at any time. There 
is no doubt that a misunderstanding took place during the recent 
Gulf crisis and the occupation of Kuwait. We believe that we 
should overcome this misunderstanding despite how it took place. 
This misunderstanding should be overcome and taken as a lesson 
for our future as an Arab nation. We should stand alongside 
right under any circumstances. This is what Qatar is hoping 
for." 
  For his part, Talal al-Hasan, the minister of state for 
foreign affairs, summed up the results of the visit by saying: 
  "At the end of this positive visit, which I hope will be 
repeated and will lead to more visits between the two countries, 
I would like to say that it was a successful and fruitful one. 
During this visit, we reached constructive agreements which, 
without a doubt, will have a positive reflection on relations 
between the two countries and will yield good results that will 
push the course of bilateral relations forward. I can very 
clearly tell you that understanding was very evident during all 
our meetings and that the identity in views was tangible in all 
the meetings that were held during this visit by his excellency 
the minister and his accompanying delegation. 
  "This visit gains its uniqueness not only from the fact that 
it comes at this particular time, but also from the nature of 
the issues that were discussed during this visit and the great 
similarity in the views the two countries' leaderships hold on 
these issues. This is in addition to the two leadership's joint 
understanding of the need for serious and continuous action to 
correct the Arab situation in order to maintain Arab rights and 
protect this nation's higher joint interests. 
  "It was natural for us to take this opportunity to discuss 
the various circumstances that face our nation, including Arab 
relations, the peace process, and the changes which regional and 
international developments impose on all of us. 
  "Bilateral relations occupied an important part of our talks 
as we proceeded from a determination by His Majesty King Husayn 
and brother His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the 
amir of Qatar, to strengthen these relations and develop them in 
various fields until they reach the required level of strength 
and firmness. This determination was expressed during His 
Highness Crown Prince Hasan's visit to Doha last August and 
during this visit. 
  "I am pleased to note that we reached an agreement on a 
practical formula that represents a mechanism to follow up the 
growth and development of bilateral relations in various fields 
by forming a joint committee at the foreign ministerial level. 
This joint committee will meet periodically in the capitals of 
both countries for this purpose. The committee's first meeting 
will be held during the first quarter of this year in Doha, God 
willing. 
  "Moreover, we reviewed in detail the various agreements that 
organize bilateral relations."

<F P=106> ["Text" of joint statement on the visit to Jordan by Qatar's </F>
foreign minister issued in Amman on 2 Jan -- recorded] 
  [Text] Inspired by His Majesty King Husayn's and his 
brother His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani's wish 
to see a reinforcement of bilateral relations, based on complete 
confidence and brotherly joint cooperation between the two 
brotherly states, a high-level Qatari delegation led by Shaykh 
Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabr Al Thani, the foreign minister of 
Qatar, paid a visit to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan at the 
invitation of Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, Jordan's minister of state 
for foreign affairs, from 1 to 2 January, 1994. 
  The esteemed Qatari guest called on His Majesty King Husayn 
and His Highness Crown Prince Hasan and held talks with the 
prime minister. During these meetings, views were exchanged on 
the close relations between the two brotherly states and how to 
reinforce them in the best interests of the two brotherly 
peoples. 
  The two sides also reviewed the progress made in the Middle 
East peace process and Arab and international developments. 
  His Excellency Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabr Al Thani and 
His Excellency Talal Sat'an al-Hasan and their delegations held 
talks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on bilateral ties and 
cooperation, as well as agreements reached between the two 
countries. Agreement was reached to create a joint committee 
cochaired by the two countries' foreign ministers to oversee the 
implementation of the agreements signed between them and to 
enhance bilateral relations. The two sides agreed that the 
committee is to meet once annually in either of the two 
countries, with the first meeting set for the first quarter of 
1994 in Doha. 
  The two sides surveyed developments in the Gulf region, 
stressing the importance for security and stability there to be 
consolidated and kept free of any threats, taking into 
consideration the principles of international legitimacy and the 
need for the states of the region to respect each other's 
sovereignty and to be bound by the principle of the peaceful 
resolution of any disputes. 
  The two sides reviewed the peace process and the efforts 
exerted to reach a just, comprehensive, and durable peace that 
guarantees the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the 
occupied Arab territories, the head of which is holy Jerusalem. 
They expressed their commitment to the continuation of efforts 
to reach a peaceful solution based on implementing Security 
Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for-peace principle 
and securing the Palestinians' legitimate rights on their 
national soil until the Arab rights to territories and water are 
achieved and the problem of the refugees and displaced is solved 
in compliance with the resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  The two sides exchanged viewpoints on the situation in the 
Arab arena. They expressed the great importance of restoring 
Arab solidarity and the unity of Arab ranks and of adopting the 
principle of frank dialogue and mediation or resorting to 
international law as a better policy to resolve disputes in the 
Arab arena in order to maintain the interests of the Arab nation 
and reinforce and deepen trust among all Arab parties. 
  During their review of developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the two sides condemned the inhuman massacres and acts of mass 
killing and ethnic cleansing against the people of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. They called for an end to these massacres 
and urged the international community to shoulder their 
responsibility. They also called for a fair implementation of 
the resolutions of international legitimacy in order to serve 
the issues of peace in the world. 
  The guest minister expressed his admiration and appreciation 
for the awakening, development, and accomplishments in Jordan in 
all fields thanks to the wise policy adopted by His Majesty King 
Husayn. 
  At the end of the visit, Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani, 
the 
Qatari foreign minister, expressed his deep thanks for the warm 
reception he and his accompanying delegation received. He hoped 
for progress and prosperity in the brotherly bilateral relations. 
  The Qatari foreign minister also extended an invitation to 
Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, Jordan's minister of state for foreign 
affairs, to visit Qatar. Al-Hasan thankfully accepted the 
invitation and promised to respond to it soon.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers met under Prime Minister 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali this morning. It reviewed Arab and 
domestic activities that took place in the Kingdom during the 
past few days, particularly the results of yesterday's visit to 
Jordan by Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. 
  The JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY has learned that the prime 
minister 
explained to the council that during this visit, the negotiating 
position on all fronts was reviewed, with an emphasis on the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Cairo, which were held with 
an Egyptian participation to arrive at an agreement on the 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. 
  Dr. al-Majali indicated that 'Amr Musa explained that there 
are three major points which are still being negotiated between 
the Palestinians and Israelis. The first is supervision of 
traffic over bridges and sovereignty over them. The second is 
the size of the Jericho region from which the Israeli Army will 
withdraw. The third point is the security control of border 
areas which will be evacuated, especially in the Gaza Strip. 
During the visit, Musa affirmed that contrary to the Israeli 
Government's allegation, the Palestinian and Israeli sides have 
not reached an agreement in Cairo, but that a paper was 
presented by the Israeli side which proposed that the 
Palestinian side study it and agree on it with competent PLO 
authorities. During Musa's visit, bilateral relations were also 
discussed, especially with respect to the meetings of the Higher 
Jordanian-Egyptian Joint Committee. It was agreed to activate 
this committee and to convene it under the chairmanship of both 
countries' prime ministers. In accordance with the regular 
order of its meetings, the committee will hold its next meeting 
in Amman soon. 
  During the session, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state 
for foreign affairs, reviewed the most important results that 
have been reached on the bilateral level with the Qatari side 
during Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabir 
Al Thani's recent visit to Jordan. It was agreed to set up a 
joint bilateral committee under the Jordanian minister of state 
for affairs and the Qatari foreign minister to discuss all 
bilateral issues of interest to the two countries, including 
economic, political, and media issues, as well as joint 
investments and cooperation between the private sectors in both 
countries.

<F P=106> [Randah Habib dispatch from Amman] </F>
  [Text] Amman will respect the Palestinian decision on the 
economic agreement between the two sides. King Husayn's 
political adviser Marwan al-Qasim told our radio that if the PLO 
leadership now thinks that there should be a revision or a 
postponement of this subject, then Jordan can only respect the 
independent Palestinian decision. 
  Al-Qasim noted that Jordan's aim behind the agreement, which 
has been ready for the signature of Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat for two months, is to extend assistance and support for 
the Palestinian people and fill the financial and economic 
vacuum in the transitional period until the Palestinian side 
takes over the banking authority. 
  Al-Qasim recalled that the Jordanian move came in response 
to 
a desire expressed by the Palestinians since the beginning of 
joint coordination which began with the peace process. The 
agreement was a result of this coordination, he added. Al-Qasim 
said that the decision to reopen Jordanian banks in the West 
Bank was made in 1985 within a joint agreement aimed at 
extending banking services which would have a vital effect on 
reactivating the economic conditions and enabling the 
Palestinian people to adhere to their land. 
  One bank has been operating in the West Bank since 1986, 
which is the Cairo-Amman Bank. However, since the 
Israeli-Jordanian economic agreement was signed earlier this 
month on reopening Jordanian banks in the occupied territories, 
eight Jordanian banks have expressed interest to operate there.

<F P=106> [Report by Ziyad al-Shillah] </F>
  [Excerpt] Muhammad Sa'id al-Nabulsi, governor of the 
Central Bank of Jordan [CBJ], has announced that the 
Jordanian-Israeli agreement initialed in early December on 
opening branches of Jordanian banks in the occupied West Bank 
provides a comprehensive umbrella allowing for the possibility 
of opening branches of all Jordanian banks. The agreement gives 
the CBJ full responsibility for supervising the work and 
competence of these banks. He said that Jordan is currently 
considering another draft memorandum of understanding concerning 
opening branches of Jordanian banks in the Gaza Strip. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, al-Nabulsi said that 
the Jordanian-Israeli agreement includes a memorandum of 
understanding and seven technical annexes. It is now awaiting 
the approval of the Council of Ministers, which has the right to 
amend, approve, or cancel the agreement. He asserted that 
Jordan's aim is to establish a basis for durable and strong 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations to serve the interests of both 
sides, confront Israel's measures to permanently link the 
Palestinian economy with the Israeli economy, and prevent 
marginalizing Jordan's role both in the economic arrangements 
for the occupied territories and in the regional arrangements. 
  Al-Nabulsi pointed out that the agreement will help toward 
using the Jordanian dinar and Jordanian banking system in the 
occupied territory to facilitate various economic operations 
concerning trade movement and the transfer of capital for 
investment. This will serve Jordanian interests both in 
exporting to the occupied territories and in reaping the 
earnings accrued from these investments. The agreement will 
give the Jordanian banks a new opportunity to give loans and 
invest their surplus cash, something which will reflect 
positively on the size of these banks operations and profits. 
It is expected that the financial and currency markets in 
Jordan will expand, utilizing the occupied territory's financial 
deals. This will expand the base of banking and increase the 
flexibility and efficacy of the Jordanian financial and currency 
policy. 
  Al-Nabulsi said that the framework within which work is 
being 
done is expected to generate an influx of real revenues and 
foreign currencies into the kingdom because of the circulation 
of the Jordanian dinar and the opening of Jordanian Banks in the 
West Bank. 
  Al-Nabulsi noted that Jordan had been in constant contact 
with the Palestinian side concerning the reopening of banks and 
that they were informed of the negotiations procedure and they 
urged Jordan to quickly reach an agreement with the Israeli 
side. He said the agreement on banks realized great progress 
even before the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration 
of Principles and was in harmony with Jordan's banking and 
currency role approved in the draft Palestinian-Jordanian draft 
agreement. Moreover, Jordan responded to the Palestinian side's 
demands to incorporate in the Jordanian-Israeli agreement a 
provision invalidating the memorandum of understanding at the 
end of the Palestinian transitional phase as enunciated in the 
Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles or when the 
banking and currency powers and responsibilities have been 
transferred to the Palestinians. 
  Dr. al-Nabulsi said the most important points in the 
memorandum of understanding signed by Jordan and Israel are the 
following: 
  1. Opening branches of Jordanian banks in the West Bank will 
take place in two stages. In the first stage, all branches of 
Jordanian banks closed in June 1967 will be reopened. In the 
second stage, branches of other Jordanian banks will be opened. 
  2. Any Jordanian bank wishing to open a branch should obtain 
CBJ approval before receiving the approval of the specialized 
quarter in the occupation authority. 
  3. Supervision of the branches will be organized on the 
basis of the Basel international agreement on banking, which 
says that the head office has full responsibility for the 
branches' credit status and liquidity (in Jordanian dinars). 
  4. The CBJ will carry out inspection of branches 
periodically, or whenever there is a need. 
  5. Dismissing the memorandum of understanding signed by the 
two parties on 20 August 1986 and implementing the new 
memorandum of understanding on the branches of Cairo-Amman Bank. 
Implementation of this memorandum will expire when an agreement 
is concluded by the two sides, which should take place before 
the end of the transitional stage as set in the declaration of 
principles signed by the Israeli Government and the PLO on 13 
September 1993, or when the authority and the banking and 
monetary responsibilities are transferred to the Palestinians. 
  He said that it is worth noting that the meaning of the area 
mentioned in the memorandum of understanding is the West Bank. 
Jordan is studying a draft of a similar memorandum of 
understanding on opening branches of Jordanian banks in the Gaza 
Strip. 
  On coordination with the Palestinian side, Dr. al-Nabulsi 
emphasized that Jordan has been in constant contact with the 
Palestinian side on the reopening of branches of Jordanian 
banks. He said the Palestinians were aware of the progress in 
the negotiations, and they urged Jordan to expedite reaching an 
agreement with Israel. It is also worth noting that progress 
was made in the negotiations on the banks before the 
announcement of the Palestinian-Israeli declaration of 
principles. These negotiations have been in harmony with 
Jordan's monetary and banking role as agreed on in the 
Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement. Furthermore, Jordan 
responded to the Palestinian request for adding an article in 
the Jordanian-Israeli agreement that ends the memorandum of 
understanding immediately with the end of the transitional stage 
in accordance with the PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles, or 
when the authority and financial and monetary responsibilities 
are transferred to the Palestinians. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Husayn-'Arafat Meeting"] </F>
  [Text] The meeting which took place between His Majesty 
King Husayn and His Excellency Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat at the International Queen Alia Airport yesterday has 
revived Jordanian-Palestinian coordination. This coordination 
has had its ups and downs throughout the peace process. 
  Yesterday's two-hour talks between King Husayn and 'Arafat 
come at a time when the Israeli intentions have been exposed in 
a blatant and contemptuous way and when it has become clear that 
Israel was obstructing the Gaza-Jericho First accord. In fact, 
Israel is intentionally following the course of maneuvering, 
procrastination, and deception in an attempt to torpedo the 
entire peace process now that it has achieved political, 
diplomatic, and economic gains from its alleged concern for 
peace and interests in launching a new stage of coexistence in 
the region. 
  The Jordanian and Palestinian sides assert the need to 
embark 
on a new stage of a long-term and clear earnest coordination 
between Jordan and Palestine. Such coordination will guarantee 
the Palestinian people's legitimate rights on their national 
soil, enable the Palestinian people to remain steadfast, 
alleviate the suffering of this people under occupation, and 
help them live an honorable life. Such coordination will also 
lead to a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace. Asserting 
this coordination is a return to the normal course that has 
always governed the historical relationship between the two 
twins. It is also an exact reflection of existent facts that 
cannot be denied, ignored, or bypassed. 
  The coordination between Jordan and Palestine in the battle 
for peace will have great effects on the two fraternal people, 
their interests, and their rights. It also constitutes a pillar 
and support for each part in its confrontation against the 
Israeli maneuvering and attempts to bypass the Palestinian 
people's legitimate rights to their land and homeland. This 
coordination -- in addition to accomplishing coordination with 
the cordon states as well as on the Arab and Islamic levels -- 
is a real guarantee to achieve a just, permanent, and 
comprehensive peace.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Syria Does Not Care About 
Disinformation Campaigns," AL-BA'TH says: As the Geneva summit 
between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton approaches 
with the beginning of the countdown for this important event, we 
expect an escalation in disinformation campaigns against Syria 
and its position on the peace process. Israel has indeed been 
launching these campaigns since the announcement of the summit. 
Israel will continue to escalate these campaigns in a bid to 
besmirch Syria's position first and influence any possible 
results at the summit. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Israel's disinformation campaigns are not the 
first, nor will they be the last. It is a familiar method which 
gets tougher whenever Syria manages to defend all Arab rights. 
  The paper asserts that Syria's stands, which stem from 
leader 
al-Asad's view of the nature of the Arab-Zionist conflict, are 
not likely to change. This is not meant as a hard-line 
approach, but is in line with Syria's concern about reaching a 
just and comprehensive peace in the region. 
  The paper says: It is a fact in politics that whenever the 
enemy's attacks against you gets tougher, it is evidence of your 
sound position. Syria is in no need of any such evidence. In 
light of the historic leadership of President al-Asad, Syria 
knows exactly what it wants and this has become a deep-rooted 
approach that reflects the nation's conscience and aspirations. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: At any rate, the upcoming summit between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton will attract the 
attention of the world which pins high hopes on the summit. No 
matter how tough Israel's rabid campaigns against Syria get, 
they will not affect Syria's stands and convictions, especially 
since its policy does not know secrets and corridors.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In a commentary today, the newspaper TISHRIN 
addresses the normalization agreement signed between the Vatican 
and Israel to pave the way for the establishment of full 
diplomatic ties. Under the headline "The Vatican and Israel," 
TISHRIN says: The agreement has flagrantly overlooked the 
sufferings of the Palestinian people living under occupation, as 
well as their right to self-determination. It has also 
disregarded the issue of Jerusalem. Thus, the Vatican has acted 
against its declared stands since 1948 with regard to freedom 
for the Palestinian people and Jerusalem, particularly since 
Israel has repeatedly said that it will never return Jerusalem 
to its rightful owners, and that Jerusalem will remain Israel's 
eternal capital. 
  TISHRIN adds: It is striking that the Vatican which, like 
many world states, is watching the hateful and racist operations 
taking place in the occupied territories, should nullify, by 
this agreement, all the sympathy it demonstrated toward the 
Palestinian people's cause, and Palestinian children, who are 
being killed by Israeli bullets. 
  The paper goes on to say: The Vatican has forgotten or 
chosen to forget the ordeal of the Palestinian people, who were 
displaced by Israel and whose lands were confiscated by Israel. 
In Article 4 of the normalization agreement, there is a pledge 
to respect the existing situation; namely, Israeli occupation. 
Even more dangerous is the normalization agreement that is 
meant to pave the way for a visit to occupied Jerusalem by the 
Holy See. Then, new developments in the interest of Israel and 
Zionism will surface. This will promote their hostile schemes 
in the region. 
  Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: The agreement has 
failed to note in any way whatsoever the future of the holy 
city, and overlooked the fate of an entire population; namely, 
the Palestinian people.

  [Text] President Ilyas al-Hirawi hosted a working dinner 
this evening in honor of British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. 
It was attended by Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, 
Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz, 
and the British ambassador to Lebanon. 
  Earlier, the British official held a round of talks with 
Foreign Minister Buwayz at Bustrus Palace [Foreign Ministry]. 
Their discussion touched on the peace talks, developments in 
the region, and the participation of specialized British firms 
in the reconstruction of Lebanon. 
  In a joint news conference with Minister Buwayz, Hurd 
expressed Britain's support for UN Resolution 425. He praised 
the Lebanese people's efforts to rebuild their country. He 
pointed out that he is not mediating the peace process, but he 
noted his country's interest in facilitating the peace process 
on all tracks. Hurd viewed the Lebanese-Syrian coordination in 
the peace process as a source of momentum for this process. 
  The British secretary is scheduled to leave Beirut tonight 
for occupied Jerusalem, the second leg of his Middle East tour, 
which will also take him to Jordan.

  [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd arrived in 
Beirut at 1900 and left for Israel at 2200 yesterday. He began 
his talks in a meeting with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz at the 
Foreign Ministry. After a news conference, the two proceeded to 
the Presidential Palace, where a meeting was held with President 
Ilyas al-Hirawi, Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri, and 
Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri. President al-Hirawi held a 
dinner banquet in honor of Hurd, which was attended by Birri, 
al-Hariri, Buwayz, and a number of ministers. 
  At a news conference following his talks with Buwayz, the 
British foreign secretary said that his visit to Beirut has two 
goals: The first is to learn all the latest developments 
regarding the peace process that pertain to Lebanon. He said: 
We in Britain realize that peace must be comprehensive and 
involve an agreement between Israel and Lebanon as well as the 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 to open the 
way for the implementation of the al-Ta'if Agreement and to 
enable Lebanon to regain its full independence. This is 
important to us. 
  Hurd added: The second goal goes beyond the peace process. 
You in Lebanon are embarking on a reconstruction process after 
the war with skill, enthusiasm, and dynamism, as anyone would 
expect from the Lebanese on economic issues. I am anxious to 
understand what is happening so that we in Britain can translate 
this into cooperation and assistance, and this is what I did. I 
am pleased to note that our British exports to Lebanon increased 
quickly in the last month of last year. I am very pleased that 
British companies are interested in the airport project. I hope 
that the increasing exchange of trade and ministerial visits 
will help promote such cooperation. 
  He added: I want cooperation to expand to include the 
cultural field, cooperation between our armed forces, and 
cooperation in combating drug trafficking. 
  Hurd explained that he did not come as a mediator in the 
Middle East negotiations. But Britain has an interest in the 
success of the peace process, and if it can do something to 
help, it will do so without becoming a mediator. 
  Hurd said: Lebanon is a principal partner in the Middle East 
peace process. Peace must be comprehensive. We welcomed the 
September agreement between the PLO and Israel. We think that 
this is a very important step forward. But it is clear to me 
that it will not become final until agreements are concluded 
between Israel and Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. We are 
maintaining close contacts with the Jordanians, the Israelis, 
and the Syrians. He noted that the summit meeting between 
Presidents Clinton and al-Asad is very important and expressed 
the hope that it will advance the negotiations on the 
Syrian-Israeli track and make it possible to overcome the 
difficulties. He noted that he is in touch with the U.S. 
secretary of state on the peace process. 
  Hurd affirmed Britain's support for UN Security Council 
Resolution 425 and said: All these matters are linked to the 
al-Ta'if Agreement, which we strongly support. These matters 
must be implemented in stages. Resolution 425 and the al-Ta'if 
Agreement-- which we support--are the basis for progress and for 
Lebanon regaining its complete freedom. 
  Minister Buwayz said: 
  [Begin recording] [Buwayz] I would like first to welcome His 
Excellency Minister Douglas Hurd on his visit to Lebanon. As 
you know, and as I have already said during my visit to the 
United Kingdom, Britain has a long history that qualifies it to 
understand the problems of this area. There is no doubt that as 
Arab foreign ministers we have repeatedly called for effective 
participation by the European countries. When we refer to the 
European countries, we include Britain, of course. We think 
that in view of Britain's historical role in the Middle East, it 
is qualified to play a role in bilateral negotiations and in the 
peace process. 
  The talks between us dealt with the regional situation, the 
peace process, and ways to promote economic and cultural 
cooperation between Lebanon and Britain. We think that 
Lebanon's democracy, its free economic system, and the 
effectiveness of the Lebanese private sector provide numerous 
common denominators between the two countries and peoples and 
make it possible to discuss ways for fruitful cooperation. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, did Secretary Hurd suggest 
anything new to advance the peace process? 
  [Buwayz] Mr. Hurd is closely following the peace process. 
There is no doubt that as a result of his visit and becoming 
acquainted with the Lebanese views on the occupied territory in 
the south, he will be able to play a role in one way or another. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, [words indistinct] 
implementation of Resolution 425? 
  [Buwayz] I think that you have heard Mr. Hurd clearly state 
Britain's frank position on this resolution. I imagine that 
Britain is known for its firm views and positions. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you regard the British role 
today as complementing the U.S. role [words indistinct]? 
  [Buwayz] I imagine that there is cooperation between 
Britain, 
the United States, and a number of European states to promote 
the peace process. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what about the British role in 
the reconstruction of Lebanon? Were there new developments on 
this matter? 
  [Buwayz] Of course, we held talks on this matter. As you 
know, British companies specialize in various sectors. I think 
that Britain is interested in Lebanon because of its democratic 
system and free economy and because of the things we have in 
common. [end recording]

  [Text] Clashes among the warring factions continue in the 
capital city of Afghanistan. However, falling snow has 
curtailed the intensity of the battle. A report dispatched by 
the Voice and Vision correspondent from Kabul indicates that 
following the heavy battles of the past few days, groups of 
people have left their homes to purchase basic essentials. At 
the same time, a large number of people are trying to flee the 
city, fearing that the clashes might intensify again. 
  Our colleague, Darestani, reports by telephone from Kabul on 
the latest developments and the situation in Kabul today: 
  [Darestani] Thousands of family groups, whose houses have 
been demolished during the clashes, began moving toward more 
secure regions today. After three days of heavy battles, the 
government is saying that its forces have succeeded in taking 
control of the important centers of the capital. At the same 
time, General Fahim, the head of Kabul's general security, who 
is one of the top commanders in the Shura-ye Nozzar [Supervisory 
Council], said today: The president's forces are in full 
control of all the central districts in the city of Kabul, 
except part of the heights in the southern and southeastern 
districts and two joint headquarters of General 'Abd-al-Rashid 
Dostam's forces, and the forces of Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e 
Eslami [Islamic Party] along the slopes leading to these 
heights. He added: General Dostam's forces were forced to 
retreat from Kabul airport. 
  At the same time, reports have reached us indicating that 
General Dostam's forces have taken positions in three areas of 
Kabul airport. 
  General Fahim, referring to the efforts undertaken by some 
jehad groups of Afghanistan including Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami, 
Hezb-e Harakat-e Enqelab-e Eslami [Islamic Revolutionary 
Movement] and Hezb-e Jam'iat-e Eslami [Islamic Society], as well 
as Iran and Pakistan to establish a cease-fire in Kabul, further 
added: We regard these efforts positively and if practical steps 
were to be taken to esablish a cease-fire, Borhanoddin Rabbani 
would welcome it. 
  Our colleague, in continuation of his report from Kabul, 
added: The commander of General Dostam's forces has announced 
that the forces under his command have made major advances in 
the battlefields. 
  Speaking from his headquarters in the southeastern suburbs 
of 
Kabul, he described the losses inflicted on Ahmed Shah Mas'ud's 
forces as being very heavy.

  [Text] Bangalore -- The Bangalore-based National Aerospace 
Laboratories (NAL) has signed an agreement with Russia's 
Myasishchev Design Bureau (MDB) to develop a multi-role 
14-seater light transport aircraft to suit the domestic markets 
of the two countries. 
  The two governments entered into an agreement on November 6, 
1993, to produce three prototypes of the aircraft named 
"Saras-duet", by 1996 before taking up serious production in 
both the countries. Government of India has sanctioned Rs. 
[rupees] 20 crore for the Rs. 95 crore project. 
  Rs. 25 crore will be pumped in by a Delhi based exporter who 
has agreed to take up the production after getting certification 
from the DGCA [Director General of Civil Aviation]. However, no 
formal agreement has been signed with the private company. 
  NAL's civil aviation unit head Shivakumar Swamy told INDIAN 
EXPRESS at the Avia India '93 where the Saras-duet mock-model 
became the star attraction, that the concept to develop a light 
transport aircraft was conceived three years ago. 
  While the NAL was working on a design to produce a 14-seater 
aircraft, the Russians too were working on a somewhat similar 
class of aircraft. The two teams got together and worked on a 
common model based on the two designs. Since then the scientists 
of the two countries have been visiting each other at their own 
expense to develop the design of the aircraft. 
  The design configuration has been frozen and NAL and MBD are 
now working on the development of the prototype. 
  Swamy said that the cost would be split between the two 
countries to avoid any transfer of funds. While NAL would 
produce some parts, the MDB would assemble the first prototype 
in Russia by November 1995. Meanwhile, NAL would help the 
Delhi-based private company to set up a plant at Mahr (near 
Bangalore) on a 200 acre plot of land.

  [Text] An experts panel which probed the failure of the 
maiden PSLV [polar satellite launch vehicle] launch last 
September says that a software error in the pitch-controlled 
loop of the guidance and control processor led to the setback. 
According to the chairman of the panel, Mr. N. Pant, the error 
occurred when the control command exceeded the maximum limiting 
value. The panel, however, confirmed that all the major 
systems, including the giant solid booster and the liquid 
propulsion systems of the PSLV worked as planned. There is no 
lacuna in the rocket design also. 
  The finding of the panel was released by the Indian Space 
Research Organization in Bangalore today.

  [Text] Dear listeners, sons of our people in wounded 
Syria, and Arab brothers everywhere: On 16 January, Hafiz 
al-Asad and Bill Clinton will meet in Geneva to conclude a 
once-in-a-lifetime understanding between America and Hafiz 
al-Asad. Immediately following the Geneva meeting, Christopher 
or some other senior American official will begin shuttle trips 
between Damascus and Tel Aviv make arrangements for implementing 
the proposed agreement between al-Asad and Clinton in 
preparation for signing an agreement or peace and cooperation 
treaty between al-Asad and Rabin. These arrangements will 
include 1) coordinating bilateral talks in Washington; 2) 
raising the level of those negotiataing so that al-Shar' will 
meet with Shim'on Peres; 3) preparing for holding a summit 
meeting between al-Asad and Rabin in Cairo, Washington, or 
elsewhere; and 4) resorting to secret talks again in order to 
resolve the problems that cannot be solved in public bilateral 
talks. 
  It seems that Hafiz al-Asad seeks an effective American role 
in the next talks. Why? He wants to achieve greater American 
sponsorship within the framework of his attempts to reinforce 
his local, regional, and international position, both on 
political and economic levels. He wants America to help him 
improve both his domestic and Arab image. He also wants America 
to guarantee the implementation of his coming agreement with the 
Zionist because, as he believes, America is an unbiased and 
effective mediator. He also believes that in the coming stage, 
America would give him a distinguished role, one higher than the 
position of other parties that held talks with the Zionist in 
Madrid and Washington, particularly the PLO. 
  Hafiz al-Asad believes that through this approach, he will 
gain America, and if he gains America, he will receive some 
material and political privileges that he could not achieve 
through face-to-face talks with the Zionists; in other words, he 
wants to reach Israel via America, not the opposite. He also 
wants America alone to help him obtain European and Western 
assistance. Moreover, he wants America to help him obtain Gulf 
assistance and donations. 
  This does not mean that eventually Hafiz al-Asad will not 
announce his (?submission to Zionism) which has become a fact, 
because his agreement with America and his concessions, for the 
sake of America, will be in the interest of Israel. 
Normalization is in the interest of Israel. Joint, bilateral, 
regional, and international cooperation on political, security, 
and economic levels is in the interest of Israel. 
  Hafiz al-Asad is eager to gain what al-Sadat and Yasir 
'Arafat have gained. He maneuvers, however, to achieve this 
over a longer period and for a higher price, or so he imagines.

  [Text] Zakho, Jan 4 (AFP)--Lord Archer arrived Tuesday [4 
January] in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq where he will 
address the breakaway parliament and deliver a message from 
Prime Minister John Major, an AFP correspondent reported. 
  Lord Archer, better known as the novelist Jeffrey Archer, 
arrived at the head of an eight-member delegation including 
Catherine Royal, head of the Foreign Office's Iraq desk. They 
plan to stay in the region for five days. He will address the 
parliament in Irbil on Wednesday and deliver a message from 
Major, whose contents he did not disclose. The delegation was 
staying Tuesday at the allied military coordination centre in 
Zakho. 
  Lord Archer said he wanted to see how the situation in 
Kurdistan had developed since his last visit a year ago, and to 
discuss aid. The Kurds set up their own government and 
parliament in northern Iraq after the Gulf war and are protected 
by allied warplanes patrolling an "exclusion zone" closed to 
President Saddam Husayn's aircraft.

  [Text] Damascus, 30 Dec (SANA)--The Iraqi Islamic bloc, 
which opposes the Iraqi regime, has stressed its desire to bring 
down the Baghdad regime and set up an alternative regime in a 
united Iraq that respects the rights of all parties. In a 
statement issued today, the Islamic bloc noted the need to 
defend the unity of Iraq's people and entity as an objective in 
the interests of all parties in Iraq. The Islamic bloc called 
for rejecting any plans or policies that would fragment or 
divide Iraq. 
  The statement calls for the setting up of an alternative 
regime in Iraq that respects human rights, particularly the 
right to free expression, as stipulated in all laws, religions, 
and international charters. 
  The Iraqi Islamic bloc added that America wants to use the 
Iraqi opposition to pressure the Iraqi regime, if this regime 
hesitates to carry out its orders. The bloc added that America 
will hint to the Iraqi regime that the opposition will be the 
alternative if that regimes rebels against it. America, the 
bloc said, will only enable the opposition to topple the Baghdad 
regime if it finds that it is more capable of achieving its 
interests. 
  The Islamic opposition called on the forces of the Iraqi 
opposition to be alert and cautious in their dealings with the 
United States.

  [Text] Iraqi Central Bank Governor Tariq Talib al-Takmaji 
has denied the tendentious rumors circulated by hostile sources 
on Iraq's intention to take steps pertaining to the Iraqi 
currency's value. 
  In a statement to an IRAQI NEWS AGENCY correspondent, the 
governor said: Recently, there have been tendentious rumors 
circulated by hostile propaganda sources. These rumors are 
aimed at undermining the legendary steadfastness of the good 
Iraqis who have proudly stood fast for three and a half years 
under an unfair and cruel embargo, which was imposed by the 
forces of evil and tyranny. These forces are still boasting 
about their defense of human rights. 
  Al-Takmaji added: These rumors include reports on the Iraqi 
currency. Some parties alleged that there is an intention to 
replace the present currency with another currency worth 
one-tenth the present currency's value. The evil ones also say 
that the state will possess 90 percent of the public's balances 
deposited in the Iraqi banks, as well as other vicious rumors. 
  Al-Takmaji continued: These rumors-- which are circulated by 
familiar trumpets whose approaches are well known--are not 
reasonable, and I vehemently deny all these rumors. I also 
affirm that there is no intention to influence the legal value 
of the Iraqi currency or change its denominations, knowing that 
there are rumors that claim that the government intends to 
devaluate the dinar to one-tenth of its value. 
  He added: On this occasion, I would like every citizen to 
thoroughly examine these rumors. After our perseverance for 
more than 40 months, the dinar cannot be devaluated to 
one-tenth, and the people can be assured about their deposits in 
the banks. 
  Al-Takmaji continued: Some people who circulate these rumors 
try to compare Iraq with some former Soviet states or some East 
European states. However, such a comparison should not be made, 
and these people know this fact better than others do. Even if 
these people cite the current exchange rate of the dinar, they 
are also well aware that this exchange rate does not reflect the 
dinar's real value; it is only a reflection of a situation 
dictated by temporary circumstances. This situation will 
inevitably change when the embargo ends, God willing.

<F P=106> [By Dr. 'Isa al-'Isa] </F>
  [Text] Baghdad--AL-JUMHURIYAH has officially confirmed its 
report that four European countries have indeed released our 
assets frozen in their banks. AL-JUMHURIYAH's report was 
identical with that of the Central Bank of Iraq. A responsible 
source said: "Yes, some countries have released Iraqi assets 
after receiving the approval of their monetary authorities. 
These countries are Switzerland, Spain, Greece, and Austria." 
  In response to a question from AL-JUMHURIYAH, the source 
said 
that Iraqi assets had been frozen in the banks of several 
Western, developing, and even some Arab countries. He added 
that the assets were deposited as current accounts to cover 
import expenditures and that there were other deposits in U.S., 
British, and German banks. 
  Regarding new measures for controlling the circulation of 
the 
U.S. dollar and other hard currencies in the market or on the 
street, the source said: On 7 November 1993, the Council of 
Ministers decided to establish limited companies to work as 
brokers for buying and selling foreign currencies in order to 
stop the confusion that has prevailed since the authorities 
permitted the possession and circulation of foreign currencies 
in Iraq. The instructions allow the company to use up to 10 
percent of its capital for this purpose. During the first 
stage, these companies will confine themselves to foreign 
banknotes, rather than dealing with other forms of payment; the 
dealings will be based on immediate, rather than delayed 
payment; and the company's commitment to sound dealings and to 
extending its services to its clients will make the process 
successful and have positive effects on trade and other economic 
activities. 
  Asked whether there are new instructions on transporting 
national and hard currencies in and out of Iraq, the source said 
that the current measures take into account the current 
circumstances facing Iraq as a result of the unjust blockade 
imposed on it and that the lack of foreign currency has affected 
efforts to meet the needs of the local commodity and service 
markets. 
  On the instructions of the Political Command, the Central 
Bank of Iraq has tried to ease the pressure on foreign currency 
by taking measures to cover basic consumer needs and to increase 
the demand for the Iraqi dinar on foreign markets, thus 
affecting its exchange rate against foreign currencies in 
parallel markets. The following measures were taken: 
  1. To allow arrivals to Iraq to bring with them the sum of 
1,000 Iraqi dinars per person. 
  2. To allow Iraqis to bring in Iraqi currency from abroad on 
condition it is declared on foreign transfer form No. 8 and an 
account is opened with this currency at a licensed bank. 
Withdrawals from these accounts are not permitted for a 
two-year period from the date of deposit. These accounts will 
receive the 15 percent interest rate enjoyed by similar deposits. 
  3. To allow Arab citizens to bring in their capital in Iraqi 
dinars for investment purposes in industrial and agricultural 
projects designated by the Ministries of Industry, Agriculture, 
and Irrigation. Iraqi dinars brought in for this purpose will 
be considered as operating capital and expenses for the projects 
contracted and without any obligation to transfer the profits. 
  4. In implementation of President Saddam Husayn's directives 
on 13 July 1992, it was decided to allow citizens to make 
withdrawals and deposits in their foreign currency bank accounts 
without restrictions and without their being asked to declare 
the source of these foreign currency funds. 
  5. In line with Paragragh No. 4 above, it has also been 
decided to suspend the provisions on outside transfers that 
required banks be contacted for selling purposes and for all 
provisions dealing with the possession of foreign currency. 
  6. Iraqis who have accounts outside Iraq are permitted to 
bring these funds into Iraq and open accounts in licensed Iraqi 
banks or to use these accounts to import basic foostuffs. 
  When AL-JUMHURIYAH asked about the measures to combat 
inflation, the Central Bank source said that the Iraqi economy 
during the period preceding the 30-state aggression against Iraq 
had come close to a balanced economy. But, the aggression and 
the unjust economic blockade have been a major reason for the 
spiralling inflation the Iraqi money market is experiencing.

  [Excerpt] President leader Saddam Husayn has ordered that 
the allowances given to the dependent minors of pensioners be 
increased from 200 to 300 dinars. A responsible source at the 
Ministry of Justice has stated this to an IRAQI NEWS AGENCY 
correspondent. The source added that the ministry made efforts 
to improve the department's performance in the care of minors 
eliminating unnecessary steps in the paperwork. This paperwork 
is usually monitored by those guardians who oversee the minors. 
The new procedures are meant to facilitate things for the 
minors and to assist in processing their application forms as 
quickly as possible, he noted. 
  The source added that this department implements the task of 
caring for minors, preserving their rights and funds, and 
investing their money in a way that achieves the best revenues. 
He pointed out that the minors' balance totals 1.0003 billion 
dinars. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad--Iraqi Culture and Information Minister 
Hamid Yusuf Hammadi has praised the brotherly ties between the 
Jordanian and Iraqi peoples. He said the Iraqi people will 
always recall with fondness and appreciation the Jordanian 
people's support during their calamities, both in the Iraq-Iran 
war against the racist hostile current and in the Mother of 
Battles when forces of evil and aggression massed and more than 
30 barbaric, treacherous states assembled to strike at Iraq. 
  In an interview with the AKHBAR AL-USBU' editor in chief, 
Hammadi said the reopening of Umm Qasr port in the Gulf will not 
affect the transportation of Iraqi imports and continued 
commercial activity via al-Aqabah Port. He said Umm Qasr port 
was operational during the Iran-Iraq war but this did not affect 
the flow of goods to Iraq via al-'Aqabah port in Jordan. 
  The Iraqi information minister said: The reopening of Umm 
Qasr port confirms Iraq's right to make the appropriate 
decisions and repair everything destroyed by war. It also 
confirms Iraq's determination to break the chains of the 
blockade imposed against it. The decision to allow imports via 
Iraqi ports will also encourage major shipping companies to ship 
directly to Iraq to unload the goods that are allowed to be 
imported. 
  Hammadi underlined Iraq's strong desire to continue to 
receive its imports via al-'Aqabah port, particularly the 
imports shipped by big vessels with a load capacity of over 
30,000 tonnes. He said even after repairing and expanding the 
port, and overcoming the silt problem, Umm Qasr port can only 
receive vessels with a load capacity between 20,000 and 30,000 
tonnes, particularly those arriving from Pakistan and India. 
The distance from these countries to Umm Qasr port, he said, is 
shorter than that to al-'Aqabah. 
  The information minister said certain shipping companies are 
worried about sending their vessels to Umm Qasr because they 
think the area between al-Bakr harbor and Umm Qasr port is 
dotted with mines and because of higher insurance costs. 
  Hammadi also talked about the Iraqi Government's positive 
attitude toward former British Prime Minister Edward Heath and 
other European figures who visited Iraq recently to secure the 
release of prisoners. He said: These people who wagered on 
the collapse of Iraq and who thought that its capitulation was 
only a matter of time have come back to show repentance and 
admit that the regime is strong and so is Iraq. 
  He added: We cannot turn back those people, who, we think, 
have begun to understand the suffering of and injustice 
inflicted on Iraq and the effect the blockade is having on its 
people. We responded favorably to them on humanitarian grounds 
and we hope they will make their voices heard to their 
governments and to the officials and people in their countries 
in the hope that awareness may move to end the injustice and 
repression against Iraq. 
  The Iraqi information minister praised the good relations 
between the Iraqi and Turkish peoples. He said: We sensed from 
the brothers in Turkey -- including party, professional, and 
trade union leaders and parliamentarians -- only sincere 
feelings toward us. We have trade links with Turkey. We expect 
an increase in trade links between the two countries through the 
thousands of trucks that enter Iraq with foodstuffs. They 
barter these goods for gasoline and kerosene, which they take to 
sell in Turkey. We hope these convoys will continue to supply 
particularly foodstuffs and medicine, to help lessen the burden 
on the Iraqi people that is caused by the blockade, 
  Hammadi adds: Some 50,000 people live in the Diyarbakir 
area. Cafes, restaurants, hotels, and resorts can be built on a 
120-km stretch of road to serve drivers and truck convoys. It 
is expected that between 17,000 and 20,000 trucks loaded with 
goods, particularly rice and legumes, will enter Iraq daily. 
Trade links with the Diyarbakir area date back more than 50 
years and Iraq used to import legumes, particularly good quality 
peas, from that area. 
  Asked about his expectations on the resumption of Iraqi oil 
exports via Turkey, Hammadi said: Al-Bakr harbor, which extends 
25 km into the sea, is ready to receive tankers and export oil. 
The harbor was repaired and made ready for work two years ago. 
As for exports via Turkey, Turkey alone can answer this 
question and determine the date. 
  Asked about lifting the unjust blockade and Iraq's 
compliance 
with the UN resolutions, and whether there were still any 
requests which Iraq has to fulfill, the information minister 
said Iraq has implemented all UN Security Council resolutions. 
He said it is time now to lift the blockade imposed on Iraq 
and we expect matters to become clear in February. 
  Asked about recent U.S. moves to secure a UN Security 
Council 
resolution calling on Iraq to recognize Kuwait and stop action 
against the opposition, Hammadi said: We understood from UN 
envoy Ekeus that there are no appendices or new conditions to 
the UN Security Council resolutions, which introduced and 
maintained the sanctions against Iraq. We will have to wait and 
see what they say in the next meeting which, as I have said, 
will be held in February. The blockade will, God wiling, erode; 
this is only a matter of time. 
  At the conclusion of the interview, Hammadi said he is proud 
of the position of Jordan--king, government, and people. He 
asked us to convey his greetings to the Jordanians, whose blood 
was mixed with the blood of the Iraqis.

continuously monitor the demilitarized zone. He said they will 
also carry out random inspections of all cars and vehicles in 
the area in order to prevent any attempts at sabotage or to stir 
up any problems. 
  The UNIKOM commander added that a security trench will 
prevent any individual attempts on the part of the Iraqi regime 
to breach these borders.

  [Text] Petroleum and Minerals Minister Sa'id Bin-Ahmad 
al-Shanfari has received a letter from fraternal Bahraini 
Development and Industry Minister Yusuf Ahmad al-Shirawi, in 
reply to the letter his excellency sent to His Excellency Yusuf 
Ahmad al-Shirawi on falling oil prices and the sultanate's 
current efforts to contact non-OPEC oil-producing countries in 
order to cooperate to achieve stability in oil markets and to 
improve prices from their current low levels. 
  In his letter, al-Shirawi noted appreciation for the 
Sultanate of Oman's concern over the current oil market and also 
pointed out that he supported the sultanate's views on factors 
that have led to the decline of oil prices. 
  Bahraini Development and Industry Minister Yusuf Bin-Ahmad 
al- Shirawi also invited Sa'id Bin-Ahmad al-Shanfari to visit 
Bahrain to hold consultations on the declining oil prices and 
the best ways to assess the course and trends of oil prices in 
line with the contents of the final statement issued by the Gulf 
Cooperation Council [GCC] summit held late last month. The GCC 
member states had agreed to contribute to efforts to reduce oil 
production if all the OPEC and non-OPEC countries agreed to an 
overall plan to reduce production in a balanced manner.

  [Text] Riyadh, Jan 1, (SPA) -- The custodian of the two 
holy mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz has approved the new 
budget for the fiscal year 1414/1415 H which begins on the 18th 
of Rajab 1414 H (corresponding to December 31, 1993) for twelve 
months. 
  The Ministry of Finance and National Economy is therefore 
pleased to comment on the current economic position and the 
financial program for the coming year. First: The general 
financial position: 
  The fiscal year 1413/1414 has witnessed a noticeable 
reduction in the international oil prices, and as the principal 
source of the government revenue, oil represents seventy five 
percent (75) of the total government income. 
  This reduction has affected the growth rate of GDP which was 
tentatively estimated at 1 percent for 1413/1414 even though it 
will be revised as soon as the final data becomes available. 
However, if we look at the private sector, the results are 
different since its growth rate was estimated at 5.1 percent for 
1993. 
  This growth rate is good and confirms the continued 
expansion 
of the private sector as well as the continued increase in the 
absorptive capacity of the national economy as a result of 
investments that took place in recent years. 
  In this regard, it is worth mentioning that one of the main 
reasons for this improvement in the growth of the private sector 
was price stability. The consumer price index remained low, 
indeed, for the last month of 1993 it was 1.8 percent, in 
comparison with the same month of 1992. This is a very low rate 
compared to what is prevailing in most countries. Second: 
Appropriations for the new fiscal year 1414/1415 
  1- as a result of a continually weak international oil 
market, the revenues and expenditures of the new fiscal year 
were estimated at one hundred and sixty thousand million riyals 
(SR 160,000,000,000). The size of the new budget is less than 
last year's budget by 20 percent. This level of public 
expenditure is made to be in line with the expected incomes from 
oil for the next year. 
  2- The appropriation for the ongoing maintenance and 
construction projects in the new budget is estimated at forty 
three thousand million riyals (SR 43,000,000,000). 
  3- The development funds will continue to provide loans to 
the private sector's activities, which will be seven thousand, 
eight hundred and seventy million riyals (7,870,000,000) during 
the next fiscal year.

  [Excerpts] Amman--Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah has said that the Yemeni Government and people are 
looking forward to His Majesty King Husayn's blessing of the 
national reconciliation between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. He explained that it is 
premature to set a date for this reconciliation, but added it 
will take place within the next few weeks, and no later than the 
end of this month. 
  In a telephone statement to AL-DUSTUR yesterday, Basindwah 
said that immediately after his return from his recent visit to 
Jordan, Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid 
Abu-Shawarib briefed the Yemeni Council of Ministers on the 
results of his meeting with His Majesty King Husayn. 
Abu-Shawarib also conveyed to the Council of Ministers his 
majesty's extreme interest in maintaining the scared Yemeni 
unity and the accomplishments that have been achieved so far. 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked whether other Arab leaders will attend the 
reconciliation ceremony, the Yemeni foreign minister said that 
His Majesty King Husayn will be the only sponsor at the historic 
meeting. He said King Husayn had a key role in containing the 
crisis because he is respected, appreciated, and loved by the 
Yemeni president, vice president, and people. [passage omitted] 
  In another development, AL-DUSTUR has learned that a grand 
official and popular ceremony will be held at the al-Jund Mosque 
in Ta'izz before the end of this month. The ceremony will be 
attended by the Yemeni president, vice president, and all 
official and popular leaders to vow at the home of God to 
resolve problems and maintain the sacred Yemeni unity.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Some Ministers' Moves Perpetuate </F>
Split in Yemeni Government"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa-London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Political 
circles in Sanaa have confirmed the existence of an undeclared 
split inside the Yemeni Government, which they consider an 
extension of the split developing in the Presidential Council 
and the House of Representatives as a result of the political 
crisis the country has been experiencing since August. 
  The circles' proof of the existence of the undeclared split 
is that one ministry does not know what another does, and that 
some Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] ministers are trying to free 
themselves from the so-called "Sanaa grip," especially as some 
of these ministers have for several weeks been living in Aden 
and other southern governorates. 
  Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah has 
confirmed the statement attributed to a Foreign Ministry 
official to the effect that the ministry had no prior knowledge 
of the Omani oil minister's visit to Hadhramaut last Sunday [26 
December] -- a visit during which he held talks with Yemeni Oil 
Minister Salih Abu-Bakr Husaynun. 
  The official newspaper AL-THAWRAH published this statement 
yesterday, saying that the Yemeni Foreign Ministry had received 
a memorandum from the Omani Embassy, seeking assistance to allow 
the "private" plane carrying the Omani minister to land at 
al-Riyan airport in Hadhramaut. 
  The statement also said that the ministry had known nothing 
about the visit, and the same applies to Transport Minister 
Salih 'Ubayd Ahmad's travel to Cairo to attend the Arab 
transport ministers' conference. Sources have told AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT that the statement in question was made in reply to 
Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas statements about the 
two visits when he "confirmed" the Foreign Ministry's knowledge 
of them. 
  A General People's Congress source has told AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT 
that the oil and mineral resources minister and the transport 
minister (who represent the YSP in the present coalition 
government) did something unusual. The source added: It is 
logical and natural for all foreign contacts with fraternal or 
friendly states to be conducted via the Foreign Ministry, 
because it is the country's main contact channel, as is the case 
in all states. [passage omitted] 
  Sources following the situation have linked what happened to 
recent reports about continued attempts by a number of YSP 
ministers, especially those who have for several week been 
living in Aden, to free themselves from "Sanaa's grip." 
  The sources said that these ministers' nonparticipation in 
regular government meetings since the Aden meeting held in 
October -- even though most of these meetings are chaired by 
Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas -- is evidence of their wish to make 
their own independent decisions, be it with regard to internal 
policies concerning their ministries or even matters concerning 
Yemen's relationship with other states. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, 1 Jan (INA)--Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar, 
Yemeni deputy prime minister and industry minister, has said he 
is optimistic that the current political crisis in Yemen will 
end soon, and that the country's economic situation will improve. 
  In press statements published in the Yemeni newspaper 
AL-THAWRAH today, al-'Attar said the political crisis has 
affected the economic situation in Yemen. However, detente will 
come, he added. 
  Al-'Attar disclosed that Yemen's foreign debts total $1.5 
billion. This sum includes $4 billion [as received] for former 
southern Yemen and $1.5 billion for northern Yemen prior to 
Yemeni unity. The Government of Yemen is currently holding 
negotiations with former East European and Soviet states in 
order to reschedule Yemen's debts to them. He pointed out that, 
apart from these debts, Yemen only has very limited loans to 
repay. 
  Al-'Attar criticized the policies of the Arab countries that 
invest funds abroad. He indicated that many international firms 
are operating with Arab capital. Trade cooperation between the 
Arab states and Europe has increased to 95 percent, while it is 
only about 3 percent among the Arab countries, al-'Attar 
explained.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "After Suspending Deal on Two Nuclear </F>
Reactors, Russia Cancels Sale of Third Submarine to Iran"] 
  [Text] Moscow, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Russian and 
Western sources said yesterday that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has "postponed indefinitely" the decision to sell Iran a 
third very advanced submarine. 
  Mikhail Gorbachev, the last president of the Soviet Union, 
signed a contract to sell Iran three diesel-powered "Kilo" class 
submarines. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the Russian 
Government announced that it would honor the contract, and 
indeed delivered two submarines to Iran. 
  Russian sources yesterday pointed out that the decision to 
cancel the sale of the third submarine to Iran is justifiable, 
because it concerns an optional sale agreement, not a pledge to 
sell, as was the case with the two other submarines. 
  Russia decided early this month to cancel the sale of two 
nuclear-powered stations to Iran because of the latter's 
inability to pay their costs, as was reported. Tehran accused 
Moscow of "submitting to Washington's pressures." 
  The U.S. Administration spoke to more than 20 states, 
including Russia, in a bid to persuade them not to sell advanced 
weapons to Iran. 
  While Russia emphasized the decision not to sell the third 
submarine to Iran, Ukraine tried to win part of the Iranian arms 
market. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Zlenko said that his 
government has decided to supply Iran with spare parts for the 
Soviet-made weapons in the Iranian arsenal. He pointed out that 
Kiev has rejected the "improper pressure" exercised by 
Washington and is determined to strengthen its relations with 
Tehran. 
  Borys Tarasyuk, senior Ukrainian arms exports expert, 
announced that Iran is not one of the states to which Ukrainian 
arms exports are banned. He pointed out that only Serbia, 
Libya, Cuba, North Korea, and South Africa are subject to this 
ban. Tarasyuk pointed out that Iran is offering Ukraine oil at 
"very tempting prices" in return for spare parts and military 
technologies.

minister added: One priority policy of the Turkmen Government is 
to establish warm and sincere relations with the government and 
people of Iran. I hope that these trips and exchanges of 
delegations will result in the further strengthening and 
expansion of ties between the two countries. 
  Referring to the good relations between the Islamic Republic 
of Iran and its neighbors in Central Asia and the Caucasus, Mr. 
Besharati said: In the course of the expansion of commercial and 
economic relations, we should be watchful of suggestions and 
temptations by those opposed to the friendship between the two 
countries. At this sensitive juncture when most countries in 
the world are facing major economic and moral crises, 
neighboring countries should strive to solve the problems of one 
another. 
  Recounting the dangers of narcotics and arms contraband, the 
interior minister called on the Turkmen authorities to deal 
seriously with that phenomenon. He declared Iran's readiness to 
supply the experience gained in that field. 
  At the meeting the governors general of the two countries 
discussed issues of interest, including creating facilities in 
matters relating to border transit and visas, opening 
consulates, expanding railway lines, and setting up maritime 
communication.

  [Text] Ways of implementing gas and oil agreements between 
Iran and Turkmenistan were discussed at a meeting between the 
minister of gas and oil of Turkmenistan and our country's oil 
minister in Tehran on Monday [3 January] evening. 
  According to a Central News Unit report, under an agreement 
between the oil ministers of the two countries, Turkmenistan is 
prepared to provide the gas required by the border areas of the 
two countries, and to submit the results of technical and 
economic studies on pipelines for that country's gas exports to 
Iran. 
  At the meeting, possible ways of routing Turkmenistan's oil 
and gas pipelines, including routes through the Islamic Republic 
of Iran, were reviewed.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Mutual Ties, Better Than Expectations"] </F>
  [Text] The Iranian First Vice-President, Dr. Habibi 
returned home on Wednesday [22 December] after a two-day visit 
to Turkey. 
  At the Ankara airport the Turkish prime minister and Dr. 
Habibi enumerated the results of the bilateral talks, and 
described the prospects for the future of the cooperation 
between the two countries quite hopeful. 
  After the death of the late Turkish president, Turgut Ozal, 
in April 1993 many political analysts had expressed the opinion 
that the period of friendly relations between Iran and Turkey 
had passed away along with the deceased Turkish president. 
  This group of analysts focussed on a series of parameters 
which reflected the personal preferences of president Ozal, and 
arrived at the conclusion that mutual ties between Iran and 
Turkey were founded on personal factors and decisions. 
  In practice, however, it has been proven that the above 
conclusion is erroneous, and the reason is quite obvious. 
Common interests between the two countries are of such depth 
and range that no political leader in Turkey can escape the 
conclusion that maintaining and even expanding cordial relations 
with the Islamic Republic of Iran is a necessity in view of the 
national interests of Turkey. 
  It cannot be denied of course that there are many 
influential 
groups in Turkey that would like to function as the agent of the 
Western pressures of Iran. These influential groups are mainly 
scattered in the Turkish press and army. 
  The influence of the Zionists among the Turkish press is 
quite obvious and even the Turkish statesmen do not try to deny 
it in their negotiations. But the prevalent conditions in the 
world and in the region does not allow them to appear as final 
determining forces on the political arena. 
  The geographical region formed by Turkey-Iran provides the 
Europeans with the natural access to Asia. In fact political 
leaders in the two countries could arrive at early solutions for 
minor differences such as the presence of opposition forces in 
both countries, as soon as the leaders are able to view 
bilateral ties between Iran and Turkey within the context of a 
global perspective of political issues. 
  The propaganda campaign launched by the Western media last 
year on the supposed rivalry between Iran and Turkey in the 
Central Asian countries also proved to be a misconception in 
practice. Once again the realities of political life have shown 
that no fierce competition is practicable or even advisable. 
The Central Asian countries are so poor and so much in need of 
assistance, that there will always be scope for activity no 
matter how much is done in that region. Furthermore, both Iran 
and Turkey are facing so many economic problems that they can 
invest in the Central Asian republics only on a limited scale.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Turkey Extends Poised Hammer </F>
Mandate"] 
  [Text] The Turkish parliament extended the Poised Hammer 
mandate on Tuesday, 28 December. The vote was 196 to 160, with 
two abstentions. The Turkish National Security Council [NSC] 
recommended the extension of that force's mandate on 20 
December. The NSC's decision had to be supported by the Council 
of Ministers and the parliament in order to be legalized. 
  Poised Hammer, which was originally deployed in Turkey for a 
period of three months after the Gulf War, has been in that 
country for nearly two years. Obviously, the Turkish 
parliament's approval will enable that force to remain in Turkey 
for another six months. Recalling the deployment of Poised 
Hammer in Turkey, several political experts believe that it has 
a rather wide-ranging sphere of activity. They also believe 
that Poised Hammer can be used to strengthen Washington's 
regional security plan and oppose any move that might threaten 
Western interests in the region. 
  The Turkish Government has allowed the deployment of an 
allied military force on its territory to defend certain parts 
of its border and protect the Kurds against possible attacks by 
the Baghdad regime. But how can the Turkish Government claim 
that the country's sovereignty extends right up to its border? 
Is Poised Hammer's task limited to what has been disclosed thus 
far, or does this force have an undisclosed mission in the 
region? The Turkish people are in the dark about this, and 
opposition by a significant number of people in Turkey to the 
presence of the allied military unit in this country can be 
viewed from this perspective. 
  Some 69.37 percent of the respondents in a public opinion 
poll carried out by the TURKISH DAILY NEWS in Ankara last year 
said that they wanted the Western military units to withdraw 
from Turkey. Considering that nothing has been mentioned in 
connection with the duration of the Poised Hammer mandate and 
when this force's task will end, it is believed that setting a 
date for the withdrawal of this force will take a long time.

  [Text] Petroleum Minister Gholam Rez Aqazadeh-Kho'i once 
again called on OPEC members and non-OPEC producers to reduce 
oil production to confront the oil price drop crisis. Aqazadeh 
pointed out that the Islamic Republic of Iran is ready for any 
kind of cooperation with other OPEC members. 
  According to a report by our correspondent in Rasht, the 
petroleum minister proposed that OPEC production be reduced by 
four to five percent. 
  An IRNA report mentions that the petroleum minister said 
OPEC 
and non-OPEC members' overproduction is the main factor in the 
decreasing trend of oil prices, but at the same time added that 
behind-the-scenes political issues have also contributed to the 
current oil price crisis. 
  Aqazadeh added that during the first six months of the 
current year, average oil prices were above $16 and it was 
expected that they go even higher during the winter. But that 
failed to happen, which is not normal.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] Oil prices continue to fall steadily. During 
last Wednesday's [29 December] exchanges in European markets, 
the price of all varieties of crude oil fell to its lowest level 
in the last five years. [passage omitted] 
  The West's double standard with regard to international 
trade 
is quite clear. On the one hand, the West has invariably called 
for lifting tariffs and restrictions and has promoted the notion 
of free trade; on the other hand, by imposing heavy tariffs on 
fossil fuels, it has violated the most fundamental principle of 
free trade. 
  Some economic analysts believe that at present, the 
countries 
of the Middle East region can bring their economies out of the 
present vulnerability only by ending their reliance on income 
generated by a single product and expanding their sources of 
foreign exchange earnings. 
  The members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC], 
together with Iran and Iraq, can form a powerful alliance in 
connection with the oil issue. Due to their common cultural and 
historical traits and their good understanding of production 
capacities, and also in view of the fact that they hold control 
over the most vital source of energy for the industrial 
countries of the world, these states are able to deal with the 
harmful policies of Europe and America with regards to gasoline. 
They can, perhaps, impose heavy tariffs on European and 
American products, thereby making amends for part of of the 
losses incurred by the fall in oil prices. 
  In the same way that the Western world waged a devious 
confrontation against the oil-producing countries in 1973, now 
is the time for the OPEC member states to pave the way for real 
growth without reliance on oil income. The OPEC member states 
can achieve this growth by transforming their production 
structures, lessening their reliance on income generated by oil, 
and finally, by enhancing the rich culture of work and 
contentment -- which are, after all, characteristics present in 
Islamic countries. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The growth in the consumption of natural gas in the 
state is three times that envisaged in the first development 
plan. 
  On the eve of commissioning several important gas projects 
in 
the northern cities of the country, as well a new unit becoming 
operational in the Cangan gas refinery, Petroleum Minister 
Aqazadeh-Kho'i, in an interview with the Central News Unit of 
the Voice and Vision, said: At the moment, 105 million cubic 
meters of gas per day are being refined and consumed throughout 
the country. With a new unit being commissioned in the Cangan 
gas refinery within the next few days, which will have a 
capacity of 10 million cubic meters, the state capacity for 
producing and refining gas will be increased to 115 million 
cubic meters per day. 
  The oil minister added: The extent of the daily consumption 
of gas in the current year [beginning 21 March 1993] compared to 
last year, increased by 20 million cubic meters on average. 
That is an increase of about 20 percent. 
  He said that the amount of gas that can be supplied to power 
stations is a maximum of 20-30 million cubic meters per day and 
the trend of supply has been better than in past years. He 
added: Gas consumption in state power stations is greater than 
supply, and the shortfall is made up by liquid fuels such as 
fuel oil and diesel oil. 
  The oil minister described the amount of liquid fuel stored 
at power stations to be satisfactory, and pointed out that with 
the cooperation of the Ministry of Power approximately 400 
million liters of fuel oil have been stored in power stations 
during spring and summer. However, this does not mean a uniform 
regulation of stored fuel in all the stations -- when there is a 
large temperature drop and fuel consumption in Tehran increases, 
gas production does not meet the total state consumption. 
Therefore, in some stations, diesel oil has to be used instead 
of gas. 
  Regarding gas supply projects in the country, the oil 
minister said: In the first development plan more than 100 
cities joined the gas network. Cities connected to the gas 
network total nearly 200. The consumption growth has reached 
over 21 percent instead of the envisaged 7.6 percent. The rate 
of growth is fast, and efforts to meet gas supply figures in the 
first plan have been extensive. 
  He announced the growth of investment in the gas sector to 
be 
three times that envisaged in the first state development plan, 
and said: In the second development plan the same attention 
must be paid to gas investment projects so that all or most 
areas of the country can be supplied with gas within a suitable 
period.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] A number of Arabic newspapers linked to the 
reactionary countries in the region have for some time suggested 
that the Islamic Republic of Iran is very eager to restore ties 
with the Egyptian Government. It is nothing new to say that 
these newspapers have adopted Zionist stances. For many years 
the Arab reactionary countries have been funding with their 
petrodollars not only hireling newspapers and propaganda 
trumpets, but also the bullets that are fired at the breasts of 
the Muslim Palestinian revolutionaries. These hireling 
newspapers of the reactionary countries in the region 
occasionally fabricate news that Tehran wishes to resume ties 
with Cairo. 
  By publishing these venomous reports, international Zionism, 
which dictates stances to these agent newspapers, seeks to 
achieve several goals. Fabricating such reports is designed to 
suggest that officials in the Islamic Republic of Iran are not 
serious about their hostile position toward Zionism and that the 
desire to restore relations with the Camp David regime in Cairo 
indicates that they are inwardly inclined toward normalizing 
relations with the Zionist camp. Such moves would distort the 
image of the holy Islamic republican regime in Iran, which is 
one of Zionism's main goals. Another objective behind the 
attempts of these hireling newspapers is to dishearten the 
Muslim revolutionaries in the Arab world and to quell the 
confrontation with Zionism and the agent governments in the 
region. They also aim to suggest that the leaders of the 
Islamic revolution have reached this conclusion too, and so they 
want to recognize the Camp David government in Cairo, and, 
consequently, may reconsider their position on the Zionist 
entity. The third goal is to legitimize the Zionist entity in 
Islamic public opinion and try to make the international Islamic 
revival look like a futile attempt that leads nowhere. 
  Since we consider that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the 
base of the international Islamic revival, spreading doubts and 
despair among the Islamic public about this regime's positions 
is considered the most important issue in the Islamic world. 
Portraying the Islamic revival movement as futile offers the 
greatest support for Zionism. 
  Islamic revolution leader Ayatollah Khamene'i's unequivocal 
and firm stand on important international and Islamic world 
issues, particularly those dealing with confronting America and 
supporting the Muslim Palestinian and Lebanese revolutionaries 
against the Zionist entity that occupies Palestine, has always 
been the main factor in confronting and foiling the media 
schemes of the enemies of the Islamic revolution. 
  Regarding the resumption of ties between Tehran and Cairo, 
the Islamic revolution leader adopts a firm and unequivocal 
stand on this issue, exposing the true nature of this regime 
which is hostile to Islam and dominates Egypt. He defined the 
Islamic Republic's foreign policy to our diplomatic 
institutions. The London-based Arabic newspaper AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT claimed recently that Iran's first vice president 
discussed with Syrian officials during his recent visit to 
Damascus the resumption of ties with Cairo. The paper also 
claimed that the Syrian officials expressed satisfaction with 
the progress of these talks during their meeting with the 
Egyptian prime minister. The first vice president's office 
refuted these claims and said that the Iranian and Syrian 
officials did not discuss ties between Tehran and Cairo. 
  Naturally, adopting a firm and decisive stand on the 
traitorous Egyptian Government requires genuine faith in this 
issue; such a government will fall because it is separated from 
its people, is subservient to satanic forces, and is hostile to 
Islam. The foreign diplomatic agencies of the Iranian Islamic 
Republic adopt firm and honest stances in the excercise of 
foreign policy. Even Westerners themselves realize that the 
Cairo regime is dying and believe that the situation of the 
Mubarak government is very similar to that of the shah's 
government in 1978. By accusing the Islamic Republic of Iran 
of having a desire to resume ties with the Egyptian Government, 
the hireling newspapers and media that serve the reactionary 
countries in the region seek to save the Camp David rulers in 
Cairo from the crushing blows that the domestic opposition is 
dealing them.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Somali Quagmire and the </F>
Pentagon's New Temptations"] 
  [Text] The Zionist newspaper THE WASHINGTON TIMES, 
continuing its reporting on threats by pro-Zionist elements 
against the Islamic Republic of Iran, has carried an article 
alleging that "America is planning a conflict with Iran and a 
war with the Islamic Republic of Iran will be unavoidable." 
This newspaper, which has always been run by Zionist 
institutions and Jewish American shareholders, especially for 
the past half century [as published], cited a Pentagon official 
as saying: "During the past 10 years Iran has purchased 
billions of dollars of arms; and if we disregard the U.S. 
presence in the Persian Gulf, Iran is today the most powerful 
military strength in the Persian Gulf." 
  Such views and comments precisely reflect efforts by a large 
segment of the Zionist officials in the U.S. ruling system to 
create tension in the Persian Gulf and to prepare the necessary 
grounds for a new adventurism in the Middle East. 
  The article in the Zionist newspaper THE WASHINGTON TIMES 
appears after a year of unsettling militarism in the Horn of 
Africa. After drawing in most of their Asian and European 
allies and treating the United Nations like a puppet in their 
hands, the Americans are disgracefully trying to save themselves 
from the Somali quagmire. THE WASHINGTON TIMES article comes at 
a time when Secretary of Defense Les Aspin has resigned in view 
of the defeat of America's unrestrained diplomacy in Somalia and 
when, under the crushing pressures of American public opinion, 
the President had no alternative but to immediately accept his 
resignation. 
  This is one side of the coin. But the other side should be 
sought in the torturing loneliness that America is facing in its 
confrontation with the Islamic revolution. The Zionist circles' 
propaganda in America is a reflection of the failure that 
America has constantly met when seeking Europe's cooperation in 
confronting the Islamic revolution. 
  At least before the U.S. presidential elections, some 
political analysts believed that such American pressures on its 
allies to encourage them to side with America against the 
Islamic Republic of Iran was only the policy of the Republicans 
and that the Democrats were not as insistent as the Republicans 
on this. But now it has become clear that basically such 
methods constitute American policy in general and not the policy 
of either Bush or Clinton in particular. In other words, from 
the point of view of the White House, hostility to the Islamic 
Republic of Iran is not a tactic but a strategy. 
  America's strategy is to portray Islamic Iran as a regional 
and world threat; and they use the tactic of saying that the 
Islamic Republic of Iran is a threat to the region, to its 
neighbors, and to world peace and security, and that it should 
be confronted. The Americans believe that through this policy 
they can apply all-around economic, political, and especially 
military pressure and thus hinder Iran's economic growth. 
  The 15-year experience of hostile American stances 
vis-a-vis the Islamic revolution and, especially, the eight-year 
experience of the oppressive and imposed war against the Islamic 
Republic of Iran were testimony to two realities. The first one 
is that in a world filled with profit-seeking economic rivalries 
and competitions, the breaking down of economic, political, or 
military walls and neutralizing hegemonistic plots is not a 
complicated matter; the other fact is that there is a basic 
necessity for a country in a region which has been the scene of 
American-made crises for a decade to strengthen its defensive 
structure and strive to achieve military and economic 
self-sufficiency. Under such conditions, the Islamic Republic 
of Iran cannot be indifferent to issues that are directly linked 
to the country's fate and the independence, freedom, territorial 
integrity, and security of its people. Therefore, during both 
the war and the so-called era of sanctions and today, our 
efforts have always been aimed at seriously preserving our 
military and operational skills and power and our economic 
growth. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran wants to achieve a degree of 
economic and military strength where no one could be tempted to 
start a fresh show of strength and mischief in the region. And 
precisely because of this, the belief is that the stronger the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's combat ability and economy are, the 
more regional peace and stability will benefit, and that this is 
the only way that it can maintain its effective role in 
preserving regional security. This is a reality of which the 
Western world on the one hand and the regional Arab rulers on 
the other are aware, despite their propaganda. The Zionist 
circles in America are concerned precisely because they know 
that with the increasing defensive capability of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, the White House's plans to create chaos in the 
region will be foiled. If the regional countries are realistic 
and look at past history and regard their situation with 
insight, then they will accept this reality more confidently and 
will realize that the greater the military strength of Iran, as 
the guardian of the longest borders in the Persian Gulf, the 
more efficient security in the region will be. 
  The Americans are trying to put economic, military, and 
political pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran specifically 
at the Middle East regional level and are pursuing two major 
objectives in this process. One is to portray Iran as a threat 
and thus to pave the way for their continued illegal presence in 
the region and the continued dependence of regional Arab 
countries on them; the other is to promote more arms sales. 
Thus, on the one hand the return flow of the astronomical sums 
from purchases of Persian Gulf oil back into the pockets of 
American banks will be ensured, and on the other hand, the 
arming of regional regimes will create favorable conditions for 
Israel to make excessive demands. 
  It should be noted that some time after the oil war, the 
United States sold billions of dollars of arms--quantities 
unprecedented in U.S. history--to the regional Arab countries on 
the pretext of creating a balance in the Persian Gulf and 
through its extensive propaganda about the Iranian threat. 
  Nevertheless, the experience of the past 15 years have 
proven 
that neither economic sanctions nor political, economic, and 
military threats by America against the Islamic Republic of Iran 
have ever yielded the favorable results that the Americans 
expected. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran has found its way in an arena 
that is filled with world plots, so such ploys will never be 
able to force a review of our stances and activities on this 
great nation that has tread the path of revolution and the path 
of integrity and emerged intact from the most dangerous and 
deadly plots.

<F P=106> [Christmas message issued by Ayatollah 'Ali Hoseyni </F>
Khamene'i -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful. 
On the festive anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ, son of 
Mary, the word of God, the chosen servant, and the great divine 
prophet, I congratulate all Christians, Muslims, and all those 
with faith in his eminence, in particular the Christian 
compatriots. 
  Armed with miracles and a divine call for human salvation 
from the darkness of dualism, unbelief, ignorance, and injustice 
to wisdom, justice, and divine worship, Jesus Christ was chosen 
for a divine mission and throughout his presence among men, did 
not hesitate for a moment to fight evil and call for good. Such 
is the lesson that must be learned by Christians and Muslims -- 
who believe in the prophethood of his eminence. 
  Today more than ever, humanity needs such teachings, and 
Islam, which completes the Christian tradition, has placed the 
call for the good, worship, and excellence at the top of its 
program. 
  Lost humanity, which has control over the endless power of 
nature through the God-given knowledge, is now moving against 
these very aims -- and this increases the responsibility of the 
faithful. 
  The dominant powers and governments, under the pretext of 
Christianity but in truth materialist and ignorant of the 
teachings and traditions of His Holiness Christ, have made life 
difficult for the innocent nations and peoples, and commit all 
forms of injustice against them. 
  The most tragic of these examples can be found in the 
present 
condition of the world. These include the unprecedented 
aggression of Serbs and Croats against the Bosnian Muslims and 
the continued aggression of the Armenian Government against the 
Azerbaijan Republic. 
  Undoubtedly the great powers, for many reasons, share the 
responsibility for these bitter and tragic events. 
  I ask the Almighty to shine his light of guidance on 
humanity 
and to give victory to the forces of goodness, worship, and 
justice against those of evil, ugliness, and suppression. 
  I should also thank my Christian compatriots for their 
stance 
regarding current events in the region and the world. 
  [Signed] Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i

  [Text] In spite of its talks with Pakistan on the Kashmir 
issue, India continues to indulge in gross violations of human 
rights and its forces are continuing a series of brutal 
activities in occupied Kashmir. They have martyred 13 more 
Kashmiris in the Bandipura, Baliha, Punch and Keran areas. The 
occupation forces also shot at a passenger bus at Keralahar near 
Baramula, injuring 17 people. The Indian forces cordoned off 12 
villages in the Uri sector and arrested several persons during a 
house-to-house search. The freedom fighters hurled hand grenades 
at the Indian troops in Srinagar, injuring two soldiers. 
  Meanwhile, protest demonstrations were held in several areas 
of Srinagar yesterday against the killing of innocent people at 
the hands of the Indian forces. The demonstrators raised 
slogans against India and shops were closed in many areas. 
  Pakistan Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan says Islamabad 
remains committed to continuing the dialogue with India for a 
peaceful resolution of the Kashmir issue and other problems. 
However, in view of the fact that the brutal repression in 
occupied Kashmir is at its height and human rights continue to 
be violated, Pakistan will not schedule any talks with India at 
the foreign secretary or any other level until there is a 
visible improvement in the situation in occupied Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan Has Full Capability in Nuclear </F>
Technology"] 
  [Text] The declaration by Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed, chairman of the 
Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, that Pakistan is among the 
few countries in the world that have achieved effective 
capability in all fields of nuclear technology is highly 
reassuring. Pakistan has achieved self-sufficiency in uranium, 
and only locally-processed uranium is being used in nuclear 
power stations. Addressing the inaugural function of the second 
science conference at Aitchison College in Lahore, he disclosed 
that Pakistan is processing uranium by itself and making it 
usable. There are only a few countries that are self-sufficient 
in uranium. Most countries import uranium to meet their 
requirements, but Pakistan does not need to do so because it has 
its own uranium reserves. Uranium is a metallic element that is 
used as fuel in nuclear reactors or for producing energy. 
  Ashfaq Ahmed said that Pakistan has been successfully 
pursuing its nuclear program since 1976, and that Pakistani 
scientists do not receive any external assistance or cooperation 
in this regard. They are fulfilling their scientific duty by 
utilizing their own resources, which is a tremendous scientific 
achievement. Pakistani scientists and technologists have not 
allowed the shortage of funds to impede their work. They have 
built several major parts for a nuclear power plant that were 
previously imported, and have not let external impediments stand 
in the way of the smooth operation of their program. Pakistan's 
first nuclear power plant was supplied by Canada some 20-22 
years ago, but due to international pressure it soon stopped 
supplying uranium, fuel, heavy water, and spare parts. This was 
a great challenge for Pakistan, which our scientists accepted 
with great dexterity. They succeeded in keeping the plant 
operational by utilizing local resources. China is the only 
country that has provided a 300-kilowatt nuclear power plant, 
now being constructed at Chashma. 
  Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed said that we are capable of building 
nuclear 
power stations. Nuclear energy is indispensable for Pakistan. 
Pakistan has no option but to use nuclear technology to increase 
electricity production, because it cannot meet all of its energy 
requirements by utilizing such conventional energy production 
resources as water, oil, gas, and coal. The country is facing 
power blackouts due to the shortage of electricity. 
  The nuclear energy chief said there are 6,550 nuclear 
medicine centers in various countries around the world, of which 
nine are in Pakistan. Several of these centers will be set up 
in the country to help diagnose and treat complicated diseases. 
The private sector will be encouraged to play a role in this 
field as well. He added that nuclear technology is also being 
used in the agricultural field, and 18 new crop varieties have 
been discovered. Ashfaq Ahmed declared that Pakistan's nuclear 
program is solely for peaceful purposes. 
  Nuclear power plants generate 70 percent of the world's 
electricity. France meets 75 percent of its energy requirements 
with nuclear power plants. There are 424 nuclear power reactors 
in the world. Therefore, there is no reason why Pakistan should 
be asked to refrain from utilizing nuclear technology to 
increase electricity production, improve health care facilities, 
and boost agricultural production. 
  As far as the question of rolling back the nuclear program 
is 
concerned, it is entirely a political issue, and the nuclear 
scientists have nothing to do with it. The Chashma nuclear 
power plant will start producing electricity in 1997-98. 
Pakistan needs several similar nuclear power plants. If France 
had not refused to supply the nuclear reprocessing plant for 
enriching uranium, Pakistan would have been able to set up 
nuclear power stations by now. In any case, the country's 
future energy requirements can only be met through the 
establishment of nuclear power plants.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Atom, American Concern, and Islamic </F>
Countries"] 
  [Text] The distinguished journal ECONOMIST has disclosed 
that the United States has decided to intensify surveillance of 
nuclear facilities in Muslim countries because of fears about 
the possible proliferation of nuclear arms in Islamic countries 
by the end of this century, and that it will take military 
action against them if they do not refrain from making atom 
bombs. Pakistan is the only country in the Islamic world that 
has acquired the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons. 
According to American experts, Iran is making serious efforts 
to manufacture nuclear weapons, but it may take eight to 10 
years to succeed in this task. Besides, the Islamic countries 
are so rich with oil wealth that any one of them may become 
inclined to acquire nuclear weapons. 
  The apprehensions of the United States and its allies 
reflect 
their thinking and logic. Pakistan has assured the Clinton 
administration in clear-cut terms that its nuclear program is 
meant only for peaceful energy purposes, that it does not have 
any intention of manufacturing nuclear weapons, and that it will 
strictly adhere to its policy of not transferring nuclear 
technology to any other country. Despite this, the United 
States is not ready to trust these assurances. 
  Besides Pakistan, the United States is also planning to take 
to task those Muslim countries that may attain nuclear 
capability within eight to 10 years, as well as those with the 
financial capacity to buy such weapons. This clearly shows that 
to establish world supremacy under the new world order, the 
United States is targeting Islamic countries by raising the 
specter of nuclear proliferation. Under one pretext or another, 
Iraq and Libya have already been U.S. targets. Other Islamic 
countries -- especially Pakistan and Iran -- should work out a 
common strategy to foil these American designs.

  [Excerpt] Rawalpindi (PPI) -- The Ambassador designate of 
Pakistan to the United States, Dr Maleeha Lodhi has brushed 
aside the impression that Pakistan is framing its polices in 
accordance with the dictates of the United States. 
  In an informal chat with newsmen at the reception hosted in 
her honour by the Rawalpindi Press Club here on Friday evening 
she said "they do try to influence our policies but we must not 
under rate ourselves." 
  "Despite all the pressure we will not let happen any thing 
against the national interest as our sovereignty is very dear to 
us," she added. She said many things which did not happen would 
have taken place, had we succumb to the us pressure. 
  She expressed her ignorance when her attention was drawn 
towards the reports that 500 US commandoes will come to Pakistan 
for joint exercises. Asked what Pakistan can gain by allowing 
the foes of Islam to use its territory for enhancing their 
professonal skills, she said "this question should be posed to 
the policy makers." She pointed out that the job of diplomats 
is entirely different from the policy makers adding that the 
diplomats are there to communicate and articulate policies 
formulated by the policy makers. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Islamabad -- To effectively monitor fresh influx 
of Afghan refugees, the government has imposed visa restriction 
on all Afghan national crossing over to Pakistan through land as 
well as air route. 
  The reason which led to this drastic measure is that in 
recent days well over 40,000 Afghans, including men, women and 
children, had crossed over to Pakistan. There were serious 
apprehensions that their number might further increase if 
effective precautionary measures were not taken. 
  According to well informed official sources the government 
has conveyed to Rabbani-led Afghan government the reasons for 
such a drastic action. However, the response of Kabul regime is 
not known. 
  Pakistan embassy in Kabul has also been apprised of the new 
policy and directed to follow a certain procedure before 
granting visas to intending Afghan nationals visiting Pakistan. 
  In view of the federal government's decision the 
administration in the Frontier province [North-West Frontier 
Province -- NWFP] has been directed to keep an eye on illegal 
arrivals from Afghanistan and "maintain the sanctity of the 
border". It was also requested that a record of Afghan 
nationals crossing the border every day should also be 
maintained. 
  The sudden increase in the number of Afghans crossing over 
to 
Pakistan is due to heavy fighting in Kabul and its surroundings. 
A recent report of the United Nations High Commission for 
Refugees indicated that a large number of those Afghan refugees 
who were repatriated under the UN umbrella have also started 
returning to Pakistan and are desperately trying to reoccupy 
their houses in different refugee camps in the NWFP. 
  Pakistan played a host to well over three million Afghan 
refugees during the Mujahideen's Jehad against the Soviet forces 
and Dr Najibollah-led Kabul regime. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In anticipation of the expected national conference 
at the end of January, many parties are currently holding 
consultations and making moves to coordinate stances. 
  Within this context, a meeting was held yesterday at the 
headquarters of the Movement for Democracy in Algeria and 
included representatives from the National Liberation Front, 
Islamic Al-Nahda Movement, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], 
and the Movement for Democracy in Algeria. 
  AL-KHABAR newspaper said in today's issue that preparations 
have been going on for about a week to hold this meeting, during 
which the preliminary document, prepared by the National 
Dialogue Commission, the issue of whether or not to take part in 
the institutions of the transitional period, and the issue of 
guarantees and the sides that would participate in the National 
Conference were discussed. 
  AL-KHABAR added that the participation of the dissolved 
Islamic Salvation Front occupied a sizable part of the meeting's 
time. 
  It seems, according to the newspaper, that these parties 
have 
formed a unified pivot to put pressure on the National Dialogue 
Commission when the multilateral meetings are resumed after 
tomorrow, Wednesday [5 January]. 
  Before the anticipated meetings between the National 
Dialogue 
Commission and the parties, the National Party for Solidarity 
and Development said in a statement, a copy of which was 
delivered today to APS, that the multifaceted crisis, in 
particular the political crisis that resulted from the 
suspension of the December elections in 1991, can only be 
treated through a serious dialogue between the authority and the 
three winning parties in the elections. 
  In order to make the National Conference and the 
transitional 
period successful, Bencherif's party [National Party for 
Solidarity and Development] proposes the release of political 
prisoners, the closure of the detention camps in the south, 
easing the conditions of the state of siege, and reinstating 
workers dismissed for their political views. 
  At the end, the statement called for achieving all-embracing 
reconciliation within the framework of the reciprocal 
compromises and the return of tranquility to the people.

  [Text] Tripoli, 4 Jan, (JANA) -- Voice of America [VOA] has 
relayed a commentary in which it attacks the brother leader of 
the revolution and distorts his addresses to the masses who 
rushed to receive him everywhere in the Great Jamahiriyah. In 
its commentary, which expresses the views of the U.S. 
Government, VOA piled accusations against Libya irresponsibly 
and without any proof. 
  JANA's political editor has commented on this. He says: 
This commentary could be explained on the basis of two facts: 
  First, it is a hysterical reaction to the huge 
demonstrations 
of anger and defiance that erupted everywhere in the Great 
Jamahiriyah, and to the scenes of the human flood in which the 
masses joined their leader, declaring the historic decision of 
the Libyan people to defend their sovereignty and right to an 
independent honorable life. 
  Second, it is an attempt to overtake and cover-up the new 
evidence that has appeared recently, which confirmed Libya's 
innocence to the accusations of the so-called Lockerbie case, 
and also to overtake and cover-up the exposure of the political 
aims beyond these accusations. 
  The editor added: 
  The irresponsible attack on the existing Jamahiri system in 
Libya is an attack on the options chosen freely by the Libyan 
people, and in which they have become the first people in 
history to declare the people's authority. This marked the 
start of the era of the masses in which the people can control 
their authority, wealth, and weapons, and decide their own fate 
directly, without being represented by anyone. 
  As for the quotations taken from the leader's addresses -- 
used by the commentary in order to support the accusations 
directed by the VOA -- as usual, they deliberately distorted 
these addresses and cut them to fit these accusations. VOA 
forgot that all the speeches that it quoted were made in public, 
were relayed by radio and TV, and the whole world heard them. 
  The U.S. Government, whose official views are expressed by 
VOA's commentary, understands, perhaps before anyone else, that 
Libya is innocent of all the accusations directed by the radio 
in its commentary. The American Government and the world know 
that Libya has condemned terrorism and no longer allows any 
organization suspected of connections with terrorism to be 
present on its territories. Libya has invited the UN secretary 
general to send a commission to confirm that Libya is free of 
any alleged camps for training terrorists, but there was no 
response to this invitation.

  [Text] British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has arrived 
in Israel for a brief two-day visit. Speaking at the airport 
upon his arrival last night, Hurd said he hopes to hear about 
the ongoing peace process, but he did not bring with him any new 
proposals. Dani Gur-Arye reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd 
flew from Beirut to Ben-Gurion Airport last night for his first 
visit to Israel in three years. He was greeted by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who said Israel is eager to brief 
Britain on the latest developments in the peace process. 
  Secretary Hurd said relations between Israel and Britain had 
been strengthened over the last three years. He said the Middle 
East peace process had gained a certain momentum, and there was 
no going back on what had been achieved. 
  Hurd was asked if he is bringing to Israel proposals to help 
get the talks with the Palestinians back on track. 
  [Hurd] I don't wish to suppose or lead you to suppose that I 
have in my suitcase some bright ideas on these subjects. No, 
that is not our role; that is not our role. If from time to 
time we can facilitate....[pauses] I've just had a fascinating 
dinner in Beirut with the three Lebanese presidents [as heard], 
and I will discuss that aspect also tomorrow. Maybe from time 
to time one can facilitate understanding, but I wouldn't put it 
higher than that. On the economic side, of course we are very 
interested in how the Israel-PLO agreement develops and how it 
broadens out. So that side certainly, but I wouldn't certainly 
cast myself in any kind of role of intermediary. 
  [Gur-Arye] Hurd also said he hopes to discuss other issues 
with the Israeli leaders, including Israel's trade policy with 
the EC. The British foreign secretary is scheduled to meet with 
Prime Minister Rabin today. He said he would also meet with 
family members of Israel's MIA's. [end recording]

  [Text] The Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has 
received at his office the Egyptian Foreign Minister Mr. 'Amr 
Musa. 
  During the meeting, they reviewed relations between the two 
fraternal countries, and developments in the peace process, as 
well as current international issues. 
  The meeting was attended by the Minister of State for 
Foreign 
Affairs Mr. Talal al-Hasan and the Egyptian ambassador in Amman. 
  Mr. Musa, who arrived in Amman this morning on a brief visit 
to Jordan, is also due to hold talks with his majesty the king 
and other senior officials on the Middle East peace process and 
several Arab and international issues, as well as bilateral 
relations. 
  In an arrival statement, Mr. Musa said he was carrying a 
message to his majesty the king from Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak dealing with the peace developments. He also said the 
message deals with relations between the two brotherly 
countries, and is part of their consultations and coordination, 
particularly at this delicate phase of the peace process in the 
region. 
  Asked about inter-Arab relations, the Egyptian foreign 
minister said he hoped the beginning of the new year will 
witness a breakthrough in inter-Arab relations. He added there 
is no need to expedite efforts to restore these relations to 
normal, particularly that the special circumstances which the 
Arab region has recently passed through barred the improvement 
of such relations. 
  On Israel's rejection to return to the Taba talks with the 
Palestinians unless the PLO accepts the Cairo document as a 
basis for these negotiations, Mr. Musa said there was more than 
one paper and one document which the Israelis and Palestinians 
agreed upon. He pointed out that these papers or documents 
should be submitted to the leaderships concerned to approve, 
reject, or amend them; and this should be the basis for 
negotiations. 
  Mr. Musa said there is room for agreement or disagreement on 
these points, or on some of them, and for reaching solutions. 
  The Egyptian foreign minister described the proposed meeting 
between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton due to be held in mid-January as an important one which 
will expedite the peace process in the region. 
  The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Talal al-Hasan 
welcomed Mr. Musa's visit to Jordan, saying it is part of the 
brotherly relations between the two countries, and constitutes 
an important development in the Middle East peace process. Mr. 
al-Hasan said the continued coordination and consultations 
between the Jordanian and Egyptian leaderships at this 
particular phase is an important and vital matter.

secretary made this statement before he left London on a tour 
that will take him to Israel and Jordan, as well as Lebanon.

to provide facilities for U.S., British, and French aircraft 
violating Iraqi airspace, noting that this poses a serious 
threat to Iraq's security and sovereignty. 
  Iraq's Arab League representative said that during 27-31 
December these aircraft continued to violate Iraqi airspace, 
taking off from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and conducted 
258 aggressive sorties. 
  Iraq's representative enclosed a list detailing these 
violations to inform the Arab League member states of these 
regrettable facts.

  [Text] Kuwait, 4 Jan 1993, (KUNA) -- A responsible source 
at the public relations department of the Interior Ministry 
denied today the statements made by a local newspaper, according 
to which the ministry would not allow nationals of the adversary 
countries to enter the country, even if relations with these 
countries were resumed. 
  In a statement, a copy of which was obtained by KUNA, the 
source added that the Interior Ministry granted residence 
permits to a large number of Arab nationals including subjects 
from the adversary states. It also added that the statements 
made by that paper were absolutely untrue. 
  The source also denied that any official had made a 
statement 
in this regard and pointed out that those nationals enjoyed all 
the rights and privileges that other people coming to Kuwait 
have in accordance with the laws and regulations in force in the 
country. 
  The source concluded its statement by stressing that despite 
the continuation of severance of relations with those states, 
the concerned bodies at the Interior Ministry were carrying out 
all dealings concerning those nationals without any exceptional 
measures. 
  Last Sunday, a local paper published a statement it 
attributed to "a responsible source at the Interior Ministry" 
according to which the ministry would not allow the nationals of 
adversary countries to enter the country even if diplomatic 
relations were resumed with those countries.

<F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati in </F>
Tehran on 31 December -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Christians should see how 
unlike Jesus Christ they are; how much injustice they committed 
last year against the oppressed, especially Muslims; how much 
innocent blood they shed; how many women and children died; how 
so many people were exposed to extreme cold and heat without 
shelter. What did Christians do in Bosnia? It is Christians 
who are committing massacres and genocide. They really want 
Islam and Muslims not to exist there. They are Christians. 
  Does that pope, who takes those stances regarding Israel and 
recognizes Israel, see what is happening in Bosnia, and what 
they are doing there? Of course, they are not Catholics, but 
they are nevertheless Christians. He should see what his fellow 
Christians are doing. There are some Catholics who act in the 
same way; they are not all that innocent of that sort of thing. 
  Then they should work out what they are going to do next 
year, how much corruption there is in those societies, moral 
corruption, financial and economic corruption, political 
corruption. Various kinds of corruption have penetrated the 
depths of Christian society. Are they contemplating reforming 
themselves? Are they thinking about bringing the growth of 
corruption under control? They are galloping toward doom and 
destruction, and they are unaware of it. 
  We hope that, God willing, Islam will proceed as fast as it 
is advancing all over the world at present, and before long, 
thanks to the blessings of this Islamic revolution and the blood 
of these martyrs, Islam will conquer those countries. [crowd 
chants "God is great," "Khamene'i is the leader," "Death to 
America," "Death to Israel"] 
  One of our non-Iranian friends who resides in Europe 
traveled 
to Iran recently. Yesterday he was telling me some very 
optimistic things. He said Islam is growing in Europe in a 
spontaneous fashion. The youth there are showing their 
inclination toward Islam by growing beards, while the women are 
increasingly wearing Islamic dress. It seems, therefore, that 
Islam in Europe is growing naturally. Perhaps these Muslims do 
not even know the reason for their inclination toward Islam, but 
what they do know is that they are enthusiastically interested 
in Islam. The attraction of the Islamic revolution and Islam 
has influenced them, and unwittingly they are being drawn toward 
Islam. The other side, the non-Muslims are resisting this 
trend. But the more they resist, the stronger the Muslims will 
become. 
  He also said that the imam's decree on Salman Rushdie, and 
the shameful stances adopted by Europe toward the issue, has 
made Islam grow. These issues have caused a rejuvenation of 
Islamic spirit in Europe at a time when the European Muslims had 
all but forgotten their identity. 
  Our friend said that in Europe there are about 30 million 
Muslims, who came to that continent from various countries and 
faced degradation, ignorance, and suppression. They were fast 
losing their identity, and although they were Muslims, they had 
very little Islamic integrity in themselves. When the Salman 
Rushdie affair occurred and the imam issued his decree, these 
Muslims suddenly recovered their forgotten existence. They 
returned to their origins, and found out once again what Islam 
is all about. The women became intensely interested in Islamic 
dress. This was to such an extent that certain governmental 
organs said they would not employ women wearing Islamic dress. 
This caused the Muslim women to protest and ask: What do you 
exactly require? If you want specialized knowledge, expertise, 
and academic qualifications, we possess them all. What 
inadequacy do you find in us that induces you to reject us? 
  This issue in itself has turned into something which on the 
one hand has brought disgrace to the governments, and on the 
other hand has served to strengthen the resolve of the Muslims. 
This is the process which is currently in progress in Europe. 
  In the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina, no matter how much they 
try to cover up the atrocities, they will not remain hidden. 
The people are beginning to understand what is being wreaked on 
Muslims. They are understanding that the problem is over Islam. 
Let me tell you this on the occasion of this very week in which 
relief was going to be collected for the Muslims of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The issue there is not that of a group of 
hungry Muslims. It is quite right that they are hungry; it is 
quite right that they are living under the hardest conditions 
from the point of view of the cold weather and shortage of fuel; 
that they are living under astronomical high prices. All that 
is correct. But if we give assistance and say that one must 
help it is not merely because they are hungry, unclothed, and 
cold; it is because of the issue of Islam and atheism [kofr]. 
That is, there Islam and atheism are confronting each other. 
And they have resisted bravely for 20 months, are still 
resisting, and have not yet surrendered. Bravo to those people; 
bravo to that Islam which has given them so much strength! In 
that situation we say that Islam must be helped. They want 
Islam to cease to be. If those very people, the Bosnian 
Muslims, let their Islam go and say they no longer want to be 
Muslims, that they have an ethnicity and nationality that goes 
beyond Islam, just like you -- rest assured the problem will 
then end. Neither will Bosnia be dismembered, nor will the 
Serbs aggress. The international policymakers and the players 
on the stages of international politics will put an end to the 
problem then. But they are suffering all that because they are 
Muslims. We say that because they are Muslims Islam must be 
helped. The issue is not one of individuals and human beings; 
the issue is one of values. 
  What is being said is that in that same Bosnian war the 
people are coming to understand what crimes are being 
perpetrated. And what resistance they are putting up. And 
automatically the leaning of the pure-hearted youths there 
toward Islam increases and their loathing against those 
policymakers -- who have created that situation and given 
support to the aggressor -- especially Britain which is giving 
support in such a way -- will be heightened. 
  Let's move away from that issue as well. I hope all Muslims 
will be roused with fervor; all have a sense of responsibility, 
all support Islam and not be so negligent. Is it not shameful 
that there are more or less one and a half billion Muslims with 
all those resources while so many Muslims are being suppressed 
by a bunch of brutal Serbs? Would they not be able to put an 
end to the problem by working together? May God awaken them 
from their slumber. [passage omitted] 
  The position of Islamic authority should be maintained and 
the Koran expresses the same meaning: People should be in 
absolute obedience to this religious authority. [passage 
omitted] This position is the hand and shadow of God and is 
generally responsible for maintaining divine values. [crowd 
chants approval] And as Ayatollah Khamene'i said: Things that 
have been achieved by the great religious personalities 
throughout history, in terms of power, glory, dignity, and 
greatness for Muslims, were because of this absolute obedience. 
When an order was issued, Muslims would not hesitate; they 
would submit. It was the same with the imams, peace be upon 
them, and their followers. In the same manner, the Muslims were 
obedient to the sixth Shi'i Imam Sadeq, peace be upon him, and 
other imams, peace be upon them, and the ulema and their 
successors. 
  You have seen this and subsequent miracles in the 1892 
Tobacco rebellion and other events, when the ulema ordered a 
holy war. This must be maintained without damage. This is not 
a personal issue. It is not an ordinary human, governmental, or 
organizational issue; it is an issue of divine authority. 
Obedience to this authority is obedience to God. A sin against 
it is a sin against God. [passage omitted] Of course, this does 
not mean no one should not make any comments; not at all. Nor 
does it mean that the religious scholar or the just jurisprudent 
are sinless like the imams. Everybody can express his view and 
make suggestions. But obedience must be totally maintained so 
as to maintain the power of Islam and Muslims, so as to allow 
the divine authority to fight against the worldly powers, as did 
our honorable imam [Khomeyni]. 
  There is another issue regarding our honorable and dear 
brother, the president, who has been highly praised: Khamene'i 
has said that in this country, in the past 60-70 years, we have 
not had a leader as capable, honest, and sincere as the 
president. In all honesty this was lofty praise. May God also 
guard him for us. 
  There is also an economic issue, and I would like to 
concentrate on it. Ayatollah Khamene'i has said: Compare our 
situation with those in neighboring countries and see how much 
better we are. This is the truth. In analyzing our daily 
affairs we should have two perspectives. We should neither deny 
the positive points, for this would mean a denial of God's 
blessings and would be followed by great punishment. If someone 
has truly served, in whatever post, his services should be 
recognized and praised. We should also see any possible 
problems and act to solve them with all sincerity, honesty, and 
without malice. If we maintain the two perspectives, society 
will move toward well being, otherwise it will not. If we only 
see the good and fail to notice the problems and shortages, we 
will naturally error. If we only see the shortages we would be 
making another mistake. [passage omitted] 
  Another issue which his eminence mentioned and to which we 
should pay attention was that we should think of a solution to 
our economic problems. He explained the issues of production 
and consumption. These are issues that do not concern just the 
government or just the nation; all must invest in them together. 
Production should increase and there is no other way than that, 
and consumption should decrease and there is no other solution. 
If production does not increase and remains as it is, our 
situation will get worse day by day. If consumption is not 
controlled and does not decrease, no matter how much more we 
produce we will still engage in waste. [passage omitted] 
  If we stop wasting bread we will be $365 million better off 
each year. A great deal can be done with that, and many 
problems can be solved with it. A report also mentions that a 
third of foodstuffs are wasted in Iran. [passage omitted] What 
should be done about that? Who should observe such issues? 
That is where imports should be controlled, and that is not a 
joking matter. Why should luxury goods be imported? His 
eminence the leader also mentioned the same thing. Why should 
illegal goods be imported? [passage omitted] 
  Another issue is the control of luxuries, control of 
extravagance, control of foreign travel, and control of 
overspending, which should be implemented. Everyone is 
responsible. [passage omitted] 
  Of course, it is possible that some officials might not be 
aware of things. Not everyone is aware of the details. But 
those who know should feel responsible to confront the issue and 
also inform the authorities to say what goes on in such and such 
place; what comings and goings are taking place; what kind of 
entertaining is going on and what kind of travels take place. 
This kind of thing should be stopped and should be decisively 
confronted. When a decisive action is taken, a network begins 
operating to stop the implementation of that decisive action. 
The same corrupt persons have formed a chain; when one of them 
is about to be grabbed by the neck, pressure is exerted from 
here and there, telephone calls are made, letters are written, 
recommendations are made and strings are pulled saying that that 
he should be released. Sometimes they defend him saying that it 
is a disgrace to prosecute such a person. Is it a disgrace to 
implement justice? Who is disgraced if someone who has 
committed an act of treason is arrested? Yes, it is possible 
that someone might be disgraced. Yes he should be disgraced, 
but the grace of Islam, the country and authorities has been 
safeguarded and others will be more careful not to commit such 
acts. If there is negligence, all become bold. If decisive 
action is taken, all take notice. [crowd chants slogans] 
  On the same subject of prices, I would like to say one more 
brief sentence. Alongside all our other preoccupations, we must 
also do something for the low-income strata. Some of the high 
prices are inevitable, and nothing can be done about them, as in 
effect they have been imposed on us. No one, therefore, can be 
blamed. However, under the present circumstances, we must do 
something about the strata with no income, who cannot endure the 
impact of these bone-crushing high prices. We hope, God 
willing, these issues are taken into consideration when policies 
are being formulated. We know, of course, that these matters 
are being attended to. At the same time, prices must also be 
controlled, and people should not be left free to sell whatever 
they want at any price they wish. [passage omitted] 
  I wanted to say a few words about the issue of marja'iyat 
[the status of being a source of emulation], but I have run out 
of time. Very briefly, however, I would like to say I am very 
happy that the issue of marja'iyat is at present personified by 
His Eminence Grand Ayatollah Araki. We hope that, God willing, 
attempts made by others to take it to places [ja-ha] which are 
at odds, to say the least, with the system, the state, and the 
position of the guardianship of the Muslims' cause, may prove 
fruitless, which I am sure they will. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The seventh round of foreign secretary-level talks 
between Pakistan and India concluded in Islamabad today. The 
two sides held four sessions mostly devoted to the core issue of 
Jammu and Kashmir. 
  Addressing a news conference in Islamabad today, Foreign 
Secretary Shaharyar M. Khan said that no progress was made on 
the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir at the foreign 
secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan, as the two 
sides have basic divergences. He said that for the first time, 
most of the time was devoted to the discussion of the Kashmir 
issue during all four sessions. Pakistan maintained its 
principled position that a solution to the Kashmir issue lay in 
a plebiscite on the basis of the UN resolutions. The Pakistan 
side rejected the Indian view that the UN resolutions are no 
longer relevant, and it was made clear that these resolutions 
are as relevant today as they were in 1948. Khan said Pakistan 
is willing to hold talks on the format for implementing the UN 
resolutions, and there is no change in Pakistan's principled 
stand in this connection. He said for Pakistan, the people of 
Kashmir are the central players, because it is they who must 
determine their future. He said the Kashmiri people should be 
consulted first on this issue. 
  The foreign secretary said Pakistan's first demand with 
regard to visible steps in Kashmir was reducing the repression 
and tension and releasing the jailed Kashmiri leaders. He said 
Pakistan wants the Kashmiri people to have free and unrestricted 
access to the international media, human rights organizations, 
members of parliament, and diplomats. He said that during the 
talks both sides paid maximum attention to the Kashmir issue, 
but difference of opinion persist at the same level as in the 
past. He said Pakistan remains committed to continued dialogue 
for the peaceful resolution of Kashmir and other issues, but in 
view of the fact that the repression in Kashmir is at its height 
and human rights continue to be violated there, Pakistan will 
not schedule any talks at the foreign secretary level or any 
other level until there is visible improvement in the occupied 
Kashmir situation. 
  Khan said it is untrue that Pakistan is assisting the 
freedom 
fighters. He said Pakistan has proposed a neutral monitor of 
the Line of Control to ensure and to let people see what is the 
real situation on the ground. He said India did not accept this 
proposal and maintained that it will monitor the situation 
itself. Khan said various other bilateral matters also were 
discussed. The Indian delegation told Pakistan that they will 
be ready to present their detailed viewpoint on issues such as 
Siachen, Sir Creek, and the Wullar Barrage within the next two 
weeks. 
  Answering questions from the press, Indian Foreign Secretary 
J.N. Dixit said he held preliminary discussions on some 
suggestions which have to be considered by both sides, and that 
we will see how to proceed on these suggestions. He said 
despite basic divergences in views on the situation, we have 
agreed to search for ways and means to solve this [Kashmir] 
issue. 
  In the presence of Dixit Khan read a joint statement, which 
says both sides recognized that there are basic divergences on 
the Kashmir issue. The talks addressed all aspects of the Jammu 
and Kashmir issue and it was agreed that sincere efforts will be 
made to resolve it. Both sides stressed the need to engage in a 
meaningful dialogue with a view to solving all outstanding 
issues. The statement adds that the two sides will consult 
each other on the question of further talks at the foreign 
secretary level or any other level.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa by Sana' </F>
al-Sa'id; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Sa'id] There has been a great deal of criticism 
of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement called the Oslo document. 
Can the agreement lead to a Palestinian state? 
  [Musa] The agreement was one of the major events of 1993. It 
does not involve only Gaza and Jericho. It is a declaration of 
principles between the two sides and an introduction to other 
developments, starting with the transfer of power to the 
Palestinians and moving on to autonomy and 
self-determination--which means the establishment of a 
Palestinian state. 
  The development, undoubtedly, is important for 
Palestinian-Israeli relations and the Arab-Israeli conflict. We 
are currently in the implementation stage. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But the implementation is faltering. 
  [Musa] Arab-Israeli negotiations are not an easy matter. 
Given the long history of the conflict and the opposing 
interests and demands, obstacles are always expected. But with 
the determination of the negotiators and the help of other 
parties, the obstacles can be removed and the agreement can be 
implemented. The gap between the two sides, no doubt, is a 
result of the great hopes of the Palestinians and the great 
reservations of the Israelis. It is only through negotiations, 
the implementation of the agreement, and the demonstration of 
good faith that the gap can be bridged. This requires some 
relaxation, such as the release of prisoners. We must not 
continue to live under the same old standards. The rationale 
for the conflict is over, and we must benefit from the new world 
climate. 
  [Al-Sa'id] The issue of the border crossings is still the 
main obstacle. 
  [Musa] This concerns the two sides; we will not interfere in 
this issue. Ultimately, however, we do not differ from the 
Palestinians' view. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Some saw the delay in the implementation of the 
agreement, which was due to begin on 13 December, as a sign that 
the peace talks have failed. 
  [Musa] Moves toward peace have not failed. Both sides are 
eager to see that the negotiations do not fail. They agree on 
the importance of reaching an agreement. The delay in 
implementation does not mean that the process is over or that it 
has failed or gone backward. 
  The region has indeed entered the first stage of settlement. 
The Palestinian-Israeli agreement is important, but it is the 
beginning, not the end. It has opened the door for other steps 
on the Syrian-Israeli, Lebanese-Israeli, and Jordanian-Israeli 
negotiating tracks. But all this needs care, patience, and 
determination. This is what we are doing. The goal is to 
achieve a comprehensive solution that addresses the issues of 
land, rights, and security. 
  The Palestinian-Israeli agreement is an extremely important 
step, not a trick or a tactic to buy time. This is a 
psychological change. Anyway, the agreement will be judged soon 
through its honest implementation. The agreement is important. 
It means the recognition of the Palestinian people, the PLO, 
and the Palestinian land. If it succeeds, the two sides will 
live as neighbors, and fears and caution will disappear. 
However, this requires precise implementation. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But Israel objects to the establishment of a 
Palestinian state. 
  [Musa] No, this is not true. There is no objection to the 
existence of a Palestinian state. The agreement can lead to a 
state, and it will not be annulled by the establishment of a 
state. The PLO cannot be besieged and asked not to think of the 
great Palestinian hope--a state. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Which is more important now, the 
Palestinian-Israeli or the Syrian-Israeli negotiating tracks? 
  [Musa] At this stage, we are actively following both tracks. 
We are doing all that we can to stimulate the peace process and 
make progress on all fronts. This is a process that should lead 
to a full peace based on a complete Israeli withdrawal from the 
occupied Arab territories. It is up to the concerned parties to 
decide on a specific agreement with Israel based on all the land 
for total peace. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But do you feel that the general climate has 
actually changed and the region can now formulate new relations 
with Israel? 
  [Musa] The general psychological climate is obviously 
changing. All the parties are engaged in contacts and 
cooperation. We hope the talks between the Palestinians and 
Israel will end in an agreement that preserves Palestinian 
rights. We also hope that the resumption of the bilateral talks 
in Washington will lead to a peace agreement among all the 
sides. Peace in the region, with its political and economic 
implications, is a source of great interest to us. We are 
talking about laying the foundations for future cooperation. We 
feel a great responsibility. Things must proceed in the right 
way so that we do not go back to our previous state of affairs. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What about the Syrian track? 
  [Musa] We hope the next talks will produce positive results 
and enable the two sides to move closer to an agreement. The 
United States is playing a major role, and we are trying to 
advance the Syrian track because if there is no peace on this 
track, there can be no comprehensive peace. We support Syria's 
right to regain its territory. Syria cannot accept, and we 
cannot accept, any other kind of withdrawal. The implementation 
of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and Israel's withdrawal 
from all the occupied Arab territories will mean an end to all 
theories of expansion. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What do you mean by withdrawal? Are the Israeli 
settlements included? 
  [Musa] We mean complete civilian and military withdrawal. 
The settlements are part of this withdrawal. 
  [Al-Sa'id] How do you evaluate U.S. policy in the region? 
Some believe it upsets the balance with the Arab countries in 
favor of Israel. They say Israel is being supported so that it 
will dominate the Arab world. 
  [Musa] We cannot proceed from this assumption. This is in 
harmony with the language of today. The United States is a 
friendly country, and it is in our interest to be friends with 
it. It is not true that the United States is supporting Israel 
so that the latter will control the Arab world. On the 
contrary, the U.S. role in the Egyptian-Israeli agreement, for 
instance, is known by all. Under that agreement, Sinai was 
restored, and there was no Israeli domination. Such domination 
was not a price we had to pay in advance. It is not in the 
interest of the United States to let a certain state control the 
region. We are talking about balance and reconciliation, not 
pressure and coercion. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But the United States still adopts a policy that 
is essentially based on maintaining a strong Israel. It has 
recently supplied Israel with F-15 and F-16 aircraft and 
reaffirmed its commitment to qualitative Israeli superiority 
over the entire Arab world. 
  [Musa] This inclination is indeed reflected in some aspects. 
We are discussing this, and we view U.S. eagerness for 
qualitative Israeli superiority as serious. At this stage of 
peace, we must be interested in the theories of balance, not 
those of superiority. The region needs balance because this is 
what will boost security. Superiority, on the other hand, pushes 
the region toward an arms race, which is in no one's interest. 
  [Al-Sa'id] While Warren Christopher was touring the region 
in 
November, U.S. Assistant Defense Secretary Frank Wisner visited 
Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and the Gulf states. In his statements, 
he appeared to install Israel as a nuclear deterrent that will 
defend the interests of the United States and its allies in the 
region. 
  [Musa] Our position is very well known. We will not waver or 
retreat. Question marks and tension over disarmament will 
continue in the region as long as there is no balance. Peace 
cannot be maintained without balance. In order for this balance 
to be achieved, no side should be given privileges over the 
others. If the principle of preference continues, with only one 
party possessing deterrent weapons in the region, things will 
remain unresolved. Balance is needed for the interests of all 
sides. 
  [Al-Sa'id] On the other hand, a U.S. senator said during a 
recent visit to Pakistan that Egypt was pressured by the United 
States to abandon the idea of producing a nuclear bomb? 
  [Musa] I responded to him at the time, and I repeat that 
Egypt was not under any pressure to abandon the idea of 
producing a nuclear bomb. Egypt simply had no intention of 
producing such a bomb. On the contrary, Egypt has called and is 
calling for the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the 
Middle East. This is a principled position based on established 
Egyptian policy and has nothing to do with the U.S. position or 
the position of any other state. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But some people have the impression that the 
United States is pressuring Egypt to adopt certain positions 
toward some states and issues in the area? 
  [Musa] There are no pressures on Egypt from this or any 
other 
party. We follow and uphold the policy that we think is 
consistent with our interests. This applies to our position on 
chemical and nuclear weapons. Our positions are known and 
established, and there is nothing called U.S. pressure. Our 
policy does not stem from this or that country. 
  [Al-Sa'id] There are some who say that Egyptian policy is 
occasionally guided by U.S. signals that dictate the adoption of 
certain positions toward some states in the region. I mention 
as an example Egypt's position toward Iran and Sudan. Egypt has 
accused them of supporting terrorism and refused to improve its 
relations with them? 
  [Musa] This is nonsense. It is totally untrue and unfounded. 
No one is applying pressure on us regarding any policy we have 
adopted. We make our own decisions, and no one dictates any 
specific course to us. Generally speaking, it is not strange to 
hear accusations from here and there. Such accusations are made 
by a few insignificant voices. When a certain state--and I do 
not want to mention names--attacks Egypt and I respond, does 
this take place because of U.S. pressure? This is something 
strange and illogical. In our policy, we are always seeking the 
Egyptian and Arab interest. There are numerous examples, 
including our position on the peace process. But we might 
occasionally adopt a position that agrees with the positions of 
other states, such as the United States or the European states. 
There is nothing wrong with this. We are not bothered by such 
senseless remarks made by people who live in the past. We are 
not ashamed that our views are sometimes consistent with the 
views of the United States, the European states, or any other 
state, because these are issues of policy and not personal 
issues. Our policy, as I have said, basically seeks to 
represent the Egyptian and Arab interest. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Mentioning Sudan and Iran, some ask what basis we 
have to accuse them from time to time of supporting and 
exporting terrorism? Has their actual involvement in terrorism 
been proved? 
  [Musa] If an accusation was leveled, there must be proof. No 
accusation can be made without basis. But this does not mean 
that I am leveling a specific accusation against this or that 
state. 
  [Al-Sa'id] In your recent remarks about relations with 
Sudan, you said Egypt's intention is to achieve stability and 
not inflame emotions. What about Egypt's sheltering of the 
Sudanese opposition, and is this consistent with Egypt's 
eagerness not to inflame emotions? 
  [Musa] Egypt has always been a repository for Arabs with 
differing views. We have a large Sudanese community, a large 
Somali community, and brothers from all the Arab countries here. 
This is a very old Egyptian tradition. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Who is threatening Egypt's national security 
today, especially since Egyptian officials have said that the 
border with Israel is a safe border; the borders with Libya are 
the second safest; and the borders with Sudan are third safest? 
  [Musa] We are not in the process of selecting enemies, 
naming 
countries, and (?so on). 
  [Al-Sa'id] What is the current status of Egypt's ties with 
Sudan? 
  [Musa] They are not as they should be, but any issue can be 
resolved through dialogue. No matter what the relations are 
like, our stand will continue to call for preserving Sudan's 
territorial integrity. Sudan's control over all its territories 
is an important and vital point. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What about Iran? 
  [Musa] There are long-standing relations between Egypt and 
Iran, and the present tension can be attributed to political 
reasons related to the situation in the Arab and Islamic worlds. 
We believe in the need to create a suitable climate to improve 
the relationship, but we are still hoping that Iran's 
inclinations will shift away from issues that cause such 
tensions in the Arab world and parts of the Islamic world. 
  [Al-Sa'id] If 1994 results in a new form of Arab-Israeli 
relations, it is appropriate that we are hoping that this year 
will also see serious Arab reconciliation. 
  [Musa] Arab reconciliation is truly required and the Arab 
world must move toward solidarity and calmness. President Husni 
Mubarak is clear in this respect as he calls for solidarity and 
calm. There are moves under way, and we are trying to create a 
fertile groundwork to build sound inter-Arab relations. Iraq's 
clear recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and independence would 
begin to clear the atmosphere. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What about lifting the blockade on Iraq? Could 
this happen in 1994? 
  [Musa] We hope so. We also hope that all the factors exist 
to achieve at least the Iraqi nation's interest. Iraq is a 
fraternal Arab nation, and we hope it will emerge from its 
current dilemma. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What can be done for Somalia at present, 
especially in light of the United States' decision to withdraw 
its forces in March? 
  [Musa] We have demanded a clear-cut plan in Somalia. The 
cease-fire must be backed; the factions should be disarmed, and 
then a national reconciliation must be reached with the 
agreement of all parties. These parties should meet according 
to the Addis Ababa agreement, and the settlement should be in 
the interest of all the parties, not just in one party's 
interest. Since the U.S. decided to pull out from Somalia in 
March, we must act quickly to resolve this issue in the coming 
weeks. 
  As a state, Egypt is very interested in the situation in the 
Horn of Africa, which affects Egypt's national security because 
it is part of the security of the Middle East, the Indian Ocean, 
and the Red Sea. Therefore, we must have a say in it. The 
Ethiopian president has a mandate to follow the situation in 
Somalia, and we are confident that things will turn out the way 
Somali people want.

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Jan (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has 
said he hopes the Palestinians and Israelis will reach an 
agreement to implement the Declaration of Principles. He said 
numerous problems have been solved after signing the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. He stressed Egypt's readiness to 
try to help overcome the remaining problems if requested to do 
so. The remarks came in a joint news conference held by Foreign 
Minister Musa and the director of the PLO Political Department, 
Faruq Qaddumi, following their talks in Cairo this afternoon. 
He said he and Qaddumi discussed the latest developments 
relating to the peace process on the Palestinian-Israeli track. 
He said they discussed issues relating to Egyptian-Palestinian 
coordination, noting that Qaddumi will leave Cairo for Amman 
tomorrow to complete discussions on Jordanian-Palestinian 
coordination within the framework of Arab coordination and 
boosting the peace process. 
  Musa said the discussions in Cairo a few days ago were 
useful 
and very serious, noting that a paper containing the elements 
left outstanding has been prepared. He said there are numerous 
papers and ideas relevant to the remaining points and we 
understand both parties' positions. He stressed that the 
picture is not gloomy, because both parties are concerned with 
reaching an agreement to implement the Declaration of Principles 
signed by them. He said it is only natural that such a 
complicated issue should involve differences in views between 
the two sides, noting that numerous points have been resolved 
and the remaining ones are few in comparison. He said he 
expects the negotiations to resume soon. 
  Qaddumi said the goal of his visit to Egypt is to explain 
all 
the developments in the Palestinian arena. He said: Our task 
focuses on relations between the PLO and Egypt and on completing 
coordination and cooperation with Jordan and Syria, because Arab 
coordination is an important factor that will enhance the 
negotiating position and maintain the peace process. He thanked 
Egypt for its efforts and role in advancing the peace process. 
  Qaddumi said the PLO's relations with Jordan are 
distinguished and he described 'Amr Musa's visit to Jordan 
yesterday as important and fraternal, falling within the 
framework of achieving Arab coordination. He said there is no 
document of understanding between the Palestinians and Israelis 
but ideas for discussion. He said negotiations must continue 
and both parties should remain concerned with reaching an 
agreement, which should be reached eventually. 
  Qaddumi pointed out that despite his opposition to several 
articles of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, he is putting his 
hand in the hand of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, because 
differences in views do not mean division, rather distribution 
of roles. He said PLO Executive Committee member Mahmud 'Abbas 
will continue to head the Palestinian delegation to the Liaison 
Committee meetings. He stressed that Israel's failure to 
implement the Declaration of Principles on time on 12 December 
is considered to be a violation of the agreement. He stressed 
that the Palestinians insist on continuing the negotiations and 
on honestly implementing the articles of the Declaration of 
Principles, highlighting that Israel should comply with this. 
He called on the United States to exert its good offices as a 
sponsor of the peace conference.

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Jan (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid met the head of the PLO Political 
Department, Faruq Qaddumi, today. They discussed the latest 
developments in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. They also 
discussed Arab reconciliation, restoring coordination between 
the Arab parties in the peace talks and the Arab League, and 
recent developments concerning the resumption of relations 
between the Vatican and Israel. 
  Qaddumi said after the meeting that the Palestinian side's 
primary concern in restoring ties between the Vatican and Israel 
is that no agreement should change the eventual status of 
Jerusalem. He noted the Greek Orthodox presence in the city. 
  Faruq Qaddumi said the Palestinian side is studying the 
agreement concluded recently between Israel and the Vatican to 
make the necessary response. He stressed the need for 
continuing the talks with the Vatican so that Jerusalem's status 
will not be affected by the agreement during the negotiations 
with Israel. 
  Asked about the remarks made by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political 
adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, to the effect 
that the Palestinian-Israeli agreement is ambiguous, Faruq 
Qaddumi said the Declaration of Principles calls for an early 
Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and part of the West Bank. If 
Israel wants to prove good intentions it must effect the 
withdrawal process. Qaddumi said this withdrawal is bound to 
partially improve the stalemate in the negotiations. But he 
noted that if Israel does not implement the agreement it will 
mean that it has failed to abide by a basic principle in the 
Declaration of Principles. 
  Asked about the differences between the Palestinian and 
Jordanian delegations and why the PLO did not sign the economic 
agreement, Faruq Qaddumi said the two sides are brothers, noting 
that his mission in Jordan, which will begin tomorrow, aims to 
reach an agreement in this regard. He said Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa's visit to Jordan yesterday represents a step by a 
major Arab country to promote coordination between Jordan and 
the PLO, because Egypt's task has always been aimed at 
strengthening Arab cohesion. 
  Asked about reports that King Husayn of Jordan has given the 
PLO a specific time to eliminate the differences between them, 
Faruq Qaddumi said King Husayn does not mean specifying a time 
in the real sense of the word; he was urging the Palestinians on 
the need to reach an agreement in the next stage. Qaddumi said 
the Palestinians very much want to complete the agreement on 
future issues, especially as the negotiations will continue for 
a long time. Qaddumi said he believed that Jordan also wants to 
safeguard the Palestinian issue because millions of Palestinians 
have long been living in Jordan. 
  Asked about Palestinian-Syrian coordination during the next 
stage, Faruq Qaddumi said: We eliminated the past estrangement 
and recent differences because we understand that Syria has a 
big heart and adopted the Palestinian cause right from the 
start. He added: If there are clouds in the relations with 
Syria, we and our brothers in Syria can eliminate the 
misunderstanding. 
  Continuing, Qaddumi ruled out the possibility of holding a 
summit meeting between Hafiz al-Asad and Yasir 'Arafat before 
President al-Asad's meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
Geneva in the middle of January. He said a summit between 
al-Asad and 'Arafat could be held later. He stressed that Syria 
is playing a basic role in the current peaceful settlement. 
  Asked whether the Palestinian side can give more concessions 
for the sake of reaching an agreement with Israel, Qaddumi said: 
We have no more concessions to make. Israel must make 
concessions. He said that no matter what Israeli Prime Minister 
Rabin says about reexamining the agreement, he is the loser, 
because we all know history is not proceeding in Israel's favor.

  [Text] Ismailia, 4 Jan (MENA)--Awqaf Minister Dr. Muhammad 
'Ali Mahjub asserted that Islam is innocent of sabotage, 
destruction, and the killing of innocents and that some young 
people's attempt to justify their crimes as being a defense of 
Islam is a great crime against religion itself. 
  During a popular rally in Ismailia today, the Awqaf minister 
said that a stable Egypt that is influential on the world stage 
is a safety valve for the Arab and Islamic worlds. He stressed 
that Egypt's leading role in the Islamic world will not ebb 
because the country is greater than any attempt to undermine it. 
He said such attempts will merely serve to enhance its role. 
  Mahjub added that everyone must know that Egypt has no 
designs on others, that history is witness to this, and that it 
is only concerned with the security of its sister countries. 
  He urged the nation's ulema, in the name of Islam, to seek 
to 
unite the nation's ranks and protect its ideology, declaring 
that any negligence in this sphere is a crime against religion 
and the homeland. 
  Regarding freedom in Islam, Mahjub said that freedom in 
Islam 
means commitment and good behavior, not chaos and disunity. 
  He added that any attempt to slander religion is a call to 
dismember the homeland and cannot be termed freedom of 
expression. Mahjub said: Slandering religion is as unacceptable 
as terrorism under the guise of religion.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Fathallah] </F>
  [Excerpt] Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif has 
affirmed that there can be no dialogue with terrorists because 
they are a group of schemers funded from abroad, similar to the 
German gangs. Their objective is to strike at political 
stability in Egypt and try to weaken its economy. They hide 
behind Islam although they are a misguided group. The majority 
of the Egyptian people are Muslim and do not need guardians or 
someone to teach them about Islam. 
  He said that the issue of terrorism in Egypt is different 
from the issue of terrorism in Algeria, where the terrorist 
groups succeeded in getting into parliament. But in Egypt the 
terrorists have failed to get into the People's Assembly or 
Consultative Council. They have also failed to infiltrate the 
ranks of the Army, security forces, and large institutions. 
  In addition, the terrorist phenomenon in Egypt is different 
from that in the United Kingdom, for example, due to the 
presence of the shadow government and some form of Irish 
independence from the United Kingdom. 
  Al-Sharif said this in answer to a question posed by an 
African journalist about the parallels between terrorism in 
Egypt and Algeria and the possibility of holding a dialogue with 
the terrorists in Egypt to reach a peaceful solution, such as 
that going on now between the United Kingdom and Ireland. 
  During his meeting with the members of the conference of the 
African Journalists Office under the chairmanship of Mahfuz 
al-Ansari, head of the African Journalists Union and chief 
editor of AL-JUMHURIYAH, al-Sharif added that there are 440 
seats in the People's Assembly, representing all political 
trends. None of them belong to the groups that describe 
themselves as Islamic. None of the so-called Islamic groups 
have managed to get into the opposition parties such as the 
National Progressive Unionist Grouping Party, the Wafd Party, 
and the Labor Party. He noted that the Muslim Brotherhood are 
represented by only 12 members out of the 43 members from the 
Labor Party; and they succeeded only because they belong to big 
families and tribes in the rural areas. He said the National 
Democratic Party has given opportunities to people from all 
political currents in Egypt, considering that 33,000 citizens 
ran in the elections. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Jan (MENA)--The Consultative Council 
meeting today was the scene of heated discussions about 
democracy in Egypt. The members were discussing a special 
committee report on President Husni Mubarak's statement to a 
joint People's Assembly and Consultative Council session on 12 
November when the new parliamentary term began. 
  Independent deputy Muhammad 'Abd-al-Shafi voiced opposition 
to the committee's report and to the restoration of the system 
of appointing village heads and mukhtars. He urged the 
government to permit the rotation of power. 
  Dr. Muhammad Zaki Abu-'Amir, minister of state for People's 
Assembly and Consultative Council Affairs, commented on this by 
saying: No one could have imagined that a parliamentarian would 
speak of the rotation of power without also noting that this is 
done via the ballot box, not by a government decision. 
  He explained that political party activity does not only 
mean 
congresses held in public squares. He added that certain public 
and security circumstances might bar holding such congresses, 
even in the case of the majority party [ruling Democratic 
National Party]. 
  On the appointment of village heads and mukhtars, Dr. 
Abu-'Amir said the pertinent bill will be submitted to the 
People's Assembly which will then decide whether these officials 
will be elected or appointed. 
  Regarding a comment by Consultative Council Deputy Speaker 
Tharwat Abazah about the rising price of printing material 
because of higher tariffs, Dr. Abu-'Amir said that this decision 
will be studied again in light of recommendations made by the 
People's Assembly's Industry and Culture Committees. 
  Consultative Council Speaker Dr. Mustafa Kamal Hilmi 
commented on the point raised by deputy 'Abd-al-Shafi, saying: 
You describe our democracy as marginal. Now President Mubarak 
never said we have reached the apex of democracy. He said we 
are seeking to entrench democracy. 
  Dr. Hilmi urged the members to be fair and just, pointing 
out 
that during President Mubarak's term opposition newspapers could 
say no to his reelection without feeling insecure. The 
president accepted this broadmindedly and has met with those who 
said yes and those who said no.

<F P=106> ["Text" of letter sent by PLO Executive Committee Chairman </F>
Yasir 'Arafat to Stanley Sheinbaum, "a Jewish American leader," 
on 18 December in reply to a letter he received a week earlier; 
"service of World Panorama," Washington] 
  [Text] We went to a meeting with Rabin with goodwill 
hoping to find solutions to the outstanding issues obstructing 
negotiations regarding the implementation of the Declaration of 
Principles. Rabin came to the meeting after announcing that the 
declaration would not be implemented on the agreed date of 13 
December. 
  The agreement provides for the withdrawal of Israeli forces 
from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. Instead of complying 
with the agreement, the Israeli side only declared willingness 
to redeploy the Israeli forces in these two areas. So a 
disagreement ensued between us and the Israeli side and Mr. 
Rabin over two issues, the first pertaining to the party 
entitled to supervise the border crossings and bridges, and the 
second pertaining to the size of the Jericho area under the 
agreement. 
  The agreement stipulates that the Palestinians should have 
supervision of the bridges and crossing points, with a UN 
presence and Israeli coordination. But the Israeli side has 
rejected that, claiming the right of supervision for itself. We 
rejected that Israeli demand because it constituted a violation 
of the agreement and meant turning the Gaza Strip and the 
Jericho area into Bantustans or something like a "Red Indian 
reservation" with the entry and exit keys in Israeli hands. 
  We consider that Israeli demand to be an insult to us and to 
our Palestinian people's struggle for a just peace and for a 
historic reconciliation with the people of Israel. Furthermore, 
nobody would accept such a serious violation of an international 
agreement concluded under the sponsorship of the United States 
and the Russian Federation in full view of the whole world. 
  There is another disagreement between us over the meaning of 
external security. We have agreed to Israeli supervision of 
external security but we have rejected the deployment of Israeli 
soldiers on our borders because that would place us under 
Israeli sovereignty. 
  External security, as we see it and under international law, 
means that Israel would guarantee the security of our borders if 
subjected to any threat from any side on the grounds that such a 
threat would also be a threat to Israel's security. But that 
does not give Israel the right to deploy its forces on our 
borders as requested by the Israelis. We have suggested 
tripartite Israeli, international, and Palestinian patrols to 
guard the borders. 
  The disagreement over the size of the Jericho area actually 
shows the extent of Israeli intransigence. Under the Israeli 
administration, the size of the Jericho area was 720 square km. 
We have accepted an area of 340 square km drawn on the basis of 
a 32-km line along the River Jordan and a width of 10 km into 
the Jericho zone. The three bridges linking the Jericho area 
with Jordan are situated on that line. 
  The Israeli side insists that the area should only be 27 
square km. We reject that because accepting it would mean 
agreeing to live in a ghetto. Would anyone agree to live in a 
ghetto? 
  We offered to coordinate with the Israeli side on security 
matters to allay Israeli fears. They can use the most advanced 
control technology. We could also use international forces from 
any states which enjoy Israel's trust, such as the United 
States, Canada, Norway, or any other European state. 
  At our Cairo meeting we agreed with Mr. Rabin that no 
comments would be made on the issues discussed but no sooner had 
we left the meeting hall than the Israeli officials began 
talking openly about what went on during the meeting. That is 
not in the interest of our efforts to find an acceptable 
solution to these matters. 
  If Mr. Rabin believes that he has to look after his people's 
interests then we also must take into consideration the 
legitimate demands of Palestinian, Arab, Islamic, and Christian 
public opinion. 
  We want an urgent solution to these problems, and we want 
the 
Declaration of Principles implemented in order to establish 
peace for our people, the Israeli people, and the rest of the 
region's peoples, and in order to put an end to the Israeli 
occupation of our territory.

  [Text] Tunis, Jan 4 (AFP)--A delegation of leading 
Palestinians is hopeful that the PLO executive will agree to 
make the organisation more democratic, one of its members said 
Tuesday [4 January]. 
  "The atmosphere is positive, but we are expecting difficulty 
over several points," said Nabil 'Amr, an adviser of PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat and member of a seven-member delegation holding 
talks with PLO officials here since Sunday. 
  'Arafat, who is yet to comment on the proposals, has come 
under increasing fire for his autocratic style of leadership. 
  'Amr told AFP the debate on democracy within the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation "has chances" for coming out with 
results. 
  A change in the composition and structure of the teams 
negotiating with Israel over an autonomy accord signed in 
September in Washington was among the demands that could bear 
fruit, the Palestinian official said. 
  The delegation, headed by Haydar 'Abd-al Shafi who led 
negotiations with Israel in Washington before the autonomy 
accord, was to present Tuesday night proposals to the Executive 
Committee on how to introduce more democracy and change the 
conduct of the autonomy talks. 
  The proposals come in the framework of implementing nine 
points included in a memorandum signed by 120 prominent 
Palestinian personalities and sent to 'Arafat last month. 
  Several Palestinian officials said that most of the 
executive 
committee members were for applying more democracy in the 
organisation. 
  But the PLO leader has so far commented only on issues 
related to the self-rule accord on which talks with Israel have 
stalled due to differences over who should control the 
international borders of the future autonomous zone, the 
security of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and 
the boundaries of the West Bank town of Jericho. 
  Asked on how to apply democracy, 'Amr said it was 
"premature" 
to comment on the issue. But he said he was confident that 
positive results would be reached, taking into consideration 
ideas of reform already presented to 'Arafat. 
  However, 'Amr said he expected some opposition to a proposal 
calling for the creation of a consultative standing committee 
made up of experts that would have a parallel role to that of 
the executive committee and help it "accomplish the big 
responsibilities it is facing at this stage". 
  Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab also expressed 
optimism. 
  There is no opposition to the call for democracy among the 
executive committee members. Some proposals have already been 
considered by the PLO leadership, he said. 
  Among those proposals, al-Najjab referred to a draft 
constitution for the future autonomy in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho which he said was currently being reviewed by the 
committee charged with following up the autonomy talks with 
Israel. 
  But other officials, close to the PLO leader, still doubt 
that any result would come out from the democracy debate as they 
consider the move itself a struggle for power only, rather than 
a call for real sharing in the decision-making process. 
  'Ali Ishaq, an executive committee member, told AFP recently 
that real democracy had never prevailed within the PLO. He said 
such an "ideal" would only be achieved through free elections 
for a "constitutional, democratic, independent Palestine".

  [Text] Tunis, Jan 4 (AFP)--Seven leading Palestinian 
personalities currently in Tunis to urge the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation to be more democratic last month sent 
PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat a nine-point memorandum of reform 
demands. 
  The following are the nine points of the document, a copy of 
which has been obtained by AFP: 
  1 - Creation of specialized councils for pursuing national 
action with regard to Palestinian autonomy and also with the 
Arab and international worlds. 
  2 - Calling on qualified people and experts to form 
councils and the planning and executive structures that depend 
on them. 
  3 - Giving priority to professional and political 
competence in forming working groups and negotiating committees 
and teams, eliminating favouritism and clan loyalties. 
  4 - Working out a plan of negotiation based on the text of 
the (Israeli-Palestinian) declaration of principles and ensuring 
complementarity [as received] and coordination among the various 
commissions and negotiating groups. 
  5 - Forming a supreme authority for guiding, directing and 
following up the negotiations process (with Israel). 
  6 - Forming a Palestinian Development and Reconstruction 
Council (PECDAR) based on specific criteria so that it should be 
credible in the eyes of (the Palestinian) people and the donors 
of funds for building the national economic infrastructure. 
  7 - Finalising the work of the (PLO) legislative committee 
charged with drawing up the basic law -- constitution -- of the 
national Palestinian authority in a way that brings out its 
democratic nature. 
  8 - Creating as soon as possible a supreme committee 
charged with organising a wide national dialogue grouping all 
Palestinian tendencies. 
  9 - Creating a high consultative committee of experts with 
a parallel status to that of the PLO Executive Committee, which 
has already been weakened by the departure of several of its 
members (hostile to the Washington accord). 
  In this document, the 120 signatories reaffirm their 
determination to make the Israeli-Palestinian accord succeed, 
and their attachment to the PLO as the sole representative of 
the Palestinian people.

<F P=106> [Salwa al-Ustuwani report: "Call for a National Congress of </F>
Opponents to the Agreement in the Occupied Territory"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- Four Palestinian factions based in 
Damascus, namely the Democratic Front [for the Liberation of 
Palestine] [DFLP], the Popular Front [for the Liberation of 
Palestine] [PFLP], the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front 
[PPSF], and the Palestine Liberation Front [PLF], have announced 
that they have a new organizational draft for the alliance of 
Palestinian forces. They said they intended to submit that 
draft to the meeting the 10 Palestinian factions were to hold 
yesterday evening in Damascus to reactivate the role of the 
coalition of the 10 factions out in the streets, in the field, 
and in the political arena, and also to discuss political and 
organizational relations with the aim of drawing up a joint 
political program and joint leaderships structure, as stated in 
a statement issued by these factions. 
  The new organizational draft of the four factions includes 
the following: 
  1. Formation of a higher central command of the alliance of 
Palestinian forces, to include two representatives from each 
faction. The command would meet once every two weeks and its 
decisions would be based on agreement among members. The 
command would draft bylaws to organize its work and would form 
the committees it deems necessary for that purpose. 
  2. Formation of a day-to-day follow-up command to include 
one representative from each faction. Its task would be to 
follow up implementation of the central command's decisions. 
  3. Confirmation of the previous decision to set up a 
national and Islamic command for the intifadah inside the 
occupied homeland, embodying all the factions which insist on 
the intifadah option and which reject the capitulationist 
agreement, to start work immediately. 
  4. Reactivation and continuation of the preparatory 
committee for the general national congress to mobilize the 
broadest possible front of patriotic rejectionist figures and 
forces, according to the following guidelines: 
  A. A call for a national congress in the occupied homeland 
to include patriotic, democratic, and Islamic forces, factions, 
trends, and figures opposed to the agreement, and formation of a 
preparatory committee of representatives of these forces and 
figures to make the necessary arrangements for the congress, 
from which a national steering committee for the Palestinian 
people in the occupied territory should emerge, and also to 
select representatives to the general national congress. 
  B. Full national and popular conferences in the camps and 
environs of the Palestinian people in the diaspora to choose 
representatives for the general national congress. 
  C. The general national congress shall combine 
representatives of patriotic forces, factions, and figures 
opposed to the agreement as well as representatives of the 
national and popular conferences in the homeland and in the 
diaspora, the aim being to continue the intifadah and strip 
'Arafat and his clique who signed the agreement of their 
legitimacy. 
  D. The preparatory committee, in consultation with all the 
forces and influential figures, should devise a suitable 
mechanism for the general national congress as soon as possible, 
prepare the necessary documents for that purpose, and seek to 
crystallize political and organizational formulas that would 
safeguard the Palestinian national struggle in the future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the </F>
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, DFLP, by 
Tal'at Rumayh and Mahmud Bakri in Khartoum in early December] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-SHA'B] What will the region's future be like 
after the Gaza-Jericho agreement? 
  [Hawatimah] I believe that the Gaza-Jericho agreement will 
not work out. It is completely and essentially different from 
the Camp David accords, which gave Egypt all of Sinai, including 
Taba, in return for its recognition of Israel within borders 
that are thus far unclear. 
  As known, we have been and still are against Camp David, 
because it did not achieve what it promised. The accord opened 
all the roads to the Israeli aggression and expansion in the 
Palestinian and other Arab territories. The settlement activity 
prospered all over the occupied Palestinian territories until 
the settlements now cover 22 percent of the lands occupied in 
1967. Settlements now spread all over the West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. They threaten to cover 60 percent of these areas. 
  That is our stand on Camp David. The Gaza-Jericho agreement 
does not even rise to the level of Camp David, which caused all 
these crimes. The agreement gives only limited self-rule to the 
inhabitants of Gaza and the town of Jericho, with no sovereignty 
over a single inch of Gaza and Jericho. It also legitimizes the 
redeployment of the Israeli occupation troops all over Gaza and 
Jericho after the evacuation of the densely-populated areas. I 
can say clearly that Taba talks that were held in Cairo involved 
an agreement on the redeployment of the Israeli troops in Gaza 
and Jericho, while keeping the settlements and dividing the Gaza 
Strip into four sectors, three of which are Israeli: The 
northern settlements, the central settlements, and the southern 
settlements. All these settlements are linked to Israel and the 
bridges and crossing gates remain in the hands of the occupation 
troops. [passage omitted] 
  [AL-SHA'B] You said that the agreement will not work out. 
What if its provisions are applied for some time and 
self-government elections are held? Will you boycott the 
elections? 
  [Hawatimah] We distinguish between legislative elections 
that 
elect a legislative council (a parliament) through which our 
people can determine their own destiny and the election of an 
executive council in accordance with the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
to implement the agreement and legitimize it. That is why we 
will not take part in the elections of the executive council, 
because its task is to implement the agreement and the exchanged 
letters of recognition. Such a council would legitimize the 
occupation of our country for a further five-year period. 
  [AL-SHA'B] How do you see the Palestinian situation after 
the 
self-government elections? 
  [Hawatimah] I can say now that Israel will withdraw its 
recognition of 'Arafat as a representative of the Palestinian 
people, because Israel, the United States, and the EC will deal 
with the executive council as the elected representative of the 
Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank. Hence, 'Arafat 
will be there to represent Fatah only or abroad to resume 
negotiations concerning the five-year period. 
  [AL-SHA'B] In your current position you rely on Syrian 
opposition of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. What if Syria 
supports the agreement or signs a peace agreement with Israel? 
  [Hawatimah] That possibility exists. This is one of the 
interests of Syrian policy. So far, Syria has announced that it 
favors a comprehensive peace and solutions and opposes 
independent bilateral agreements. 
  Syria declares that it favors full withdrawal from the Arab 
and Palestinian territories in return for full peace. This has 
been the declared Syrian stand so far. The Madrid negotiations 
and the Gaza-Jericho agreement have shown that the Syrians are 
sincere in their statements. 
  [AL-SHA'B] How can inter-Palestinian fighting be avoided? 
How can the campaign against the agreement be prevented from 
becoming a struggle over the figure of 'Arafat himself? What is 
your view of the fact that international balances of power 
impose certain conditions on the Palestinians? 
  [Hawatimah] The DFLP, the unified central leadership of the 
DFLP and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], the 10 Palestinian factions 
[who reject to Gaza-Jericho agreement], and the Arab Liberation 
Front -- which has not yet joined the 10 factions -- all have a 
unified position on the issues. The masses of our people might 
very well join this broad-based stance. Some other forces might 
also join the struggle against the Gaza-Jericho agreement. We 
in the DFLP have declared that the major conflict is between our 
nation -- represented by all its forces, factions, 
personalities, and streams -- on the one side and the occupation 
and the settlement policy on the other. Although 
inter-Palestinian differences are no longer minor, we must 
always put our conflict with the occupation before any 
differences among ourselves. All rifles, all stones must be 
directed against the occupation and the settlement activity. 
  We must solve inter-Palestinian differences through recourse 
to the people themselves via sound democratic methods. That is 
why we are proposing a referendum on the Gaza-Jericho Agreement. 
If the majority of the people accept it, we will comply and 
respect their wishes. If the majority reject it, then those who 
signed the agreement must retract and comply with the will of 
the majority. [passage omitted] 
  We oppose all forms of killing and political assassination. 
We submit to the people's wishes. If you are democratic, you 
must submit to the popular will. We have always opposed 
operations outside the occupied territories that were merely 
individual acts of showmanship because we believe that the 
people can liberate themselves through organized collective 
action. No matter how important an individual's role is, it 
remains limited if it does not have a social and political base. 
If it has such a base, it becomes much more important. 
[passage omitted] 
  [AL-SHA'B] Judging by your current disagreement with the 
leadership of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, are you 
thinking of establishing an alternative PLO or a parallel 
National Council? 
  [Hawatimah] We are against having two PLO's. At the same 
time, we do not wish to hand over the PLO as a gift to Yasir 
'Arafat. The PLO is not any person's private fief. We have 
blazed a path of political and armed struggle for 25 years now. 
The PLO's program since 1968 has asserted that the organization 
is actually a broad-based coalition. 'Arafat's wing, however, 
ruined the coalition and tore apart the unified national front 
that existed within the PLO. We call for rebuilding Palestinian 
national unity and the PLO's broad-based national coalition on 
democratic, electoral grounds that will restore the 
organization's legal and popular character. Its historical 
legality is no longer sufficient. 
  In this connection, we demand the election of a united 
national conference that will include representatives of our 
people inside and outside the occupied territories. We have 
begun preparatory steps with the hope of doing this by 13 
January. The work of this conference must focus on the 
following three basic issues: 
  1. We must formulate a collective political program for the 
Palestinian people inside and outside the occupied territories. 
To ensure a return to legitimacy, representatives of all the 
factions opposing the Rabin-'Arafat agreement must take part, in 
addition to representatives of opposition groups within Fatah 
itself. 
  2. Local leaders and subsequently a unified leadership of 
the people inside and outside the occupied territories must be 
elected. This leadership will head the unified national front 
that will be formed by the united national conference. 
  3. The united conference inside and outside the occupied 
territories must elect a unified committee to lay the groundwork 
for rebuilding the PLO's institutions, notably the Palestine 
National Council.

  [Text] Palestinian sources in Tunis informed our 
correspondent Yoni Ben-Menahem that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
and his special West Bank affairs adviser, Jibril al-Rajub, 
yesterday called Jamal al-Dik, a senior Fatah West Bank activist 
who had resigned last week from his organizational Fatah post. 
In the wake of this contact, Jamal al-Dik agreed to withdraw 
his resignation. The sources said that during his conversation 
with al-Dik Yasir 'Arafat expressed understanding for the 
reasons that led to the resignation and his interest in the 
demands of the young Fatah leadership in the territories.

<F P=106> ["News analysis" by chief editor Makram Muhammad Ahmad: </F>
"Growing Hopes for the Success of the Palestinian-Israeli Talks"] 
  [Excerpts] It would appear that the Palestinians and 
Israelis are coming closer to a compromise resolving their 
differences over the interpretation of some clauses of the 
Declaration of Principles. There are indications that in Cairo 
at the beginning of the new year the two sides will sign a more 
detailed agreement to implement the Declaration of Principles 
smoothly and without any new problems, allowing for an Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho on the scheduled date of 13 
April. 
  Although the latest round of talks that opened in Cairo on 
28 
December is going be tough and bitter, it is clear that the two 
sides fully realize that they have no alternative but to resolve 
their differences as soon as possible, and to reach a compromise 
ending the growing frustration in the occupied territories and 
sparing the two sides a desperate confrontation where mutual 
violence escalates to a serious point risking the collapse of 
the Declaration of Principles. 
  Rabin should have realized that he cannot, despite his rude 
bargains, reduce his agreement with the PLO to a limited 
administrative rule that firmly blocks Palestinian hopes for an 
independent state, and that he cannot distort the Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho to a redeployment of the 
occupation forces in the two regions. [passage omitted] 
  'Arafat, for his part, should have realized that the 
Gaza-Jericho First declaration is nothing more than a limited 
partial agreement concerning the first stage of an autonomy that 
will be implemented in all the occupied territories for the next 
three years before an agreement on the final status of the West 
Bank and Gaza is reached. Consequently, there is no need for 
mixing positions and stages in a manner that adds to Rabin's 
difficulties as he faces an increasingly vicious internal 
Israeli opposition. 
  In the face of Rabin's stubborn reading of the Declaration 
of 
Principles, 'Arafat tried to offer an alternative reading. But 
'Arafat's reading was at the other extreme, so wide and loose 
that it went beyond the text of the Declaration of Principles, 
mixed the various stages of implementation, and made the 
Palestinian state one of the objectives of the Gaza-Jericho 
First agreement. 
  Both 'Arafat and Rabin should have put himself in the shoes 
of the other so that they could reach a balanced agreement. 
There are limits to what each can accept now in a tense 
climate, mutual obsessions, escalating violence, and growing 
opposition seeking to foil the agreement so that violence and 
tension can prevail. 
  'Arafat cannot possibly accept a nominal withdrawal from 
Gaza 
and Jericho, no matter what Rabin's excuses and arguments about 
the security of Israel and its settlements. And Rabin cannot 
possibly now offer an implicit acceptance of an independent 
Palestinian state by agreeing to Palestinian border crossings, 
Palestinian national currency, or a Palestinian central bank. 
Accepting such points would mean more than an implicit 
recognition of the Palestinian state at an early stage that only 
offers autonomy in Gaza and Jericho first. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Palestinians and the War of Nerves"] </F>
  [Text] Apparently, these days Palestinians are being 
subjected to a multifaceted war of nerves aimed at pressuring 
them to adopt specific positions whether on the Arab level or in 
the talks with Israel. Obviously, the Palestinian stance 
regarding the issues under discussion does not please the other 
parties. Therefore, sometimes the Palestinian side is given a 
breather, and at other times it is spurned until its positions 
have cooked on a low fire until the pressure affects it. 
  Although comparison between the Palestinian-Arab dealings on 
one hand and the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the other 
is not pertinent, especially after taking into account the 
common Arab destiny and the single pan-Arab affiliation, those 
pressures have, however, drawn the attention of observers and 
made them inquire about the secret of their sequence within a 
span of a few days. Observers are also intrigued by the 
Palestinian reaction, which presumably will be forthcoming, and 
by the possible repercussions of such a reaction. 
  Palestinians have the right to adopt positions compatible 
with their supreme national interests just as any other people 
inside and outside the Arab world, particularly as those 
interests do not at all contradict the interests of the Arab 
brothers. Hence, apart from being natural and healthy, 
disagreements between Palestinians and their brothers are at the 
same time premature since the occupied territories are still 
subject to the authority of the Israeli occupation. Any talk 
about agreements, regardless of their shape or extent, is like 
placing the cart before the horse. 
  The Palestinian stance seeks an honest implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles, as affirmed by Egyptian Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa, who prior to leaving Amman stressed the need 
for implementing the provisions relating to Israeli withdrawal 
and establishment of a Palestinian national authority. 
  In the face of rapid developments, the Arab brothers are 
supposed to rise to the level of the historic and grave 
responsibilities and challenges and enhance coordination to 
confront the dangers threatening the unity of their positions 
and the comprehensiveness of their cause.

<F P=106> [Interview with al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, Palestinian </F>
representative, by Jordan TV correspondent for political affairs 
Kassab Samawi in Amman on 4 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-Rahim] I am confident that the 
[Jordanian-Palestinian] talks, which will be held tomorrow, will 
further reinforce coordination. The Palestinian leadership and 
the PLO Executive Committee have instructed the delegation to 
act in a way that serves and reinforces the interests of both 
sisterly peoples. There is no doubt that we do not want to see 
any crack in the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. In fact, 
we are keen to further strengthen this relationship, 
particularly at this time, during which Israeli is trying to 
evade its commitments to the peace process. 
  The Palestinian leadership noted, in its recent meeting, 
that 
coordination with Jordan is inevitable and necessary. 
  [Samawi] Your Excellency the Ambassador, his majesty the 
king 
reiterated in his recent speech the special nature of the 
Jordanian-Palestinian relationship. In light of the 
inevitability of coordination in this stage on the highest 
levels, how did the Palestinian leadership in Tunis receive the 
king's speech? 
  ['Abd-al-Rahim] The Palestinian leadership discussed his 
majesty's speech in its recent meeting. It read the bright side 
of the speech, which expressed concern for holding coordination 
with the PLO, for crystallizing the independent national 
Palestinian identity, and for highlighting the PLO's role. It 
also highlighted the national Jordanian concern for reinforcing 
coordination in all fields to serve the Palestinian people's 
steadfastness and to ease their suffering inside the occupied 
Arab territory. 
  Therefore, we received the speech differently from the way 
others seem to have received it. We made a sound assessment of 
its content. We found that, as in the recent meeting and before 
that, his majesty has kept his pledge and was concerned about 
all these objectives. This strengthens our negotiating stand in 
this stage in which Israel is trying to weaken our negotiating 
stand.

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Jan (MENA)--The Arab League has expressed 
concern over a provision in the recent agreement between the 
Vatican and Israel on respect for the de facto situation of the 
holy places in the occupied territories. 
  In a statement released today, the Arab League said it is 
afraid that this might be interpreted as an acknowledgement of 
Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. It 
emphasized the special standing Jerusalem enjoys in the Arab and 
Islamic worlds. 
  The following is the Arab League's statement today on the 
recent agreement between the Vatican and Israel on diplomatic 
recognition between the two countries: 
  Although it regards establishing diplomatic ties and signing 
agreements between states as a their right to sovereignty, the 
Arab League General Secretariat believes that such agreements 
should not ignore international legitimacy resolutions or 
(?cause) injustice to third parties' inalienable and legitimate 
rights. 
  In this respect, the League's general secretariat is eager 
to 
recall Jerusalem's special standing in the Arab and Islamic 
worlds, an established fact that has been asserted by the Arab 
League's numerous resolutions on all levels. 
  Regarding the provision in the agreement between the Vatican 
and Israel to respect the de facto situation of the holy places 
in the occupied territories, the Arab League secretariat general 
expresses its extreme concern lest this would be interpreted as 
recognition of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian 
territory. If we take into consideration that the Vatican has 
always adopted a firm stand consistent with the resolutions of 
the United Nations and international legitimacy on the question 
of rejecting Israeli sovereignty over the holy city and not 
changing its historic and cultural status, this new position 
demands that we emphasize our eagerness that this should not 
affect the status of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is an extremely 
sensitive issue for all the believers in the world. There is no 
doubt that based on its long history, which has been 
characterized by objectivity and fairness regarding the issue of 
Jerusalem, the Vatican will take all these factors into 
consideration so that peace and stability can be restored in the 
city of peace so it can remain a glowing symbol of coexistence 
and tolerance among the heavenly religions.

  [Excerpts] The 11th session of the Arab Interior Ministers' 
Council opened in Tunis this morning. The session will be held 
from 4 to 6 January. 
  Abdallah Kallel, the Tunisian minister of state and interior 
minister, read [Tunisian] President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's 
speech at the opening session. In his speech, President Zine El 
Abidine Ben Ali said in particular that duty calls on all Arab 
countries to arm themselves with the required initiative to 
overcome difficulties and spread amity and unity of word, 
stressing that the Tunisia of the new era is committed to follow 
that correct path. He said that as far as Tunisia is concerned, 
security must be all or nothing. [passage omitted] 
  In his speech, the head of state said that the strength of 
Arab society requires intensive and concerted efforts in order 
to prevent society from being influenced by dubious ideological 
trends and deviant behavioral patterns. The most dangerous of 
these are those which use religion as a pretext and Islam as a 
vehicle to resort to violence and terrorism with a view to 
achieving personal objectives, which are not unknown to any 
perceptive analyst. [passage omitted] 
  The agenda of the 11th session of the Arab Interior 
Ministers' Council, chaired by the Syrian interior minister, 
includes 18 items. Combating narcotics will be the most 
prominent among them. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tunis, Jan 4, SPA -- Arab interior ministers began 
their 11th meeting Tuesday [4 January] in Tunis. 
  The kingdom's delegation to the meeting is led by Prince 
Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the interior minister and honorary 
president of the council of Arab interior ministers. 
  Addressing the opening session, Prince Nayif, who is also 
the 
honourary chairman of the ministerial council, on behalf of his 
colleagues, thanked the Tunisian president for his constant 
support for the functions of the council and thanked the 
Tunisian Minister of Interior Abdallah Kallel for the excellent 
arrangements made for the meeting. 
  Prince Nayif also thanked the Sudanese minister of interior, 
who chaired the previous session for the good efforts he made 
and weclomed the chairman of the new session, the Syrian Foreign 
Minister [title as received] Muhammad Harbah and the new 
colleagues who join the meeting for the first time. 
  Citing the paramount issue of security, Prince Nayif said 
the 
required level of security should be maintained in any society 
as a basic element for progress and development. He underscored 
the top priority given by member states for security issue. 
  "Security is an essential element for continuation of 
stability and prosperity of people and our responsibility and 
duty is to work for harmonizing modernization and development 
process with security requirements," Prince Nayif told the 
meeting. 
  He said such meetings during which unwavering determination 
have been shown to reinforce security cooperation between the 
member states, despite the weak relations between some Arab 
states, is the tangible evidence for the common awareness on the 
necessity for realisation of better inter-Arab security 
cooperation and for creation of a suitable atmosphere that would 
help the concerned governments to achieve common aspiration and 
ambitions. 
  "The size of challenges imposed on our communities 
stipulates 
that we must accept the only option at our hands, that is to 
work together and sincerely to protect our peoples and their 
gains from all kinds of evils and deviations whether developing 
inside or coming from abroad due to the spread of sophisticated 
communication, and data equipments and techniques," Prince Nayif 
said. 
  The Saudi minister of interior urged other member states to 
follow the steps of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has 
managed to protect its people from deviations thanks to the 
implementation of Sharia laws on all aspects of life, besides 
the awareness of citizens and capability of security bodies. 
  Prince Nayif underlined the important issues on the agenda 
of 
the 11th session and urged all participants to cooperate for the 
implementation of the resolutions to be adopted by the meeting. 
  He said the session will be held amid painful security 
situations faced up by some Arab countries due to the increasing 
rates of crimes at regional and international levels, a matter 
that necessitate closer cooperation and coordination between the 
Arab security bodies. 
  He said the agenda of the meeting includes the top important 
issues for combat of crime and drugs menace and the role of 
media in fighting such crimes. 
  Prince Nayif conveyed to the participants the greetings of 
the Saudi leadership and people and expressed hope that the 
meeting would come out with the targeted successful results. 
  The meeting was also addressed by the Tunisian state 
minister 
for interior, who on behalf of President Ben Ali, welcomed the 
participants and underscored the important issues on the agenda 
of the meeting. 
  President Ben Ali highlighted the successful achievements 
realised by the Arab interior ministers council since its 
establishment in supporting the inter-Arab joint action in 
security spheres. 
  Ahmad Salim, secretary general of the council, for his part 
expressed delight over the meeting and thanked Prince Nayif for 
the valuable moral and material support he renders to the 
general secretariat on his capacity as the honourary chairman of 
the council. 
  Meanwhile, Prince Nayif met at his residence here today with 
Muhammad Harbah, the Syrian minister of interior and chairman of 
the current session of council of Arab interior ministers. The 
meeting was held in the framework of the bilateral talks between 
the Arab ministers of interior on the fringes of the session. 
  The meeting was attended by Ibrahim Sa'd al-Ibrahim, the 
Saudi ambassador to Tunisia and members of the delegation 
accompanying Prince Nayif.

  [Excerpts] Baghdad, 5 Jan (INA)--The Central Committee of 
the [pro-Iraq] Kurdistan Democratic Party has warned against the 
conspiratorial Western scheme targeting the accomplishments of 
the eternal 17-30 July revolution, and the gains made by the 
population of the Autonomous Region in northern Iraq. 
  This came in a final statement issued by the committee after 
an extraordinary meeting held to discuss the deteriorating 
situation experienced by our people in the Autonomous Region of 
Kurdistan. 
  The statement said: Our Kurdish people in the Autonomous 
Region of Iraqi Kurdistan are currently experiencing a 
catastrophic and miserable situation brought about by a 
malicious U.S.-British-Zionist scheme, the implementation of 
which was assigned to many parties whose common interests lie in 
fueling an inter-Kurdish war. 
  The statement added: This malicious Western scheme is meant 
to take revenge on great Iraq, its lofty people, and its wise 
leadership, particularly since the West has failed to achieve 
its evil objective of bringing Iraq to its knees in the 30-state 
aggression and successive chapters of aggression. 
  The statement went on to say: The parties that have 
exploited the tragic situation in the Autonomous Region of 
Kurdistan, which is living under the control of the agent 
cliques, harbor rancor toward the Kurdish people in particular, 
and Iraq in general. [passage omitted] 
  The statement affirmed that the Kurdistan Democratic Party 
is 
certain that our people, who have experienced hard times, as 
well as good times, cannot remain passive toward what is taking 
place in Turkey, nor can they remain silent over the ordeal our 
people are experiencing. For, they are bound to make a strong 
effort to return things to normal. The first thing they have to 
do, the statement noted, is to kick these agents off their land 
in order to bring about their humiliation and defeat, as well as 
the curse of both history and future generations. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Baghdad, 4 Jan (INA) -- Iraq has said that as of 31 
December 1993, some Arab regimes owe it a total of more than 
$1.2 billion. These regimes had either not repaid their debts

money along with interest.

  [Text] The FLN [National Liberation Front] political bureau 
has announced that its proposals on the draft platform [for 
dialogue] suggested by the National Dialogue Commission [NDC] 
were not taken into consideration. The FLN submitted a 
clarification of its proposals and the aspects of its 
disagreement with the proposals. 
  In a letter addressed yesterday to the NDC chairman, a copy 
of which the radio received, the FLN pointed out that it 
disagreed with the NDC over three essential issues. The first 
is the major amendment of the constitution. The FLN opposed 
amending the constitution and considered it a basic reference 
point which should be applied during the transitional period. 
The second issue is the alternative bodies. The FLN announced 
that it was not interested in the bodies which would succeed the 
Higher State Council [HSC] and the management of the 
transitional period. The FLN expressed its readiness to 
contribute to solving the problems when a real authority is 
established, at the end of the HSC's term of office, which would 
actually be committed to solving the problems. The third issue 
is the transitional period. The FLN opposed extending the 
transitional period in accordance with the proposed basis [by 
the NDC]. 
  The FLN reiterated its stance that the comprehensive and 
deep 
national dialogue would remain the only way to get the country 
out of the crisis.

  [Text] Jerusalem denies the announcement by Abu-al-'Ala' 
[Ahmad Quray'] in Oslo that Israel and the PLO might resume the 
Taba talks within hours, our political correspondent Shlomo Raz 
reports. Abu-al-'Ala' added that no breakthrough in the 
contacts between the two sides has been achieved so far. Our 
political correspondent adds that the Taba talks will be renewed 
soon since the PLO has accepted the Israeli stand that the 
deliberations must be based on the understandings reached in 
Cairo last week, as well as on the declaration of principles. 
  Minister Yosi Sarid said in the Knesset today that while 
Israeli and PLO positions have drawn closer in the past two 
days, he can still not say that this will necessarily lead to 
the immediate resumption of the negotiations, but he hoped that 
the Taba talks would be resumed next week on the basis of the 
document approved by both sides in Cairo. 
  Minister Ya'aqov Tzur called on the government to prepare 
for 
the possibility that after the interim stage, the Palestinian 
autonomy will become an independent entity or an independent 
state. He said a security corridor, incorporating the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] camps and Jewish settlements in the 
Jordan Rift Valley, should be set up along the Jordan River, and 
it should remain under contiguous Israeli control. Minister 
Tzur said that insisting on those principles in the negotiations 
now would enable Israel to show flexibility on less substantive 
issues. Minister Tzur was addressing a meeting of the United 
Kibbutz Movement which discussed the future of the settlements 
in the Jordan Rift Valley. 
  The Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs today 
discussed ways of dealing with the PLO's intention to set up 
extraterritorial areas in Jerusalem, such as currently exists at 
Orient House, which serves as PLO headquarters in East Jerusalem 
and comes under the control of Palestinian guards. Our 
political correspondent reports that security sources told the 
meeting that in order to prevent that happening, such moves 
should be defined as harming Israeli sovereignty and the 
relevant clauses of the Penal Code, such as the one dealing with 
treason, should be implemented

  [Text] In the Knesset, a move to have crucial issues 
concerning the peace process approved by a special majority of 
90 members was defeated this morning during a stormy debate. On 
the line from the Knesset, David Ze'ev reports: 
  Both sides were mobilized, and the vote was close: 46 in 
favor, 52 against, and three abstentions. 
  The bill presented by the Likud's Me'ir Shitrit stated that 
an agreement with the Palestinians will be possible only if five 
points are ensured: no Palestinian state between the Jordan 
River and the Mediterranean; Jewish settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and Gaza remaining under Israeli rule, with the 
government responsible for their existence and security; freedom 
of movement of the Israeli security forces throughout the 
territories to stop terrorist activity; no right of return of 
Palestinians who left in 1948 and 1967; and Jerusalem remaining 
Israel's united and eternal capital. To reverse any one of these 
points, three quarters of the Knesset, not just a simple 
majority, would have to vote in favor. 
  Cabinet Minister Yosi Sarid, responding for the government, 
said the government supports certain aspects of the bill, such 
as on Jerusalem, but objects to Jewish settlements in the 
territories continuing under Israeli rule forever -- certainly 
those settlements, said Sarid, that were built with the 
intention of sabotaging this government's policy of territorial 
compromise. 
  Minister Sarid, himself a participant in the recent 
negotiations with the Palestinians in Europe and Egypt, said he 
also objects to the principle of such legislation, limiting the 
authority of Israeli negotiations, and its acceptance, he said, 
would mean an end to the peace process.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Circles close to Likud 
Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu maintain that despite Netanyahu's 
declaration that he will not implement the Oslo agreement if he 
forms a government, the Likud chairman understands the agreement 
will be implemented in the near future. For this reason he 
intends to try to attain an understanding with Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin -- not necessary in the context of a national 
unity government -- regarding the continuation of the process. 
This understanding involves a compromise on the Golan Heights 
while preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state as 
part of the permanent arrangement. The circles add that there 
are other senior Likud figures in addition to Netanyahu who, in 
exchange for such an understanding, will give their support to a 
peace arrangement with Syria involving withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights buttressed by appropriate security arrangements.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Text] Yitzhaq Rabin, the prime minister and defense 
minister, in the past few weeks has approved the recommendations 
in a document written by the defense establishment detailing 
ways of aiding Palestinian collaborators for Israel, who have 
been living in a state of anxiety and uncertainty since the 
signing of the agreement with the PLO. 
  The document calls for the establishment of a special 
administrative unit within the Shin Bet for coordinating 
treatment of the collaborators, whose number is estimated at 
2,000. 
  The Shin Bet will receive a special budget to aid the 
collaborators. A security source told HA'ARETZ that the defense 
establishment attributes great importance to helping those who 
have aided Israel over many years, sometimes at great personal 
risk. 
  After the new administrative unit is set up, the defense 
establishment will direct it to positively review any request by 
collaborators who do not want to return to their homes in the 
territories for fear of being tried. Many collaborators are 
afraid that after the implementation of Gaza and Jericho 
withdrawal they and their families will be harmed. It was 
decided to establish the special administrative unit to help 
them deal with this problem. 
  At the same time Israel's representatives to talks with the 
PLO were directed to make the release of Palestinian prisoners 
who committed grave offenses conditional on an amnesty for the 
collaborators. 
  It was made clear, however, that terrorists convicted of 
murder are not included among those slated to be released in 
exchange for such an amnesty. 
  Sources in the defense establishment explain there must be 
mutual agreement that the PLO will pardon the collaborators, or 
at least promise they will not be harmed, while Israel will 
promise to accelerate prisoner releases. 
  In reaction, Palestinian sources yesterday said the PLO is 
firmly opposed to pardoning collaborators. 'Arafat has said in 
the past that collaborators will be tried.

<F P=106> [Report by Jerusalem correspondent Nadav Shragay] </F>
  [Text] Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said that he was not 
concerned or unduly ruffled by the official demarche submitted 
by the United States over construction plans in the Jerusalem 
area. Olmert said that with all due respect to the Americans and 
their amazement over the scope of construction around the city, 
they must understand that the future of Israel's capital will 
not be decided by the U.S. State Department. 
  Olmert declared his intention to foil any possibility of 
Jerusalem becoming the Palestinian capital. This was one of the 
reasons to increase construction work around the city. 
  "As far as the United States is concerned, the neighborhoods 
of Gilo, Ramot and Pisgat Ze'ev are not part of Jerusalem, and 
whoever wants to get along with the Americans has to give up 
Gilo as well. Of course, this is totally inconceivable," Olmert 
said. 
  Olmert met with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at the 
beginning 
of the week and presented a plan to pave "the east ring road," 
which was approved by the local planning board during the 
previous government's tenure. Olmert wants to expedite the 
paving of the road. One segment of the road lies outside the 
city's municipal jurisdiction. 
  According to Olmert, the road will prevent Arabs coming from 
the north from crossing through Jerusalem on their way to towns 
situated to its south. 
  In his meeting with Rabin, Olmert asked the prime minister 
to 
make sure that the government ministries fulfill their 
commitments to the Jerusalem Municipality expeditiously. Rabin 
acceded to the request and promised to instruct the ministers to 
give Jerusalem priority in their policies.

  [Text] There is to be no decision on the final disposition 
of the controversial expansion of the Bet Orot Yeshiva on the 
Mount of Olives until proper approval by the Jerusalem Planning 
Commission. This was made clear by Mayor Ehud Olmert last night, 
who ordered the removal of the seven mobile homes placed on land 
adjoining the yeshiva. The mayor says the religious seminary 
does not have all the necessary permits for the move. At the 
same time, Olmert told reporter Mark Weiss, that he still 
supports the construction of permanent buildings at the East 
Jerusalem site to house the yeshiva students and their families 
-- a move opposed by the previous mayor, Teddy Kollek. 
  [Begin recording] [Olmert] I think this is a private 
property, belongs to a Jew. I see no problem in that particular 
area, which is not densely populated by Muslims and Arabs; that 
there can be an institution. I don't think that the east side 
of Jerusalem should be empty of any Jewish presence; on the 
contrary. And, I don't remember that anyone was protesting when 
the Mormons were building a big university and a big campus. 
It's not Muslim, it's not Arab, and yet it was built and no one 
protested. Only when a Jew wants to build something in that 
particular area, and everyone protests. And, I don't quite 
agree with that. 
  [Weiss] And how do you react to the criticism that a move at 
this stage in the peace process could jeopardize the talks? 
  [Olmert] I don't see that there should be any connection 
between this and the peace process. If the peace process does 
not apply to Jerusalem, as everyone says, why should it be 
applied? Jerusalem is out of the context at the present time, 
it's supposed to be out of the context at the present time. We 
talk about Jericho and about Gaza, not about Jerusalem. [end 
recording] 
  Meretz Knesset Member Avraham Poraz has called on the 
attorney general to annul the Jerusalem Planning Commission's 
decision to allow building on the Bet Orot site. Poraz charges 
that the decision was illegal.

  [Text] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq says Israel is facing a 
very serious challenge in Gaza and Jericho. According to 
Lieutenant General Baraq, the agreement with the PLO confers 
three missions on the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]: To defend 
the external borders of the region included in the agreement, to 
guard the Jewish settlements, and to safeguard the travel axes. 
  Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Lt. Gen. Baraq told 
the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that the IDF 
understands that the government has decided to let the 
Palestinian police deal with the sources of terrorism. Israel 
assumes this will be a strong and efficient police which will 
cooperate with Israel in foiling terrorism and safeguarding the 
roads. The chief of staff made it clear that the IDF will 
continue to deal with terrorist acts along travel axes and in 
their vicinity. If the terrorists are not caught near the 
roads, however, the Palestinian police force will have to deal 
with them. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 4 January, 
reporting on the chief of staff's Knesset appearances, adds: 
"Lt. Gen. Baraq told the committee that in 1993, 450 people 
were stricken off the wanted list -- 42 of them were killed, the 
rest either turned themselves in, were caught, or escaped 
abroad. The chief of staff added that 1993 was characterized by 
a fight against terrorism in the security zone and the rest of 
Lebanon, as well as by the fight against the intifadah in Judaea 
and Samaria. At the same time the IDF continued its buildup 
program on the basis of the multiyear work plan."] 
  Answering a question regarding the involvement of senior 
officers in the agreement with the PLO, the chief of staff said 
that senior officers on the ground and in the General Staff are 
not supposed to deal with the political aspects of the 
agreement. At the same time the Army must explain in detail all 
the military ramifications and present its conclusions to the 
government. Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq is dealing with 
the technical aspects of the agreement and is trying to reach 
the best possible arrangements in the security sphere. The 
chief of staff rejected charges made by the opposition that 
those officers who are opposed to the agreement are being 
silenced. He added that there are no problems or uncertainties 
regarding orders relating to this issue or compliance therewith. 
  Our correspondent notes that at the opening of the session 
all members of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee 
congratulated the IDF since over the last year no soldiers were 
killed in training accidents.

not just another insignia on the shoulder, but calls for 
additional work and responsibility and for the use of all 
possible qualifications in order to see the present and envision 
the future so as to supply answers to fast-changing problems. 
Maj. Gen. Mofaz is in charge of a most sensitive region, the 
prime minister stressed, and his job calls for a variety of 
qualifications, not just military ones. 
  Our military affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe points 
out 
that Maj. Gen. Mofaz will soon also be assigned to a senior job 
in the IDF's field command.

<F P=106> [Article by Bina Barzel] </F>
  [Text] This Wednesday [22 December], Yehudit Biton ordered 
a bouquet of violets sent to the office of Knesset Member [MK] 
David Levi. "It was his birthday yesterday," Levi's executive 
secretary said, "I also ordered a cake for lunch as his friends 
will be coming to issue congratulations." 
  Friends indeed showed up at the Tel Aviv offices of the 
voluntary society for the election of David Levi, which are 
situated in a ground floor apartment in an old building, rented 
for three years and recently renovated, on Balfour Street. Rubi 
Rivlin, Mikha'el Kleiner [former Likud MK's], Moti Mis'ani, 
David 'Amar from Nesher, Gabi Lalush from Dimona, Yehuda Bros 
from Yavne, Ya'aqov Bardugo from the Union of Local Authorities 
in Israel, Aharon Abu-Hatzera [former Likud MK], Levi's sons, 
Shim'on and Jackie, and his brother Armond. David Levi has 
apparently not dropped out of the political arena, he has just 
purposely adopted a lower profile. 
  At the entrance to the apartment there are shelves with 
files. Yehudit has glued a picture of Levi on each file. There 
is a ficus plant, artificial flowers, and potted plants on the 
small desks. A modern print adorns the wall, and gray carpets 
blend nicely with the black furniture. 
  David Levi, 54, has organized his network of contacts and 
political activities from this apartment ever since the last 
Likud convention. This is where one can find his friends from 
all over Israel, every Thursday, which is "Tel Aviv Day" for 
most of the political system. It has recently become apparent 
that this apartment may also conceal a steadily ticking time 
bomb, aimed at Binyamin Netanyahu. 
  This is because Levi, despite his self-enforced temporary 
abstinence from power struggles inside the Likud, will soon face 
decisions whose implementation may threaten Netanyahu's chances 
to be elected prime minister. The very fact that Levi has 
confronted Netanyahu and refused to accept his leadership are 
already causing a steady erosion in the latter's standing. 
  Netanyahu's supporters claim that Levi's silence is no 
silence at all, but rather a cleverly muted struggle, which 
allows the members of Levi's camp to act against the Likud 
chairman and thus harm him. 
  Levi: "I want you to know I do not sit around planning. I 
do not deal with this." 
  David Levi holds his cards very close to his chest. It has 
always been his custom to keep his moves secret until the very 
last minute. Like many politicians, his assessment is that the 
political situation will only be clear after the results of the 
implementation of the Oslo agreement are known. A source close 
to Levi says: "the assumption is that next January will be the 
decisive month. It is clear that Rabin has invited the 
Americans to pressure him on the Syrian track." 
  Another assessment is that Rabin will issue a call for 
national unity, after implementing the first stage of the Oslo 
agreement, the withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Then 
the Likud will face a real problem. 
  Speaking off the record, people in Levi's camp reveal their 
uncertainties: Is it a good idea to initiate a move to hold 
another round of primaries to choose the Likud candidate for 
prime minister? Perhaps it would be better to push for a 
national unity government? What can Levi's camp gain out of 
generating internal struggles within the Likud? Is there no 
alternative but to eventually leave the Likud, as was once 
recommended by several members of Levi's camp, including his 
brother, Maxim? What would happen if an effort was made to 
garner the support of 75 percent of Central Committee members 
for holding repeat primaries for the movement's leadership and 
it failed, with Binyamin Netanyahu remaining at the head of the 
party? David Levi does not seem to have any clear answers to 
these questions. 
  One option he was prepared to reject categorically this 
week was the possibility of moving over to Labor, either with or 
without his group of MK's, as the late Moshe Dayan did at the 
time. "Says who?" Levi laughs. "Look, I am the subject of all 
sorts of predictions and speculation. They make me laugh. I 
remain loyal to my own way. There is no way I will move over to 
Labor." 
  However, some of Levi's followers are beginning to lose 
their 
patience and are pressuring him to take some action one way or 
another. One follower says: "There is a real feeling that the 
leadership is faltering, that Raful Eytan's standing in the 
polls is better than that of Bibi Netanyahu. So far, Levi has 
been biding his time in silence, but the day is getting near 
when he will have to make up his mind." 
  Two trends can be seen in Levi's camp: Some of his men 
believe he should join Bibi and take second place in the 
leadership. If Bibi fails, Levi would naturally take his place. 
These men are encouraged by messages reaching Levi, whereby 
Bibi is prepared to give him pretty much everything short of the 
leadership in exchange for his cooperation. This option is 
apparently backed by Rubi Rivlin, Levi's brother Maxim, Aharon 
Abu-Hatzera, and Dudi Appel. Off the record, activists say that 
at this point Levi should desist from running for the 
premiership, seeing that this is not a realistic option at the 
moment. 
  A second option: to contest the leadership, either in 
internal or external primaries and, at the same time, to openly 
challenge the Likud chairman. Mikha'el Kleiner and Moti 
Mish'ani are "pushing" for such a move. Kleiner: "In the first 
round, Rabin would get 40 percent, and the rest would be split 
between Levi, Raful, and Bibi. In addition to Levi's traditional 
supporters, many middle-of-the-road voters appreciate Levi and 
would vote for him. The same applies to religious and 
ultra-Orthodox voters. There is a chance of Levi coming out 
first among the right-wing candidates in the first round and 
then getting the votes of the entire right-wing camp, which 
would close ranks behind him in the second round." 
  Of course, another option is to keep the present situation: 
to be considered the No. 2 man, but to stay outside. Given its 
present condition, such a stance could lead to the Likud's 
disintegration and force political activists to look for a new 
home. 
  A victory party was held last week in the home of David 
'Amar, head of the Nesher local council and an old-time 
associate of Levi. Many leading members of Levi's camp are heads 
of local councils. These men naturally dream of being part of 
the list of candidates to the Knesset, and a gung ho camp could 
promote them politically. 
  Small wonder that in the jolly get-together in Nesher some 
people once again called on Levi to set out on a fight within 
the Likud, using the excuse of the political situation, the 
agreement with the PLO, and the Likud's stuttering response. 
Levi's camp must see to the well-being of the Likud and the 
country, they said. Levi was reluctant to become personally 
involved in such a move, but he did not curb the initiative to 
summon a Likud Central Committee session to discuss the issue. 
  Neither did Levi conceal his opposition to Netanyahu's 
proposal that the Likud formulate a political plan in response 
to the Oslo agreement. Without using Bibi's name, Levi said: 
"The political issue is the most critical to the Likud, to its 
performance and survival. When the government signed the 
agreement with the PLO, the Likud should have displayed 
determination, endurance, and loyalty to its own way. However, 
the Likud did not pass the test. There were people who talked 
about the need to discuss the Likud's policy and even to amend 
its platform." 
  Levi survived the trauma of moving from the government to 
the opposition relatively easily. His friends decided to keep 
the organization set up to promote his election in the Likud 
primaries. This organization also finances all the 
expenditures incurred by his activities. Its members pay 
"according to their ability," about $100 or more a month. 
Incidentally, the initiative to keep the organization alive 
came from Rubi Rivlin, "so that Levi need not depend on some guy 
with big bucks." 
  Two of Levi's sons, Jackie (the acting chairman of Bet 
She'an's local council) and Shim'on (a businessman), bought 
daddy a Volvo and even drive him around when his chauffeur is 
unavailable. 
  In his free time, Levi goes fishing in the canals in the Bet 
She'an Valley. When the mood strikes him, he redecorates his 
house, tearing down and building new walls. 
  Levi nurtures the political contacts he made when he was 
foreign minister. He keeps in touch with the Jewish communities 
in Europe, and visited them three times since the last election, 
twice accompanied by his wife. He does work for the 
drug-fighting association and large families. 
  Levi meticulously reports to important Knesset plenum 
sessions. He does not make eye contact with Bibi, but he submits 
numerous motions to the agenda. He is very involved in faction 
meetings. He can be frequently seen in the Knesset cafeteria, 
always surrounded by journalists. 
  Levi has become an important and appreciated spokesman of 
the 
right wing on foreign and security affairs, in addition to his 
dedication to social issues. It was only last week that he led 
the fight to secure jobs for hundreds of workers fired from the 
'Of-Tov factory in Bet She'an. 
  Based on his experience in the contacts preceding the Madrid 
conference, he constantly cautions about the dire consequences 
of the government capitulating in the negotiations with the PLO, 
warns against euphoria and the legitimization of the PLO. He 
fears the way to a Palestinian state might be paved by "an 
autistic government, that is incapable of reading the signs of 
distress of the people." "There is anxiety in every household, 
the government is teasing the people," he stated in one of his 
latest appearances in the Knesset. 
  Nevertheless, David Levi has a real problem. If he joins 
Bibi and helps him win, he will be securing himself the No. 2 
position in the Likud but will be giving up his dream of 
becoming leader of the Likud and prime minister. If he 
challenges the leadership once again he might hasten Netanyahu's 
demise, but he might also fall together with him and pave the 
way for another candidate. He must also be careful not to be 
blamed again for the Likud's failure. 
  Netanyahu would today seem to be aware of Levi's power. In 
the first days after his impressive victory in the primaries, 
the message of Bibi's men was that Levi was "a dead horse." 
Bibi perfunctorily called on Levi to come over and work 
together. 
  However, that picture soon changed. Messages started to flow 
from Netanyahu's followers to Levi's camp about the need for a 
reconciliation between the two men. These days, when the right 
wing is in crisis, the two men should close ranks. A few months 
ago, Gush Emunim members in Netanyahu's camp tried to pull off a 
handshake between Netanyahu and Levi during of the 
demonstrations they organized after the signing of the agreement 
of principles. It did not work out. Bibi took the initiative 
and personally phoned Levi in his Bet She'an home four months 
ago. His wife Rashel quashed the attempt. "David is not at 
home," she said. When Bibi called again he got the same answer. 
Bibi asked that Levi phone him back, but Levi did not return 
his call. 
  In intimate meetings, Bibi's men talk about the Levi-Bibi 
axis as a necessary and desirable move. One of them told me 
they realize that similar to the Peres-Rabin match they can 
either rise or fall together. "Bibi will be ready to walk all 
the way from Jerusalem to Bet She'an to make up with Levi," one 
mediator told me. It seems that Bibi will also be willing to 
promise Levi the job of acting chairman of the Likud. 
  However, Levi does not seem eager to make up. He feels ill 
at ease with Bibi, and not just because of the videocassette 
affair. Their relationship soured as early as in the days when 
Bibi was appointed deputy minister in the Foreign Ministry, as a 
Shamir "plant" -- at least that is how the Levi camp sees it. 
"A media old rag," people in Levi's camp called Bibi in those 
days. 
  Referring to reports about the proposal to appoint him 
deputy 
chairman of the Likud, Levi says: "These are rumors, and I do 
not know who spreads them. What purpose do they serve? Are 
they meant to confuse Likud members and create an atmosphere 
whereby there are people who propose, give, and bestow while 
others make demands and say no? In any event, those proposals 
are not made candidly." 
  Advocates of the Bibi-Levi axis were encouraged recently 
when 
it emerged once again that the so-called Likud princes do not 
consider David Levi their leader. Even if Bibi failed and Beni 
Begin dropped out of the race, there is another candidate: Dan 
Meridor. 
  When HA'ARETZ reported that many of Levi's men support 
Meridor's candidacy, these hastened to his Tel Aviv office to 
make clear they were not the ones. An investigation into the 
source of the report was conducted in the corridor outside, and 
suspicion fell on Ya'aqov Verdugo, spokesman of the Local 
Authority Center and an associate of Maxim Levi. Verdugo denied 
it all, of course. "David Levi is the joy and hope of my 
generation," Verdugo told me in response to my question about 
Levi's standing among Likud voters. However, the fact remains 
that Levi's prolonged silence, the Likud's frustration and 
general condition have left cracks, however thin, in Levi's camp. 
  When asked about his relations with Bibi Netanyahu, Levi's 
pronouncements are convoluted and rather vague. He will not 
even mention Bibi's name. 
  Levi: "I cut down the area of friction. There is a given 
situation. I do not bother anybody. I demand absolutely 
nothing. Let nobody say that I bother anybody. I have reached 
the conclusion that genuine concern for the Likud cannot only 
come from me. If a struggle is necessary and if there is cause 
for it, this should concern everybody. I am not the only one 
who should worry." 
  When his associates ask him about Bibi's performance, he 
refuses to comment. However, at times he may be heard reciting 
whole passages of snide comments made by other critics of 
Netanyahu. "And that is the man of whom it was said that he 
will bring the Likud to power," he ends with a smile. 
  [Barzel] You were offered, on Bibi's behalf, the No. 2 
position and to be part of the leadership. If Bibi were to 
approach you with a consolidated proposal, would there be 
anything to talk about? 
  [Levi] Nobody is giving me anything, and I am not demanding 
anything. There is a given situation. I am not bothering 
anybody and I am not expecting any proposals. 
  [Barzel] Let us talk about your occupations outside the 
Likud. How many hours a week do you go fishing? 
  [Levi] Fishing is not measured in hours. I have been a 
fishing buff since childhood. I feel extraordinarily calm when 
I am in contact with nature. It feels like yoga. 
  [Barzel] Do you have fishing rods and other equipment? 
  [Levi] Sure. I bring the fish, gray mullet and trout, to 
Rashel and she cooks them in a special way with red peppers and 
lots of garlic and parsley. These are my favorite fish. They 
are fresh and I caught them. Even when I am abroad, I eat 
mainly fish and fruit, both because of kosher rules and because 
I love fish. 
  [Barzel] What's your wife's name, Rahel or Rashel? 
  [Levi] I call her Rashel. That was her name when I met her, 
when we immigrated to Israel. It was the eve of Passover. She 
came from Casablanca with a family of 12 children, and I came 
from Rabat with my family of eight. We traveled by taxi, with 
forged passports. When we reached the Strait of Gibraltar I saw 
Rashel lifting some suitcases and I ran to help her. Later she 
befriended my sister and my late mother. This relationship 
continued in the immigrant camp in Marseilles. 
  Then the time came to immigrate to Israel, and our family's 
turn came before hers. We separated, hoping to meet again in 
Israel. We were sent to Bet She'an, and a few months later she 
arrived here with her family. They wanted to live in Jerusalem, 
but they were told that Bet She'an was close enough. I had gone 
to send her a letter, to the camp in Marseilles. On my way back 
home to our cabin I noticed a big commotion outside. I found 
her and her family embracing my mother and sisters. It was the 
biggest surprise of my life. 
  [Barzel] Do you consult her or your family? 
  [Levi] Our family grew with political awareness. If there 
is a certain situation, the whole house gets involved and we 
talk about it on Saturday. My children, including the married 
ones, did not leave Bet She'an. One of my daughters married a 
man whose family lives in France, but I trust that she will soon 
bring her husband to Israel. Another daughter lives "far away," 
in Tiberias. All my children and grandchildren come on Saturday 
to the warm nest we have built. 
  I do not only love fishing, but also building. Every year or 
two I pull down a wall and start building. It drives Rashel 
crazy. "Here we go again with the mess. I do not know how am I 
going to deal with it," she says. But, all my sons and 
daughters help out. Small renovation work I do alone, either at 
night or on Fridays. Recently I pulled down a few walls in order 
to enlarge the dining room, and thank God, now I have a big and 
beautiful house. 
  I am happy that my sons and daughters stayed in Bet She'an, 
that they decided the way they did. They remained faithful to 
something I appreciate, togetherness. They pay a price for it 
though. Shim'on, for example, gave up an important security job 
which would have meant moving away. But, there are rewards. 
Everybody here has known him from the day he was born. In our 
town, people who make it do not leave. I did the same when I 
was foreign minister. I used the official apartment in 
Jerusalem only one Saturday. Every Friday afternoon we rushed 
back to Bet She'an to get ready for the Sabbath. 
  [Barzel] And how will you get to Bet She'an when an autonomy 
is established in Jericho? 
  [Levi] I will drive through Jericho. What is happening will 
not block my way to Jerusalem. I think that losing the road 
from the Jordan Valley to Jerusalem would be tantamount to 
losing the natural connection between the entire north of Israel 
and Jerusalem, and that is why this will not come to happen. My 
feeling is that the road to Jerusalem will not be blocked. 
  [Barzel] When you were foreign minister you met heads of 
state. When you were construction minister you built in Judaea, 
Samaria, Gaza, and Jerusalem. Is it not hard for you now, 
without all this activity? 
  [Levi] There is a proverb in Arabic which says: "When times 
get tough, a man who worked all his life will smell his hands 
and feel satisfied." I did something for this country. 
Wherever I go people remember my dedication. Unfortunately, 
within my own party people are trying to minimize and blur my 
contribution. But friends remember. Wherever I visit, people 
call me "Mr. Minister." I say to them: "Ex-minister." But 
they insist: "You will always be a minister to us." That is 
nice, never mind the belief that politics is ruthless. Only 
people who have not been put to a test can be predators, without 
any regard for rules, friendship, or loyalty.

  [Excerpts] In the Foreign Ministry's regular briefing this 
morning, Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Sulayman Abu Salih reviewed 
Sudanese-Eritrean relations. [passage omitted] 
  The minister also talked about Sudanese-British relations, 
pointing out that these relations are historic and all the 
problems between the two countries could be solved through 
dialogue. 
  The minister referred to the wrong behavior by the British 
ambassador to Khartoum and asked Britain to send a new 
ambassador who would work toward strengthening relations between 
the two countries. 
  The minister also talked about the archbishop of 
Canterbury's 
visit to the rebel areas. He said the visit was seen as support 
for mutiny, a violation of national sovereignty, and a call to 
war. He also said that the visit contributed to the 
deterioration of Sudanese-British relations. He described the 
archbishop's action as a political one on whose basis the thesis 
of mutiny would be built. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The weekly forum of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs convened today. Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Sulayman 
Abu Salih spoke at the forum, reviewing Sudanese-Eritrean 
relations, Sudanese-British relations, the visit of the 
archbishop of Canterbury and the visit of the deputy president 
of the Chinese state council and minister of foreign affairs to 
the Sudan. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking about Sudanese-British relations, the minister of 
foreign affairs reviewed the past history of relations with 
Britain and emphasized that relations with the West need to be 
based on adequate foundations through dialogue for the benefit 
of both sides, as seen by the British crown prince. 
  The foreign minister said that the expulsion of the British 
ambassador is final, as the ambassador no more serves the 
interests of relations between the two countries and has become 
an obstacle in the way of bilateral relations. He said that the 
decision does not mean the failure or cutting off of relations, 
but that the situation requires the appointment of an ambassador 
who believes in the importance of these relations. 
  As to the visit of the archbishop of Canterbury to the 
Sudan, 
the minister said that the invitation was extended by the 
Sudanese Episcopal Church, which groups 17 bishops, and that the 
invitation was not extended by the rebel movement. He said the 
archbishop rejected the invitation of the Sudanese Church and 
contacted the factions of the rebel movement at their sites in 
the Sudanese border areas held by the rebels, indicating that 
such a visit is considered a violation of the national 
sovereignty of the Sudan and a backing of the rebel movement, 
thus a contribution in the deterioration of relations between 
the two countries. The foreign affairs minister wondered 
whether the British officials would allow an Islamic leader to 
visit Ireland and talk with the leaders of the IRA. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has expressed pride in the 
distinguished performance of the members of the Armed Forces, 
Public Security forces, General Intelligence Directorate, and 
Civil Defense forces based on their awareness, honesty, 
sacrifices, and strength to safeguard this homeland's security 
and stability. His majesty the king greeted all the sons of the 
homeland, whatever their circumstances, in this delicate stage. 
He reiterated his pride in all those who shouldered their 
serious and delicate responsibilities to represent Jordan in the 
peace talks following the national decision to move toward 
Madrid in order to work for the interest of the country and to 
preserve the right of the people and the whole nation to life. 
The king made these remarks during his meeting at the Royal 
Hashemite Court today with the senior officers in the public 
security, general intelligence, and civil defense fields. 
  The king reaffirmed Jordan's commitment to move toward a 
just 
and comprehensive peace that will provide the next generations 
with a free and honest life. 
  His majesty touched on Arab coordination, beginning with 
Jordanian-Palestinian coordination. He noted that the talk in 
this regard stems from our concern about the kinsfolk and 
brothers in the occupied territory with whom we have lived 
through difficult and tough circumstances by steadfastness and 
adherence to their land. 
  King Husayn said: These circumstances require the 
Palestinian leadership to choose and clearly define the features 
of its march, asking God that it reflects what we firmly believe 
is found in the conscience and heart of the Palestinian people 
in the occupied territory and elsewhere and that it shoulders 
the responsibility that will enable it assume its duty and major 
role to serve the Palestinian people on the path of achieving 
their aspirations and hopes. 
  King Husayn: With regard to the relationship with us, we are 
walking on the road followed by our fathers and grandfathers. 
We shared our daily bread as one community in Palestine and 
Jordan. 
  His majesty said: Our democratic march is an expression of 
our belief that everybody should participate in decisionmaking 
and laying down the features of the future through awareness, 
determination, honesty, sincerity, and cooperation between the 
three branches of power and the people who are our strength, the 
reason of our existence, and the objective of our determination. 
  King Husayn called for preserving national unity and 
safeguarding it through belief, reason, and logic. He also 
called for a unique example to be given for the coming 
generations.

<F P=106> [By Salamah Ni'mat in Amman] </F>
  [Excerpt] Official Jordanian sources yesterday said that in 
case a Jordanian-Israeli agreement is reached in the absence of 
coordination between Jordan and the PLO, the Jordanian 
Government would resort to establishing crossing points between 
the East and West Bank other than the known traditional 
crossings. 
  The sources told AL-HAYAH that the government would reuse 
the 
Damiya Bridge which links Jordan with the Nabulus region, which 
is not part of the limited autonomous self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho, or would establish a crossing point in the city of 
al-'Aqabah on the Red Sea "to facilitate the passage of 
Palestinian and Jordanian citizens and to link between the two 
wings of the Arab world in North Africa and Asia." 
  It is known that travelers between the East and West Bank 
currently use the King Husayn (Allenby) Bridge and the Prince 
Muhammad Bridge over the River Jordan in the Jordan Valley. It 
is clear that any such Jordanian measure will render useless any 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement on crossings from and to the 
Jericho region. 
  The Jordanian sources stressed that any such step "will 
facilitate traffic between the two banks, especially since most 
West Bank Palestinians hold Jordanian passports." One of the 
sources criticized Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat due to "his 
disinclination to coordinate with Jordan" on the issue of 
crossings, "without taking into consideration that any 
arrangements on any side of the border must take place through 
coordination with the other side." 
  The source stressed that Jordan "desires to ease the immense 
pressure" on the Palestinian citizens in the occupied 
territories "as much as it can." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Faysal al-Shubul] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani has 
stated that if the PLO wants Jordan to understand the pressures 
being put on the PLO leadership, it should try to understand the 
pressures being put on Jordan. In a statement to AL-WASAT, he 
said: "No one party should ask the other to be more 
understanding because we are in the same boat and are facing the 
same circumstances and difficulties." 
  Al-'Anani added: "We believe there must be coordination with 
our Palestinian brothers prior to any agreement with the 
Israelis, but the brothers in the PLO seem to have another 
concept. Each side has its own identity and aspirations that do 
not conflict with one another. We should not allow pressures to 
have a negative effect on our relations. Coordination is 
necessary at this stage and is required for sound negotiations. 
Commonality of interests and the requirements of successful 
negotiations make us demand coordination which, we believe, has 
no alternative." He added: "All this does not mean 
estrangement. Jordan believes that postponement of coordination 
will not serve any side." 
  Al-'Anani revealed that Jordan and the PLO have reached many 
agreements on trade, investment, citizens' travel, free zones, 
transit, movement in the Arab region, security, borders, and 
water. These agreements have not been signed. 
  Asked about opening branches for Jordanian banks in the 
occupied West Bank, the Jordanian information minister said that 
this step would not have been discussed with the Israeli side if 
it had not already been discussed with the Palestinian side. It 
was one of the agreements we reached with the PLO. He denounced 
reports that Jordan decided to exploit the current opportunity 
to reopen the banks. 
  Replying to another question, the information minister said 
that the issue of establishing a Palestinian monetary authority 
still seems to be a possibility. Our negotiations with the 
Palestinians do not conflict with that possibility, and, if 
realized, we will hold further negotiations. 
  It is noteworthy that Dr. Jawad al-'Anani was one of the 
prominent members of the Jordanian negotiating delegation. He 
is also a well-known economist and held the position of trade 
and industry minister in 1984 and 1985. 
  It is also worth mentioning that Jordanian officials feel 
that the PLO wants to put off the signing of the economic 
agreement with Jordan until the PLO's leadership returns to 
Jericho.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Talal al-Hasan, minister of state </F>
for foreign affairs, in Amman, by Fawzi al-Jundi in Cairo, on 
the "Dialogue From Afar" program; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Jundi] Your Excellency, let us begin this 
interview with the outcome of the visit to Amman by Egyptian 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and the importance of coordinating 
stands, particularly the Jordanian-Palestinian stand, now as 
well as in coming days. 
  [Al-Hasan] You know that Jordanian-Egyptian coordination is 
constant. His Majesty King Husayn and his brother President 
Husni Mubarak have always been very careful to maintain that 
coordination with a view to serving bilateral ties and, 
accordingly, the peace process and the common stands that 
constitute the proper framework for strengthening the all-Arab 
stand to serve the higher common interests of all Arabs. His 
Majesty King Husayn received Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa in 
Amman. They held an extensive discussion in a cordial and 
fraternal climate on ways to enhance bilateral ties. They also 
reviewed the peace process' progress along the various tracks. 
They agreed to continue coordination to achieve the desired 
results. 
  [Al-Jundi] Since we are talking about coordination, a 
meeting 
is currently being held between the Palestinian and Jordanian 
brothers in the Jordanian capital, Amman, to coordinate stands 
between Jordan and the PLO and to prepare an economic agreement 
between the Palestinian and Jordanian sides. Will you shed 
light on the importance of developing the Palestinian-Jordanian 
dialogue? 
  [Al-Hasan] You know that Jordan has always called for such 
comprehensive coordination. We have always called for 
supporting every effort that would strengthen the position of 
the Arab negotiators and enhance coordination at the bilateral 
and collective levels. We were keen to offer every assistance 
to the Palestinians to support their position during the peace 
process and on other issues. We started coordinating with the 
Palestinian brothers long before the peace process. Now, on the 
eve of the coordination meetings, we hope that a climate of 
clarity and frankness will prevail during the meetings. We hope 
these meetings produce the desired results that will truly 
support the Palestinian brothers and, accordingly, the 
collective Arab stand. 
  [Al-Jundi] King Husayn has warned President 'Arafat not to 
talk about a confederation between Jordan and the Palestinians. 
Is there a specific Jordanian stand on the issue of 
confederation? 
  [Al-Hasan] His Majesty King Husayn was very clear in the 
second speech he made a few days ago about the issue of 
confederation and other issues. We have explained Jordan's 
stand on confederation on several occasions. This issue is not 
under consideration at present, hence it cannot be discussed; it 
should be left until the brother Palestinians obtain and 
exercise self-determination and express their views freely. We 
are leaving this matter up to the Jordanian and Palestinian 
peoples. The issue of confederation is not under discussion 
right now. What we are doing at present is coordinating stands 
during the peace process and negotiations so that our stands can 
be clarified and our collective interests served. 
  [Al-Jundi] King Husayn will visit the U.S. capital, 
Washington, in the next few days. What can we say about 
Jordan's expectations of a direct and clear U.S. role in pushing 
the Middle East peace march ahead, particularly along the 
Jordanian-Israeli track? 
  [Al-Hasan] As far as the role of the U.S. sponsor in the 
Middle East peace process is concerned, it is clear that the 
U.S. is determined to give the peace process all the support and 
impetus it needs. This was emphasized by U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher during his recent visit to Amman and 
the region. He affirmed that the Arab-Israeli conflict has top 
priority in U.S. foreign policy. Hence, we trust that the U.S. 
Administration will perform its role as a full partner and 
honest mediator in the peace process. This will give the 
process the impetus it needs and will serve as one of the main 
instruments for progress on the various Arab tracks.

  [Text] London, QNA -- Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, minister of 
information and minister of state for Cabinet Affairs, has 
stated that the differences on the Jordanian-Palestinian 
economic agreement revolve around the date of its implementation. 
  In an interview with Radio London yesterday, al-'Anani 
explained that the Palestinian side believes that the economic 
agreement should be implemented following an agreement on Gaza 
and Jericho while the Jordanian side believes it should precede 
any Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said that Jordan has had economic relations 
with the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 and that this 
relationship needs to be organized under the canopy of the new 
framework. That is why there is no reason to postpone such a 
reorganization until after the conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho 
negotiations. 
  Dr. al-'Anani denied that the disagreement between the two 
sides stems from the fact that the Palestinians want to have a 
central bank of their own that will supervise the banks that 
open in the West Bank. Al-'Anani said that the agreement 
stipulates that banking arrangements included in the agreement 
will remain in force until the end of the transitional period, 
or the establishment of a central Palestinian monetary 
institution, whichever takes place first. 
  Dr. al-'Anani emphasized that the PLO should coordinate with 
Israel before coordinating with Jordan because any agreement 
reached between Israel and the PLO directly affects Jordan. 
[sentence as published] 
  Dr. al-'Anani said that the conclusion of an agreement 
between the PLO and Jordan will have a positive impact on the 
process of negotiations as this will reassure people that 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations will be organized and clearly 
defined relations based on sound foundations. Al-'Anani 
affirmed that Jordanian-Palestinian coordination is very 
important, and that is why they should not be exposed to the 
political ups and downs that accompany the negotiations. 
  The Jordanian-Palestinian agreement that was finalized two 
months ago stipulates the reopening of the Jordanian banks that 
were operational in the occupied territories in 1967. The 
agreement also tackles trade between the two sides and attempts 
to invigorate them, and covers investments, infrastructure 
contracts, free zones, and transit operations.

  [Text] The Lower House of Parliament resumed its debate of 
the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations behind a closed door. Prime 
Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali made a statement last Wednesday 
[29 December] at the start of the debate on developments in the 
negotiations. His statement followed a vote in favor of a 
closed door meeting. 
  Several representatives today demanded that their meeting 
should be held open and they argued the government had made its 
statement and that many things became clear after yesterday's 
speech by his majesty the king. 
  After a discussion of the move the house speaker decided 
that 
the debate should again proceed behind closed doors.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Frankness Is a Must"] </F>
  [Text] King Husayn spoke with utmost frankness to his 
brave soldiers. He briefed them, along with the sons of this 
homeland, on the great pressures and responsibilities that 
Jordan has borne and is still bearing. No other country could 
have remained steadfast while facing these pressures and 
responsibilities and at the same maintained its principles and 
its security, and continued carrying its message. 
  With the right words, his majesty reviewed the pan-Arab and 
courageous role Jordan had played in rescuing the major part of 
Palestine, and the position it adopted in 1967, without which 
Israel would have occupied both banks [of the Jordan River]. 
  Twenty years ago, Jordan tried to warn of the vacuum that 
would result from viewing the PLO as the sole legitimate 
representative of the Palestinian people, not for ambitions or 
intentions it was harboring, but to give the country from which 
the land was snatched the opportunity to regain it before giving 
it back to its owners. But the Rabat summit decision was adopted 
at that time, and the vacuum of which Jordan had warned occurred. 
  When Jordan decided to disengage links with the West Bank, 
it 
sought to cede the land to the Palestinians and not the 
Israelis. However, developments and recent agreements did not 
fully lead in this direction. A new situation surfaced with 
which Jordan tried to deal with the highest possible 
self-restraint, and declared that it accepts what the 
Palestinian leadership accepts. 
  Nevertheless, the brothers in the Palestinian leadership 
began to keep away from coordination, which aims in the first 
place to safeguard their authority on their soil and to realize 
the hoped-for objectives of ending the occupation and attaining 
independence and sovereignty. 
  Since the signing of the PLO-Israeli agreement, Jordan has 
been aiming to reach an understanding with the future authority 
in the West Bank and Gaza and not with the authority that is 
occupying them. Jordan has been hoping that its eagerness to 
maintain the Arab nature of the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem 
in particular would be met with eagerness by the brothers in the 
Palestinian leadership to expedite bolstering future 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations on sound political and economic 
bases that reflect the cohesion between the two fraternal 
peoples--cohesion that no one can end or shatter. 
  Therefore, Jordan has the right, amid the successive 
developments in the region, to ask the brothers in Palestinian 
leadership to expedite reaching an understanding and to 
coordinate with Jordan in order to establish sound and healthy 
relations that will be in the interest of the two peoples, and 
in order to prevent the occupier from benefiting from any 
confusion that may strike these relations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Finally, Some Response"] </F>
  [Text] PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has every right to demand 
and work for the establishment of an independent Palestinian 
state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; and, we think, his people 
will eventually get what they want. But he must have realised 
by now that for the Israelis to agree to such an eventuality, 
and for the world community to bless it, the PLO leader needs to 
play his cards right, wait for a while and give priority to 
building Palestinian institutions that would be mature and 
healthy enough to deliver such a state. 
  In undertaking this major task, Mr. 'Arafat cannot afford to 
alienate everybody he knows. There are a few toes around, 
anyway, that he can step on. On the other hand, he has every 
reason to cultivate the support of especially those who are most 
ready and willing to help him achieve full rights. Jordan is on 
top of the list of those countries which not only back the 
PLO-Israel agreement, but whose national security also depends 
on the success of the accord. True, Jordan is not yet ready to 
discuss a confederation with Chairman 'Arafat, simply because 
such a link can take place only between sovereign states, but 
there is no question that the Kingdom is fully committed to 
helping our Palestinian brethren in their quest for realising 
their legitimate rights, including self-determination and 
statehood. 
  Jordan, however, has its own interests, which, incidentally 
or otherwise, in no way clash with Palestinian aspirations fo 
independence. Furthermore, what the leadership of this country 
has been asking of the PLO leader is no more than what Mr. 
'Arafat himself has been demanding of other Arabs, namely 
coordination and cooperation on vital issues. 
  It was the Palestinians who insisted right from the 
beginning 
of the Madrid talks in the fall of 1991 on full coordination 
among the Arab parties to the peace process: Jordan, Syria, 
Lebanon and the Palestinians. As a result of its secret 
agreement with Israel the PLO managed to alienate Syria and, by 
extension, Lebanon. Jordan, as the PLO is fully aware, has not 
taken such a position. To the contrary, it has forgiven Mr. 
'Arafat for reaching a separate deal with Israel, and His 
Majesty the King went as far as congratulating the PLO leader on 
his courage in reaching the Oslo accords. 
  But while Mr. 'Arafat might understandably be occupied with 
everything under the sun, he must remember that the mind of the 
Jordanian leadership is set on guarding the real interests of an 
Arab state, whose wellbeing is of vital interest to the cause of 
Palestine. Whatever agreement the Palestinians reach or fail to 
reach with the Israelis is going to have its consequences on 
Jordan. Therefore, coordination among the two parties is not a 
luxury, it is a necessity. The Palestinian leadership certainly 
realises that it has a stake in a strong Jordan both during the 
transitional period and afterwards. And that is why the arrival 
here this week of a delegation to start real coordination should 
be such a welcome change.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Putting Matters In Their Context"] </F>
  [Text] Perhaps the regrettable matters which we found 
ourselves having to stand around and talk about are matters 
which concern the disappointment that has followed every stage 
in our efforts toward an honest, real, and clear coordination 
with our brothers in the PLO. Despite all our steps on the 
ground that proceeded from the uniqueness of 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations and despite everything we took 
into consideration before taking any step toward maintaining 
this uniqueness, we found ourselves still facing suspicion, 
doubts, and questioning. Moreover, despite our concern not to 
waste time by refuting false accusations and our concern to work 
instead of getting angry, blaming, or turning our backs, our 
efforts continued to be futile and our stands continued to be 
the last to be trusted and treated clearly by some PLO leaders. 
The result was always a loss for us as a nation, a loss for us 
as one family, and a loss for us as the owners of a just cause 
in which the only requirement to achieve our rights is a sincere 
and faithful joint action that is far from any form of 
prevarication. 
  Today, as Amman witnesses another Jordanian attempt to 
compensate for the past, correct matters, and place 
Jordanian-Palestinian coordination before any useless step taken 
with the enemy, we reaffirm the importance of proceeding from 
trust and from a feeling, as we sit at one table, that the cause 
is that of a generation that has suffered a lot and that of 
generations which we cannot allow to inherit disappointment. We 
also reaffirm that national and pan-Arab concern over our rights 
requires us to feel that we are sitting together as brothers and 
not as those lying in wait for each other. Indeed, it is 
ridiculous to believe that the Israeli is closer to the 
Palestinian than the Jordanian is to the Palestinian. It is 
also ridiculous to believe that the Jordanians can trust the 
Israeli side while there are continued doubts and suspicions 
between the Jordanians and the Palestinians. No one can tear 
apart the unity of or create a substitute for this one family 
that has been united by four decades of pain, hopes, 
steadfastness, perseverance, and many dreams. Those who do not 
fear God in what they think, do, seek, or imagine achieving, or 
think it is possible to side with the enemy at the expense of 
the brother will only reap disappointment and loss. Moreover, 
they will discover too late that it is hard to continue 
deceiving others by deceiving themselves. This tragedy has not 
just begun. What we are witnessing now is the natural result of 
all those years of such an attitude.

<F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Senior officials Wednesday [5 January] 
dismissed as baseless an Israel Radio report that Jordan has 
banned the flow of agricultural produce from the Gaza Strip 
through the Kingdom. 
  "The report is totally baseless and unfounded," said Wahib 
Husayn, head of the agriculture section of the Department of 
Palestinian Affairs. 
  The flow of Palestinian agricultural produce through Jordan 
for exports continues unimpeded and "no such ban reported by the 
Israeli media has been adopted by Jordan," Mr. Husayn told the 
JORDAN TIMES. 
  Mr. Husayn as well as other officials described the report 
as 
Israeli propaganda aimed at creating trouble between Jordan and 
the Palestinians. 
  According to the Israeli report, the purported ban was 
imposed because Jordan was upset with the Palestine Liberation 
Organisation (PLO) for its lack of political coordination with 
the Kingdom. 
  Officials laughed off the report. 
  "It is another link in the chain of the Israeli-orchestrated 
campaign to poison the atmosphere between Jordan and the PLO and 
the Palestinians in the occupied territories," said a senior 
official, who preferred anonymity. 
  "There is a political decision to support the Palestinians 
living in the occupied territories to the best of Jordan's 
abilities, and there is no logic in suggesting that we are 
adopting moves contrary to that decision," added the official. 
  Ministry of Agriculture officials said routine permissions 
had already been issued, allowing fruits and vegetables from the 
Gaza Strip to enter Jordan in transit for export purposes 
between Jan. 1 and April 30, 1994, and that West Bank produce 
could enter Jordan without restraints except those in place to 
protect local produce. 
  As a rule, West Bank produce is allowed into Jordan for 
exports as well as to make up for the shortfalls in local 
production depending on season, the officials said. 
  There have been a few occasions when Jordan had no choice 
but 
to block the entry of certain products because Israelis tried to 
"sneak in" their products disguised as Palestinian products, the 
officials said, noting that allowing such items to enter Jordan 
would be in violation of the Arab boycott of Israel. 
  Jordan imports around $30 million worth of Palestinian 
products every year, including fruits and vegetables, meat 
products and olive oil as well as building stones, and does not 
impose any customs on them, considering the imports as internal 
trade. 
  Nearly 12,000 tonnes of fruits and vegetables from the West 
Bank and nearly 3,000 tonnes from the Gaza Strip entered Jordan 
during 1993, according to official figures. The bulk of the 
produce was destined for the Gulf states. 
  Israel does not allow the export of Jordanian products to 
the 
occupied territories. 
  Trade between Jordan and the occupied territories has been 
an 
issue under discussion at varying forums and stages among three 
main parties involved--Jordan, the Palestinians and Israel--in 
the 26- month-old Middle East peace process. 
  But to definite agreement has been reached since Israel has 
been trying to maintain the occupied territories as a protected 
market for its own products while seeking to impose ceilings, 
tariffs and levies on non-Israeli products, officials say.

<F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Sa'idah al-Kilani] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The Islamic Action Front (IAF) party Friday 
[31 December] elected a 16-member executive council in an 
unexpected tranquil atmosphere. The results showed the victory 
of 10 new aspirants while six incumbents retained their seats. 
Ishaq al-Farhan was reelected president of the executive 
council while 'Abd-al-Majid al-Dhunaybat was reelected as 
president of the Majlis al-Shura by acclamation. 
  The Majlis al-Shura then elected 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Shuraydah 
as its vice-president and 'Abd-al-'Aziz Jabir and Khalid 
al-Qudat as the president's assistants. 
  Only 106 out of 120 Majlis al-Shura members proceeded 
afterwards to the election of the 16 executive council members 
out of 25 candidates; eight members cast empty ballots. Leading 
members Hammam Sa'id and Muhammad Abu-Faris refused to nominate 
themselves to the council despite suggestions by many. 
  The results showed that moderates won most of the seats on 
the party's executive council. 
  The IAF is the political branch of the Muslim Brotherhood 
and 
while Brotherhood membership is not a pre-requisite for IAF 
membership, most IAF members are Brotherhood members as well. 
  A majority of IAF members, estimated by the party at between 
3,000 and 5,000, supports the moderates. 
  The new executive council and number of votes they obtained 
are as follows: 'Abd-al-Latif 'Arabiyat (78 votes), Hamzah 
Mansur (76 votes), 'Abd-al-Hamid al-Qudat (73 votes), Bassam 
al-'Umush (72 votes), 'Adnan al-Jaljuli (70 votes), Ahmad Tanash 
(69 votes), Ahmad al-Kafawin (69 votes), 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah 
(68 votes), Na'il al-Masalihah (68 voters), Muhammad 'Uwaydah 
(61 votes), Jamil Abu-Bakir (60 votes), Ibrahim al-Kilani (57 
votes), Tariq al-Tall (57 votes), Zuhayr al-Zumayli (56 votes), 
Sa'ud Abu-Mahfuz (55 votes), 'Abd-al-Rahim al-'Ukur (53 votes) 
and Ziyad Khalifah (49 votes -- a reserve member) 
  The first meeting of the council was set for next Thursday 
during which several committees will be formed, mainly a legal 
committee that will investigate into contestations raised by 
some IAF members of the results of the Shura council that took 
place last week. 
  The IAF also issued a statement in which it condemns 
Vatican's recognition of the state of Israel that "denotes the 
submission of the spiritual leadership of the Christian 
followers to the Zionist domination." 
  The statement also called on all political parties and 
groupings in the Arab and Muslim world to denounce this 
recognition.

Inclination To Merge With Action Front"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- 'Abd-al-Majid Dhunaybat, 
deputy controller general of the Muslim Brotherhood group in 
Jordan, has denied the existence of internal differences over a 
proposal from the planning section for the dissolution of the 
group in order to merge it with the Islamic Action Front [IAF]. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday, Dhunaybat 
said: This matter has become just an excuse. The fact is that 
there is nothing but a number of options which some thought 
should be studied, but they were not presented as a proposal. 
  He added: Every brother has a right to make suggestions and 
to think, but the option of dissolving the group and replacing 
it with a political party was never proposed. 
  Dhunaybat played down the dismissal of Ziyad Abu-Ghunaymah 
from the group, pointing out that he was dismissed for reasons 
of misconduct. Abu-Ghunaymah had been dismissed from the group 
while on a visit to the United States but he remained an IAF 
member. 
  A new IAF executive bureau, Shura Council chairman, and 
secretary general are due to be elected today. 
  Dhunaybat had earlier denied that the group had nominated 
anyone for the parliamentary elections held recently.

<F P=106> [Special to the JORDAN TIMES by Suhayr 'Ubaydat] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Six leftist political parties Monday [3 
January] criticised the JD [Jordanian dinars] 1,487 billion 
draft budget for 1994 and called on the Lower House of 
Parliament to reject it. 
  A joint statement issued by the six said the draft budget, 
which is under study by the Finance Committee of the House, 
placed the greater burden of economic reform on the poor and 
thus deepened the gap between the rich and poor. 
  The statement, a copy of which was made available to the 
JORDAN TIMES, was signed by the Jordanian Communist Party, the 
communist Arab Ba'th Party, the Jordanian Popular Unity Party, 
the Jordanian Democratic People's Party (Hashd), the Jordanian 
Socialist Democratic Party and the Jordanian Democratic Arab 
Party. 
  It called on the House to reject the draft budget, presented 
to parliament in mid-December by Finance Minister Sami Qammuh, 
and "defend the people's right to their daily bread," 
  Listing its own version of the objectives of the country's 
economic policy, the statement said that economic development in 
the past two years did not justify the increase in local 
revenues (mainly from indirect taxes and fees). 
  The statement asserted that the expected introduction of a 
sales tax would "increase the production costs of the local 
industries and lead to a general price increase in market, and 
raise the poverty line..." 
  Other byproducts of the sales tax, according to the 
statement, will be a decline in demand for local products and 
investment and an increase in unemployment. 
  The statement called for a link between prices and wages and 
a minimum level of wages "in accordance with all related studies 
of living costs and the poverty line." 
  It claimed that the increase in the income and profit taxes 
came mainly from shareholding companies and employees, "which 
indicates that the percentage of tax evasion is still very high." 
  On expenditure, the statement claims that there is no 
serious 
attempt to reduce the deficit by decreasing expenditure, "rather 
it is about increasing revenues while maintaining the level of 
expenditure." 
  The statement said that the budget is not "deficit-free" as 
described by Mr. Qammuh, but that there is a deficit of JD 450 
million "to be covered by local and foreign aid and loans." 
  The statement concluded by some suggestions to "treat the 
economic situation and the budget, including an increase in the 
salaries of active and retired civil servants and the military." 
  In his daily column which appeared in the Arabic daily 
AL-RA'Y Monday economist Fahd al-Fanik accused those advocating 
an increase in salaries as being "irresponsible." 
  He said that there is no guarantee that the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) will reschedule Jordan's debts "regardless 
of our adherence to the economic reform programme, which 
includes decreasing the budget deficit."

  [Text] Amman--Jordan and the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) have finalised a standby agreement for the year 1994 as 
part of the economic restructuring programme the Kingdom is 
following since 1989, informed sources said Tuesday [4 January]. 
  They said the main undertaking in the agreement was the 
introduction of a sales tax to replace a consumption tax before 
the end of next month and a reaffirmation of the Kingdom's moves 
to revamp the energy sector to make it cost-efficient. 
  The sources said no price increase of any commodity or fuel 
was envisaged in the letter of intent Jordan submitted to the 
IMF on the basis of which the standby agreement was finalised. 
The sources could not say whether the agreement was actually 
signed by the finance minister. 
  The accord now goes before the board of governors of the IMF 
and, immediately after approval, clears the way for Jordan to 
open fresh debt rescheduling talks with the Paris Club of 
creditor governments in February. 
  An IMF certification that a debtor country is following an 
economic restructuring programme is essential before 
international creditors agree to hold debt rescheduling talks. 
  The IMF green signal for Jordan will also clear the way for 
the Kingdom to seek external financing to service its debts, 
estimated to cost around $400 million. The financing is 
expected to be raised with help from the World Bank which 
convened a donors conference which produced $390 million in 
assistance to Jordan for the year 1993. 
  According to the sources, apart from undertaking to 
introduce 
the sales tax, the government renewed its commitment to ensuring 
that the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA) would be 
self-sufficient by the year 1995. 
  To achieve this end by improving the performance of the 
semi-autonomous JEA and developing the energy sector in general, 
the World Bank has extended an $80 million loan supported by a 
matching loan from the Japanese Government. 
  "No other major measures are envisaged in the standby 
agreement other than reaffirmation of Jordan's economic targets 
as set out in the restructuring programme," said a source 
familar with the negotiations that led to the finalisation of 
the document. 
  The source noted that Jordan has already complied with the 
IMF requirements of raising fuel prices and reducing subsidies 
among other measures envisaged in the economic restructuring 
programme.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) Tuesday [4 
January] announced the lifting of a ceiling on fresh credits 
that commercial banks could extend to exporters. 
  In a statement carried by the Jordan News Agency, PETRA, CBJ 
Governor Muhammad Sa'id al-Nabulsi said the management of the 
commercial banks could determine the volume of fresh credits 
they could grant to exporters. 
  The move, Dr. al-Nabulsi explained, means that the credits 
that banks may extend to exporters are not bound by the general 
ceiling on fresh credits during the year as agreed by the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the economic restructuring 
programme under way in Jordan. 
  He said the move came as part of the government's efforts to 
encourage exports and was adopted in light of "the positive 
changes witnessed in the monetary sector to conform to the CBJ's 
tendency to have indirect controls over credits facilities 
through the use of new monetary means such as certificates of 
deposits in Jordanian dinars." 
  Another recent move by the government to encourage exporters 
was the exemption of up to 70 per cent of exporters' profits 
from income tax. 
  Banking officials said they had received a CBJ circular 
informing of the relaxed credit regulations, which took effect 
as of Jan. 1, 1994. 
  Dr. al-Nabulsi said the new regulations also replace earlier 
standing rules which restricted banks from extending loans to 
not more than 10 times their capital and reserves. 
  In the context of credits for exporters known as packing 
credit in banking terms, the total amount extended should not 
exceed 90 per cent of the bank's reserves. 
  The general ceiling on fresh commercial credits set by the 
IMF for the year was JD 400 million--JD 335 million for the 
private sector and the rest for the public sector. 
  But the ceiling was broken as a result of high demand--the 
total of fresh commercial credit extended hit JD 360 million in 
the first seven months of the year--prompting the CBJ to 
introduce a series of restrictive measures. 
  The measures included the limits related to capital and 
reserves of commercial banks and the banks' involvement in 
trading in the Amman Financial Market. 
  Subsequently, the CBJ sought a higher ceiling and got IMF 
approval for another JD 60 million that could be extended during 
the last quarter of 1993 at a rate of JD 20 million per month. 
Banks which had already broken the ceiling were excluded from 
the addition. 
  However, bankers said the additional credit came too late 
for 
the market to utilise it since the financial year was drawing to 
a close. 
  The ceiling is set as a percentatge of the gross domestic 
product for the previous year. 
  The government has been trying to exclude credits extended 
for industrial investment from the ceiling, arguing that such 
investment had contributed to economic growth and would be 
reflected in terms of increase in the gross domestic product. 
  But the IMF argued that it was too early for such an 
exemption since Jordan was in the early stages of implementing 
the economic restructuring programme. 
  It was likely that the IMF would respond positively to the 
Jordanian request at a later stage in the second phase (1993-98) 
of the restructuring programme.

  [Text] Amman (AP)--Defence lawyers Sunday [2 January] 
rested their case in the trial of 10 Jordanians accused of 
plotting to kill King Husayn, rejecting pretrial confessions and 
demanding the conditional release of the defendants. 
  Defence lawyer 'Umar Damrah, reading a 150-page summation, 
argued that the confessions were extracted under torture and as 
such could not be admitted as evidence. 
  He demanded that the court return an innocent verdict and 
release the defendants. 
  The State Security Court, a three-man military tribunal, 
will 
hold a "final review" of the case Jan. 9 and set a date for 
issuing the verdict, prosecution sources said. 
  Under standing orders of the court, the defendants and 
witnesses could not be identified by name in media reports. Two 
of the accused are being tried in absentia. 
  Five military cadets, a member of a guard unit of King 
Husayn 
and four others, including the two fugitives, are charged with 
plotting to assassinate the Monarch and pave the way for a 
take-over of power by the illegal Hizb al-Tahrir group. 
  Hizb al-Tahrir, a puritan group established in the early 
50's, does not recognise any of the existing Arab governments 
and calls for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate. 
  The prosecution charges that the five cadets, students at 
Mu'ta University, a military college in south Jordan, were 
enlisted by Hizb al-Tahrir to open fire at the King during a 
guard of honour at a Mu'ta graduation ceremony on June 26. 
  The students were told that as soon as the King was killed, 
pre-positioned Hizb al-Tahrir members were to take over radio 
and television stations and seize power, according to prosector 
Muhammad Hijazi, an army major. 
  Mr. Damrah and other defence lawyers who addressed the court 
last week summed up that the accused were subject to "severe 
physical torture and psychological duress" to force them into 
signing the confessions. 
  The statements, given by the eight accused during three 
months of detention at the intelligence department, are one of 
the pillars of the prosecution's case. 
  All the defendants in court retracted the confessions and 
entered innocent pleas at the outset of the trial, which began 
in September. 
  The defence has also argued that Hizb al-Tahrir did not 
espouse violence as a means to achieve its objective, and as 
such the prosecution charges based on the group's ideology were 
invalid. 
  Prosecution witnesses have testified that the five cadets 
were devout Muslims who resented the pro-western "un-Islamic" 
policies of the government. 
  They also told the court that the five were ardent admirers 
of Lieutnant Khalid al-Islambuli, who assassinated Egyptian 
president Anwar al-Sadat Husni Mubarak [name as published] 
during a Cairo military parade in October 1981.

<F P=106> [Sana' al-Imam report from Damascus] </F>
  [Text] Syria has expressed the hope that the 
Clinton-al-Asad summit will produce positive results. Vice 
President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam says that following Israel's 
agreement with the PLO, Syria informed the U.S. side that it did 
not agree to resume negotiations because Oslo constituted a 
deviation from the Madrid formula. However, subsequent contacts 
were held and an agreement was reached on a meeting between 
Presidents Clinton and al-Asad in Geneva, he added. 
  Khaddam asserted that Syria's position continues to be clear 
and the same, that peace must lead to implementing UN 
resolutions and to a comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied 
Arab territories. 
  Khaddam criticized the Israeli-Arab meetings under the name 
of multilaterals and repeated Syria's position on them. He 
indicated that such issues should not be discussed before the 
issue of peace and Israeli withdrawal is settled. Khaddam said 
Syria does not feel that it is weak otherwise it would not have 
gone to the peace negotiations. This is because the weak would 
enter negotiations at his expense and at the expense of his 
land, as he put it. 
  The Syrian vice president criticized the Oslo agreement, 
stressing the importance of a comprehensive solution on all 
fronts of struggle and said: Many attempts have been made to 
reach solutions with Syria for Syrian territory only. Syria 
rejected all these attempts because it is convinced of the 
pan-Arab nature of the struggle and the need for a comprehensive 
solution.

  [Text] Gentlemen: Israel has blocked all the roads in the 
face of the peace march and prevented 1993 from becoming the 
year of the desired just and comprehensive peace in the region. 
Our region, however, is looking to 1994 with a ray of hope 
created by the decision to hold a summit meeting late this month 
between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
Much has been said about the importance of this meeting to 
peace prospects in the region, especially since it will take 
place in an atmosphere of foundering unilateral deals -- deals 
which are being sought by Israel as an alternative to the 
comprehensive peace that Syria and the whole world are calling 
for. 
  Indubitably, U.S. President Bill Clinton would not have 
arranged this meeting if he does not have anything new to 
justify efforts to push the peace process forward and to revive 
the peoples' hopes that the required peace will prevail. Syria 
has always been eager to know if the U.S. Administration, which 
has opted to play the role of a full and effective partner in 
the peace process, has anything new to offer, especially since 
Syria has clarified its firm positions, as well as reiterated 
its adherence to peace and its refusal to relinquish any right. 
  This prompts many in the region, and throughout the world, 
to 
pin great hopes on the results of this summit. Many also fear, 
at the same time, that intrigues may be contrived before and 
during this summit to hamper efforts to reach such results. 
This, in fact, explains the expectations being spread these 
days that Israel may fabricate incidents, create tension before 
the summit, and prevent the realization of the hopes pinned to 
it. 
  Everyone knows that Israel will not be pleased to see 
efforts 
to strengthen relations between Syria and the United States or 
efforts to activate the U.S. role in achieving what Washington 
has committed itself to in accordance with the initiative it 
launched in Madrid, namely, the establishment of a just and 
comprehensive peace in accordance with the resolutions of the 
international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. 
  Everyone also knows the identity of those who are launching 
a 
feverish campaign against Syria, as well as the lies that these 
sides, which are known for their loyalty to Israel and the 
Zionist circles, are spreading against Syria in order to distort 
its reputation and affect world public opinion. They are 
particularly interested in damaging U.S. public opinion, which 
has begun to show more understanding of Syria's positions, its 
seriousness about peace, and its eagerness to establish peace on 
firm bases that will perpetuate the peace. This cannot be 
achieved without the comprehensive and just approach that Syria 
has been stressing. 
  These sides have been spreading their poisons since the 
summit was announced. The beginning of the campaign appeared in 
the questions journalists posed to U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher when he announced the planned summit during a 
news conference in Damascus. The Syrian foreign minister 
described the questions at that time as prefabricated, and 
Christopher refused to answer them. 
  In light of the failure of that campaign, which, as we have 
said, is backed by Israel and the supporters of its deception 
abroad, and amid the confusion and failure of unilateral deals, 
we are seeing expectations and fears that Israel and its 
supporters may resort to more wicked and effective ways to 
fabricate problems and create tension in the region in order to 
block the ray of hope emanating from the upcoming 
Syrian-American summit. 
  By this, we do not want to overestimate Israel's capability 
and potential. However, paying attention to such possibilities 
will certainly help contain them and deprive Israel of any 
chance. Israel appears determined to continue its policy, which 
has proven to be a total failure, and to abort the great 
prospects that the Syrian-American summit will provide by 
opening the door for a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Commenting on the awaited summit between President 
Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton, AL-BA'TH says: 
Arab and foreign political quarters and news media have 
continued to talk about the awaited summit between Presidents 
al-Asad and Clinton. These quarters have stressed the importance 
of this summit for the peace process, noting what it could offer 
to achieve a just, comprehensive peace in the region if the U.S. 
Administration shows understanding of the facts of the conflict 
in the region. As these quarters believe, it is no longer 
acceptable for the U.S. position to remain within a theoretical 
framework. This is especially so, since the U.S. Administration 
is the party that launched the peace process on the basis of UN 
resolutions and the principle of land for peace. 
  More than two years have passed since the peace process was 
launched. Israel, however, has continued to play the same role, 
namely, refusing to comply with international resolutions and 
the foundations of the peace process. This resulted in wasting 
an opportunity deemed by observers as historic when the Madrid 
conference convened and then resumed in Washington. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Unlike the Arab parties, Israel went to the 
Madrid conference and the Washington talks not to commit itself 
to the foundations of the Madrid conference but to exploit the 
peace talks to achieve its aims which it has sought for a long 
time through various means. Therefore, the peace talks have not 
made progress because of this Israeli attitude. 
  The paper thinks that the recent U.S. move came after the 
U.S. Administration felt that the entire peace process was in 
danger, especially since it is now convinced -- this is apparent 
through official statements -- that partial, separate solutions 
would never achieve genuine peace. 
  Consequently, AL-BA'TH adds, the U.S. Administration insists 
always that comprehensive settlement in the region would bring 
peace, security, and stability to the region and that any peace 
without Syria and Lebanon is not considered peace. The summit 
between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton this month comes against 
this background. It is presumed, as Arab and foreign quarters 
point out, that this summit will focus on the need to salvage 
the peace process which is threatened by Israel's position. 
These quarters assert, moreover, that it all depends on the 
U.S. Administration's position, especially since Syria has a 
very clear position on the peace process and is very much 
concerned about achieving a just and comprehensive settlement.

  [Text] Gentlemen: Israeli officials have expressed hope 
that the expected talks between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton in Geneva in the middle of this month 
will result in tangible progress that will help implement the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement on which negotiations were held in 
Oslo. The objective of the Israeli officials' insinuations is 
to place part of the blame on Syria for the stumbling of the 
aforementioned agreement. Syria, along with the world, truly 
wants to push along the peace process in the Middle East on 
entrenched, just, and comprehensive bases. However, it did not 
act to foil the Oslo agreement, especially since it bears enough 
defects and gaps to preclude its own succeed. The agreement, as 
everyone knows, has provoked Palestinians inside and outside the 
occupied Arab territories. It has also provoked Arab feelings. 
This agreement has seriously relinquished the national rights 
of an entire people, given the Israelis a free hand in the 
occupied territories, ignored Jerusalem and the issue of 
settlements, and constituted a serious precedent in the region. 
The Arab parties participating in the Madrid conference and 
Washington talks have agreed on a just and comprehensive peace 
based on the implementation of the UN Security Council 
resolutions on all the fronts of the conflict in a way that 
restores the usurped rights and all the occupied territories. 
The agreement did not ignore the Palestinian people only, but 
it also ignored all the Arabs in general, and Syria, Lebanon, 
and Jordan in particular. It is natural that many sides have 
expressed reservations on this agreement, especially since it 
constitutes a separate deal that essentially conflicts with the 
bases of a just and comprehensive peace agreed upon at the 
Damascus, Amman, and Beirut meetings. 
  The truth is that the events that have occurred since the 
signing of the agreement, including the recent lengthy talks in 
Taba, Oslo, Paris, and Cairo, have revealed to all sides that 
the Palestinian side was dragged into a well-planned trap. No 
sooner had the Israelis hinted at some temptations than it 
hastened to sign an ambiguous agreement, which seeks to achieve 
peace in appearance, but in essence, it seeks to entrench 
occupation and settlements, and to subjugate the Palestinian 
people to further pressure and coercion. The withdrawal from 
Gaza and Jericho has turned into a redeployment of forces, the 
Jericho District has turned into a small, isolated, and besieged 
city, and the self-rule into a true ghetto through which the 
Israelis control the border, the crossings, the roads, and the 
strategic areas, and fully monitor the Palestinians' movements. 
  Despite the recent tough negotiations to give some positive 
attributes to a negative agreement, the Israelis did not budge 
an inch. As the Palestinian side admitted, they were dictating 
their terms and deciding what should be and what should not be. 
So, the stumbling of the Gaza-Jericho plan is attributed to two 
main things; namely, to the serious defects it contains, and the 
Israelis' intransigence. 
  The truth is that by concluding such a separate deal, 
Israel sought to deal a blow to the entire peace process which 
started in Madrid and continued in Washington, through 
torpedoing its bases and excluding the UN Security Council 
resolutions adopted as its basis. This is because Israel does 
not want to withdraw from the occupied territories. It believes 
that occupation and peace can go together. Based on this, it 
refused to withdraw its forces from Gaza and Jericho and 
negotiated with the Palestinian side on every meter in the 
Jericho area. The relevant question is: If Jericho required 
all these negotiations, taking into consideration that it is a 
small town, how would the case be concerning the big Palestinian 
cities in the West Bank. It is fully clear to everyone that the 
Israeli intransigence, which uses security as a cover, seeks to 
entrench occupation, usurpation, expansion, and settlements. 
The intransigence we see in the Oslo agreement negotiations is 
only part of Israel's multifarious maneuverings, which are aimed 
at foiling the entire peace process. 
  Israel is blackmailing the Palestinian side in a very 
serious 
manner. It is also exploiting its weakness, which was the 
result of its deviation from Arab consensus and involvement in 
partial and separate settlements, in order to dictate to it on 
its humiliating terms. If we have lessons to learn from this 
stumbling agreement, then we clearly see that Israel is utterly 
separated from peace and that it has not yet dissociated itself 
from the objectives of expansion and settlements. This issue 
will certainly be discussed by Presidents al-Asad and Clinton in 
Geneva. All past events proved that peace in the region hinges 
on Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied territories and on 
the restoration of all Arab rights. No agreement will be of any 
value, regardless of the propaganda surrounding it, if it is not 
just and fair and if it does not meet Arab aspirations to 
restore their rights and territories. In fact, such agreement 
will turn into an obstacle to peace. 
  Syria has frequently said that peace goes with justice, and 
that peace and occupation cannot go together. If Israel refuses 
to free itself of delusions and expansionist plans in order to 
move to the world of peace, right, and justice, then the 
international community will be required to assume its 
responsibilities -- to clarify matters and to take whatever 
steps are necessary to implement its resolutions and to end the 
Israeli intransigence. Peace is the issue of all peoples, and 
an aggressive entity must not be allowed to endanger mankind as 
a result of its insistence on its aggressive course.

  [Text] Gentlemen: The heads of the Syrian and Lebanese 
delegations to the peace talks are holding preliminary 
consultations with the U.S. Administration in Washington on the 
overall peace process and the obstacles facing it on the Syrian 
and Lebanese tracks. These consultations are also aimed at 
exploring the possibilities for activating the stalled 
negotiations in light of the full and fair partner role that the 
United States has pledged to play. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher proposed these 
preliminary consultations as part of other measures designed to 
end the stalemate in the peace process. It is noteworthy that 
even before the ink on the Oslo agreement dried, Israel 
announced that it was not presently interested in promoting the 
peace efforts on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. Israel also 
said that peace was achieved in the region in the wake of the 
Oslo agreement, and that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks can wait. 
  The Israeli deception did not last long because this 
agreement remained mere ink on paper. Moreover, the 
contradictions of this agreement soon surfaced, and Syria once 
again occupies a prominent position. Syria's role will continue 
to be a central one because it is essential to both the peace 
process and the Middle East region. 
  The United States acknowledged Syria's basic role when it 
sent its secretary of state to the region in order to discuss 
rescuing the peace process, and also when it arranged for the 
upcoming summit in Geneva between President Hafiz al-Asad and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  It is natural for the Israelis to cast doubt on the 
Syrian-U.S. summit, just as they usually do. The Israelis are 
looking forward to encircling and belittling the Syrian role and 
undermining the possibility of a deep Syrian-U.S. understanding 
on the aspired Middle East peace and on the need to establish it 
on firm bases, so it would stand fast in the face of various 
events and developments. 
  The Israelis widely publicized the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
However, the events that followed this agreement have shown that 
this agreement is a group of ambiguous principles and that 
reaching further agreements on these principles would need 
months of painstaking negotiations. Events have also shown that 
the peace process has retreated several steps backward instead 
of moving one step forward, and that there is no alternative to 
the return to the bases of the Madrid conference, the Washington 
talks, and the formula of a just and comprehensive peace on all 
tracks of the conflict, based on both the Security Council 
resolutions and the principle of exchanging land for peace. 
  As the Gaza-Jericho agreement faces a real impasse, the 
Israelis have appealed to the United States to intercede with 
Syria in order to render this agreement a success. It is to be 
recalled that this agreement has carried the seeds of failure 
since the very beginning because it is a separate deal, which 
conflicts with the objective of a just and comprehensive peace, 
and it does not achieve the Palestinian people's rights. 
Moreover, Israel has shown great intransigence and arrogance, 
thus increasing the conviction that it does not want to withdraw 
from the occupied territories and that it is using the agreement 
to strike at the intifadah -- with Palestinian hands if possible. 
  Thus, the demonstrated Israeli desire for Syrian flexibility 
are no more than deception. Israel was the party that lured the 
Palestinian side into concluding a separate deal. Israel is 
also the party that imposes its condition on the Palestinian 
side and refuses to show any flexibility. As was the case two 
years ago, Israel stands as an obstacle to the opportunities of 
a just and comprehensive peace in the region. 
  Syria, along with other Arabs, has called on Israel to 
achieve a just, comprehensive, and honorable solution based on a 
principle on which the world was unanimous; namely, the exchange 
of land for peace. In return for Israeli withdrawal from all 
occupied territories, Israel would reap the fruit of peace on 
all tracks without exception. Contrary to its allegations, 
Israel's withdrawal does not entitle it to concessions because 
the occupied territories are Arab lands, and because the 
Security Council resolutions provide for withdrawal and frankly 
reject occupation, annexation, and the building of settlements. 
  Since the Washington talks began, however, Israel has 
undermined all the opportunities for a real peace, rejected 
various offers and proposals, and insisted on the policy of 
separate deals. This policy can make neither peace nor even a 
truce. Hence, both the resumption of the Washington talks and 
the activation of the march toward a comprehensive Middle East 
peace depend on Israel. 
  Neither Syria nor Lebanon will listen to Israel to conclude 
separate deals. Israel, however, will receive a favorable 
response if it really seeks an honorable, comprehensive, and 
just peace. We do not believe that any world state, including 
the United States, differs with Syrian opinion on the need to 
establish a just and comprehensive peace. All parties now agree 
that there will be no peace if it is not a just and 
comprehensive one. This is the significance of both the 
preliminary talks in Washington and the upcoming Syrian-U.S. 
summit. As has been the case since the convening of the Madrid 
conference, the ball remains solely in the Israeli court.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] The newspaper AL-BA'TH says: Regional developments 
have shown the soundness and precision of the Syrian position 
toward the Middle East peace process. Syria believes that the 
desired peace can only be achieved within the context of 
international legitimacy and the Arab unity of ranks. Likewise, 
Syria believes that this peace must ensure the restoration of 
all Arab territorial and political rights. There should be 
neither abandonment of any such rights, nor bargaining over any 
such rights. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: These principles could have created an 
international pressure that might have made the Zionist entity 
abandon its provocative and intransigent positions. Such 
pressure could also have created the propitious objective 
circumstances needed to achieve just and comprehensive peace. 
However, these principles have been immensely undermined by the 
PLO's decision to depart from Arab consensus and jump to deals 
with Israel, believing that this unilateral approach, which was 
manifested in the conclusion of the Gaza-Jericho accord, would 
help it make some gains. However, what has happened is quite 
the opposite. For, the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have 
confirmed that it is only Israel which emerged as the winner. 
The Oslo agreement has begun to collapse under Zionist 
pressures. Even the flawed and fragile autonomy accord appears 
to be rejected by the Israelis. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: These 
fast-breaking regional developments have revealed the cards of 
all parties to the peace process. They have shown that any 
attempts to violate the principles of peace is doomed to 
failure, and that any such attempts will hurt the Arabs' 
pan-Arab interests. All this highlights Syria's redemptive role 
in this crucial phase of the Arab nation's history, and renders 
the imminent Geneva summit, due to be held between Presidents 
Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton, an important opportunity for 
ending the stalemate plaguing the peace process. 
  For its part, the newspaper TISHRIN addresses the world's 
hopes for the success of the Syrian-U.S. summit due to be held 
in Geneva in mid-January, as well as the disappointment caused 
by the consequences of the Oslo agreement. 
  TISHRIN says: Israeli Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer 
has inaugurated a new neighborhood in the Qatzrin settlement in 
the occupied Syrian Golan. The Israeli minister pledged to work 
to promote and expand Zionist settlements in the Golan, 
something which shows that this provocative act is part of 
efforts to scuttle the peace process, sabotage the U.S. peace 
initiative, thwart the al-Asad-Clinton summit in advance, and 
present to the United States and the world community a fait 
accompli. 
  TISHRIN adds: Since the signing of the Oslo accord, Israel 
has attempted to delude the world in general and the United 
States in particular into believing that peace has been realized 
in the region, that the Palestine question has been resolved, 
and that peace efforts on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks can 
wait. Likewise, it has striven to marginalize Syria's role, 
obscure the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and 
promote separate deals, such as the Gaza-Jericho accord, instead 
of comprehensive peace. 
  TISHRIN goes on to say: However, deception was short-lived. 
For Secretary of State Christopher has commended Syria's 
primary role in the peace process and arranged a summit between 
Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. Since the news of the summit 
was announced, the Israelis have been casting doubts on its 
usefulness and leaking deceptive reports on an alleged Syria 
role in this or that incident. In the aftermath of the failure 
of their maneuvers in this regard, they have initiated a 
provocation that has taken the form of encouraging Zionist 
settlers to settle in the Golan and pledging aid to expand the 
existing settlements in the hope of confusing the Clinton 
Administration. 
  TISHRIN indicates that the entire world is fully aware that 
Middle East peace cannot be achieved in the absence of an 
effective Syrian involvement, and that peace with Syria is 
contingent upon the restoration of all occupied Golan territory, 
and the dismantlement of settlements there. 
  Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: The Golan is Syrian 
territory, and will remain so regardless of how many settlements 
Israel builds there. Moreover, Syria will not abandon a single 
inch of Golan territory. Certainly, there will be neither a 
regional peace, nor a peace with Syria unless all Golan 
territory is returned to its rightful owners. 
  The newspaper AL-THAWRAH addresses the Oslo agreement, which 
was concluded more than four months ago, saying that it has 
failed to produce any tangible results. The regional 
developments which have unfolded since the signing of the accord 
have shown that the accord has failed to bring peace to the 
Palestinian people or the region, the paper argues. Worse 
still, by way of this accord, Israel has managed to dissociate 
the PLO from the Palestinian people and its pan-Arab depth and 
surroundings, namely, Syria and other frontline Arab states. 
This accord has, indeed, legimitized Israel's aggression and 
occupation. The alleged differences being promoted on the 
provisions of the Oslo deal, the interpretations and 
implementation of this deal, and the intransigent PLO and 
Israeli stands are all parts of a campaign of contrived 
maneuvering and deception designed to promote the credibility of 
both Israel and the PLO with their constituencies after the deal 
has failed to bring the region closer to peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Under all circumstances, the PLO looks like 
the only loser. As for the Palestinian people and Arabs, they 
are also big losers in all this. This is because the Oslo 
agreement consecrates the final liquidation of the Palestine 
question and replaces the Palestinian people's aspirations, as 
well as their legitimate right to build an independent state on 
Palestinian national soil, with control over a municipality 
whose borders will remain confined to the area of Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH notes the approach of 
Rabin, who is humiliating the PLO and its leaders by reiterating 
the intransigent Israeli positions with regard to control over 
border crossings and security and negotiations on Israeli terms. 
If Israeli terms and positions are not accepted by the PLO, his 
government is not in a hurry to conclude an agreement with it, 
as Rabin put it. All this shows the futility of unilateral 
deals, as well as their failure to bring just and comprehensive 
peace, which must result in complete Israeli withdrawal on all 
fronts.

  [Text] New information has surfaced about the attempt to 
assassinate President Ilyas al-Hirawi, the official denial of 
this attempt not withstanding. 
  Judge Riyad Tali' has issued an arrest warrant against Gh. 
T., formerly a security official in one of the militias, and two 
of his assistants, Sayid Sh. and Tony J. 
  The military authorities have also arrested a military man, 
Shirfan B., who plotted with the above suspects to assassinate 
President al-Hirawi when he was living in the temporary 
presidential residency in al-Ramlah al-Bayda' [in West Beirut]. 
  Shirfan, an officer candidate in the Lebanese Army, agreed 
to 
work for Gh. T. in return for a sum of money. He constantly 
submitted reports on the activity of the presidential office, 
the details of the president's office and bedroom, and the times 
when he was present in his office. He also gave information on 
the names of the officers and members of presidential guard. 
  Judicial sources said Shirfan and Tony confessed under 
interrogation that Tony introduced Shirfan to Gh. T. and 
conferred with him several times in Burj al-Fidar in Jubayl. 
GH. T. explained to Shirfan how to place an explosive device in 
the president's office, either by booby-trapping the telephone 
or by putting the explosive device in a flower pot. Gh. T. 
promised Shirfan to give him a sum of money and to secure his 
travel to the United States.

  [Text] Beirut, Jan 4 (AFP)--A storm has broken out over a 
Muslim cleric's call for a mosque to be built on the site where 
the Lebanese believe Jesus Christ turned water into wine in his 
first miracle. 
  The controversy comes five months ahead of a planned visit 
by 
Pope John Paul II. 
  Shaykh Ja'far al-Sayigh, a Shiite Muslim cleric in Qana, 
said 
over the weekend that a mosque should be built above a cave 
there which many Lebanese revere as the site where Christ 
changed water into wine during a wedding. 
  His call has also revived a centuries' old debate on whether 
the biblical Qana was located in Lebanon, east of the southern 
port of Tyre, or in the Galilee region of what is now northern 
Israel. 
  House Speaker Nabih Birri said that he took proof of the 
Lebanese claim when he was received by the pope in November at 
the Vatican. 
  Birri condemned the shaykh's call saying it was "very far 
from our traditions, our habits, our Islam and our Christianity." 
  "Qana is a symbol for us and we refuse to let it become a 
meeting place for extremism and fanaticism," he said. 
  Muslim clerics and Christian dignitaries have rallied to 
Birri's side. 
  "We must preserve the historical sites in the region of Qana 
al-Jalil, which represents a meeting place for the Christian and 
Muslim religions," said Shaykh Ali al-Amin, president of the 
Imam al-Sadr Institute for Islamic Studies. 
  He called on the inhabitants of Qana "to close ranks" 
against 
the mosque proposal. 
  "Land where Christ walked becomes sacred and we must 
preserve 
it," the cleric said. 
  The head of the Catholic Church in Tyre, Monsignor Yuhanna 
Haddad, praised Birri's position. 
  And the parish priest in Qana, Mikha'il 'Abbud, said troops 
were deployed around the cave over the weekend to protect the 
site. 
  The pope announced on December 21 plans to visit Lebanon in 
the first half of 1994. Vatican sources said the visit might 
take place in May or June. The pontiff is expected to visit 
south Lebanon during his visit. 
  [Beirut Radio Lebanon at 1630 GMT on 4 January adds the 
following: "Sidon's Ja'farite mufti Sayyid Muhammad Hasan 
al-Amin called on Shaykh Ja'far al-Sayigh and his aides to 
reconsider their decision to build a mosque in front of the 
historical cave of Qana to safeguard national coexistence, 
especially as the south has always embraced both Christian and 
Muslim values." 
  [In a related item in the same cast, the radio adds: 
"Chamber of Deputies member Muhammad Qabbani has denounced 
recent incidents that occurred in the south and the north under 
the guise of religion, stressing that they were provoked by 
ignoramuses, not people of faith." 
  [Elsewhere, Beirut Voice of Lebanon in Arabic at 1715 GMT on 
4 January reports: "Minister of State Jean 'Ubayd today praised 
Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri's opposition to 
extremism and to what Birri described as waves of insanity. 
  ["'Ubayd said Speaker Birri's stand against overzealousness 
and extremism expresses his patriotic and pan-Arab policy. 
Minister 'Ubayd called for reviving wisdom, strength, unity, 
and dignity in this country and nation. He called for silencing 
such voices and all those involved in schemes to partition the 
country and provoke infighting. 'Ubayd said he believes the 
state must prepare to confront such schemes by forging greater 
solidarity among its institutions and acting firmly and sternly 
against anyone who threatens the state's security, the 
homeland's unity, and the country's sanctities, liberties, and 
taboos."]

  The central bank, in a statement, said the new exchange rate 
was fixed at 39.97 taka for buying and 40.17 taka for selling, 
effective Sunday, a normal working day in Muslim Bangladesh. 
The previous rates were 39.75 taka and 39.99 taka. 
  The FINANCIAL EXPRESS newspaper said that although the taka 
was "very stable," the devaluation would minimise the trade gap 
and increase exports. 
  In the year to December 1993, the taka was devalued by two 
per cent, the newspaper said.

Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i. 
  Szimkus was arrested in Iran in 1989 and was sentenced to 
death for spying for Baghdad in 1992. The German has allegedly 
confessed to having spied for Iraq. Foreign Minister Klaus 
Kinkel has appealed to Iran on the condemned man's behalf.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 5, IRNA -- Death sentence on German 
national, Helmut Szimkus, arrested and convicted of spying for 
Iraq two years ago has been upheld by the Supreme Court, 
Prosecutor General Ayatollah Abolfazl Musavi Tabrizi said here 
Wednesday. 
  "Only the leader of the Islamic revolution Ayatollah 'Ali 
Khamene'i can pardon him (Szimkus)," Musavi Tabrizi told 
reporters. 
  A German delegation headed by Deputy Justice Minister Rainer 
Funke arrived in Iran a few months ago to request clemency for 
the German spy from Iranian officials. 
  The prosecutor general said that Funke's request that German 
spy be pardoned has not been sent to the leader of the Islamic 
revolution for his decision. 
  On anti-narcotics campaign, Ayatollah Musavi Tabrizi said 
that a special joint law enforcement and army unit has succeeded 
in tightly controlling the borders and preventing entry of 
international drug traffickers and narcotic drugs. 
  He added that 70 percent of prisoners have been convicted of 
drug related offences. 
  The ayatollah said that poppy cultivation in Pakistan and 
Afghanistan, bordering Iran on the east, was one of the main 
reasons for smuggling in of these drugs to Iran and added that 
Islamabad and Kabul governments should pay careful attention to 
the destructive outcome of poppy cultivation. 
  Ayatollah Musavi Tabrizi added that by sealing off Iran's 
eastern borders, 70 percent of the anti-narcotics campaign has 
been completed.

  Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan urged Iran to renew 
its efforts to end the five-year war over the breakaway 
Armenian-majority enclave of Karabakh in western Azerbaijan. 
  Azeri Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov also asked Iran, during 
a visit in December, to help end the conflict which has cost 
some 15,000 lives. 
  Iran, which has its own Azeri population of 10 million and 
an 
Armenian community of 250,000, tried but failed to end the 
conflict in 1992, and has since repeatedly offered to mediate. 
  Fighting in the enclave flared in 1988. After a year of 
military defeats, the Azeri army launched a counter-offensive on 
December 18.

  [Excerpt] According to a cabinet decision today, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran will be establishing diplomatic 
relations with the Government of South Africa. 
  According to our correspondent, the decision was made after 
the resolution of the racial discrimination problem in South 
Africa, which was realized as a result of the indefatigable 
struggles by that country's blacks as well as a decision by the 
African Unity Conference and requests by South African Muslims 
and political groups, especially Nelson Mandela, and the Front 
Line states. 
  The cabinet has instructed the Foreign Ministry to pave the 
way for lifting the trade embargo against that country and 
regulating relations between the two countries. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The second round of talks between Turkmen Vice 
President Boris Shikhmuradov and Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati was held in Tehran today. 
  In these talks Mr. Shikhmuradov said his country was ready 
to 
expand ties in all fields. He also said the two countries 
shared many common aspects. He then called for efforts to carry 
out research in the history of relations between the two 
countries. 
  Welcoming the proposal, Mr. Velayati said the Foreign 
Ministry's office of political studies had carried out a great 
deal of research in that field. He then proposed that 
researchers should be sent to Tehran from Turkmenistan to 
further study the topic, a proposal that was accepted by the 
other party.

tons of wheat this year, an increase of 3.8 million tons 
compared to 1988, Deputy Agriculture Minister Jalal Rasulof said 
Monday [3 January].

and provided training courses for six million farmers during the 
first economic development plan, he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Clashes Between Turks and Kurds </F>
in Brussels"] 
  [Text] Dear listeners, hundreds of Turks attacked a group 
of Kurds in Brussels early on 2 January. The Kurds were 
preparing for a demonstration. Reports said that the Turks 
tried to obstruct some 200 Kurds from organizing a demonstration 
in the northern part of the city. A clash broke out and 11 
people were hurt. 
  According to political circles, one of the reasons for the 
recent clashes between the Turks and the pro-Kurdish Workers 
Party [PKK] supporters in Germany is the continuation of the 
pro-PKK activities in that country. Although the German 
Government banned the activities of the PKK and the 
organizations affiliated with it in November 1993, the PKK 
supporters have maintained their activities to a certain degree. 
Most probably, that state of affairs has made the Turkish 
Government uneasy. 
  Considering their political relations with Turkey, Germany 
and several other countries in Europe decided to obstruct the 
PKK's activities toward the end of 1993. However, the measures 
they took were not enough to completely obstruct the PKK. 
Several experts on Turkey are convinced that the supporters of 
the Turkish Government in Europe are trying to help Turkey 
obstruct the PKK activities, regardless of the effective 
measures Ankara has taken against that organization. In view of 
that, the incidents in Brussels can be assessed from that 
viewpoint as well. Needless to say, similar incidents may occur 
in various parts of Europe in the future. 
  The Turkish Government is trying to get PKK's activities 
under control by improving diplomatic relations with Western 
countries, particularly those in which that organization is 
active. Furthermore, it uses its military forces to crush the 
PKK in Turkey. However, intellectual circles are convinced that 
both Turkey and the PKK must adopt a moderate approach and make 
a more serious effort to hold talks to resolve their problem.

  [Text] The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, today 
briefed the Kashmiri leaders about the two-day foreign secretary 
level talks [with India] which ended in Islamabad. He gave them 
the background of the talks and said Pakistan reiterated its 
principled stand that the Kashmir problem must be resolved on 
the basis of UN resolutions which provide for holding plebiscite 
for the realization of the right of self-determination to the 
people of Jammu and Kashmir. The foreign minister regretted 
that the Indian side did not show any flexibility on any aspect 
of the issue. He, however, informed that New Delhi has 
formulated specific proposals on various issues, including 
security of the Line of Control, Siachen, Wullar Barrage, Sir 
Creek and nuclear nonproliferation. The foreign minister told 
the Kashmiri leaders that Pakistan informed the Indian side that 
our response to their specific proposals would be conveyed after 
these proposals have been received and examined on their merit 
and in the light of ground realities in Jammu and Kashmir. The 
president and prime minister of AJK [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] and 
leaders of various political parties of Kashmir were present in 
the briefing. 
  Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali also spoke to PTV correspondent 
Habibullah Farooqi on the outcome of the Pakistan-India Talks: 
  [Begin recording] [Farooqi] The secretary-level talks 
between 
India and Pakistan has produced no result. The Indian foreign 
secretary has termed the UN resolutions on Kashmir as 
irrelevant. What are your comments? 
  [Ali] My comments are that principles do not become 
irrelevant. It is the principle of the UN Resolution 242 which 
is timeless, universal and will always remain dynamic. If the 
UN resolutions according to the Indian foreign secretary are 
irrelevant, then the Simla Agreement is also irrelevant. That is 
our position. 
  One significant thing that happened in the talks was that 
out 
of four sessions of the talks -- the seventh round of talks, two 
and half sessions were used just for discussion on the Kashmir 
problem -- Indian-held Kashmir dispute. This is a significant 
improvement in the sense that at least the Indians are now 
admitting that it is a very serious problem. Regarding our 
position, we have said so very clearly that there cannot be any 
compromise on our position. We will continue to support the 
Kashmiri people diplomatically, politically, and we will keep 
the option of using international forums as and when we think it 
is necessary for the support of the Kashmiri people. But our 
main thrust and emphasis is that they must improve the ground 
situation in Kashmir. They must not indulge in human rights 
violations. They must lift the siege of the Hazratbal shrine 
and they must release the leaders of the All Parties Hurriyat 
Conference. Only if we see some improvement in the ground 
[situation] in Kashmir, then and then only we will agree to the 
future agenda of the talks. [end recording]

in Kashmir which was also supported by the late Indian prime

and torture was initiated by the Indian forces in occupied 
Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Seventh Round and After"] </F>
  [Text] The seventh round of India-Pakistan talks, 
notwithstanding inclusion of Kashmir as a separate agenda, has 
been, to say the least, a non-starter. When he arrived in 
Islamabad to renew the Foreign Secretaries talks exercise, J.N. 
Dixit was all smiles and, for a change, willing to acknowledge 
Kashmir as a disputed territory. He especially flew to Karachi 
to meet the Prime Minister as if he was on a mission of serious 
business. But, what has actually transpired at the negotiations 
table is a reaffirmation of the view that there has been no real 
change in New Delhi's stance on Kashmir, and the offer to have 
talks on Kashmir was basically a ploy to hoodwink world opinion. 
`We told you so', the Opposition would say, and persist in 
accusing the government of `miscalculation' and `mismanagement'. 
And the government will have to reckon with the charge that we 
have let the Indians get off the hook by acquiescing in the 
farce of Kashmir talks, more so because Islamabad had called off 
its initiative at the UN to facilitate the holding of the 
seventh round. Not that the Foreign Office had raised any false 
hopes about a breakthrough, notwithstanding the Prime Minister's 
comment that New Delhi's willingness to discuss Kashmir was a 
`significant development'. It had, on the contrary, made it 
quite clear that it did not expect the Indians to depart from 
their official position to make any major concessions on 
Kashmir. The outcome of the seventh round has thus been what was 
being anticipated in Islamabad. Nevertheless, what calls for a 
convincing explanation is whether or not the hasty decision to 
hold back the UN resolution on human rights violations in IHK 
was worth the `dirty game' the Indians have played on us on the 
pretense of accepting Kashmir as a disputed territory. 
  Where do we go now from the debacle of bilateral approach to 
the Kashmir dispute, is the question that needs to be address by 
the government. We are told by the Foreign Office that it was 
necessary to go through the drill of talks on Kashmir to 
convince our friends abroad that we were willing to negotiate 
with India all the outstanding disputes. But, the Indians, 
being past masters of running international propaganda 
campaigns, are not likely to miss the opportunity to hold 
Pakistan responsible for the deadlock. In any case they have 
been successful in creating confusion and misgivings in the name 
of bilateral talks, in the ranks of freedom fighters. Islamabad 
has clearly brought the message home that no talks at the 
Foreign Secretaries, or any other level, will be scheduled 
unless there is a visible de-escalation of oppression let loose 
by the Indians in the Kashmir Valley. It is admittedly a 
principled stand, and should dispel the Opposition's 
apprehension that there may have been a sell-out on Kashmir. 
Refusal to delink other outstanding problems from the `core 
issue' has demonstrated that the government is not prone to 
buying the so-called `step by step diplomacy' at the cost of 
consigning the Kashmir question to limbo. What has emerged as an 
imperative of ground reality is to renew, with all the resources 
at our command, a concerted bid to internationalise the Kashmir 
question, no matter how annoying it may be to New Delhi.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan needs to spruce up its diplomacy"] </F>
  [Text] The failure of the seventh round of secretary-level 
talks between Pakistan and India has not come as a surprise. It 
was expected that the Indians would reiterate their well-known 
position on Kashmir that the UNCIP's [UN Commission for India 
and Pakistan] resolutions on the issue were no longer relevant. 
Equally predictable was Pakistan's response that any 
efficacious solution to the Kashmir problem must be sought 
within the framework of these resolutions. As both sides stuck 
to their own positions, the talks could not but founder on the 
rock of disagreement on Kashmir. And though the joint statement 
issued at the end of the seventh round mentions the possibility 
of the continuation of talks, no date has been fixed for these. 
This itself is a tacit admission of the growing futility of 
negotiations at the foreign secretary-level. The outcome of the 
talks could, however, have been different had the Indians not 
come to the negotiating table with an agenda which did not leave 
any room for compromise. One indication of this was a statement 
by Dinesh Singh, India's minister for external affairs, on the 
eve of the talks, parroting the old theme of Kashmir being part 
of India. The Indians, in fact, had sealed the fate of the 
seventh round before it had even begun. 
  But the intransigence and obduracy are the hallmarks of 
Indian diplomacy that for long have blighted the prospects of 
peace in the South Asian region. And though it is important to 
keep this factor in view while dealing with Delhi, more 
significant is to devise an effective, long-term counter to this 
Indian attitude. Sadly, so far our foreign office mandarins 
have failed to come up with such a strategy. Their flaccid 
response to India's intense diplomatic moves on Kashmir is a 
testimony to this fact. The Indians, despite committing some of 
the worst crimes against humanity in Kashmir, have been trying 
hard, with some success, to convince the world that they have a 
case on Kashmir. Pakistan, on the other hand, has not been able 
to elicit a positive response from the world community, even 
though its stand on Kashmir is much stronger and more cogent 
than Delhi's. This failure becomes all the more glaring if seen 
in the light of the fact that in today's world no State can 
violate human rights with impunity and not incur international 
odium and censure. But thanks to our diplomatic fecklessness, 
Delhi has been able to perform the are feat of killing Kashmiris 
and feigning innocence in the court of international public 
opinion at the same time. 
  The failure of the seventh round of secretary-level talks 
should be an occasion for our policy makers to draw a long-term 
India policy with clear cut and well-defined goals; one of which 
should be to not let world focus shift from Delhi's oppression 
in Kashmir. Once the goals have been defined, all diplomatic 
efforts should be geared towards achieving these. More 
crucially, the political leadership now has to realise that 
foreign policy is too serious a business to be left to erring 
bureaucrats. Difficult political problems, whether domestic or 
foreign, are best dealt with at the political level.

has ended without any breakthrough over the issue. Pakistan was 
not interested in a gradualist approach favoured by India that 
sought to focus attention on what are issues more amenable to a 
solution, such as Siachen and Waller barrage, etc. The 
contention here could well be that such an approach is an 
unaffordable luxury given the high level of on-going repression 
in the Kashmir valley by Indian forces numbering over half a 
million. A concession in the context of Siachen, for instance, 
could easily be used as a ploy by India to reassure interational 
opinion while seeking to consolidate its hold on Kashmir through 
brutal force. The talks have failed to register progress but 
Pakistan has shown some flexibility by choosing not to rule out 
completely the option of continuing to use the mode of bilateral 
dialogue for finding a solution to the issue. It has, however, 
introduced a note of firmness by linking the posssibility of 
holding another round of bilateral negotiations with India to 
visible and concrete improvement of conditions on the ground, 
such as a reduction in Indian troop strength in the Valley, 
release of the large number of Kashmiri leaders jailed by India, 
etc. It is unfortunate that India has held on to its rigid 
position on Kashmir thereby reducing virtually to nought the 
effect of its earlier more accommodative stance illustrated by 
agreeing to place Kashmir as a separate item on the agenda of 
Pak-India talks. This, in turn, left Pakistan with no option 
but to stick closely to the previously stated position on 
Kashmir and other related issues. 
  As for the criticism emanating from opposition quarters to 
the effect that Pakistan would have been better off not acceding 
to India's request to withdraw the proposed resolution it was to 
present before the UN General Assembly condemning it for gross 
violation of human rights in Kashmir, it appears motivated once 
again by a desire to score points, notwithstanding the sensitive 
nature of the issue. Quite apart from the fact that Pakistan 
has reserved its right to take up the matter at the United 
Nations at any time it deems appropriate, it must be kept in 
mind that the proposed resolution on human rights violations in 
Kashmir being passed in the General Assembly would not, in any 
way, have been binding on India. The idea was to bring the 
issue into focus and make that country a subject of moral 
censure by the international community. It can certainly be 
argued that in following the path that Pakistan has, 
international attention has, indeed, been focused on Kashmir and 
India has been shown up as not being entirely sincere in its 
desire to find a solution to the Kashmir issue. While India has 
thereby been put on the defensive, Pakistan is in a position to 
say to the international community, including the Security 
Council members, that it had bent backwards to accommodate India 
and if the talks have not yielded positive results, it should be 
clear where the fault lies.

  [Text] Heavy fighting resumed in Kabul today after a brief 
lull because of snowfall. Reports say government forces are 
besieging General Dostam's stronghold of Microryan and have 
inflicted heavy casualties. Fighting was concentrated near an 
important Dostam base. Clashes have also been reported from a 
nearby sports stadium. Witnesses said the fighting resumed 
around noon when the fog lifted. In the eastern district of 
Kabul, Golboddin forces allied with Dostam troops are reported 
to be advancing on Qila Zaman about 3 km from the capital Kabul. 
The fighting has left several hundred dead or wounded and 
thousands homeless. The International Committee of the Red Cross 
in Kabul said essential supplies have become scarce.

Afghanistan situation. 
  [Begin Asif Ali recording] We are all actually very very 
disturbed at what is happening there, because precious Muslim 
blood is being shed. That is what becomes even more painful to 
us. I was about to leave for Afghanistan today, but for this 
fighting that has erupted there. I am still prepared to go and 
I have conveyed to Afghan Government and brother Afghan leaders 
that if they want us and even under these conditions, I am 
prepared to go to Afghanistan and make an offer of our good 
offices so that the fighting can end and the bloodshed can end.

in that country now. [sentence as heard] [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali has 
expressed sincere concern over the fighting in Afghanistan, 
saying that it is not a viable option to resolve political 
differences. In a statement issued in Islamabad yesterday, he 
called on all Afghan parties to initiate the process of dialogue 
for national reconciliation. He said the need of the hour is 
peace, understanding, and reconstruction in Afghanistan, so that 
the valiant people of that country could benefit from the fruits 
of the holy war. The foreign minister said Pakistan is of the 
firm view that the military triumph of any one faction over the 
other will be of a transient nature, and it may further 
exacerbate regional, ethnic, and linguistic tension and may 
undermine Afghanistan's unity and regional peace. He said it is 
very important for all regional countries, especially for 
Pakistan, to ensure that civil war is replaced by peace in 
Afghanistan. He said we believe this objective can be achieved 
through the process of negotiations and broad consensus. Sardar 
Asif Ahmad Ali said he is ready to visit Afghanistan if the 
Afghan leadership responds positively.

  [Text] Pakistan is asking all the Afghan parties through 
all available channels to halt fighting and work for the 
restoration of peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan. 
Answering questions by newsmen about the fighting in 
Afghanistan, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said latest reports 
say that the fighting is continuing between the forces of 
General Rashid Dostam and those of Mr. Ahmad Shah Mas'ud. Asked 
to comment on the reports that Pakistan has closed borders to 
stop the supply of food and fuel, the spokesman said Pakistan 
has reviewed the situation in the light of the fighting. He 
said Pakistan does not want to help any party or a new flow of 
refugees from across the border. He, however, said there is no 
question of sealing the border, which is so long and difficult.

  [Text] Islamabad, Jan 4 -- Arab militants and welfare 
workers giving a helping hand to Afghan jehad face no immediate 
threat of extradition to their motherland, an Interior Ministry 
official stated. There is no immediate solution to the problem 
of these foreign nationals and the apparent moves initiated by 
the government from time to time seem a futile exercise. 
Nothing concrete could be achieved in the past nor are there 
any chances of success in future. 
  Most of these Arabs, primarily Egyptians, Tunisians and 
Algerians, are engaged with various non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs) working for the welfare and rehabilitation 
of the Afghan refugees across the NWFP [North West Frontier 
Province]. Their major concentration is in Peshawar. 
  Recently there have been serious allegations against these 
foreigners for their involvement in a number of terrorist 
activities in their mother countries. Pakistan it is learnt, 
has come under quite a lot of pressure from those countries 
following the increased militant activities, including bomb 
explosions and armed attacks on the government officials as well 
as on the foreign visitors by the religious groups. 
  However, the dilemma was that Egyptian, Tunisian and 
Algerian 
nationals cannot be extradited even if their respective 
government formally demand because there is no extradition 
treaty between Pakistan and these countries. A senior Interior 
Ministry source explained that these foreign nationals can only 
be arrested under the Foreigners Act for their illegal entry or 
over-stay in Pakistan. They can be tried in the court of law and 
punished for these offences but can't be extradited to their 
countries forcibly. 
  "The legal process is that we can deport them to the country 
where these people may wish to go and that for only if that 
country is willing to accept them. If no other country is ready 
to welcome them, then they must remain in jails. The process 
also involves the concerned embassy officials and the Foreign 
Office", the Interior Ministry official said. 
  He also said that there were hardly 300 to 400 such foreign 
nationals now working with various Afghan groups and in 
international NGOs [non-governmental organizations] helping the 
rehabilitation of the Afghan refugees. He said that the 
government has no plans to initiate any action against these 
NGOs because they are working on humanitarian basis to help the 
displaced Afghans. These NGOs are also a big [word indistinct] 
factor for the resettlement and rehabilitation of the Afghan 
refugees, he added. 
  The official said that all the foreign nationals engage with 
these NGOs are under close watch. However, as they manoevre 
across the border [word indistinct] freely, it is very difficult 
to keep track of them. "Still our agencies are keeping an eye on 
their activities", he said. 
  The officials dispelled all apprehensions about a major 
action against the NGOs working for the Afghan refuges. It is 
out of question. They are helping the refugees a great deal and 
are of great assistance to the Government as such. However, any 
foreign national found illegally staying in the country will be 
dealt with appropriately", he warned.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The False Accusation Against the ISI"] </F>
  [Text] A U.S. House committee has charged that Pakistan's 
Inter Service Intelligence -- ISI -- is engaged in terrorist 
activities in Indian Punjab, occupied Kashmir, and Uttar 
Pradesh. In a report, it said that the Pakistani ISI is now 
carrying out terrorist operations in India with groups that were 
organized by Pakistan during the Afghan war. 
  The accusation by the U.S. task force against Pakistan is 
very regrettable. As for India, it has always made such 
allegations against Pakistan, and everyone knows the reason 
behind it. However, the U.S. attempt to extend a helping hand 
to India deserves condemnation. We hope that the Pakistani 
Foreign Office will take note of this accusation and lodge a 
protest with the United States. In fact, the Indian agency, 
Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), is involved in terrorism in 
Pakistan and has already killed a number of innocent people. It 
is well known throughout the world that the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency (CIA) is engaged in laying a network of 
conspiracies in other countries. Also, the Israeli secret 
agency called "Mosad" is in collaboration with India's RAW 
engaging in conspiracies against Pakistan. However, the United 
States does not consider the activities of any of these 
organizations objectionable. All its wrath is directed against 
the ISI, which only keeps an eye on foreign agents in Pakistan. 
  We would like to request that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
take note of this accusation. At one time Pakistan used to be 
accused of involvement in disturbances in east Punjab and 
occupied Kashmir only, but attempts are being made now to put 
the blame on Pakistan for the disturbances in Uttar Pradesh, 
too. If we do not take note of this accusation, then the United 
States will start accusing ISI of terrorist acts anywhere in the 
world. We hope that our Foreign Office will not remain silent 
and that it will emphatically reject the blame.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Requirements of National Defense"] </F>
  [Text] The Defense Committee of the federal cabinet at its 
meeting chaired by Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto on 21 
December discussed a long agenda that included the country's 
defense, national security, the latest situation in Kashmir, 
strengthening of the defense capability of the three services, 
effects of suspended U.S. aid, recommendations for the purchase 
of arms from various countries, and financial matters of the 
armed forces. It was the first meeting of the Defense Committee 
after the new government assumed office. At the meeting, the 
prime minister assured the chiefs of armed services that the 
government would fulfill all their requirements at any cost 
because the country's defense is among the government's top 
priorities. The meeting decided that Pakistan would not depend 
on any one country to meet its defense needs; instead the 
country's defense resources would be diversified. 
  A glance at the issues discussed by the cabinet's Defense 
Committee indicates that a comprehensive review of Pakistan's 
defense matters was made at the meeting. Such a review is very 
important and inevitable for a country like Pakistan as its 
defense is always faced with serious danger. Although a ray of 
hope has emerged in the last two months about an improvement of 
relations with the United States, it is, however, premature to 
predict about the final decision of the U.S. Government on 
Pakistan's military and economic assistance. 
  The U.S. Government is reportedly considering some proposals 
to make the Pressler Amendment ineffective. However, it is not 
possible to say anything definitely now about the U.S. Congress' 
final decision on these proposals. In the meantime, Pakistan 
cannot sit idly and do nothing to meet its defense needs, 
especially when it is dealing with an unfriendly neighbor. The 
neighbor appears to be unwilling to adopt a positive and fair 
attitude on the Kashmir issue. On the contrary, it is 
increasing all sorts of repression and violence as the struggle 
by the Kashmiri freedom fighters is intensifying. 
  A few weeks ago India decided to resume talks with Pakistan, 
but it has not been witnessed making any effort for the success 
of these talks. It has intensified its atrocities. Having such 
a neighbor, how can Pakistan remain complacent, even slightly, 
about its defense? In view of the Indian attitude, the foreign 
minister has already expressed his pessimism about the outcome 
of the proposed talks. Armed Forces Chief General Abdul Waheed 
has expressed the view at the cabinet Defense Committee meeting 
that distressed by the situation in Kashmir, India might even 
embark on an adventure on the Kashmir frontier. The army 
chief's opinion is a realistic one. We should never adopt an 
attitude of complacency and indifference regarding India's 
designs. 
  We should endeavor to meet our defense needs from every 
possible source and maintain full preparedness while 
simultaneously expecting an improvement in our relations with 
the United States. The holy Koran also advises Muslims to do 
everything possible for the defense and not to ignore it. Some 
uninformed quarters in Pakistan complain about an increased 
expenditure on defense. They forget that if a nation's defense 
system is not strong, it cannot expect any leniency or softness 
from its enemy. We understand that the Defense Committee has 
adopted a realistic approach by deciding to acquire arms and 
equipment from Europe, China and any other possible source to 
meet the defense requirements of the three services of Pakistan. 
This is a correct decision. 
  Pakistan has repeatedly made the proposal to declare South 
Asia a nuclear-free zone. But the Indian response has always 
been negative. Keeping this negative attitude in view, one can 
easily realize what designs India is nurturing. We hope that 
all the decisions of the Defense Committee will be fully 
implemented and no effort will be spared in making Pakistan's 
defense impregnable. 
  Also, we would like to make it clear that a country's 
defense 
cannot be made impregnable by merely amassing weapons and 
equipment. The country should also have a broad and strong 
industrial base and a self-reliant economy, and it should move 
toward the goal of self-reliance and have a stable and smooth 
political system. While striving to acquire weapons and 
equipment for our armed forces, we should also take effective 
steps for the country's economic and industrial progress. 
  Similarly, we should also make every possible effort to 
ensure the country's political stability and continuity. By the 
grace of God, Pakistan has vast resources. If we utilize these 
resources with prudence and far-sightedness, then there is no 
reason we should not be able to effectively defend our 
motherland and raise the living standard of our people, too. We 
hope that the new elected government will initiate a process of 
reconstruction and reforms in all aspects of our national life.

  [Text] Larkana, Pakistan, Jan 5 (AFP) -- At least one 
person was killed and six others wounded when police fired on 
several hundred supporters of Murtaza Bhutto, brother of Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto, near the family's ancestral home here 
Wednesday, hospital and police sources said. 
  Police claimed demonstrators had opened fire first. 
  The crowds had gathered at the family's Al-Murtaza residence 
in Larkana to take part in ceremonies marking the 66th 
anniversary of the birth of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, former Pakistan 
leader and founder of the ruling Pakistan People's Party, who 
was hanged in 1979. 
  Fearing clashes between rival Bhutto family factions, police 
had cordoned off the premises and set up check points in the 
city to prevent Murtaza's backers from reaching the graveyard 
where his father is buried until after Benazir Bhutto had paid 
her respects. 
  Murtaza, arrested in November on charges of terrorism during 
the 11-year rule of late general Mohammed Zia-ul-Haq, was 
refused parole to visit the grave by a Karachi court. 
  A slogan-chanting crowd suddenly emerged from Al-Murtaza, 
where Benazir Bhutto's estranged mother Nusrat Bhutto was 
staying, and tried to march to the grave site 17 kilometers (10 
miles) away, witnesses said. 
  Another group from the city tried to link up by forcing 
their 
way through a police barricade towards the residence. 
  Senior Superintendent of Police, Bashir Memon, said police 
opened fire only after they were fired on by demonstrators, an 
allegation denied by sources close to Nusrat Bhutto. 
  Her spokesman said the premises came under a "hail of 
bullets" and witnesses said numerous bullet marks could be seen 
in the gate and walls of the house. 
  "The incident was worse than anything experienced in the 
darkest days of Ziaul-Haq," said one of her supporters. 
  Members of her personal staff, whose hands were stained with 
blood, claimed at least two of the wounded were shot inside the 
family compound. 
  "One of the boys injured in the incident was shot in the 
back 
while he was talking to someone at the gate. The car trying to 
take him to hospital was also fired upon by the police," said 
provincial Senator Makhdoom Khaliquzzaman. 
  Police had surrounded the house, allowing no one in or out, 
after reports that Nusrat Bhutto was planning to go to the grave 
in a procession, officials said. 
  "For security reasons we could not allow miscreants to 
accompany Begum Nusrat Bhutto," to the Garhi Khuda Bakhsh 
graveyard, said Memon. 
  During the clashes two police were seized by demonstrators. 
One was still being held, said police chief Memon. 
  Earlier Benazir Bhutto had visited her father's grave amid 
top security. Police ringed the graveyard within a radius of 20 
kilometers (12 miles). She was accompanied by members of the 
Pakistan People's Party's central executive committee, federal 
ministers and MPs. 
  Tight security kept reporters away from the premier who 
appeared composed. She stayed about 30 minutes and left without 
incident. 
  The Bhutto family has become increasingly divided in recent 
months. Benazir has kept her distance from Murtaza since his 
return to Pakistan in November from 16 years of self-exile in 
Syria. Her mother, however, has actively supported him. 
  The two women clashed last month when Benazir ousted her 
mother from the presidency of the ruling people's party. Nusrat 
maintained that her husband before he died had made her the 
party's president for life. 
  It was not clear whether Nusrat would go later to pray at 
her 
husband's gave. 
  "She is ill and running a high temperature, said her 
spokesman.

  [Text] China is not in favor of any form of independence 
for Jammu and Kashmir. The Chinese feelings over the Kashmir 
issue were conveyed to Islamabad prior to the India-Pakistan 
foreign secretary level talks which concluded yesterday. 
Reports say that China had made it clear to the Pakistan prime 
minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, when she visited Beijing last 
month, that China would like a negotiated solution of the 
Kashmir issue and is opposed to any form of independence which 
some separatist groups desire.

<F P=106> [Article by M.K. Dhar </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, 27 Dec. Having suffered several 
diplomatic reverses in the current year, the Government of India 
is planning new initiatives in the new year to neutralise the 
negative impact abroad of many internal political developments 
that have put the country on the defensive. 
  Since the Prime Minister has been discharging the duties of 
the Foreign Minister also on account of Mr. Dinesh Singh's 
indisposition, indications are that a change is in the offing in 
the stewardship of the External Affairs Ministry. Mr. P.V. 
Narasimha Rao now realised that Mr. Dinesh Singh's indisposition 
has affected his mobility at a time when India is under severe 
pressure internationally on the minorities issue, human rights, 
non- proliferation etc. and needs to respond vigorously at all 
international forums. 
  Foreign policy reverses culminated in the cancellation of 
the 
G-15 summit, about whose objectives the External Affairs 
Ministry's top brass was not at all clear. Apart from the 
protocol arrangements, not much thought was given to making the 
gathering purposeful nor were any new approaches to the problems 
of developing countries sought to be defined in an era of new 
economic groupings. 
  The draft declaration approved by the G-15 Foreign Ministers 
makes dismal reading and strikes no new path. The three heads 
of Government of Indonesia, Zimbabwe, and Malaysia saw the 
inadequacy of the document and deferred its consideration. With 
senior officials of the External Affairs Ministry having 
realised how irrelevant the G-15 had become, nothing could be 
done to bring the foreign dignitaries to New Delhi. 
  The traumatic religio-ethnic experience through which the 
country has been passing for over a year, leading to upsurge, 
communal violence, bomb blasts of unprecedented severity, 
escalated terrorist violence in Kashmir leading to retaliatory 
action by the security forces, have had a negative impact on 
external relations. The Government has not been able to derive 
full advantage from the economic reforms because of political 
uncertainty at home, the securities scam which has brought about 
the Finance Minister's resignation, the question mark till 
recently on the Congress Party's performance in the elections to 
the five State Assemblies, escalated extremist violence and 
growth of fissiparous tendencies. 
  Pakistan has taken full advantage of the ethnic situation 
and 
developments in Kashmir and together with other members of the 
Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) forced India into a 
defensive position at all international gatherings, including 
the United Nations. 
  The change of administration in the United States has 
increased pressure as regards human rights, non-proliferation, 
technology transfer, environment and Kashmir, Indo-U.S. 
relations received a severe jolt, though both sides are now 
playing it cool. However, External Affairs Ministry sources 
insist that the Government, while adjusting its foreign policy 
to the realities of the new international situation, has 
succeeded in protecting India's economic, political and 
territorial interests despite adverse circumstances. Even with 
regard to technology transfer, the country's had been 
safeguarded despite embargos. 
  "With no country is it possible to have a totally smooth 
relationship because we do not toe anybody's line. We have a 
structured and calibrated equation with each country. Relations 
with others cannot always be smooth because India is a large and 
complex country." It is also argued that the Ministry did not 
get the political leadership it deserved in such crucial times 
when the whole international scenario has changed and old 
equations are no longer relevant. 
  It is admitted that the Prime Minister's personal 
initiatives 
helped the country to further stabilise relations with China, 
Iran, Israel and South Africa the last two were only recently 
accorded diplomatic recognition. A whole gamut of possibilities 
has opened up with the Central Asian republics, though relations 
with Russia are again passing through an uncertain phase after 
the cancellation of the cryogenic rocket-engine deal. 
  In the new year, priority will be accorded to normalising 
relations with Pakistan and addressing the Kashmir question and 
the exercise will begin with the meeting of the foreign 
secretaries of the two countries. The United States has created 
enough confusion over Kashmir and even Pakistan is now cool to 
suggestions from Washington regarding possible solutions to the 
Kashmir issue. It will be India's endeavour to keep the 
dialogue with Pakistan going on substantive issues while hoping 
that external sponsorship of terrorism in Kashmir will cease. 
  The reverses suffered by the Bharatiya Janata Party in the 
recent Assembly elections have sent out the message that India 
will not abandon its secular principles and that a solution of 
the Babri mosque controversy will be evolved soon. 
  The second priority will be to expand relations with the 
European Union (EU) with which a political dialogue is to be had 
to give additional weightage to the agreement on an upgraded 
relationship with it. Most EU members are to be reassured of 
political stability in India and also the determination to 
pursue market reforms with vigour to attract more investment and 
joint ventures which are still at a very low level. High 
technology flow also needs to be accelerated. 
  Relations with neighbours, except Pakistan, are good and 
will 
be further developed. Attention is being given to resolving the 
Ganga waters issue with Bangladesh and a meeting between Begum 
Khaleda Zia and Mr. Narasimha Rao is expected to materialise 
next year, which may help ease the tension on this score. 
Relations with Tehran which is supportive of India's case on 
Kashmir, are to develop further and a land link established 
between India and the Central Asian republics through Iran for 
free flow of trade and commerce. 
  The pressure on India to sign the NPT [Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty] and subscribe to the MTCR [Missile 
Technology Control Regime] which have somewhat abated may again 
grow. India is expected to stand firm by its commitment to 
universal non-proliferation, as opposed to the discriminatory 
regime, and press for a major review of the NPT in 1995. India 
is also to make it clear that it will not roll back its missile 
development plan in the face of China's missile, including ICBM 
capability and Pakistan's IRBM programme, which is backed by 
China's technical expertise. Concern over China's arms export 
policy is heightened by the fact that weapons flows to Pakistan 
(which is soon to be taken off the Pressler book) will increase 
Islamabad's belligerence. In view of its desire to expand 
economic cooperation with the Asia-Pacific region, India will 
seek closer relations with ASEAN countries or terms of greater 
liberalisation of it economy. Most ASEAN countries appear keen 
to be business with India and strengthen its economy lest China 
becomes an economic giant and in future, constitutes a military 
threat to the region as a whole.

  [Text] India and Uzbekistan have expressed serious concern 
over the rising fundamentalism and cross-border terrorism. 
Addressing the joint press conference in New Delhi today, the 
visiting Uzbekistan president, Mr. Karimov, and the prime 
minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, said these forces disrupt the 
democratic fabric of the nations and there is need to cooperate 
in tackling the vexed problem. 
  Mr. Narasimha Rao said the discussions with the Uzbekistan 
president covered several matters, including bilateral 
cooperation and nonalignment. Both the leaders expressed the 
resolve to step up economic cooperation and trade between the 
two countries. Similar emphasis will also be given to 
strengthen ties in other fields, including culture. 
  Mr. Karimov said that there is great scope for Indian 
enterprises to export consumer goods and set up joint ventures 
in many fields. He said of the 960 joint ventures now in 
operation in his country, only 14 are of Indo-Uzbek cooperation. 
Replying to questions, Mr. Karimov said that the Kashmir issue 
should be resolved through negotiations and without any external 
interference. He was also of the view that the complex Afghan 
problem should be tackled by the United Nations. 
  Earlier, both sides signed six agreement to expand 
cooperation in several areas.

<F P=106> [Sidharth Kanengo commentary] </F>
  [Text] Ties between India and Uzbekistan, which date back 
to ancient years, [break in reception lasting several seconds] 
the visit of the Uzbek president, Mr. Islam A. Karimov. The 
visit, resulting in a series of agreements and memorandum of 
understanding between both the countries, besides high-level 
deliberations, is bound to take their bilateral relations to new 
heights in the new year. The Uzbekistan, the land of the 
builders of India's historic Taj Mahal, offers a very lucrative 
mosaic of opportunities to Indian entrepreneurs, businessmen, 
and industrialists. It is time for Indian businessmen to give 
up inhibitions and invest in this former Soviet republic known 
for gas deposits, coal reserves, non-ferrous metals and gold. 
Now pursuing the path of a free market economy, Uzbekistan is 
witnessing considerable foreign investment flow. The changed 
global scenario definitely demands Indian businessmen to break 
the barrier and tap the available opportunities in the land 
where people also love Indian films and adore Raj Kapoor, the 
doyen of Indian cinema. 
  As Mr. Karimov put it after his arrival in New Delhi on 
Monday, he would not like Indian businessmen to be left behind. 
Besides strengthening cooperation in economic areas, the two 
countries can launch a joint offensive against fundamentalism 
and extremism with India playing a greater role in Central Asian 
region in political fields as well. During his meeting with the 
Indian president, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, the Uzbek president 
said that the disintegration of the Soviet Union had created a 
vacuum in Central Asian region. India has a special 
relationship with the countries of the region when Europeans and 
other countries are to get a foothold. [sentence as heard] The 
agreements and memorandums of understanding now being entered 
between the two countries involve cooperation in economic and 
other areas, including telecommunications, science and 
technology, culture, and transport and transit. The Uzbek 
president earlier held formal talks with the Indian prime 
minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, and discussed bilateral issues 
with several Indian ministers. India had recently extended a 
credit of $10 million for setting up projects with Indian 
know-how and entrepreneurial participation in Uzbekistan. 
Projects worth $7.8 billion [as heard] for Uzbekistan have also 
been approved in addition. Uzbek personnel are being trained in 
India in disciplines such as diplomacy, banking, management and 
mass communication. In the area of joint ventures, the two 
countries are also producing electronic and brass wares. 
India's (Thapar Group) is also to set up a cotton yarn plant in 
Uzbekistan. 
  Close interaction between the top leaders of both the 
countries has been on ever since the Central Asian Republics 
attained independence two years ago. While New Delhi was the 
first city that Uzbek president, Mr. Karimov, visited outside 
the Commonwealth of Independent States in 1991 after his country 
decided to break away from the former USSR, Indian Prime 
Minister Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao reciprocated the gesture in May 
last year when he chose Uzbekistan as his first destination 
within the CIS as prime minister. Only last year, five 
agreements on cooperation in science and technology, tourism, 
avoidance of double taxation and cooperation between the foreign 
offices of the two countries were signed during the visit of the 
Uzbek deputy prime minister, Mr. (T.M. Miryakubov). Mr. 
Karimov, accompanied by a delegation from Uzbekistan, including 
the foreign minister and chairman of board of dealing with trade 
like industry, economic relations, civil aviation and tourism 
met leading Indian industrialists and entrepreneurs to explore 
possible areas of cooperation. This visit is likely to open a 
new era in India-Uzbekistan links with this Central Asian 
country creating conditions for mutually beneficial cooperation 
and encouraging ties with foreign companies, firms and financial 
institutions.

  [Text] The five-week long joint exercise by the special 
forces of Pakistan and the United States begins today. It is to 
be conducted on the high mountain range north of Peshawar in the 
North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. Special forces are 
commandos trained in paratrooping skills and swift decisive 
action behind enemy lines. 
  Defense experts feel that the joint exercises pose a threat 
to Indian positions on Siachen. The experts also say that the 
joint naval and military exercises with littoral states in the 
Indian Ocean have become a means for the perpetuation of U.S. 
military presence in the region.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Text of Amendments Requested by the </F>
Palestinians To Be Included in Israeli Draft Agreement"] 
  [Excerpt] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Palestinian sources 
in Cairo have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the Israeli cabinet 
will today settle the question of resumption of the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Taba in light of the new 
Palestinian amendments faxed to the Israeli Government Friday. 
The amendments, consisting of eight articles, are seen as the 
Palestinian new and final draft agreement. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
has obtained the full details of the eight Palestinian 
proposals. They are: 
  1. The al-Nabi Musa area near Jericho should be under 
Palestinian control. 
  2. Entry to the Gaza-Jericho region should come under the 
jurisdiction of the Palestinian authority along with the 
maintenance of security, with acceptance of electronic 
inspection. 
  3. The al-Maghtis area should be annexed to Jericho in 
the transitional period and the Palestinian flag should be 
hoisted there. 
  4. The Musa al-'Alami project should have Palestinian 
identity and should come under Palestinian sovereignty. 
  5. The Jericho area should be linked to al-Qurunful 
mountain. 
  6. There should be agreement and coordination regarding 
the King 'Abdallah bridge. 
  7. There are no problems regarding the crossing bridges 
with Egypt and there is coordination on that, but where joint 
projects in the Dead Sea area are concerned, the Palestinians 
should have the right of approval, and the same thing would 
later apply with Jordan. 
  8. The international crossings (borders) should come 
under international supervision. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Basim Abu-Sumayyah report from the "Israeli occupied </F>
territories"] 
  [Text] A PLO official has told our radio that the 
resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli talks on arrangements for 
implementing the Declaration of Principles is only a matter of 
days. The official, who did not want his identity known, said 
that tomorrow, or the day after at the most, an announcement 
would be released on the return of the two sides to the 
resumption of negotiations in Taba early next week. He added 
that this round of talks will last four weeks, during which time 
the two sides will discuss a detailed 100-page agreement 
prepared by both sides and including all issues mentioned in the 
Declaration of Principles. 
  The Palestinian official said that Egypt's mediation, as 
well 
as direct contacts succeeded in convincing the two sides of the 
need to return to the negotiations and discuss outstanding 
issues such as border crossings, the area of Jericho, and other 
less difficult problems. 
  The official said that the 13 April deadline for completing 
Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area is 
a firm date for the Palestinians, adding that the Palestinian 
side is adhering to it and will even fight to keep it unchanged.

  [Text] Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' paid a 
surprise visit to Amman last week and delivered a message from 
President Hafiz al-Asad to King Husayn. The visitor brought 
along with him three Syrian surprises to Amman: 
  1. The Syrians asked Jordan to exclude the PLO from 
coordination meetings between Arab negotiators. Despite 
Jordan's anger with the PLO, which has refused to coordinate 
with it and kept delaying a Jordanian-Palestinian economic 
agreement, the Jordanians had some reservations about the Syrian 
request. Amman thinks that isolating the PLO at this time in 
particular could have serious consequences on Jordan, the 
occupied Arab territories, and Palestinian citizens. 
  2. The Syrians also asked for a coordination meeting 
grouping 
the Syrian, Jordanian, and Lebanese foreign ministers and 
negotiators, with Egypt's participation, before 15 January to 
precede al-Asad-Clinton summit. The Syrians believe such a 
meeting will give the summit a chance to discuss substantive 
issues, including agreement on a new round of negotiations that 
could produce tangible progress. 
  3. As for the third Syrian request, it was in response to an 
earlier Jordanian request to resume the meetings of the joint 
higher committee under the two prime ministers of the two 
countries. 
  Asked by AL-WASAT, a Jordanian official declined to answer a 
question about Jordan's reply to Syria's request to exclude the 
PLO from coordination. The official said, however, that 
coordination with Syria is basic and necessary. 
  Before leaving Amman, the Syrian foreign minister said 
coordination with the PLO ended when the secret negotiations 
with Israel in Oslo were uncovered.

  [Text] Israel has presented the PLO with amendments to the 
Cairo draft paper on the Gaza and Jericho withdrawal 
arrangements. Our Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari says a 
new document, bearing the signature of Major General Amnon 
Shahaq, was relayed to Dr. Nabil Sha'th. This document 
introduces changes to four of the clauses from what is defined 
as the accepted format. The changes relate to the fate of 
private Arab-owned land in the Qatif Bloc; the safeguarding of 
roads from the Allenby Bridge terminal to Jericho; the 
arrangements at the border crossing points in Rafah and Jericho, 
as well as to other issues. 
  Well-informed Palestinian and Israeli sources this evening 
confirmed these amendments have been introduced. Israel is 
arguing that if Yasir 'Arafat wants to introduce changes, it too 
can demand changes. 
  A Palestinian source told our correspondent the negotiations 
can be wrapped-up in three weeks -- that is, after the 
Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Amira Hess] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sharp criticism was leveled yesterday at the 
Palestinian representatives to negotiations with Israel by 
participants in a conference of economists in Gaza yesterday for 
not demanding compensation from Israel. 
  The criticism was voiced by Hisham al-Khatib, a member of 
the 
People's Party. Al-Khatib claims the Palestinians should have 
demanded compensation due to the harsh economic restrictions 
imposed by Israel during the occupation years, which according 
to Palestinian economists resulted in an economic setback and 
retardation. Al-Khatib also mentioned the taxes levied from the 
Palestinians over the years, mainly in the Gaza Strip, which 
were not reinvested in the territories. He also referred to the 
taxes paid by Palestinians who have worked in Israel. [passage 
omitted] 
  The discussions, which started in Jerusalem, yesterday 
centered on the challenges to the Gaza Strip economy during the 
interim period. The first session dealt with priorities in 
development initiatives. It was emphasized that investments in 
infrastructure are a condition for encouraging the private 
sector and a market economy. It was agreed that only under a 
local-national authority will it be possible to start 
implementing this goal. 
  During the third session of the conference, which dealt with 
the Palestinian economy's place in the region, the speakers 
agreed it will be impossible to severe economic relations with 
Israel at once. All the speakers agreed that dependency on 
Israel will continue at least in the near future. 
  The most interesting part of the conference was the second 
session, which dealt with the practical issues relating to the 
financing of the planned projects. Dr. Samir 'Abdallah, member 
of the People's Party and the Palestinian delegation to the 
World Bank, defended the need to rely on foreign aid and 
emphasized the fact that the plan formulated by the World Bank 
is only a recommendation and that the Palestinians are entitled 
to propose their own emergency plan. Apparently, however, the 
Palestinians will adopt the World Bank plan with minor 
alterations. [passage omitted] 
  Salah 'Abd-al-Shafi of the "economic development group," a 
center for handing out loans for economic initiatives, claims 
that the Declaration of Principles preserves the status quo in 
economic relations between Gaza and Israel, adding that the 
dependency of Gazan economy on Israel will in fact only deepen. 
  According to him the national mission should be to quickly 
establish the appropriate institutions and train men who will 
know how to make efficient use of the funds. 
  'Abd-al-Shafi criticized the donors and lenders who have 
delayed the transfer of promised funds until the final signing 
of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. He said that the delay is partly 
caused by fear of corrupt use of the funds, but it also points 
to disbelief in the Palestinians' ability to manage their own 
affairs. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A decision regarding the resumption of the Taba 
talks will be made in a few days. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
made this remark today, adding: Both Israel and the PLO have a 
vested interest in the resumption of the talks. The prime 
minister made the remarks during a farewell ceremony for 
outgoing U.S. Ambassador William Brown. Our political 
correspondent Udi Segal reports from the prime minister's bureau: 
  [Begin recording] [Segal] 'Arafat is trying to deviate from 
the agreement of principles, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said. 
We, for our part, are committed to the agreement and our stand 
is clear. We are exchanging comments and messages, the prime 
minister confirmed. The issue of the resumption of the Taba 
talks is being clarified, Rabin said, and will certainly be 
decided on within the next few days. 
  [Rabin] Basically, however, they are still claiming that the 
matters discussed in Cairo are ad referendum [last two words as 
heard], that is -- pending approval. The scope of approval or 
whether there is approval at all is currently being examined. 
If for them it is ad referendum, for us too it is ad referendum. 
  [Segal] The scope of approval was expressed in several 
additional faxed messages received at the Foreign Ministry over 
the past few hours. A senior Foreign Ministry source told us 
that the Palestinians understand our demands, and added: We are 
certain that the whole matter will be settled in a few days. 
  Rabin also sounded optimistic. Speaking at the ceremony 
today, he rejected an attempt to portray the Oslo agreement as a 
dish that went sour: 
  [Rabin] I believe it did not go sour. The dish is fine. It 
is a declaration of principles. The implementation of each 
stage of it requires a separate agreement. We adhere to the 
Declaration of Principles and intend to implement it. I believe 
that the other side wants this as well. It is only natural for 
each side to try getting the most for itself, based on its 
concepts. This is what negotiations are all about. We simply 
need patience. We should not get excited over such or other 
attempts, but proceed onward. 
  [Segal] Rabin answered our questions at the end of a 
farewell ceremony for U.S. Ambassador William Brown, who ends a 
third, non-consecutive term in Israel. Brown spoke about 
Yitzhaq Rabin's courageous leadership, and in his congratulatory 
address he used some Hebrew terms he had learned during his long 
years in Israel. 
  [Brown, in English] The next time we meet I will be an 
betafqid pensyoner [acting pensioner], but I can only ask, as a 
favor, that you extend that warmth, hospitality, frankness, 
candor, and generosity to my illustrious successor Ed Djerejian 
as you did to me. Thank you very, very much. 
  [Segal, translates and continues] Rabin praised Brown warmly 
for his role as Uncle Sam's ambassador in Israel. [end 
recording]

  [Excerpt] Shaykh Ahmad al-Hamud al-Jabir al-Sabah, the 
interior minister, described the talks he held this evening in 
Tunis with Tunisian Foreign Affairs Minister Habib Ben Yahya, 
which dealt with Tunisia's stance toward the Iraqi invasion of 
the State of Kuwait and the respective UN Security Council 
resolutions, as serious and excellent. 
  The interior minister said, in a statement to KUNA, that Ben 
Yahya expressed his country's support for UN resolutions in 
connection with the unjust Iraqi aggression against the State of 
Kuwait, in particular, the two resolutions on the demarcation of 
the border and the resolution calling for the release of Kuwaiti 
prisoners and detainees. 
  Shaykh Ahmad al-Hamud al-Jabir al-Sabah added that his talks 
with the Tunisian foreign minister was a good opportunity to 
inquire about Tunisia's position on the Iraqi invasion and the 
resolutions of international legitimacy. 
  He said that Ben Yahya told him that Tunisia would welcome 
Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir, the first deputy prime minister 
and foreign affairs minister, who is due to visit Tunisia soon.

  [Text] Khartoum, 4 Jan (SUNA) -- Speaker of the 
Transitional National Assembly (TNA) Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah 
has confirmed that Sudan's decision to expel the British 
ambassador is final, because he endeavoured to sabotage the 
relations between Sudan and Britain and he is declared as a 
person of non grata [as received] and will not come back to 
Sudan again. 
  "If the British Government wanted to promote its relations 
with Sudan it must appoint another ambassador whose task is to 
promote the relations between the two countries", Khalifah said. 
He added that we advise and not interfere with others' affairs, 
and confirm that the British Government has to make sure that 
its new ambassador to here must be a believer of all religions 
and qualified to work for the best of the two countries. 
  He said that Sudan is independent in its political, economic 
and social decision and no power in the world can make us change 
our declared policy.

<F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn at a meeting with senior Public </F>
Security, General Intelligence, and Civil Defense officers in 
Amman on 4 January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A few days ago, as you know, I 
met with your brothers in the Armed Forces. I covered several 
important topics that I felt is my duty to explain to the 
brothers, the comrades in arms, and the soldiers of the Arabs. 
[passage omitted] 
  This country is the heart of the greater Arab homeland. This 
country is the homeland of the emigrants [Meccans who emigrated 
to Medina in the early period of Islam] and the followers 
[Medinan followers of Prophet Muhammad who granted him refuge]. 
God willing, this country will remain the example to be 
followed in terms of patience, forbearance, and clear vision for 
all its sons at all stages. We all safeguard national unity 
with our souls, our minds, and our logic, and with an eagerness 
to give a good and unique example to the generations to come of 
the big meeting that unites the one march. I have said on more 
than one occasion, and I mean what I say, that any party which 
seeks to harm national unity in this country -- any individual 
who seeks to do this -- will be my foe until the end. [passage 
omitted] 
  In the past, and over the past few days, I spoke more than 
enough about the atmosphere in which we live and the difficult 
circumstances we experience. I spoke about the peace process to 
which we are committed, about a comprehensive and just peace, 
and the peace that will give the generations to come an 
opportunity to live a free, dignified life in a secure and 
stable atmosphere and that will unleash their potential 
creativity. It is a peace we will not fear if we are armed with 
awareness, determination, and resolve and, as is the case, if we 
are the sons of a rich experience. 
  I also spoke about this decisive stage with respect to the 
need to put emphasis on Arab action and coordination, starting 
with Jordanian-Palestinian coordination. I spoke out of my 
concern for the kinsfolk and the brothers in the occupied 
territories. We have lived and experienced with them difficult 
and harsh circumstances along their path of steadfastness on 
their land and their resolve to cling to it. This stage 
requires the Palestinian command to choose and to clearly define 
the features of its march. We firmly believe that this 
leadership will reflect what is in the hearts and minds of the 
Palestinian people in the occupied territories and elsewhere, 
and that it is rising to the level that will enable it to carry 
out its duty and great role in serving the people on the road to 
the attainment of their aspirations and hopes concerning their 
full rights on their national soil. 
  Naturally, this could happen through the scenario we hope 
for, and in a way where this leadership represents this people 
and continues to serve them in the occupied territories, and in 
a way where this leadership reassures the kinsfolk and brothers 
that it has reached both the stage and level at which it is both 
for and from all Palestinians. 
  Regarding the relationship with us, we are proceeding on a 
path that our fathers and grandfathers followed. We broke bread 
together. I am talking here about this one people and this one 
large family, not only in Jordan but in both Palestine and 
Jordan. We have suffered and continue to suffer together. 
  In this phase, we must reach a situation whose features are 
clear, so we can know what is ours and they can know what is 
theirs, and all of us can know what is incumbent upon us. In my 
opinion, what is being proposed is: Either they seek our 
backing--and we are ready to offer it, just as we have always 
done from the very beginning--or the other alternative, which I 
need not discuss. 
  As for us here in Jordan, when things go well, God willing, 
only then will the choice be presented for those who wish to 
stay with us or to choose another road. One can then make up 
their mind, and their choice will be respected. Until then, 
national unity, democracy, and human rights here should be 
preserved. This will not be for a limited period, but will be 
the beginning of a serious march with an ongoing objective, God 
willing. 
  This country, God willing, is a symbol and a model for the 
brothers in the Arab homeland, in the Islamic world, and 
everywhere. 
  We spoke about Jerusalem. Jerusalem is in the hearts and the 
minds of all of us, and it will continue to be that way. I 
presented my remarks and ideas on the situation and the 
seriousness of this stage, and I voiced my concern that our 
relations with our sacred shrines -- and the shrines in 
Jerusalem in general -- or the responsibilities for them, may be 
affected in one way or another as a result of some development 
or circumstances. In order to avoid a new vacuum, as was the 
case after 1974, concerning Jerusalem and the shrines, we 
explained our view and suggestion. We are continuing our duty 
as best we can toward Jerusalem, which is in our hearts and the 
minds. We will never forget Jerusalem for one moment. 
  We talked about what has been proposed with regard to 
confederation and related issues. As I asked the Palestinian 
leadership to drop this word from its lexicon, I will drop it 
from my lexicon also, as of this meeting, not because I do not 
believe that this people is one people, but because I believe 
that this people, here and there, are the owners of the 
decision. The decision with regard to the form of the future 
relationship is not imposed by any party or any group of people 
-- neither in the Palestinian arena nor here. After the return 
of the land to its people and owners, the decision on this issue 
will be made in the future in an atmosphere of democracy, 
freedom, respect for human rights, and participation in 
decisionmaking. God willing, the meeting [al-liqa'] will take 
place in one way or another on solid and firm ground with 
absolute confidence and accurate knowledge that this Jordan has 
always been for Palestine and that Jordan has never had any 
ambitions toward it. It has always assumed its duties as King 
Husayn I and King 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn assumed their duties. 
We have been performing this duty until today. 
  Then, any formula that comes up will be the accepted and 
agreed upon formula through convergence of opinion -- whether 
the choice was made here or there. Therefore, all these will 
become guarantees to safeguard the march from what it will face 
in the future. 
  Our talk in the past about this issue aimed at enabling our 
brothers to reach what they have reached and to shoulder the 
responsibilities they accepted in order to represent the 
Palestinian Arab people in terms of their rights. We were, we 
are, and we will continue to be committed to our stand with 
regard to the Rabat summit resolution -- regardless of any other 
consideration -- because our kinsfolk and brothers, the owners 
of this right, opted for this road. We supported them and we 
will continue to support with all our potential. 
  We hope that it was a method that helped them reach the 
situation in which they represent themselves in the world. We 
ask God to help them maintain their credibility toward all their 
commitments. I am not speaking in general terms here, I am 
talking in particular about what concerns us here in Jordan. In 
other words, I hope that within a short period of time we will 
reach a clear, common view regarding all important issues. We 
will adhere to our pledges. We have always kept our pledges. 
However, if things remain as they were, particularly since we 
endured a great deal, this will be a risky thing not only with 
regard to Palestine, the cause and rights on Palestinian soil, 
but also with regard to Jordan. 
  I have a great hope that during this period -- I said 
Tuesday, it seems now that it might be Wednesday or 
Thursday...[pauses] Without sincerity and cooperation to serve 
people and the cause, I do not believe we can proceed and wait 
forever. We are very concerned about assuming our duty and 
role. We hope that we will be in a position in which we can 
achieve this. We are aware of the burdens and responsibilities 
shouldered by this Palestinian leadership in this delicate 
stage. However, these are responsibilities that it opted to 
shoulder. With God's help, it will reach the level in which we 
can support it in all details and matters that must be tackled 
by all of us. 
  We hope that it is seen in the world as a responsible party 
that represents all those it is shouldering the responsibility 
of representing. We hope that it will be flanked with the great 
human resources that are available in the arena and will be 
credible so that it will be able to move ahead, God willing, and 
so that all these initial developments will be the beginning of 
reaching the aspired objectives, with God's help. 
  I spoke about coordination with our brothers, and this is 
something that is taking place with our brothers in Syria, 
Lebanon, and Egypt. Again, if the Arab trend has been toward a 
comprehensive solution, then we have kept our commitment to work 
for a comprehensive solution. 
  If some thought that this country, for one reason or 
another, 
and due to the burden and responsibilities it is bearing, might 
choose a different path, such expectations have not been 
realized, praise be to God. 
  A sisterly Arab country had concluded a peace treaty with 
Israel. We all agreed on the same objective when we agreed to go 
to Madrid. The Palestinian brothers--of whom we are part, whom 
we supported, and for whom we shouldered the responsibility 
until 1974--chose to shoulder the responsibility. This decision 
received an all-out Arab blessing. We were committed to a 
similar position toward them, and we will continue to be so. 
They have chosen to go with us, even formally in a certain 
stage when the umbrella was there, before we threw it in the 
wastebasket of history, and before they directly shouldered 
their responsibilities. 
  Now, we are continuing our search and efforts, and everyone 
knows that since 1974 we have followed a clear path. We have 
been committed to a firm position. Neither before 1974, nor 
since the adoption of the Security Council Resolution 242 -- 
which the PLO accepted alongside Resolution 338 as the basis of 
what is going on now, nor after the disengagement of 
administrative and legal links with the West Bank, did we ever 
bargain for one moment on a grain of the Palestinian soil or any 
of the Palestinian rights on Palestinian soil. Our position has 
been the same since 1974, and we have been supporting the PLO 
position from 1974 until now. 
  A greeting to all the sons of the homeland, under all 
circumstances, at this critical stage. A greeting of pride and 
appreciation. At the same time, we take pride in those who 
shouldered their serious and sensitive responsibilities under 
these circumstance by representing Jordan in the peace talks 
from the beginning when a national decision was made to go to 
Madrid. In every circumstance they were brave men who did not 
fear meeting with others, working for the sake of our interests, 
and preserving the right to live for the people and the whole 
nation. 
  We hope that matters will move toward a comprehensive 
solution with the participation of all sides, stage after stage, 
and in light of the fact that we all have proceeded from the 
same point. I have previously mentioned, and I reiterate it 
now, that despite all pressures, we in this country are not 
prepared to sign a peace treaty unless we deal with all issues 
and matters in a satisfactory and balanced way acceptable to us 
and to the other party. When all these issues are dealt with, 
peace will follow in the final analysis or be the beginning for 
a new stage in which every one lives in security and stability 
and in which doors are opened wide, God willing, to progress and 
development for people to live in circumstances from which we 
were deprived from the beginning. We concentrate on land, 
water, human rights, and all the topics included in the agenda 
that we have endorsed in support of progress on the 
Palestinian-Israeli track. 
  As you all know, we stayed behind, waiting for something. A 
surprise followed, and we decided to approve the agenda 
pertaining to the issues between Jordan and Israel. We also 
described the Palestinian step as courageous, and we hoped the 
leadership would rise to the required level. We hope that the 
Palestinian arena will be one in which all people meet with 
clear vision and unity in this critical situation. At the end 
of this meeting, I repeat my thanks to and appreciation for all 
the brothers, and I hope you will convey my heartfelt greetings 
to all the brothers who share your responsibilities in your 
various fields, as well as our love for and pride in you. We 
are part of this great march, which will achieve, with God's 
help, all its goals. God bless you, and God's peace be upon 
you. [applause]

  [Text] Cairo, 4 Jan (MENA)--Afghan Ambassador in Cairo 
Mohammad Sadeq Saljuqi has stated that yesterday he received a 
phone message from Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani to 
convey to President Husni Mubarak on the situation in 
Afghanistan, which began to return to normal today. At a news 
conference at the Afghan Embassy in Cairo at noon today, he said 
the message explains the scale of the coup scheme hatched by the 
coalition of Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, communist 
leader General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, and former Soviet agent 
Mahmud Barialay to seize power. 
  Ambassador Saljuqi said that on 1 January, Hekmatyar fired 
thousands of missiles at Kabul to support and protect the 
communists and Dostam's militiamen, causing heavy losses in 
Kabul. He said that according to reports from Kabul today, the 
state forces are completely in control and have forced the 
communist coalition forces to retreat from the areas they 
controlled before the offensive. He stressed that Kabul Airport 
has been purged of communist elements after they suffered heavy 
losses--200 dead, 300 captured, and 12 tanks seized. He 
asserted that the Mazar-e Sharif airport has been put under 
control. The northern areas of the Qeysar, (Sherghan), and 
Mazar-e Sharif are being purged. He pointed out that President 
Rabbani has declared jihad against the communists and their 
allies. The Afghan ambassador categorically denied that 
President Rabbani had fled abroad and stressed that he did not 
leave Kabul. Ambassador Saljuqi said the perpetrators of the 
coup have split and fled and specific areas are being purged. 
  On a call by writers and thinkers for the Islamic Conference 
Organization to intercede to establish stability in Afghanistan, 
Saljuqi said there is a dispute between a legitimate government 
and elements opposed to the government, so the situation does 
not require intercession by any friendly party. He noted that 
Pakistan and Iran expressed readiness to help keep the elements 
in check. He said Afghanistan accuses no party regarding the 
funding of these elements, but he noted the country's 
deteriorating economy. He said Afghanistan is suffering 
starvation and is in dire need of food aid in particular. He 
noted that the Afghan Government appealed to the international 
community and friendly countries to provide food aid.

  [Text] New Delhi today reiterated its commitment to 
continue bilateral discussions with Pakistan to resolve all 
outstanding issues. The foreign secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, said 
that India is not resigned to the end of bilateral exercise and 
it is committed to peace process without any precondition. 
Talking to newsmen in New Delhi this evening, he said that the 
long discussions he had with the Pakistan prime minister, Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto, shows that she wants to give a signal to keep 
the momentum of bilateral interaction at all necessary levels. 
  Admitting that the talks have ended in a stalemate, Mr. 
Dixit 
said the ball is, however, in the Pakistan court as they have 
not agreed to a timeframe for the next round of discussion. Mr. 
Dixit said while Pakistan insisted during the talks that Kashmir 
should be the core issue to improve bilateral relations, India 
asserted that the wide ranging bilateral issue should not hinge 
on one problem. 
  The foreign secretary disclosed that he had offered specific 
proposals to improve bilateral ties and his Pakistan counterpart 
Mr. Shaharyar Khan had agreed to consider them. 
  Mr. Dixit rejected reports in Pakistan press that India has 
agreed to resume bilateral talks on Kashmir because of pressure 
from abroad and the problem has become unmanageable. He said 
New Delhi has the capability to tackle the problem and there is 
no question of succumbing to pressures in areas where the 
nation's fundamental interests are involved.

<F P=106> [Report by Sammy Ketz] </F>
  [Excerpt] Jerusalem, Jan 5 (AFP)--The PLO and Israel have 
struck a compromise to resume self-rule talks next week in the 
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba after a week's freeze, an 
Israeli negotiator said Wednesday [5 January]. 
  "The two sides are expected at the end of the week to 
announce the resumption of the Taba negotiations on the basis of 
the document drawn up last Wednesday in Cairo," he said. 
  "But the Palestinians will be able to rediscuss the points 
which they judge contentious," the negotiator told AFP, asking 
not to be named. 
  The compromise allows both sides to argue that they stood 
their ground on a draft document which Israel leaked after 
negotiations last week in the Egyptian capital. 
  Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation have fought 
a battle of words over their different interpretations of the 
last round of negotiations, but have been holding intensive 
consultations in private. 
  "The PLO offered us a dozen compromise formulas before 
giving 
one that satisfied us," the negotiator said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The official announcement on the resumption of 
Israeli-PLO talks has just been issued in Jerusalem and Tunis. 
The statement was made simultaneously by Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres, head of the Israeli Liaison Committee, and 
Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas], head of the Palestinian delegation. 
  Following is the text of the announcement: 
  The two sides reaffirm their total commitment to the letter 
and spirit of the Declaration of Principles [DOP]. They believe 
that the talks in Norway, Versailles, and Cairo will help to 
achieve an agreement that will quickly turn the DOP into a new 
reality on the ground. Once an agreement is reached, it will 
be impossible to change it unilaterally. The two sides have 
agreed to resume the Taba negotiations on the basis of the DOP 
and the understandings reached in Cairo. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0730 GMT on 6 January adds 
that "the talks will resume on 10 January. Sources in Jerusalem 
expressed their satisfaction with the compromise formulated by 
Peres and Nabil Sha'th"]

<F P=106> [Report by Tova Tzimuqi] </F>
  [Text] Israel wants to retain legal and judicial 
responsibility for the handling of serious crimes perpetrated by 
Palestinians in the autonomous areas in Gaza and Jericho, even 
after the agreement of principles is implemented. 
  This proposal is contained in a draft document dealing with 
the implementation of the legal aspects of the autonomy 
agreement submitted to the PLO for perusal . 
  According to the proposal, crimes committed by Palestinians 
against Israelis and resulting in death or serious injury, as 
well as rape and kidnapping, would be immediately transferred 
from the Palestinian police to the Israeli law enforcement 
authorities. 
  The document relayed to the PLO was drafted by a team of 
police officers and legal experts in the Foreign, Defense, and 
Justice Ministries and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The 
document stipulates that Israelis in the autonomous areas would 
enjoy quasi-diplomatic status. They would enjoy immunity from 
the Palestinian police and could be arrested, interrogated, and 
tried only by Israeli elements. 
  Israel proposes full reciprocity in law enforcement only 
with 
regard to minor crimes committed by Palestinians or Israelis 
within the autonomous areas. Minor crimes committed by 
Palestinians against Israelis would be handled by the 
Palestinian law enforcement authorities. They would conduct the 
investigation, arrest, trial, and punishment and would then 
report the measures taken to the Israeli law authorities. If 
they fail to do so, Israel would be entitled to deal with these 
crimes as it sees fit. 
  The document contains a detailed proposal on law enforcement 
and policing in the autonomous areas. Joint patrols by Israel 
Police and the Palestinian police force would drive in two cars 
on all the roads where there is intensive Israeli traffic (such 
as the Erez-Rafah road). There would be two kinds of patrols: 
one kind would drive back and forth, while the other would be 
stationary. The latter would be deployed at major junctions, 
and would be summoned as warranted by reports about incidents. 
  The Israeli and Palestinian police vehicles would be linked 
by radio to a joint situation room. Three situation rooms would 
be established: one in Jericho and two in the Gaza Strip, one 
in the north and another in the south. The situation rooms 
would be overseen by a liaison committee. 
  Joint patrols accompanied by patrols of the Israeli security 
forces would drive on lateral roads linking the Gaza Strip and 
Israel. 
  The draft agreement submitted to the PLO further states that 
the implementation of the autonomy in Gaza and Jericho would not 
annul existing entitlements or private deals between Israelis 
and Palestinians. The law of continuity would apply to 
obligations, rights, and damage suits. It should be pointed out 
that upon mutual consent any security and legal arrangements to 
be decided would be subject to revision in the following five 
years.

  [Excerpts] Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam met at noon 
today with the heads and members of the Arab press agencies' 
delegations participating in the 21st conference of the General 
Assembly of Arab News Agencies Union. [passage omitted] 
  Khaddam addressed the heads and members of the Arab News 
Agencies delegations participating in this conference. He said: 
It gives me pleasure to meet with some of the elite who work in 
the Arab information field. I wish you an enjoyable stay in 
Syria and I wish your conference success in attaining the 
objectives for which it is meeting. [passage omitted] 
  Khaddam said: You know that the Arab nation faces serious 
challenges against its present and past, not to mention its 
future. These challenges revolve around the control of the land 
and the will. The foremost of these challenges is the Zionist 
challenge and the foreign designs against our countries. We 
face these challenges under complicated international 
circumstances as the world now lacks balance, objectivity, and 
law, not to mention the state of division and fragmentation the 
Arabs are suffering, and the stagnant Arab unity movement and 
the activities it should have inspired that would have been 
employed in tackling these challenges. If the Zionist challenge 
now is the same as it was years ago, it remains the most serious 
challenge in the future because the Zionist movement has an 
ideology and a strategy based on the establishment of a major 
power in this region. The political borders of this state, as 
we know, will not be within the boundaries of its present 
aggression. Its economic borders will target Arab resources 
while its strategic borders will extend to Iran, Pakistan, and 
others. 
  The domestic challenge, as I have mentioned, is the Arab 
state of affairs in itself. All joint pan-Arab values have 
vanished, replaced by concepts that have nothing to do with 
pan-Arab interests. Arab relations became unbalanced and the 
use of force or the threat of using it within the framework of 
these relations has become a manifestation that has contributed 
to the uncomfortable state of affairs we are now experiencing. 
  Some of those who have been overpowered by their countries' 
interests believe that the conflicts they wage serve their 
people. They do not realize that these conflicts have taken 
place at the expense of their people and not in their interest, 
and that these conflicts have taken place in the service of 
foreign powers and not in their service. Thus, we found 
pan-Arab unity threatened and we experienced a harsh campaign 
waged from outside and assisted from within the Arab homeland 
threatening the national unity of several Arab countries. 
[passage omitted] 
  The vice president said: If we review the current 
circumstances, we realize the role the foreign media has played 
in the service of Israel. Before the conclusion of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, there was no one in the West, or among 
those on its bandwagon, ready to offer any assistance or to 
seriously work to stop the Israeli pressure against the 
Palestinian intifadah. Suddenly, after its conclusion, we all 
saw the media theatrics with which some of the Palestinian 
leaders have been welcomed in some countries that used to ban 
their entrance. The media portrayed the incident as if was a 
historical transformation, and encouraged some to have 
illusions. This, undoubtedly, has greatly served Israel. 
[passage omitted] 
  The vice president said: We always talk about the Arab 
situation, which pains and embitters every Arab citizen. There 
is no doubt that unless matters are restored to their natural 
situation and unless everybody understands that his fate is 
linked with that of the nation, the Arab situation will remain 
complicated and painful for every one. Due to our status as a 
confrontation state and to our historical circumstances, we in 
Syria fully understand that the restoration of the Arab spirit 
to Arab relations has become necessary and fateful. 
  There is no doubt that searching for solutions and creating 
suitable joint Arab action to serve the nation's interests and 
its progress should be the responsibility of every one at this 
current stage. 
  When waging the battle of peace, which is like a battle in a 
real war, the fighter will be in a stronger position if his 
nation is unified and enjoys solidarity. Similarly, the worker 
in a time of peace will enjoy a stronger position in defending 
the nation's rights if that nation is unified and enjoys 
solidarity. 
  We have been calling for a just and comprehensive peace 
since 
the beginning of the seventies, and that the issue of peace has 
been a principal part of our strategy. We mean by peace a peace 
that will enable us to regain all our territories and the 
Palestinian Arab people's national rights. 
  Then came the U.S. initiative, which we accepted after 
lengthy discussions that led to basic amendments to that 
initiative, foremost of which are the need for a comprehensive 
solution on all fronts and insistence on implementing UN 
resolutions. We went to Madrid, eager to see coordinated Arab 
action among the Arab parties involved in the process and also 
to see other parties that are not directly involved in constant 
touch because the conflict has a pan-Arab, rather than, regional 
nature. 
  All the Arab summits' resolutions have asserted that all 
solutions should be Arab ones. In light of this concept, we 
worked and went to the Washington talks, and many attempts were 
made to reach a solution with Syria on the occupied Syrian 
territories. We rejected these because we believed in the 
pan-Arabism of the conflict, and consequently, in the need for a 
comprehensive solution, because unilateral solutions cannot 
produce peace and stability in the region. [passage omitted] 
  Then contacts were held, and it was agreed to hold a meeting 
between President al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
Geneva this month. The vice president added: Our position will 
remain clear. Peace should lead to the implementation of the 
Security Council's resolutions and to a total withdrawal from 
the occupied territories. We hope that the meeting will produce 
positive results. He said: We tried to maintain a unified Arab 
effort during the peace process, but regrettably, multilateral 
meetings were held. We believe that such meetings should not 
discuss issues pertaining to peace before discussing the issue 
of peace and withdrawal. 
  He said: You notice brothers that after the signing of the 
agreement between the PLO and the Israelis, the Israelis tried 
to make it look as if peace had been realized in the region. 
They started to demand the lifting of the Arab boycott, and the 
establishment of relations between Israel and the Arab states. 
Regrettably, some Western circles adopted this position without 
taking into consideration that the reason for the Arab boycott 
was Israel's aggression against the Arabs, its occupation of 
their lands, and the displacement of millions of Palestinians. 
The reasons for the boycott still stand. Undoubtedly, the 
position on this issue has been good, and all attempts to draw 
the Arab countries into canceling the boycott failed. [passage 
omitted] 
  Khaddam addressed the conference and said: I sincerely say 
to you that had we been feeling weak, we would not have gone to 
the peace negotiations. It is true that there is a vast 
military imbalance, but there is also a great imbalance in other 
issues that are in the Arab favor and are no less important than 
military power. Had we been feeling weak, we would not have gone 
to Madrid or Washington because negotiations with the weak or 
the one who is viewed as weak are sure to be at his expense and 
at the expense of his land. 
  He said: We feel that our capabilities and those of the 
Arabs are not small. These capabilities enable us to feel 
strong. He pointed out that the time when the Israelis used to 
carry out operations that made the people feel defeat is no 
longer. [passage omitted] 
  He emphasized: There will never be a peace that is not 
honorable and that does not guarantee our full rights. The 
peace we want is the one with which we and our future 
generations will be proud, no matter how bad or complicated the 
circumstances become. For us, an inch of land represents the 
dignity, honor, and future of the country. Nevertheless, had 
the Arab situation been normal, our capabilities to realize 
gains would have been much better, and this would have been in 
the interest of all parties. 
  Khaddam then answered questions of the conference members.

  [Text] Tunis, Jan 5 (AFP)--The PLO executive committee has 
accepted some of the demands put forward by a delegation of 
leading Palestinians towards making the organisation more 
democratic, Palestinian sources here said Wednesday [5 January]. 
  Delegation head Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi has been given full 
powers to organize a broad dialogue grouping all factions with 
the aim of uniting the Palestinians, the sources said. 
  'Abd-al-Shafi, who led bilateral negotiations with Israel 
before the signing in September of an autonomy accord by the PLO 
and the Jewish state, has headed the seven-member delegation 
holding talks with PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and close associates 
here since Sunday. 
  The delegation called for the adoption of nine points 
included in a memorandum signed by 120 prominent Palestinian 
personalities from the occupied territories and the diaspora 
last month. 
  The memorandum calls for more democracy in running PLO 
affairs and demands a change in the conduct of negotiations with 
Israel over limited autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank 
town of Jericho. 
  'Arafat, who has been accused of being autocratic, is yet to 
comment on the proposals. 
  The Palestinian source said two of the demands presented to 
'Arafat and the executive committee have been rejected, while 
all the others were likely to be adopted by the organisation. 
  These two were the proposal to create a high consultative 
committee of experts with a parallel status to that of the 
executive committee and the call for forming a supreme authority 
to guide, direct and follow up the autonomy negotiations with 
Israel. 
  Nabil 'Amr, an adviser of the PLO leader, said Tuesday he 
expected some opposition to the proposal calling for the 
creation of a consultative standing committee made up of experts 
that would have similar authority to that of the executive 
committee. 
  The question is not in the abundance of new structures, a 
participant in the executive committee meetings told AFP 
Wednesday. 
  "Our aim is to democratise and to make those already 
existing 
more efficient and productive," he said. 
  According to executive committee member 'Ali Ishaq, the body 
chaired by 'Arafat has approved the reactivation of the PLO 
Council of Planning which has been crippled for some time by a 
financial crisis hitting the organisation since the end of the 
1991 Gulf War. 
  Officials close to the PLO leader doubt that any result 
would 
come out from the democracy debate as they consider the move 
itself a struggle for power only, rather than a call for real 
sharing in the decision-making process.

sum up the talks on PLO internal reforms. The figures have 
expressed their satisfaction with the results of the meetings 
that have taken place so far. They said that the PLO leadership 
has agreed, in principle, to set up a special consultative body 
to support the Executive Committee. A statement on the results 
of these talks is expected to be issued tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Report by Roni Shaqed] </F>
  [Text] The suspension of the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads' 
murderous attacks, designed to enable the deportees to return 
home without delay, ended on Wednesday [22 December] morning. 
Me'ir Mendelovich, 32, a father of eight children, and Eliyahu 
Levin, 25, both from Bene Beraq, were murdered while driving 
through Baytuniya, a town near Ramallah. They were giving the 
deportees a unique welcoming reception, saturated with Jewish 
blood. 
  The 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam murder squads -- the military arm 
of Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] -- left a leaflet on the 
scene of the murder. "This was in revenge for the killing of 
'Imad 'Aqil, the Hamas commander of Gaza, and for the killing of 
three Tarqumiyah residents by Jews." Brigadier General Sha'ul 
Mufaz, the military commander of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, 
required no explanations. "I see no particular daring in the 
murders. They want to harm Jews. They lie in wait in places 
where they expect to find easy prey, they spot Jews, and they 
shoot." 
  Twenty four of the deportees, who over the past year turned 
out to be members of the Hamas military apparatus, preferred to 
remain in Lebanon. They will presumably find their niches 
either in Hizballah operations or in the military apparatuses of 
Hamas. Defense figures believe that many of those who did return 
had been instructed and trained at the terrorist academy of 
Hizballah. 
  "Hamas remains the same Hamas. We return stronger, with 
greater support and sympathy among the residents of the 
territories." This observation was made by Dr. 'Aziz Duwayk, 
dean of the geography studies at the Hebron University, one of 
the 197 deportees who were allowed to return to the territories 
last week. Of these, 65 remained in prison -- some for 
interrogation about ties with Hizballah, others for 
Hamas-related activities prior to the deportation. About 10 
have received administrative detention orders. 
  Fatah personnel members walked around with long faces this 
week. They had hoped that Israel would release a few hundred 
security prisoners, in order to offset the joy of their 
opposition and to try to stop the erosion of the support for the 
peace process. (A survey by the Palestinian Center for Research 
in Nabulus, which was published this week, showed that only 41 
percent of the territories residents support the peace 
agreement, versus 65 percent in September; 38 percent are 
opposed to the agreement, versus 28 percent in September.) 
Hamas and their opposition partners are now seeking to take 
advantage of the deportees' return to create a new momentum for 
oppositionist activities. 
  The 17 December 1992 deportation was carried out at the peak 
of the violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah, but the 
attitude of the deportees who returned this week was 
conciliatory toward Fatah, despite the new political reality 
which followed the Rabin-'Arafat handshake. 
  "We are opposed to this agreement, but we will express our 
objection in democratic ways only," Dr. Duwayk stresses. "We 
will make sure that not a single drop of Palestinian blood is 
spilled in this struggle. Fraternal infighting goes against our 
faith, Islam." Referring to press headlines about an 
elimination list with names of Fatah members, which was 
allegedly brought back by the deportees, Dr. Duwayk says: 
"Nonsense. This is not our way." 
  But violence against Israel will not cease, he adds. Its 
causes have not changed. "Rabin wants to give us autonomy. We 
want sovereignty. Therefore, I say thank you to autonomy. 
Anyway, Rabin wants 'Arafat to be a dictator, because that will 
ease the way to his goals. A majority of our nation are against 
the agreement. Therefore, you should remember that Rabin signed 
an agreement with only one organization out of all the 
Palestinian organizations. Were I to record history, I would say 
Israel signed an agreement with one man only -- with 'Arafat." 
  Dr. 'Aziz Duwayk, 45, has seven children. The oldest, 
Muhammad, is 15, and the youngest, a four-month-old baby girl, 
was born while he was in exile. He named her "Di'ah" -- prayer. 
In the Marj al-Zuhur camp, Duwayk was one of the deportee 
spokesmen. 
  It was an extraordinary camp: There were 88 university 
students, 30 professors and tutors from territories 
universities, 11 doctors, 10 engineers, 18 senior religious 
clerics, 10 liberal arts university graduates. Dr. Salamah, 
acting president of the Gaza University, was also there. A 
distinguished human composition, far beyond the average level of 
the Palestinian street. It is, more or less, the human 
composition of Hamas. 
  The camp consisted of several dozen tents. Some were 
populated by five or six men, while others housed one man only. 
In the center of the camp, a large tent -- 10 by 20 meters -- 
was set up to serve as a mosque. Its floor was covered with 
mats, and a mahrab indicating the direction of prayer, as well 
as a small podium for the preacher -- a different one every week 
-- were built. "Thank God, we had quite enough preachers," 
Duwayk says, laughing heartily. 
  Education is one of the most important Hamas values, and 
most 
of the deportees' days at Marj al-Zuhur were therefore spent in 
study. A few days after the deportation, two large tents were 
set up for that purpose. A large sign over the entrance to one 
of them proclaimed: "The ink in the pen is stronger than the 
bullet in the gun." 
  They had teachers for every subject, plenty of time, and few 
students in every classroom. It was a university in every 
respect, and the studies conducted there have gained the 
recognition of the universities in the territories. Ibrahim 
Abu-Salim from Ramallah, for instance, completed his Phd 
dissertation in Marj al-Zuhur. The research, which dealt with 
the philosophical trends of Islam, was sent to the Sudanese 'Umm 
Durman University for approval and earned Abu-Salim a Phd. 
  They studied biology, geography, education, and Islam at the 
Marj al-Zuhur university. The students had a large library at 
their disposal, after over 2,000 books were donated by Islamic 
universities. The library was arranged in a tent with 
carpet-covered flaps and with a large photograph of 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam in the center. 
  Dr. Duwayk taught geography. "I specifically taught the 
geography of southern Lebanon, so that the deportees would know 
on which part of the map they were situated. Later I talked 
about the geographical conditions of the place. I also taught 
them topographical orientation and air currents, to help them 
find the direction of the prayer." 
  Various other lessons were arranged for nonacademic 
deportees. Language courses were the most popular. They studied 
French, English, Italian, Russian, Spanish, and some even took 
an extended, three-level Hebrew course for beginners, mid-level, 
and advanced students. 
  Special professional courses were also launched, teaching 
electricity, first aid, and even bee breeding. A course taken 
by all the deportees taught Koran reading and comprehension. 
Some 350 course and professional training students received 
graduation diplomas during the one-year deportation at Marj 
al-Zuhur. 
  A nine-member supreme committee, chosen in democratic 
elections by all the deportees, ran the camp's everyday life. 
In the last weeks, the deportees elected Mahmud Hasan Sham'a 
from Gaza as camp committee chairman -- a honorary appointment 
given to the oldest deportee. The camp committee had two tents 
-- one for an office and another for gatherings and conferences. 
  Eleven deported doctors received fellow deportees in two 
tents -- a clinic and a hospital. A few weeks after the 
deportation, local Lebanese villagers also began frequenting the 
clinic. Medicines were received by special order through the 
Red Cross. 
  There was no food shortages. Most was bought in neighboring 
Lebanese villages, and in addition, the deportees received 
donations from relief and welfare organizations and Palestinian 
groups. "Even Fatah people supplied us with food, and there are 
many Fatah factions in Lebanon. We received donations from 
everyone, even from 'Arafat's people," Duwayk says. "Hizballah 
gave us food, too. We were not fussy about the source of 
assistance." 
  [Shaqed] What did you eat? 
  [Duwayk] Rice, macaroni, meat, chicken, vegetables. All 
kinds of cooked food. Occasionally fruit too. 
  [Shaqed] Who did the cooking? 
  [Duwayk] Each in his turn cooked and did chores. I, for 
instance, cooked majadara, soups, meat, and rice. 
  The deportees returned with large suitcases filled with 
clothing items -- mainly sports clothes. In the first days of 
the deportation, they received every conceivable kind of 
clothing. Summer clothes were sent with the advent of spring. 
The Red Cross supplied blankets. 
  Their daily activities were arranged around prayer hours. 
Even on snowy days, they woke up at 0330 for early morning 
prayers. "When we washed to purify our bodies for prayer, water 
would freeze on our hands," Duwayk reveals. "But, thank God, we 
did it out of love. After the morning prayer, we would gather 
for special worship, including personal prayers. We prayed to 
God, calling out loud: God, take us back to our homes. God, 
please soften Rabin's heart of stone." 
  After prayers, about one hour was devoted to gymnastics and 
sports -- judo, karate, yoga, jogging, and ball games. The 
Lebanese donated a few table tennis sets, and a volleyball court 
was arranged in the camp. 
  After breakfast, time was set aside was cleaning and 
tidying. 
University and other studies began at 0800. They went on, with 
brief recesses, till the midday prayer, which was followed by a 
meal. Studies were then resumed till 1600, "after which there 
was more sports, personal things to attend to, dinner, and then 
everyone would sit around the TV set and watch the Israeli 
television newsreel. We saw footage on Hebron and Gaza on the 
news every day, and the little screen helped us to remain in 
touch with home. After that, there were gatherings, meetings, 
conversations, and a night prayer." 
  Television was not their only link with the world. There 
were also many radio sets. In addition, they had three cellular 
phones and a fax machine. "Each morning, we received faxed news 
from news agencies, as well as a translation of YEDI'OT 
AHARONOT," Duwayk says. 
  One cellular telephone was used exclusively by the 
spokesman, 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Rantisi, against whom the authorities have 
just issued a six-month administrative detention order. The 
dialing was done through a U.S. switchboard. The two other 
cellular phones were reserved for conversations with relatives. 
The phones belonged to local villagers, who charged $1.5 per 
minute. 
  A news conference was held every afternoon. Telephone 
interviews were carried out with reporters throughout the world. 
  "We had parties on religious holidays. Deportees from the 
Hebron area would prepare knafa (a baked sweet cheese dish), and 
we would buy sweet foods, particularly pastries, such as 
baklava. We had a debka [oriental dance] troupe made up of the 
youngest deportees, which danced at parties. We also had a 
drama group. In Marj al-Zuhur, we wrote and put up a play 
called `Deportation.' The play depicted the first 50 hours of 
our deportation, which were all agony. We sat opposite the 
actors and cried." 
  Have you learned a lesson from the deportation? I asked Dr. 
Duwayk. He smiled, laughed aloud, and then said: "Hamas is an 
Islamic movement whose sole purpose is to implement the dictates 
of Islam. There is no reason for the Hamas stand to change, 
because the Islam will not change. In Marj al-Zuhur we 
practiced the `sabir', patience and forbearance preached by the 
Islam. And most importantly, the extensive media coverage 
brought Hamas into every Palestinian house in the territories."

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 5 Jan (MENA)--Minister of Tourism Dr. 
Mamduh al-Biltaji has expressed optimism about the future of 
tourism in Egypt. [passage omitted] 
  At a meeting with a visiting U.S. Congressional delegation 
today, he reviewed the Tourism Ministry's future policy to 
revive tourism in Egypt, especially from the United States as an 
important tourism export market. 
  Speaking about Egypt's losses due to terrorism, he said 
Egypt 
has incurred losses at all levels. He added that these 
incidents have sharply and directly deepened the tourism crisis 
in Egypt. He noted that the number of tourists decreased from 
3.2 million in 1992 to 2.2 million as of October in 1993. 
Tourist nights decreased from about 20 million to around 13 
million as of October 1993 and tourism revenues dropped from 2.3 
billion in 1992 to 1.1 billion dollars as of October 1993. He 
pointed out that these statistics are serious indications as to 
the severity of the crisis. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Ahmad Hamrush: "What Will the Army Do in the </F>
Face of Terrorism?"] 
  [Excerpts] In his statement to the defense and national 
security committee of the People's Assembly, Defense Minister 
Field Marshal Husayn Tantawi raised an important issue affecting 
our daily lives--the issue of securing the internal front 
through coordination with the responsible ministries and 
services to deal with mounting terrorist activity. 
  There is no doubt that Egypt has not faced such a disturbing 
phenomenon in its modern history. Despite all the measures that 
the police are adopting with courage and devotion, the 
conditions that produce terrorism still exist, whether 
internally as a result of economic and social difficulties, the 
weakness of the political influence of the parties and the 
popular organizations, and the inability of some services to 
fulfill their role, particularly in the information field, or 
externally as a result of interference by some states that 
support the terrorists with money and political guidance. 
  Combating and ending terrorism is difficult to accomplish 
through the security services alone. A studied and integrated 
plan to group the responsible ministries in a higher council for 
combating terrorism is needed. [passage omitted] 
  The call for national dialogue shows the beginning of 
interest in and appreciation of the need to mobilize the efforts 
of all forces that believe in a civilized society and are 
against terrorism as a method of political action. Until such 
dialogue, which has caused much argument, takes place, the 
executive authority must establish this higher council to combat 
terrorism. This council should include the leaders of the 
political and party forces in order to have cohesion between the 
people and the government. 
  Defense Minister Tantawi's statement came at the appropriate 
time, because it shows the readiness of the Armed Forces to 
secure the internal front within the framework of constitutional 
legitimacy. [passage omitted] 
  After 20 years of peace following the October war, we feel 
that the phenomenon of terrorism exercised by groups that 
falsely call themselves Muslim have begun to represent a danger 
and threat to the internal front. This prompts us to ask about 
the role that the Armed Forces can play. Field Marshal Tantawi 
answered this question when he said that this can take place 
through coordination with the various ministries and services. 
  The Armed Forces can provide many services to promote 
production and develop the services. But this must be done as 
part of a studied government plan. Nevertheless, coordination 
between the police and the Armed Forces has become necessary to 
raise the standard of performance against terrorism. 
  I read a statement by Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi in 
AL-MUSAWWAR magazine in which he said some policemen are trained 
by the Army. This is good. But some manifestations indicate 
that either this is being done on a limited basis or that it is 
not part of a comprehensive scientific plan to raise the 
standard of the police force. [passage omitted] 
  This is not a call to give the Armed Forces a bigger role 
over the other political, legislative, and executive 
authorities. This is a call for coordination among all the 
forces that live in Egypt within the framework of a civilized 
society based on democracy and human rights.

  [Text] The State Security Investigation Department has 
escalated its oppressive campaign against the Muslim Brothers in 
al-Jizah. Three Muslim Brothers were detained in the past few 
days. They are Jamal 'Abd-al-Fattah 'Ashri, from al-Kunayyisah; 
Majdi 'Azzuz, from Imbabah; and Shawqi Ghazi. The latter was 
given electric shocks, sustained brain damage, and is still 
being treated at a mental hospital. The three were subjected to 
frightful torture at the hands of the state security 
investigation officers of the Jabir Ibn-Hayyan department, 
particularly Colonel Muhammad al-Dib, Major Sahrif Sirri, and 
'Adil 'Abd-al-Rahman. 
  The latest act of torture involved Jamal 'Ashri last 
Wednesday and Thursday. He was arrested after an exhibition on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was canceled. He was slashed and sensitive 
parts of his body were shocked. The officers torturing him 
asked him to work as an informer for them and provide them with 
information on the number of Muslim Brothers and their activity 
in al-Jizah. They threatened to hold him in custody if he 
refused to respond to these demands. 
  'Ashri reported the incident to the Egyptian Human Rights 
Organization.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Ahmad al-Malat: "Officials: Isn't It High </F>
Time You Sought Righteousness?"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] President Husni Mubarak has 
said on more than one occasion that he wants a dialogue with the 
various national and political forces. This statement pleases 
us. He recently told the French newspaper LE MONDE that "there 
is an Islamic movement that prefers political struggle to 
violence, that this movement joined certain social 
establishments, and that it has won the elections in certain 
vocational associations, such as the doctors, engineers, and 
lawyers associations and others." 
  If this is the president's approach, particularly his 
emphasizing that the Islamic movement does not favor violence, 
why do the security agencies and the disciples of the Vanguard 
Organization [an organization of Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir's era] 
insist on branding the Muslim Brotherhood as violent and 
extremist? Why is there this insistence that every bad thing 
that befalls this good country comes from under the Muslim 
Brotherhood cloak, as a former president once said? Officials: 
Don't you feel the direction of the wind coming from the mouth 
of the leader. If the president's wish is sincere, and we think 
it is, then this wish is a primary duty and must be fulfilled. 
  It is the truth that is almost bursting forth from the sick 
hearts in their war against Islam. We can hardly finish reading 
a statement when another slaps us on the face, kindling sorrow 
in our hearts over the loss of a Muslim's chivalry, honesty, and 
clear conscience. A few days ago at the College of Economics 
and Political Science, the education minister said: "There is a 
group that exploits religion to serve their own narrow political 
interests. If this group takes power, its program would be to 
hang those who uphold certain views." Yes, this is what he 
said, as if the advocates of Islam's tolerance, guidance, and 
purity are executioners and bloodthirsty. "It is a grievous 
thing that issues from their mouths as a saying. What they say 
is nothing but falsehood." [Koranic verse] 
  ROSE AL-YUSUF magazine, noted for its war against the Muslim 
Brotherhood, which was forced to speak the truth after it became 
clear to everyone that the Muslim Brotherhood won more than 47 
seats and the National Front won 56 seats in the Lawyers 
Association's by-elections. The Nasirist newspaper AL-'ARABI 
said that the Muslim Brotherhood won 40 seats, compared with the 
60 seats won by the National Front. I don't know what this 
National Front is. 
  If we accept these results, even though they are not true, 
it 
means that 40 percent of the lawyers voted for the Muslim 
Brotherhood. What more do you expect? It is an undeniable 
force, even though you do not recognize it. Is it in the 
interest of the homeland to cooperate with this large bloc of 
the people's representatives in the highest echelons or to 
antagonize it and conceal its reality and tangible efforts from 
the people? 
  Many civilized countries give the ruling authority to 
parties 
that wins less than 40 percent of the vote. The Zionist entity, 
your new ally, has been ruled by the Likud or the Labor Party 
with a smaller ratio. In the United States, power is exchanged 
between presidents: A president hands over power to his 
successor calmly and without uproar--and even congratulates him 
on his victory. Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton are examples 
of this. When will you learn? 
  The real results of the Lawyers Association by-elections in 
the governorates are known to the officials. These results are 
the real reason that the elections in Cairo were postponed. 
More that 56 percent of lawyers registered to vote in the 
general assembly elections, and the authorities realized beyond 
a shadow of doubt the overwhelming support for the Muslim 
Brotherhood. 
  The pretext of "you disturbed the water where I am drinking" 
is a story without end. It is the conflict between right and 
wrong that will continue until Doomsday, as our prophet, may 
God's prayers and peace be upon him, truthfully said. 
  Tell me: Does the public prosecutor have the right to 
suspend any elections indefinitely? Does the chairman of the 
judicial committee supervising the elections have the right to 
take such action? This is a breach of law and legality. We 
deem the Egyptian judiciary to be far above sinking in this 
stinking quagmire. Tell me: Can anyone stop the People's 
Assembly or the Consultative Council elections by submitting a 
notification to the public prosecutor that claims that there is 
a mistake in the voter rolls? 
  The Muslim Brotherhood does not fear voter turnout. Indeed, 
it contributed to the revival of voter participation. Recent 
elections show that the turnout is double what is used to be. 
  When the Brotherhood opposed Law No. 100, which requires a 
quorum of 50 percent of the members to convene an association's 
general assembly, it did not do so because it was afraid of 
losing seats. The Brotherhood opposed the law because it 
objected to the poor voter turnout throughout the country. 
  The Muslim Brotherhood took it upon itself to encourage 
people to participate in elections. Its success in the Lawyers 
Association elections illustrates its efforts in this 
connection. Indeed, we contend that the greater the number of 
voters, the greater the share of Muslim Brotherhood candidates. 
  The Asyut University Faculty Club elections prove what we 
say: More than 85 percent of the teaching staff voted. Our 
respected brother, Dr. Muhammad al-Sayyid Habib, the club's 
chairman, won 80 percent of the vote, greatly exceeding the 
number votes obtained by all other candidates. Are university 
professors terrorists? Do they encourage extremism and teach it 
to our young students? If this were the case for the cream of 
our men and scholars, what would happen to Egypt? People: is 
there not a sensible man left among you? 
  If we add what happened in the Lawyers Association elections 
to what, God willing, is likely to happen in other associations, 
particularly in the faculty elections in Asyut and other places 
where free and fair elections are held, we arrive at this 
question: Isn't it time for the authorities to revise their 
policy? How can they deprive the representatives of more than 
40 percent--a ratio they themselves admit--of the people their 
formal right to express their views? How can they deny free 
people recognition? 
  The Egyptian Government is trying to drive 'Arafat--claiming 
that he represents the Palestinians and the PLO--to conclude a 
peace deal with the Zionists, bloodthirsty cannibals that they 
are, who killed the prophets, displaced an entire nation, 
usurped its land, and turned its people into refugees. 
  The government is calling on the Sudanese Government to 
conclude a peace agreement with the rebels in the south who are 
seeking to separate the south from the mother country in order 
to establish a non-Muslim, pagan-Christian homeland. 
  Wouldn't it be better for the government to extend its hand 
to those who seek to make Egypt prosperous and proud and add 
strength to Islam? 
  Officials: Do you want it to become another Algeria, where 
innocent blood will be shed? We assure you that we do not want 
that. We believe what the impeccable Koran taught us: to deal 
with people with wisdom and good counsel. The people know the 
difference between food and bait and will not swallow your bait. 
  Both of us stand before the [ballot] box that does not 
lie--the free, honest box, the box that exposes all defects. We 
are like two racehorses, and you must accept the facts. The 
future, God willing, belongs to Islam, whether you like it or 
not. "The believers shall rejoice with the help of God. He 
helps whom He will, and He is exalted in Might, Most Merciful." 
[Koranic verse] 
  Hopefully you will hear and make the others who insist on 
shutting their ears to the resounding declaration of 
righteousness from the minarets hear as well. Or are their 
hearts under lock and key? 
  I can only remind them of the words of God, may He be 
blessed 
and exalted: "Has not the story reached you, of those who went 
before you--of the people of Noah, and 'Ad, and Thamud--and of 
those who came after them? None knows them but God. To them 
came apostles with clear signs but they put their hands up to 
their mouths, and said: We do deny the mission on which ye have 
been sent." [Koranic verse]

  [Text] Mahmud Muhammad Mahmud, minister of economy and 
foreign trade, has emphasized that the Egyptian economy has 
between 5 to 10 years to adjust to the GATT agreement, as part 
of the Uruguay round. He added: The measures we have adopted 
within the economic reform program are more strict than those 
stipulated under the GATT agreement. 
  Speaking yesterday at a meeting of the permanent committee 
that is following up on the GATT talks, the minister stressed 
the need to improve the quality of Egyptian products to be 
competitive with similar imported products both in the local and 
external markets. He added: Liberalizing trade is inevitable, 
but under this liberalization we will protect our products from 
illegal trade. He pointed out that the agreement made during 
the Uruguay round of talks, which lasted for seven years, will 
not result in any additional burdens that the Egyptian economy 
cannot handle. He added that the commitments on Egypt resulting 
from the liberalization of international trade are much less 
than those burdening other developing nations. 
  The committee will complete a study on the effects of the 
recent agreement on the Egyptian economy in the next few days.

  [Text] The ministerial economic group held a meeting today 
under Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi during which it continued

the steps for reforming the financial structure of the business 
sector companies by expanding the ownership base by selling some 
company shares to the people and employees. 
  Dr. Yusuf Butrus Ghali, minister of state for international 
cooperation, stated that the review showed that the rate of 
inflation has decreased to less than 10 percent, that the 
exchange rate of foreign currencies has remained stable, and 
that the budget deficit has not increased beyond the target 
limit. 
  He added that the review of the balance of payments showed

  [Text] Cairo, 5 Jan (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa said 
he and Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta discussed 
international issues of common interest, developments in the 
Middle East, the peace process, and cooperation among the 
Mediterranean countries. He said they also discussed the 
situation in many areas and bilateral relations. Musa was 
speaking at a joint news conference held with the Italian 
foreign minister following their talks today. 
  Musa noted first that President Husni Mubarak received the 
Italian foreign minister this morning. 
  The Italian foreign minister said he had the honor of 
meeting 
President Mubarak and left with the impression that the 
president is determined to achieve peace in the area. He noted 
that the Egyptian-Italian talks covered developments in the 
area, the peace process, and the situation in the Gulf region. 
  He paid tribute to the effort to achieve Middle East peace 
and expressed Italy's hope that the efforts will achieve their 
goals, especially in this vital region. He said he hopes a 
Palestinian solution will be achieved despite the obstacles. 
  He said they discussed Somalia and noted that he will 
discuss 
this problem and achieving security and stability there when he 
meets U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Brussels on 
Monday. 
  He explained that Italy realizes the importance of solving 
the Somali problem before the UN forces withdraw next March to 
prevent anarchy. 
  Andreatta added that Italy, which currently chairs the 
European Conference on Security and Cooperation, submitted a 
plan to increase cooperation with the Arab states. It included 
granting observer's status to Egypt, Morocco, and Algeria. 
  The Italian foreign minister said he asked Foreign Minister 
Musa, in his talks with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who 
is scheduled to visit Cairo on 16 January, to include the issue 
of increasing European cooperation with Egypt, Algeria, and 
Morocco. 
  He added that he and Musa also discussed bilateral 
relations. 
He said that despite the economic difficulties facing Italy, it 
will continue to provide assistance for development projects in 
Egypt. 
  On Bosnia, the Italian foreign minister said that despite 
the 
European Union's efforts, no agreement has been reached among 
the three parties to solve the problem. This has prompted the 
European countries to consider withdrawing their forces from 
Bosnia in an attempt to pressure the three parties to accept a 
peaceful solution to the problem. 
  The Italian foreign minister explained Italy's views on the 
GATT Agreement. He emphasized that it will free international 
trade and will not work at the expense of the developing 
countries. It will open markets to the products of the 
developing world, especially as tariffs will be reduced by 50 
percent. 
  Commenting on this issue, Foreign Minister Musa said that 
while international cooperation in international trade must be 
established, the talks in the Uruguay round took place mainly 
among the developed countries to serve their own interests and 
against the interests of the developing countries in some 
fields, particularly agricultural and food products. 
  He said the situation demands considering the interests of 
the developing countries and assisting them in a specific period 
to reform their economies and increase their production to 
enable them to compete. 
  Musa concluded the news conference, saying that in such 
circumstances, the agreement works in favor of the rich 
countries. He called for cooperation between the developing and 
developed countries to achieve the interests of both parties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Muhammad Jibril, Cairo </F>
representative of the National Front for the Salvation of Libya, 
in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] What are your justifications 
for accusing the Libyan regime of kidnapping [Mansur] al-Kikhya 
[Libyan opposition leader and former foreign minister]? Do you 
have any proof or material evidence to support your claim? 
  [Jibril] First of all I admit that we do not have any 
material evidence that would expose to the world the 
responsibility of the regime's agents for the abduction, but let 
me ask: As al-Kikhya is one of the most prominent people 
opposed to the current regime in Libya, who would have an 
interest in his disappearance? As al-Qadhdhafi has publicly 
said that he intends to liquidate the opposition, how is he 
going to achieve that without pursuit? 
  There is another important point which must be mentioned. It 
is the Libyan regime's black record of pursuing and liquidating 
opponents. Its agents have committed 23 attacks on Libyan 
opposition members living in European capitals, resulting in the 
martyrdom of most of them. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Have you received any direct threats 
from the Libyan authorities? 
  [Jibril] I have personally received dozens of threats from 
the regime's agents. They have told my family that their arm 
will reach me soon. Not to mention the official threats to all 
the Libyan opposition at home and abroad. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you feel that there was any Egyptian 
failure in connection with the disappearance of al-Kikhya? 
  [Jibril] I strongly deny even the slightest direct or 
indirect Egyptian role in the puzzle of al-Kikhya's 
disappearance, but I do believe that, in the event an agreement 
is signed with Egypt for the extradition of criminals, the 
Libyan regime would not hesitate to claim (falsely) that Egypt 
extradited al-Kikhya. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] How are you currently handling 
developments related to the al-Kikhya incident? 
  [Jibril] We are in continual daily contact with the relevant 
Egyptian authorities, and they are doing their best to solve the 
disappearance riddle. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Would the Libyan regime return al-Kikhya 
if, as you believe, he was kidnapped? 
  [Jibril] I rule that out completely, of course. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Libya has officially denied any 
connection with the al-Kikhya incident. 
  [Jibril] We expected that, after 10 days of official 
silence. We are used to such lies and games. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you have any information about a 
request by the Libyan regime asking Arab and European states to 
hand over opposition members? 
  [Jibril] Yes, al-Qadhdhafi has asked that of Egypt and other 
states. He even made the improvement of relations with any 
state conditional on their handing over the opposition members. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] Do you believe that the measures for 
guarding Libyan opposition members in Egypt are good? 
  [Jibril] Before the normalization of Egyptian-Libyan 
relations there was a strict guard for those opposed to 
al-Qadhdhafi but that was relaxed after al-Qadhdhafi promised 
the Egyptian authorities not to harm the opposition members 
living in Egypt. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] But could one say that Egypt has frozen 
the activities of the Libyan opposition in Egypt or that it has 
imposed restrictions on the movement of opposition members? 
  [Jibril] The restrictions on the Libyan opposition's 
activities were confined to the closure of their information 
offices and discontinuation of their coordination meetings, 
after the normalization of relations. But Egypt has not asked 
or forced any opposition member to leave the country. We hope 
that the Libyan political opposition will move from Europe and 
the United States to Egypt and the Arab states adjacent to Libya. 
  [AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT] What about the Libyan opposition at 
home? 
  [Jibril] Those opposed to the regime at home face the 
severest kinds of torture and pursuit. Suffice it to say that 
there are about 3,000 political detainees in Libyan prisons.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 Jan (MENA)--AL-WAFD says the deteriorating 
political and economic conditions in Yemen threaten pan-Arab 
security in this vital area on the southern approach to the Red 
Sea and are causing great frustration throughout the Arab 
nation. The paper says that it is a shame that hopes for Arab 
unity are foundering in this crucial Arab region. 
  In its Thursday [6 January] editorial, the paper, which is a 
mouthpiece of the opposition al-Wafd Party, links the bread 
demonstrations, which occurred amid an atmosphere filled with 
pessimism and disappointment, and the impending failure of 
unity, which came about after many years of struggle by the 
northern and southern parts of Yemen. 
  The paper notes the repercussions of political differences 
between the two conflicting leaders, 'Ali Salih and Salim 
al-Bid, on the political and economic situation in the country. 
It adds that the differences have reached the point of 
threatening separation and loss of unity. 
  The paper expresses hope that the Yemeni people will heal 
their political wounds and preserve the unity of their country. 
It also expresses hope that, for the sake of the Yemeni people, 
the views will converge and the rift will not increase so that 
the Yemeni people can deal with their economic problems and sail 
to the shore of safety.

  [Text] Cairo, 5 Jan (MENA)--His Beatitude Pope Shanudah, 
pastor of the Coptic Church in Egypt, stated that the Vatican is 
a state and not merely a church. He added that the pope only 
represents the Catholic Church and that all other churches 
remain outside its policy. He said: As far as we are concerned, 
we have well-known disagreements with the Jews. 
  These remarks were made in an interview in AL-MUSAWWAR 
magazine that will be published Friday, 7 January. The pope was 
commenting on the establishment of diplomatic ties between the 
Vatican and Israel. 
  Pope Shanudah said that the establishment of ties between 
the 
Vatican and Israel does not constitute a reconciliation between 
the Jews and Christians. If the Jews want to be absolved of the 
blood of Christ, they have to believe in him, Shanudah said. 
  We will not go to Jerusalem unless we all go together, he 
said, adding that reports about visits by Coptic tourists to 
Jerusalem are untrue and merely [word indistinct]. We are still 
preventing Copts from visiting Jerusalem, he affirmed. 
  Asked about his opinion of the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles, Shanudah said that it is the first 
step and could be followed by many other steps leading to the 
realization of the Palestinian dream of building a homeland. 
What is happening now are merely steps toward a solution. 
  The pope said that the principle of the balance of powers 
does not work when Israel has nuclear weapons and the other 
states in the region do not. 
  We do not fear the establishment of a Middle Eastern market 
because the Arab world and Egypt have many capabilities and do 
not suffer from lack of manpower, intelligence, or technology. 
  Shanudah added: We do not fear extremist thought, but we are 
against violence as a way of spreading ideas and forcing them on 
the people.

  [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. O heroic Sudanese people: 
  When Britain sent Peter Streams as its ambassador to Sudan, 
he felt the greatness of his responsibility in being sent to a 
rebellious country, one that was difficult to shackle since it 
had emerged from the well into which it had been thrown by its 
own abilities. Streams was determined to equip himself with 
[word indistinct] of his predecessors, (Ford), Kitchener, 
Wingate, Gordon and Slatin. 
  He drew from his fertile imagination [word indistinct] entry 
into Khartoum enveloped in the mantle of history and riding 
haughtily in a strong saddle and surrounded by the crowds, 
disbursing before him gifts and presents to the [?poor] [words 
indistinct]. 
  Why not? For he is a descendant of the resident of the first 
palace and a man of action and will, in what they call the Third 
World. Thus, the foundations of the British Embassy were weaker 
than the ambassador's dreams [words indistinct]. 
  His excellency the ambassador began the battle having 
preceded it with a media campaign of defamation. It was 
circulated at gatherings that his blessed advent would put an 
end to the government of the National Salvation Revolution and 
would arrange its end. The honor of the English nobility does 
not permit the erasure of anything they have written with their 
own pens, and no culture or civilization could be (?better) than 
what they had. Politicians should not dismiss those who are 
close to them, and their beloved ones should not be left out of 
ministerial positions. 
  The British ambassador led an active campaign to discourage 
Western ambassadors from attending the country's celebrations, 
marking the fourth anniversary of the revolution, so as not to 
give the government any legitimacy, according to Streams. He 
promised them they would wait and see the death of the 
revolution as a result of his efforts. The British ambassador 
was the most frequent visitor to the camps of the displaced 
persons. He would knock on their doors before dawn prayers, 
when they undress in the afternoon and after the second evening 
prayers [salat al-isha]. He shed tears at the demonstrations of 
misery and wretchedness. He [word indistinct] the haphazard 
housing like the poet in the days of ignorance. He described 
the lake of the Jabal Awliya Dam as the heart of the desert. He 
described the planning of new towns and town quarters as 
deportation of supporters of a party he named which used to have 
cordial relations with his leadership. 
  Ambassador Peter Streams expressed his readiness to amend 
the 
itinerary of the EC delegation to divert it to what he thought 
would be displeasing to them. He wanted to influence the 
delegation's reports, which he believed might otherwise be 
useful to his enemy, Sudan. The British ambassador persevered 
in writing fabricated reports to such an extent that he 
established a particular image in the minds of the recipients of 
his reports, in addition to their media. He was thus afraid 
that the image would change every time a British delegation's 
visit was imminent, out of his fear that the delegation might 
see the truth and discover his lies. We see him using one of 
the important loopholes of British politics, separating religion 
from the state, and the call for secularism in government and 
safeguards against the influence of faith. 
  He wanted to plug a loophole of interest to him, namely the 
lack of clarity in his patched up reports. He went in a rush to 
the speaker of the Transitional Assembly, and told him, making 
it almost an order, that Streams should be the host of the 
archbishop of Canterbury, that is, the Anglican Church. He 
wanted to be host to him in his own house and to be the one to 
draw up the visit's programs and meetings -- otherwise the visit 
would have to be canceled. 
  He seemed to want to put the government in the embarrassing 
position of acceptance or rejection. He obviously reckoned that 
he would win the round. When he saw that the government would 
not concede part of its sovereignty, he rushed off to Britain 
[words indistinct] and that Sudan was imposing restrictions on 
the archbishop's visit, fixing his program, and refusing to 
allow the Sudanese Episcopal Church to be host to him. Moreover 
the British Embassy was more deserving of his [word indistinct] 
in the August presence of Peter Streams. 
  He claimed that Sudan was shutting the door in the face of 
the visit. However, British wisdom pushed the archbishop into 
Sudan through the back door (?to be the guest of) [word 
indistinct] the agent rebels. Thus the visit had to take place 
according to the wishes of Great Britain and not according to 
the wishes of Sudan. In this way the aging empire struck the 
final wedge in Western credibility, which had been filling the 
world with talk of freedoms, human rights, democracy, and the 
separation of religion and state. As for freedom: Look at its 
creation of the Zionist entity in the Arab land. Human rights 
are being practiced in Bosnia, with Britain's support. As for 
democracy, they are opposed to it unless it gives birth to what 
they love, and there is much proof of this. 
  As for the separation of religion and the state, this is 
what 
Peter Streams, the British ambassador to Sudan, has done. If 
the separation is real, then what business does the embassy have 
in the archbishop's visit when the embassy is the state? What 
business does it have with the (?Episcopal) church and its 
parishioners? Why should the visit become political, tarnishing 
the name of Sudan as is being done by that Jewish radio in 
London? Why was the visit directed to the zone of military and 
political conflict where there are no civilian citizens? Is it 
for the defeated rebellion to present its demands for arms from 
the archbishop at a time when so many southerners have taken 
refuge in their homeland in the north? When did the leaders of 
the rebellion abandon the atheistic communist influence and 
forget the era of the manifesto [as heard] and become apostles 
of Jesus Christ? 
  But all this is nothing more than a lack of capability and 
defeat, which destroyed those who were seeking support for a 
crusade, as they suggested to the archbishop, while continuing 
to fight among themselves as a result of the struggle for 
leadership and interests, ethnic interests and the rancor of 
desperate souls. 
  Pope John Paul was right when he came to Khartoum and 
received a great welcome from its people. He met his followers 
and prayed with them safely into the night -- yet in other 
Christian countries he is surrounded by armored glass. He was 
indeed a friend of Sudan. 
  As for Ambassador Streams, he should (?remember) Kordofan. 
How it managed to extinguish the lives of a whole army in one 
hour -- it was led by Kitchener [words indistinct]. Remember 
the iron sword which reached the neck of the sacred General 
Gordon [word indistinct] on that day of liberation in 1885, and 
left so much grief in the heart of the foggy capital. 
  Had Peter looked to history it would have told him the 
truth. 
But he did not, preferring to send fabricated reports about the 
Sudanese people. That is why he is returning to Great Britain 
after having lost his bid. He has not succeeded in what he 
promised his fellow ambassadors concerning changing the Sudanese 
regime. He has revealed a lie which was earlier concealed -- 
the lie of separating religion from the state. This was urged 
so much by Britain, and repeated by its parrots. The people of 
Islam must rule their life. The Sudanese people should thank 
God for the merit of our predecessors. The British Embassy will 
continue to be a symbol of contacts between peoples in equal 
measure, like other embassies, that is, if its people want to 
have contacts without conditions, arrogance and conspiracy. 
Sudan covets nothing from Britain because it is able to assess 
Britain's situation and the notions of the past that it suffers 
from, as well as the problems of its complicated present -- 
being overpowered by America and influenced by the Jews. 
  Long live the revolution, with its bright and dignified 
banners on the brown masts of Sudan. Long live the unoppressed 
people [words indistinct]. God is great and dignity to Sudan.

  [Excerpts] The office of the Democratic Unionist Party 
[DUP] leader has issued a statement saying that this year's 
independence anniversary comes while all of Sudan is suffering 
under the yoke of al-Turabi's [National Islamic] Front, shackled 
by all sorts of restrictions that conflict with this great 
anniversary and make independence lose its true meaning. 
  The statement says that oppression, coercion, displacement, 
imprisonment, and torture are the main characteristics 
dominating the people of Sudan. The regime is also fanning the 
flames of the civil war, which it falsely calls jihad, and 
flagrantly encroaching on the rights of the Sudanese in ways 
that the Sudanese people have never experienced before, even 
during the era of colonialism. [passage omitted] 
  In a similar statement, the Ummah Party said the 
independence 
anniversary comes at a time when the military regime in 
Khartoum, despite international condemnation for human right 
violations, is continuing the oppression, pursuit, physical 
liquidation, and torture of its opponents. The statement said 
the regime is continuing to fan the flames of the civil war, 
which is a scourge that is crushing citizens in the south.

  [Text] The Democratic National Grouping has issued a 
statement emphasizing that the Sudanese people have triumphed 
because of the will and unity of the people. The statement 
added that Sudan, which became an independent state on 1 January 
1956, is also capable of defeating the forces of darkness, 
regaining its freedom, and rebuilding a democratic state. 
  The statement noted that the 38th anniversary of 
independence 
comes at a time when there is a 60-percent shortage of grain in 
the country, something that is subjecting more than 10 million 
Sudanese to the threat of death from starvation. Furthermore, 
the lives of millions of Sudanese in the north and central part 
of the country are threatened by fatal epidemics, including 
malaria. The statement pointed out that this year's 
independence celebration must be an occasion for the grouping to 
ponder its future steps in a spirit of solidarity and unity to 
regain the freedom of Sudan.

  [Text] The National Democratic Grouping [NDG] has denounced 
the Sudanese Government's decision to sell state public 
utilities to hypocritical pro-regime merchants. A statement 
issued by the NDG's Information Committee said that the Sudanese 
regime has not been content with imposing high taxes on the 
people to overcome its acute economic crisis. It has started to 
sell the Sudanese people's remaining vital utilities, such as 
the government's tannery and Sudanese Airways. 
  The statement denounced the government's intention to sell 
the prisons in Omdurman, Kabar, and Port Sudan to complement its 
previous plans. The statement stressed that these utilities are 
public properties that should not be disposed of without the 
consent of the freely elected representatives of the people. 
The statement warned everyone against submitting tenders to buy 
these properties, stressing that the sale contracts would be 
null and void and that the ownership of these properties would 
revert to the Sudanese people once the regime is toppled.

  [Text] The Sudan did not receive any official note from the 
Eritrean Government on the statement attributed to Eritrean 
President Isayas Afewerki on the infiltration of hostile 
elements into his country across the Sudanese border, the 
foreign minister, Dr. Husayn Abu-Salih, said. 
  Speaking at the Foreign Ministry's regular forum, Abu-Salih 
reiterated that the Sudan and Eritrea maintain strong and 
fraternal relations, pointing out that the two countries ties 
have been found [as heard] on strong principles. He said the 
Sudan had extended continuous support to the Eritrean liberation 
struggle till the country achieved independence, and that the 
Sudan was among the first countries who supported Eritrea as an 
independent state. 
  The foreign minister went on say that the Sudan now hosts 
half a million Eritreans. Less than half of them are living in 
nine camps under the supervision of the Sudanese Refugees 
Administration. The refugees camps house refugees from all 
colors of the political spectrum, the foreign minister said, 
stressing that the refugees are not allowed to exercise any form 
of political activity. Abu-Salih indicated that the Sudan 
provides 75 percent of the needs of the Eritrean refugees while 
the international community extends only 25 percent of their 
requirements, calling for the conclusion of a tripartite 
agreement between the governments of the Sudan and Eritrea and 
the UNHCR to organize the voluntary repatriation of the Eritrean 
refugees.

<F P=106> [Four-part article by Sulayman Nimr: "Riyadh's Gulf Summit </F>
Files; Regional Dangers and How To Deal With Them; `Defense and 
Deterrence' Summit; Arab Situation and Peace Process 
Developments; Bilateral Meetings and Border Issues"] 
<H5>  [19 Dec pp 1, 4] </H5>
  [Text] Riyadh--When leaders of the GCC [Gulf Cooperation 
Council] member states meet to discuss Gulf cooperation in 
Riyadh tomorrow, they will find that the titles of the files 
that they will peruse and discuss are not different from the 
titles of files of summits past. The issues, which will be 
discussed by the six leaders, are the same old issues that are 
discussed ordinarily in all important Gulf meetings. These 
issues are: regional conditions, relations with Iran and Iraq, 
Arab conditions in light of the latest peace process 
developments, and economic, defense, and security cooperation 
issues. 
  Regarding regional conditions, the Gulf continues to be 
worried by its two big neighbors, Iraq and Iran. Problems with 
these two countries remain unresolved. With the continued 
presence of Saddam Husayn's regime, Iraq will continue to 
represent to Gulf people a source of danger, which they have not 
yet found out how to repel. The Gulf is more worried by the fact 
that the Iraqi regime has not fallen and that it has survived 
despite the economic and political embargo and despite the 
destruction of whatever remaining sophisticated armament 
capabilities it had than by the border incidents Iraq fabricates 
with Kuwait from time to time. 
  What escalates this worry is the fact that this year, which 
will end in a few days, has seen political and economic breaches 
of the embargo imposed on Iraq, as in the case of the return of 
Turkish diplomats to Iraq and of Turkey's call for lifting the 
economic embargo imposed on Iraq. What is more important is that 
despite the unified Gulf policy and position vis-a-vis Iraq and 
its regime, the State of Qatar has held separate contacts with 
Iraq. The latest such contact was the visit paid by the Qatari 
deputy chief of staff to Baghdad and his meeting with President 
Saddam Husayn at the beginning of this month. This visit has 
enraged Kuwait which, it has been learned, threatened not to 
hold any meetings with Qatar's leadership during the summit. But 
Gulf contacts have managed to pacify matters and Qatar has 
issued an official statement characterizing the Qatar deputy 
chief of staff's visit to Baghdad as "private." 
  The fact that Saddam Husayn's regime has not fallen despite 
the embargo, failure of the wager that Iraqi opposition would 
succeed in toppling the regime, and political and economic 
breaches of the embargo against Iraq will undoubtedly motivate 
the Gulf states to consider future conditions vis-a-vis Iraq. 
Even though the Gulf states are not expected to reconsider the 
Iraq boycott resolutions, a fait accompli exists and the Gulf 
states cannot ignore the effect of its continued presence on 
their security. Neither can they ignore the dangers this fait 
accompli poses nor the fact that they must learn how to confront 
and deal with it. 
  There is no doubt that the Gulf leaders will review these 
developments in the Iraqi issue and will exchange views on 
future conditions in Iraq, without offering any concession on 
the continued boycott against the current regime. 
  It seems that Iran, the other fundamental part of the Gulf 
formula, will continue to be one of the concerns that worry the 
region, even though some Gulf states are tied to it by good 
bilateral relations that have developed this year. But neither 
developed bilateral relations between Iran on the one hand and 
Qatar and Kuwait on the other nor the tour Iranian Foreign 
Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati made to the region last May have 
alleviated the Gulf's general concern about Iran and its policy 
in the region. The main reason is the continued Iranian-UAE 
[United Arab Emirates] crisis over the three UAE islands (the 
Greater Tunb, the Lesser Tunb, and Abu-Musa islands) and Iran's 
intensification of this crisis by appointing a governor for 
Abu-Musa island and by refusing to enter into direct 
negotiations with Abu Dhabi to resolve the islands' issue. 
  Riyadh's Gulf summit will deliberate on and discuss the 
Iranian-UAE crisis to explore the possibilities and likelihood 
of developing a solution to this crisis, which has reflected in 
turn on the Iranian-Gulf relations generally. 
  In this regard, it is not expected that one or more Gulf 
states will mediate between between Abu Dhabi and Tehran because 
the UAE rejects such mediation in order to assert that the 
position taken toward its three islands is a collective Gulf 
position. 
  Informed Gulf sources have said that the UAE insists on 
direct negotiations with Iran to resolve the islands issue and 
that it wants absolutely no Gulf mediation. 
  In view of the Gulf's continued concern about the two big 
neighbors, Iraq and Iran, the GCC states find that they have to 
agree on a political and security plan to deal with this 
security and defense concern. 
  At the security and defense levels, the Gulf states launched 
in the past two years plans to bolster their military 
capabilities and they have concluded weapons deals valued at 
several billion dollars. Some states, like Kuwait, have 
concluded military treaties with major powers in the new world 
order to underline their responsibility to protect Kuwait from 
any military adventure. There is no doubt that the GCC states 
will carry on with their policy to bolster their military 
capabilities while focusing on joint defense cooperation. But 
how will the regional dangers be tackled politically? 
  Observers expect that Gulf leaders will present their 
visions 
and ideas in this regard so that their foreign ministers will 
implement these ideas and visions. Within the context of the 
discussion on the region's situation, Gulf diplomatic sources 
expect that the Gulf summit will discuss the developments in 
Yemen and their impact on the region. Observers believe that the 
Sultanate of Oman, which strengthened its relations with Yemen 
this year through the visit Sultan Qabus Ibn Sa'id made to Sanaa 
last October, will have its own opinion on what is going on in 
Yemen and on how to deal with it. The Omani viewpoint is founded 
on the basis that in the Gulf formula, Yemen, Iran, and Iraq are 
significant figures that cannot be ignored or not dealt with and 
that one cannot deal with one of them at the expense of another. 
<H5>  [20 Dec pp 1,4] </H5>
  [Text] If 'Abdullah Bisharah, who is well-known for his 
proverbial monikers, were still the GCC [Gulf Cooperation 
Council] secretary general, he would call the 14th Gulf summit 
the "defense and deterrence summit." Military and defense 
aspects will occupy an important place in the Riyadh summit in 
light of the accord reached by the defense ministers to bolster 
military cooperation among their armies, to develop the 
Peninsula Shield capabilities, and to reinforce the joint 
military capabilities in order to develop the joint Gulf 
capability. 
  At meetings held in Abu Dhabi from 8-9 November 1993, the 
GCC 
defense ministers agreed on plans to develop joint defense 
cooperation and to start implementing a long-term plan to 
develop the Peninsula Shield forces and to establish a security 
belt around the six Gulf states. 
  Official Gulf sources have disclosed that the plans to 
develop joint Gulf defense cooperation include the following: 
  A. Establish around the GCC states a defensive security belt 
that calls for setting up an air defense network and an early 
air warning system--created by tying all of the six states' air 
defense networks and radars to each other--and for establishing 
new warning points and linking them to each other so they will 
be under the control of a single command that is linked to the 
Saudi-owned AWACS [Airborne Warning and Control Systems] planes. 
  B. Develop the Peninsula Shield forces, bolster their weapon 
capabilities, and increase their numbers so they will become 
25,000-strong in the next three years, as stated by GCC 
Secretary General Shaykh Fahim al-Qasimi. 
  In the first phase of this plan, military units from the 
various corps of the armies of the GCC states will be selected 
to join the Peninsula Shield forces and their command at their 
main location in the town of Hafr al-Batin, northeastern Saudi 
Arabia. Units from the air and naval forces of the GCC armies 
will be tied to the Peninsula Shield command. Perhaps the most 
significant point in the plan to develop the Peninsula Shield 
forces is the creation of a unified armored Gulf division under 
the command of these forces. 
  There is no doubt that approval of these plans by the six 
leaders will give the go-ahead signal for immediate 
implementation. Thus, the GCC will enter a new phase during 
which the emphasis is put on the endeavor to achieve a principle 
the GCC has already raised, namely that the "region's security 
and stability are the responsibility of its citizens." This is 
not enough for the GCC states to safeguard the region's security 
by themselves in the presence of two regional powers, namely 
Iraq and Iran. The objective of this step is, according to a 
Gulf official, to "create a force that will deter any party that 
contemplates embarking on an adventure similar to Saddam 
Husayn's adventure, for which Kuwait has paid a dear price. This 
means that the region's states will not just trust the 
protection of their security to the major powers but will also 
assume their responsibilities in this regard." 
  The fact is that the plan to create an early air warning 
system in the region is not new, considering that it was 
presented to the seventh summit in Abu Dhabi in 1988. But the 
debate on financing this system, on its command, and on the 
headquarters of this command, as well as on the locations of the 
warning centers, caused the Gulf states to delay agreement on 
the system until the Kuwait catastrophe occurred. In the wake of 
that catastrophe, Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman, assigned by 
the GCC states, presented his plan to create a unified Gulf army 
to the 12th Gulf summit in Kuwait. Because of some 
sensitivities, it was agreed to amend the plan and to proceed 
with drafting plans to develop the Peninsula Shield forces so 
they would constitute the nucleus of a unified Gulf force. 
  When the political will materialized, the Gulf chiefs of 
staff were able to overcome the obstacles and sensitivities that 
had obstructed approval of the joint Gulf defense cooperation 
plans in accordance with the strategy embraced by the GCC states 
in the 1985 Muscat summit. The defense ministers then approved 
the plans drafted by the chiefs of staff to establish a security 
belt and to develop all particulars of the Peninsula Shield 
forces, especially those particulars connected with establishing 
a joint command system that provides for the periodic 
alternation of chiefs of staffs of these forces and with the 
method of financing creation of the air [defense] system and the 
expenditures required for the Peninsula Shield forces. 
  While defense and military cooperation accomplished a 
significant step through what has been agreed, Gulf security 
cooperation also took a considerable step toward reaching a 
unified Gulf agreement when Kuwait dropped its former 
reservations about some of the clauses in the security agreement 
during the meeting of the interior ministers held last month in 
Abu Dhabi. These reservations are connected with the subject of 
pursuit of criminals and smugglers across borders and capturing 
suspects and trying them. 
  Kuwait's withdrawal of its reservations raised hopes that 
this agreement would be signed. Prince Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, 
the Saudi interior minister, thinks of it as "the tool and 
fundamental instrument to implement the joint security strategy" 
which the GCC countries agreed upon in 1987. Prince Nayif 
expressed these hopes when he announced in Abu Dhabi last month 
that "the interior ministers have taken the necessary steps to 
put the security agreement in the final format to be signed 
within the next year." 
  The summit working papers which the leaders will study 
include the joint security agreement and a number of 
recommendations which are related to unification of other 
security and legal measures. 
<H5>  [21 Dec pp 1, 4] </H5>
  [Text] The Arab file presented to the 14th Gulf summit in 
Riyadh includes three reports drafted by the Gulf foreign 
ministers for their leaders to debate when the discussion deals 
with the Arab issue. These reports are: 
  First, the rapid developments in the Middle East peace 
process, their impact on the Gulf states since the 
Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles was concluded, and 
the talk about endeavors to establish a new Mideastern order to 
replace the Arab order that has been toppled by the consequences 
of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
  There is no doubt that the region's entry into the peaceful 
settlement phase has created new given facts and that the Arab 
Gulf states are required to deal with these developments and to 
participate in them, either by supporting and aiding the 
settlement process and the peace negotiations between the Arab 
parties and Israel or by participating in the multilateral 
Middle East talks that seek to underline Israel's participation 
in the region's issues. From the outset, the GCC states 
supported the peaceful settlement talks and contributed to the 
contacts that were held in the initial phases to get to the 
negotiations. Moreover, the GCC states have supported the 
Palestinian-Israeli declaration of principles as a first step 
toward a "just and comprehensive peace that accomplishes Israeli 
withdrawal from all the occupied Arab territories." 
  When asked to finance the World Bank plan to provide 
economic 
aid to self-rule, the Gulf states did contribute. Saudi Arabia 
announced a contribution of $100 million and the UAE a 
contribution of $50 million for the first year. 
  The report prepared for the Gulf summit on the peace process 
developments focuses on two main issues, namely: 
  A. The Arab boycott of Israel: The report asserts that the 
position of the GCC states agrees with the Arab League 
resolution that emphasizes the continued Arab boycott of Israel. 
  B. Multinational negotiations: The report believes that 
there 
is no objection to achieving progress in the negotiations in 
which the GCC states participate parallel to the progress made 
in the peace process. 
  It is to be noted that Qatar and Oman will host next year 
the 
meetings of two committees of the multi-national negotiation 
committees. 
  As for providing Gulf aid to the Palestinian self-rule, it 
is 
not expected that the Gulf summit will issue a unanimous 
resolution on this issue. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud 
al-Faysal has noted that the "GCC states have declared in their 
turn, each state separately, that they will aid the 
Palestinians." 
  It is to be noted that Kuwait wanted a collective resolution 
on Gulf participation in this aid. It seems from the emphasis, 
which the report submitted to the Gulf summi,t puts on the 
issues of the Arab boycott of Israel and the multinational 
negotiations that the GCC states believe that these are the dues 
required of them currently in connection with the peaceful 
settlement process. 
  As for other dues, such as the status of Palestinians 
residing in the GCC states, the Gulf capitals see that they are 
not required to resettle these Palestinians in their own 
countries and that these Palestinians will continue to be 
treated the same as residents from other Arab nationalities. 
<H5>  Damascus Proclamation </H5>
  Second, the second report in the Arab file presented to the 
summit concerns the Damascus proclamation. Even though the 
foreign ministers of the Damascus proclamation signatory states 
held a meeting in Abu Dhabi last June in an attempt to revive 
this proclamation on new bases and to draft a new protocol to 
implement it, it is noticed that talk about the proclamation has 
diminished and disappeared. Even the experts committee, which 
was formed of the eight states that signed the proclamation in 
March 1991 and was supposed to meet at the beginning of this 
month to draft a protocol on the mechanism for implementing the 
proclamation--even this committee has not met. Consequently, the 
meeting scheduled to be held this month in the Syrian capital by 
the proclamation foreign ministers has not been held either. 
  Gulf sources said that the GCC states have been waiting for 
Egypt to take the initiative and call for holding the experts 
committee meeting and waiting for news from Syria, in its 
capacity as the host state, on convocation of the foreign 
ministers meeting. But nothing has been determined to date. 
  Observers believe that all this indicates that the Damascus 
proclamation has ended up being no more than just another Arab 
joint action document. In this regard, observers note what Yusuf 
Bin-'Alawi, the Omani minister of state for foreign affairs, 
said in Cairo last July, namely that "results of the Damascus 
proclamation will appear in five centuries." 
  But official Gulf sources assert that the Damascus 
proclamation continues to exist and that all efforts seek to 
transform it into a formula for inter-Arab relations within the 
framework of the Arab League. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned that a recommendation included in the 
report the foreign ministers have submitted the summit calls for 
entrusting the State of Qatar to contact Egypt in order to set a 
date for a meeting of the protocol-drafting experts committee in 
preparation for setting a date for the next meeting of the 
Damascus proclamation foreign ministers. 
<H5>  Inter-Arab Relations </H5>
  Third, the third report in the Arab file concerns the status 
of inter-Arab relations, especially the Gulf relations with the 
other Arab countries. Even though three years have passed since 
the liberation of Kuwait, Arab relations continue to be the 
captive of the conditions and consequences generated by this 
war. Generally, the GCC countries' relations with some Arab 
countries (Jordan, Sudan, Yemen, Palestine) have not experienced 
any significant positive developments, even though Oman has 
opened up to all these countries and even though Qatar has had 
good contacts and relations with these countries, including Iraq 
itself. 
  This year, some relaxation developed in the relations of a 
number of Gulf states with the PLO when Chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
visited Muscat last September and had a one-hour stopover at Abu 
Dhabi airport. But what is more important than this is the 
visits made by Palestinian officials (Mahmud 'Abbas and others) 
to some Gulf capitals. 
  Observers believe that the peace process developments have 
been the main motive behind the relaxation in the Gulf relations 
with the PLO. But Arab Gulf states continue to have their 
reservations on 'Arafat, even though the U.S. administration has 
urged them to deal with 'Arafat in wake of his approval of the 
Oslo accord. It seems that these reservations are what is 
slowing the restoration of fully normal Gulf relations with the 
PLO. 
  What emerges from the course of the Gulf relations with the 
Arab countries is that it is left up to each Gulf state to 
determine its relations with the other Arab countries according 
to its interest, even though Kuwait continues to refuse to 
establish relations with those whom it calls the "adversary 
states." However, observers believe that in wake of the latest 
peace process developments, future conditions in the Middle East 
region will dictate enacting the concept of "joint interests." 
This concept requires the presence of a strong Arab role in the 
Gulf region because the GCC states, which seek to become a 
regional power in the area in order to make up for the 
imbalance, cannot play this role without an Arab wall on which 
to lean. There is no doubt that the leaders of the GCC states 
will make the decision on such strategic resolutions. 
<H5>  [22 Dec pp 1, 4] </H5>
  [Text] Even though border issues and problems between some 
Gulf states are not ordinarily presented on the Gulf summit 
agendas, bilateral meetings held on the summit sidelines provide 
an opportunity to discuss endless and problematic border issues. 
At times, and especially when raised in the media, these issues 
almost cause the GCC states' relations with each other to be 
stormy, as in the case of the Saudi-Qatari border dispute, which 
erupted more than a year ago. If it had not been settled two 
days before convocation of the Abu Dhabi summit, this dispute 
would have nearly blocked the GCC march. 
  Most GCC states, especially Saudi Arabia, believe that 
common 
border problems are easier to solve if they are kept out of the 
media limelights and provocation. This is what happened nearly 
two months ago between the UAE and Saudi Arabia when Abu Dhabi 
issued on 24 October 1993 a federal decree delineating the UAE 
maritime borders in the Arab Gulf and in the Sea of Oman, 
including both UAE internal and territorial waters. The law 
[decree] defines the UAE territorial sea as a water strip 
extending 12 nautical miles beyond the UAE internal and 
territorial waters. The law imposes certain conditions, which 
require that merchant ships and military boats and submarines 
vessels acquire an advance permit from the UAE authorities 
before they sail into and cross the UAE territorial waters. 
  Because Saudi Arabian and UAE sea and land borders overlap 
in 
the Khawr al- 'Adid area, southeast of Qatar and close to the 
Saudi-Qatari-UAE border triangle, this meant that the 
territorial border delineated by the new law, which extends the 
UAE territorial zones, would cross into the Saudi coastline in 
the Khawr al-'Adid area. The law would have caused tension to 
prevail in the region's relations if it had not been for the 
quiet contacts held between the two countries far from the 
limelights, including the meeting Saudi Interior Minister Prince 
Nayif Bin-'Abd-al- 'Aziz had with Shaykh Bin-Zayid Sultan and 
the subsequent visit by Hamdan Bin-Zayid, the UAE minister of 
state for foreign affairs; and Ahmad Khalifah al-Suwaydi, Shaykh 
Zayid's chief adviser and the expert on all of the region's 
borders; to Jeddah and their meeting with King Fahd 
Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, custodian of the two holy mosques. It was 
emphasized at that meeting that the law delineating the UAE 
territorial waters and zones was not intended to violate the 
Saudi rights to the territories and coastline agreed upon in 
1974. Thus, a page of border problems, which were tackled 
quietly and with utter confidentiality, was turned over. This 
confirms that the Saudi approach to deal with border problems 
quietly is a sound approach. 
  There is no doubt that the peripheral meetings, which will 
be 
held on the sidelines of the Gulf summit in Riyadh, will include 
a meeting between the Saudi monarch and Shaykh Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the ruler of Qatar, to follow-up on the 
solution to the border problems between the two countries. An 
agreement has been reached on these problems and it calls for 
forming a technical committee to oversee demarcation of the 
borders. It was agreed on this committee at a meeting held one 
year ago in al-Madinah between King Fahd, Shaykh Khalifah, and 
President Husni Mubarak. 
  It has been learned from Gulf diplomatic sources that the 
technical committee has held one meeting. There is no doubt that 
King Fahd and Qatar's ruler will emerge with an understanding on 
how to continue implementing their agreement. 
  Political circles view peripheral and bilateral meetings 
between Gulf leaders with great interest because these meetings 
determine features of the Gulf understanding on various issues, 
especially bilateral issues between the six states. These issues 
are not, of course, confined to border problems but also include 
other issues, especially disagreement in opinions on certain 
relations or contacts made by one state and viewed with 
sensitivity by another, such as the misunderstanding that has 
developed between Kuwait and Qatar over growing Qatari relations 
with Iraq. There is no doubt that the Kuwaitis do not view what 
they call Qatari opening up to Baghdad with satisfaction. This 
is particularly true of the visit made by the Qatari deputy 
chief of staff to Baghdad at the beginning of this month. This 
visit provoked greater Kuwaiti resentment and could have created 
tension in the relations with Doha had not Saudi Arabia 
intervened promptly and pacified matters and had not Doha issued 
a statement asserting that the deputy chief of staff's visit to 
Baghdad was a private visit. 
  During the Gulf ministerial meeting last Saturday, Kuwaiti 
Foreign Minister Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad proceeded to meet with 
his Qatari counterpart, Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al Thani, in an 
endeavor to settle the misunderstanding between their two 
countries and to pave the way for a meeting between their two 
leaders. In fact, Shaykh Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah and Shaykh 
Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani did meet in Riyadh on the first day 
of the summit. There is no doubt that this meeting has 
contributed to settling the misunderstanding. 
<H5>  Economic File </H5>
  In addition to the important peripheral and bilateral 
meetings between the Gulf states' leaders, another important 
file on the summit agenda is the economic file. 
  Whereas the 14th Gulf summit will see positive and important 
progress achieved in joint defense and security cooperation, 
Gulf circles have been "disappointed" by the failure to reach 
agreement to date on the unified customs tariff which, according 
to Dr. 'Abdullah al-Quwayz, GCC assistant secretary general for 
economic affairs, was supposed to be reached during this year 
which will end in a few days. 
  A Gulf agreement to unify customs fees on foreign imports 
has, according to a statement by Dr. al-Quwayz, faced the 
following disagreements of viewpoints: 
  "1. Some states believe that unifying the customs tariff by 
raising it above the reduced tariff levels they apply currently 
will negatively affect their reexport trade, which occupies big 
place in their economic activity. 
  "2. Other states believe that unifying the customs tariff at 
levels below the levels they apply currently will reduce their 
revenues and will affect their budgets negatively, unless this 
unification is coupled with a rewarding compensation for these 
states. 
  "3. A third group of states believe that reducing customs 
fees below a certain level will, in addition to reducing general 
treasury revenues, affect negatively the GCC states' negotiating 
power vis-a-vis their main trade partners. Such a reduction will 
also lead to unequal competition between national products and 
foreign products, thus reducing the GCC states' chances of real 
industrial growth at a time when these states seek to diversify 
their income sources." 
  Therefore, the economic papers submitted to the summit 
include a request from the GCC states' finance ministers to 
their leaders to give them more time to complete consultations 
on unifying the customs tariff. These papers also include 
another request for approval of the recommendations to improve 
the rules governing real estate ownership by Gulf states' 
citizens and recommendations to permit Gulf airlines to operate, 
to market services, and to make sales without the need for a 
local agent or a general guarantor. The papers further include a 
request to approve establishing a trade arbitration center for 
the GCC states in Bahrain and to pass its constitution. 
  It is indubitable that the failure to reach agreement on a 
unified customs tariff will delay the GCC states' objective of 
creating a common Gulf market to bolster the economic unity of 
the six Gulf states. This issue has been submitted constantly to 
all the Gulf summits since the first summit was convened in Abu 
Dhabi in 1981.
