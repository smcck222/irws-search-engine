  [Text] Sanaa, Jan 7 (AFP)--The Yemeni authorities on Friday 
asked tribal leaders to use their influence to win the release 
of four Yemenis, a Canadian and a Briton working for the US Hunt 
Oil firm, political sources here said. 
  A group from the Khawlan tribe kidnapped the six on Tuesday 
in the Ma'rib region 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of here and 
are demanding the release of one of their own men in exchange, 
Hunt engineers said. 
  Earlier reports said the kidnappers were from the Daham 
tribe. 
  Political sources here said the government was in contact 
with several tribal leaders in a bid to persuade the kidnappers 
to free the six, a helicopter pilot and five engineers. 
  They were kidnapped after flying to the Ma'rib area to 
inspect a leak at a pumping station, Hunt engineers said, adding 
that the helicopter was also seized. 
  The Yemeni Socialist Party's AL-THAWRI newspaper reported 
that the oil workers were trying to defuse a bomb planted by the 
Khawlan on one of the company's pipelines. Hunt Oil did not 
confirm that report. 
  Company engineers told AFP that the kidnappers wanted the 
authorities to free a tribesman who has been held for several 
weeks by Yemeni authorities in exchange for the six. 
  Daham tribesmen kidnapped an American diplomat, Haynes 
Mahoney, in November and held him for a week. It also held two 
American engineers from Hunt Oil for five days last May. 
  The Daham and Khawlan are part of the Bakil tribal group, 
which is generally loyal to Yemeni President 'Ali Abdallah 
Salih. But the Khawlan are known to support Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid's Socialist party. 
  The two leaders, the first from the north and the second 
from 
the south, have been split since August over how to run the 
affairs of Yemen, united in May 1990 after three hundred years 
of separation. 
  Several other foreigners have been abducted in recent months 
by tribes trying to exert pressure on the government, which is 
struggling to cope with serious economic and political problems. 
  Ma'rib, where the six men are believed to be held, is a 
mountainous region with some peaks as high as 2,000 meters. It 
is controlled by the heavily armed Bakil, who have for long 
encroached on the central government's authority.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, arrived in Ta'izz last 
night in response to the call and initiative of their eminences 
the ulema to meet with his brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice 
chairman of the Presidential Council, at the al-Janad Mosque 
today, Sunday, 27 Rajab 1414 Hegira, the anniversary of Prophet 
Muhammad's ascension to heaven. 
  In a statement to the Yemeni news agency, SABA', the brother 
chairman said that he hopes his meeting with his brother 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, which coincides with a religious occasion honored 
by the masses of our people and Islamic nation, namely, the 
anniversary of the Prophet Muhammad's ascension to heaven, will 
be an opportunity to find effective solutions to the current 
political crisis. He noted that our people have suffered, and 
continue to suffer, greatly as a result of this crisis which has 
had negative repercussions on the overall situation in the 
country and on citizens' living conditions in particular. He 
expressed the wish that this will be the last crisis in the 
history of the homeland. 
  He expressed great appreciation for the nationalist 
initiative of their eminences the ulema, an initiative that 
reflects their eagerness to perform their religious and national 
duty and to exert good offices to enable our homeland to 
overcome the difficult situation caused by the political crisis 
and the challenges that it has posed to the march of unity and 
democracy. 
  The brother chairman also praised the results of the 
meetings 
of the committee for dialogue among political forces as part of 
the efforts to overcome the crisis and firmly establish the 
pillars of the modern Yemeni state, the state of order, law, and 
constitutional institutions. 
  The brother chairman is accompanied by a number of 
officials. 
  Meanwhile, senior Yemeni ulema from various Yemeni 
governorates began to arrive at the Ma'adh Bin-Jabal Mosque in 
the al-Janad area in the Ta'izz Governorate to attend the grand 
gathering of the Yemeni ulema scheduled to begin today, Sunday, 
as part of the ulema's continued efforts to tackle the current 
political crisis. At the end of their meeting in Sanaa late last 
month, the ulema called for a meeting between brothers 
Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Presidential Council 
chairman, and 'Ali Salim al- Bid, Presidential Council vice 
chairman, as a beginning to resolve the crisis and strengthen 
Yemen's unity.

  [Text] Sources from the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] say 
that the party's secretary general and Yemeni Vice President, 
'Ali Salim al-Bid, has refused to leave for Ta'izz to meet with 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. Salih arrived in Ta'izz last 
night for a meeting with al-Bid which he described as a meeting 
of reconciliation. 
  The sources, who preferred anonymity, said that al-Bid's 
attendance will depend on the implementation of the 18 points 
that the YSP presented as solutions and practical ways out of 
the current crisis and which the Salih-led General People's 
Congress party accepted unreservedly. 
  The Ta'izz meeting between the two men had been prepared by 
the Yemeni Ulema Association. Several hours before it was 
scheduled to begin today a machine-gun attack was mounted on 
al-Bid's house in Aden. 
  The Yemeni police who caught the assailant are interrogating 
him to reveal the motives for his attack. It is not known if 
al-Bid was at home when the attack occurred. 
  It is worth mentioning that al-Bids has refused to leave 
Aden 
for the past five months and is demanding deep-rooted reforms in 
Yemen as a condition for traveling to Sanaa.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, today performed the noon prayer 
with their eminence the 'ulema in the historic al-Janad Mosque 
in Ta'izz. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman attended part of 
their eminence the 'ulema's meeting in al-Janad. He delivered a 
speech in which he said: I am pleased to attend this meeting, 
which encompasses a group of their eminence the 'ulema, in 
response to the invitation you extended to me and to brother 
'Ali Salim al-Bid to meet on this great day, which is dear to 
our hearts and in which the Muslim world celebrates a glorious 
Muslim occasion [Prophet Muhammad's night journey from Mecca to 
Jerusalem], in this historic mosque that was built by a virtuous 
follower of the prophet, Mu'adh Bin-Jabal. This was the first 
mosque to be built in Yemen and on this pure soil. 
  He added: How I wished that brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid was 
here in order to work together to preserve the great achievement 
of unity that reunited the Yemeni family after its estrangement 
and ended from our people's nightmare of division. We come here 
to protect our homeland against threats and challenges, and 
spare our people from the seditions hatched by those who do not 
wish them good, security, and stability. Our responsibility 
toward God and our people dictates that we should rise above 
trivial matters, selfish interests, and give priority to the 
supreme national interest. 
  The Presidential Council chairman added: Because of the 
crisis, our people have for several months now been putting up 
with many problems and difficulties, which inflicted serious 
harm on them and caused major cracks in the ranks of the Yemeni 
family. They also had an impact on the national economy and 
spread fears and concern among all of our people--the old, 
women, men, and children. 
  He added: Unity was achieved on 22 May 1990 through 
peaceful, democratic dialogue and respect for opinions and 
opposing opinions. We must abide by this principle, and not any 
other alternative, in order to spare our country any dangerous 
slips. You, the Yemeni 'ulema are meeting here after you have 
come from various parts of Yemen in order to fulfill a national 
and religious duty to unify ranks and stands, champion national 
unity, protect Yemeni unity, and spare our country all risks. 
  The Presidential Council chairman added: You have a 
responsibility to say what is right and to stand against evil 
and those who fabricate seditions, ignite them, and benefit from 
their continuation; and against those who advocate division, 
secession, and breaking the national ranks. This is your 
national and religious duty, which you have to fulfill to please 
God and your conscience and people. 
  The brother president said: Unity is a great action and a 
religious duty. It deserves that we sacrifice all that is dear 
and beloved to us to protect and nurture it. Unity was achieved 
to stay and to become further entrenched in the heart and 
conscience of every Yemeni. It will not be relinquished no 
matter the cost. 
  The president said that he has agreed to all the points and 
demands that the brothers in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
put forth, as well as to the initiatives submitted during the 
various gatherings to safeguard unity and to spare the homeland 
any perils or challenges that endanger the march of its unity 
and its democratic course. 
  The brother president said: We made concessions for the sake 
of Yemen and for the sake of the present and future of Yemeni 
generations, which depends on the entrenchment of unity that is 
protected by democracy. This is why we came here to unite our 
stands and resort to dialogue, reason, and logic and to search 
for effective means that will safeguard our national unity. 
National duty dictates that all of us must safeguard the great 
achievement, not to fall prey to our whims and private 
interests, and to reach understanding and not fight one another. 
We should also deprive those who sow sedition in our society of 
any opportunity for the shedding of Yemeni blood. We seek peace 
and stability for our homeland and tranquility for our society. 
  The president referred to the practices that harm the 
homeland's unity and its democratic course, which certain 
irresponsible writers and newspapers carry out. 
  The president said: On the personal level, we suffered 
greatly from these misdeeds, which violate all laws, norms, and 
ethics. We put up with them for the sake of unity and to 
entrench the democratic march in our country. However, some 
regrettably understand democracy to be slander and harm against 
others. They practice democracy in a flawed manner. 
  The brother president emphasized that democracy represents 
responsible behavior and constructive criticism to carry out 
reforms and reach better things. The brother president pointed 
out the impact the crisis has had on the daily life of our 
people and the difficulties and great tribulation it had brought 
about. He reaffirmed the need to expeditiously emerge from this 
difficult situation in a responsible manner so that all will 
devote their efforts to constructive and useful work. He 
appealed to their eminence, the 'ulema to guide the sons of the 
people to the path of right and good and to what will enhance 
national unity and safeguard the homeland's unity, and to always 
be advocates of right and soldiers of justice and right, fearing 
no one but God. 
  The meeting was attended by brother Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zindani, member of the Presidential council; Field Marshal 
'Abdallah al-Sallal; Qadi Muhammad Isma'il' al-Hajji, chief of 
the Higher Court and head of the Yemeni 'Ulema Society; and 
other officials.

  [Text] In its meeting this evening in the economic and 
commercial capital, Aden, the Political Forces Dialogue 
Committee [PFDC] began discussing the second topic on its

the paper presented by various parties on the principles for 
building the state in order to work out a paper on the subject 
and to present it to the PFDC at its forthcoming meeting. 
  The PFDC continued discussing the ideas presented by the 
dialogue's parties, and through serious and responsible dialogue 
and through sincere interaction the committee made decisive 
decisions on the first point on its agenda, and approved a 
number of procedures. 
  Concerning the media; television, radio, and newspapers; the 
committee decided that no statements relating to officials which 
speak about any political party or hint about a charge against a 
party, parties, or individuals should be broadcast or published. 
The media should refrain from becoming involved in issues that 
fuel the crisis. 
  The committee called for expanding interviews and programs 
on 
the decisions on which the dialogue parties agree, and 
emphasizing the programs, interviews, and seminars that call for 
unity and integration of the national front, and which call for 
rapprochement between political groups in the country. It 
called for rejecting the statements, interviews, and speeches 
from any party that condemn any party or individual in the 
government with the aim of escalating the crisis and obstructing 
the dialogue. It calls for refraining from leaking news to 
foreign media on the crisis and for refraining from leaking 
anything that fuels the crisis, escalates differences, harms the 
national unity and thy unity of the internal front. 
  The committee decided that the officials should not make any 
statements on the crisis in the country, and warned any Yemeni 
correspondent or reporter for foreign media against publishing 
false and fabricated news on the crisis and the dialogue. 
  As for those accused of security violations, the PFDC 
emphasized that decisive measures should be taken to arrest 
fleeing suspects involved in assassinations, assassination 
attempts, highway robberies, and other cases of security 
violations, and to immediately begin trying those arrested in 
sabotage actions in legal and open trials. 
  The committee says anyone who provides shelter to a suspect 
wanted by security organs, or anyone who hides a jail breaker 
will be considered a violator of the law, and legal actions will 
be taken against him. 
  The PFDC stressed the need to expeditiously issue a law on 
bearing arms, implement it, and review the current law to make 
it more strict to limit bearing arms and to curb their use and 
trading in them. Investigations should continue to locate camps 
or areas used to train people to commit violent acts and to take 
the appropriate measures in this regard. 
  Regarding the security and military aspect, the PFDC decided 
to remove all checkpoints inside and outside the cities 
regardless of whether they are affiliated with the Defense 
Ministry, the Interior Ministry, or both ministries. 
  The PFDC called for holding general reconciliation to stop 
the bloodshed of the Yemenis. In accordance with this 
reconciliation, no revenge will be taken, and anyone who takes 
revenge will be considered an outlaw. The competent state 
organs will be responsible for taking tough legal measures 
against those outlaws. The PFDC decided to move the units from 
the outskirts of some areas in the governorates of Ta'izz, Lahj, 
Ibb, Abyan, Shabwah, al-Bayda', and Ma'rib and to redeploy them 
in areas agreed upon by an Armed Forces technical committee. 
The Defense Ministry will take measures to implement this and a 
decree to this effect will be issued within one week with 
implementation to begin immediately afterward. 
  The PFDC decided that no military patrols should move in 
cities or on roads. Police will be responsible for patrols in 
accordance with security requirements. 
  The PFDC decided to withdraw the Armed Forces from the 
cities 
and to redeploy them within a period that does not exceed two 
months in accordance with a central, scientific, and united plan 
that prepares for their merger, organization, and straightening 
out their affairs provided that their merger will not take more 
than four months following the withdrawal from cities. The 
military police's role will be confined to the security and 
discipline of the military units. The military police are not 
allowed to carry out activities or patrolling that conflict with 
the authority of the public security. The Armed Forces 
commanders and soldiers are also prevented from intervening in 
the affairs of the government authorities, the local issues of 
citizens, or the governorates affairs. They are also prevented 
from carrying out any activity in their working areas that 
conflict with the duties of the judicial, executive, or 
political authorities. There will be no recruitment, arming, or 
mobilization of any units, militias, border guards, popular 
guards, or any similar groups and the formation of any new 
groups shall be canceled. The PFDC decided to void all illegal 
promotions that have been awarded since the beginning of 1993.

  [Text] During this evening's meeting in Aden, the economic 
and commercial capital, the political forces' dialogue committee 
examined a draft document on the bases of building the modern 
Yemeni state as presented by the subcommittee stemming from the 
dialogue committee. The conferees discussed the document and 
enriched it with their opinions and observations. They stressed 
the importance of drawing up the basic principles for the 
attainment of a modern Yemeni state and specifying its central 
and local bodies, considering these principles a strong basis 
for the reformation of the political, economic, and social 
situation in a manner that will safeguard the state of unity and 
reinforce the democratic process. They stressed that building 
the state on strong foundations will allow for movement toward 
the national objectives in the fields of social and economic 
construction, development, and growth. 
  The dialogue committee is still discussing the bases plan as 
a prelude to endorsing it after introducing some amendments. 
The political forces' dialogue committee began its meeting this 
morning at the Executive Bureau hall in Aden by discussing a 
plan on the bases of building the state. It also reviewed the 
efforts being exerted to follow up the implementation of the 
dialogue committee decisions on ending the deterioration and the 
extent to which the decisions are being abided by by the 
concerned parties. It regretted that some parties have failed 
to abide by what was decided on in order to stop the 
deterioration. The importance of expediting the tasks assigned 
to the committee and overcoming all obstacles has been 
emphasized in order to reach suitable solutions to the crisis. 
The bases of building the state are some of the most important 
issues of discussion as they define the future picture in a 
manner that fulfills our Yemeni people's aspiration for 
security, stability, development, and prosperity.

Presidential Council and secretary general of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party, and Mr. Salim Salih Muhammad, the member of the 
Presidential Council and assistant secretary of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party, published a statement about the message of the 
Presidential Council to Mr. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the prime 
minister, and the ministers. 
  The statement said that the message which was sent in the 
name of the Presidential Council is an open and desperate 
attempt to distort the nature of the political and economic 
crisis in the country, and an attempt to look for a scapegoat 
with the purpose of canceling the real causes of the 
deterioration of the political, economic, and security 
situation. Its purpose is also to divert attention from those 
who are behind the misuse the [word indistinct] of the state 
funds, the devaluation of the local currency, and the wave of 
terrorism. 
  The statement said that the message which was issued by some 
members of the Presidential Council took place at the time when 
the national dialogue commission is holding its meetings, and is 
about to complete its work and come out with a general agreement 
to find a solution to the political crisis. 
  Mr. 'Ali Salim al-Bid and Mr. Salim Salih Muhammad affirmed 
that they are not responsible for the practices, and are putting 
responsibility on those who seek to escalate the situation.

  [Text] Sanaa, Jan 8 (AFP)--Unidentified gunmen shot and 
killed an official of the Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) here, 
party officials announced Saturday. 
  'Abd-al-Karim Salih al-Jihmi was the second YSP official to 
be killed in 10 days and the 152nd party member to fall victim 
to gunmen since North and South Yemen merged in May 1990. 
  Party officials said three gunmen fired several shots at 
al-Jihmi late Friday when he drew up in his car before his home 
in the Bi'r 'Ubayd district in east Sanaa. 
  The killing comes as a committee seeking to reconcile

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement by YSP Political Bureau at end of its </F>
meetings in Aden 6-7 January -- read by announcer] 
  [Summary From Poor Reception] "The Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] Political Bureau held its regular meeting in Aden under 
brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the YSP Central Committee secretary 
general and vice chairman of the Presidential Council, 6-7 
January [words indistinct]." The Political Bureau considered 
the developments that have taken place in the country and 
discussed ways to settle the current crisis. The Political 
Bureau highly praised the efforts to render national dialogue a 
success. "The Political Bureau discussed the manifestations of 
the continued series of assassinations [words indistinct] and 
the other national forces [words indistinct] the assassination 
of struggler [words indistinct] in al-Bayda' governorate on 6 
January 1994 in Sanaa, and the continued military mobilization 
actions and the harassments [word indistinct]. The Political 
Bureau noted that these practices are viewed as a serious 
exacerbation of the crisis and are a sign on the increasing role 
of the quarters and parties that wager on aborting national 
dialogue [words indistinct] push the homeland towards the brink 
of a catastrophe and [word indistinct] destructive civil war 
that will destroy everything and from which only the enemies of 
the people will benefit." 
  "The Political Bureau has warned against threats posed by 
the trend attempting to use the agencies of the united state as 
a cover to execute the scheme of division, kill democracy," and 
"destroy the homeland's unity." 
  "The Political Bureau stresses that these actions will 
exacerbate the crisis, completely conflict with the results and 
guidelines reached by the national dialogue committee, and place 
obstacles in the face of any objective solutions to the current 
crisis." 
  The Political Bureau also warns against deteriorating 
economic conditions and a drop in the citizens' standard living 
conditions. It also warns against the growing political crisis 
and deteriorating security conditions. 
  The Political Bureau also notes that there are "fabricated 
factors and reasons that are accelerating economic collapse." 
These include smuggling, currency forfeiting, speculation in 
currency, mishandling of public funds, and the drop in the value 
of the national currency. The Political Bureau stressed the 
need for finding quick solutions to the economic conditions. 
  "The Political Bureau concludes that the current crisis is a 
comprehensive one with political, economic, social, and [word 
indistinct] dimensions and requires quick, comprehensive, 
objective, and responsible solutions." 
  "The Political Bureau notes that the only serious solutions 
to the current crisis lie in preserving unity," and the building 
of a "democratic, modern, and united state based on a 
decentralized, democratic system of local government." Such 
solutions would ensure a higher degree of "political 
participation by all citizens of the homeland;" help achieve 
"economic, cultural, and social progress;" and "strengthen 
unity, and end all manifestations and consequences of division." 
  The Political Bureau stresses the need to give particular 
attention to the "issues related to the people's security, 
freedom, living conditions, and progress." 
  Finally, the Political Bureau urges "all political forces, 
parties, and organizations and the masses to display further 
awareness, cohesion, and unity." It also urges them to silence 
the "drums of war," prevent the "conspiracies of partition and 
division" and to preserve "unity and democracy."

  [Text] The House of Representatives' committee assigned the 
task of finding the facts pertaining to the current political 
crisis held a meeting under Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn 
al-Ahmar this evening. House Speakership member brother 
Muhammad al-Khadim al-Wajih attended. 
  At the outset of the meeting, the house speaker noted that 
the House of Representatives, through its sessions and also 
through the follow-up committee it has formed to find the facts 
pertaining to the crisis, will continue to play its effective 
national role to resolve the crisis, given the fact that the 
House of Representatives is the legislative authority elected by 
the people. He added: Moreover, it is this house that began the 
efforts to address the crisis when it issued its statement on 
the crisis on 5 November 1993 and formed a fact-finding 
committee from among its members. 
  The brother house speaker went on to say that the task of 
addressing the crisis must remain, first and foremost, within 
the confines of the Presidential Council, the House of 
Representatives, the Council of Ministers, and the coalition 
government committees. 
  The house speaker said: The people who elected us asked us 
to keep the trust, the significance of which was accentuated 
when the house members took the oath during its first session. 
Hence, the house will remain alive. It will continue to hold 
its sessions, given the fact that it is the representative of 
the people, an elected body, and the legitimate constitutional 
authority, which is the guardian of the constitution, 
legitimacy, law and order, and which oversees all executive 
organizations. 
  Afterward, the committee examined various developments and 
repercussions of the crisis. The debates of the conferees 
during this session underlined the need to remove the effects of 
the crisis by resolving the problem of price hikes, halting the 
decline in the exchange rate of the national currency, promoting 
security and stability, improving the living conditions of the 
people, safeguarding Yemeni unity, and consecrating national 
unity. The conferees also reaffirmed the need to continue 
efforts to reach drastic solutions to the crisis democratically 
and objectively, within the constitutional and legitimate 
frameworks, and in a manner that will rid the homeland and 
people of the ordeal, as well as the economic difficulties 
created by the crisis. The endeavor to defuse the crisis, the 
conferees noted, must also ensure the strength and entrenchment 
of united Yemen, as well as the creation of a democratic, 
shura-inspired, civilized, and modern community.

  [Text] The House of Representatives this morning held an 
ordinary session under speaker brother Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. 
  First, the House reviewed the minutes of its last session, 
and approved them after correcting some paragraphs. Then, it 
listened to a letter addressed to the brother speaker from the 
brother prime minister. The letter contains an apology for the 
government's failure to report to the House this morning, 
Monday, 10 January 1994, corresponding to 28 Rajab 1414 Hegira, 
as it should have done according to a House decision approved in 
a session held on Wednesday, 5 January 1994. According to the 
letter, the brother prime minister is currently indisposed. 
  Following a detailed discussion of the letter sent by Prime 
Minister brother Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the House 
accepted this excuse, with the understanding that the House can 
still summon the government and that a new date will be set by 
the House to hold a general debate on the government's policy 
statement and the House's statement on it in an attempt to learn 
the extent and level of implementation of what was mentioned in 
the policy statement. 
  The House also issued the following decisions: 
  1. The brother prime minister, deputy prime ministers, and 
all cabinet members can dedicate their time to their missions, 
powers, and specialities which are constitutionally and legally 
determined. However, they should not engage in the political 
forces' dialogue committee at the expense of their 
responsibilities and executive work. This is because such 
engagement will obstruct the interests of both the public and 
the state's official institutions. 
  2. The House endorsed the government's order to all the 
officials and employees of the state's administrative bodies, 
institutions, and organs to proceed with their own tasks, 
according to one's field of specialization and work. It also 
endorsed the principle of awards and punishments in this regard 
without leniency or favoritism. 
  3. The government needs to subsidize the following basic 
food commodities: Wheat, rice, flour, and oils, including 
edible fat, as well as sugar, children's milk, and medicines. 
The official prices should be shown on these commodities 
through Yemen. Moreover, there should be supervision of prices 
to know the extent of abidance by the official prices which are 
set by the state, represented by the Ministry of Supply and 
Trade. Legal measures have to be taken against those who 
violate the official price list for these commodities which are 
necessary for the living of the public. 
  The House will resume work tomorrow, Tuesday, morning, God 
willing.

  [Text] Sanaa, 10 Jan (INA)--Informed Yemeni sources have 
said that opinions in Sanaa are moving in the direction of 
forming a new government in the coming phase. Such a government 
would represent the political parties and forces as part of an 
approach to resolve the political crisis. 
  The weekly AL-HIWAR cites these sources as saying that the 
new government will be entrusted with implementing the political 
agreement which the coalition and opposition parties are 
drafting to end Yemen's political crisis, tackle the country's 
problems, work out development programs, and promote the unity 
of the state. 
  Observers here believe that the agreement's articles will 
ensure the bases for merging the two armies, end the military 
manifestations throughout the country, entrench security, and 
crystallize sound national action in the field of news media, 
economy, and politics.

establishment of the Iraqi Army. His excellency added: You 
must not commit historic mistakes. Everything can be amended, 
except history. 
  On this occasion, President Saddam Husayn addressed 
fighters: 
the Americans are always deluded. They were deluded during 
their 30-state aggression, they were deluded in Somalia, and 
will be deluded again. This is because not only will the 
evil-minded suffer the consequences of his evil deeds, but also 
the conceited one. If such an individual is both evil-minded 
and conceited, he will inevitably suffer the consequences. 
  His excellency said: Our plans were to be in the southern 
region of Iraq and to lure the enemy troops into urban Iraqi 
areas and cities so that we could put them through the worst. 
However, what happened was that the enemy did not enter our 
territory. Besides, some people did not give themselves and 
their people the chance to play this role. It is true that the 
enemy did not enter Iraq as we had planned for it, but a clash 
was possible. In such a case, it would have been possible to 
drag the enemy into the death traps that we had planned for it. 
At that time, the Iranians did their known misdeed, and the 
evil ones rallied around the treacherous Iranian act. 
Consequently, fires broke out in most areas in Iraq. 
  His excellency said: The United States announced a 
unilateral cease-fire. I am saying the United States because it 
is actually the party that assembled the evil gathering along 
with its evil supporters, who bear Arab nationalities. It is 
the party that created that momentous evil gathering with its 
known intentions to commit its misdeed. 
  President Saddam Husayn said: At that time, I recall, they 
said that we should confirm the cease-fire, which they announced 
unconditionally and unilaterally, except for self-defense if 
they were attacked by the Iraqis. We said: Okay, let us do 
that. They said: Send your envoys to a U.S. ship, the name of 
which I cannot remember. It was anchored in the Arabian Gulf. 
  His excellency went on: These contacts were between 
diplomats. The idea was to spare military personnel the hassle 
of dealing with these details, in order to free them for their 
goals. The Foreign Ministry sent me a memorandum to the effect 
that the Americans asked the then Soviets, or rather ordered the 
then Soviets, to tell us through their foreign minister that the 
Americans want Iraqi military personnel who represented the 
Iraqi side against 28 armies to report to such-and-such a vessel 
in the Gulf. They used such language as to show that they were 
not making a suggestion to an equal but sending us a summons. I 
believe they specified the position of the ship. The Americans 
said they would arrange for our military personnel's transport 
to the ship. Here I want to remind them of a historic error, 
which they ought to have not made. 
  His excellency added: At that time, through which all of you 
lived, and, therefore, remember, the state of our domestic front 
was the most difficult. As for our external front, the 
situation was not that difficult. They were foreigners with 
whom we were engaged in battle. We were not too concerned about 
whether they had more weapons than we did. What really 
disturbed us was to see an overlap of ditches and confusion 
between people who call themselves Iraqis but take orders from 
foreigners and [words indistinct] in the pain we felt in our 
hearts. We were confronted with such a memorandum, I mean the 
American asking us to report to them, and the Americans always 
submit to illusions. 
  At that time, the Americans thought that an opportunity 
presented itself for them to make us commit a historic error. 
Just imagine Staff Lieutenant General Sultan Hashim Ahmad, 
operations assistant for the Army chief of staff, and Staff Lt. 
Gen. Salah 'Abbud, commander of the 3d Corps, who had the rank 
of major general then, and other military comrades and staff 
officers, appearing on American television screens... Imagine 
military footage showing your military comrades on their way to 
the American ship to conduct negotiations with the Americans. 
  For our part, we said the negotiations will not take place 
on 
an American ship. I said: You have to choose between two sites 
where the negotiations may be held -- either in the Safwan 
region at the (?al-Julaydah) Airport or at any other point along 
the Iraqi-Saudi border. In the end, they settled for one of the 
two places. 
  His excellency added: When they chose the place, it met with 
our approval. Staff Lt. Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad, along with 
Lt. Gen. Salah 'Abbud and other staff officers, went there. 
When they were about to go into the tent where the negotiations 
were to be held, they were surprised... 
  His excellency added: Let us pause here. Before Staff Lt. 
Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad went to meet with the enemies, we 
contacted him and told him: You are the victors. I told the 
messenger who carried the message: Give my greetings to Staff 
Lt. Gen. Sultan Hashim Ahmad and to all the comrades in the 
General Command. I think that Staff Gen. Husayn Rashid was the 
Army chief of staff and that 'Ali Hasan al-Majid was at the time 
engaged on the battlefield. Since there was no means to get in 
touch with you, I told the carrier of the message to tell our 
comrades that they are the victors. 
  President Saddam Husayn went on: I have laid emphasis on 
this aspect for psychological reasons. I know how they think, 
but I chose to emphasize this point in case they might think 
that victory was not theirs or that victory was not as it should 
have been. Of course, victory as one plans and wishes it to be 
is one thing, and victory in the historical sense, which I mean 
here, is another. It was a third world war. Iraq was on one 
side and the world, save what God wished, was on the other. 
When I say the world, I mean the political leaders and 
administrations. I do not mean the peoples, even those who were 
made to believe that they were fighting for a good cause. I 
told him to stress that Iraq was the victor, that the Army of 
Iraq achieved victory, and that our comrade leaders who will go 
now to negotiate with the enemy have achieved victory. They 
will see how the enemy will bow their heads down, if they have 
any shame left as military commanders. When the representatives 
of 28 armies, three of which are superpowers, do not feel their 
defeat when the representatives of one army sit with them at the 
same table, then those who still cherish some of the meanings of 
the military code -- which basically stress manliness and 
knighthood -- will be ashamed of themselves, even if they have 
no humanitarian traits left. Those people will feel that they 
are drowning in shame as they sit on those chairs to represent 
28 armies in the face of a single army. All these well-known 
countries, and others who were not probably revealed properly, 
stood in the face of one country, which is known in terms of its 
size, population, economy, industry, and agriculture. 
  He added: Staff Lieutenant General Sultan Hashim Ahmad, who 
is known, along with his comrades, for sound military conduct, 
went to meet them. It should have been very clear to the enemy 
that Staff Lt. Gen. Sultan and his comrades were the victors. 
When he and his comrades arrived at the door of the tent, he 
was surprised when they asked him to take off his weapon before 
entering the negotiating tent. He replied: I will not take off 
my weapon before the other party removes its weapon. Who will 
speak on behalf of the 28 armies? Schwarzkopf answered him in 
apparent confusion, as Staff Lt. Gen. Sultan told me: I 
represent them. He said: Then take off your weapon. And he 
did. The came the turn of Staff Lt. Gen. Salah 'Abbud, who 
asked who the second man was. He was told that the man was 
Sultan. But how great a difference is there between Sultan and 
Sultan. They meant Prince Khalid Bin-Sultan, since the West 
calls a person by the name of his father or his title. So this 
Sultan was the second person who represents the state of his 
majesty. He told them: Tell Khalid Bin-Sultan to throw his 
weapon away before the second man in the Iraqi delegation throws 
his weapon away. Schwarzkopf called Prince Khalid Bin-Sultan and 
asked his men to send quickly for him. Then Khalid Bin-Sultan 
came hurriedly, and Schwarzkopf asked him to take his weapon 
off, even though he is a prince. So he did. Afterward, Staff 
Lt. Gen. Salah 'Abbud entered without his weapon. 
  His excellency said: At that time, with its well-known 
atmosphere, I told them that the minutes of the meeting should 
be written down and officially signed, in addition to recording 
it on an audio tape. We are saying this in order that you pay 
attention to the details that may seem very trivial and may have 
no historical significance. We, however, did not forget to 
mention these details despite those circumstances. The comrades 
requested that the minutes of the meeting be recorded, and they 
received a copy of the recording. Speaking of this issue, I 
would like you to make 200 more copies, so there will not be a 
single copy. I do not know whether they wrote down official 
minutes or whether they were content with this recording. Of 
course, this is apart from the cease-fire minutes, which were 
also written down and signed. 
  President Saddam Husayn added: Suppose that we now show two 
pictures of our comrades while heading for the U.S. ship, 
assuming that the historic mistake was actually made. Some may 
say that there is no harm in heading for this ship. They may 
also wonder: Why do you want to complicate the issue of holding 
that meeting aboard a ship or elsewhere? We, however, say: 
Such an issue is greatly significant and may have an impact for 
hundreds of years, if not for thousands of years. If we now 
show your children two pictures on the television screen, one 
having our own description, and the other having the description 
the enemy wanted at the very beginning, what impact would each 
of the two pictures have on the people's psychological makeup? 
I believe that this is understood. 
  His excellency continued: Regrettably, among the painful 
matters in Arab politics is the fact that when an Arab ruler 
wants to resolve an issue, he asks the whole world to join him 
in signing a humiliating document. All right, you are in a weak 
position on a certain issue, and you decided to take a weak 
position. But you should let others be in a strong position as 
a guarantee for you if you later plan to retreat from this weak 
position and take a strong position, at which time you will find 
someone who will protect you, shelter you, back you, and 
understand you. Why does such a ruler want everyone to take the 
same position as his own position whenever he adopts a weak 
position? 
  President Saddam Husayn pointed out that [former Egyptian 
President] al-Sadat used to say: Normalize relations with 
Israel. However, would it not have been better for al-Sadat, in 
the first place, to await what would be really achieved before 
urging others to adopt his position? Wait, brother, and see 
what will happen, what results your conduct achieves, and see 
whether there is any Arab who has been convinced of normalizing 
relations. Wait, at least to see where this path will take you, 
and what result this conduct achieves. It is not important if 
others have a different opinion; what is really important is 
whether you actually want to burn your bridges. They used to 
say loudly: Normalize relations with Israel, adopt this 
specific position. 
  His excellency said: Some people just want an excuse to do 
what they want to do. They say that some people, whom they do 
not want to name, are moving very fast, running. But why do you 
run? Wait for some time to pass, wait for six months or a year. 
Are you so impatient that a period of a few months is too long 
for you? Responsible people should withstand pressure for 
several years for the sake of their cause. A responsible man 
should remain steadfast even if a dagger is lodged in his flesh. 
He must stand this pressure for five years while carrying out 
his duties, and must behave normally. Only after this can he 
remove the dagger. Why the hurry? They look as if they are 
awaiting the opportunity or are feeding on a single grain of 
wheat, as the saying goes. [sentence as received] 
  His excellency said: They talk too much when they discuss 
Arab nationalism. They talk so much that they make us sleepy. 
They talk too much about history but when it comes to action, 
they shrink to the point of nothingness, why? They can become 
great. If someone wants to become great in their principles we 
will all support and follow him even if the Iraqis blame us. 
All we want is for him to raise his standards a little. 
  Addressing the commanders, the president said: O comrades, 
make mistakes but may God lead you away from mistakes. Only God 
is free of errors. You cam make mistakes in anything but you 
must not make mistakes in history because anything can be 
corrected except history. If the ship's story materialized, 
would such a mistake be corrected? To correct this mistake 
would have required us to wage a second war with America so that 
we could bring them to negotiate with us on our own ship, 
otherwise the mistake of the first ship would not be forgotten 
but would remain so that each one of your children, when he goes 
to school with his pen and papers, would see this ship popping 
up between the lines. 
  His excellency said: If they made Sultan Hashim Ahmad lay 
down his gun without him making them lay down theirs too, his 
gun would remain on the face of all the Iraqis and the Americans 
would show it on every occasion in their films. The Americans 
have not produced any such films so far, why? Aren't they the 
movie makers? They have not produced any film for some time 
because they have nothing to show. Wherever they look they face 
basic problems. Would they show their guided bombs hitting a 
building to bring it down it or a factory to destroy? 
  President Saddam Husayn added: Thus, they could not show a 
single U.S. soldier facing an Iraqi soldier. They will not show 
this, nor will they show how the U.S. tanks faced the Iraqi 
tanks. Let them show the fighting against the Republican Guard 
in the south or the fighting that took place against the 
isolated heroes who fought them at Kuwait airport. A British 
commander appeared on the British television. He was fair when 
he said: If I were the commander of these fighters, I would be 
proud of them. 
  During the meeting, his excellency reviewed the 
international 
positions, the circumstances that Iraq experienced during the 
glorious Saddam's al-Qadisiyah battle and the Mother of Battles, 
and Iraq's rejection of dishonest bargaining. He also reviewed 
Iraq's adherence to the friendship with the rulers of the former 
Soviet Union, who betrayed this friendship in the Mother of 
Battles and harmed it greatly in the al-Qadisiyah battle. 
  His excellency recalled Iraq's rejection of the continued 
U.S. attempts to acquire the Soviet T-72 tank in return for 
supplying us with a package of shells and cannons, which we 
would pay for. The aim was to dismantle and examine the Soviet 
tank, so they could see it from the inside and become acquainted 
with it. 
  President Saddam Husayn said: If we now go and sit with the 
Russians, who are the origin and base of the great [former] 
Soviet Union, we will not be ashamed because our positions can 
only raise the head of mankind high, knowing that those who are 
ruling Russia now are not the same as those who ruled the Soviet 
Union and who betrayed the friendship in the Mother of Battles. 
  Concluding his speech, President Saddam Husayn said: In 
order not to make mistakes in historical issues when we face 
them, we should pause and think several times. Everyone of us 
should be ready to offer sacrifices, and we all should cooperate 
in order not to commit a historic mistake. 
  Participating in the reception ceremony and in extending the 
congratulations were fighter Staff General 'Izzat Ibrahim, 
deputy commander in chief of the Armed Forces; fighter Staff 
General 'Ali Hasan al-Majid, defense minister; Hatim Hamdan 
al-'Azzawi, head of the Presidential Office; fighter Staff 
Lieutenant General Husayn Kamil Hasan, industry and minerals 
minister; and fighter Staff General 'Abd-al-Jabbar Shanshal, 
minister of state for military affairs.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi </F>
by Sana' al-Sa'id; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Sa'id] How can the Palestinians find a way out 
of their crisis after Israel's adherence to the Cairo document 
and its insistence that this document is a common denominator of 
understanding between the Palestinians and Israel? 
  [Qaddumi] We are not in crisis, but we have a difficult 
problem before us. Undoubtedly, continuing negotiations will 
get us out of that crisis as long as Israel insists on a literal 
translation of the Declaration of Principles agreed upon last 
September. 
  [Al-Sa'id] Do you believe Israel is lying when it claims 
that 
the agreement reached in the Cairo talks last week was a 
document of understanding between the two sides and not merely 
ideas presented to both sides? 
  [Qaddumi] Yes, it is lying. Israel is used to faking facts, 
and the world and the international community must understand 
this point. There was no document and no agreement. There were 
discussions and ideas were presented. Israel is playing games 
and denying everything that was agreed upon in the agreement. 
The agreement stipulates withdrawal as a major issue. Israel 
is stalling and wants to give away scattered pieces of territory 
here and there. It also wants to control the crossings. This 
is not withdrawal. If Israel's intentions are honest, it should 
adhere to the agreement; in other words, it needs to withdraw 
early on. 
  [Al-Sa'id] The faltering in the talks might threaten the 
negotiations. And isn't Israel blaming the PLO for not adhering 
to the Cairo agreement? 
  [Qaddumi] No agreement was reached in the first place for us 
to adhere to. Cairo merely discussed Israeli ideas that were 
proposed. In general, we realized we have difficult negotiations 
ahead when we started the peace process in Madrid. Israel is 
faking facts and claiming that this territory is disputed 
territory. We insisted that it should withdraw from these 
territories so that the Palestinian identity--the real identity 
of the territories--would be reinstated on condition that 
discussion of the thorny issues is postponed. 
  Withdrawal is the basic element in this agreement. If Israel 
does not withdraw, the whole agreement is threatened with 
collapse due to Israel's belligerence and nonadherence to the 
real texts of this agreement. Israel stalls and reads the facts 
backward. It has also gone back on the major principle that 
stipulates that the land is Palestinian, which means the 
Palestinian people's sovereignty over it is the core issue. The 
responsibility of the international community is a direct 
responsibility, especially as regards those who patronize the 
peace march, that is, President Clinton. 
  [Al-Sa'id] But Israel still clings to the crossings. 
  [Qaddumi] Israel's adherence to the crossings is contrary to 
the texts. It has no right to supervise who comes and goes, 
because this land it is discussing is Palestinian. Israel must 
adhere to the agreement of principles governing the transitional 
stage. Withdrawal does not give it the right to continue being 
responsible for the movement of people and goods in and out of 
the area from which it withdraws. 
  [Al-Sa'id] There are claims that Israel insists on 
controlling the crossings merely to meet Jordan's wishes; Jordan 
is said to prefer the crossings under Israeli control than under 
Palestinian control to guarantee their security. 
  [Qaddumi] In our political path, we have become accustomed 
to 
having politicians like Kissinger tell us one thing and the Arab 
countries another. These are the methods Israel is using in its 
negotiations. It says things that are different from the facts. 
It leaks these rumors to one Arab party or another. I do not 
believe that Jordan prefers to have Israel control the crossings 
over the Palestinians. I cannot even imagine that Jordan would 
publicize something like this. Jordan is part of the Arab 
territory, we are a part of the Arab territory, and our 
interests are the same. There is no difference between the 
Palestinian and Jordanian people. These are mere names giving an 
identity for political reasons. We should have no differences 
with Jordan no matter what we might hear every now and then. We 
have joint interests with Jordan. 
  [Al-Sa'id] We interpreted your late coordination with 
Jordan as reflecting your differences. 
  [Qaddumi] It has nothing to do with any dispute with Jordan. 
We are brothers. We tried right from the start to ensure an 
Israeli withdrawal so that we could sign and coordinate with 
Jordan on a clear-cut basis. 
  [Al-Sa'id] According to some people, the United States 
appears as if it has colluded with Israel to weaken the 
negotiating position with the Palestinians. 
  [Qaddumi] The United States knows its responsibilities. It 
is the principal sponsor of this process. The United States and 
President Clinton know that any failure of the process would 
mean the failure of U.S. policy. 
  [Al-Sa'id] The Geneva meeting slated to be held between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton could be a prelude for 
a thaw between Syria and Israel. Could this reflect negatively 
on the Palestinian track and find you lagging behind the other 
Arab tracks? 
  [Qaddumi] On the contrary. We believe this meeting would be 
in our interest. As Palestinians and Arabs, there must be 
progress on the Syrian track. The settlement must be just and 
comprehensive, not simply progress on the Palestinian track. We 
are doing our best to achieve progress on the Syrian, Lebanese, 
and Jordanian tracks. Syria shoulders great responsibilities and 
advocates a comprehensive solution. Syria must search for a 
comprehensive solution because it has responsibilities toward 
the other brothers. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What about the acts of violence and killings in 
the occupied Arab territories that Israel is using as a pretext 
to prove that the PLO can't maintain security and control the 
situation? 
  [Qaddumi] These acts are a result of Israel's terrorism 
inside the occupied territories. Israel is resorting to this to 
prove that security is absent and that the PLO can't cope with 
the security issues. 
  We must not be too good-hearted, because the road to hell is 
paved with good intentions. We must realize that while there is 
one Israeli soldier on our land the Palestinian people must 
resist. The opposition must continue as long as Israeli 
soldiers occupy the Palestinian land. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What about the PLO's democracy amid the current 
numerous differences? 
  [Qaddumi] We have democracy so it's natural to have 
differences. It is the right of every faction to express its 
opinion freely and frankly. We want positive and objective 
criticism for the sake of building something. Praise be to God, 
all the factions abide by this. They are criticizing particular 
positions but they are not killing people.

  [Text] Palestinian circles have revealed that 95 
Palestinian embassies are suffering financial crises and only 
small amounts of the funding they require are being transferred 
to them. The circles say that an unannounced decision by 
'Arafat stipulated that financial allocations for these 
embassies should be cut so that the funds can be invested in 
European banks and used for fighting internal battles with the 
opposition Palestinian factions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hanan 'Ashrawi by Ben Segenreich in Tel </F>
Aviv; date not given: "Against a Monolithic Authority"] 
  [Text] [Segenreich] Is your refusal to accept a public 
office meant as a criticism of PLO leader 'Arafat? 
  ['Ashrawi] It is not a matter of individuals. We have a 
leadership that has not lived in its own country, with its own 
people, with a system of accountability, of control, and 
critical commentary for a long time. It has to change from 
being a liberation movement to a governmental system. The 
working methods and thinking patterns of the past are no longer 
valid. An internal reform is necessary. 
  This transition will be very painful, and a number of 
mistakes have already been made. During the next phase we must 
ensure that the new government respects citizens' rights and is 
truly democratic, that we do not follow the example of many 
Third World countries wherein a monolithic authority puts 
itself, not the people, at the center. 
  [Segenreich] Is 'Arafat accumulating too many offices, too 
much power? 
  ['Ashrawi] Of course, the PLO leadership should be more open 
and more democratic. It should decentralize and enable 
co-determination on the basis of talents and capacities. The 
old decisionmaking process is no longer valid. We need 
efficiency, openness, and control. 
  Whether the PLO is capable of effecting this change remains 
to be seen. The real test will come after the introduction of 
self-rule. 
  [Segenreich] A group of Palestinian businessmen and a 
delegation led by Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi recently presented 
suggestions for reforms in Tunis. Do you support this pressure 
on 'Arafat? 
  ['Ashrawi] I support the principle. Some time ago, a group 
of Palestinians from the occupied territories -- mainly 
delegates to the negotiations -- went to Tunis and worked out 
suggestions and structures there, such as criteria for 
appointing people to public offices. These suggestions were 
presented to 'Arafat; he agreed to them -- but, unfortunately 
they have not been put into practice. 
  [Segenreich] Should the key positions be given to people 
from among the PLO leadership in Tunis, or to local leaders? 
  ['Ashrawi] There should be a good mix. The people who have 
permanently lived in a coherent Palestinian society should get 
an effective say. They are entitled to this because they have 
worked here under the most difficult circumstances and have 
gained the people's confidence. No group should exert power at 
the cost of another. 
  [Segenreich] Is it right that just before Palestinian 
autonomy should come into effect there have been little 
preparations, and there is almost a state of chaos? 
  ['Ashrawi] This is an exaggeration. There is no chaos, but 
we are not all that well-prepared, either. Some administrative 
authorities and economic institutions are already in existence, 
but they are not prepared to such an extent that we could take 
over business tomorrow. It will be a difficult process, we will 
have to grow into the job. 
  We will have to make use of the technical knowledge of those 
who worked in the Israeli military administration, we will also 
have to use the enormous human resources of Palestinians all 
over the world and use their talents in establishing our nation, 
without any nepotism. 
  [Segenreich] What do you think the schedule will be for 
introducing autonomy? Some people say that the necessary time 
should be spent over this, since a good agreement is more 
important than a good schedule. 
  ['Ashrawi] A flexible schedule would be very dangerous. The 
withdrawal of Israeli troops should be concluded by 13 April, 
even if it is begun with a delay. And the elections have to be 
held before 13 July. This is the test of both sides' 
credibility and of the real democratic nature of the new regime.

  [Text] Shots were fired in the early evening yesterday at 
an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] outpost in Rafah's Tall Sultan 
neighborhood, but did not cause either casualties or damage. 
The soldiers returned fire. 
  The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine took 
responsibility for the attempted attack and claimed that several 
soldiers were wounded. But, to repeat, there were no casualties. 
  A Fatah Hawks leaflet disseminated yesterday in the Gaza 
Strip called for an end to use of arms when nonessential. The 
leaflet threatened to confiscate the weapons and punish the 
perpetrators. 
  The cases referred to are shots fired during festivities and 
taking money from residents under threat of arms while 
pretending to belong to Fatah or other organizations. During 
festivities marking Fatah's establishment 10 days ago wanted men 
and residents fired in the air out of happiness. At least five 
armed terrorists were later arrested and all were freed after 
senior IDF [Israel Defense Forces] officers intervened. 
  Arab sources note that groups of criminals are roaming 
around 
pretending to be wanted men and are demanding "taxes" from 
shopkeepers and wealthy people in the Strip. In some cases, 
wanted men are also making a living that way.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi on interview with Ibrahim </F>
Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, in Damascus; date not 
given] 
  [Text] Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for the 
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), has stressed that the 
initiative made toward Israel before the end of last year by the 
"'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions," the movement's military 
wing, is "genuine and reflects our self-confidence." However, 
he pointed out that Hamas is not presenting itself as an 
alternative to anyone. "Those are delusions." 
  While he pointed out that this year will be a "year of war, 
not peace," Ghawshah expressed Hamas' willingness to engage in a 
dialogue with all parties. But he excluded the Jews, because 
they are offering no "concessions" to the other side. 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH Ghawshah stressed that the 
statement made by the movement's guide, Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, on 
participation in the elections "cannot be corroborated." He 
pointed out that Hamas is committed to its position on 
participation in any legislative elections, except 
administrative self-rule elections, "on which our position has 
been decided." He revealed that the Syrian Government has 
offered some facilities to Hamas. He appealed to Arab 
governments and Iran to provide financial aid, "because their 
positions will be affected if we are hit." 
  In the interview conducted with him in Damascus Ghawshah 
said 
that Hamas' position on participation in the self-rule elections 
and the institutions arising from it "is clear, namely the 
complete refusal to take part in these elections at all." He 
pointed out that the statement on this question by the 
movement's guide, Shaykh Yasin, cannot be corroborated. 
"Nevertheless, he spoke about a legislative council for the 
Palestinian people -- which we are all demanding, but in 
isolation from any political plan." He added that "Hamas will 
participate in any elections that are not political. We have 
always participated in these elections and will continue to do 
so, because we do not want to abandon the movement's positions 
and the Islamic presence, which should be secured whenever 
possible." 
  On the movement's willingness to enter into a truce or 
dialogue with Israel, Hamas' official spokesman said that the 
"'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions'" initiative "was genuine and 
true, and it reflects self-confidence. This is attested by the 
fact that the Israelis considered it a humiliation for them." 
However, he pointed out that this initiative "does not indicate 
that we want to present ourselves as an alternative" to the PLO 
and its leader, Yasir 'Arafat. He said: "Those are delusions; 
we are not offering ourselves as an alternative to anyone." He 
stressed the movement's willingness to engage in a dialogue with 
all parties. "We consider ourselves in a state of war with the 
enemy. And when we make a move, we proceed from our Islamic 
principles. Our setting conditions for them (Israelis) is a 
continuation of the Islamic tradition in the relationship with 
the enemies." He pointed out that the important question in any 
proposal "is securing the Palestinian' interests without any 
concessions, and this initiative did contain all these meanings." 
  Asked whether Hamas is going to put forward other 
initiatives 
with conditions different from those set in the past, Ghawshah 
said that "truce in wars is a recognized thing, but it differs 
from the present capitulationist scheme (the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement). We are for a temporary tactical truce in which 
there is a gain for us." However, he said that a dialogue is 
possible with all, "except the Jews. We know their mentality, 
and no Jew can make concessions." 
  On the self-rule agreement and its future, Ghawshah said 
that "it is doomed to perish. Anyone who reads it will realize 
this." He added that "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions'" 
operations have brought to the surface "a very important 
question, namely the impossibility of coexistence with 
settlers." He pointed out that 'Arafat has suffered "a nervous 
breakdown." He said that the Palestinian people will rally 
around those opposed to the agreement and that "1994 will be a 
year of war and struggle, not peace." 
  Ghawshah denied that Hamas backtracked on its position when 
it agreed to form the leading committee of the "Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces" on the basis of two representatives for each 
organization. He said: "Our position was that, if we want to 
form a front to implement an ambitious political program, we 
must respect the influence of every faction. We also adhered to 
the foundation of our alliance, and our decision to agree to 
this formation (in the alliance program announced the day before 
yesterday) was less than the ambitious ceiling." Replying to 
the claims that Hamas is not strong outside [the occupied 
territories], he stressed that "if free elections are held in 
any areas in which the Palestinians are present, we will win 
them. The Islamic tendency is the common tendency, and we are 
not scared of any impartial elections." He pointed to the 
results of the parliamentary elections in Jordan and those of 
the Engineers Union elections, "in which we won 38 seats out of 
42." 
  He said that one of the reasons for Hamas' strength inside 
is 
"its reliance on the young generation -- which is a problem 
facing (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin. Every day we 
have a new, young, and secret leadership." 
  On the movement's financial sources, Ghawshah declined to 
name a specific quarter. He said: "We are pursuing a policy of 
austerity, relying on charity and donations from Arab states and 
Turkish, Arab, and Iranian businessmen, and a receipt is 
provided." He appealed for Arab financial aid, "but only 
provided it is not linked with political positions, because we 
receive decisions from our leadership only." He pointed out 
that this is what has made it difficult to "determine the 
authority making these decisions in Hamas, as 'Arafat has looked 
for this authority in Sudan, Jordan, and Iran." He added that 
he would not express any objection if Iran -- together with the 
Arab countries -- supports the movement materially and 
politically, "because we are working for their interests, and if 
we are hit, their positions will be affected." He pointed out 
that the Syrian leadership "is opening the door for us, and we 
are interested in Damascus' position, and they (the Syrians) see 
us as a strong tendency." 
  Ghawshah expected a "war to break out in the region if the 
bilateral negotiations within the peace process fail." He 
pointed to "an integration between the honorable operations" 
carried out by Hizballah from southern Lebanon and the military 
operations carried by the "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions" in 
the occupied territories, But "the political program is 
completely different between us and there is no coordination 
between the two sides." He said that the "Islamic Jihad" 
movement (led by Fathi al-Shiqaqi) is influenced by Iran "and 
the victories of the Iranian revolution." He pointed to 
"unionist plans" being conducted between Hamas and the Islamic 
Jihad.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "The United States Is Not Interested"] </F>
  [Text] The United States is the sole world superpower at 
present. This fact is bound to place grave responsibilities 
upon it, given the serious position it is occupying. Hence, it 
is peculiar for it to act just like small states, which are 
content with engaging themselves in tit for tat to avenge old 
enemies. What is currently taking place shows that the United 
States wants to enjoy its current position as the world's sole 
superpower without shouldering the responsibilities this 
entails. This has been manifested in what is taking place in 
Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Middle East. For the 
Clinton administration believes that the current PLO-Israeli 
negotiations are none of its business. What does this mean? 
Does such a position reflect a serious attitude? This 
indisputably reflects the abandonment of responsibilities toward 
the peace process, which supposedly continues to be sponsored by 
the United States. Moreover, it is the United States which 
continues to persistently enlist support for the Declaration of 
Principles signed between the PLO and Israel. The United States 
deemed this agreement the first diplomatic success of the 
current administration. What about the White House ceremony? 
What about the invitations extended for the first donor 
conference designed to secure pledges of aid for developing the 
territories sabotaged by the Israeli occupation? 
  It is impossible for Washington to see its role as that of a 
witness at a signing ceremony as if it were a protocol official. 
Likewise, no one would expect Washington to say that it has 
nothing to do with the implementation of the agreement, just 
because it was drafted in Oslo. It is to be recalled that it 
did nothing to deter those who called the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement the Washington agreement. Many of those who believed 
their eyes during the signing ceremony still call the agreement 
the Washington agreement. Does all this mean that the full 
partner's role is to be undertaken by Norway? This allegedly 
objective U.S. impartiality reflects a favorable response to 
Israeli wishes. It is not objective at all. It is true that 
Washington is still concerned with the other tracks of the 
negotiations. However, the experience of the past two years of 
negotiations has shown that Washington, at times, impeded, 
rather than aided the peace process. If the Arab negotiators 
are to speak frankly about this issue, they would say that the 
five rabbis, the U.S. Middle East peace talks coordinators, at 
times, wanted for Israel more than it wanted for itself. 
Indeed, the effort required to achieve this objective was not 
that difficult. This effort sought to preclude any coordination 
among the Arab negotiators. 
  The conclusion the Americans might have reached in the 
aftermath of the Oslo agreement is that the complex of the 
Israelis unilaterally handling the Palestinians has been, at 
last, resolved without their intervention, and without their 
having to provide any guarantees. This thinking cannot be 
classified as that of a superpower. It has to be recalled that 
all Arabs, be they supporters or opponents of the Oslo 
agreement, believe that Washington's role was brought under the 
limelight when the agreement was signed, and that this role 
cannot end at that. Although this agreement is flawed, nothing 
precludes efforts to rectify it. It is a mistake to attempt to 
address a major conflict involving peoples' rights and the 
sufferings of successive Arab generations with a mind-set that 
believes that the strong must emerge as the winner, because it 
had the skills required to seize the others' territory and 
rights. Such views should not be espoused by a superpower, for 
we are in the year 1994. What is more serious than Washington 
shirking its responsibilities toward the implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement is that international parties will 
follow in its footsteps. Consequently, the agreement will fail 
to enjoy international recognition. We have seen signs of this 
eventuality. Washington might have failed to see the negative 
impact of its position. No harm would be done if we remind it 
that the Arabs were expected to bear heavy burdens for peace. 
What then would be the consequences of sabotaging an agreement 
that was concluded out of despair in the first place? Has 
Washington thought of this, or is it not interested in this, 
either? It is hoped that the United States will pursue historic 
solutions on the remaining tracks, instead of seeking to force 
settlements and take advantage of adverse circumstances. For if 
it does, it, as a superpower, can then give its ally, Israel, a 
model to be emulated. That is, it can produce true peace. For, 
this is better than encouraging Israel to employ tricks that 
only befit war criminals.

  [Text] Jerusalem, Jan 11 (AFP)--A Palestinian construction 
group put forward Tuesday [11 January] "a giant national 
project" to build 13 towns on the West Bank and Gaza Strip at a 
cost of some 30 billion dollars over the next decade. 
  Three cities in Gaza would each house 250,000 people and 
another 10 developments on the West Bank a total of 500,000, 
said 'Isa 'Awdah, a director of the Philistia building firm. 
  "To erect a strong and durable economy we see that there is 
the need for a giant national project which can concentrate all 
the Palestinian forces ... [ellipsis as received] and constitute 
the backbone of this economy," he told a press conference. 
  'Awdah predicted the private sector plan would create 
150,000 
jobs. 
  More than 600,000 of the 780,000 Palestinians living in Gaza 
are considered refugees by the United Nations and 330,000 of 
them live in camps. 
  On the West Bank, nearly 480,000 of the 1.2 million 
Palestinians are refugees, 125,000 of them in UN-run camps. 
  'Awdah called on the Palestine Liberation Organisation, 
Israel and the international community to support the project, 
saying 40 percent of the financing would have to be foreign 
investment and cheap loans. 
  According to Hasan Abu-Libdah, in charge of the PLO's 
technical committee preparing for autonomy, the housing 
situation in the occupied territories is catastrophic. 
  An average of nine people live in each house or apartment on 
the Gaza Strip and 7.5 people in each unit on the West Bank. 
  Abu-Libdah estimated that 120,000 new units were needed each 
year to bring down the number to six people per house by the 
year 2000. 
  However, Ibrahim Sha'ban, head of the Palestinian Housing 
Council, hit out at the project. "This will reflect negatively 
on Palestinian credibility before donor countries," he said, 
calling for coordination. 
  The council is directing a 20-million-dollar European 
Community funded housing project in Gaza. 
  Philistia, based in Jerusalem, has 75 employees engaged 
mainly in construction projects in Israel.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the Taba talks, by Hasan Abu-Zayid in Taba on 10 
January, carried within the "With the Midday Events" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-Zayid] The talks between the Israeli and 
Palestinian sides resumed at Taba Hotel today. Members of the 
two delegations arrived at the meeting lounge at approximately 
1130. This meeting was preceded by a meeting between heads of 
the two delegations Dr. Nabil Sha'th and Major General Amnon 
Shahaq. The head of the Palestinian delegation reiterated that 
it is possible to resolve pending issues within three weeks. He 
expressed the hope that the Israeli side will also be ready. 
  [Sha'th] Our expectations are that we are here to write the 
final agreement. We should end this work in three weeks in the 
interest of our peoples. I believe that if intentions are good, 
three weeks will be enough time to reach an agreement that will 
then be submitted to our political leaderships, for amendment, 
approval, and then finally for signing so the implementation of 
this agreement can begin. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Israeli sources ruled out reaching an agreement 
within three week, saying it will take three months? 
  [Sha'th] In this case, you should ask who is ready and who 
is 
not ready. He who says that we need three months violates the 
agreement and does not want to finalize it. The agreement 
should have been finalized on 13 December. However, it was 
postponed due to certain circumstances. We were ready to 
finalize the agreement in one week. So, what happened to make 
this take three months. I believe that this is a test of both 
sides' intentions? 
  [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, are you just going to discuss 
formal issues at today's meeting? 
  [Sha'th] There are things concerning essence and others 
concerning form. In fact, we have not yet discussed the form. 
Therefore, we should write the agreement in a way that will 
enable us to implement it concerning everything on which we have 
agreed. We should use the time to discuss what we do not agree 
on. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, how would al-Asad-Clinton 
meeting affect the talks? 
  [Sha'th] I believe that the al-Asad-Clinton summit will 
succeed in returning Syria to the peace process. This is 
something very positive, and we are looking forward to it 
because we want the entire peace process to succeed--all its 
tracks--not only the Palestinian track. When the 
al-Asad-Clinton summit succeeds to return Syria to the peace 
process, Lebanon and Jordan will also go back to the peace 
process. At that time, we will all be working in the same 
direction; something which supports the entire peace process. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, what are the points on which 
differences are centered? 
  [Sha'th] The truth is that this expression was the result of 
the talks that were held in Cairo, Oslo, and Paris. At that 
time, we decided to focus on the issues of crossings, the size 
of the Jericho area, and the area of the Israeli settlements and 
the security area surrounding them in the Gaza Strip. We 
believe that we made progress concerning these three issues 
although we did not reach full agreement on them. However, 
there are other issues on which we must concentrate this time 
other than these three issues. I believe that these three 
issues, in addition to other points, such as security on land 
and in the sea, security on roads, and the transfer of civil 
powers, are all issues on which we can reach an agreement. This 
is not impossible. We knew that these issues were difficult 
when we began these negotiations, and we also knew that they 
were difficult when we signed the Washington agreement. So, 
there is no surprise here. Differences should not surprise 
anyone, for negotiations constitute a means to reach an 
agreement on points of disagreement through both sides' 
flexibility based on the principles we set in Washington. I 
believe that this is possible.

  [Excerpt] Taba, 10 Jan (MENA)--The Palestinian and Israeli 
delegations concerned with implementing the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement concluded their evening working session after meetings 
that lasted approximately seven hours under Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, and 
General Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff. 
  Dr. Sha'th told reporters that today marks the beginning of 
a 
return to negotiations here in Taba on the basis of the 
principles included in the agreement and the concepts worked out 
in Cairo. He noted that this meeting, which has brought us 
again to Taba, will lead us in the shortest possible time to 
formulate a full agreement on withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. 
He described today's negotiations in Taba as successful and 
useful, noting that all issues were reviewed in preparation for 
forming subcommittees tomorrow to formulate clauses relating to 
security, the transfer of civil powers, and the general 
agreement. He voiced his hope that this work will be completed 
as quickly as possible. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The date of the national conference -- 25-26 January 
-- is approaching, and the political arena is ready to decide on 
the participants, two weeks before the date of the conference. 
A spokesman for the National Dialogue Commission said that the 
conference would not be a conference of parties. The conference 
was the axis of the latest party contacts and statements. 
  The FFS [Socialist Forces Front] has announced that it will 
not participate in the national conference scheduled for 25 and 
26 January. This stance was contained in a statement issued 
today by the National Executive Committee of the FFS. 
  In its analysis of the general situation and the reasons 
behind its nonparticipation, it said that there was a return to 
the unilateral system, the one language and the one thought, 
without any consideration for the Amazighi [Berber] 
peculiarities. The FFS added that it was working for the 
restoration of hope for Algerians, as the statement put it. 
  On the other hand, some parties are holding meetings in the 
form of blocs for consultation and coordination before the 
convening of the conference. Yesterday, a tripartite meeting 
was held between the FLN [National Liberation Front], HAMAS 
[Islamic Society Movement], and the Movement for Democracy in 
Algeria. The meeting, which was held at FLN headquarters, was 
devoted to the preparation of a draft document containing the 
measures, methods, and means for making the national dialogue 
successful, to be sent to the Higher State Council [HCE] and the 
National Dialogue Commission. On this issue, our colleague 
Brahim Zewash telephoned FLN Secretary General Abdelhamid Mehri, 
who answered at the beginning of this short conversation a 
question about the tripartite meeting: 
  [Begin recording] [Mehri] Contacts were made between four 
parties -- HAMAS, al-Nahdah, the Movement for Democracy, and the 
FLN. It began within the framework of the suggestion that we 
submitted to the HCE and the National Dialogue Commission to 
hold a tripartite meeting to study some of the measures that 
will help to make the national dialogue successful. Naturally, 
the suggestion was rejected but the issue remained, as we 
thought that it was beneficial that we should continue our 
meetings and our consultations as part of the measures that are 
apt to help make the national dialogue successful by expanding 
it, on the one hand, and by restoring assurances to society, on 
the other. 
  I believe that we have reached a common ground that will be 
communicated within the next few days to the HCE and to the 
National Dialogue Commission, and will be published. 
  [Zewash] Can you tell us the broad lines of this common 
ground? 
  [Mehri] I prefer, as we have agreed, that we should wait 
until the petition is published. 
  [Zewash] In other words, is there an attempt by these 
parties 
to get closer, either because of the FLN [word indistinct] or 
because we are noticing that these parties have participated in 
the multi-sided meetings? 
  [Mehri] No, the subject of the meeting is defined and all 
the 
sides are in agreement that we meet only on this point. Each 
party has its own independent ideas with regard to the remaining 
issues. We did not attempt to coordinate our stances with regard 
to all issues. 
  [Zewash] In other words, does not the FLN's proposal, 
manifested in a meeting of the political parties -- the HCE and 
the National Dialogue Commission -- mean that there is a 
somewhat exclusion of the social and economic front? 
  [Mehri] There is no exclusion of any side. The HCE and the 
National Dialogue Council have placed us in a group called the 
Group of Six Parties -- we move within this group. We are not 
the ones who called for the dialogue so that we can exclude 
others. The side that called for the dialogue is either the HCE 
-- when it conducted the dialogue -- or the National Dialogue 
Council. On the contrary, we are for expanding the dialogue. 
  [Zewash] Abdelhamid, two weeks remain before the convening 
of 
the national conference, and as you have not participated in the 
recent meeting, is that not considered an obstruction of the 
national conference? 
  [Mehri] No, we were not committed to attend the national 
conference, irrespective of the circumstances. From the first 
day, when the idea of convening a national conference was 
suggested, we asked: Will the conference be a phase of the 
dialogue or the conclusion of the dialogue? We were told: It 
is the conclusion of the dialogue. We said: Therefore, we 
should first agree on the content of the conference. If we 
agree, we will go to the conference, but if we do not agree on 
the content, then we will not attend. 
  [Zewash] What are the proposals that the FLN can submit in 
order to participate in the upcoming national conference? 
  [Mehri] This is a long issue, because a year and a half ago 
we submitted a large number of proposals, and, so far, no 
proposal has been taken into consideration. 
  [Zewash] According to (?close) sources that attended the 
tripartite meeting yesterday, there was an attempt to bring 
about the participation of the dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation 
Front]. 
  [Mehri] We are confined to work within the group that the 
National Dialogue Commission collectively called, and we are 
moving within this group in order to avoid any 
misinterpretation. But the question of the participation of the 
faction that remained in existence following the dissolution of 
the FIS is now naturally recognized by all. 
  [Zewash] The Central Committee of the FLN will be holding an 
emergency meeting in the middle of this month, and it appears -- 
according to press sources -- that there are differences within 
the FLN. Is this true? 
  [Mehri] This is a healthy sign. We do not claim that we are 
working in one voice. All our resolutions were adopted 
following a discussion of all views, and we will discuss all 
views. There is no complexity in this. Even in the darkest of 
circumstances we held meetings that were open to journalists, 
and in these meetings we held discussions openly, but this deep 
and frank discussion among ourselves made the attitude of the 
FLN characterized by responsibility and effectiveness. 
  [Zewash] Will the upcoming meeting of the FLN Central 
Committee be open to the national press? 
  [Mehri] The issue is being discussed, and as yet, no final 
decision has been taken. [end recording]

  His bodyguard, Ahmad Mahmud, died of bullet wounds in 
hospital an hour later. 
  Security forces arrested 14 suspected Muslim fundamentalists

  The detainees included Hamadah Nassar, who heads the 
outlawed 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah in Abnub in Asyut province, as well as a 
key member of the group's military wing, 'Adil 'Abd-al-Ghani 
'Abd-al-Rahim, the official paper said, citing police. 
  Meanwhile in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria 
security forces arrested an Islamic militant as he was preparing

found to contain three bottles filled with inflammable liquid. 
  Mahrus, a grocer and known Islamic militant, later admitted 
planning to set fire to the cinema during a performance, police 
said. [passage omitted]

<TEXT>
Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial report] In a 3,000-word article entitled "A 
Bundle of Lessons From Algeria" on page 9 of Cairo AL-AHRAM in 
Arabic on 4 January, writer Fahmi Huwaydi views the events in 
Algeria in 1993. He notes that the 1993 "bitter harvest" in 
Algeria is full of "precious lessons that we must examine one 
after the other" to learn the "lessons and examples that are of 
interest to us all, without exception." 
  The first lesson to be learned from the Algerian crisis, the 
writer notes, is that "violence generates violence and blind 
repression serves as a fuel for terrorism." After reviewing the 
events that triggered the crisis in Algeria, Huwaydi adds: 
"When the authority realized rather belatedly--20 months after 
the start of the bloody confrontations--that it was necessary to 
reopen the door of dialogue with the moderates in the Islamic 
Salvation Front, the front's leaders detained in prisons since 
the beginning of 1992 had almost lost control of their elements 
abroad, who were scattered and distributed among various groups. 
Worse still, the armed group rejected the dialogue and vowed to 
continue the fighting until the end." Now, he adds, secret 
contacts are under way to find moderates within the Islamic 
Front to find a way out of the crisis. 
  The second lesson, he adds, is that "Arabism and Islam are 
the core of the conflict." He points out that the Algerian 
government crackdown on the Islamic Front was not in defense of 
democracy but rather against the front's affiliation with 
Arabism, Islam, and independence from French hegemony. He notes 
that "in the name of defending the republic and a secular 
society, a motley of intellectuals and politicians has given 
their full backing to the policy of repression and elimination 
by depicting whoever is affiliated with Islam as a terrorist." 
  Continuing his article, Huwaydi points out that the third 
lesson is that the "blackout has unleashed the forces of evil 
and provided a chance for penetration." He notes that the ban 
on political activity has made "clandestine activity" the only 
alternative, thus giving various elements the chance to move in 
the dark knowing for certain that the fingers of accusation will 
point to the obvious "defendant, in this case the Salvation 
Front. He refers to a theory in Algeria arguing that 
"suspicious quarters" are working hard to create chaos in the 
country. 
  The fourth lesson advanced by Huwaydi is that the "crisis 
has 
weakened the state and forced it to bow." Noting that the 
crisis has paralyzed the Algerian economy and forced the prime 
minister to announce that the country is unable to service its 
foreign debts, the government had no alternative but to sign an 
"unfavorable" agreement to reschedule its debts and acquiesce to 
the "harsh" terms imposed by the IMF to finalize the 
rescheduling. 
  The fifth lesson to be learned from the crisis, Huwaydi 
adds, 
is that it has resulted in a "decline in Western support." He 
cites a French paper as saying that the Western governments 
backed the current regime in Algeria as the "lesser of two 
evils" compared to the fundamentalists, but now the West is 
wondering if its policy was correct.

  [Text] official sources in the Manpower and Employment 
Ministry have disclosed that approximately 500,000 Egyptian 
workers have returned from Libya because of the negative effects 
of the economic embargo imposed on the Libyan Jamahiriyah after 
the Lockerbie crisis. These sources pointed out that the 
Egyptian workers in Libya are faced with two options: Either to 
accept transforming their work contracts to local contracts and 
thus lose housing and transportation allowances or to return to 
Egypt. The Foreign Ministry has formed a committee of all 
concerned agencies to request the Security Council to speed up 
efforts to pay compensation to the countries that are harmed by 
the continuing embargo imposed on the Libyan Jamahiriyah.

<F P=106> [By David Chazan] </F>
  [Text] Nairobi, Jan 10 (AFP) -- A Sudanese rebel leader on 
Monday accused a rival insurgent group of preparing to attack 
his forces despite a ceasefire agreement between the two 
factions. 
  Riak Mashar, leader of a breakaway group of the Sudan 
People's Liberation Army (SPLA), said the Islamic fundamentalist 
government was also massing troops for a new offensive against 
the mainly Christian and animist southern rebels. 
  Fighting reportedly erupted between rebels and government 
forces near the Ugandan border last week, but details were 
unclear. 
  Riak told AFP that John Garang, chief of the mainstream SPLA 
faction, was preparing an attack despite a new agreement between 
the rival rebel factions to conduct joint negotiations with 
Khartoum. "Garang is planning an attack on our positions at 
Lafun, north of Torit, in the next day or so," Riak told AFP. 
Torit, a town near Sudan's southern border with Uganda, has 
often been used by Garang as his field headquarters. "This is 
unfortunate, and I am still hoping that the ceasefire will 
hold," Riak said. 
  A spokesman for Garang's group, however, denied the 
allegation. "It is not true," said Philip Lomodong, the 
faction's east African representative. Riak and Garang said 
they had agreed after talks in Nairobi last week with 
representatives of regional governments to renew a ceasefire 
declared in October. 
  Riak, however, said Garang's group had broken the ceasefire 
only a week after it was agreed, and had captured two of his 
positions at Iktos and Chikudum in October. There had been no 
other major fighting between the two rival SPLA groups since 
October, he said. 
  Riak said the government was "building up its forces for a 
new offensive" and was transporting troops to the south in five 
barges on the Nile. "We are expecting heavy fighting soon," he 
said. 
  Riak's SPLA United and Garang's SPLA last week agreed to 
negotiate jointly with Khartoum after talks here with foreign 
ministers from Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda, members of 
the regional group the Inter-governmental Authority on Drought 
and Development (IGAAD). 
  The rebels are demanding self-determination for the vast, 
undeveloped south, where UN officials say a million people need 
food aid. But they might delay a proposed referendum on 
establishing an independent southern state if Khartoum agreed to 
interim arrangements, rebel officials said. 
  Philip O'Brien, head of the UN's Operation Lifeline Sudan, 
said an outbreak of fighting between rebel and government forces 
would disrupt aid and could spark a huge humanitarian crisis. 
  Sudanese government representatives who also met the IGADD 
ministers in Nairobi last week reiterated Khartoum's refusal to 
allow the south to secede. 
  Riak's faction split from Garang's group in 1991 because 
Garang rejected calls for an independent south, insisting that 
he could break Moslem domination without dividing Sudan. But 
Garang has since changed his position to favour a referendum. 
"We are working to form a joint delegation to the peace talks 
with Khartoum which we hope will soon be convened by the IGADD," 
Riak said. 
  "We have been fighting amongst ourselves on the question of 
self- determination," Riak said. "Now that Garang has changed, 
we are urging the international community to put pressure on 
Khartoum so that new talks can be held." 
  Theoretically the next step in the process to end Sudan's 
decade-long war is a new round of IGAAD-mediated talks. But 
African diplomats expressed fears that Khartoum, whose relations 
with the West are strained, would instead mount an offensive. 
  Fighting between rebel and government forces, and between 
the 
rival rebel factions, has often stopped aid from reaching the 
inaccessible southern swamplands, UN officials said. 
  "The humanitarian situation is appalling," Riak said.

  [Excerpt] Khartoum, 11 Jan (AFP) -- Eleven high-ranking 
members of the rebel the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) 
switched sides to join government forces in the north of the 
country, a government newspaper reported Monday. The daily 
AL-INQADH AL-WATANI said the 11 had announced their defection 
during a meeting with Parliamentary Speaker Muhammad al-Amin 
Khalifah in Malakal. 
  The news came after allegations earlier Monday by rival 
rebel 
leader Riak Mashar that the SPLA under John Garang was preparing 
to attack his forces despite a ceasefire agreement between the 
two factions. Riak, leader of SPLA United, which broke away 
from the SPLA, said the Islamic fundamentalist government was 
also massing troops for a new offensive against the mainly 
Christian and animist southern rebels. Fighting reportedly 
erupted between rebels and government forces near the Ugandan 
border last week, but details were unclear. 
  According to the paper the head of the defecting rebels, 
Colonel Thomas Dut, said that he and his colleagues had decided 
to quit Garang's SPLA in order "to take part in rebuilding the 
country." 
  Riak told AFP earlier Monday that Garang was preparing an 
attack despite a new agreement between the rival rebel factions 
to conduct joint negotiations with Khartoum. But a spokesman 
for Garang's group denied the allegation. "It is not true," 
said Philip Lomodong, the faction's east African representative. 
  Meanwhile the Sudanese Government Monday launched an aid 
operation to deliver 62,000 tonnes of food to people in the 
stricken south of the country. Aid Commissioner Awad Khalifah 
said the deliveries would be made by rail from Babanoussa to 
Wau, or by river from Kosti to Juba. Ismail Moustafa, head of 
the department for displaced people, said 3,624 families 
currently living in camps around Khartoum would be able to go 
home. He added that 15,000 people had become refugees since the 
start of the civil war in 1983, and were now living in four 
camps around Khartoum, where the Sudanese parliament is based.

  Yemeni ulema today held a further meeting at Mu'az 
Bin-Jabal Mosque in the al-Janad region for a review of our 
country's political crisis. They set up five subcommittees [as

response to the president's speech; and one to propose solutions 
to the crisis. The subcommittees began their work as soon as 
they were named. 
  The Yemeni news agency, SABA', has learned that contacts 
have 
been made with the General People's Congress, the Yemeni 
Socialist Party, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, the Political 
Forces Dialouge Committee, and the Fact-Finding Committee. They 
were informed of the ulema's decision that each party and 
committee must send a representative to the ulema's meeting in 
al-Janad in order for them to air their views on the political 
crisis and its underlying causes and to propose solutions. The 
ulema are now waiting for the representatives to arrive, now 
that agreement of the parties and committees was obtained. 
SABA' has also learned that the ulema have promised to remain 
in the Mu'az Bin-Jabal Mosque until 'Ali Salim al-Bid, the vice 
chairman of the Presidential Council, shows up there.

  [Text] The political forces' dialogue committee held a 
meeting this evening in the economic and commercial capital, 
Aden. The committee began to debate a document of pledge and 
agreement between the parties to the dialogue of political 
forces to build a modern Yemeni state. The document was drafted 
by a subcommittee emanating from the political forces' dialogue 
committee. 
  The draft document states the solutions reached by the 
dialogue committee to the current issues and problems that 
caused the current crisis. The draft is also a prelude to the 
building of a modern Yemeni state as it sets forth foundations 
for stability and order and ensures that such crises will not be 
repeated. This is meant to protect and safeguard unity, enhance 
Yemen's democratic process, and broaden popular participation 
along the road of establishing a developed Yemeni state that 
safeguards the rights of citizens and provides them with equal 
opportunities. This will allow for the achievement of balanced 
socioeconomic development. 
  The committee is still in session and continues to debate 
the 
draft document.

<F P=106> [Report by Rabi' Shahin] </F>
  [Text] In an exclusive statement to AL-SHA'B, Ibrahim 
al-Bishari, Libyan envoy to the Arab League, accused foreign 
elements of kidnapping Libyan opposition figure Mansur 
al-Kikhya. He stressed that al-Kikhya's disappearance is a 
riddle, noting that Libya will not sacrifice its relations with 
Egypt for the sake of a Libyan opponent. He denied that his 
country is involved in kidnapping al-Kikhya, stressing that 
there are relations of friendship between the former Libyan 
minister and the Libyan regime's leaders. He pointed out that 
al-Kikhya did not constitute the least danger for Libya, making 
it sacrifice its relations and interests with Egypt. He said 
al-Kikyha is a man of high standing and the revolution honored 
him and appointed him a minister. When he reached retirement 
age, brother Colonel al-Qadhdhafi asked him to go to Algeria as 
part of the visiting Libyan delegation when Ben Bella returned 
to Algeria. 
  Al-Bishari pointed out that the culprit in the disappearance 
of al-Kikhya has interests in continuing the embargo against 
Libya, starving the Libyan people, maintaining the threat of the 
Lockerbie case against Libya, and harming Libyan-Egyptian 
relations. 
  Discussing the Lockerbie crisis, al-Bishari stressed that it 
could have been settled peacefully in November 1991 had it 
followed a legal course and had the Western nations cooperated 
with the Libyan Judiciary. He said Libya was surprised when the 
Western nations brought the case out of its framework and 
imposed it on the UN Security Council and passed resolutions to 
impose the embargo on the Libyan people. He pointed out that 
his country suggested every possible proposal to solve the issue 
peacefully without harming its sovereignty, independence, or 
supreme interests. And Libya, he said, expressed readiness to 
cooperate with every party and implement the UN Charter, which 
calls for maintaining security and peace. We also offered to 
compensate the families of the victims. 
  Al-Bishari did not rule out a peaceful solution to the 
Lockerbie crisis, noting the mediation efforts by heads of state 
and countries including President Mubarak. He stressed that 
Libya seeks to establish good ties with Washington as a 
superpower and has interests in Libya. He noted that Egypt and 
Tunisia are trying hard to reach this goal. He said his country 
seeks no confrontation with Washington but will not relinquish 
its national interests or the Arab nation's right to exist and 
have unity. 
  Al-Bishari stressed that the retreat of the main witness in 
the Lockerbie case, which will greatly help his country, is 
considered to be an important development in the case that might 
influence public opinion and the attitude of the nonpermanent 
members of the Security Council, which were pressured to vote 
against Libya.

<F P=106> [Report by Magdi Allam: "The Thriller Story of the Abducted </F>
Leader" 
  [Text] Cairo -- "My husband, Mansur al-Kikhya, succeeded 
two months ago in uniting all the Libyan opposition forces 
during a meeting in Algeria, the first time this happened on a 
serious political and strategic platform. On this occasion a 
second meeting between the opposition forces was scheduled in 
order to take a further step forward in their common action. 
This is probably why al-Qadhdhafi had him abducted." And why 
Mrs. Baha al-Amry, wife of Tripoli's former foreign minister and 
leader of the "Libyan Patriotic Alliance," who disappeared in 
Cairo on 10 December last, made this revelation. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi was probably not wanting so much to hit 
al-Kikhya, with whom he had been in dialogue at a distance for 
some time, nor the opposition forces as a whole, who have never 
constituted a serious threat to his power, rather he was 
probably aiming to give a serious warning to Algeria not to get 
involved in Libya's domestic affairs. On its side, Algeria has 
taken the initiative in unifying the Libyan opposition in 
reaction to al-Qadhdhafi's support for the Algerian 
fundamentalists of the outlawed "Islamic Salvation Front." In 
short, al-Kikhya's abduction should be seen as part of the 
settlement of accounts between Libya and Algeria in what is a 
pretty critical phase for both regimes in power. It is 
significant that al-Kikhya, aged 63 and holder of an Algerian 
diplomatic passport, had obtained political asylum in France and 
had asked to be granted American citizenship as his wife, of 
Syrian origin, is a U.S. citizen. And now Mrs. al-Amry has 
written to President Clinton requesting that her husband be 
granted U.S. citizenship, in the hope that the seriousness and 
risks of a direct encounter with Washington will induce 
al-Qadhdhafi to take a softer approach. "Al-Qadhdhafi is 
behaving like someone who is desperate, he has been squeezed by 
sanctions, driven into a corner by the international community, 
and is reacting in an irrational manner, shouting as loud as he 
can to make himself heard, " Mrs. al-Amry commented. 
  "It is true that there are no concrete proof that my husband 
has been abducted by al-Qadhdhafi," she said, with one eye on 
the masters of the house who are interested in maintaining a low 
profile on the matter so as not to jeopardize the jobs of one 
million Egyptian emigrants in Libya. But she added that 
al-Qadhdhafi's thesis that her husband's disappearance was due 
to "a settlement of accounts between two opposition groups" was 
improbable. "The opposition is not involved," Mrs. al-Amry cut 
us short, in particular as "after al-Kikhya's disappearance they 
are now all united as he would have wished." 
  The other strange aspect of this intricate thriller story on 
the Nile relates to the personal relationships between al-Kikhya 
and al-Qadhdhafi. "My husband was in favor of dialogue with 
everyone, even with al-Qadhdhafi's emissaries," Mrs. al-Amry 
said, not hiding her own disapproval. "He placed conditions 
only on the repeated request to return and live in Libya." In 
particular al-Kikhya, in meetings in Paris with Ahmad Gheddaf 
Eddaru, al-Qadhdhafi's cousin and head of the civil service, and 
with others of the Libyan leader's emissaries, had placed four 
conditions: recognition of the opposition forces, their 
involvement in the management of power, the liberation of 
political detainees, and the introduction of a democratic 
system. "Obviously al-Qadhdhafi's reply was negative," Mrs. 
al-Amry maintained. "He cannot live with democracy." 
  The proofs of al-Qadhdhafi's responsibility in this 
abduction 
are listed in a communique circulated in Cairo by the "Libyan 
Patriotic Alliance," led by al-Kikhya. First of all it reminds 
readers, and in particular the Egyptian authorities who are 
accused of not carrying out an adequate investigation, that a 
Libyan agent, whose mediation al-Kikhya had refused for 
contacting members of the regime, also disappeared from Cairo on 
10 December and reappeared two days later at Benghazi's Tibesti 
hotel. Moreover, on 11 December, at 1130, three automobiles 
with Libyan diplomatic plates crossed the Al-Salum frontier post 
heading for Tobruk, without being subjected to any inspection. 
There is a strong suspicion that one of these automobiles 
contained al-Kikhya. 
  Will he now come to the same end as Imam Moussa Al Sadr, the 
Lebanese Shiite religious dignitary, who disappeared 
mysteriously in Libya in August 1980? Then al-Qadhdhafi tried 
to unload the blame onto Italy, sending a look-alike of the imam 
to Rome who then disappeared without trace. "I will not give 
anyone any respite until I have my husband back," his wife 
assured us.

  [Editorial Report] Tripoli Libyan Television Network in 
Arabic at 1949 GMT on 7 January carries a 66-minute recorded 
speech by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi "to the 
masses of Surman and Abu 'Isa" on 2 January. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi says that with this speech he is concluding his 
visits to various parts of the country. He says that the world 
has witnessed the reaction of the Libyan people and how they are 
rallying in defense of their country and rights. The Libyans 
have not attacked another country, nor interfered in other 
people's affairs. We live on our land and want peace with 
others. He again asks how the author of The Satanic 
Verses can be received by Western leaders. If we hold out 
the olive branch to them, they will not accept. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi then recalls how the Libyan people resisted 
Italy. The people refused to submit. He says the Libyan people 
will not surrender despite the weapons the West has. The West 
asks why the Libyans meet with Abu Nidal, Jibril, etc. We meet 
them because these people are strugglers fighting for their 
land. George Washington fought the British as Abu Nidal is 
doing. Regarding the IRA, al-Qadhdhafi says that Libya meets 
the IRA just as the British meet the IRA in secret. The West 
says Kurds in Iraq have rights but Kurds in Turkey don't -- this 
is because Turkey is with the West. Imperialist circles are 
against all those who refuse to surrender. They want to make 
profits at our expense. We will triumph because our enemy looks 
for profit. No matter what we do these people do not want our 
friendship.

  [Editorial Report] Tripoli Libyan Television Network in 
Arabic at 2022 GMT on 8 January begins broadcasting a recording 
of a speech by Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi on 5 January 
to the residents of Abu Salim during his visit there. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi begins his speech by thanking the audience for 
a 
warm welcome. He says he values the courage displayed by the 
masses in this area against the possibilities of confrontation 
with the enemy and coping with economic sanctions. He 
underlines the fact that many tribes in Libya used to boast 
about how many martyrs they had given in their fight against the 
Italians. Today, Libyans are facing a direct confrontation with 
America and Europe. When you want to abuse someone you call him 
a renegade, he says, but no Libyan family wants to bring up a 
renegade. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi goes on to talk about the Muslim Brotherhood 
and 
other religious fanatics. He describes them as people who 
reneged on Islam and the prophet's teachings. Foreign 
intelligence agencies are behind these Islamic tendencies, he 
states. The West wants Arab oil and it will do anything to get 
it. During the life of the Prophet Muhammad none of these 
Islamic movements existed. The Zoroastrians brought many of 
their rituals into Islam in the early days of the faith -- 
things that are alien to Islam, he says. 
  There is a cold war going on today between the enemy and 
Libyans, he continues. America cannot send its sons to Libya to 
be killed, nor does it want to sacrifice its children on Libyan 
soil. As for traitors, these are dealt with by the police and 
the law, and the people set on them and burn their homes and 
their farms. Treason is under siege by the Libyan people. No 
one today can commit treason against the people and get away 
with it, he concludes. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi goes on to say that the people of Abu Salim 
represent the entire people of Libya from the point of Arabism, 
patriotism, and other traits. The people of Abu Salim should 
bring up their children the right way. The general people's 
congresses are the place to make laws and to decide on many 
issues. The important thing is that the people must consume 
what they themselves produce and they must forget about 
importing worthless European goods, he says. Libyans should 
exploit all the potential they have at their disposal whether 
industrial or agricultural. Every family should regard oil as 
if it never existed in Libya and should therefore live without 
its benefits. If the West does not want to buy Libyan oil, so 
be it, he stresses. Libyans will not kneel or beg them to buy 
the oil. Libyans should boycott Japanese goods because Japan 
was one of the first to impose the sanctions, al-Qadhdhafi says. 
Libyans fought against the Italians long before the Italians 
started to export Italian goods and foods. Libyans should not 
import anything from the West if the West keeps its hostility to 
Libya, he concludes.

  [Text] Tripoli, Ay-Annar [January] 7 Jamahiriyah News 
Agency -- Voice of America radio reported that an American group 
concerned with what it calls "human rights", has put pressure on 
Syria to release 15 Syrians whom are said are being held in 
Syrian prisons. 
  The Arab affairs editor in the Jamahiriyah News Agency 
commented on this saying: 
  "Such actions constitute blatant interference in Syria's 
internal affairs". 
  The editor questioned whether the United States would accept 
that anyone could demand of the American President Bill Clinton 
to release American prisoners in American jails. 
  The editor said that this condescending manner with which 
America views the rest of the world has plunged the world into 
crisis. They do not allow anyone else to treat them as they 
treat others in the belief that they are unique and others are 
not allowed to do what the United States allows itself to do.

Declaration states at conclusion of meetings on 10 January; 
passages in boldface omitted in Damascus Syrian Arab Republic 
Radio in Arabic newscasts at 1915 and 2115 GMT and by Damascus 
Syrian Arab Television Network in Arabic in its 1830 GMT

  [Text] Their highnesses and excellencies the foreign 
ministers of the Damascus Declaration states held their eighth 
meeting on Sunday and Monday, 27 and 28 Rajab, 1414 Hegira, 
corresponding to 9 and 10 January 1994, in the city of Damascus 
under the chairmanship of Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' 
and in the presence of His Highness Rashid 'Abdallah al-Nu'aymi, 
foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates; His Highness 
Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Mubarak Al Khalifah, minister of foreign 
affairs in the State of Bahrain; His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud 
al-Faysal, minister of foreign affairs in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia; His Highness Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah, minister of 
state for foreign affairs in the Sultanate of Oman; His Highness 
Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabr Al Thani, minister of foreign 
affairs in the State of Qatar; His Highness Shaykh Sabah 
al-Ahmad al-Jabir al-Sabah, first deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs in the State of Kuwait; and Mr. 'Amr 
Musa, minister of foreign affairs in the Arab Republic of Egypt. 
  His Highness Shaykh Fahim Bin-Sultan al-Qasimi, secretary 
general of the Gulf Cooperation Council, also participated in 
the meetings. 
The ministers reviewed the Middle East peace process and 
discussed its developments since the signing of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, considering it a 
first step that should be completed by steps on the other tracks 
in order to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region. 
  In their deliberations, the ministers concentrated on the 
extreme importance of the anticipated summit meeting between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. They underscored the 
vital and important Syrian role in securing the success of the 
Middle East peace process and emphasized their states' strong 
support for President al-Asad. They expressed the hope that 
this meeting will lead to a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, 
and 425 and the land-for-peace principle in a manner that leads 
to the Israeli withdrawal from all of the Arab territories 
occupied in 1967, including Arab Jerusalem, and guarantees the 
Palestinian Arab people's national rights. 
  The ministers have discussed the situation in the Gulf 
region. In this regard, the ministers reaffirm their countries' 
concern for the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of 
Iraq. They also hold the Iraqi regime fully responsible for the 
suffering being experienced by the Iraqi people. 
The ministers strongly condemn the Iraqi regime because of 
its pursuit of a selective approach in its implementation of the 
resolutions of international legitimacy regarding its aggression 
against the State of Kuwait, because it has continued to 
threaten Kuwait, and also because of its hostile conduct toward 
Kuwait. Moreover, they reaffirm their full support for the State 
of Kuwait in the face of all these threats, and renew their 
demand that the Iraqi regime comply with the cease-fire terms 
and honor all relevant UN Security Council resolutions, 
particularly those concerning borders, the release of all 
Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti prisoners and detainees, and 
compensation. 
The ministers reiterate that respect by Iraq for the 
sovereignty and independence of the State of Kuwait and its 
international borders, as approved by the UN Security Council 
per Resolution 833, is at the heart of the commitments enshrined 
in UN Security Council Resolution 687, and that its failure to 
do so would be a violation of the essence of this 
resolution. 
  The ministers have also reviewed with interest the call made 
by His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, president 
of the United Arab Emirates [UAE], urging the Islamic Republic 
of Iran to hold a direct dialogue with the UAE on its 
occupation of the three UAE islands of Tunb al-Sughra, Tunb 
al-Kubra, and Abu Musa. While commending this call, the 
ministers urge Iran to respond favorably to this call, 
particularly since it seeks to reach a peaceful settlement of 
this dispute in line with international law, international 
conventions, and the principles of good neighborliness, and 
mutual respect among states. The ministers reaffirm their 
support and backing for the peaceful measures and means the UAE 
may pursue to regain its sovereignty over these three 
islands. 
  The ministers once again voice their grave concern over 
developments in Somalia. They appeal to all Somali leaders 
and factions to make the national interest outweigh all other 
considerations. They also urge them to comply with the UN 
Security Council resolutions, and cooperate with the efforts of 
both the United Nations and the OAU to ensure the achievement of 
peace, security, and stability in Somalia. 
  The ministers voiced grave concern over the situation 
in Afghanistan and appealed to all the leaders to give priority 
to national interests to safeguard the Afghan people's 
interests. 
  The ministers also voiced their deep concern for the failure 
of the influential world forces to take note of the tragic 
political and humanitarian situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
They vehemently condemned the continued Serbian aggression 
and the Serbs perpetration of all kinds of crimes against 
humanity. The ministers called on the UN Security Council and 
the influential international forces to take all necessary 
measures, including the lifting of the arms embargo from Bosnia 
and Hercegovina, to end this people's tragedy. They also called 
for them to maintain the sanctions imposed on Serbia until it 
respects the resolutions and principles of international 
legitimacy, and halts its violations of the territorial 
integrity of Bosnia-Hercegovina and of its people's rights. 
  The ministers noted with satisfaction the implementation of 
the recommendations issued at their previous meeting in Abu 
Dhabi on 12-13 June 1993, which seek to invigorate political and 
economic coordination and cooperation among the Damascus 
Declaration countries in a manner that will enable them to 
proceed with this march of cooperation in accordance with the 
objectives and principles of the Damascus Declaration. 
  The ministers expressed their thanks and appreciation to the 
Syrian Arab Republic president, government, and people for 
hosting this meeting and for the warm welcome and the 
hospitality they were accorded. 
  The ministers welcomed the kind invitation Kuwait has 
extended to host the next meeting of the Damascus Declaration 
states' foreign ministers in Kuwait. 
  Faruq al-Shar' concluded the meeting of the foreign 
ministers 
of the Damascus Declaration states with a speech in which he 
said: Your Highnesses and Excellencies, Dear Brothers: At the 
end of our meetings yesterday and today I would like, on behalf 
of the Syrian Arab Republic, to express great satisfaction with 
the results that we attained during our deliberations. I would 
like to thank you all for the cooperation we have sensed during 
our meetings and for the sincere spirit that prevailed among us 
enabling us to reach a common perspective on all the issues we 
have discussed and about which we have adopted the appropriate 
stands. 
  Al-Shar' added: As I said in my opening speech, our stands 
toward the basic issues are identical or very close. There are 
no serious differences between us. Hence, we express our 
satisfaction as well as our thanks for all the efforts and pains 
you have taken to reach this satisfactory result. As I said a 
short while ago, the statement issued in the name of us all as 
eight Arab states contains the main topics discussed during your 
deliberations. 
  The foreign minister added: We also agreed to hold the next 
meeting in the sisterly State of Kuwait and we are happy to do 
so at the appropriate time. Once again I thank you for 
accepting our invitation to participate in this important 
meeting, which came at a critical time in the region's life, 
hoping that our unified positions, joint concepts, and 
aspiration for a real Arab solidarity will deliver this nation 
from the setbacks to which it was exposed and help us all 
rectify the big imbalance existing in the Arab arena. Thus we 
can confront future challenges with sincere determination and 
unified opinion on whose basis we can restore our legitimate 
rights and occupied lands and achieve a just and comprehensive 
peace in this region on the basis of UN Resolutions 242, 338, 
and 425. In the meantime, we stress that realizing such peace 
will inevitably achieve security and stability in the region--a 
region that has suffered a great deal and offered many 
sacrifices. Our cooperation will, God willing, continue. The 
words we exchanged on our faith in cooperation and coordination 
among our states, our comprehensive Arab vision, and our desire 
to lay the basis of pan-Arab security will all place our march 
on the right track. 
  We pray to God to grant us all success. I thank you again 
for taking the trouble of coming to Syria -- your country. I 
wish you success and a safe return home. 
  Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, meanwhile, gave a speech, in which 
he 
said: 
  My colleagues have asked me to speak on their behalf and 
extend our thanks to His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad and 
his government, as well as the Syrian people for the hospitality 
and kind reception accorded us in this hospitable country. We 
are all extremely happy with the outcome of our meeting. 
  We are equally satisfied with the progress the eight 
countries have made in their effort to advance their 
cooperation. We are similarly impressed by the course we have 
charted for our future action. I must thank the conference 
chairman for the wise way in which he conducted our sessions and 
for attaining the outcome we had set out to achieve -- results 
that matched our leaders' aspirations as the eight states 
proceed within the framework of the Damascus Declaration. 
  On behalf of all of us, I would like to tell brotherly Syria 
that we fully appreciate its attachment to Arab causes, notably 
the peace process. In this regard, we were impressed by the 
Syrian official assertions, echoed by His Excellency President 
Hafiz al-Asad to us this morning, that Syria will continue to 
work relentlessly to promote a just and comprehensive peace in 
the region. I take this opportunity to tell my brother [Faruq 
al-Shar'] and through him His Excellency President Hafiz 
al-Asad, as well as the Syrian people and Government, that they 
can count on all of us supporting Syria until such peace that 
meets our interests and our legitimate demands comes to the 
region. Again, we thank the conference chairman for the 
successful way in which he conducted its proceedings. We hope 
the next sessions will be just as successful. We join you in 
thanking Kuwait for offering to host our next session. Thank 
you, Your Excellency Mr. Al-Shar'. Please accept our wishes of 
success and prosperity for the brotherly Syrian people. 
Farewell.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Damascus Declaration 
foreign ministers held a closed meeting this morning, during 
which they continued their discussion of the topics listed on 
the agenda. 
  In a statement to reporters this morning, Foreign Minister 
Faruq al-Shar' said: We are satisfied with the deliberations 
taking place among the foreign ministers of the Damascus 
Declaration states. The ministers expressed interest in the 
declaration and the need to activate it and implement its 
provisions in the various domains, particularly the political 
and economic ones. Moreover, all the ministers expressed a 
great deal of interest in the anticipated summit between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. Al-Shar' stressed 
that the anticipated summit is very important, as admitted by 
several countries and nations in the region. Al-Shar' said: We 
look forward with optimism to the summit meeting in order to 
achieve results and successes that would help establish a just 
and comprehensive peace in the region on the basis of the 
resolutions of international legitimacy and the land-for-peace 
principle. He added: The topics the two presidents will 
discuss in Geneva are the peace process and the way to achieve a 
just and comprehensive peace, in addition to bilateral 
relations. An extensive discussion will be held on the overall 
situation in the region. 
  In a statement to reporters today, Egyptian Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa stressed the need to implement the Damascus 
Declaration provisions, indicating that the current meeting of 
the declaration states' foreign ministers will boost the Syrian 
position on the restoration of the Golan. He called for seeking 
the best ways and means to serve the Arab economic situation. 
Musa paid tribute to the fraternal relations between Syria and 
Egypt and described them as strong. He said: Bilateral 
coordination exists and continues. 
  Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin Jabr Al Thani 
said the Damascus Declaration is not a bloc disconnected with 
the Arab League, but a group of principles agreed on by the 
eight states to provide an appropriate atmosphere for joint 
cooperation under all circumstances. In a radio statement 
today, Shaykh Hamad said he hoped that the Damascus Declaration 
will continue to exist and serve as a model for the other Arab 
states. The Qatari minister said that it is joint interests 
that determine cooperation among states. Hence, he said, the 
Damascus Declaration was ratified. He stressed his country's 
commitment to the joint Arab action regarding the Arab boycott 
of Israel.

Bin-Jasim Al Thani, in Damascus, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, on 
the "Dialogue From Afar" program; date not given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Al-Jundi] Reports from 
Damascus say the foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration 
states will discuss Arab reconciliation. 
  [Al Thani] The agenda is open for discussion. We hope this 
subject will be discussed. Qatar's view on it is known. 
  [Al-Jundi] What is Qatar's position? 
  [Al Thani] Qatar unreservedly favors any Arab reconciliation 
and closing Arab ranks. 
  [Al-Jundi] Does this meeting of the Damascus Declaration 
foreign ministers have particular significance in light of the 
recent Middle East developments? 
  [Al Thani] Perhaps the discussion of peace developments is 
one of the most important topics at the meeting. But there are 
other important issues to be discussed. We hope we can achieve 
positive results. 
  [Al-Jundi] Speaking of the situation in the Middle East, is 
the Gulf Cooperation Council now inclined to lift the Arab 
boycott against Israel? 
  [Al Thani] The Arab boycott was introduced by an Arab League 
decision. I believe the Arab League is the right venue at which 
a decision on removing the boycott should be made. I am 
discussing the primary boycott, the first-degree boycott. As 
regards other degrees of boycott, Qatar will do what is 
necessary when the other negotiating tracks, notably the Syrian 
and Lebanese, are advanced. 
  [Al-Jundi] But Qatar was the first Gulf state to begin 
telephone contacts with Israel. Is this an action distinct from 
any by the Gulf Cooperation Council states? 
  [Al Thani] I cannot discuss distinction. We assumed this 
position and others can judge it. But we made the decision for 
humanitarian reasons. We opened telephone links with the West 
Bank and Gaza for humanitarian reasons. There are many 
Palestinians in Qatar who want to contact their families 
directly. It is a humanitarian issue. 
  [Al-Jundi] What can the Gulf Cooperation Council offer to 
support the Palestinian-Israeli agreement? 
  [Al Thani] As you know, the Gulf Cooperation Council has 
helped the Palestinian cause a great deal. I believe that if 
the Council helped in the days of war and estrangement, it will 
spare no effort to help during the peace process. 
  [Al-Jundi] Have you in the Gulf agreed to provide specific 
amounts of money to support the Gaza-Jericho agreement? 
  [Al Thani] No, we have agreed on no such thing. 
  [Al-Jundi] Thank you. 
  [Al Thani] Thank you.

  [Text] Damascus, Jan 10, IRNA -- The meeting of foreign 
ministers of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council (PGCC) and 
those of Egypt and Syria ended here today without any concrete 
results. 
  In the two-day meeting, members of the PGCC did not reach an 
agreement for implementing of an article of Damascus Agreement 
which calls for cooperation with Syria and Egypt. The Damascus 
Agreement which was signed in the aftermath of the occupation of 
Kuwait by Iraq envisaged economic, political and military 
cooperation between the PGCC member states with Syria and Egypt. 
  The agreement provided for the deployment of Egyptian and 
Syrian forces in the Persian Gulf for maintaining the security 
of the region. However, some of the PGCC members, having signed 
bilateral pacts with the U.S.A. and some of the western 
countries, are no longer inclined to see the Egyptian and Syrian 
forces in the region. 
  The failure of the meeting is viewed by some political 
observers here to have stricken a serious blow to the Damascus 
Agreement.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The Significance of 
International Attention," AL-THAWRAH says: Over the past 20 
years, no summit between two or more world leaders has received 
as much attention as the upcoming summit between Presidents 
Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. An objective analysis of the 
significance of this exceptional attention will show that the 
reason for this is that the Syrian-U.S. summit is an important, 
historic event on whose results depends the future of the entire 
Middle East. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: The summit, as it is planned for, is a 
meeting for peace in the Middle East. Its major topic is how to 
end the deadlock in the peace process that resulted from 
Israel's intransigent policy. 
  AL-THAWRAH goes on: Certainly, President Clinton, who has 
already emphasized his eagerness to meet President al-Asad, will 
ascertain Syria's true desire to achieve peace in the region, 
its serious stance toward the peace process, and its unchanging 
concern to provide all the means possible to make this process 
succeed and achieve its major objective -- a comprehensive 
solution based on a just, full peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes: The purpose of the al-Asad-Clinton 
summit is to rectify the course of the peace process and give it 
a new momentum to ensure that it will make progress. 
  Under the headline "The Geneva Summit," TISHRIN says: Rarely 
have we seen political meetings that received a broad political 
and media attention that equals the attention focused now on the 
expected summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill 
Clinton. 
  Since the announcement of the meeting, politicians and 
newsmen have been expressing their views and the world media 
organs -- in their various political shades and professional 
levels -- have been full of articles and commentaries about this 
major event. 
  TISHRIN says this attention has not come out of a vacuum. It 
is truly a natural outcome of the weight of the two presidents 
and reflects, at the same time, the hopes pinned by 
international quarters regarding the possibility of advancing 
the peace process in this region, which occupies the heart of 
the world and represents a mainstay of the life cycle in it. 
  TISHRIN adds: The international community, which is seeking 
peace and stability in the Middle East, has found out after many 
long experiences that this goal is impossible to achieve away 
from Syria and its views. No settlement can survive unless it 
is just and comprehensive, ends the causes of injustice and 
aggression, and restores rights to their legitimate owners. 
President Hafiz al-Asad is the person who proposed this theory 
and who has borne the burden of convincing the world of it. He 
has succeeded, and thus provided the objective means for the 
Madrid conference and opened the door for the possibility of 
achieving real peace in the region. 
  TISHRIN also highlights the media capabilities mobilized by 
Zionism to disturb the atmosphere of the upcoming summit between 
Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. The paper points out that 
Zionism spared Syria no false accusations and also practiced all 
kinds of blackmail and intimidation against the U.S. 
Administration. 
  TISHRIN concludes: We hope that the summit will succeed and 
achieve its objectives and fulfill the great hopes pinned on it 
by reviving the march of a comprehensive settlement and 
achieving a just and lasting peace in the region that would end 
occupation and restore usurped Arab rights. Syria has made, and 
will continue to make, positive contributions toward this end. 
  Commenting on the importance of supporting Syria's stands, 
AL-BA'TH says: The Damascus Declaration foreign ministers were 
very clear when they asserted that a unified Arab position is 
what enables the nation to restore all of its rights in 
accordance with UN resolutions. 
  The paper notes that the meetings of the Damascus 
Declaration 
foreign ministers over the past two days have paid special 
attention to the importance of the upcoming summit between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton under the current 
circumstances. 
  The paper says that the Damascus Declaration foreign 
ministers did not forget to stress Syria's important, vital role 
in ensuring the success of the peace process. They affirmed 
their countries' support for President Hafiz al-Asad, who is 
maneuvering the ship while demonstrating rare courage and wisdom. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: It is very important for Syria to go to 
the Geneva summit while standing on firm ground and having the 
support of all its Arab brothers in order to achieve a just, 
comprehensive peace that restores Arab rights in full, keeps 
harm out of their way, and thus provides them with strength and 
impregnability.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The Damascus Meeting...Toward 
Further Coordination," the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: The 
Damascus meeting, which comes a few days before the expected 
summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton, will provide a 
new opportunity for Arab coordination and consultation 
concerning the peace process and its developments, and give the 
Arab situation additional strength, especially since leader 
al-Asad will leave for Geneva as a representative of the Arab 
nation which seeks to restore its full cultural role in this 
world. The Arab nation stood fast and struggled in defense of 
its honorable, free existence, and refused, proudly and loftily, 
to capitulate to its enemies, through wise stands leader al-Asad 
has embodied in sound, unmistakable decisions. 
  AL-BA'TH notes: The topics the Damascus Declaration member 
states' foreign ministers will discuss are comprehensive and 
versatile and in the interest of pan-Arab issues that must not 
be relinquished. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: At the time of international changes and the 
economic blocs it has produced and whose objective is to control 
world economy, the Arabs have no choice but to unify ranks in 
order to pave the way for establishing the most important bloc, 
taking into consideration the Arab world's location and 
resources. 
  AL-BA'TH says: Our call for establishing a bloc is not based 
on hostility to or confrontation with anyone, but on the 
principle of defending our livelihood and providing the best 
living conditions for a nation that, throughout its history, has 
been the nation of generosity and kindness. 
  Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Frankly speaking, we call for 
further coordination, consultation, and unity. This is because 
joint Arab action contains abundant benefits for the masses of 
our nation which, everyday, hear about new world blocs, while it 
can do nothing. Based on this, the Damascus meeting is of 
special importance, particularly, considering the positive 
results it will produce, and which will be in the interest of 
all Arabs. 
  The newspaper TISHRIN comments on the meetings of the 
Damascus Declaration member states' foreign ministers. It says: 
It is not a coincidence that the Damascus Declaration member 
states' foreign ministers meet to discuss ways to implement the 
declaration, taking into consideration that Syria is the country 
of all Arabs, the vanguard of pan-Arab solidarity, and the 
supporter of everyone who has been exposed to a spiteful 
aggression. The Kuwaiti brothers have realized Syria's concern 
about adhering to right and its readiness to confront falsehood. 
  TISHRIN adds: The Damascus Declaration should have been 
implemented long ago, especially since it lays the foundations 
for an entrenched and genuine Arab solidarity based on a host of 
pan-Arab principles. All Arabs are aware of the fact that the 
absence of Arab solidarity and some sides' deviation from the 
bases of this solidarity have led the region to two 
catastrophes: The first was the Iraq-Iran war which exhausted 
the resources of Iraq, Iran, and the region's states. The 
second was the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait which led to more 
serious results, not only the exhausted resources and 
capabilities, but also concerning the West's attempts to 
reimpose its hegemony over the region and to control oil prices. 
  TISHRIN says: In light of this tragic situation, there 
should have been a real solidarity that put things on their 
right course, entrenches the principles of pan-Arab action, 
fraternal relations, and genuine traditions, and confronts all 
those who tamper with the nation's fate and give predominance to 
their parochial interests and crazy whims over the Arabs' higher 
interests. However, the declaration remained only ink on paper, 
and the economy and foreign ministers held meetings which 
produced nothing although none of the signatories rejected or 
renounced the declaration. The Gulf states affirmed their 
adherence to the declaration, and Syria and Egypt expressed 
their readiness to fulfill their obligations and to give 
anything required of them. 
  TISHRIN clarifies: Arab security is an indivisible whole, 
and Gulf security is part of Arab security. No one can 
guarantee Arab security other than the Arabs themselves. 
  TISHRIN adds: In all their countries, the Arabs are looking 
forward to implementing the Damascus Declaration and to adopting 
Arab solidarity as a tangible and genuine principle. Things are 
changing rapidly and the entire Arab region has new obligations 
to fulfill. The current Arab fragmentation weakens the Arab 
cause. In fact, some have deviated from solidarity and 
concluded a deal with Israel, which harmed the Palestinian 
people and the region. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: It has been said that the Arabs' 
strength lies in their unity and solidarity. Only through unity 
and solidarity can territories and holy places be restored. 
Syria has called and is calling on the Arabs to rise up to the 
level of pan-Arab responsibility. All Arabs can win through 
their solidarity, and lose through their fragmentation.

  [Text] Beirut, 11 Jan (MENA)--The lightning visit made by a 
delegation of U.S. Congress employees to western al-Biqa' in 
Lebanon as part of a mission to collect information on the fate 
of Israeli soldiers who went missing during the 1982 Israeli 
invasion has provoked broad controversy in Lebanese political 
quarters. 
  The U.S. delegation arrived in western al-Biqa' in south 
Lebanon across the border from Syria and carried out a four-hour 
field tour of several villages before returning to Syria. 
  Some Lebanese newspapers have criticized the visit. The 
Lebanese newspaper AL-DIYAR, mouthpiece of the Syrian Social 
Nationalist Party, said the visit has created a diplomatic 
crisis-like atmosphere between Lebanon and the United States. 
  AL-DIYAR said diplomatic sources in the Lebanese Foreign 
Ministry have not concealed their astonishment at the way the 
visit took place without official quarters being informed, 
especially the Foreign Ministry, and without any meeting being 
sought with any Lebanese official to explain the delegation's 
mission.

  [Text] In its session yesterday, the Council of Ministers 
concluded discussing diplomatic appointments but did not 
announce the names publicly. This is in line with international 
norms, which stipulate informing the concerned countries first 
of the ambassadors appointed to them. All ministers refused to 
release any information on diplomatic appointments. They agreed 
that the Council of Ministers decided in its session yesterday 
to issue a decree that its decisions should be considered as 
secret. They clarified that the Council decided to add a 
paragraph to the fourth item of Decree Number 2552 issued on 1 
August 1992 to make the text read: 
  While considering the clauses of Article 17 of the decree, 
the Council of Ministers' agenda will be considered a secret 
document. And the discussions and deliberations of the Council 
of Ministers will also be considered secret. They cannot be 
published or publicized. 
  The media referred to a turbulent start to the Council 
session. Minister Fattush said he believed that the request to 
make the discussions secret kills political life. When 
President al-Hirawi put the issue of adopting secrecy to a vote, 
the Council of Ministers approved it with a majority of 26. 
Three ministers objected: Sulayman Franjiyah, Nicholas 
Fattush, and Hasan 'Izz-al- Din.

  [Text] The prime minister said the country is well on its 
way to steady economic progress. Addressing a meeting at 
Trichur in Kerala, Mr. Narasimha Rao said that the country's 
secular foundation faced the gravest challenges from communal 
forces in recent times but they have come under effective 
control now. He called for a massive public cooperation to 
consolidate the achievement. Mr. Rao reiterated that a 
polarization has started in Indian politics with the secular 
forces on one side and the communal and casteist elements on the 
other. Referring to Punjab, the prime minister said terrorism 
has come to an end finally with the cooperation of the people. 
On Kashmir, he said the center is hopeful of restarting the 
democratic process very soon. 
  Earlier, inaugurating the valedictory function of the 
platinum jubilee celebration of the local St. Thomas College, 
Mr. Narasimha Rao said the nation is well set to attain secular 
democracy despite impediments. He said secularism is the 
lifeblood of the nation.

  [Excerpt] The prime minister says that in the changed 
international situation, India and China have a bigger role to 
play to ensure peace and stability. Speaking to a delegation of 
the Chinese Communist Party which called on him in New Delhi 
today, Mr. Narasimha Rao expressed satisfaction over the steady 
growth of bilateral relations. The prime minister also extended 
an invitation to the Chinese president to visit later this year. 
The delegation is led by Mr. Wen Jiabao, member of the 
Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist 
Party. According to the Congress-I spokesman, Mr. Chandulal 
Chandrakar, the delegation called for greater cooperation 
between India and China in agriculture, science and technology, 
rural development, industry and culture. It also emphasized the 
need for more interaction between the Congress-I and the Chinese 
Communist Party. The delegation earlier called on the home 
minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan. The minister reiterated the 
government's commitment to maintain friendly relations with 
China and peace and tranquillity along the border. [passage

<F P=106> [By M.K. Dhar] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 1 -- China has reportedly given 
Pakistan a firm assurance about continuity of arms supplies in 
future, even though Premier Benazir Bhutto failed to persuade 
its leadership to finalise a Sino-Pak military pact aimed 
primarily against India. 
  As a follow-up of the credit agreement signed between the 
two 
countries recently to finance arms purchases, Chinese and 
Pakistani defence officials will conduct negotiations on the 
items Islamabad is looking for and the delivery schedules, from 
Beijing. The two countries have a longstanding defence 
relationship, including in the nuclear field, and China has 
emerged as Pakistan's major arms supplier. 
  After having launched a low intensity war against India 
through sponsorship of terrorism, Pakistan has been trying its 
utmost to involve China in a formal security relationship which 
could deter India from attacking Pakistan, even if the level of 
interference in its internal affairs became extremely grave and 
unbearable. 
  The subject was broached by former Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif also with Chinese Premier Li Peng several times during 
his Beijing visits, as also Mr. Peng's Islamabad journey in 
1989. But China, which has accorded top priority to 
establishing good neighbourly relations with the countries 
bordering on it, has refused to get involved in any security 
arrangement. 
  When Ms. Benazir Bhutto raised the issue with Mr. Peng in 
Beijing early this week, she was reportedly told that, at a time 
when the international situation was marked by turbulence, 
Asia-Pacific was the only region achieving rapid economic growth 
and perceptible political stability. China's moves to establish 
closer political, economic and cultural ties with these 
countries and, principally its neighbours, had helped promote 
regional stability and development. 
  At the same time, with the world witnessing turmoil in 
several spots -- Europe, Middle East, Africa -- and the growing 
trend towards defusion of tensions, any military pacts were 
becoming irrelevant. Even NATO had lost its focus. The Chinese 
leadership, according to diplomatic sources, laid stress on 
resolving the present, as well as, future crises among countries 
through peaceful negotiations without involving third parties, 
which would only complicate matters further. 
  Under an agreement on military cooperation signed during the 
Premiership of Mr. Z.A. Bhutto, Pakistan had assumed that the 
same would operate as a defence pact and China would 
automatically intervene on Pakistan's side whenever it chose to 
commit hostilities against India. But the Chinese have put no 
such interpretation on, nor acknowledged any defence 
obligations, under the agreement as per which considerable 
quantities of military equipment were supplied to Pakistan on 
"friendship prices". Ms. Benazir Bhutto did not succeed in 
persuading the Chinese to commit themselves to a military pact 
where Mr. Nawaz Sharif had failed many times. 
  Though China accords top priority to its relations with 
Pakistan, it is in no mood to do anything which would create 
apprehensions amongst its neighbours about its "expansionist" or 
peace-keeping role in the Asian region. Ms. Bhutto was also 
assured that China's friendship with Pakistan would not be 
affected by normalisation of relations with India with which it 
had signed an agreement recently on maintaining peace and 
tranquillity along the border. 
  The Chinese treat the relations with Islamabad as abiding, 
developed as these were in the military field first and, later, 
extended to the economic and technological (including nuclear) 
spheres. China's unwillingness to play the U.S. game of trying 
to destabilise the situation in the Asian sub-continent by 
backing one of the parties to the Kashmir dispute has been 
clearly expressed. The Chinese leaders were also lukewarm in 
responding to Ms. Bhutto's allegations of repression and 
violation of human rights in Kashmir because Beijing is accused 
precisely of the same in Tibet and also parts of China. 
  The Chinese leadership has thus adopted a correct attitude 
keeping in view Indian sensibilities, though the credits for 
arms supplies it has offered to Islamabad is causing some 
anxiety in New Delhi because Pakistan has already acquired huge 
quantities of weapons and has an on-going programme of 
cooperation in defence industries with Beijing. Sino-Pakistani 
missile cooperation started as far back as 1987-88 initially 
focusing on the sale of Chinese built M-9 ballistic missiles. 
Chinese assistance in developing Pakistan's 400 km range HATF-2 
surface-to-surface missile was confirmed in 1989, although 
information on the extent of assistance was not fully available. 
  The Chinese transfer of about 40 M-11 missiles capable of 
carrying 1100 kg warhead up to a distance of 300 miles has now 
been confirmed, though it is said that it has a shorter range of 
290 km with 800 kg payload. The M-11 is a fully mobile, 
single-stage solid propellant missile, and can be loaded and 
readied for firing in about 45 minutes. According to 
unconfirmed reports, China has on-hand contracts to sell missile 
and other related technology to the tune of nearly one billion 
U.S. dollars to Pakistan, Iran, Syria and other countries in 
West Asia. 
  The U.S. Administration has alleged that China is shipping 
components, technology and materials that directly contribute to 
a covert indigenous missile-production programme in Pakistan to 
justify its decision to impose sanctions on China and Pakistan 
under MTCR [Missile Technology Control Regime]. 
  Ms. Benazir Bhutto's visit to North Korea also assumes 
significance from the military angle, because Pyongyang had also 
been a major recipient of Chinese missiles and components as 
well as technical assistance. North Korea has been assisted by 
China in designing rocket engines and provided metallurgy and 
air-frame expertise. North Korea is now trying to develop new 
Nodong-I ballistic missile with range of 1000 km. Obviously, 
Pakistan may be trying to import missile components and related 
technology besides other equipment from North Korea which in 
turn is getting them from China. 
  China insists that it has been prudent in exporting arms and 
military technology, and says that export of weapons must help 
countries improve their defence capabilities. These should not 
harm regional peace, security and stability and the arms sales 
must not be used to interfere in the internal affairs of others. 
However, going by Pakistan's conduct since 1988 when it began 
sponsoring cross-border terrorism against India, none of the 
conditions stipulated by China on arms transfer have been 
observed.

  [Text] Foreign direct investment has crossed 1600 crore 
rupees last year. An official release in New Delhi says this 
reflects the increasing response to the new industrial policy 
and the economic reforms. The investment inflows were a meagre 
350 crores rupees during 1991. The year end review of the 
industrial scene shows that the infrastructure sector has 
achieved a near six percent growth rate. The release says the 
government has approved 37 projects proposed under the centrally 
sponsored scheme of growth centers.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Washington correspondent 'Aqiva Eldar: </F>
"Careful, Glass"] 
  [Text] Judging by the messages Yitzhaq Rabin has been 
relaying to Washington in anticipation of the Clinton-al-Asad 
summit, it is hard to tell what has him more worried: a summit 
that ends in a deep rift between the United States and Syria 
over the fate of the Middle East, or a joint statement by the 
two leaders about an understanding on the establishment of 
diplomatic relations between Syria and Israel in exchange for an 
arrangement on the Golan. 
  Whatever the case may be, the Americans are under the 
impression that Rabin is uptight about the Clinton-al-Asad 
meeting, and they have been sparing no effort to put him at 
ease. They agree with the notion that the prime minister cannot 
afford to talk about a withdrawal on the Golan while conducting 
tough negotiations about a withdrawal from Jericho and Gaza. 
  On the other hand, it is hard to envision a situation where 
the Syrian president informs Clinton that for the sake of 
normalization with the United States he is prepared to stomach 
normalization with Israel, including the opening of borders and 
embassies, and Clinton pleading with him to put off a decision 
until Rabin and 'Arafat reach an agreement. In such an event, 
Rabin and Clinton will have a problem. Rabin's problem will be 
with the Jews in Israel who are still having a hard time 
digesting the compromise in Jericho, while Clinton's will be 
with the Jews in America who were removed from the political 
agenda as a result of the Oslo agreement. 
  The very meeting with the U.S. President, who will be taking 
time off from his discussions about security in Europe, is seen 
by the Syrian president as quite a formidable achievement. 
Clinton's aides recall that three former U.S. Presidents also 
conferred with al-Asad, and that nothing could be more natural 
than a meeting with yet another regional leader taking part in 
the political process under U.S. orchestration. 
  This may very well be the way the Geneva summit appears from 
the American point of view, but al-Asad experts are sure that he 
will make it his business to depict the event in a totally 
different light. Even before shaking hands with his young 
counterpart and consoling him on the death of his mother, 
al-Asad scored important points with the Arab world. He can 
argue that all he had to do to obtain such prestigious publicity 
was to do nothing; neither to excessively obstruct the PLO in 
its negotiations with Israel, nor to demand that Arab leaders 
punish 'Arafat for deviating from their agreement to coordinate 
moves vis-a-vis Israel. He kept all options in his hands and 
did not budge from his fundamental positions, such as the demand 
for an Israeli withdrawal from all the territories. Ahmad 
Jibril, the murderer of U.S. soldiers in Berlin, is still being 
hosted in Damascus, and al-Asad makes no secret of his ties with 
Hizballah. 
  Rabin, Jewish functionaries, and U.S. officials fear that 
the 
U.S. President -- who is eager for foreign policy achievements 
-- will be tempted to buy glass beads from al-Asad and hug him 
as if they were diamonds. Al-Asad recently reminded us that the 
Americans are prepared to be grateful even for second-hand 
beads. Three times he promised to let go of the Jewish hostages 
in Damascus and Aleppo, and there are signs that he will sell 
them a fourth time, this time directly to the U.S. President. 
Clinton will then rush to talk about it in front of the U.S. 
television cameras which have a short memory. 
  The experts, led by Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, an Arabist 
and head of the Israeli delegation to the talks with Syria, are 
telling Rabin that the shrewd Syrian president will not let such 
a rare opportunity slip through his fingers next Sunday [16 
January]. The meeting with George Bush in the midst of the Gulf 
war and Syria's participation in the Madrid conference were 
prerequisites for the improvement of its relations with the 
West, but two years later these moves are deemed insufficient. 
As the Americans see it, he has not done enough when it comes 
to relations with Israel on the one hand, and with regard to 
Iran, North Korea, and terror on the other. If he concludes 
that he cannot "string along" Clinton, al-Asad may deliver the 
goods that will help the U.S. President justify the meeting and 
pave the way for more tangible changes in the future. Rabin is 
now trying to up the ante with regard to the public 
manifestation of the change in Syria's position and to make sure 
that al-Asad does not profit from the weaknesses of his U.S. 
interlocutor. 
  The prime minister should hope that Clinton arrives at the 
meeting with the Syrian president in high spirits, carrying 
positive press clippings about his talks with Boris Yeltsin, 
Leonid Kravchuk, Lech Walesa, and his NATO partners. Success in 
Europe will reduce the danger of Clinton searching for -- and 
finding -- consolation with al-Asad for his frustration in 
failing to encourage reforms in Russia, to cite just one 
example. The more the summit is depicted as a great 
achievement, the more the pressure will increase on Israel to 
pay its share for success on the Syrian track, despite the 
difficulties on the Palestinian track and at home. If it is 
real, this achievement could be used to improve positions versus 
the PLO and the Likud.

  [Text] Egypt's Ambassador to Israel Muhammad Basyuni 
predicts an understanding of principles will be signed between 
Syria and Israel by April. Basyuni spoke last night before the 
annual conference of WIZO, the Women's International Zionist 
Organization, in Tel Aviv. Reporter Dani Gur-Arye was there: 
  [Begin recording] [Gur-Arye] Ambassador Basyuni served as 
Egypt's military attache in Syria during the 1970's, and he is 
acquainted personally with President al-Asad. Basyuni says 
al-Asad is a tough negotiator, but he can be counted on to keep 
his word in any agreement signed. As an example, Basyuni cites 
the 1974 disengagement agreement between Israel and Syria: 
  [Basyuni] Since 1974, Syria kept their word, and no one 
violation of this agreement. What it means? It means if you 
sign agreement with the Syrians, they will keep it. They keep 
their words. Maybe they will be very tough in the negotiations, 
but they will keep their words after the negotiations, after 
reaching agreement. And, the case with Syria is very clear: If 
Israel will withdraw full withdrawal from Golan Heights, it will 
be full peace. 
  [Gur-Arye] Ambassador Basyuni predicts the negotiations 
between Syria and Israel will be renewed following the summit 
between President al-Asad and U.S. President Clinton next week 
in Geneva. He says 1994 will be a year of peace in the Middle 
East. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The government this evening survived a joint 
motion of no-confidence presented by Tzomet and the National 
Religious Party. Only 43 members of the house supported the 
motion, 57 opposed it, and two abstained. The debate centered 
around the statement by Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur, who 
said the current peace negotiations could lead to the 
establishment of a Palestinian state. Foreign Minister Peres 
said the government rejects the establishment of such a state 
because it opposes the presence of any foreign army west of the 
Jordan River. [passage omitted] 
  In presenting the no-confidence motion, Tzomet Knesset 
Member 
[MK] Gonen Segev said the opposition would silence itself if the 
Labor party went back to the people with a new platform. In the 
meantime, MK Segev accused the government of violating the 
current Labor platform of opposing a Palestinian state and in 
favor of holding on to the Jordan Valley. [passage omitted] 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres responded to the 
no-confidence 
motion denying any deviation from the Labor party platform. He 
said the government is not discussing a Palestinian state in the 
current negotiations, only autonomy for the Palestinians, as 
stated in the party platform. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Yerah Tal: "Now He Turns to the Skies for Help"] </F>
  [Text] Binyamin Netanyahu constantly manages to supply 
ammunition to his rivals. The latest round came last Friday [7 
January] when he launched a public relations campaign entitled 
"The Likud's Information Airline," consisting of flights from 
Tel Aviv's Sede Dov Airfield to Jericho and back to illustrate 
the security dangers looming over Israel as a result of the 
implementation of the agreement with the PLO. "Netanyahu failed 
to get the masses out on the streets, and he is now trying his 
luck in the skies," said a senior Likud member commenting on the 
campaign. "A folly," said Knesset Member Ari'el Sharon. The 
latter does not take part in the airborne campaign and will 
continue his independent public relations campaign on the 
ground. As he usually does, he will stop at the same old spot 
near the settlement of Bet Arye overlooking Ben-Gurion Airport 
and lecture his audience about the dangers posed by a 
Palestinian state. 
  Sharon brought the internal ferment against Netanyahu's 
leadership to a peak last week when he announced his plans to 
run for the premiership. Two days earlier he described 
Netanyahu as "a man who got caught with his pants down, in more 
ways than one, but put the blame on others." Not to be outdone, 
Netanyahu retorted by accusing Sharon of "relentless subversion 
which began under Menahem Begin and continued under Yitzhaq 
Shamir, and now it is my turn." Over the weekend he even went as 
far as warning that "the Likud might once again enter a 
collision course." 
  His associates say that Netanyahu will henceforth change his 
ways and fight back. "I will not agree to be the punching bag 
of frustrated Likud members, as Yitzhaq Shamir was," he told his 
associates last week as he launched his counteroffensive. His 
men accused Sharon of encouraging a group of U.S. businessmen to 
accuse Netanyahu of diverting money collected for the Council of 
Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza to the Likud's 
coffers. Sharon categorically denied it, but Netanyahu's men 
persisted. They leaked to the press that the Likud was forced 
to pay 40,000 shekels for a private information campaign Sharon 
conducted on the eve of the last Knesset election. This claim, 
too, was emphatically denied by Sharon. A journalist who 
nevertheless published it without seeking Sharon's comment was 
reprimanded after Sharon complained. 
  Netanyahu will hold his fire against the other "subversives" 
-- David Levi, David Magen, and Dan Meridor -- as long as they 
do not come out against him in public. Still, Netanyahu's men 
have already warned them "not to stoke the fire." Rumors at 
Likud headquarters in Tel Aviv have it that "Netanyahu's 
followers have compiled a dossier about each rival." Perhaps 
this is the reason why Magen refuses to be interviewed for 
Friday night's weekly newsreel on Channel 1. He asked the 
television people "to wait until February," by which time he 
will have finished gathering the data about the number of 
drop-outs from Likud ranks and exposing them to the public as 
part of his campaign to bring about new primaries. It is 
estimated that some 100,000 of the Likud's 250,000 registered 
members will have dropped out by then. 
  David Levi has adopted different tactics from that of Sharon 
and Magen, but not because he fears Netanyahu's reaction. His 
associates claim that his thundering silence is a calculated and 
well-planned move. Levi has learned from experience and is no 
longer willing to be the main opposition activist, with all 
others hiding behind him. His associates say that this time 
around Levi is waiting for others to do the job for him. 
However, most of those senior Likud members who question 
Netanyahu's leadership and sharply criticize him still prefer to 
do so off-the-record and in private meetings. 
  In the wake of the HA'ARETZ report about the secret 
contacts Magen has been holding in a bid to bring about new 
primaries in the Likud, in which Dan Meridor would run, 
Netanyahu's associates began collecting signatures against such 
a move. As was expected, Levi and Sharon did not sign it. 
Meridor and Beni Begin did, and went on to side publicly with 
Netanyahu in order to dispel reports that he had lent a hand to 
Magen's secret contacts. Some of the signatories sharply 
criticized Netanyahu in off-the-record talks, nevertheless, 
arguing that new primaries before the next Knesset elections are 
inevitable if the Likud really wants to return to power. 
  However, holding new primaries is not that simple. A clause 
Netanyahu introduced in the Likud's constitution actually 
guarantees his election as chairman of the Likud -- who also is 
its candidate for the premiership -- until the year 2000. A 
decision to hold new primaries before an elected chairman ends 
his term requires a 75-percent majority in the 3,600-member 
Likud Central Committee and such a majority would seem 
unattainable at the moment. 
  According to a poll conducted by Channel 2 over the weekend, 
Netanyahu still commands the support of 49 percent of the Likud 
(he got 52 percent in the primaries), compared with Sharon's 15 
percent, Levi's 7 percent (as opposed to 27 percent in the 
primaries), and Meridor's 7 percent. Levi's men claim that the 
poll does not reflect reality and that support for Levi is 
larger. However, they too understand that he does not yet have 
the required majority to bring about new primaries, even if his 
followers were joined by those of Sharon and Meridor. 
Nevertheless, "when the time comes," Levi's followers (and not 
just them) plan to submit a motion to the Central Committee to 
hold primaries. Their idea is to attain over 50 percent of the 
vote, and depict it as a show of no confidence in Netanyahu. As 
they see it, such a move would pressure him to agree to 
primaries. 
  At the same time, Sharon's and Levi's followers are 
examining 
alternative scenarios and are not ruling out the possibility of 
a split. A group of Levi's followers, which includes his 
brother Maxim, believes that if the peace process succeeds the 
entire political map will change, and then it will be possible 
to set up a new political movement led by David Levi which will 
focus on socioeconomic issues. Maxim recently asked his brother 
to tone down his pronouncements against the peace process so as 
not to impair the chances of such an independent movement to 
attain the support of the political mainstream. However, it 
would seem from David Levi's latest statements that he has not 
been heeding this advice. 
  Ari'el Sharon has been saying that he will not bring about 
the disbandment of the Likud, and stressing that if and when he 
decides to run for the premiership he will want to do it only in 
the framework of the Likud. At the same time, he said he had no 
idea how to go about it in view of the obstacle posed by the 
Likud constitution. His followers argue that if he fails to 
bring about new primaries in the Likud he may collect 50,000 
signatures to present his candidacy for the premiership in 
accordance with the new law. Likud members claim that through 
such a move Sharon would be driving himself out of the Likud. 
Despite Sharon's and Refa'el Eytan's denials, rumors persist in 
the political establishment about an ongoing dialogue between 
the two concerning the establishment of a new right-wing 
political movement. It has even been speculated that in such an 
event Eytan would be willing to give up running for the 
premiership and become Sharon's second-in-command. However, 
some in the Likud believe that Sharon's move was merely designed 
to neutralize Netanyahu through the creation of a collective 
leadership which would include all those who served as ministers 
in the Likud government, including David Levi. 
  Everybody agrees that developments in the Likud depend on 
the 
date of the next elections to the Knesset and the premiership. 
If Yosi Sarid's predictions come true and elections are brought 
forward either to the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995 in 
anticipation of the signing of peace agreements, Netanyahu's 
rivals stand a very slim chance of challenging the Likud's 
leadership. It is believed that in such an event a formula will 
be found to reinstate Levi in the Likud's leadership as 
Netanyahu's second-in-command, perhaps on the basis of a 
proposal consolidated by Tzahi Hanegbi and Re'uven Rivlin. If 
the elections are held on schedule in 1996, some people in the 
Likud assess that the infighting at the top will lead to a new 
contest for the leadership of the party.

<F P=106> [Report by army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe] </F>
  [Text] No date has been set yet for the evacuation of IDF 
troops from the Gaza Strip or Jericho. Not a single Army unit 
or base has been evacuated. The date will be set in accordance 
with the agreement reached by Israel and the Palestinians. 
Nonetheless, the IDF Logistics Branch has begun employing 
outside contractors and IDF teams at dozens of locations in the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho to prepare the sites for the evacuated 
IDF units on the date to be determined. It is believed, 
however, that the work will go on for several months after the 
evacuation decision is made. 
  The cost of the evacuation of Gaza and Jericho is estimated 
at some 500 million shekels. So far, an expenditure of 
approximately 230 million shekels has been approved, of which 
dozens of millions of shekels have already been spent, and this 
sum does not include the cost of works on roads, travel axes, 
and measures to protect the settlements. 
  The Army has began infrastructure work at the alternative 
site set aside for the IDF units that will be evacuated from 
Jericho. It has been learned that the site is being constructed 
southeast of Jericho, near the settlement of Mul Nevo. 
  The IDF is scheduled to complete the construction of the 
electronic fence that will surround the Gaza Strip by April 
1995. The barrier will include intrusion-tracking dirt roads, a 
paved road, an obstacle fence, and the electronic fence itself. 
The barrier will be 50 meters in width, 65 km in length, and 
will cost 100 million shekels. It has been decided that several 
contractors will work simultaneously in order to finish building 
the fence that will protect the settlements inside the Green 
Line on time. The other fence that is designed to surround the 
Qatif Bloc will be 17 km in length. It will also be an alarm 
fence, although this is not yet final. 
  [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 11 January carries a related 
report by Sharon Sade on page A3, adding that recent estimates 
drawn up by the Finance Ministry and the defense establishment 
indicate that if the evacuated troops were "to take over 
uninhabited buildings in the Gaza Strip settlements of Pe'at 
Sade and Nisanit, the IDF could save approximately 25 million 
shekels." The report adds that "the defense establishment is 
finding it hard to obtain the consent of the representatives of 
the religious settlements." According to defense establishment 
estimates, the settlement of Netzarim's refusal to allow the IDF 
to set up a post in the settlement "will result in an 
expenditure of approximately 5 million shekels on the 
construction of a separate outpost."]

  [Text] The Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip has withdrawn its support for the 
campaign to double the number of settlements in the territories 
by adding mini-settlements next to existing ones. After a joint 
meeting of the council and the campaign management, the council 
sent a letter to settlement leaders in the territories saying 
that after an in-depth review of the issue, it was decided not 
to implement the campaign because of the many problems that have 
cropped up. Our settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman 
reports that settlement leaders are concerned that a campaign in 
which dozens of outposts are set up in Judaea, Samaria, and the 
Gaza Strip will not gain public support. At the same time, 
settlement leaders are planning a campaign to locate and 
demarcate state lands in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip 
with the aid of authorized surveyors.

Director General Uri Savir, both of whom raised the importance 
of closer economic relations between the two countries and the 
issue of El Al's landing privileges in Japan. Shim'on Sheves 
told the visiting vice minister that the situation in which 
Israel buys $1 billion worth of Japanese goods, while Japan 
avoids investing in Israel, is unacceptable.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi 
yesterday said that the signing of the Middle East peace accord 
in September last year was an important milestone in the 
development of Israel. He said the historic occasion could only 
have been possible as a result of the courage and patriotism of 
the Jewish people. [passage omitted] 
  President Moi was speaking at State House, Jerusalem, in 
Israel during a state banquet hosted in his honor by President 
Ezer Weizman of Israel. President Moi noted that his visit to 
Israel marks the first visit by a Kenyan head of state since 
independence 30 years ago. [passage omitted] President Moi 
looked forward to a fruitful cooperation and friendship between 
Israel and Kenya. 
  President Weizman noted that since President Moi took over 
the leadership of Kenya, he has shown political wisdom and 
courage, thus making Kenya an island of stability and economic 
prosperity in the region. Noting that President Moi immensely 
contributed to the relations between Kenya and Israel, President 
Weizman said the visit to the Holy Land was the beginning of a 
new chapter in bilateral relations. [passage omitted] 
  President Weizman said cooperation between the two countries 
was multifaceted. He pointed out that scientists from Kenya and 
Israel were working together on agricultural research. 
President Weizman further noted that the economic relations 
between the two countries had developed to a great extent but 
added that a lot could still be done. He expressed hope that 
when peace reigns in the Middle East, Israel will be a bridge of 
cooperation between Africa as a continent and the Middle East.

  [Text] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today 
called on those countries torn by civil strife to emulate Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organization, PLO, who after more 
than four decades of war, have agreed to negotiate for a lasting 
peaceful solution. Noting that peace in the Middle East is of 
great significance to the whole world, President Moi said it was 
proved that no conflict is impossible to resolve amicably. The 
president therefore hoped that the avenues for peace that have 
so far been opened up will lead to everlasting peace in the 
Middle East. 
  President Moi at the same time called on Israeli investors 
to 
look to Kenya and East Africa as an area (?ripe) for investment 
and to join hands in partnership with the region. President Moi 
was speaking during a luncheon hosted in his honor by the 
Israeli prime minister, Mr. Yitzhaq Rabin, during his second day 
in that country. 
  On the civil strife in Somali, the president once again 
pleaded with leaders of the various factions to appreciate the 
dignity of human life and give peace a chance. He noted that 
civil strife in that country continued to have significant 
implications in neighboring countries, especially Kenya. On the 
Sudan, however, President Moi said that mediation efforts are 
being made by the member states of the Intergovernmental 
Authority on Drought and Development, IGADD, of which he is the 
chairman. The president hoped that peace will eventually return 
to southern Sudan. President Moi expressed his satisfaction at 
the development taking place in South Africa, despite the 
problems which must be overcome before final and sustainable 
harmony is achieved. 
  The president commended the Israelis for their great 
achievements in sectors of development like in agriculture, 
technology and particularly in irrigation. He observed that 
Israel faced similar problems to those facing Kenya and cited 
uncertain rains, extensive arid land and infertile soils but 
which he said had not stopped Israel from developing. He added 
that the Government of Kenya values cooperation in all aspects 
of development -- cultural, economical, political and 
technological. However, he said there was need to strengthen 
that cooperation. Later President Moi and Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin, on behalf of their governments, signed an 
agreement on culture, science and education.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today 
announced in Jerusalem that Kenya will soon open an embassy in 
Israel. He further announced the posting of a Kenyan ambassador 
to Israel will be done in the next few months. The president 
made the announcement while addressing a session of the Israeli 
parliament this afternoon in Jerusalem. 
  President Moi said that parliamentary democracy remains the 
only form of government in which the two ideals of a democratic 
society are protected. The president added that although there 
are some fundamental principles in any society such as the right 
to freedom, justice, property and protection of life, every 
society has its own specific homegrown characteristics and 
principles. He explained that it was in a mixture of these 
principles that a true democratic society could evolve. 
  Describing the Israeli parliamentary institution as one of 
the most well developed in the world, the president said those 
Kenyan members of parliament with him will no doubt learn from 
the Israeli practice of parliamentary democracy. President Moi 
said that Kenya had benefited immensely from the business 
activities of the Jewish people and companies, particularly in 
civil engineering and trade. He hoped his visit will consolidate 
those ties for the benefit of the peoples of the two countries. 
  And on the situation in this region, President Moi told the 
Israeli parliamentarians that today Kenya hosts the seventh 
largest refugee population in the world mainly from Somalia. He 
added that apart from being a strain on Kenya's limited 
resources there was also serious insecurity in many parts of the 
country as some of the refugees carry with them sophisticated 
weapons as they flee their country into Kenya. 
  The Israeli prime minister, Yitzhaq Rabin, said in a speech 
read on his behalf by the Israeli minister for foreign affairs, 
Mr. Shim'on Peres, that Kenya and Israel shared a common history 
of struggle to liberate their peoples from oppression. Mr. 
Rabin praised Kenya for the role it had played in support of 
Israel in many issues that are of interest to the country. The 
Knesset session was also addressed by the leader of the 
opposition in parliament who is also the chairman of the Likud 
party Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu. [passage omitted] 
  Other reports say that President Moi this evening held 
discussions with the leader of the opposition in Israel, Mr. 
Benjamin Netanyahu, at the King David Hotel. And later 
President Moi hosted a colorful reception at the same hotel that 
was attended by President Ezer Weizman of Israel, senior 
government officials, the leader of the opposition and members 
of the diplomatic corps. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam al-Majali Monday 
[10 January] blamed the Jordanian media for continued strains in 
relations between the Kingdom and Gulf states as well as what he 
described as "wrestling" between the government and Parliament. 
  "Unfortunately, and I say it clearly, the Jordan media play 
a 
part in not getting this relations back (with Gulf states)," Dr. 
al-Majali told reporters in response to a question about 
Arab-Arab relations. 
  "Everytime we almost get it back, a couple of articles go in 
some of the media and it becomes strained again," Dr. al-Majali 
said. 
  In response to another question about whether the government 
will work to upgrade and facilitate the institutions of 
democracy such as Parliament, Dr. al-Majali said that the media 
was also a reason behind the tension between his Cabinet and 
Parliament in an obvious reference to the gruelling confidence 
session in December. 
  "The tension was drawn by the media," the prime minister 
said, adding that an article appeared which caused tension that 
had not existed until its publication. The prime minister was 
most probably referring to comments ahead of the confidence 
session that described the newly elected deputies as "docile." 
  Asked why his government had a "tug of war over freedom of 
expression" with the Jordanian media in general, Dr. al-Majali 
said that this was not true and that he did not think there was 
tension between the two. But he added that "sometimes" the 
media "takes a little thing and they don't study it properly and 
then blow it" out of all proportions. 
  The prime minister explained that while the Kingdom's 
relations with Gulf states, and especially Saudi Arabia and 
Kuwait, were improving, they continued to face setbacks because 
of critical opinion pieces or reports in the press. 
  He said his government had received communiques from Gulf 
states protesting the criticism in the Jordanian media and are 
unconvinced that the government is not behind the reports. 
  "A couple of articles come up, the second day we get into 
trouble over them--the second day, it does not even go to the 
third," the premier added. "They think that we have control 
over the media, that we tell you what to write and what not to 
write. And you know this is not true," the premier said. 
  "We hope that the media would take this concern into 
account, 
do they want this relation to be back, then they could help it 
return rather than to stir things against it." 
  He said that while the Kingdom was gratified by the success 
of its goodwill overtures with the United Arab Emirates and 
Qatar he hoped that the same will happen with Saudi Arabia. 
  "We hope our relations with Saudi Arabia would improve," Dr. 
al-Majali said, adding that contacts between the two countries 
"are good now but have not reached the level we want." 
  "We are trying to ask the media to please stop adding oil to 
the fire," Dr. al-Majali said, adding that "nothing is going to 
change if we keep criticising them. But the situation will 
change if we meet them and talk to them." 
  Dr. al-Majali also criticised the United States and other 
Western countries for failing to facilitate reconciliation 
between Jordan and the Gulf Arab states. 
  "Western countries, including the united States, have not 
been doing enough to mend Jordan's relations with other Arabs," 
Dr. al-Majali said. 
  "We know that Egypt is trying its best," he said. "But the 
West is not, and I do not know whether that is because of a bad 
feeling about what has taken place during the Gulf war."

  [Text] Palestinian chief negotiator Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi 
said he would not lead the Palestinian team to the next round of 
Middle East peace talks because he did not support the 
Israeli-PLO pact. 
  'Abd-al-Shafi told Reuter television that he had decided, 
right from the beginning, to distance himself from having any 
role in the deal. He said this was his final decision. 
  'Abd-al-Shafi made the remarks shortly after arriving in 
Amman from Tunis where he pressed Palestine President Yasir 
'Arafat for reforms. 
  The Gaza doctor, who is now spearheading Palestinian efforts 
to curb 'Arafat's power and introduce democratic reforms in the 
PLO, said he told the president of the mood of the people. 
  [Begin 'Abd-al-Shafi recording] We wanted, first of all, to 
make Chairman 'Arafat aware of the needs of the situation, and I 
think we did that very well. We made him aware of the mood of 
the people, of what do we expect, and certainly, I mean, in 
terms of reform, it is mainly the democratic practice within the 
PLO organizations. [end recording] 
  Tonight, Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi headed a meeting of Palestinian 
reformists at the Palestine National Council offices in Amman. 
He briefed them on his visit and talks in Tunis and the PLO 
leadership's response. He said the PLO had asked him to contact 
the opposition inside and outside the occupied territories to 
begin a national dialogue on reform.

  [Text] The Palestinian ambassador in Amman, al-Tayyib 
'Abd-al-Rahim, was asked by our correspondent Salim 'Ali Dhiyab 
for his reaction to the re-forming of the Royal Commission for 
Jerusalem Affairs and the signing of the Jordanian-Palestinian 
agreement. 
  [Begin recording] ['Abd-al-Rahim] For us, the agreement is 
a major accomplishment that would serve to consolidate our 
national and pan-Arab identities. The agreement virtually 
strengthens us with a shield, and that is brotherly Jordan. It 
will help us build an infrastructure for our coming national 
entity. 
  [Dhiyab] Yesterday, the Royal Commission for Jerusalem 
Affairs was reactivated and renamed, assuming an Arab and 
Islamic dimension, as well as the local one. 
  ['Abd-al-Rahim] We want to see the Jerusalem Committee firm 
up the Arab presence in Jerusalem and counter attempts to 
suppress that presence so that, when the final stage of a 
settlement comes, we will be talking about real and identifiable 
Arab features that have withstood Israel's attempts to erase the 
Arab civilization in Jerusalem. The joint Jordanian-Palestinian 
committees are to meet in the near future and build on the 
economic agreement. 
  [Dhiyab] Mr. Ambassador: Have you had any reaction from 
inside the occupied territory? 
  ['Abd-al-Rahim] Absolutely. Our people in the occupied 
territory are quite happy with this agreement. As you know, our 
people there are linked to our brother Jordanian people with 
close bonds. Whatever pleases the Jordanian people will please 
them there. I can't see a separation of the two peoples. Our 
people in the occupied land are just as happy with the agreement 
as our brother Jordanians. I had congratulations from large 
sections of our people -- organizations, trade unions, and other 
institutions -- calling for a further reinforcement of this 
distinguished relationship, sponsored by His Majesty King Husayn 
and brother Yasir 'Arafat. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordanian banks which used to have branches 
in the occupied West Bank prior to 1967 will be allowed to 
reopen one branch each in the next two months, Information 
Minister Jawad al-'Anani said Sunday [9 January]. 
  Dr. al-'Anani, a Jordanian strategist in Middle East peace 
talks who played a key role in finalising an economic 
cooperation agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organisation 
on Friday, said opening of new banks would be considered after 
giving priority to those which had branches in the occupied West 
Bank on June 4, 1967--one day before the war started. 
  Eight Jordanian banks had 31 branches in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip when Israel occupied the territories. Those in the 
West Bank followed Jordanian laws. All banks in the Gaza Strip, 
including two branches of two Jordanian banks, were governed by 
Egyptian regulations. 
  Cairo-Amman Bank reopened in 1986 under a special 
arrangement, but it had to curtail its branches' activities 
mainly to money changing because of Israeli regulations. 
  Palestinians could not get loans from the bank for two 
reasons: first: the bank had to deposit 110 per cent of the 
loan amount with the bank of Israel and second, the Palestinians 
were reluctant to mortgage their land as collateral for fear of 
seizures by the bank and the eventuality that an Israeli might 
end up as the ultimate buyer of the land. 
  The accord finalised Friday after three days of talks sets 
out a broad framework for Jordanian-Palestinian cooperation. 
Among other things, it clears the way for Jordan to implement a 
memorandum of understanding it signed with Israel on Dec. 1 on 
reopening the bank branches. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said priority would also be given to banks 
applying to reopen branches in Jericho and the Gaza Strip in 
view of a request made by the Palestinian negotiators. 
  The West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip are 
expected 
to be transferred to limited Palestinian self-rule authority in 
line with the Sept. 13 autonomy agreement between Israel and the 
PLO. 
  The main base of the self-rule authority is expected to be 
located in Jericho. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said CBJ regulations would be applicable to 
banks in the West Bank as well as the Gaza Strip. The memo 
signed with Israel on Dec. 1 provides for reopening the branches 
in the West Bank and, as officials said later, Jordan had to 
work out a separate accord on the Gaza Strip. 
  Under the memo, the Bank of Israel will issue a token 
approval for the banks already licensed by the Central Bank of 
Jordan (CBJ). The obligations of the reopened branches to the 
Bank of Israel will be limited to sending a periodic report on 
their activities. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said the permission to reopen one branch each 
will be followed by permissions for others. But in the 
beginning, each of the banks will be allowed to open only one 
branch. 
  A joint Jordanian-Palestinian technical committee will work 
under the guidance of the CBJ in processing the reopening of the 
branches. 
  The joint panel will also set monetary policies aimed at 
protecting and maintaining the stability of the Jordanian dinar. 
  The seven branches that the Cairo-Amman Bank operates in the 
occupied territories now would also be brought under total CBJ 
control, after ending the 1986 arrangement, Dr. al-'Anani said. 
  Dr. al-'Anani noted that the economic agreement also 
provides 
for the use of other currencies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
but that it excludes the Israeli shekel. 
  Israel said that the shekel would have to remain in 
circulation in the autonomous territory; palestinian officials 
say that it would be impossible to eliminate the shekel 
altogether from the occupied lands during the interim period, 
particularly that tens of thousands of Palestinians would 
continue to be employed in Israel and be paid in the Israeli 
currency. 
  Israeli officials have suggested that the Palestinians could 
issue a currency similar to the Scotish pound. Although issued 
by Scotland as a sign of Scotish identity, the currency remains 
under the control of the bank of England. 
  The Egyptian pound, which was in force in the Gaza Strip 
until Israel seized the costal strip from Egypt in the 1967 war, 
will be among the currencies in circulation. 
  The pound is sparingly used in the Gaza Strip now. According 
to reports, only Gazans wishing to travel to Egypt across the 
Rafah border buys Egyptian pounds for use in Egyptian territory. 
  According to PLO sources, the use of Egyptian pounds in the 
autonomous territories is part of commitments that PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat has made to Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, with 
whom he has stepped up coordination. 
  Mr. 'Arafat, who seems to have abandoned for the moment the 
idea of issuing a Palestinian currency during the interim 
period, also reportedly sees the use of more than one Arab 
currency in the autonomous territory as a symbol of Palestinian 
links with the Arabs while asserting Palestinian independence.

  [Excerpts] Amman -- Central Bank of Jordan [CBJ] Governor 
Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-Nabulsi has once again categorically 
denied that the Jordanian dinar will be devalued. He said that 
there are certain quarters inside and outside Jordan that like 
to spread rumors on the dinar's rate of exchange for various 
reasons. He recalled that the 1989 devaluation should be viewed 
as an isolated incident in over 40 years. 
  Speaking to AL-DUSTUR yesterday through the "Face the Press" 
rubric, Dr. al-Nabulsi said the increase in the U.S. dollar's 
exchange rate against the Jordanian dinar over the past three 
months was caused by the large increase in the dollar's rate of 
exchange against the other major currencies in the world. He 
denied that there is a policy to gradually devalue the dinar 
against the U.S. dollar. [passage omitted] 
  On the Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement that was 
signed on Friday, and its provisions on the reopening of the 
banks that were closed in the occupied Palestinian cities, Dr. 
al-Nabulsi said that the CBJ has asked the concerned banks to 
submit new applications to the CBJ for reopening their branches 
there. He emphasized that the CBJ is now waiting for the green 
light from the council of ministers to start implementing this 
provision of the agreement and to make the necessary 
arrangements for this. He said that the Israeli side promised 
to facilitate the tasks of the inspectors and controllers from 
the CBJ who will be charged with supervising the branches of the 
Jordanian banks there. 
  Dr. al-Nabulsi explained that the Jordanian-Israeli economic 
agreement stipulates the opening of bank branches in two stages; 
the first, for the banks that had branches there and were closed 
in June 1967, and the second for the banks that will open new 
branches there. At the present time, the Jordanian-Palestinian 
agreement covers only those banks that had branches there 
before. He added: However, all these things will be discussed 
and followed up through the joint committee that the agreement 
created. He said that the reopening of the previously closed 
bank branches will take place gradually. He said that the first 
thing to do is to discuss how many branches each bank will be 
allowed to open. He said eight Jordanian banks had 31 branches 
in the Palestinian cities. He said that Jordan, the 
Palestinians, and Israel should approve the reopening of any 
branch. 
  On the Kingdom's currency reserves, Dr. al-Nabulsi said that 
they are constantly increasing. These reserves dropped 
momentarily last year when Jordan recovered a large part of its 
foreign debt. He said: We paid the price of $400 million to 
purchase foreign debts worth more than $1.5 billion. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has said that the Hashemite 
Jordanian position on the Palestine question in general, and the 
issue of Jerusalem in particular, has been an honorable one 
based on enlightened principles of right and justice free of 
delusion and ambiguity and incapable of change or alteration. 
He added: Jerusalem is Arab and Islamic; its covenant is 
'Umarite [a pledge Caliph 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab gave to 
Christians when he entered Jerusalem]; and its safeguard is 
Hashemite and is based on the determination of Husayn Bin-'Ali, 
who is buried there, and the vision of 'Abdallah Bin-al-Husayn, 
its martyr. It is along their path that we are marching. 
  In a letter to Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, 
ordering the re-formation of the Royal Committee for Jerusalem 
Affairs under the chairmanship of His Highness Crown Prince 
Hasan, his majesty the king added: On the blessed occasion of 
al-Isra' and al-Mi'raj [Prophet Muhammad's midnight journey from 
Mecca to Jerusalem and his ascension to heaven], we redouble our 
faith in the value of holy shrines and Jerusalem--this immortal 
city which has recently been witnessing a difficult and 
complicated situation and is facing an ambiguous destiny, 
something that underscores our duty toward it. It is dear to us 
and lies deep into our hearts. We feel that any Arab or Islamic 
relinquishment regarding it will be recorded in history with 
pain and regret. 
  His Majesty King Husayn said: In order for the committee to 
shoulder its noble responsibilities, achieve its lofty aims, and 
follow up every affair related to Jerusalem and the holy shrines 
in the religious, historical, political, cultural, information, 
and legal domains, we order that the Royal Committee for 
Jerusalem Affairs be re-formed under the chairmanship of my dear 
brother His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan and the membership 
of the following: His Excellency Field Marshal 'Abd-al-Rahman 
Siwar al-Dhahab, His Excellency Ahmad al-Talib al-Ibrahimi, His 
Eminence Shaykh Ahmad al-Khalil, His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad 
al-Mukhtar al-Salami, His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Taqiy-al-Din 
al-'Uthmani, His Eminence Dr. Fadil al-Husayn al-Jilani, His 
Eminence Shaykh Isma'il Bin-'Ali al-Akwa', His Excellency Dr. 
'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Duri, his excellency the minister of 
information, his eminence the chief justice, His excellency the 
minister of awqaf and Islamic affairs, his excellency the 
minister of state for foreign affairs, His Excellency Dr. Hazim 
Nusaybah, His Excellency 'Abdallah Salah, His Excellency Dr. 
Jamal Nasir, His Excellency Dr. Kamil Abu-Jabir, His Excellency 
Dr. Nasir-al-Din al-Asad, Bishop Salim al-Sa'igh, Bishop Samir 
Qaf'iti, His Excellency Dr. Muhammad 'Adnan al-Bakhit, Father 
Qustantin Qarmash, and His Excellency 'Awn al-Khasawinah. 
  His Majesty King Husayn had earlier sent a letter to Akram 
Zu'aytir, expressing his profound thanks and appreciation for 
him and for the [former] members of the Royal Committee for 
Jerusalem Affairs.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sigh of Relief"] </F>
  [Text] The minister of Information, Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, 
put it appropriately yesterday, after the signing of the 
Jordanian-PLO economic agreement, when he said that the accord 
would be comforting for the two peoples in Jordan and Palestine. 
Indeed the seemingly tense atmosphere that characterised the 
otherwise warm relations between the leaderships of Jordan and 
Palestine was disturbing for people on both sides of the Jordan 
River. 
  A majority of Jordanians and Palestinians supported the 
start 
of the peace talks in Madrid in 1991. They saw in Jordan 
providing an umbrella for the Palestinian side a good omen and a 
strong indication at the depth of ties between the two peoples. 
Then, and thanks to the persistence of Palestinian negotiators 
and the skill of the Jordanian team led by Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali, it was possible for the Palestinians to wrest from 
the Israelis recognition of their status as an independent team. 
  Then the Palestinians and the Israelis arrived at their 
declaration of principles in secret talks in Oslo. That took 
Jordanians and everybody else by surprise. Yet Jordan chose, 
after absorbing the shock, to declare its full support for the 
agreement and for the Palestinian negotiators. And one day 
after the historic accord was signed between PLO and Israel in 
Washington on Sept. 13, Jordan went ahead and signed its own 
agenda for the peace talks that was otherwise ready long before 
but waiting for progress on the Palestinian track. 
  Unfortunately, the Palestinian brothers were so submerged in 
their bargaining with the Israelis that they relegated their 
coordination with the Jordanians. Jordan, of course, would not 
have protested had it not been for the fact that every aspect of 
negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis would, one way or 
the other, affect Jordan. Hence, His Majesty King Husayn's 
warning last week: Coordinate or else let each of us go his own 
way. 
  Whether that warning was behind the sending its negotiating 
team to Amman on Wednesday is besides the point. What has 
apparently transpired is a comprehensive agreement between the 
two sides on most of the issues affecting their negotiations 
with Israel and understanding to hold more frequent coordination 
talks between them. 
  Now that the two sides have settled the dispute, people in 
Jordan and the occupied territories can focus their efforts on 
the means to strengthening peace prospects. Meanwhile, the two 
sides need to keep the momentum and work together for the good 
of their peoples.

  [Text] We receive the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement with 
much optimism, hope, and confidence in the future. We also look 
forward to further clear and strong relations based on 
confidence and cooperation between two peoples who have the same 
aspirations, objectives, and march. This march is embodied in 
unbreakable ties linking our kinsfolk on the eastern and western 
sides of the River [Jordan]. 
  The success that has been achieved comes to crown and 
respond 
to His Majesty King Husayn's directives, calls, and wise views 
regarding the need to establish clear, firm, and serious 
Jordanian-Palestinian relations. It also comes as a response to 
King Husayn's eagerness that bilateral coordination should 
actually be entrenched on the ground and not on paper, and that 
the sons of our one people should feel both the results and 
positive aspects of this agreement in their practical daily life 
and not in words and wishes. 
  The current formula of this agreement affirms that the 
Jordanian and Palestinian leaderships wish to outline the 
features of joint cooperation in the face of developments, and 
that they also want to confront the challenges and dangers of 
this phase. This agreement fulfills our masses' aspirations for 
preserving the elements of their existence and safeguarding a 
free future and a decent life for their generations. Such a 
life would put the interests of Jordanians and Palestinians 
within a bilateral framework and give them a pan-Arab dimension 
away from the Israeli attempts to control the destinies of the 
two peoples and confiscate the free and independent Palestinian 
decisionmaking. 
  The common interest of both peoples requires circumventing 
all the residues and repercussions of the previous phase. It 
also requires removing the seeds of doubt and mistrust which the 
Israelis are trying to plant in a clear Arab soil. This fact, 
whose political and economic dimensions were affirmed by His 
Majesty King Husayn last week, has imposed itself on the 
atmosphere of the talks and disappointed all those who wagered 
on the inability of both sides to overcome obstacles. It has 
also disappointed those who believed that bilateral dialogue and 
interpretations would develop into a state of estrangement and 
differences, so they would realize their dreams, ambitions, and 
conspiracies. 
  The Jordanian-Palestinian agreement--along with the economic 
and financial cooperation issues it addresses--constitutes a 
step on a long path. However, it is a large and serious step 
and is part of a larger framework which would pave the way for 
agreement on all issues that are being raised and that concern 
the supreme interests of both sides such as Jerusalem, the 
refugees and displaced people, water, borders, and security in a 
spirit of joint responsibility and concern for the principles of 
coordination, solidarity, and cohesion in the battle of peace in 
order to regain both the occupied territories and the usurped 
rights. 
  The Jordanian leadership and people have always stood 
alongside the Palestinian brothers in their just and legitimate 
struggle to regain their territories, rights, sovereignty over 
their national soil, and free self-determination. Moreover, 
King Husayn's affirmations of continued adherence to this 
pan-Arab principle as part of Jordan's policy on the Palestine 
question will increase confidence that the march will proceed. 
This is because the agreement greatly embodies the fateful 
solidarity which links Jordan and Palestine. This solidarity 
also prompts the sons of our one people to champion the brothers 
and kinsfolk in the occupied territories and holy Jerusalem. 
The agreement also increases confidence that this cohesive 
march will continue and be enhanced despite all obstacles, 
challenges, and pressures on various levels and in all fields. 
It is hoped that the framework of this march will expand under 
a more comprehensive Arab coordination and on all fronts of 
confrontation with the enemy as part of the battle for peace and 
survival.

  [Text] Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah, Omani minister of 
state for foreign affairs, left Amman for Damascus today after a 
two-day visit to Jordan. During his visit he met with His 
Majesty King Husayn and several senior Jordanian officials. 
Details are in the following report: 
  In a press statement prior to his departure, the Omani 
minister said that he was honored to have been received by His 
Majesty King Husayn. He added that he relayed an oral message 
from His Majesty Sultan Qabus to his majesty the king on issues 
of common interest and current Arab issues. He went on to say 
that he listened to a detailed explanation from His Majesty King 
Husayn on various pan-Arab issues, as well as Jordan's prominent 
role in aiding the peace process. The Omani minister continued: 
The remarks that I have heard from His Majesty King Husayn 
regarding the Jordanian perspective toward the future of this 
region, as well his eagerness to promote Arab interests within 
the context of peace were heartening. He noted that he met this 
morning with Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for 
foreign affairs. This was a continuation of the talks I held 
with his majesty the king yesterday. Both sides agreed to 
identify a mechanism for coordination on various political 
issues that concern the two fraternal countries, he said. He 
noted that a joint committee has been formed to follow up on all 
bilateral trade and economic issues. He hoped that the desire of 
His Majesty King Husayn and His Majesty Sultan Qabus to seize 
all possible opportunities to promote bilateral ties will be 
realized. 
  In reply to a question on the efforts made by the Sultanate 
of Oman to achieve inter-Arab reconciliation, the minister said: 
Just like all fraternal Arabs, we look forward to see the Arabs 
identify a common ground for inter-Arab action and Arab 
solidarity. I believe that the circumstances now are more 
opportune for achieving this goal than they were in the past. 
He added: We support and back the efforts and endeavors made 
by the Arab League secretary general to achieve something along 
the road of joint Arab action and Arab solidarity. 
  When asked about the United Arab Emirates [UAE]-Iran dispute 
on the three islands, Bin-'Alawi said: I can say that the 
UAE-Iranian dispute has continued to be discussed by the two 
countries in the hope of reaching a peaceful settlement. As for 
the UAE brothers, they have consistently said that they want to 
see this dispute resolved peacefully within the context of 
legitimate rights. I believe that Iran is demonstrating a 
favorable response in this regard. I hope that future 
developments will yield a solution to this dispute. 
  On the Omani minister's visit, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, 
minister of state for foreign affairs, said that His Majesty 
King Husayn has met with the guest minister. The meeting was 
cordial and fraternal. The talks focused on issues of common 
interest, including fraternal bilateral ties, the peace process, 
as well as the ways and means of fostering these issues. 
  Al-Hasan added: This morning, the talks were resumed. They 
focused on the means of promoting and enhancing bilateral 
economic and trade ties within the context of the Joint 
Jordanian-Omani Committee. We agreed on the need to continue 
these consultations and this coordination in the interest of the 
Arab nation. 
  The guest minister was seen off by the minister of state for 
foreign affairs, the Foreign Ministry's secretary general, the 
Omani ambassador in Amman, and several senior officials.

<F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi 
Fukuda arrived here Sunday [9 January] on a four-day visit as 
part of a Middle East tour aimed at exchanging views with the 
region's leaders on the peace process. 
  Mr. Fukuda, who travelled overland to Jordan from Israel 
through the West Bank across the King Husayn Bridge, is 
scheduled to be received by Prime Minister 'Abd al-Salam 
al-Majali on Monday. 
  A diplomatic source said Mr. Fukuda's visit was prompted by 
"rapid developments in the Middle East peace process." 
  Describing the visit as very important, the source said: 
"Japan is closely following up all events in the peace process 
and likes to have a regular exchange of views of all parties 
involved in the peace negotiations." 
  Mr. Fukuda, who leaves Jordan on Jan. 13, already met with 
Israeli officials in occupied Jerusalem, where he began his 
visit. 
  He will also visit Syria and Egypt. 
  The Japanese minister, who is paying his first visit to the 
Middle East after assuming office, is closely involved in his 
country's role in the multilateral phase of the peace process. 
  Japan chairs the multilateral working group on the 
environment and is an active member of the working group on 
water. 
  Mr. Fukuda's visit to the region follows a recent meeting in 
Tokyo of the steering committee of the multilateral groups. 
  The Japanese minister will also be discussing 
Jordanian-Japanese relations and follow up on the recent visit 
to Japan by Prime Minister al-Majali. 
  During the visit, Japanese leaders, including Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, voiced appreciation of Jordan's active 
participation in the peace process and reaffirmed their 
government's commitment to helping the Kingdom address its 
economic concerns. 
  Also expected to be reviewed during Mr. Fukuda's visit is an 
$80 million Japanese loan to help develop Jordan's energy sector. 
  The loan, which will match a similar loan from the World 
Bank 
that Jordan has already received, could be merged into a $150 
million soft-credit for Jordan under consideration by the Tokyo 
government. The credit will finance the expansion of the 
al-Aqabah Thermal Power Plant. 
  Japan, which holds around $900 million of Jordan's foreign 
debts of $6.88 million, has promised to help Jordan alleviate 
its external debt burden through rescheduling arrangements. 
  In principle, Japan opposes debt write-off and advocates 
"help for those who help themselves." Japanese officials have 
expressed appreciation of the measures adopted by Jordan and say 
that such policies are behind the continued Japanese interest in 
extending aid to the Kingdom. 
  Jordan is expected to receive between $30 million and $40 
million in Japanese aid during 1994, officials said shortly 
after Dr. al-Majali's visit to Japan last month. 
  Japan, which grew from the ashes of its economy after the 
war 
to become one of the top international aid donors, insists that 
aid recipients depend on themselves to develop their economies 
and repay foreign debts in the long term rather than seeking 
debt relief in the form of write-off. 
  The bulk of Jordan's dues to Japan (up to $800 million) is 
in 
the form of soft loans with one per cent annual interest and 
repayable in 30 years. The loans were mostly extended shortly 
after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and aimed at 
helping Jordan absorb its economic losses from the crisis 
sparked by the invasion. 
  Jordan does not qualify for outright Japanese grants since 
Tokyo continues to follow an international convention which 
allows assistance to be given to countries with less than $800 
per capita income. Jordan's per capita income was $1.020 in 
1992.

  [Text] Prime Minister John Major: Accept my regards and 
those of all members of the government. We thank you, your 
government, and the British people for the humanitarian aid you 
have extended to the Kurdish people in Iraq. 
  Your envoy, Lord Jeffrey Archer, has read the text of the 
message you sent to us in the Kurdistan Parliament. The 
measures taken by your government for the survival of the 
Kurdish people and to ease their suffering have been extremely 
helpful. [words indistinct] the safe havens and Britain's 
participation in the [word indistinct] alert force and your 
constant pressure on the Iraqi Government to implement the UN 
resolutions, particularly Resolution 688, not to mention your 
support for democracy worldwide. 
  I would like to ask Your Excellency, in cooperation with the 
member states of the alliance, to try to exclude the Kurdistan 
region from the international economic embargo imposed by the UN 
against Iraq to improve the difficult economic conditions of our 
people. The Iraqi Government has imposed a tight siege on the 
Kurdistan region and is selling us fuel at exorbitant prices in 
hard currency. A few months ago it cut off the electricity 
supply to the Dahuk Governorate. In addition, the abrogation of 
the 25-dinar Iraqi banknote has caused grave economic damage to 
the Kurdistan region. The living conditions are getting worse 
every day. 
  Let me repeat my request for you to show a historic stance 
to 
lift the economic embargo on Kurdistan and to continue sending 
aid to eliminate the fear, repression, and poverty and maintain 
peace and amity. I hope you will be able to visit Kurdistan 
soon. 
  Best regards. 
  Signed, Kusret Rasul Ali, Kurdistan prime minister 
  6 January 1994

  [Text] The Arab labor delegations participating in the 
ninth conference of the International Federation of the Arab 
Workers Trade Unions, being held in Tunis, have denounced the 
allegations and lies uttered by the representative of the regime 
imposed on Kuwait regarding the so-called Kuwaiti prisoners. 
  Replying to the representative of the al-Sabah regime, Fadil 
Mahmud Gharib, head of the General Federation of the Iraqi 
Workers Trade Unions, cited documents and exposed the falsehood 
of these allegations. Gharib explained that these lies are 
aimed at perpetuating the embargo being imposed on the Iraqi 
people. 
  The Iraqi news agency correspondent in Tunis cited Gharib as 
saying that the Iraqi people--who are prominent in Arab history, 
thanks to their pan-Arab heroic deeds, and who have never failed 
to support the fraternal Arab states and carry out a pan-Arab 
role in confronting the hostile plans--will remain steadfast in 
the face of all attempts aimed at destroying Iraq's capabilities 
and preventing Iraq from carrying out its pan-Arab role. 
  Gharib's reply to the representative of the al-Sabah regime 
received lots of applause and profound enthusiasm on the part of 
all Arab labor delegations participating in the conference.

  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  Your Excellency President Saddam Husayn: Greetings. I have 
received with great appreciation your brotherly, sincere 
congratulation on the 29th anniversary of the launching of the 
Palestinian revolution. I am pleased in the name of our 
Palestinian people and my brothers, in the name of the members 
of the PLO Executive Committee, and in my own name to thank you, 
your esteemed government, and the fraternal Iraqi people very 
much and to wish you all the best. 
  I will also seize this opportunity to express to your 
excellency, dear brother, our mujahid Palestinian people's 
feelings of solidarity with and gratitude to the fraternal Iraqi 
people under current circumstances and the unjust blockade that 
is imposed on them and that is targeting the food and medicine 
of their children. 
  We also express our deep belief that fraternal Iraq will be 
able, thanks to its great efforts and capabilities under your 
brave leadership, to overcome this ordeal, difficulties, and 
conspiracies surrounding it and to restore its prominent role in 
our glorious Arab nation's march toward freedom, development, 
and prosperity, which our people lack at this decisive and 
crucial stage of their history as a result of the great 
difficulties they are facing in their fateful negotiating battle 
to regain their freedom and independence and to start building 
their national and economic institutions as a basis for their 
independent state with holy Jerusalem as its capital. 
  I beseech Almighty God to guide our steps in our efforts to 
unify the ranks of our nation, restore its unified position, and 
overcome its wounds in the interest of its generations and it 
dignity. I thank you again and wish your excellency good 
health, happiness, and success, and I hope that the fraternal 
Iraqi people will overcome the ordeals surrounding them and 
resume their march toward progress, development, and prosperity 
under your wise leadership. We will march together to 
Jerusalem, with Almighty God's help. 
  [Signed] Yasir 'Arafat, president of the state of Palestine 
and chairman of the PLO Executive Committee

  The council discussed other topics on its agenda, and 
approved an increase in the capital of the Industrial Bank from 
75 million dinars to 150 million to encourage investment by the 
private industrial sector and in response to the requests 
presented to the bank. 
  The council also discussed organizational matters, and 
adopted the required decisions and recommendations.

<F P=106> ["Viewpoint" column by Barzan al-Tikriti, half brother of </F>
President Saddam Husayn and Iraq's representative to the United 
Nations in Geneva: "The Burdens of Conflict, Regionalism, and 
Prospects for 1994"] 
  [Text] Today, I will not discuss specific developments, 
because such [future] developments can only be known to God. I 
will, instead, refer to certain events that may, in one way or 
another, influence the course of events. I will discuss two 
basic tracks. If these two tracks meet, they can influence 
events in a certain way, and if they clash, they will produce an 
opposite result. 
  The first track involves getting tired of the conflict or 
suffering, regardless of the form of that suffering. The second 
is the growing drift toward regionalism as a result of what 
happened in the Arab region, specifically in the Arabian 
Peninsula and the Gulf. 
  Planes sometimes crash. Despite all the thorough 
investigations they conduct, specialists fail to arrive at an 
obvious or direct result for the crash. Specialists and experts 
may say the crash is caused by "the fatigue of material," which 
sustained constant stresses for years and then, at a certain 
point in time, yielded to these stresses and failed. 
  Similarly, it seems to me that the world is now passing 
through what we may call "yielding to fatigue caused by conflict 
or other elements caused by conflict itself." Those who wish to 
refute this remark cannot use any ongoing conflicts anywhere as 
examples. Even in the midst of these conflicts, the eye can see 
obvious signs of fatigue. This fatigue was probably the real 
reason behind the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, which is not 
allowed to fail. That fatigue may also be the reason behind the 
possibility of reaching peace in the Irish question, as well as 
other chronic, or so-called traditional, questions. 
  If this statement or argument is considered valid, then we 
can assume that several conflicts will come to an end in 1994. 
Based on this, one can say that the civil war in Afghanistan 
will end when a firm and final solution is reached; that peace 
treaties will be signed by the Arab states directly involved in 
the Arab-Israeli conflict; that the war in (former) Yugoslavia 
will end with its partition into several ethnic, independent 
states; and that the Somalis will emerge from the quagmire into 
which they were pushed by the policies and conduct of Siad Birri 
and the Somali factions that are trying to inherit him, not 
because they love to serve Somalia and its people, but because 
they lust for power and hegemony. One can further say that 
matters between the two Yemens will not exacerbate and reach the 
point of a civil war or a semi-regular war for reasons every 
observer knows. 
  All these issues can be resolved if the decisive factor in 
such conflicts and disputes does not interfere. That decisive 
factor is regionalism, which, we can observe, is currently 
growing as a result or what happened in the region. 
  It is noteworthy that the world undergoes cycles of events 
similar to those of economy. We also note that some of these 
cycles witness a trend toward localization with all its 
characteristics and qualities. There is no room here to explain 
this phenomenon which we had earlier discussed in some detail in 
writings, some of which were published. 
  It seems that the world is currently passing through a cycle 
of acute regionalism. It is easy for those interested in or 
following up this trend to note that this cycle clearly exists 
in the Arab world more than anywhere else, particularly in the 
Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf, including Iraq, in spite of the 
fact that this region is historically known for its pan-Arab 
feelings and orientations. We, however, reiterate that the 
feeling of regionalism was the result of what happened in this 
region--a region which endured more than its capacity. Some 
felt that they gave a great deal, but none reciprocated by 
giving them as much as they offered, not even a word of thanks 
and appreciation. What is more ironic is that they were 
destroyed by those for whose sake they gave and sacrificed. 
  Thus far, I cannot say there is any indication that this 
trend is subsiding. What exists is the opposite. Therefore, I 
can say that the new year will witness victories by the 
supporters of regionalism everywhere. Hence, I do not believe 
the Arab world will witness any serious attempt at unification 
neither in a general manner nor on the level of the regional 
entities. In the meantime, there are growing fears about the 
possibility of maintaining Iraq's unity. My reply to these 
fears is that Iraq will remain unified for several reasons. One 
of them is that what applies to Iraq also applies to the 
regional states for reasons known to all, unless these states 
accept what others decide for them or are unaware of what is 
taking place around them or inside their states. 
  There are certain facts which should be recognized by all 
states of diversified demographic structure. They should take 
the national, ethnic, religious, and other diversification into 
consideration. I clearly say that from the demographic 
perspective, Iraq, for example, should not live or behave as if 
it were a 100 percent Arab country nor should Turkey act as if 
it were 100 percent Turkish or Iran as 100 percent Persian. 
What applies to these states also applies to a certain extent 
to Syria and others. The regional conflicts afflicting Somalia, 
Yugoslavia, and Afghanistan will not easily end. These states 
will reach a degree of exhaustion which will make them accept a 
solution even for a period of time. 
  As for the Arab region, it will most likely witness changes 
in the Arabian Peninsula, the Gulf states, and Egypt. The 
extremist, fundamentalist current will get more severe, violent, 
and widespread. The situation in Algeria will get more 
complicated, and things could get out of hand in this fraternal, 
struggling country. Also, the Libyan-Western crisis will get 
worse. The result will be in favor of the West if no changes 
and major positive developments take place in the Arab world. 
These developments are unlikely to happen. This means that 
Libya will regrettably stay on its own. 
  We are confronted then with a general feeling of fatigue as 
a 
result of protracted, bloody conflicts. This trend could lead 
to the achievement of peace in many parts of the world, 
including our region. This, however, depends on the courage of 
the decisionmakers to let bygones be bygones and turn over a new 
leaf by having a serious, realistic view of how things are 
going, despite all the bitterness involved. The purpose of this 
is to arrive at a new, sound framework that clarifies relations 
and precisely spells out rights and duties. Otherwise, things 
will take a different course, similar to what happened when we 
had blood and destruction, especially since these events were 
the outcome of what very brothers did even before more distant 
relatives came into the picture. We should also not forget that 
we have another trend that seeks to fragment the existing states 
and turn them into smaller entities. Should such a trend 
succeed, God forbid, it will spark new conflicts, especially if 
force were used, and this is not unlikely. It is common 
knowledge that force breeds violence, which is almost always a 
means to settle disputes, particularly in the Third World. Here, 
we lay special emphasis on the role of leaders and how much they 
absorb changes. If the concerned leaders realize that regional 
conflicts deserve much of their time and attention -- and as 
such should be debated instead of having recourse to bullets -- 
then it will be possible for the two trends to live together in 
peace. If, however, force has the final say, then the regional 
trend will most likely defeat fatigue and thus reinvigorate 
exhausted conflicts and disputes. 
  I sincerely hope that decisionmakers everywhere, especially 
in our region, will heed this fact. 
  Geneva, 31 December 1993.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ayatollah 'Ali Akbar Khamene'i, leader of the </F>
Islamic revolution, at ceremony in Tehran marking the 
anniversary of the Prophet's divine appointment -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. I also congratulate all the Islamic Umma across the 
world, the honorable nation of Iran, you the honorable audience, 
and the hard working and active officials of the country on this 
day. [passage omitted] 
  Our concern today is like a message, like a mission. We are 
presenting a new message to the world. That is the issue. The 
message will, of course, affect our own lives and our own 
country first, but it also represents a new way for the world. 
The officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran must not forget 
this. 
  This is a system that has come into existence to reveal the 
divine mission to humanity; it has not come into existence to 
learn things from misguided societies, governments, and systems. 
It may be the case that we are very bad, that we may have many 
shortcomings, that we may be very weak for carrying this 
message. Nevertheless, that is the message. It is a message of 
the salvation of humanity. You cannot argue or haggle over this 
message. We have no right to diminish the message in any way 
because something in it may not be quite to our taste. No! 
  This is a message for humanity and humanity needs it. We are 
the friends of humanity. We are not its enemies. We are the 
friends of science, progress, improvement, and comfort for all 
the nations of the world. We know why they are suffering. They 
need spirituality. That spirituality is here. 
  Of course, spirituality cannot be imposed. If it is imposed, 
it loses its effect. We are offering it. There are two points 
we have to bear in mind here. One is for you and I -- that is, 
every single person who carries a responsibility in this system. 
We must pay heed to it. It is this: We are not just managers 
and rulers; we must see ourselves as presenters of a new idea in 
today's world. We must act on that basis. We must follow this 
policy. We must conform to Islam in keeping with this fact. 
That is one point. We must maintain the purity and 
independence of this idea and way of thinking. 
  Another point has to do with the people of the world. Radios 
do their utmost to present the Islamic Republic of Iran as an 
aggressor, always interfering, trying to rout all the regimes of 
the world. No, gentlemen! It is not like that. Anyone can 
live anyway they like, anywhere in the world. We are simply 
offering what humanity needs today. The Lord of the Faithful 
said: The wandering doctor makes his medicines to meet the most 
divine exactions. [preceeding sentence spoken in Arabic] We 
carry in our rucksacks the cures to all of humanity's ills. 
Whoever does not want anything from our rucksack is free not to 
take it. We are not trying to pick a quarrel with anyone. 
[passage omitted] 
  There is propaganda against us, saying: Iran has problems 
with every country, it has difficulties to sort out with every 
one. No! This is not true! Iran has problems only with the 
security organizations of the world's arrogant states, that is, 
the most sinister organizations of those states. The same 
organizations prepare radio propaganda programs against us. Who 
do you think is behind the propaganda of the foreign radio 
stations? They sit and prepare a plan. The Islamic Iran has 
problems with these organizations only and with no one else. We 
do not have any problems with governments and nations, except a 
few of them. We have no reason for having problems. 
  We are a country and a nation with a message. We are a 
population with some strength. We have a past and achievements 
to be proud of, proud of the past and present achievements. 
Such a personality as the Imam [Khomeyni] was among us. As far 
as we know, the world has never seen such a personality, either 
in the contemporary world or in the recent past. We have great 
youths, who demonstrated their capabilities. We have proud 
fathers, mothers, families, and scientists. We do not need 
anything. We do not need anybody. Of course we are not afraid 
of anyone either. No one whatsoever. 
  Why should we provoke such and such country to conquer such 
and such a place, to demolish such and such a building, to 
create a disturbance in such and such an area, or to blow up 
such and such a place? Such actions are undertaken by the 
antihuman apparatus of states which face certain problems. Such 
actions do not come from us. Our message is the message of 
Islam. 
  One of the factors which helps the spread of Islam is 
kindness. Wherever kindness is applied, it decorates actions. 
Kindness means being flexible and not soft. It does not mean 
being soft like a pile of permeable earth. It means not being 
inflexible, intransigent, and abrasive. [passage omitted] We 
are endowed with this virtue and so is Islam and the Koran. 
This should be the lesson of the Koran and the Prophet's 
mission to us. 
  O my dear brothers and sisters present at this gathering and 
all over the country, the lesson of the Koran is that we are the 
messengers of a new word and we must maintain the respect of 
this new word. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani at a </F>
ceremony in Tehran marking the anniversary of the Prophet's 
divine appointment -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] May this auspicious and glorified day be a 
blessing for our Hezbollah community. On behalf of those 
present, I congratulate the honorable and esteemed leader of 
revolution. This is a great day for all Muslims and for our 
nation. [passage omitted] 
  It is obvious that Islamic Iran is at the head of a movement 
today. The first word was spoken by our late imam, and today 
your excellency is repeating the message, guiding and 
supervising our people and humanity. We know that as much as 
this path and way is important for us, it is heavy and bitter 
for the enemies of Islam. Unable to wage physical war they are 
frantically waging a psychological war against the Islamic 
revolution. They miss no opportunity and no occasion to somehow 
weaken this revolution, the Koran, and the prophet's mission in 
the world. But, thank God, they usually fail and they are now 
losing the last game. 
  In Your Excellency's frank and very clear address to the 
people of Qom yesterday, you determined a suitable path, a fresh 
move in the new battle scene, by warning pencil-pushers, 
talkers, and the practical and active forces. Prior to this... 
[pauses] In the second development plan we have policies which 
you sketched out and which officially entered the plan for the 
first time in the history of the revolution. Although in the 
first plan too we enjoyed the imam's frank messages and views, 
this time we, the government, had an organized and codified 
guideline on which to plan policies. Today it is up to the 
Majles to carefully review the policies which are the rights of 
the leader, according to the constitution and to religious law. 
And so we could have policies with peace of mind in the next 
few years. 
  I think with the very frank language which you used 
yesterday, our tribunes, pens, and tongues will not allow our 
enemies in this psychological war to weaken the spirit of our 
ummah, the Koran, and Islam, or to achieve something by 
motivating and inspiring the dejected enemies of Islam. Our 
nation has been and shall continue to be vigilant and to guard 
the messages and orders of the guardianship of the juriconsult.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Rafsanjani Seeks Khamene'i's </F>
Approval for Major Public Sector Purge Operation"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iranian 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani is trying to get the approval of 
Supreme Leader 'Ali Khamene'i for "a major purge operation" to 
put an end to corruption in the public sector institutions. 
Sources close to Rafsanjani yesterday revealed that the 
president was "deeply resentful" of the repeated discovery of 
corruption cases in all government ministries and establishments. 
  A total of 106 cases of corruption were uncovered in the 
past 
six months including sums exceeding $1.5 billion in 13 
government departments, nine state banks, two government-owned 
insurance companies, and seven universities and research 
centers. The corruption cases even reached the establishments 
created by the mullas supposedly for charity. Two such 
establishments have been accused of involvement in the black 
market, smuggling, and extortion of funds from independent 
businessmen. 
  The discovery of these cases has resulted in the arrest of 
80 
people including 22 senior banking officials. In the case of 
one bank, almost all its senior officials have been jailed. 
  In a speech at Tehran University yesterday, Rafsanjani 
admitted that his government is facing "serious difficulties" 
because of the drop in oil revenues. He said his government 
intends to cut expenditures considerably and launch a campaign 
against extravagance and corruption. 
  According to a source close to Rafsanjani, the Iranian 
president will not be able to carry out the required "purge" 
operation because of the restrictions on his powers under the 
Constitution. 
  Khamene'i, whose powers are unlimited under the 
Constitution, 
is the only person who can authorize Rafsanjani to launch such a 
campaign which could "touch some important figures including 
prominent mullas."

  [Text] Tehran, Jan 10 (AFP)--A high-level Iranian 
delegation left here Monday [10 January] for Germany amid shaky 
relations between the two countries, diplomats in Tehran said. 
  The delegation, headed by National Security Council 
secretary 
Mohammad Javad Larijani, is to discuss ways to boost cooperation 
with Germany, Iran's main economic partner. 
  Larijani, who is also deputy-head of the parliament's 
foreign 
affairs subcommittee, said earlier that the delegation would 
seek to "improve understanding and friendship" between the two 
countries. 
  Last October, an Iranian and four Lebanese went on trial in 
Berlin for the murder of four Kurdish opposition leaders, 
allegedly ordered by the Tehran authorities. 
  The German federal prosecutor's office has openly accused 
the 
Iranian secret service of masterminding the killings. Iran has 
denied all involvement. 
  Meanwhile, Iran's supreme court has upheld a death sentence 
against a German technician, Helmut Szimkus, jailed four years 
ago on charges of spying for Iraq. 
  Germany has asked Iran to spare the life of Zsimkus, 59. 
  On Thursday the Iranian judiciary suggested that the German 
could be pardoned by Iran's spiritual guide Ayatollah 'Ali 
Khamene'i, who issued a decree on Sunday granting either an 
amnesty to 2,389 prisoners or a reduction in their sentences. 
  The German embassy in Tehran contacted by AFP was unable to 
say whether Szimkus was among those amnestied.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 11, IRNA -- The English daily `TEHRAN 
TIMES' in its editorial here Tuesday [11 January] called for 
cordial relations between Tehran and Riyadh to abort efforts by 
small groups in both countries to create tension and crisis 
between them. However, the daily noted that these groups are 
not in decisive positions either in Tehran or Riyadh which have 
always played key roles in OPEC since the creation of this 
highly significant world economic organization. 
  "In the final analysis what counts is the decisions reached 
at the level of the leaders of the two countries regarding the 
creation of cordial relationships," the daily added. 
  The daily added that on the final days of 1993 oil prices 
sank to the lowest level in the past five years and the average 
price for OPEC oil basket stood at about dollars 12.67 making 
serious difficulties for most of the petroleum exporting 
countries. 
  In fact OPEC is the only international organization which 
sets price on a single raw material that is produced mainly by a 
number of the third world countries, the daily said. It added 
that the industrially developed countries which had been 
accustomed for too long to the arrogant assumption that it was 
their natural right to determine prices both for the raw 
material they imported from the third world as well as the 
industrial commodities they exported to those countries, are 
trying to weaken OPEC And undermine its very foundations. 
  The countries in the region, Iran and Saudi Arabia in 
particular, realized the problems of the region, said the paper, 
adding that its security needs will have to be settled and 
resolved through peaceful cooperation among themselves. Once 
the regional countries have learned to settle the basic issues 
of the regional security through peaceful strategies, more 
expanded cooperation such as preserving their natural right to 
set the price of oil will automatically follow, it concluded.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mehdi Mirvahedi: "Political Line!"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Any logical person can tell 
with a mere glance at HAMSHAHRI that despite its allegations, 
its administrators have adopted an insincere policy and possibly 
think that the people are naive. After all, who does not know 
that HAMSHAHRI has come so that His Excellency the Mayor will 
stay? 
  In its commentary [on the first anniversary of the 
newspaper], HAMSHAHRI wrote: "We have sincerely tried, contrary 
to some existing newspapers, not to be the mouthpiece or 
spokesman for one specific line of political thought, to refrain 
from making our newspaper an instrument for "settling accounts" 
or "throwing rivals off the scene," and not to become involved 
in shallow press disputes." 
  There is no doubt of the fact that HAMSHAHRI can be listed 
among those who are "indifferent" to the world of politics. 
However, undoubtedly we cannot agree that HAMSHAHRI is nobody's 
mouthpiece. It is very clear that analyzing important and basic 
domestic and foreign issues is not an easy task, and having 
political thought is a newspaper's strength and not a weakness, 
as our dear colleagues at HAMSHAHRI believe. But the fact that 
they have not chosen to enter this field is probably because 
they are unable to and not because they do not want to. 
[passage omitted] 
  Finally, despite the remarks by HAMSHAHRI's proprietor that 
"our initiatives and innovations and our use of new techniques 
is good for competition" we should say that this competition 
with the other newspapers is not being carried out in a healthy 
atmosphere. HAMSHAHRI has acquired the new techniques by making 
use of the municipality's general budget, which is the money 
that the municipality gets from the people. And selling a 
newspaper at one-tenth of the price of other newspapers is press 
dumping [preceding word in English] and not healthy competition!

  [Text] President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and Prime 
Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto have appealed to the Afghan 
president, Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani; the prime minister, 
Engineer Golboddin Hekmatyar; and all other political parties in 
Afghanistan to cease hostilities and observe a permanent 
cease-fire effective from 0600 on Friday [14 January] morning. 
The appeal has been made by the Pakistani leaders being 
encouraged by positive response to Pakistan's earlier request 
for a temporary cease-fire and keeping in view the brotherly 
ties existing between Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is also 
based on a (?view) to restoring peace and stability in 
Afghanistan. All Afghan parties have further been urged not to 
resume hostilities until the Islamic Conference Organization and 
friendly countries have had a full opportunity to effect 
conciliation and to resolve their differences. 
  Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and Ms. Benazir Bhutto have 
noted with alarm the situation in Afghanistan over the last 10 
days and the resort to force by contending parties which have 
resulted in the tragic loss of life and large-scale destruction 
of property. In order to alleviate the sufferings of Afghan 
brothers and sisters affected by the recent hostilities, 
Pakistan has extended immediate humanitarian aid containing 
medicines and fully equipped field hospitals. These will be 
sent to Afghanistan as soon as the cease-fire is agreed. 
Pakistan is already actively participating in relief facilities 
for displaced Afghans who have left Kabul.

  [Text] The UN Security Council president, Kovanda Karel of 
the Czech Republic, has expressed serious concern about the 
human rights violations in the occupied Kashmir. He expressed 
this concern at a meeting at the UN with Attorney Sultan Mahmud, 
president of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Liberation League. 
According to APP, Karel supported an investigation at the 
international level in the human rights situation in the 
occupied Kashmir. Attorney Sultan Mahmud also met with the UN 
undersecretary general, Mr. Marrack Goulding. He demanded that 
the United Nations send a delegation of the human rights 
commission to the occupied Kashmir to investigate the very grave 
situation there. The Kashmiri leader also met with many other 
members of the Security Council and presented a memorandum to 
them explaining the current situation in the occupied Kashmir.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Talk of Nuclear War?"] </F>
  [Text] The words attributed to Foreign Minister Sardar 
Assef Ahmad Ali that nuclear war could engulf the whole of South 
Asia if the Kashmir dispute was not resolved, are hard to 
believe. To contemplate such an eventuality, howsoever remote 
it may be, cannot be accepted. Firstly, because Pakistan has so 
far been insisting that its nuclear programme is of a peaceful 
nature. And secondly, because such a statement coming from 
Pakistan's Foreign Minister will only give an excuse to India 
not to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. India would 
project his statement abroad as a threat and start stockpiling 
nuclear arms openly. The reason why Sardar Assef made that 
statement, if at all, is not hard to find. His perception, as 
also the perception of most Pakistanis, is that India is not 
serious in solving the Kashmir problem. It wants to intensify 
its brutal suppression of the freedom movement till all those 
involved in it are killed or otherwise eliminated. By holding 
talks with Pakistan, it only wishes to impress those foreign 
powers which have been pressuring it to find a negotiated 
settlement with Pakistan. It also wants to buy time. An 
indication of that is the recent statement of the Indian Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao, in which he said that India would soon 
solve the Kashmir problem in its favour. Provocative as this 
and other statements of the Indian leaders may be (such as that 
of the Defence Minister Dinesh Singh, who said that the 
Kashmiris have only one choice, that of joining India), our 
reaction ought to be of restraint. 
  After all, not all the peaceful means of tackling this 
problem have yet been exhausted. Pakistan's efforts to rouse 
international opinion against Indian obduracy have yet to begin. 
The effort to mobilise public sentiment abroad against the 
violation of human rights in Held Kashmir, which had to be 
abandoned earlier, has yet to be revived. Fortunately, the 
attitude of the UN Secretariat, which used to be of indifference 
only a few months back, has changed. Its rebuttal of the Indian 
Foreign Secretary's claim about the `irrelevance' of the UN 
Resolutions has been quite firm and clear. We have to wait and 
see if the world will stand by and condone the genocide of the 
Kashmiris? We will also have to see if we, being driven to the 
wall, are left with no way out. Only then we should think of 
other solutions than of peace.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Proconsular Visit"] </F>
  [Text] General Joseph P. Hoar, commander of [as published] 
chief of the US central command, has by now become a frequent 
visitor in Pakistan who is treated with somewhat greater 
deference than what is shown for generals from elsewhere. He is 
here again on what may be his umpteenth visit, going through an 
almost unchanging itinerary. This includes not only a junket 
throughout the country inspecting the military installations but 
calling on the state functionaries including the President. 
  The frequency of his visits suggest this is no mere courtesy 
call but a routine function of his responsibilities as the 
C-in-C [Commander in Chief] of a command which covers the region 
Pakistan is in. No government has ever given any explanation 
for the regularity of the General's visits and it is needless to 
expect the present regime to do so. Military matters of this 
nature are still obscured by a sort of an information denial 
system and little is ever known of such issues till much later 
when comment becomes redundant. 
  However, in the present circumstances, there is need to 
quantify the American General's visit as it comes at a time when 
there has been no change in Washington's policy towards 
Islamabad. Although Pakistan just escaped by a hair's breadth 
from being put on the black list of the states accused of aiding 
terrorism, it is still in a grey area, a kind of a limbo, as far 
as relations with America are concerned. None of the stringent 
curbs imposed as a result of the Pressler amendment have been 
lifted, nor has the State Department relented from raising the 
bogey of nuclear weapons, supposedly stashed away in Pakistan. 
To all intents and purposes, this country remains out in the 
cold waiting with consummate patience to be returned to the good 
graces of the United States. 
  Against this background, General Hoar's visit arouses even 
greater curiosity that needs to be cleared away. As Pakistan is 
no longer the recipient of any kind of American military aid nor 
any of the security pacts are operative that once linked the two 
states, it is intriguing why should the General be here so often 
and under what sort of understanding the joint US-Pak military 
exercises are being held. These two queries must also be seen 
in the light of Islamabad's increasing concern over the apparent 
American leniency towards India on the nuclear issue and its 
hardline policy towards Pakistan. It makes no sense that 
Islamabad should remain involved in a bizarre love hate linkage 
with Washington, which neither holds any gilt-edged guarantee of 
better times ahead nor allows taking up other options. 
  This policy has been pursued by all the governments after 
the 
bonanza of American munificence resulting from the "Afghan 
jehad" gradually dried up. Even the Nawaz Sharif regime, which 
made a fetish of its self-proclaimed "independent" policy and 
doing away with the "crutches" of aid, never really got out of 
this Catch-22 situation. General Hoar was then just as much a 
regular visitor as now. In fact no government has ever thought 
of charting out a brave new policy or will do so, specially in 
the present unipolar world. It is quite likely the vague policy 
of waiting for America to issue us a certificate of fitness, 
after Islamabad has done its best to clear away the doubts, will 
continue.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Stop Feuding, Start Governing the Country"] </F>
  [Text] No apology needed to revert to the state of the 
Pakistan People's Party [PPP]. It is not at its best. Of 
course, it could be worse. That all is not well is becoming 
more and more pronouncedly clear. The Al Murtaza firing death 
of a student supporter of Mir Murtaza Bhutto; the dramatic 
arrest, release and arrest of PPP activist Suresh Kumar; the 
weird allegations of harbouring RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] 
agents against Begum Nusrat Bhutto; the hasty suspension of a 
whole platoon of police officers and men in Larkana; Premier 
Benazir Bhutto's prolonged stay in Larkana; her renewed emphasis 
on a rapprochement with the much maligned MQM [Muhajir Qaumi 
Movement]; the swearing in of a bloated cabinet in Punjab; 
intermittent sparring between Punjab Chief Minister Wattoo and 
Senior Minister Hayat; the unexplained delay in finalising the 
government at the centre... One could go on and on with 
embarrassing items of omission and commission. In a word there 
is widespread scepticism about how confident a grip the Benazir 
Bhutto government has over the issues that need effective 
handling. What is undermining the PPP administration's image in 
public eye is the family feud which shows no sign of abating. 
The elder lady has not distinguished herself for either 
patience or propriety; the younger remains manifestly unsure. 
There is no doubt that she is trying her best to play it cool. 
So far, her best has not been good enough. The temperature is 
constantly rising. The Al Murtaza incident was exactly what the 
Prime Minister should have done without. No one except the PPP 
government in Sindh is to blame for it. There may or may not be 
a convincing case for the heavy hand falling on the Larkana 
police, but there is a compelling case against the Government of 
Sindh. From the very start, it went about its precautions to 
prevent untoward incidents in a very unwise manner. It virtually 
invited trouble and got it in unendurable abundance. This 
gigantic error of the Sindh Government has already cost the PPP 
leader so much of undeserved agony. And no end to it is in 
sight. 
  The damage done is profound and painful. Part of it may now 
be beyond repair. What Ms. Benazir is apparently trying is 
damage-limitation. How much she may be able to salvage is still 
not very clear. The professional Cassandras may be exaggerating 
the losses incurred by the PPP, or the cracks in party unity. 
However, there is little doubt that a hairline fracture is 
there. It is a challenge to the PPP leadership to heal it. 
Patience, forbearance and even forgiveness may be the right 
recipe. Begum Nusrat Bhutto has undoubtedly been unduly rasping 
with her tongue. Perhaps she cannot help it at this moment in 
her life. But the real damage caused to the PPP is by its own 
jialas [workers] hurling thoughtless and undignified accusations 
questioning the integrity and patriotism of Begum Nusrat Bhutto. 
It is difficult to imagine of anything more condemnable. It is 
not the politics of civilised people. Political differences are 
understandable, debasing of politics is not. Let us not pollute 
the already muddied waters. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto would be less than wise if she 
failed to realise that there is need to lift politics out of the 
abyss into which it has fallen as a result of what should have 
been no more than a passing family misunderstanding sorted out 
pleasantly -- and in private. There is still time and room to 
set things right. Start by clearing the question of 
"succession". The Pakistan People's Party is not Bhutto family 
property. It is the legacy which the people of Pakistan -- no 
individual, however high or mighty -- is entitled to inherit. 
This humbug about Mir Murtaza Bhutto or the Bhutto widow, is 
the sole proprietor of the PPP, must be buried under a million 
tons of earth, never to be resurrected. The election of Ms. 
Benazir Bhutto as Party Chairperson should be regularised 
according to PPP constitution. And that should be that. The 
Prime Minister should accord the highest priority to a 
settlement with MQM, without which it would be almost impossible 
to normalise Sindh. And it is about time the Prime Minister 
started governing the country in right earnest.

cafeteria, Syed Iqbal Haider said the government's efforts to 
create an atmosphere of understanding with the opposition did 
not produce any result. The law minister said Prime Minister 
Ms. Benazir Bhutto invited the leader of the opposition in the 
National Assembly, Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif, for talks on 
several occasions to evolve consensus on common points contained 
in their respective manifestos on vital national issues, 
including matters relating to national security, so that harm is 
not caused to national interests. But Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Sharif 
refused. The president, he added, also invited PML-N [Pakistan 
Muslim League-Nawaz faction] leader in Islamabad and then in 
Lahore for creating understanding in the political field, but 
Mr. Nawaz Sharif again refused. The law minister renewed the 
government's offer of a dialogue on major national issues to Mr. 
Mohammad Nawaz Sharif.

  [Text] Karachi, Jan 8 -- Suresh Kumar, an active worker of 
the Murtaza Bhutto Committee, who had escaped from the custody 
of Larkana Police Thursday, was arrested by the army Saturday 
morning. 
  Official sources claimed that he was trying to cross over to 
the neighbouring country. He was arrested near Khairpur by the 
military intelligence, the sources added. 
  They alleged that Suresh, who was injured in police firing 
on 
the Z A Bhutto's birth anniversary, Jan 5, was a trained 
terrorist. He had escaped from the Chandka Medical college of 
Larkana after being in police custody for nearly 24 hours. 
  The Sindh Government had suspended a senior superintendent 
of 
police and 58 others for being negligent of their 
responsibility, and had also arrested certain police personnel 
for security leak. 
  Begum Nusrat Bhutto had already denied that Suresh was a RAW 
[Research and Analysis Wing] agent saying that he had worked for 
the Sindh Information Minister, Perves Ali Shah, in Khairpur 
during the elections. 
  The sources disclosed that Suresh had been taken to an 
unknown place for interrogation by the intelligence hounds. 
However, it was not told that whether charges would be framed 
against him in court. 
  It may be added that Pervez Ali Shah had said that Suresh is 
a known "terrorist" and has been involved in over 60 cases. He 
had told newsmen here that some 200 RAW agents were still inside 
Al-Murtaza in Larkana.

<F P=106> [Sulayman Salim report: "First Agreement Between Garang and </F>
Mashar on Plan To Confront Government"] 
  [Excerpts] Nairobi -- The leaders of the two wings of the 
Sudanese People's Liberation Movement [SPLM], Colonel John 
Garang and Dr. Riak Mashar, who broke away from him, have agreed 
for the first time to present a joint plan in peace negotiations 
expected to be held with the Sudanese Government. 
  The plan includes the right to self-determination for 
southern Sudan and a referendum in this connection after the 
announcement of a cease-fire among the Sudanese parties to the 
conflict. An official Sudanese source told AL-HAYAH in Nairobi 
yesterday that the Sudanese Government delegation to the 
negotiations is authorized to discuss any issue the SPLM may 
raise, except the self-determination issue -- which means that 
no progress is likely to occur in the negotiations if they 
actually take place between the two sides. [passage omitted] 
  AL-HAYAH yesterday obtained a copy of the Garang-Mashar plan 
for the negotiations, which is entitled "Agenda for the Peace 
Talks in Sudan." 
  The plan says: "We met on 5 and 6 January in separate 
meetings in Nairobi with the ministerial committee regarding the 
peace talks in Sudan. And we agreed on a joint agenda" for 
negotiation with the Sudanese Government. 
  The plan includes three points: 
  1. To negotiate a cease-fire among all parties to the 
conflict in order to halt all military actions under the 
supervision of a neutral team of international observers and to 
secure favorable conditions to facilitate humanitarian relief 
operations in southern Sudan. 
  2. The right to self-determination for the people of 
southern Sudan, the al-Nubah mountains, and other marginalized 
areas. This can be done through a referendum in these areas to 
enable the people there to determine their political future by 
themselves. 
  3. To make a temporary arrangement to implement these 
measures during the transitional phase that follows the halt to 
military actions, until a permanent arrangement is made. 
  The plan was signed by John Garang and Riak Mashar. It is 
the first joint plan between the two men to be presented in the 
peace negotiations with the government since the split inside 
the movement in 1991. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lieutenant General Brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, met with the brother 
officials in Ta'izz Governorate, and the representatives of 
political parties and groups, trade unions, businessmen, tribal 
chiefs, notables, youths, the armed forces, and the public 
security forces. 
  During the meeting, Brother 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih greeted 
those attending and through them all the sons of the 
governorate. He referred to the daily concerns of the sons of 
our Yemeni people and their tribulations as a result of the 
crisis our country is experiencing at this stage of its history. 
He said that he has taken note of what many sons of the 
governorate have spoken about, and who have aired their concerns 
during this meeting. 
  He said: I would like to thank my brothers, the sons of this 
governorate who have contributed to the success of the large 
popular gathering in the governorate through which they have 
emphasized their concern for the unity of the homeland and the 
cohesion of its sons, and blessed this gathering, which is a 
positive and effective sign and an example the other 
governorates should emulate to voice their views and air their 
concerns on the crisis the homeland and unity are experiencing 
in these circumstances. 
  The brother president spoke about the causes of the current 
political crisis in the country. He said: We know very well 
who has fabricated this crisis that has greatly harmed our 
national economy and has created a rift in national unity. The 
brother president reviewed the efforts that were exerted to 
reunite the homeland, a strategic objective of the Yemeni 
revolution and the most cherished achievement recorded by the 
Yemeni people since 1981. He also noted the meetings and 
dialogue that followed until 22 May 1990, when these efforts 
were crowned with the declaration of the establishment of unity 
and the establishment of the Republic of Yemen by peaceful and 
brotherly means through which the one Yemeni family, which had 
been dispersed by colonialism and the imamate, was reunited. 
The brother president said: The Yemenis offered the most 
cherished sacrifices to regain this unity. The brother 
president thanked the sons of the Ta'izz Governorate for hosting 
the meeting of the Yemeni ulema, which is being held in the 
mosque of revered Prophet Muhammad's companion Ma'adh ibn-Jabal 
in the al-Janad area in accordance with the call that was 
addressed to me and to the brother vice president to meet in 
this historical mosque and in this heroic city to study the 
present crisis and find solutions that will save the masses of 
our people from the tribulation they suffer as a result of the 
economic crisis brought about by the political crisis and the 
great impact it has left on the daily life of the citizen. 
  The brother president said: In these critical circumstances, 
I call on every citizen to say what he believes to be right and 
to confront what is wrong without fear. He added: We want 
every citizen to say to the person who committed a mistake that 
he has done so and to the benefactor that he has done right. We 
want the citizen to raise his sincere and resonant voice on what 
is taking place now, fearing God only. 
  In his address, the brother president spoke about the causes 
of the crisis and its developments. He said: The crisis has 
been exacerbated since 19 August last year following the return 
of my comrade and colleague 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP] secretary general, from his trip abroad for 
treatment. All the masses of our people are aware of this. We 
have endured many falsehoods, and suffered great harm, and the 
falsification of facts for the sake of the homeland and to 
safeguard unity. Everyone knows that the crisis began within 
the framework of our partner, the YSP, which later transferred 
it into a crisis between the president and his deputy, and then 
between the General People's Congress [GPC] and the YSP, and 
then between the GPC, the YSP and the Yemeni Reform Grouping. 
We must now clarify things and tell all the facts so that all 
the people will know who is responsible for the crisis and how 
it has been exacerbated. He said that the government under 
Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has not come forth with any 
state budget since 1993 and the state is now being run in 1994 
without any budget. He explained that some forces and quarters 
are working to destroy the state's institutions, particularly 
the forces and quarters that stood against unity and seek to 
spread disorder, corruption, and sabotage in our society. 
  The brother president said: We must shun all the 
experiences that were tried during the so-called fragmentation 
era and evaluate our experience in the economic, administrative, 
and development areas by economic, sharia, law, and 
administration scientists and experts so that we may choose the 
best. We are not biased toward any single experience. What we 
want is to build our homeland on sound bases, away from 
oneupmanship and empty slogans. He indicated that there are 
those who seek to exacerbate the citizens' sufferings through 
price hikes to instigate and foment anger and prompt citizens to 
engage in riots, sabotage, and plunder, as happened on 9-10 
December 1992. He noted that he had accepted all the points the 
YSP has raised since the eruption of the crisis, beginning with 
the three points regarding the proposed amendments to the 
drafting of the articles enshrined in the constitutional 
amendment bills pertaining to local government, the Advisory 
Council, and the form of presidency, and ending with the 18 
points, the acceptance of which was set as a condition for the 
attainment of a solution, not to mention its demands for the 
enactment of a presidential elections bill, of which a similar 
bill has already been passed. The parties to the coalition 
government concluded an agreement on the aforementioned 
amendments. We have also accepted the decisions and 
recommendations made by the masses' gatherings in the provinces, 
the last of which were the decisions made by the masses' 
gathering of the Ta'izz Province and the initiative of their 
eminences the ulema. 
  The brother president added: We have accepted all this to 
spare Yemen any possible dangers. I have come to Ta'izz to 
resolve the crisis. In the past, I went several times to Aden 
to achieve unity. Why then doesn't the Ta'izz meeting 
materialize to preserve and safeguard unity, spare our people 
seditions, and relieve them of this immense suffering, which is 
caused by the crisis? 
  The brother president touched on several current issues, 
including the issue of local government. He noted that he is 
for easing the centralization of authority and the introduction 
of administrative decentralization. He added: We have 
instructed the government to achieve this objective. We also 
asked it to draft new legislation stipulating that local 
councils must create their own revenues, which must be used to 
implement development and services projects in the provinces. 
  The brother president called upon the residents of the 
Ta'izz 
Governorate, and all of our people's masses, to demonstrate 
vigilance and awareness so they may be able to confront 
misleading propaganda and the misrepresentation of facts being 
promoted by some in order to thwart the efforts of those who are 
attempting to make our country take steps backward or push it 
into the abyss. 
  The meeting was opened by a recitation of Koranic verses. 
Then, Shaykh Muhammad Muhammad 'Abd-al-Malik delivered a speech 
on behalf of the province's population. He began by welcoming 
the brother president. On behalf of the province's population, 
he thanked the brother president for the favorable response he 
showed to the ulema's call for a meeting between him and his 
brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid at al-Janad Mosque. He hoped that 
this initiative will be well received by all in the interest of 
Yemen and its stability. He added: Our people's masses are 
looking forward to this meeting, which we hope will crown all 
efforts with success, so that our people may cope with their 
problems and meet the challenges facing their unity. For, this 
is a must if they are to achieve progress and prosperity under 
unity, the people's fate. 
  Then, brother 'Ali 'Abdallah al-Dali'i delivered a speech on 
behalf of the coordination council of political organizations 
and parties. He began by welcoming the visit of the brother 
president to the province on this spiritual occasion, which is 
dear to our Yemeni people. He explained the political 
organizations' positions on the political crisis being 
experienced by our country, which is jeopardizing its unity. He 
added: The Yemeni masses, who have made dear sacrifices to 
promote the Yemeni revolution and achieve unity, will not 
hesitate to make additional sacrifices to safeguard unity and 
entrench it. 
  Afterward, an open discussion was held. Several brother 
members of the expanded masses' gathering of the Ta'izz Province 
took part in this discussion. In this discussion, they affirmed 
their concern for safeguarding and defending the unity of the 
homeland, and asked that a serious and responsible dialogue be 
used as a vehicle for defusing the crisis. They also 
underscored the need for the two brothers, the Presidential 
Council chairman and the Presidential Council vice chairman, to 
meet at the Mu'ad Bin-Jabal Mosque in response to the Yemeni 
ulema's appeal to reach solutions that will resolve the crisis 
and halt the sufferings and calamities it is causing to citizens. 
  The meeting was attended by several brother state officials.

Jordanian Officers in Sanaa To Supervise Implementation of 
Dialogue Committee Decisions"] 
  [Text] An atmosphere of caution prevailed in Aden 
yesterday, and shops in the city closed following the refusal of 
'Ali Salim al-Bid, deputy chairman of the Yemeni Presidential 
Council, to go to al-Jand Mosque in Ta'izz to meet with 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  It seems that the Yemeni crisis has entered a new phase of 
complications as a result of the failure to hold the meeting for 
which the ulema called. [passage omitted] 
  Military sources have revealed to AL-HAYAH the presence of 
24 
Jordanian officers in Sanaa at a request from the national 
dialogue committee concerned with the Yemeni crisis to supervise 
its decisions concerning the military aspect, redeployment of 
the Armed Forces, and efforts to end military tension. However, 
these officers have not been able to move into Aden as a result 
of Socialist Party leaders' objection to their presence and to 
entrusting them with certain tasks, despite their earlier 
approval. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim al-Bishari, envoy to the Arab League </F>
and "general coordinator for Egyptian-Libyan relations," by an 
unidentified reporter in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Reporter] Where do relations, 
and both direct and indirect dialogue, stand between you and the 
United States? 
  [Al-Bishari] Some fraternal countries, like Egypt and 
Tunisia, are engaged in persistent efforts in this regard. We 
are pinning great hopes on the constant and important efforts 
being made by President Mubarak to address this issue. We hope 
that these efforts will bear fruit. Hence, our contacts with 
the United States have not been interrupted, thwarted, or 
suspended. All that there is to it is that the issue has become 
complicated after the tightening of the sanctions against us. 
The issue has become part of efforts by big powers to finalize 
some arrangements in the region, given the interests they have 
in it. This has been manifested in what is taking place in 
Palestine, the calls made for the launching of a Middle East 
market, as well as the situation in Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the Gulf, and Iraq. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Now that the key witness in the Lockerbie affair 
has retracted his testimony, what is your position on this 
issue? How can you take advantage of this new development? 
  [Al-Bishari] We are trying to make international and 
regional 
organizations informed about this new development as quickly as 
possible. We will benefit from this development. Likewise, we 
will keep the permanent members of the UN Security Council, 
particularly the PRC, informed of this new development, given 
its weight at the UN General Assembly, as well as its 
convictions regarding Libya's innocence. This new development 
may also influence public opinion, as well as the policies of 
nonpermanent members of the UN Security Council, which were 
pressured to vote against us. 
  [Reporter] Why did Libya receive the Serbian foreign 
minister 
at a time when barbaric massacres against the Bosnian people are 
being escalated? Doesn't this undermine your credibility with 
the Muslim world? 
  [Al-Bishari] Libya is making honest efforts to end the 
calamity of the Bosnian people. We believe that it is necessary 
to hold direct talks with the major party to the crisis, namely 
the Serbs, if we are to influence them and induce them to end 
the massacres against Muslims. This is a serious effort on our 
part. [passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] Libya was reported to have had a hand in the 
disappearance of onetime Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur 
al-Kikhya, and that the Libyan Government had a vested interest 
in his disappearance. Does what happened prejudice your 
relations with the Egyptians? 
  [Al-Bishari] We are as surprised as the next man by his 
disappearance. We do not regard him as an enemy. If anything, 
there has not been any break in his relations with Libyan 
Government officials. We have been and still are bound together 
by an open and friendly relationship. Our lines of 
communications were open. His family remains in Libya and is 
being treated with all respect and appreciation. The man posed 
no threat whatsoever in order for us to move against him and 
thus jeopardize our Egyptian relations and interests in Egypt. 
Al-Kikhya is a man of stature. He once served as minister in 
view of the revolution's confidence in him. He left office 
having reached the age of retirement. I recall one day the 
brother colonel [al-Qadhdhafi] asked that we contact him in 
Paris and ask him to go to Algeria as a member of a Libyan 
delegation when Ahmed Ben-Bella returned to his country. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Reporter] How do you react to reports that Libyan-Egyptian 
relations are strained and that Dr. Usamah al-Baz's mission in 
Libya last month was a failure? 
  [Al-Bishari] There's no truth in these reports. Nor will we 
allow such a thing to happen. Ours is a strategic relationship 
that we will not allow anyone to sabotage. In none of the 
assignments entrusted to Dr. al-Baz by President Mubarak to seek 
a way out of the Lockerbie affair has he failed. Besides, as 
far as al-Kikhya's disappearance is concerned, Libya is not in 
the dock for al-Baz to go to Tripoli to talk about the affair. 
Again, the man is not an enemy of ours. We wish him a safe and 
speedy return to his children and wife. We hope the mystery of 
his disappearance will be solved. We -- Egyptians and Libyans 
alike -- are distressed by his disappearance. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Salwa al-Ustuwani report: "Syrian Official: Al-Asad Is </F>
Taking a Complete Arab Peace Paper to Geneva"] 
  [Excerpt] Damascus -- As mid-January, the date for the 
U.S.-Syrian summit in Geneva, approaches, attention is firmly 
focused on what President Hafiz al-Asad is taking with him to 
Geneva in the form of a peace paper. 
  A high-ranking Syrian official has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
that what President al-Asad proposes at the Geneva summit 
meeting will be the most important factor for the establishment 
of full peace in the region and that U.S. President Bill Clinton 
would not have requested the meeting with President al-Asad had 
he not been strongly convinced that the Syrian demands 
representing all Arab rights are just and that the forthcoming 
peace will not be a fragile peace but a genuine, firm, and 
strong peace that will provide security and prosperity for the 
region. 
  The Syrian official said that President al-Asad will carry 
with him a complete peace document not about liberation of the 
Golan and Syrian-Israeli peace but about liberation of the 
accupied Arab territories and restoration of rights. He added 
that when President al-Asad received U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher and in his contacts with President Clinton, he 
repeated the same position, namely that peace is an indivisible 
integral whole and cannot be achieved in some parts to the 
exclusion of other parts, and that the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
was the best proof exposing Israel's lack of interest in peace 
except on its own terms and in fulfillment of its own objectives. 
  The Syrian official said that Syria's aim is to preserve the 
unified Arab position of the frontline states in the face of 
future challenges because Israel continues to change the 
realities on the ground, showing no interest in progress that 
would lead to a just and lasting peace. The Syrian official 
added that the current Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese coordination is 
important in case the bilateral peace negotiations are resumed. 
  The senior Syrian official said that the Geneva summit is a 
major turning point in U.S.-Syrian relations and that the summit 
and its results will determine whether or not a just peace is 
possible. Perhaps the changes in U.S.-Syrian relations and the 
U.S. emphasis on Syria's central role in the peace process have 
made Israeli very resentful and aroused its concern because 
Rabin cannot walk away from the clear concept of peace to be 
proposed by Syria in Geneva, otherwise he would lose the 
justification for his continuation in power. 
  Syria, the Syrian official said, insists on complete 
withdrawal from the Golan and southern Lebanon, and the 
al-Asad-Clinton summit will witness a Syrian position pressing 
for a revival of Resolution 425 on Israeli withdrawal from 
southern Lebanon. That, he said, confirms the credibility of 
Syria's position on Lebanon and shows that Syria cannot possibly 
barter Lebanese territory, not even a single grain of Lebanese 
soil, in return for the restoration of its own territory 
whatever its size. By taking that stance, Syria will pave the 
way for Lebanese diplomacy in the next phase of peace 
negotiations. 
  Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has expressed full 
satisfaction with the results of his talks and consultations in 
Damascus with President Hafiz al-Asad at a meeting lasting three 
hours. Lebanese sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the 
consultation channels between Damascus and Beirut will remain 
open at the highest levels until the moment President Hafiz 
al-Asad leaves Damascus on his peace trip to Geneva to submit 
the Syrian Arab demands in strong terms. 
  The Lebanese sources quoted Prime Minister al-Hariri as 
saying that President al-Asad reaffirmed Syria's support and 
backing for Lebanon in all fields to enable it to fully regain 
its health and liberate its territory from Israeli occupation, 
emphasizing that Syria will never abandon Lebanon and leave it 
alone in the arena. President al-Asad also expressed support for 
the Lebanese Government and continuation of the current 
political situation with no changes until the processes of 
peace, accord, and reconstruction are completed. He also 
stressed that Syria will never abandon its demand and insistence 
on the implementation of Resolution 425 and Israeli withdrawal.

  [Text] A German Judiciary spokesman has stated that a 
Libyan diplomat being held in Lebanon is believed to be one of 
the main perpetrators of an attack on Americans in Berlin in 
1986. He demanded that the suspect be handed over to the German 
authorities. 
  A German court issued a warrant for the arrest of suspect 
Yusuf S. [not further identified] in 1990 for participating in 
the attack. The spokesman added that the German court also 
accuses him of planning the attack. 
  On 5 April 1986, a bomb blast at a nightclub frequented by 
U.S. military personnel in Berlin killed three people and 
wounded 230 others. The United States accused Libya of being 
behind the attack and retaliated by bombing Tripoli 10 days 
later. 
  Lebanese judiciary sources said the man being detained in 
Lebanon, who is of Palestinian origin, worked in the Jamahiriyah 
office in East Berlin. The spokesman added that the man was 
arrested in Lebanon in 1992 and has been in custody since. The 
spokesman could not say whether he was arrested for the charges 
against him or for other reasons. 
  The spokesman added: "Since then, we have been trying to get 
him handed over to Germany to try him." He added: "The German 
Embassy received his file in August 1993." 
  The German authorities were informed of the arrest of Yusuf 
S. in Lebanon at the end of 1992 but the information was not 
revealed so as to keep the investigation secret. 
  Another Palestinian, 'Imad Mahmud (37), has been held in 
Berlin since November 1992 on charges of planning and 
participating in the attack on the nightclub.

  [Text] Talking to newsmen in Hyderabad yesterday evening, 
Narasimha Rao said a polarization of political parties is taking 
place on the basis of secular and nonsecular policies in the 
country. He said that is a reason why many parties are being 
attracted to the Congress-I. 
  Regarding India-Pakistan ties, the prime minister reiterated 
that India is persuading Pakistan to give up its support to 
terrorists. Pakistan is not responding so far, but we will 
continue with our efforts. 
  Replying to a question, Mr. Rao said that his government is 
committed to build a temple and the mosque at Ayodhya.

  [Text] Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali today met 
with foreign journalists at the Prime Ministry, and took 
questions about latest regional and local developments. 
  The prime minister announced that His Majesty King Husayn is 
to meet with President Bill Clinton after 20 January. Dr. 
al-Majali said the session will help the peace talks and ties 
between Jordan and the United States, particularly in the 
economic area. Movement on the other tracks, especially on the 
Syrian-Israeli track, will reflect positively on the other 
fronts, the prime minister said. 
  Asked about the upcoming meeting between the Syrian and U.S. 
Presidents in Geneva, al-Majali stated that Jordan and all the 
partners to the Middle East peace process are hopeful it will 
yield positive results. In its contacts, he added, Jordan has 
underlined the comprehensiveness of the peace process and that 
any headway made in one of the tracks is bound to extend to 
other tracks. 
  The prime minister was asked how happy Jordan was with the 
agreement reached with the Palestinians on 7 January. We are 
quite happy with it, al-Majli said. The points on which 
agreement was reached, he added, meet realistic expectations and 
directly benefit the Palestinians as they now truly feel that 
they have a partner and support in us. We are brothers bound by 
distinguished ties, and as partners, the talks of the 
Palestinians with the Israelis are bound to rub off on us. As 
for the sense of urgency the Jordanians had shown in regard to 
the agreement with the Palestinians, al-Majali said: I'll turn 
the question around and ask why such an agreement with our 
Palestinian brothers should wait. Right from the beginning of 
the economic talks, the Palestinians were visibly anxious to get 
an economic agreement with us. Two lengthy meetings of the 
joint committee with the Palestinians produced a draft 
agreement, but the Palestinian side, the prime minister noted, 
slowed up and chose to wait. Jordan impressed on them the 
importance of signing it in the interest of a clearly defined 
bilateral relationship and so that they talk with the Israelis 
against the background of a clear picture. Jordan, noted 
al-Majali, has numerous institutions and the kind of 
multi-faceted experience that the brother Palestinians may draw 
on. 
  On inter-Arab ties, the prime minister stressed that Jordan 
is working in good faith to have the best of relations with all 
Arab states, especially with brothers in the Arabian Gulf 
states. Jordan, he pointed out, has met with some success in 
this regard, noting the receptiveness of Qatar and the United 
Arab Emirates, as well as Oman, with which Jordan already had 
close relations. The prime minister wished these relations 
would grow ever stronger and extend to the rest of the brotherly 
Arab states, noting that Egypt is working in that direction.

  [Text] The Saddamite regime's troops continue their 
intensive onslaught against the southern marshes, particularly 
the (al-Huwayjah) marshes, shelling them with large-caliber 
weapons and causing wide-scale damage in the region. 
  The Monday issue of the newspaper AL-MU'TAMAR, citing Iraqi 
opposition sources, adds that approximately 1,250 citizens have 
arrived at the Iranian borders in extremely bad condition after 
having escaped death from Saddam Husayn's attack on the southern 
marshes. The same sources add that the fleeing citizens include 
hundreds of children and elderly people. Some of the displaced 
persons perished during the journey to the Iranian border after 
being hit with large-caliber artillery shells that followed 
them. The paper adds that the number of casualties is not known, 
but eyewitnesses among the displaced persons have stated that 
during their journey they saw many scorched and torn bodies of 
defenseless inhabitants of the marshes.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 11, IRNA -- The conference on nature 
and magnitudes of cultural assault concluded its work Monday [10 
January] after discussing the cultural, media, political, social 
and economic aspects of the issue. Speaking at the closing 
session, secretary of the conference Mohammad Hoseyn Panahi said 
that the conference was aimed at reviewing cultural assault and 
its scientific definition. 
  To identify the loopholes through which the domestic culture 
would be affected by alien cultures was among other objectives 
discussed by the participants. He called for revision in 
cultural policies of the country reasoning that present 
regulations were vulnerable and defenceless against penetration 
of foreign standards into the society. Panahi referred to 
preservation of unity and genuineness of cultural system, along 
with acceptance of useful elements in foreign cultures, as the 
main factors which should be included in the country's cultural 
strategy. 
  Experts, university professors and government officials in 
charge of cultural affairs took part in the 3-day conference 
co-sponsored by research department of the Culture and Islamic 
Guidance Ministry and Social Sciences Faculty of Allameh 
Tabataba'i University.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Interior Minister Maj. Gen. (Retd) 
Nasirullah Babar said Thursday that activists of Al-Zulfiqar 
Organisation (AZO) did get terrorist training from the Indian 
intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). 
  "Training camps were set up in Rajasthan and other areas of 
India, where many AZO activists were brain-washed and thus, they 
became RAW agents," he said during on informal chat with newsmen 
at a lunch hosted by the Senate chairman, Wasim Sajjad. 
  The minister said that RAW agents were active in Sindh. "I 
have read a report which showed that Jam Sadiq was a RAW agent." 
  "The mere fact that a political worker was lashed or 
underwent imprisonment is not a certificate for patriotism," the 
minister said when his comments were sought on the credentials 
of Suraish Kumar, a supporter of Mir Murtaza Bhutto, who was 
dubbed as a RAW agent by the government the other day, and who 
was known as a "[word indistinct] of Bhutto" in Sindh. 
  He told a questioner that Murtaza Bhutto was not involved in 
the 1961 hijacking of the PIA passenger plane and this was 
mentioned in a report prepared by the Army during the martial 
law period. "His name was then put in "Khana [list] number two 
(meant for suspects) in the FIR [first information report]." 
  "Let the time come," was his reply when asked whether the 
government would arrest Begum Nusrat Bhutto in connection with 
Wednesday's incident in Larkana. 
  "We are looking into the matter," he said when asked how did 
the RAW agents enter into Al-Murtaza, Larkana. He said he would 
ask the Sindh government why it did not take the necessary 
measures before hand to stop their entry in the residence. 
  The minister said the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] would 
not 
split and described Begum Bhutto's statement in this regard as 
just a "hubble". He said Makhdoom Khaleequzzaman and Ihtramul 
Haq had left the PPP long time back. 
  He said that the Murtaza factor would have no impact on the 
PPP in the Punjab. "When there is a change of generation there 
is a change of leadership too, but nobody can be imposed on 
workers as their leader." 
  The interior minister said the Judicial probe into the 
Larkana incident was in progress. "It will establish who opened 
the firing first. It cannot be said at this stage whether the 
provincial government failed to handle the situation." 
  He said that he received the report of the incident at 11 
a.m. on Wednesday from the Sindh government. "We were prepared 
to send reinforcement but the provincial administration did not 
ask for assistance." 
  To another question, the minister said it was the flawed 
policy of Ziaul Haq which led to the influx of foreigners in 
Pakistan. At that time, 8,000 visas were issued to the Indian 
nationals to visit Pakistan but, now, the figure has been 
restricted to 40 and the police verification has been made 
mandatory, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Gay Bekhor and Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] The first day of talks between the Israeli and 
Palestinian delegations in Taba ended in serious disagreement 
about the interpretation of the "Cairo understandings," after 
some Israeli delegates reiterated that the understandings were 
as binding on the Palestinians as an actual agreement. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Taba talks, said the Palestinians "once again categorically 
rejected the attempt to bind them to the Cairo understandings." 
According to him, "instead of making progress, the sides were 
busy yesterday with the presentation of documents and 
discussions of their interpretation, but on this issue, too, no 
agreement was reached." 
  Sha'th added: "If the Israelis raise the interpretation of 
the Cairo understandings once again, I will be certain that 
Israel is trying to hold back the talks. Until now, I thought 
we may be having trouble communicating, but after today's round 
of talks I have serious doubts." 
  He added: "If the Israeli delegation plans to entrap or 
embarrass the other side -- that is us -- or portray us as 
fools, I do not see how it plans to sign an agreement with us 
afterward." [passage omitted] 
  Sha'th disclosed to HA'ARETZ all the documents he sent to 
Major General Amnon Shahaq, the head of the Israeli delegation 
to the talks, and those he received from him. He also disclosed 
a document with Prime Minister Rabin's reservations about the 
Cairo understandings. "Did you know that Rabin also had 
reservations about them? The document contains nine 
reservations about the border crossings and the size of the 
autonomous areas in Gaza and Jericho. Rabin sent me the letter 
via Shahaq, and I never mentioned it until this moment," Sha'th 
said. 
  "Here is the famous letter I sent to Shahaq with Yasir 
'Arafat's reservations. As you see, 'Arafat has fewer 
reservations than Rabin. Therefore, these obviously are fluid 
matters. There is no agreement, and this is merely an attempt 
to entrap the Palestinians," he asserted. 
  Sha'th even disclosed that the Palestinians submitted to the 
Israeli delegation a 70-page document yesterday containing their 
updated versions of the comprehensive agreement and of the 
security protocol. According to him, "this is a compromise 
between the positions of both sides, based on the protocols of 8 
December. It is a serious effort on our part to prove that the 
negotiations in Taba can be completed within two to three weeks. 
We are now awaiting Israel's response." [passage omitted] 
  [A report by No'omi Levitzky on pages 1 and 19 of Tel Aviv 
YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 11 January notes that the document 
presented by the Palestinians yesterday "makes no mention of 
their demand to increase Jericho's autonomous area beyond the 55 
square km agreed upon in Cairo."]

  [Text] The first day of deliberations between the Israeli 
and PLO delegations ended in Taba a short time ago. The two 
sides described today's talks as satisfactory. Our 
correspondent Netan'el Semrik reports from Taba: 
  Today was the test of the immense diplomatic effort invested 
in the past few weeks in Oslo, Paris, in Cairo which was 
ultimately crowned with success. The agenda for the 
continuation of the Taba talks was set today. It was decided to 
resume the talks tomorrow morning, apparently once again in a 
limited forum. In a news conference with dozens of television 
and radio crews from all over the world, Nabil Sha'th described 
today as a useful day. Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli 
delegation, was asked whether it was a positive day: 
  [Begin recording] [Shahaq] I cannot point to any impressive 
progress today, but we exchanged ideas and picked up from where 
we left off almost two months ago. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Did you set an agenda for the 
continuation of the talks? 
  [Shahaq] We received several papers from the Palestinians 
which we will have to peruse, and we agreed on tomorrow's agenda. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Are the Cairo understandings 
included in the [words indistinct]? 
  [Shahaq] We continue to talk here on the basis of the Cairo 
understandings. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1700 GMT on 10 January 
adds: "When asked whether he believes the negotiations will be 
completed within three weeks, as Nabil Sha'th stated, Shahaq 
replied: We will continue the negotiations for as long as 
necessary."]

  [Text] Cairo, Jan 11 (AFP)--Libya handed over three 
suspected Islamic militants to the Egyptian authorities on 
Tuesday [11 January], the AL-AKHBAR daily reported here in its 
Wednesday edition. 
  The newspaper said the three were "terrorist leaders" who 
had 
infiltrated into Libya, but did not give details of their arrest. 
  They were handed over at the al-Sallum border post and then 
transferred to Cairo, where they were due to be interrogated by 
the Egyptian security services, AL-AKHBAR said. 
  Meanwhile, the AL-AHRAM newspaper reported that Egyptian 
security forces had arrested 350 suspected Islamic militants, 
mostly in Upper Egypt, during operations in the past two weeks. 
  They seized nearly 700 firearms and more than 440 
kilogrammes 
(968 pounds) of explosives, the daily said. 
  Suspected Islamic militants shot dead a police officer and 
his bodyguard in Asyut in southern Egypt on Monday. 
  It was the first killing of policemen this year, bringing to 
97 the number of policemen killed since Islamic militants 
launched a violent anti-government campaign in March 1992. 
  In a speech broadcast on state television on Monday Libyan 
leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi branded Islamic militants as 
"traitors" working for the West. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi, who has taken a hard line against the rise of 
Islamic fundamentalism, said militants were "anti-Islamic, and 
working for the enemy, backed by Western intelligence ... and 
carrying out a dangerous plot against the Arab and Islamic 
nation." 
  Among other groups, the Libyan leader singled out the 
al-Jama'ah al-Islamiah and Tala'i' al-Fath, which are at the 
forefront of the campaign to oust the government of Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhsin Jud and 'Abd-al-Nasir Karrar from Qina] </F>
  [Text] Awqaf Minister Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub has affirmed 
that Egypt's progress and prosperity depend on the strength of 
its internal front. He called on the youth to confront those 
people who advocate terrorism, whose hearts have been destroyed 
by hatred, and who are working to spread corruption and crime in 
Egypt in the name of religion, which is innocent of such crimes. 
He said such people have harmed Islam. Nevertheless, the doors 
of the state are still open for all those who have been 
misguided to return to their senses once again and join the 
Egyptian youth who are fighting for the future. 
  This was stated at the large student conference held at Qina 
University yesterday on the occasion of the opening of the 
university's cultural season. The conference was attended by 
Yahya al-Bahansawi, the governor of Qina, and some governorate 
figures. The minister added that the Governorate of Qina has 
destroyed its image due to a small alien minority which does not 
belong to it. Historically, Qina has always been known as a 
country of science, writers, and intellectuals. 
  Major General al-Bahansawi, the governor of Qina, announced 
that the state, despite its difficult economic circumstances and 
the sufferings it is going through due to the many development 
projects it is undertaking, has, nevertheless, provided a great 
deal of support and potential for Upper Egypt to decrease the 
suffering of its youth and help them lead their lives in a human 
fashion. Qina is second among the governorates as regards the 
allocation of employment projects for youths. The governor 
added that 2,392 popular mosques in Qina have been included 
under the ministry. These mosques have also been provided with 
imams who are qualified Islamically, intellectually, and 
spiritually. In addition, 2.5 million Egyptian pounds have been 
allocated to maintain, repair, and renovate the rest of the 
mosques in the governorate. Also, 2.25 million pounds were 
allocated to establish the mosques of al- Hujayrat and 
al-Humaydat -- the two towns of terrorism -- and to refurbish 
and renovate the famous archaeological mosque in the 
governorate, the mosque of 'Abd-al-Rahim al-Qina'i. The 
minister of awqaf also approved the allocation of 750,000 pounds 
to build a mosque at Qina University. The founding stone of 
this mosque was laid yesterday and it will be called the mosque 
of Martyr Major General 'Abd-al-Hamid Ghubarah, the assistant 
Qina security chief who was martyred by terrorists.

  [Text] Cairo, Jan 11 (MENA)--The Minister of Awqaf 
(religious endowments) Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub today urged that 
efforts should be made to restore Arab and Islamic unity and 
solidarity and renounce all differences so that the nation may 
regain its unity and take its rightful place under the new world 
order. 
  The minister, who was addressing a cultural meeting at 'Ayn 
Shams university, said the restoration of al-Aqsa mosque was a 
most important issue which should receive the attention of the 
Islamic world. 
  He pointed out that the al-Aqsa mosque remained under the 
protection of the Islamic world for long centuries within the 
framework of the brotherhood of mankind away from fanaticism and 
bloodshed. 
  Egypt's Islamic affiliation is an undisputed fact, the 
minister said. 
  Egypt has across history been the guardian and protector of 
the teaching of Islam. 
  The minister said that not a single law was issued in the 
(?reign) of President Husni Mubarak which was contrary to 
Shari'ah (Islamic law). 
  Any attempt to undermine Egypt's position and its pioneering 
role in the world was doomed to failure, the minister of awqaf 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Pope Shanudah, pastor of the Coptic Church </F>
in Egypt, by Sana' al-Sa'id; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Sa'id] How do you view the Vatican's 
establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel, which means a 
historic reconciliation between Christianity and Judaism? 
  [Shanudah] Do not forget that the Vatican represents a 
state, 
not just a church. The Vatican pope is a head of state and head 
of a church, and he has ambassadors in foreign countries. This, 
therefore, is not a reconciliation between Christians and Jews. 
The Vatican pope represents only the Catholics. All the others 
-- Orthodox, Protestant, and Anglican churches -- are not 
associated with this policy and have nothing to do with it. As 
for us, our dispute with the Jews is known. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Sa'id] What about reports that Coptic tourists have 
begun 
visiting Jerusalem? This contradicts your declared position 
that there will be no pilgrimage to Jerusalem before peace 
prevails and Israel pulls out of the occupied Arab territories. 
  [Shanudah] We still adhere to our declared position. We will 
not go to Jerusalem unless we all go together. Reports about 
Coptic pilgrims in Jerusalem are untrue and merely propaganda. 
We still ban travel to Jerusalem. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Sa'id] Do you fear the growing extremism and violence by 
some individuals in the country? 
  [Shanudah] We fear no one but God. And we even want to move 
from fearing God to loving Him. When we love God, we will not 
be linked to Him with feelings of fear. We want all people to 
be religious, but not extremists or fanatics. 
  [Al-Sa'id] In light of the current call for a national 
dialogue, is there a real possibility for an Islamic-Christian 
dialogue? 
  [Shanudah] The Islamic-Christian dialogue should keep away 
from creeds and focus on cooperation between Muslims and 
Christians in all fields without discussing differences of faith 
and creed. This will help people keep their love for each other. 
  [Al-Sa'id] What is the truth in saying that the Coptic 
Church 
is emotionally inclined toward the West, especially the United 
State, perhaps because they have the same religion? 
  [Shanudah] Common religion does not mean common policy. 
There are many Islamic countries, each with its own policy, and 
the same applies to Christian states. [passage omitted] 
  Another point: You may speak of a common religion, but there 
is more than one sect. While the Copts are orthodox, the 
majority of Westerners are either Protestants or Catholics. So, 
there is a sectarian difference that may cause a conflict 
between the two sides, especially since we know that foreign 
missionaries have come to Egypt and tried to convert the Copts 
by various means and ways. I wonder what emotional inclination 
you mean in your question, and toward which Western countries? 
  [Al-Sa'id] The United States. This may be because it is the 
most powerful. 
  [Shanudah] It is known that the United States supports the 
Jews, and our policy toward the Jews is known. Support for the 
Jews is something no one accepts at all. This support in itself 
indicates that differences in religion do not affect 
policymaking. The Americans and the Jews have different 
religions, but they are politically in agreement. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Algiers, 12 Jan (MENA)--Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat has warned that Israel's nonadherence to a faithful and 
meticulous implementation of its agreement with the Palestinians 
will lead to general disorder in the region. He pointed out 
that the Palestinians will not be the only party to lose from 
this disorder. He said that failing to implement the agreement 
will have a serious impact on the overall regional situation. 
  In an interview with the Algerian newspaper AL-SHA'B 
published today, 'Arafat announced that the world must know that 
this agreement is not merely a Palestinian-Israeli agreement, 
because it was signed by the U.S. secretary of state and the 
Russian foreign minister representing the sponsor countries and 
supervised by President Clinton. 
  'Arafat voiced regret that the peace sponsors have failed to 
act. 
  He reiterated his praise of the Egyptian role in promoting 
the peace process, declaring that it helped to resume the 
negotiations after they reached a deadlock in Oslo, Paris, and 
Cairo. 
  'Arafat hinted that Israel obtained full reward from the 
United States in return for signing the agreement, illustrated 
by fresh supplies of modern weapons, the largest computer in the 
world, "the giant computer," $240 million to cover its 
redeployment costs, and $10 billion in loan guarantees. Noting 
that it also obtained recognition by various countries, most 
recently the Vatican, he said it is now seeking to avoid what it 
has signed after getting the reward. 
  'Arafat remarked that the negotiations reached a deadlock 
because of Israel's ploys and its erroneous interpretations of 
the agreement's clauses. He explained that the Israelis 
maintain that withdrawal means redeployment and want to control 
the border crossings on the pretext of protecting their external 
security, which would mean that the Palestinians would live in 
"Bantustans," something that is unacceptable. 
  'Arafat continued: The Israelis cannot set traps for us. We 
know how to deal with these issues. We tell them that if they 
believe they can shirk implementing the agreement, then the 
region will go up in flames. 
  He pointed out that the attempt to resume settlement 
activity 
in Jerusalem with the Israeli Government's total support 
violates the agreement. 
  'Arafat remarked: They want to change Jerusalem's landmarks 
to make it Jewish. I say it belongs to Muslims and Christians 
everywhere. This is the first Qiblah [direction in which 
Muslims turn to pray] and the third holy mosque. 
  Commenting on the forthcoming summit between Presidents 
al-Asad and Clinton, 'Arafat said it seeks to reach an agreement 
on the Golan Heights and Lebanon and that it will carry no 
surprises. 
  Asked about inter-PLO relations, 'Arafat explained that the 
Palestinian democratic model is known. Every party, he said, 
has the right to express its view. 
  He added: We are dealing with each other well. No one 
should try to outbid the Palestinian sacrifices in blood. 
  He declared: We have endorsed pluralism and democracy. We 
defend them and fight for their sake. In this context, every 
party can express its views. 
  Asked if the Israeli stance might be backed by some Arab 
parties, 'Arafat said it could be, because the Israelis are 
trying to benefit from inter-Arab differences. 
  The Palestinian president revealed that the Palestinian 
leadership expected Israel to try to back away from the 
Washington agreement, noting that the first sign of a retraction 
occurred during the Israeli election, which brought down Shamir 
and his political program. 
  'Arafat declared that when he concluded an agreement with 
the 
Israelis he meant a "peace of the brave," adding that if they 
don't understand what "the peace of the brave" means, then there 
are many ways of making them understand.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>
  [Text] PLO Executive Committee member Yasir 'Amr expects 
the forthcoming summit between Presidents Bill Clinton and Hafiz 
al-Asad to produce positive results on all tracks of the peace 
process, particularly on the Palestinian track. 
  In a statement to AL-RA'Y, 'Amr emphasized the importance of 
Arab coordination to face the challenges of this stage, 
particularly before this important meeting. 
  'Amr also said the PLO will sign an economic agreement with 
the Egyptian Government within the next few days, and expected 
that PLO Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi, or Pan-Arab 
Department head Mahmud 'Abbas, alias Abu-Mazin, will sign this 
agreement in Cairo. 
  He said the signing of economic agreements between Palestine 
and its Arab neighbors is affirmation of its inseparable links 
with the Arab nation. He emphasized that the signing of the 
Palestinian-Jordanian economic agreement, and then the 
Palestinian-Egyptian economic agreement is evidence of the 
desire of the PLO and the Palestinian people to eliminate the 
Israeli economic hegemony after 26 years of occupation. 
  'Amr said the Palestinian objective out of signing such 
economic agreements is not to gain profits, but to entrench a 
line that the Palestinian people have been following for 
centuries, which is that they are an inseparable part of their 
Arab nation and Arab homeland. 
  He stressed that concluding this economic agreement between 
Palestine and Egypt is very important due to the past links 
between the Gaza Strip and the Egyptian Government, especially 
after the occupation of Palestine in 1948. 
  In an answer to a question, 'Amr said the Egyptian pound 
will 
not be the main currency [in the self-rule areas], and said 
Palestinian technical committees will organize all issues 
included in this agreement.

<F P=106> [Rashid Khashanah report: "Four Palestinian Leadership </F>
Members Urge 'Arafat To Change Working Methods"] 
  [Text] Tunis -- PLO Executive Committee member Samir 
Ghawshah has emphasized to AL-HAYAH that the committee has 
authorized Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi to form a national 
Palestinian dialogue committee and that it has not specified the 
names of its members. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi met with Yasir 'Arafat 
and Executive Committee members for four days this week in Tunis. 
  Ghawshah pointed out that the Executive Committee authorized 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, who submitted to the Palestinian president a 
memorandum demanding that reforms be made in PLO institutions, 
to choose members of the national dialogue committee without 
intervention from the PLO leadership. 
  He added that the Executive Committee has agreed in 
principle 
to set up a special department to develop human resources in the 
PLO and admit new capabilities to the planning council 
supervising the Palestinian planning center belonging to the PLO. 
  Ghawshah denied that the Executive Committee members are 
responsible for President 'Arafat's monopolization of power and 
decisionmaking. 
  At a press conference held in Tunis the day before yesterday 
Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi criticized the Executive Committee members, 
saying they were encouraging him ('Arafat) by keeping silent 
about his continued monopolization of power. But Ghawshah 
stressed to AL-HAYAH that he had sent to three Executive 
Committee members -- namely Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin), Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh, and Sulayman al-Najjab -- an internal memorandum to 
President 'Arafat containing four major points to change the 
leadership's working methods toward democracy. He pointed out 
that the four Executive Committee members returned recently to 
attend the committee's meetings after a period of seclusion, 
following the president's agreement to their demands, which are: 
  1. To hold the Executive Committee meetings on the basis of 
a quorum, that is half the members plus one (10 members), 
considering it the source of decisions, with the possibility of 
holding mini-meetings for consultations only, but at which no 
decisions should be made. 
  2. To reactivate the committee following up the negotiations 
and consider it the body supervising the negotiation process. 
The Executive Committee responded to this demand and decided 
officially to revive the committee, which includes Abu-Mazin 
(chairman), 'Abd-Rabbuh (deputy chairman), al-Najjab, and 
Ghawshah. 
  3. To submit a detailed report on the financial crisis in 
the PLO and to consider the Executive Committee the body 
authorized to supervise financial matters in the PLO. Juwayd 
al-Ghusayn, chairman of the Palestinian National Fund, pledged 
to submit a comprehensive report on financial conditions in the 
PLO at the Executive Committee's next meeting. 
  4. To draft the basic law of the national authority on a 
democratic basis and to lay the foundations capable of effecting 
PLO institutions. 
  At the end of last month the Executive Committee devoted 
three meetings to discussing the draft fundamental law 
(constitution). Then it referred it to Palestinian committees 
and institutions inside and in the diaspora to debate it and 
express their views. 
  At another level, Ghawshah confirmed that the Executive 
Committee will convene after the delegation headed by PLO 
Political Department head Faruq Qaddumi returns to Tunis in 
order to discuss Palestinian-Jordanian relations in the stage 
ahead.

  [Text] Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for 
the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has said the Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces [APF] will hold a meeting in Damascus on 19 
January to choose a president for the alliance and determine the 
term of the presidency of each faction, which will be periodic. 
  Ghawshah told AL-DUSTUR that the APF's decisions will be 
made 
unanimously and that any decision that is not approved 
unanimously will not be implemented. Each faction has the veto 
right. 
  Ghawshah added that Hamas will present its agenda for the 
first meeting after the formation of the APF. The agenda 
discusses the role of national conferences, the way they are 
formed, and escalating the intifadah and jihad operations inside 
the territories. 
  Hamas will also present a program of action in the Arab and 
international arenas by forming a delegation to represent the 
APF to visit Arab, Islamic, and foreign countries and explain 
the APF's view of political developments in the region and 
threats facing Jerusalem and the Palestine question. 
  It is worth mentioning that the 10 factions which oppose the 
negotiations with Israel and seek to thwart the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement last week adopted the name 
Alliance of Palestinian Forces. 
  Answering a question, Ghawshah said: The APF's membership 
was confined to representatives of the 10 factions. This means 
we have no room for independents in the APF. He added: We have 
previously suggested allocating 20 percent of the seats to 
independents, but last week the 10 factions in general were for 
the idea of accord and equal weight in the Palestinian arena.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Khatib] </F>
  [Text] Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman of the Hamas 
Movement, has said that the first meeting of the central command 
of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF] will be held in 
Damascus on 19 January 1994. 
  The APF was officially set up last week after its factions 
agreed on its political and organizational program. 
  Ghawshah rejected the argument that Hamas has conceded its 
demand for a 40 percent share of the alliance's central 
establishments. In answer to a question by AL-ASWAQ, he said: 
We, in Hamas, have declared from the beginning that we are 
committed to the formula of the 10 factions, considering this 
formula as the minimum acceptable by the Palestinian forces 
opposed to a settlement with the Zionist entity. 
  Ghawshah added: The formula that was approved is more 
advanced than that of the 10 factions although it is less than 
the one we were hoping for. In view of the insistence of some 
brothers in some factions on this formula, we decided to approve 
this formula after some members admitted that it is a phased 
formula, and that representation according to the size of each 
faction is necessary, but at later stages. 
  Ghawshah stressed that the reconstruction of the PLO 
establishments on democratic bases will take into consideration 
the size and strength of each faction after agreeing on the 
yardsticks for deciding size and strength. 
  Asked about the Hamas position on the Fatah Movement calls 
for a comprehensive national dialogue, which Dr. Haydar 
'Abd-al-Shafi was assigned to conduct, Ghawshah said: After 
reading the results of Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi's recent visit to 
Tunis, one feels the pessimism regarding the negative results 
achieved by his delegation. According to our estimates, these 
results had been expected. 
  Ghawshah added: The pragmatic Tunis leadership tried two 
months ago to send [Fatah Central Committee member] Hani 
al-Hasan to conduct a dialogue with the Palestinian opposition 
forces, but he did not succeed. Now Yasir 'Arafat is trying to 
send Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi to carry out the same role played by Hani 
al-Hasan, particularly after the setting up of the APF. 
  Ghawshah urged Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi not to embark on his 
mission, which is doomed to failure after his call for 
democratic reform fell on deaf ears. He urged 'Abd-al-Shafi to 
take the side of the popular Palestinian fold, now represented 
by the APF, which has clearly declared its forthcoming political 
tasks. Ghawshah added that meeting with 'Abd-al-Shafi and 
conducting dialogue with him depends on the approval of the 10 
factions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, general secretary of </F>
Islamic Jihad in Palestine, by Tahir Shuraytah; place and date 
not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Shuraytah] Why have you 
been refusing to meet with Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]? 
  [Al-Shaqaqi] We believe that after the Oslo accord there is 
no longer any chance left for a meeting. There is no 
significance or benefit to such a meeting. As to why this 
meeting did not take place before the accord; the main reason is 
political. We have been witnessing a continuous retreat in the 
political position in return for nothing. 
  [Shuraytah] How do you envisage the future of the self-rule 
areas from the economic and political perspectives? 
  [Al-Shaqaqi] Israel has always tried to get rid of the Gaza 
Strip. The dream or idea of throwing Gaza into the sea is not 
Rabin's or Peres'. Since the fifties at least, it has been 
Ben-Gurion's dream and idea. In practice, the Gaza Strip was 
excluded from the Labor Party's platform. Even Shamir perceived 
Israel's problem to be the Gaza Strip and its inhabitants, not 
the Arabs as a whole. He said so in one of his statements a 
year before his party lost to Labor in the recent Knesset 
elections. 
  As for the West Bank, the picture is completely different. 
The strategic importance of its range of mountains, its 
location, its religious Jewish heritage, and the settlements in 
it will make withdrawal from it now or after five years more 
complicated. Therefore, I believe that there will be two 
different models of self-rule even if the accord is implemented. 
One in Gaza, and the other in the West Bank. In both cases, 
the Israelis will try their utmost to prevent this self-rule 
from being transformed into a Palestinian state. As for the 
economic aspect, according to the declaration of principles and 
our understanding of it, the self-rule area will remain tied to 
Israel's economy. 
  [Shuraytah] What effect will the Gaza-Jericho agreement have 
on Jordan? And what is the reason for Jordanian apprehension 
concerning this agreement? 
  [Al-Shaqaqi] On the surface it seems that Jordan is the 
biggest loser. Geopolitics does not permit the establishment of 
three entities between Iraq's western borders and the 
Mediterranean Sea. The setting up of some sort of an 
independent entity in Jericho, the rest of the West Bank, and 
Gaza will be at Jordan's expense and will lead to severe tension 
in Jordan as half the population there is Palestinian. 
  Since the agreement does not give the Palestinians anything 
and does not satisfy them, Jordan will remain the solution as 
the alternative Palestinian homeland. 
  If we take into account that the West and the Jews believe 
that since its inception Jordan's role has been to absorb the 
effects of the inauspicious Balfour Declaration, this role now 
seems to be in its latest stages in the wake of an agreement 
that has given most of Palestine to the Israelis. Moreover, 
Jordan not only fears losing its role in the region, but also 
fears disintegration. This fear is reflected in the alarming 
concessions at the talks with the Israelis. The agreement's 
Palestinian team is competing with Jordan in making concessions 
to acquire this role. 
  [Shuraytah] In the event that Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] participates in the self-rule elections, what will be 
your position in view of the fact that you will remain almost 
alone in confronting the current plan? 
  [Al-Shaqaqi] The brothers in Hamas have reiterated to us 
that they oppose and will boycott these elections and that their 
position on this matter is final and decisive. In any event, 
our own position stems from our principled commitment to our 
homeland, people, and nation. It also stems from our 
understanding and analysis of the conspiracy against Palestine, 
of the facts, and of the meaning of this inauspicious agreement 
in terms of forging an alliance with the enemy against the 
nation and the entire region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ra'id Salah, mayor of Umm el Fahm and "main </F>
leader of the Islamic Movement" inside Israel, by Jamal 
Khashuqji in Jeddah; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Khashuqji] How was your visit to Saudi Arabia 
arranged and what are its aims? 
  [Salah] The purpose of the visit is to perform 'umrah [minor 
pilgrimage] with a delegation from the towns situated inside the 
Green Line (Israel). It was arranged in coordination with the 
Jordanian Awqaf Ministry. [passage omitted] 
  [Khashuqji] Let us move to politics. You have participated 
more than once in local Israeli elections. How were the results 
with regard to the Islamic tendency? 
  [Salah] Recent local government elections were held on 28 
November 1993. The Islamic Movement participated in the 
elections in several cities and villages in the Arab areas, and 
with Almighty God's help, the movement was able to win the 
mayorship in Umm el Fahm, Kafr Qasim, Kafr Bara, Jaljuliya, and 
Kafr Qari'. It also secured good and satisfactory results -- 
temporarily -- in Kafr Kanna, Rahit [as transliterated], and 
some other areas in the city of 'Akko. [passage omitted] 
  [Khashuqji] Was the peace issue and the recent accord 
included in your election program, and were you forced to talk 
about it in front of your candidates? 
  [Salah] Actually our position as Muslims has always been 
clear vis-a-vis the peace issue. Our understanding of a real 
and just peace is part of Muslims' view in life. This is why we 
as Muslims always maintain this value and adopt it not as an 
empty slogan, but as a value of belief that has a truthful, 
realistic, comprehensive, and just substance. 
  [Khashuqji] Did you talk more clearly about the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement during the elections? 
  [Salah] Without doubt a position was adopted on this plan. 
The position was defined through the numerous questions we 
raised, which have received no responsible answer from any 
official party. For example, the Gaza-Jericho plan does not 
answer questions like: What about the fate of holy Jerusalem? 
No answer. There is no clear official position on this issue. 
Or about the fate of the Palestinian refugees made homeless in 
1948 after their cities and villages were destroyed. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Khashuqji] But please allow me to ask you: Are you 
Palestinian or Israeli? 
  [Salah] I say it clearly and openly: I am a Palestinian 
Arab Muslim living on my land with no charity from anyone. 
  [Khashuqji] Have you been accused of sympathizing with 
Hamas? 
  [Salah] Yes, there are accusations by some quarters. But we 
have confirmed our clear and open position: We support 
Palestinians' rights wherever they are, whether in the West Bank 
or in the Gaza Strip or beyond these boundaries. Because we 
consider ourselves an integral part of this people, to whom we 
are bound by ties of blood, history, and religion. Without 
doubt this bond is fixed, permanent, and cannot be severed by 
anyone. So we do not deny our sympathizing and cohesion -- and 
I am not just saying sympathizing, but also cohesion -- with 
Palestinian legitimacy -- the legitimacy of the Palestinian 
people, who have the full and natural right to establish their 
state and to cling to their capital, holy Jerusalem. We do not 
hesitate to express our cohesion in many situations. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] A group of Palestinian entrepreneurs calling itself 
Falastiyah announced in Jerusalem today a huge building plan to 
set up 13 towns in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip at a cost of 
$30 million. The entrepreneurs told a Jerusalem news conference 
that they intend to start work soon. The project is to build 10 
towns on the West Bank, with 50,000 residents each, and another 
three in the Gaza Strip, with 250,000 inhabitants each. 
  Our economic affairs correspondent Menahem Friedman reports 
that the investors plan to convene an international conference 
in Jerusalem in April to be attended by official representatives 
from the United States and Russia, as well as Yasir 'Arafat, and 
Israel's prime minister and cabinet ministers, in order to 
disclose the sources which will fund the project and to recruit 
investors and donors.

  [Text] Two weeks before the holding of the national 
conference, the National Dialogue Commission [NDC] is about to 
embark on the drafting of the final version of the proposed 
document on the transition period. This follows a series of 
consultations and meetings with numerous parties, associations, 
and organizations. In this context, the NDC held a news 
conference at the El Mithak building in Algiers today. Over to 
Abdelmoumen Dekkar with this telephone dispatch: 
  [Dekkar] The meeting held between NDC rapporteur Abdelkader 
Bensalah and representatives of the national media this 
afternoon was aimed at assessing the dialogue process in its 
last stage which culminated in a series of multilateral 
meetings. These meetings are due to be concluded today with a 
meeting with professional and youth organizations. The end of 
the multilateral meetings does not mean that the door of the El 
Mithak building [NDC headquarters] will now be shut. On the 
contrary, consultations will continue between the NDC and its 
partners in the dialogue. 
  Bensalah said that regarding the subject of clearing the air 
and holding contacts with Islamic trends, the commission has 
received from the authorities concerned definite guarantees that 
a first batch of people will be released from detention centers 
in the south in the next few days. He added that the commission 
has received similar guarantees that house arrest orders will be 
lifted on all those to whom the decision applied. 
  The NDC rapporteur went on to say that these measures have 
been taken with a view to clearing the air, restoring people's 
peace of mind, and thus providing the best conditions to ensure 
the success of the national dialogue conference and achieve 
national consensus. He added that the commission hopes that 
this will be a major turning point toward the restoration of 
tranquillity and the gradual return of civil peace. 
  Talking about the pilot study undertaken in connection with 
the platform of dialogue and the reactions of some parties to 
this study, Bensalah indicated that the commission based its 
draft on the declaration of 1 November [1954], the 1989 
Constitution, and the positions expressed by the parties to the 
dialogue either in writing or verbally during numerous meetings 
with the commission. He said that the document adopts the views 
repeated by most members and added that it was impossible to 
adopt the views of all sides at the same time and include them 
in a single document. The NDC rapporteur stated that this 
document is only, as its title indicates, a pilot study; all 
parts of it are open to enrichment, amendment, and revision, he 
asserted. 
  Regarding the position of the Socialist Forces Front, which 
has decided to boycott the national conference, Bensalah said 
that the commission heard of the front's position the same way 
everyone did and that it had not been notified officially. 
However, the rapporteur added, the commission stresses its 
desire to involve everyone and not to dismiss anyone. At this 
crucial period of its history, Algeria needs the effort, 
sacrifice, and magnanimity of all its children, particularly 
those who made huge sacrifices to enable Algeria to recover its 
sovereignty and dignity, he stated. 
  We will try to give you further details on the meeting 
between the NDC rapporteur and representatives of the national 
media in our subsequent news bulletins.

<F P=106> [Statement by National Dialogue Commision spokesman </F>
Abdelkader Bensalah at a news conference in Algiers on 11 
January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] After having listened to all 
the parties in the dialogue, the National Dialogue Commission 
will remain in contact with them to consult them on several 
issues related to the contents of the platform and the national 
conference. 
  These clarifications do not prevent replies to a number of 
issues raised by the national press, citizens, or parties in the 
dialogue. Among these, we will mention the pilot study for the 
platform of dialogue with its contents. It has introduced clear 
amendments to the constitution, and in this the commission went 
beyond its powers. 
  The pilot study also included a chapter devoted to the 
economic, social, and security guidelines. In this chapter 
there were some people who said these were not enough. There 
were also those who said that by including these guidelines in 
the document, it means participation in issues that have a 
relationship with the social project. 
  Regarding the chapter on commitments, there were some people 
who said that it should remain unchanged, whereas some other 
people demanded there was a need to amend it. A third side 
raised the possibility of discarding it altogether. There were 
also those who demanded there was a need to drop the preamble 
because it came up with ideas close to the social project. 
  On this occasion the commission wishes to make the following 
clarifications: 
  The pilot study endeavored to go along with the spirit of 
the 
constitution. Those who drafted the pilot study never had an 
intention to amend the constitution. In the view of the 
commission, the constitution remains a basic reference document 
and the basic law that regulates the state's institutions. But 
the institutions of the transitional period and particularly the 
state presidency and the provisional national council are not 
elected. Therefore, they cannot occupy the same status of the 
republic presidency and the national people's assembly. 
Consequently, the powers of the interim institutions have a 
special nature, a matter which necessitated they run under 
special rules. 
  This is on the one hand. On the other hand, in view of the 
seriousness of the multi-faceted crisis and the results of this 
crisis that prevent the literal implementation of the 
constitution, and in view of the inevitability that dictates on 
us the need to provide the maximum level of success to attain 
the aims of the interim stage to ensure a return to the 
electoral course, the commission believed in its drafting of the 
pilot study. The commission also believed the implementation of 
the chapters on regulating the powers governing the transitional 
stage so that they can provide the greatest possible extent of 
effectiveness -- a matter that was misunderstood and regarded by 
some as an amendment to the constitution. In view of these 
considerations, the commission believes that this action on its 
part is in keeping with the constitution and not an amendment to 
the constitution. 
  Concerning the economic, social, and security objectives, 
the 
commission believes, on the basis of a request by the sides to 
the dialogue, that defining the economic, social, and security 
objectives is a requirement imposed by the reality of the 
transitional period. 
  The government, whose objective is to restore the country to 
normal life and civilian peace, needs general directives from 
the conference that would clarify to it the landmarks on the 
road. This led the commission to devote a chapter to this 
matter. 
  The question of enriching and amending the contents of the 
chapters remains a valid point. This is a matter to be decided 
by the sides to the dialogue in the end. The question of the 
commitments was also raised by the commission, at the request of 
the sides to the dialogue. Its aim is to make the sides to the 
dialogue committed and obligated to one another and to public 
opinion on the need to respect the essence of these undertakings. 
  The commission did not come up with these commitments on its 
own accord, but it derived them particularly from the 
constitution and from the laws enforced in the country. We have 
made these clarifications in answer to some of the questions 
raised by some sides to the dialogue and quoted by the the 
press. 
  As the commission has promised you in the past, it is still 
continuing its efforts with the aim of involving these 
tendencies. Contacts were established during the past few 
months. These contacts are still continuing. However, because 
of the private and sensitive nature of these contacts, the 
commission apologizes for not providing more details about the 
issue. Whenever it realizes there is something worth informing 
the public opinion of, it will not hesitate to inform you. 
  We are a few days away from the convening of the national 
dialogue conference. To clear the air, restore tranquillity to 
the people, and consequently make available the best conditions 
for the success of the conference and achieve national accord, 
the commission reports that it has received definite guarantees 
from the authorities concerned that a first batch of people will 
be released from [detention] centers in the south in the next 
few days. Second, it has received definite guarantees that also 
in the next few days house arrest orders will be lifted with 
regard to all those to whom the measure applies. The commission 
hopes that these measures will constitute a major turning point 
in the path leading to the restoration of peace of mind and 
gradual return to civil peace. 
  The issue of participating in the national conference has 
been in the forefront of the national press for a few days. 
[passage omitted] 
  On the eve of holding the national conference, the 
commission 
sees that this is the time for closing ranks and uniting. At 
this time, those who love Algeria and those who want the reins 
of power will come to light. This is a test period, and history 
will certainly be the judge and arbitrator. Thank you.

<F P=106> [Jamal Khasuqji report: "Anwar Haddam Tells AL-HAYAH: </F>
Contacts With Regime Stress Negotiation With Detained Leaders"] 
  [Excerpt] Anwar Haddam, member of the Algerian Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS] Executive Committee abroad, has confirmed 
the existence of contacts between the Front's leaders inside and 
outside the country on the one hand and parties from the 
Algerian Government on the other. In a statement to AL-HAYAH he 
said that these contacts are designed to arrange direct contacts 
between the ruling authority and detained FIS leaders, 
specifically Shaykhs Abbassi Madani and Ali Belhadj. 
  Haddam added that all contacts ended with informing the 
various parties and brokers that "none of the FIS leaders can 
negotiate with the ruling clique separately, and the regime must 
recognize the Front's legitimate leadership and enable the 
detained shaykhs to meet with its shura council." 
  Haddam, who currently lives in the United States, heads the 
Front's parliamentary mission, and was elected in the canceled 
elections, pointed to the existence of other new parties "which 
should be taken account of when the negotiations begin, namely 
leaders of armed action." 
  A few weeks ago the Front announced its conditions for 
negotiation, not dialogue, as it prefers to call the process. 
These conditions included releasing the Front's leaders, 
enabling them to meet with the Front's shura council, and then 
holding negotiations in a neutral country. 
  Haddam also denounced what he termed "the ruling clique's 
attempts to divide the Front's leadership by contacting 
illegitimate elements who do not belong to the FIS line." He 
added: "The regime tried to divide the Front before following 
the 1991 June incidents. It also tried to create an alternative 
leadership to the Front but its scheme failed, and any attempt 
to make contact with an illegitimate leadership is also doomed 
to fail." [passage omitted]

the agreement signed by the Palestinians and the Israelis to 
withdraw fully from Gaza and Jericho as a first step toward a 
full withdrawal from all the occupied territories and Jerusalem. 
  When the meeting was over President 'Arafat left Algiers at

  [Text] Retired Colonel Ahmed Bencherif [former minister of 
irrigation and former member of National Liberation Front 
politburo] has called on everybody to take part in the national 
dialogue and, speaking at a news conference, he described those 
who reject dialogue as being unpatriotic. Amal Meddah attended 
this news conference: 
  [Meddah] Before that, I would like to inform you that 
following its recent meeting with the National Dialogue 
Commission [NDC] the Islamic Arab Rally held a news conference 
at the club of journalists and artists, at the radio station, 
this morning to inform public opinion about the proposals made 
by this party to the NDC. [Islamic Arab Rally leader] Ali 
Zeghdoud indicated that his party has detected a certain 
flexibility and moderation in the commission's position 
regarding other parties' views. He added that there was a 
development in the dialogue since everybody, the authorities and 
opposition alike, now believes in the dialogue and regards it as 
a means to come out of the crisis. We are, he said, advocates 
and supporters of dialogue. 
  As for retired Colonel Bencherif, he said: If they entrusted 
me with the responsibility, I would manage to resolve the debt 
problem within three months and I would find a solution to the 
security problem, since I was previously in charge of security 
[as commander of the Gendarmerie], within six months provided 
that they accepted all my conditions. He added: Between 1963 
and 1979, Algeria experienced five violent convulsions, but it 
never went through the bloodshed it is going through now. 
  Bencherif seized this opportunity to ask [Higher State 
Council Chairman] Ali Kafi to release the political prisoners 
Abassi Madani [leader of the banned Islamic Salvation Front] and 
his colleagues. He also urged his friend Ait Ahmed [leader of 
the Socialist Forces Front; currently in Europe] to return to 
his country and participate in the dialogue. He also appealed 
to [FLN Secretary General] Mr. Mehri to attend the national 
conference and said in this respect: Anyone who does not take 
part in the dialogue is not a patriot.

  [Text] HAMAS [Islamic Society Movement] issued a statement 
in which it appealed to the Algerian people and all the sides in 
the opposition to shoulder the historic responsibility before 
God and before the nation. 
  In its appeal to the authority and the Islamic Salvation 
Front (FIS) and other parties and forces, Hamas underlines the 
need to participate in ending bloodshed, the destruction of 
installations, the threatening of worshipers, and for the need 
to stop statements for scoring one-upmanship and for bargaining. 
All must work for restoring tranquillity and must safeguard the 
supreme interest of the homeland.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Text] The Clinton administration has prepared a plan to 
overthrow Libyan revolution leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi 
before the middle of this year. Washington began contacts with 
European countries and rebels in south Sudan to implement a 
scheme to separate south Sudan from north Sudan and create an 
African state to protect U.S. and European interests in the Horn 
of Africa. 
  President Bill Clinton asked the National Security Council 
to 
prepare a new plan to overthrow Libyan leader Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi's regime to replace the plan that the CIA failed to 
implement last year. Sources reported that the new plan, which 
the U.S. National Security Council wants to implement before the 
middle of this year, focuses on the following factors: 
  1. Gathering the Libyan opposition forces in various parts 
of the world and agreeing with them on the "Salvation and Purge" 
plan as they call it. 
  2. Tasking U.S. ambassadors in various countries to meet 
Libyan opposition forces and discuss their requests for 
necessary funds and arms to implement the plan. 
  3. Asking particular Libyan opposition figures to hold 
contacts inside Libya with particular Libyan military commands 
qualified to participate in implementing the plan. 
  4. Agreeing with a country neighboring Libya to act as the 
assembly and staging point to carry out the plan. 
  5. Contacting particular European governments and agencies 
to participate in military and financial funding to implement 
the plan. 
  Sources asserted that a U.S. National Security Council team 
will meet figures who call themselves Libyan opposition leaders 
in Washington in the next few weeks. These figures have 
received invitations to visit Washington for this purpose. 
  A meeting was held in Washington with Sudanese rebels from 
south Sudan to prepare a plan. Washington bases its new plan 
against fraternal Sudan on the "Washington declaration" of last 
October. The U.S. Administration, which approves the secession 
of south Sudan, arranged this declaration for particular south 
Sudanese rebels. The new U.S. plan aims to incite the south 
Sudanese people to broaden their political and economic demands 
if the Sudanese Government insists on continuing the 
negotiations to solve the problem of south Sudan. The 
southerners will then escalate military operations in a bid to 
avoid Arab and African opposition to the establishment of a 
state in south Sudan and to convince African and Arab countries 
that a state in the south was established after negotiations 
with the Sudanese Government failed. The sources pointed out 
that Washington expressed a readiness for military intervention 
in favor of the southerners to implement the U.S. plan.

  [Text] Tripoli, 11 Jan (JANA) -- The Voice of America [VOA] 
has broadcast a report that Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi has 
decided to disband the Libyan General Federation of Trade 
Unions; the report was unfounded and categorically untrue. 
  JANA's local affairs editor has, however, commented on this 
matter saying: First of all, Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi is 
not a head of state or a prime minister who can take such a 
decision; the power in Libya is, in accordance with the Jamahiri 
system, in the hands of the people, who exercise legislative, 
management, and executive powers through people's congresses and 
people's committees. 
  Second, as far as the reorganization of the General 
Federation of Trade and Vocational Unions of the Great 
Jamahiriyah is concerned, this was done within the framework of 
the restructuring of the General Congress of Trade Unions in a 
bid to give fresh momentum and to consolidate trade union 
traditions within the framework of the restructuring of the 
people's congresses, in order to allow workers, as well as their 
own trade union bodies, to evaluate their affairs as well as the 
Great Jamahiriyah's foreign and local policies. 
  Third, the General Federation of Trade and Vocational Unions 
has been playing its role at Arab and international levels; it 
took part in the meetings of the central council of the 
International Federation of Arab Trade Unions in Damascus last 
month, and it is currently taking part in the proceedings of the 
International Federation of Arab Workers in Tunis. 
  Fourth, workers in the Great Jamahiriyah, who have been 
freed 
from wage slavery and the nightmare fear of the employer -- be 
it an individual or a state -- as a result of the revolution of 
producers of 1979, have become partners in management and 
production. Thus, they have achieved more than anybody else, 
who might not be able to achieve the same thing for years to 
come. [sentence as received]

<F P=106> [Report by Moti Amir in Taba] </F>
  [Text] There is no longer any dispute over the size of the 
autonomy in Jericho, which was decided on in the Cairo 
understandings. The dispute now is over the corridors the PLO 
is demanding to Jericho. In the wake of the understandings 
reached in Cairo, the Palestinians demanded three corridors be 
put under the control of the autonomy: from the holy sites of 
(al-Manta), north of Jericho; al-Nabi Musa, east of the town, 
and a corridor to the Dead Sea's Lido beach, south of Jericho. 
The Jericho issue has therefore not be resolved. 
  On the other hand, a breakthrough has apparently been made 
on 
the border crossings, on which there is agreement. Yesterday, 
the Palestinians were shown an outline of the two border 
crossings points in Jericho and Rafah. They did not react and 
up to this moment they have not disputed the main points they 
saw in the diagrams last night. 
  In the meantime, the Taba negotiations are taking place in 
two working groups. One group is discussing the joint drafting 
of an agreement. It started with the issues on which there is 
already agreement. A sort of civilian cabinet, in which the 
heads of delegation -- Amnon Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th -- are 
participating, is holding a discussion prior to the convening of 
the subcommittee on civilian affairs. 
  We have already said that there is apparently an 
Israeli-Palestinian agreement on border crossings, as well as on 
an agenda for the negotiations, and an agreement that the 
negotiations would be based on the Cairo understandings. 
  We are now waiting for the two committees to conclude their 
deliberations and for the negotiations to resume in a limited 
plenum with seven representatives from each side discussing the 
issues in dispute. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 11 January in a 
report by Netan'el Semrik quotes 'Ami Glusqa, spokesman for the 
Israeli delegation, as saying in a recorded passage: "The aim 
is to conduct businesslike negotiations in order to draft the 
understandings and agreements." The members of the Israeli 
drafting team are Foreign Ministry legal adviser Yo'el Singer, 
Brigadier General David Agmon, and Brig. Gen. Tzvi Stauber.]

<F P=106> [Report from Taba by Netan'el Semrik -- live] </F>
  [Excerpts] In a media briefing held in Taba a half an hour 
ago, Israeli elements said that no agreement has been achieved 
so far, and the sides are not even close to an agreement on any 
of the issues on the agenda. [passage omitted covered in 
referent item] 
  A mini-storm broke out after REUTER announced that an 
agreement had been achieved on the size of the Jericho area, 
with angry people rushing about making dozens of telephone 
calls. The bottom line is that no such agreement has been 
attained. 
  A short while ago, Israeli delegation sources said: The 
Cairo understandings are neither an agreement nor a signed 
document. Although the understandings are not legally binding, 
they are a fact. In addition, today's discussions revealed gaps 
in the interpretations of the understandings. 
  The chief Palestinian delegate today accused Israel of being 
unwilling to complete the draft within three weeks. 
  [Begin Nabil Sha'th recording, in English] Obviously, many 
statements have come out showing that the Israeli party is not 
ready to finish in three weeks. I repeat: If goodwill is 
there, and if the decision to reach an agreement is there, three 
weeks is enough, but if it's not there.... [end recording] 
  [In a live telephone interview earlier in the newsreel, 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres was asked by reporter 'Arad Nir 
about "chief Palestinian delegate Nabil Sha'th's implication 
that Israel is guilty of trying to stall the talks." Peres 
replied: "If our repudiating their rejection of the Cairo 
agreement means stalling, then we are stalling. I am still 
convinced that we did reach understandings in Cairo, and they 
bind both delegations."] 
  The sides also disagree on the border crossings issue, in 
addition to the size of Jericho. These two issues are now being 
discussed on the upper floor. [passage omitted]

an agreement has been reached between the Palestinian and 
Israeli delegations regarding the size of the Jericho area, 
estimated at 55 kilometers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to Israeli-Palestinian talks, by Hasan Abu-Zayid in 
Taba on 11 January, carried within "With The Events" 
program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
Palestinian delegation, has there been any progress in the talks 
with the Israeli delegation? 
  [Sha'th] Our return to Taba was aimed at achieving progress. 
We are not here to gain time or waste time. We are here to 
conclude the final agreement as soon as possible. Progress is 
faster on the level of Civil Administration and the transfer of 
civilian authority than it is on the level of security issues, 
which will take a long time and need intensive talks. We are 
doing just that. We have been discussing this all day today 
inside the drafting committees. I think it is possible to 
achieve progress and it is not a question of me being more 
optimistic or pessimistic than others, the question is 
commitment. We were committed to end these negotiations on 13 
December. There has been a delay for various reasons, but we 
are now back to where we were on 12 December, the little 
progress achieved in Cairo and Strasbourg notwithstanding. So 
why should this work take so much time? We have to finish this 
job as quickly as possible. Two or three weeks are more than 
enough provided there is a political will to finish this job at 
the necessary time. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Have you sensed such a will and a desire on the 
Israeli side? 
  [Sha'th] In fact, the head of the Israeli delegation, 
General Shahaq, has expressed optimism and stressed the need to 
reach agreement as soon as possible. I have not heard anything 
to the contrary from him. However, we hear statements from 
officials in Israel that are different from what we here from 
the negotiating team. I hope these statements are not aimed at 
exerting pressure. We should be pressing to end the work and not 
to postpone it. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: What about the border 
crossings problem? 
  [Sha'th] The border crossings issue is one of the special 
and important problems that have taken so much of our time. I 
think we can reach a solution to this problem that will meet our 
aspirations and realize national and individual dignity for the 
Palestinian citizens, as well as security for Israel and for us. 
I think we will reach agreement on this issue. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Has there been any progress in this regard? 
  [Sha'th] I believe there was some progress indeed. But we 
have not yet reached an agreement that we can sign. 
  [Abu-Zayid] And what about the size of Jericho? 
  [Sha'th] We still at the same point where we left off in 
Cairo. Of course, we hope there will be progress and I do not 
see why there shouldn't be progress. The Jericho problem can be 
discussed as part of the immediate problems, to which we give 
special attention in these talks. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Israeli sources reportedly said the Palestinians 
have dropped the Jericho area demand... 
  [Sha'th, interrupting and chuckling] I have heard that and 
that Mr. Glusca, to whom this statement was attributed, has 
disassociated himself from this position. This was communicated 
to me by General Shahaq, head of the Israeli negotiating team. 
For my part, I deny that any agreement has been reached on that 
score. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Are the Palestinians willing 
to let the settlements remain in the self-rule area? 
  [Sha'th] The Declaration of Principles reached in Oslo and 
signed in Washington provided for the settlements to remain. 
This in no way means we approve of the settlements. It means 
the fate of the settlements will await the negotiations on the 
final status of the occupied land. For the moment, the sticking 
point holding up the signing of an agreement is the exact area 
of these settlements. The Israeli side shares our position that 
the defense and security of the settlements must come from 
within these outposts. There remains the problem, though, of a 
definition of the settlements' boundaries.

  [Text] Taba, 11 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the Gaza-Jericho self-rule talks, has 
stated that there is no agreement yet on the Jericho area, 
noting that the Palestinians did not make any concessions 
regarding this issue in today's talks. 
  Speaking to journalists this evening, Sha'th pointed out 
that 
an agreement had been reached about the (?self-rule measures) in 
the fields of telephones, electricity, roads, civil register, 
economic issues, and some other issues as part of the civilian 
subcommittee work. He added that the questions of water and 
archaeology have not yet been discussed, while there is a 
dispute over the planning of urban areas. He pointed out that 
so far 20 out of 38 items on the agenda of the civilian 
subcommittee have been finalized. 
  Dr. Sha'th noted that the drafting subcommittee will begin 
its work tomorrow, Wednesday, to formulate issues related to the 
final agreement, the Palestinian authority, and legal matters. 
Sha'th stressed the need to discuss the points of difference 
during the current talks and not wait for a later stage. He 
noted that the security subcommittee, headed on the Palestinian 
side by Hasan 'Asfur, concluded its meeting today and will meet 
again tomorrow, Wednesday, in view of the important security 
issues on its agenda. Expressing optimism, Sha'th added that the 
peace process will continue so long as there is goodwill. He 
stressed that the three-week period is enough time to reach a 
draft agreement. 
  Commenting on Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' 
remarks 
today that there will be no Israeli withdrawal by 13 April as 
scheduled, Sha'th said: I know that the talks may take more 
than three weeks, but this depends on the two sides' commitment 
to reach peace.

  [Text] The head of the Palestinian delegation to the Taba 
talks, Nabil Sha'th, says there was substantial progress on the 
transfer of civil powers to the autonomous authority to be set 
up in Gaza and Jericho. Sha'th told reporters that the two 
sides formulated proposals to transfer powers of 12 Israeli 
Civil Administration departments to the Palestinians. He felt 
that within two days the entire issue could be finalized. 
  The Palestinian delegation head said also there had been 
some 
progress on security issues, but nothing was final on the 
question of the Jericho enclave area, and on the border crossing 
points. He said that the negotiations were taking place in a 
positive atmosphere.

  [Text] Taba, 11 Jan (MENA)--A slight breakthrough was made 
in the Palestinian-Israeli talks in Taba today when Dr. Nabil 
Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, and Amnon Shahaq, Israel's deputy chief of staff, 
following a closed meeting this evening agreed on the agenda of 
talks to be held by the two delegations tomorrow, Wednesday. 
  Israeli sources said after the second meeting, which 
concluded at 1800 [1600 GMT] today, the drafting committee had 
started to formulate a draft agenda in light of two papers 
submitted by the Palestinians and the Israelis. The draft 
agenda outlines the views of each party and the apparent 
differences in views over the area of Jericho, the crossing 
points, and the settlements in Gaza. 
  The Israeli source, who declined to be named, pointed out 
that the draft agenda includes all the points of difference, 
which will be left to a later stage. The source noted that the 
current round of Taba talks is expected to conclude on Wednesday 
or Thursday at the latest and that a new round of talks will be 
held on Monday in Taba. 
  Informed sources noted that the absence of 'Uzi Dayan, head 
of the General Staff's Planning Department, from today's talks 
contributed to the slight breakthrough resulting from the talks 
held between the two heads of delegations during the morning 
session. 
  From the Palestinian side, the drafting committee comprises 
'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, former commander of the Palestine 
Liberation Army; and Dr. Camille Mansur, holder of a doctorate 
in law from the Sorbonne University. The Israeli side of the 
committee includes General David Agmon, adviser to the chief of 
staff on the intifadah; Yoel Singer, Foreign Ministry legal 
adviser; and military prosecutor (Alan Shif).

<F P=106> [Report by Jo Strich] </F>
  [Excerpt] Taba, Egypt, Jan 11 (AFP)--Israel and the PLO 
began Tuesday [11 January] to draw up a list of points upon 
which they agree and differ during negotiations to implement 
autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  "A drafting committee (on military issues) has started to 
write down the subjects on which we agree and the security 
questions on which differences remain," Israel delegation 
spokesman Colonel Ami Gluska told AFP. 
  "The delegation head to the committee on civilian issues are 
doing the same," he added. 
  The military committee, made up of a jurist and a military 
officer from either side, met in a ninth floor suite of the 
Hilton hotel at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba where 
negotiations resumed on Monday. 
  Foreign ministry legal adviser Yoel Singer and General David 
Agmon, a chief-of-staff adviser on the intifadah, were drafting 
a document with Camille Mansur, an international law professor, 
and Palestine Liberation Army General 'Abd-al-Raziq al-Yahya. 
  The four face the main issues which have delayed application 
of the September 13 autonomy deal -- the size of the Jericho 
enclave and the control of borders and crossings between the 
autonomous areas and Jordan and Egypt. 
  Israeli General Gadi Zohar, head of the military 
administration in the West Bank, and Palestinian businessman 
Jamil Tarifi, met to draw up a list for the civilian committee 
which covers the transfer of powers to the Palestinian authority 
for health, education, direct taxation, social welfare and 
tourism. 
  The decision to draft a list of points was taken by Israeli 
deputy chief-of-staff General Amnon Shahaq and the PLO's Nabil 
Sha'th during a lengthy tete-a-tete in Taba on Tuesday morning. 
  It followed the suspension of negotiations on December 29 
when the PLO denied an Israeli claim that a written 
understanding had been reached in Cairo on border crossings and 
Jericho. 
  Menawhile the Palestinians continued to demand an access to 
the Dead Sea and several religious sites south of the Jericho 
enclave. 
  "We are no longer talking about square kilometres for 
Jericho," Palestinian spokesman Hasan 'Asfur said. 
  "We are demanding that certain positions in the region be 
under Palestinian control, such as religious sites, access to 
the Dead Sea, private land and areas inhabited by Palestinians," 
he said. 
  Iasraeli spokesman Gluska told AFP there was "no agreement 
with the Palestinians on the boundaries of the Jericho territory 
because there is nothing new in the PLO proposals." [passage

  [Text] Taba, 12 Jan (MENA)--The Palestinian and Israeli 
negotiators resumed their talks in Taba this morning with a 
private meeting between the heads of the Palestinian and Israeli 
delegations, Dr. Nabil Sha'th and General Amnon Shahaq. 
  The Civilian Committee met under Jamil al-Tarifi for the 
Palestinian side and Jadi Zohar for the Israeli side. The 
Security Committee met under Hasan 'Asfur for the Palestinian 
side and General 'Uzi Dayan for the Israeli side. 
  Palestinian sources have said that all the issues regarding 
the transfer of civilian authority to the Palestinian side, 
including water, antiquities, land registration, and other 
topics, could be finalized at this round of talks. Some 20 of 
39 topics on the transfer of civilian authority to the 
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and Jericho area have been 
finalized. 
  The Palestinian sources said the Security Committee will 
discuss security details, not general topics, and that it is 
hoped the Security Committee will make progress similar to the 
progress made by the committee on the transfer of civilian 
authority. The sources added that the Palestinian side wants 
"access" to the Dead Sea so that the self-rule authority will 
not feel it lives in a "ghetto" among the Israelis. 
  Palestinian sources have stated that the death of Israeli 
General Nehemya Tamari in a helicopter crash near Jerusalem 
might cause the talks to be suspended this evening. The sources 
said General Tamari was a prominent figure in the Israeli army 
and a personal friend of General Amon Shahaq and other Israeli 
delegation members, who might want to attend his funeral 
tomorrow.

"Al-Turabi Swears That Front Has Nothing To Do With Sudanese 
Regime"] 
  [Text] Khartoum -- Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, leader of the 
Sudanese National Islamic Front [NIF], swore to reporters 
yesterday that his Front has nothing to do with the present 
Sudanese regime. 
  In a news conference held in the premises of the 
government-controlled Sudanese News Agency in Khartoum 
yesterday, al-Turabi said: "You know I am not a liar. I swear 
that the NIF, which is called a national front, does not exist 
as an organization in the regime at present, either secretly or 
publicly." 
  Answering a question put by AL-HAYAH, he revealed that a 
reconciliation is being conducted between "the ruling authority 
and the popular groups." He said that leaders of the Sudanese 
parties are excluded from this reconciliation, pointing out that 
"the government always has opened its doors to anyone who joined 
the salvation efforts to rescue the country from its past 
predicament." 
  Al-Turabi also revealed that he is making contacts with 
several quarters before traveling to Afghanistan in a bid to 
achieve reconciliation among the parties to the conflict in 
Kabul. 
  He pointed out that among these quarters are the Islamic 
Salvation Front in Algeria and several European states, 
including France. 
  Commenting on the expulsion of British Ambassador Peter 
Streams from Sudan, he said: "A number of Western ambassadors 
to Khartoum told me that Ambassador Streams used to vehemently 
attack Sudan in their meetings. And perhaps the government was 
very patient with him. But it is completely unacceptable for 
him to insult it to the point of forcing Sudan's guest 
(Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey) to enter the country by 
the back door." He went on: "Britain has realized the mistake 
of its ambassador and that of the archbishop of Canterbury."

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Jan (MENA)--Palestinian Ambassador in 
Cairo Sa'id Kamal has stressed that the Egyptian Government and 
the state of Palestine have agreed to conduct a complete count 
of Palestinian refugees living in Egypt and in the diaspora 
effective 15 January. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA, Sa'id Kamal said a joint 
Palestinian-Egyptian committee met in September and decided to 
hold the count to guarantee the right of return for the 
Palestinian refugees. This step is a prelude to the meetings of 
the Palestinian-Israeli ministerial follow-up committee, which 
will discuss the Palestinian refugees problem, Kamal added. 
  The Palestine ambassador in Cairo said the count will not 
revoke the Palestinian citizen's right to live and work in 
Egypt. He noted that special forms have been prepared and will 
be distributed among the Palestinian refugees from 15 January at 
the al-Tahiri compound in Cairo and Egyptian consulates abroad. 
He said that these forms are optional, not compulsory, noting 
that the count would serve the interest of the Palestinian 
citizen. It also aims to find jobs for unemployed Palestinians 
within the framework of development programs sponsored by the 
Palestinian authority, Sa'id Kamal added. 
  In his statement, the Palestinian ambassador said that Faruq 
Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department, has instructed 
the Palestinian embassies in Arab and foreign countries to 
coordinate with the Egyptian consulates in charge of the count.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, Jan 11 (AFP)--A dispute between Iraq and 
Kuwait is delaying the return of the Organisation of Arab 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) to its Kuwait headquarters 
after an absence of more than three years, Gulf oil sources said 
on Tuesday [11 January]. 
  OAPEC moved to Cairo after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in 
August 1990. 
  Kuwait has refused to grant entry visas to the 
organisation's 
Iraqi staff, delaying a seven-month-old decision to shift back 
to Kuwait from its temporary headquarters in Cairo, the sources 
said. 
  But intensive diplomatic contacts within the 10-member group 
have made progress and OAPEC is expected to be back in Kuwait by 
June. 
  "The problem is on its way to a solution. OAPEC will start 
moving back to Kuwait in March and the shift will be completed 
by June. Procedural matters have also delayed the move," said 
one source, who is close to OAPEC. 
  Several other Arab organisations also left the emirate but 
most of them have returned since it was liberated by a U.S-led 
international coalition in February 1991. 
  The invasion prompted Kuwait and its partners in the 
six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to suspend Iraq's 
membership from all their joint groups, including the United 
Arab Shipping Company and the regional organisation for the 
protection of marine environment. 
  "The return of OAPEC to Kuwait has political implications," 
a 
Gulf source said. "It shows the situation is back to normal and 
Kuwait is again assuming its role in Arab politics, oil and 
other activities." OAPEC oil ministers decided to move back to 
Kuwait at talks in Cairo in June and they reasserted the 
decision at their conference in Damascus in November. 
  The organisation was created in Beirut in 1968 by Saudi 
Arabia, Kuwait and Libya and later it was joined by iraq, 
Algeria, Syria, Bahrain, Qatar, Egypt and the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE). Tunisia also joined the organisation but its 
membership was suspended three years ago at its request. 
  OAPEC, which is open for all Arab oil producers, was set up 
with the primary aim of promoting energy cooperation among 
members states through joint projects. Its operations do not 
cover oil production and price policies. 
  Saudi Arabia, the world's top crude exporter and producer, 
and six other OAPEC states are members of the 12-nation 
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which 
chalks out output and price policies.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article from Muscat: "Muscat: Al-Bishari Gives </F>
Bin-'Alawi Letter from Libyan Leadership; Attempt To Restore 
Diplomatic Relations Expected"] 
  [Text] Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mr. 
Yusuf Bin-'Alawi Bin-'Abdallah yesterday received Mr. Ibrahim 
al-Bishari, Libya's Permanent Representative to the Arab League 
and Coordinator of Relations with Egypt, who gave him a 
handwritten letter from the Libyan Foreign Ministry. 
  Informed sources told AL-HAYAH that al-Bishari and the Omani 
official discussed developments in the Lockerbie crisis between 
Libya and Western countries, the current Arab situation, and 
bilateral relations. 
  The sources noted that the Libyan visits and messages to 
Muscat, which ceased about one year ago, had recently resumed 
despite the limited relations between the two countries since 
the Lockerbie crisis and Libya's quest for the mediation of 
moderate Arab contries such as Oman, the Gulf states, and Egypt, 
to avoid an unequal confrontation with Western countries and 
reach a political solution to the crisis. 
  Although Oman has avoided commenting on the crisis itself, 
it 
has expressed, in a cautious and indirect manner, its 
reservations about the sanctions imposed on the "Libyan people." 
Mr. Yusuf Bin-'Alawi told AL-HAYAH, when the international 
sanctions were first imposed on Libya, that it was the Libyan 
people who would suffer from the boycott. 
  However, according to diplomatic sources in Muscat, Oman is 
not expected to play an active role in mediation efforts between 
Libyan and the West, not only because it may see a "realistic" 
chance for solving the Lockerbie crisis only through acceptance 
and implementation of the UN resolutions, but also because 
bilateral relations with Libya remain limited, and were until 
recently impaired by a certain distrust due to differing 
political stances during the 1970's and 1980's. 
  These sources believe that the Libyan envoy, who was once 
foreign minister, may have sought to move bilateral relations 
towards the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two 
countries. Libya is currently the only Arab country with which 
Muscat does not have diplomatic relations. 
  Among the things the Omanis may be interested in knowing is 
how far Libya would go in opposing the Palestinian-Israeli peace 
agreement on autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. The Sultanate 
enthusiastically supports the agreement and has sought to 
support it both in the Gulf region and the Arab world, after 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's visit to Muscat directly 
after the agreement was reached. 
  Diplomatic sources say that the message that Libya has 
received from other Arab parties--that actual opposition engaged 
in by the Libyan Government to obstruct the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement "could be an additional factor complicating chances to 
solve the Lockerbie crisis politically, and exposing Libya to 
new difficulties"--might be the same thing al-Bishari is hearing 
in his meetings with Omani officials during his visit, which 
ends today. 
  Unlike many subjects, Libya's and Oman's views on the 
current 
state of Arab relations are close. They both affirm the need for 
starting a new chapter in these relations and getting out of the 
rut of the Gulf crisis, including opening the door to Iraq's 
return, as long as it obeys the UN resolutions.

  [Excerpt] Sanaa (Agencies)--Yemen's rival factions have 
agreed to military and political measures they hope will end a 
crisis that has paralysed the government and plunged the 
troubled economy into a deeper slump, party sources said Tuesday. 
  They said a 27-man "national dialogue committee" entrusted 
with resolving differences between the northern president and 
his deputy, a southerner, agreed on the measures in Aden late on 
Monday. 
  The sources said the measures appeared to go some way 
towards 
appeasing the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) of 
Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who has stayed away from the 
capital Sanaa since July amid fears that the 1990 merger between 
North and South Yemen may be threatened. 
  The accord calls for the withdrawal of troops and military 
encampments from major Yemeni cities and the arrest of Yemenis 
suspected of involvement in a spate of political killings. 
  The YSP, which is unified Yemen's second largest party and 
ruled the former Marxist South Yemen before the merger, says at 
least 150 of its members have been assassinated in the past few 
months--the latest was a pro-YSP tribal leader killed on Friday 
in Sanaa. 
  The sources said the accord also meets a key YSP demand for 
the central bank to come under the authority of the government 
headed by the YSP's Haydar Abu Bakr al-Attas. It has so far 
been under President 'Ali Abdallah Salih, a conservative who 
ruled North Yemen until the merger. The YSP earlier rejected 
reconciliation with Mr. Salih and his General People's Congress 
(GPC), impoverished Yemen's largest party, unless steps were 
taken to implement its 18 demands. 
  Southern sources say the YSP would not be satisfied with 
promises and wanted to see concrete actions before ending its 
boycott of Mr. Salih. It says the two sides had in the past 
reached several accords which were never implemented. 
  The three parties in the ruling coalition--the YSP, GPC and 
the Islamist Islah--have been meeting with other Yemeni 
politicians in Aden for the past 10 days after holding several 
sessions of the commitee in the north. 
  Each of the three parties has five members. The committee 
also includes five opposition representatives and seven of the 
country's leading figures such as former presidents. 
  The sources said that among other points agreed were 
government spending cuts, anti-corruption measures and some 
decentralisation measures that would reduce the power of the 
central government in Sanaa. It was also agreed that a date be 
set for local elections after last year's first democratic 
general elections. [passage omitted]

  [Text] According to Yemeni political sources, rival Yemeni 
parties have reached an agreement on political and military 
measures to put an end to the crisis which has paralyzed the 
Yemeni Government. It has been learned that a 27-member 
national dialogue committee has been set up to settle the 
differences between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, head of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP], with which Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas 
is affiliated. 
  The YSP denied charges it attributed to Yemeni President 
'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih that southern Yemeni leaders are seeking to 
undermine Yemeni unity through a conspiracy with Saudi Arabia 
and Kuwait. In a statement, the YSP affirmed that it will 
continue its firm course to improve Yemen's relations with its 
neighbors and halt all practices and reactions that harm Yemen's 
relations with its neighbors and prevent the promotion of these 
relations.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, met at the Presidential 
Palace in Ta'izz today with the brother representatives of the 
expanded popular gathering comprising the sons of the 
al-Hudaydah Governorate. They briefed the brother president on 
the results of the conference, which expressed the concerns of 
the governorate's sons and their aspirations. The conference 
also stressed the sons' eagerness to preserve unity, democracy, 
and political pluralism, and called on the leadership to adhere 
to responsible and serious dialogue in order to end the 
political crisis that the country is passing through. This 
crisis has damaged the people's national interests, led by 
Yemeni unity, and inflicted various forms of economic, social, 
and psychological suffering on each Yemeni citizen. 
  They also briefed the president on the aspirations and 
demands of the governorate's sons for accomplishing many service 
projects to raise the standard of living in the governorate's 
areas. 
  The president addressed the representatives of the popular 
gathering, which included their eminence the ulema as well as 
businessmen, social figures, and representatives of political 
organizations and parties, shaykhs, and youths. He profoundly 
welcomed them, and highly praised the national sentiments shown 
by the governorate's sons who expressed their national eagerness 
to safeguard the Yemeni unity. He also blessed the results of 
the expanded gathering of the sons of the al-Hudaydah 
Governorate. 
  The president reviewed the aspects of the suffering that the 
Yemeni citizens are passing through as a result of this crisis. 
He regretted the negative results of this crisis, which were 
reflected on the community's situation and citizens' life. He 
said: These results also cracked the community and created an 
atmosphere for the enemies of unity and democracy, so they may 
express their grudge against this national achievement that was 
realized on the glorious 22 May 1990. This achievement is a 
source of pride for us in the Yemeni homeland and an 
accomplishment for all Arab unionists and the masses of our Arab 
and Islamic nation. It also showed us on the international 
level as giants. However, the enemies of unity and democracy 
have pooled their resources and efforts to undermine our unity 
and fragment the one Yemeni family. 
  The brother president added: We are pleased with meeting 
with the brother sons of the al-Hudaydah governorate, whether 
ulema, merchants, social figures, or representatives of 
political organizations and parties, whose initiative embodied 
their care for national accord. Together, and hand in hand, we 
will do our best to safeguard unity and democracy, our rescue 
ship in a violent storm. 
  Salih said: Unity is based on firm pillars, and we must 
not abandon these pillars. We have tolerated a great deal for 
the sake of unity in order to rob those who want to exacerbate 
differences the opportunity of doing so. In order to lead our 
country away from internecine struggles, we made many 
concessions in order to preserve unity out of goodwill and out 
of our sense of national responsibility and so that our people 
will not face unnecessary difficulties. However, regrettably, 
some today are trying to foment troubles in society and harden 
the people's life by escalating this crisis, whose causes and 
origin are known to our people and which led to the 
deterioration of our economic conditions and reflected on the 
general situation in the country. 
  He said: On 22 May 1990, we announced that all the files of 
the past were closed, and we decided to open a new page in the 
march of national construction so that all energies would be 
mobilized to building the new Yemen. However, some are still 
tied to the past and are thinking in the same old way. They 
have not gotten rid of this wrong view of things and have 
endeavored to foment struggles in society under many names, 
using sugar-coated words. 
  Salih noted that some of the practices have harmed unity, 
such as instigating parochialism, sectarianism, and narrow 
affiliations. He said: We always ask our people to owe 
allegiance to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity and 
to unite in facing the sectarian hatreds that harm our national 
unity. He said: Enough tampering with the national economy, 
enough corruption, enough irresponsibility that leads to social 
anarchy like the situation of 9 and 10 December 1992. This is 
unacceptable, and we will not tolerate it. We will fight all 
kinds of economic, security, and all other kinds of sabotage. 
The security authorities have been given instructions not to 
tolerate or be lenient with any saboteurs who practice violence, 
sabotage, and anarchy, threatening safety and stability in our 
society. 
  The brother chairman reviewed many developments in our 
society and noted that unity was realized on the basis of 
dialogue and equality, without a victor or vanquished and was 
not an annexation. We are all sons of the same people with equal 
rights and duties. 
  Salih said: We believed in democracy and held elections, 
letting the ballot boxes be our arbiters. We must accept the 
results. It is in the nature of democracy and pluralism that 
some parties emerge victorious and others defeated. However, 
some do not accept democracy and work against it if it does not 
work in his interests. He said: We reject all forms of 
violence, are against political and mental terror, and oppose 
all kinds of sabotage. We support dialogue and respect free 
opinion and the opinion of others, and we will extend our hand 
to all those in favor of union in order to build new Yemen, a 
democratic, united, secure, and peaceful Yemen. 
  The meeting was attended by a number of officials 
accompanying the bother chairman.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, met in Ta'izz today with 
brother representatives of the youth sector and women leaders in 
the governorate. He discussed with them a number of national 
issues and concerns related to democratic practices, and 
stressed the principle of political pluralism and respect for 
others' opinions. 
  During this meeting, the brother chairman spoke about our 
country's current political crisis and the efforts being made to 
find national solutions for the crisis to maintain the 
homeland's unity and the people's cohesion. He hoped that this 
meeting will be a new start for responsible and serious 
political action by members of the General People's Congress 
[GPC] and other national political forces to close ranks and 
confront the forces that tirelessly try to undermine the 
people's gains and the homeland's unity. He said that 
responsible political action requires everyone to work amid the 
masses, adopt their concerns, contribute toward tackling their 
issues, and embody their aspirations for the building of the 
modern Yemeni state, the state of law and order. He said that 
everyone should work to serve the country's well-being and 
progress, rather than to be involved in one-upmanship and cheap 
gains at the expense of values, principles, and national 
objectives and constants. 
  The brother chairman noted the importance of intensifying 
political activity and democratic practices and confronting the 
hostile propaganda which is aimed at breaking the social 
cohesion and undermining the homeland's unity. He said that 
unity is a great achievement for the sake of which our people 
have offered the dearest sacrifices. He said: We should move 
faster to bolster the march that we have started since the 
establishment of the GPC. This march is full of major 
achievements on all development and national levels, culminating 
in the great unity. 
  Addressing attendees, the brother chairman said: We should 
counter the biased propaganda with objective facts and tangible 
achievements. You should discuss frankly and objectively all 
aspects of corruption and counter laxity, carelessness, and all 
backward practices that harm the homeland's march and progress.

<F P=106> [Appeal issued by former South Yemen President 'Ali Nasir </F>
Muhammad from Damascus on 10 January] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate, 
I appeal to the Yemeni masses and armed forces: 
  Since the beginning of the current crisis we have been 
following the escalating developments with extreme concern. We 
had hoped that the efforts of the sincere sons of Yemen would be 
pooled to produce a solution and a way out of the stifling 
crisis which has taken hold at all levels. We have followed the 
efforts of the good Yemeni men and leaders from the various 
political forces as well as the efforts of the brothers and 
friends to promote a solution that would safeguard Yemen, its 
unity, and its democracy and spare Yemen and its people entry 
into a dark tunnel with no known end and a catastrophe the 
dimensions of which only almighty God would know. 
  We have always pointed out that a lack of a comprehensive 
strategic vision for the post-unity era would certainly lead 
Yemen to this tragic situation and that an approach by the 
political leadership to this civilized shift [unity] based on 
narrow-minded perspectives and calculations would lead everyone 
to this critical uncontrollable situation. 
  We made every possible effort to prevent the situation 
reaching the point it has now reached, and we submitted a 
serious initiative based on advanced local government that would 
preserve Yemen's unity and popular democracy and lay the 
foundations for the future. We explained that we left the 
homeland in the interest of unity and that we will remain loyal 
to that unity because we cannot forget the waves of martyrs who 
died for it nor can we forget that all the wars and infighting 
that occurred in our recent history were for the sake of unity, 
and also that we should not fight among ourselves for the 
disintegration of Yemen because history would condemn our entire 
generation for such a sin. 
  Despite all that, the crisis has deepened and the situation 
has worsened, warning of grave consequences as all institutions 
are being geared toward serving the conflict and the parties to 
the conflict, reaching the point of sharp polarization in the 
armed forces and security forces, which are being systematically 
mobilized on a divisive basis to resolve the situation. 
  Signs of explosion and infighting are looming on the horizon 
in our country, warning of a civil war that would destroy 
everything, tear Yemen and its people apart, revive all 
sectarian, partitionist, and tribal ills which were buried by 
the September, October, and great May revolutions, and destroy 
the achievements of generations of our struggle people. 
  Masses of our great people, the situation has reached a 
critical point and the time has come for the people to pronounce 
their verdict: No to infighting, no to the logic of force, no 
to the revivial of partition and totalitarian rule, and no to 
the disintegration of Yemen. 
  Here and in the name of millions of our people, I appeal to 
the political leadership to resort to reason and serious 
dialogue, which is the only option, and to begin to implement, 
step by step, what was agreed in the Dialogue Committee. I 
particularly appeal to our armed forces not to be dragged into 
that fatal conflict and not to aim their guns at any party 
because by doing that they would be aiming directly at the very 
heart of the people and their hopes and aspirations. Only the 
united voice of the people, all the people, and of their armed 
forces would safeguard unity, a resounding voice saying no to 
infighting and no to ruinous civil war, and yes to dialogue, for 
only dialogue will protect unity and democracy and maintain 
general security and stability in the region.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Search for Corpses and Disavowal of Justice"] </F>
  [Text] There are many events which an observer not only 
cannot understand but cannot believe are happening. These 
events are amusing enough to call for sorrow and are tragic 
enough to call for amusement. Perhaps the visit by a U.S. 
congressional delegation to the region to search for the corpses 
of Israeli soldiers is one of these events which calls for 
sorrow, amusement, denunciation, and much contempt. Indeed, 
such action by representatives of the American people should 
receive the aforementioned reaction and should be denounced by 
the Americans themselves. What we know is that those who are 
searching for corpses did not come to the region to investigate 
the reasons behind the bombing of the ship "Liberty" and did not 
open an investigation into this Zionist crime to show their 
voters Israel's responsibility for an Israeli crime committed 
against U.S. soldiers. Although we already know that U.S. 
policy is not based on even a minimum level of ethics and does 
not care about values and principles, this act by members of the 
U.S. Congress makes us panic over this level of ethical collapse. 
  This act by those members is no more than cheap political 
hypocrisy. If they were real representatives of the American 
people, then they would have been horrified by what is happening 
in Yugoslavia. They also would have questioned the crime 
against tens of thousands of Iraqi children and sick Iraqis who 
were martyred because of a shortage of food and medicine thanks 
to the Washington government and the administrations of 
Presidents Bush and Clinton. 
  The behavior of the U.S. Congress members puts us in a state 
of panic in terms of what is awaiting the human family under the 
new world order. While those members of Congress are busy 
searching for the corpses of Israeli killers who slaughtered 
thousands of people in Lebanon, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Tunis, 
and other countries, they do not pause at the scores of U.S. 
crimes which continue to be committed against humanity every 
minute. They also do not deem it important to say a word of 
truth in light of the human tragedies which continue to result 
in the loss of hundreds of thousands of people each day without 
moving the conscience of one Congress member or have him ask: 
Why is our country killing all those people? 
  Everything that is happening is cause for sorrow and means 
the United States is a country which possesses so many 
capabilities but only employs them to kill people and deprive 
them of security and tranquility and of food and medicine. Then 
its representatives come to our region to search for the corpses 
of killers whose Israeli military mechanism did not stop its 
wars against the Arabs for more than four decades under a 
Western racist sponsorship. The ranks of this Western racist 
sponsorship are headed by a Washington that has the mentality of 
a cowboy who is rancorous over anything that deals with good, 
security, and peace.

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali received 
in his office at the Prime Ministry today Japanese Deputy 
Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda. 
  Fukuda said they discussed the Middle East peace process and 
its prospects, in addition to bilateral relations and the need 
to consolidate bilateral cooperation in various fields. He 
expressed Japan's determination to cooperate with Jordan in all 
possible fields in the present and future, stemming from 
Jordan's political importance, known contributions, and efforts 
made in various areas to support the peace process and achieve 
regional stability. 
  Fukuda pointed out that an integrated program is currently 
being prepared on the aid Japan can extend to Jordan, so this 
aid package can take its final shape. 
  Regarding Japan's role in promoting the peace process, 
Fukuda 
said: We are determined to intervene politically in this 
process, and we seek an effective role in the multinational 
talks. He pointed out that the peace process managed to achieve 
progress, but that there are some obstacles to this process. 
However, the peace process in itself is important, sensitive, 
and historic, and useful from various aspects, he added.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali 
Tuesday [11 January] met with Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister 
Hiroshi Fukuda who reaffirmed Japan's appreciation of Jordan's 
role in the Middle East peace process and Tokyo's pledge to 
extend assitance to the Kingdom. 
  Mr. Fukuda said that during the 30-minute meeting, he made a 
general review of the developments in the peace process and 
Japanese-Jordanian relations. 
  Noting that Dr. al-Majali visited Tokyo last month and 
"impressed the (Japanese) government of the difficulties facing 
Jordan resulting from the Gulf war," Mr. Fukuda said his country 
stood ready to extend assistance to help the Kingdom overcome 
its economic difficulties. 
  Speaking in an interview with the JORDAN TIMES, Mr. Fukuda, 
who is on a Middle East visit billed as a familiarisation trip, 
recalled that his prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, had 
promised Jordan to help it alleviate its foreign debt burden. 
  "The promise meant that Japan will make more assitance 
available to Jordan since (Tokyo) is in no position to write off 
debts," Mr. Fukuda explained. Japanese assistance was discussed 
during his meeting with Dr. al-Majali, Mr. Fukuda said. But he 
declined to be specific. 
  However, he confirmed that Japan was "in the final stage" of 
granting an $80 million loan to help develop Jordan's energy 
sector. 
  "We also touched upon other potential projects and 
programmes 
which will be of mutual interest," he said. 
  Japan holds about $900 million of Jordan's $6.88 billion 
foreign debts. Most of the Japanese part of the debts is in the 
form of soft loans for long term at nominal interest rates 
extended during and after the Gulf crisis of 1990-1991. 
  Japan attaches high importance to its relations with Jordan 
because of the Kingdom's key role in the Middle East peace 
process and its "geopolitical" features, Mr. Fukuda said. 
  "We are watching with admiration the efforts demonstrated by 
Jordan to advance the peace process and also towards a free 
market economy," he said, adding that Japan also appreciated the 
Kingdom's participation in international peacekeeping operations. 
  By coincidence, he said, during a trip to the Dead Sea on 
Tuesday he met a Jordanian officer who served with the U.N. 
force in Cambodia, where Japan also maintains an army unit. 
  The officer, whose name was not immediately available, spoke 
about his time in Cambodia and of his meetings with Japanese 
counterparts, Mr. Fukuda said. 
  The encounter, the Japanese minister said, "is the kind of 
experience" that one enjoys and gives an added personal 
dimension to bilateral relations. 
  In the broader context of Japanese contribution to the 
Middle East peace process, Mr. Fukuda noted that Tokyo has 
pledged $200 million in assistance to support the Palestinian 
self-rule envisaged under the Sept. 13 Israel-Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) deal. 
  "This is not a political statement, but a firm commitment," 
he said, adding that $25 million of the aid were already 
disbursed in the public health and health sectors in the 
occupied territories. 
  "We are in a hurry to disburse the rest of the amount, and 
we 
are in continuous contact with the World Bank and others," he 
said. 
  Asked whether Japan shared a reported international feeling 
that there are no "credible" Palestinian institutions to channel 
the more than $2.2 billion aid pledged at a donor's conference 
in October, Mr. Fukuda said: 
  "The legal requirement of the Japanese assistance has to be 
met; afterall it is tax-payers' money. We have to be satisfied 
on our side that the...assistance is spent for the purpose for 
which it has been allocated and intended." 
  Mr. Fukuda, who arrived here Monday overland from Israel 
through the occupied West Bank, said he had met with Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, his deputy Yosi Beilin and other 
Israeli officials as well as Palestinian leaders in the occupied 
territories, including members and advisors of the peace 
negotiating team. 
  "These meetings were very enlightening to me," given the 
fact 
that it is the first visit to the Middle East after taking 
office, Mr. Fukuda said. 
  Japan is playing a key role in the multilateral phase of the 
Middle East peace process. in addition to chairing the 
multilateral working group on the environment, it is 
vice-chairman of the committee on regional economic cooperation 
and water. 
  Japan is also a member of the working groups on refugees and 
arms control. 
  Japanese officials accompanying Mr. Fukuda said two meetings 
were planned in Cairo next month, of consultative committees of 
the multilateral phase, to discuss "a series of specific ideas" 
for specific projects involving regional cooperation in various 
fields. 
  Asked how he viewed the progress of the peace negotiations 
between the Arabs and Israel, Mr. Fukuda said: "It is important 
to be optimistic." 
  Expressing hope that the peace talks would eventually lead 
to 
a just and fair peace settlement in the region, he added: 
"Nobody is going to benefit from failure (of the peace 
process), but everybody will lose from failure."

  [Excerpts] Amman, PETRA--Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali has met with foreign journalists at the Prime Ministry 
and answered questions about the latest regional and local 
political developments. [passage omitted] 
  Concerning reports on a joint Moroccan-Bahraini initiative 
to 
achieve reconciliation between Jordan and Saudi Arabia, the 
prime minister said that such an initiative constitutes a good 
opportunity which Jordan welcomes, especially since it is in 
harmony with the policy of reconciliation, particularly with the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with which we have joint neighborly 
relations and interests, and which plays an effective role in 
the Gulf region. He added that the relations with Kuwait might 
need a longer time. 
  About Jordan's relations with Iraq, the prime minister said: 
The fraternal Iraqi people have suffered a great deal and are 
still suffering. We should all, in the Arab homeland, seek to 
alleviate their suffering. 
  He stressed that our relations with all the Arab states are 
based on mutual respect and on noninterference in the others' 
affairs. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Resuming Taba Negotiations and Israel's </F>
Intentions"] 
  [Text] Finally, the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have 
resumed in the Egyptian resort of Taba after an 11-day hiatus, 
amid signs that Israel plans to prolong the negotiations. The 
Rabin government has asserted that negotiations on the 
Palestinian-Israeli track could last two months. The 
Palestinian side, however, does not think there is any need for 
the negotiations to last more than three weeks. 
  Apparently, Israel does not plan to reach an agreement with 
the PLO anytime soon. This is driving it to obstruct the 
negotiations. Israel has repeatedly said that it will not 
relinquish sovereignty over the crossings and the bridges and 
will not abandon direct supervision of Jewish settlements in the 
self-rule region, nor will it change its position on the size of 
Jericho. In brief, Israel has already started to create 
problems and concentrate on disputed issues. 
  It could be that Israel wants to paralyze its negotiations 
with the PLO to see the outcome of the al-Asad-Clinton summit 
and the situation on the Syrian-Israeli track and how this is 
going to affect the peace process on all tracks. Israel is thus 
capitalizing on the weak coordination between the Arab cordon 
states and the suspension of negotiations on some tracks. 
  Since the Madrid conference, the Rabin government has been 
seeking to divide the peace process and conclude separate peace 
treaties with certain Arab parties. This government will 
continue to exploit the weak coordination between the Arab 
cordon states and the weakness of their negotiating cards. 
  The Arab cordon states should therefore take note of the 
intentions of the Rabin government and enhance and deepen their 
coordination to restore credibility. The Rabin government has 
worked hard to sow distrust among the Arab parties. 
  It is worth mentioning that Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
Palestinian negotiating team, has denied Israeli claims that 
Jordan objects to Palestinian supervision of the crossings. 
  It is important that the Arab cordon states should be 
vigilant and alert to Israeli attempts to destroy Arab 
coordination and conclude separate agreements that will prove 
unacceptable to future Arab generations.

<F P=106> [AL-ASWAQ report on "new witness" in trial of defendents </F>
accused in the assassination attempt on king] 
  [Text] The State Security Court held a session yesterday 
evening under military judge Lieutenant General Hafiz Amin, the 
court president. The court continued to look into the case of 
the defendants accused of belonging to al-Tahrir [Liberation] 
Party. The court summoned a new witness who testified before the 
court panel and the defense representatives. The defense 
representatives objected to the testimony of the witness, 
arguing that the case had already been referred to the panel for 
a final verdict. Besides, the defense representatives were not 
informed of the name of the witness in advance. Some of the 
defendants parents objected to the witness. This prompted the 
president of the court to order them to leave the courtroom. 
  The session lasted five hours. The court is expected to 
issue a verdict next Sunday. It is worth mentioning that the 
decisions of the State Security Court are not final. The 
decisions, along with all the papers of the case, will be 
referred to the Court of Appeals. 
  PETRA reported that the court heard testimony from the court 
witness, a bailiff who wrote down the minutes of the 
investigation. The bailiff asserted that the prosecutor of the 
State Security Court, after identifying himself to the 
defendants, read them the charges and their rights before they 
made any statements at the military judiciary building, and that 
no other parties were present. When the defense lawyers asked 
the bailiff about the way the defendants were brought to the 
military court, there was debate between the defense lawyer and 
the public prosecutor. Afterward, some 20 attendees left the 
courtroom after making threats and disrupting order. 
  On their way out, these people attacked court guards, 
smashed 
windows, and banged wooden doors and walls. Immediately, the 
court president ordered that they be arrested for disrupting 
order and committing an act punishable by law. He ordered that 
those people be referred to competent agencies for interrogation.

  [Text] Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has decided to 
license a party called the Pan-Arab Action Front Party [Hizb 
Jabhat al-'Amal al-Qawmi]. 
  Party spokesman Lawyer Salim al-Suways said: The licensing 
of our party by the Interior Ministry at a time when the Arab 
homeland is undergoing difficult circumstances comes as a real 
test and a challenge, which we will face according to our 
pan-Arab constants by entrenching effective organizational 
structures capable of absorbing changes. We do not want to be 
just another number in the list of licensed party. Moreover, we 
do not want to become an elite organization; we seek to be a 
popular pan-Arab instrument. 
  He added: We believe that the establishment of the Pan-Arab 
Action Front Party, which includes pan-Arab parties and figures, 
is an attempt to rebel against the deteriorating and fragmented 
situation of the pan-Arab forces in Jordan and the Arab 
homeland. This situation weakened these forces and robbed them 
of their political influence. The pan-Arab forces, which seek 
to achieve unity and democracy, should not remain divided and in 
conflict. While we assert that we are a channel for pan-Arab 
struggle, we hope to be the melting pot for pan-Arab forces on 
the road toward the establishment of a united pan-Arab front. 
  Lawyer al-Suways added that the Pan-Arab Action Front Party 
is a result of the unity of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, the 
United Organization [al-tanzim al-muwahhad], the Jordanian 
Revolutionary People's Party, the progressive democratic and 
pan-Arab forces, the Arab popular liberation movement in Jordan, 
in addition to a group of independent national figures. 
  The party formed a leadership council of 27 members and an 
executive committee of 11 members. It also formed a number of 
party bureaus. The party will continue to call on the national 
parties and figures to continue dialogue in order to achieve 
unity and form a broad pan-Arab front. 
  It is worth noting that the party's executive committee 
consists of Muhammad al-Zu'bi, the secretary general; Ahmad 
Muhammad Ibrahim, also known as Abu-'Isa, assistant secretary 
general and head of the political affairs bureau; Shams 
'Abd-al-Karim, assistant secretary general and head of the 
organizational bureau; 'Ali al-Hamshari, assistant secretary 
general and head of the information bureau; Salim al-Suways, the 
media spokesman; Mahmud al-Nawayisah, head of the cultural 
bureau; Majid Mahafizah, secretary of the executive committee; 
'Adnan Mansur, official in charge of financial affairs; Burayk 
al-Hadid, head of the popular organizations bureau; Hani 
al-Dahlah; and Fayiz al-'Adwan.

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri has declined 
to receive the U.S. Congress delegation out of respect for the 
U.S. law that bans U.S. Congressmen from visiting Lebanon, as he 
announced today. 
  Parallel to this position, the delegation's visit created a 
wave of criticism among party circles, which saw in the visit a 
disdain for the dignity of the Lebanese people because the 
delegation's mission was confined to searching for Israeli 
soldiers while ignoring the destiny of Lebanese detainees and 
captives in Israeli prisons.

  [Text] Commenting on the U.S. Congress team's visit to 
Lebanon, Ja'farite Mufti Shaykh 'Abd-al-Amir Qabalan said it 
demonstrates the continuing U.S. partiality toward the Israeli 
enemy. He said the team's principal concerns are the remains of 
the Israelis and the whereabouts of the Israeli pilot. 
  Mufti Qabalan added that the Lebanese and Arab detainees who 
are suffering in Israeli prisons are of no value in the American 
view. Shaykh Qabalan called for releasing the Lebanese detainees 
if the Americans wish to show signs of goodwill.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud al-Zayyat from Sidon] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned that the Palestinian detainee 
Yasir al-Shuraydi, whose extradition is requested by the German 
authorities for alleged involvement in the bombing of a 
discotheque in Berlin in 1986 that killed three Americans is in 
a Tyre prison on charges of attempted murder and forgery and may 
face fresh charges in seven pending cases. 
  It has been learned that several charges against al-Suraydi 
were dropped due to insufficient evidence. However, he is 
expected to face further charges in several other cases and will 
stand public trial later this month. 
  You will recall that in 1983, when al-Shuraydi lived in 
Libya, Germany called on that country to extradite him. He was 
later implicated in the murder of a Libyan citizen called 
Mustafa al-'Ashiq. Al-Shuraydi, born in 1959 and a resident of 
'Ayn al-Hulwah camp, hails from the al-Safsaf, a village in 
northern Palestine. 
  South Public Prosecutor Justice Hatim Madi commented on the 
German request for al-Shuraydi's extradition, saying: "The issue 
of extradition depends on whether the legal conditions for 
extradition are met. It also depends on the strength of the 
case against the defendant. Following the interrogation of the 
person whose extradition is requested, the Higher Court's public 
prosecutor is to refer his file to the justice minister together 
with a report." 
  Justice Madi added: "Extradition can be effected by a 
cabinet decree passed upon the recommendation of the justice 
minister. I do not think that there is an international 
extradition treaty between Lebanon and Germany. In this case, 
Articles 30 to 36 of the Lebanese penal code, governing the 
extradition of criminals between countries, would apply." 
  Justice Madi said: "As long as an individual is facing trial 
in a Lebanese court he cannot be extradited, because Lebanese 
law should take precedence. If the extradition of a prisoner is 
requested for a certain crime, we will not try him for that 
crime, but it have to wait until he serves his prison sentence 
before we look into the crime for which his extradition is 
requested."

  [Text] Baghdad, Jan 11 (INA)--Minister of trade said over 
the past year, his ministry has succeeded in achieving a state 
of self-sufficiency in staple food and commodities. 
  Dr. Muhammad Mahdi Salih added that the ministry has managed 
to provide Iraqi and Arab people and foreign nationals resident 
in Iraq with food ration and supply the local market with basic 
goods and commodities. 
  The minister noted that the cost of food items covered by 
the 
ration card stands at some 90 million dollars a month, 
indicating that in accordance with the ration system, the 
government distributes some 30,000 tonnes of food per month 
conveyed and transported by some 10,000 trucks of some 30 tonnes 
loading capacity each. 
  Dr. Salih went on to say that food subsidies amount to one 
and a half billion dinars annually. 
  The minister elaborated that in 1993, the ministry added new 
food items to the ration card and increased others, indicating 
that rations of sugar, vegetable oils and tea have increased by 
some 25 per cent over the past year. 
  He added that the ministry's staff have rebuilt some 139 
projects damaged by allied air and missile attacks during the 
war and acts of terrorism and sabotage that followed, indicating 
that the said projects include silos, mills, granaries and 
warehouses. 
  The cost of the reconstruction work on the ministry's 
war-wrecked facilities and projects amounts to ID [Iraqi Dinars] 
29 million, the minister said, noting that the estimate cost of 
work was ID 50 million. 
  Moreover, the ministry has licenced the establishment of 120 
companies of the private sector with a capital of ID 90 million 
to help provide basic goods and commodities.

  [Text] Baghdad, 12 Jan (INA) -- Vice President Taha Yasin 
Ramadan today received a written message from Jordanian Prime

and enhance its relations with fraternal Jordan. 
  The Jordanian minister of energy and mineral wealth praised

  [Text] Baghdad, 12 Jan (INA)--Iraqi-Jordanian oil talks 
began here today. Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad headed the 
Iraqi side to the talks, while Minister of Energy and Mineral 
Resources Walid Mithqal 'Asfur led the Jordanian side. During 
the meeting, both sides reviewed bilateral cooperation in the

and promoting this cooperation in the interest of the two 
fraternal countries through the exchange of expertise and 
technical advice. 
  At the outset of the session, Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi 
Jawad reviewed with the fraternal Jordanian delegation the 
expertise and added capabilities acquired by technical and 
engineering cadres of the oil sector as a result of their 
counteroffensive to rebuild the oil and economic installations 
the evildoers destroyed during the vicious 30-state aggression 
against Iraq. 
  The Jordanian minister expressed his admiration of the 
Iraqis' capabilities and innovations. He appreciated their 
implementation of several giant projects, drawing on their 
intrinsic potential, although the unfair anti-Iraq embargo 
continues to be enforced. 
  Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Jawad Hadi said that the Oil Ministry 
is ready to provide fraternal Jordan with expertise and 
technical advice in the field of oil industries. 
  The Jordanian oil delegation arrived here yesterday on a 
visit of several days. 
  Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Jawad Hadi met earlier in the day 
with 
the Jordanian minister of energy and mineral resources and the 
delegation accompanying him. During the meeting, they discussed 
fraternal bilateral ties in the oil industries, and the means of 
promoting them. 
  Today, Transport and Communications Minister Ahmad Murtada 
Ahmad also met with Jordanian Energy and Mineral Resources 
Minister Walid Mithqal 'Asfur and his delegation. 
  During the meeting, they discussed cooperation between the 
two fraternal countries, particularly on transportation and

  [Text] Baghdad, Jan 10 (INA)--Four Arab countries and 
Turkey would sign shortly in Baghdad an agreement to connect 
their power grids. A source at the Ministry of Industry and 
Mineral told THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER. 
  Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Turkey will hold a meeting in 
Baghdad on January 15 to agree that each two neighbouring 
countries of the five can connect their national grids. 
  The aim of the project which was ratified in Ankara in 1989 
by ministers of these five countries in charge of electricity is 
to make available a power reserve that can be used by any of the 
five countries and the exchange of power among these countries 
particularly at the times of peak in power consumption. 
  For example, in Iraq the peak in power consumption is during 
summer while in Turkey the peak is in winter. So, these two 
countries can exchange power. 
  Baghdad meeting which will be attended by directors-general 
of electricity in the five countries will also discuss 
feasibility studies of the project. 
  The source said the first phase of the project is expected 
to 
start in 1995 and each country would start to extend its power 
to bordering areas.

  [Text] Baghdad, 10 Jan (INA) -- President Saddam Husayn has 
received a cable from Staff General Husayn Kamil Hasan, minister 
of industry and minerals, in which he conveyed to his excellency 
the good news about accomplishing the strategic carbon black 
project that will provide raw material to build the national 
industry. 
  The cable said: This project enabled our men to hold the key 
to modern technology through purely national efforts and 
programmed, creative action. This action displayed the most 
marvelous pictures of resolve and determination and incorporated 
boldness and science and knowledge which characterize the sons 
of Iraq. 
  The cable added that this strategic project will provide raw 
material to build the national industry, especially in 
manufacturing tires, batteries, inks, and various dyes. 
  The cable asserted that accomplishing this strategic project 
means taming [tarwid] crude oil and its derivatives, and even 
taming the sacred Iraqi soil in its great wealth and abundant 
water. This project opened up new horizons to the creative Iraqi 
mind. It is indeed the ax of the creative people that will 
smash the embargo and teach the enemies a profound lesson and 
will make them regret their reckless blockade. 
  Staff Gen. Husayn Kamil Hasan said this major project has a 
capacity of 25,000 tonnes annually. This will meet Iraq's needs 
of carbon black in various industries. Iraq used to import this 
material using hard currency, paying $1000-3000 per tonne. This 
means that Iraq is ready to help its brothers and friends in the 
oil countries in this field to break the monopoly and activate 
constructive cooperation and mutual interests.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that Israel 
and the Palestinians already agree that they shall receive full 
autonomy, but he insists that this will not include 
responsibility for security and foreign affairs. Reporter Jack 
Katzenell asked him if at the Taba talks Israel will be prepared 
for new concessions on the size of the Jericho enclave: 
  [Begin recording] [Peres] Well, the size of Jericho was 
decided and I don't believe this is an open question. 
  [Katzenell] For the first time today, Israeli officials 
described the Cairo document not as an agreement, but an 
understanding. 
  [Peres] I don't know who described it, and I don't know what 
is the difference between understanding and agreement. You 
cannot agree unless you understand, and you cannot understand 
unless you agree, so what is the difference? 
  [Katzenell] Does it mean that Israel will be more flexible 
on the issue of the border crossing points, or the size of the 
Jericho enclave? 
  [Peres] Israel is flexible all the time on the crossing 
points. It cannot be flexible on the security issues. On that 
Israel will remain as it was in the Cairo talks. 
  [Katzenell] This evening Dr. Nabil Sha'th said that there 
was no progress on any of the main issues, after at lunch time 
[as heard] the Israeli sources suggested that an agreement had 
been reached. Is Israel indulging in wishful thinking, or is it 
a bad communication again with the Palestinians?

<F P=106> [Report by Tzvi Singer] </F>
  [Text] A master plan to set up a dense settlement bloc, 
which would make Jerusalem the center of a built-up area from 
Ma'ale Adumim in the east to the 'Etzyon Bloc in the south, is 
currently in the process of being approved. 
  The main effort is focused on linking Ma'ale Adumim and 
Jerusalem in order to create a single populated bloc. The 
Ministries of Defense, Interior, Construction and Housing, and 
Industry and Trade are behind the plan. It was approved by the 
Civil Administration's Supreme Planning Council after receiving 
the approval of the committee dealing with exceptional cases, 
headed by Noah Kinarti, the defense minister's assistant on 
settlement matters. 
  If implemented, the plan will be the first stage in the 
establishment of a new settlement bloc to be called the Adumim 
Bloc. It will include the town of Ma'ale Adumim, Kfar Adumim, 
Mitzpe Yeriho, and Qedar. Under the plan, the bloc will be 
linked to Jerusalem through uninterrupted construction along the 
new highway linking Ma'ale Adumim with the capital. After 
completion the distance between Ma'ale Adumim's municipal 
boundary and that of Jerusalem (the Pisgat Ze'ev neighborhood) 
will be some 400 meters, which means that in fact it will be a 
single bloc. 
  The planned construction will include housing, hotels, and 
commercial building over an area of some 5,000 dunams. It will 
come under Ma'ale Adumim's jurisdiction, along the highway to 
Jerusalem, where there are no Arab villages, except for 
(al-Zayyam) -- which under the plan will remain outside the area 
of construction. 
  The Ma'ale Adumim Municipality wants to extend the plan 
eastward toward Mitzpe Yeriho and the other Jewish settlements 
in the area, but it does not have the backing of the relevant 
government ministries for that. 
  According to Ma'ale Adumim Mayor Beni Kasri'el, the plan has 
the blessing and support of Ministers 'Uzi Bar'am and Binyamin 
Ben- Eli'ezer and the support of "the government's and Labor's 
right-wing flank," in addition to that of leading opposition 
Knesset members. 
  At the same time, a similar plan is being prepared for the 
'Etzyon Bloc, linking it to the Green Line through the 
establishment of new settlements. In the first stage, a new 
settlement will be set up near the 'Adulam Bloc and the 
paramilitary outpost of Giv'ot, located between the 'Etzyon Bloc 
and the settlement of Betar 'Elit, which will be civilianized. 
  The 'Etzyon Bloc plan, prepared with the Jewish Agency's 
Settlement Department, has already been presented to Minister 
Shim'on Shetrit, and according to regional council head Shilo 
Gal has already received his blessing. It will be presented to 
the construction minister later in the month. 
  The plan is based on the idea of setting up territorial 
contiguity between the bloc and the Greater Jerusalem area by 
building on state lands in areas not populated by Arab 
settlements. 
  North of Jerusalem, a plan to expand the municipal area of 
Giv'at Ze'ev up to the Ramot neighborhood in north Jerusalem is 
in advanced stages of being approved. Giv'at Ze'ev's current 
municipal area stretches to the foothills of al-Nabi Samu'il, a 
distance of only 150 meters -- as the crow flies -- from 
Jerusalem's boundary, but privately-owned Arab land stand in the 
way of the planners.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: The talks held by the foreign ministers 
of the signatories of the Damascus Declaration over the past two 
days turned into a show of solidarity with Syria and support for 
its efforts to restore Arab territories and rights and reach a 
just and comprehensive peace in the region. 
  The foreign ministers informed His Excellency President 
Hafiz 
al-Asad of their countries' complete support and recognition of 
Syria's pan-Arab orientation. Their closing statement also took 
note of Syria's visible and vital role in the peace process and 
the importance of the upcoming Geneva summit between Presidents 
Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. They expressed the hope that 
the session will advance a just and comprehensive peace based on 
UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, the 
land-for-peace formula, an Israeli pullout from all the occupied 
Arab territories, and the restoration of Palestinian rights. 
President al-Asad made it clear to the Arab foreign ministers 
that Syria will continue to be driven by the same pan-Arab 
policies it has set for itself; namely to defend Arab rights and 
pursue a just and universal peace in the region. Thus, the Arab 
foreign ministers who came to Damascus to voice their solidarity 
with Syria and its stands, have, in effect, confirmed President 
al-Asad as a spokesman for the Arab nation and a champion of its 
rights and causes in the planned summit with the U.S. president. 
As well as being Syria's roaring voice, Al-Asad will be the 
voice of all the Arabs and the true articulator of their 
aspirations. Against the background of a stalled Middle East 
peace process, Arabs across the Arab world naturally attach the 
highest importance to this summit. Israel has been trying to 
deal with the Arab states one at a time and promote partial 
settlements and separate deals that can hardly lead to peace or 
meet the aspirations of Arab masses. Syria has won the 
international community over to its argument that a Middle East 
settlement found lacking in justice and universality is doomed. 
That Mr. Clinton is going to a summit in Geneva shows that the 
United States is sold on the idea of a just and universal peace 
and a central role for Syria, not only in its own right, but 
also as a spokesman for all the Arabs and a repository for their 
hopes and aspirations. 
  The genuine support voiced by the Arabs for Syria's agenda 
and al-Asad's pan-Arab orientations will make the historic 
Geneva session even more important. Assuming that the session 
proves useful, it will give a fresh impetus to the peace process 
and advance a just and universal peace and put the stalled talks 
back on track. However, if the summit is to succeed the United 
States will have to further implementation of the UN Security 
Council resolutions -- the principles on which the Madrid 
conference and the Washington talks were launched. These 
resolutions are absolutely clear on a number of key issues: A 
total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, a 
halt to Jewish settlement building there, and the restoration of 
Palestinian rights. The Americans themselves have summed these 
up as the land-for-peace formula. 
  The Washington talks were an opportunity for Israel to climb 
on the bandwagon of the Middle East peace process. But Israel 
has deliberately passed up all the chances to make peace, 
choosing land grabbing and repression over peace and 
tranquility. It has almost wrecked all the American peacemaking 
efforts and led the region to the brink of an explosion. 
  It is high time Israel showed a real interest in peace and 
the international community moved to impose a just and universal 
peace and force Israel from all occupied Arab territory.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] AL-BA'TH highlights the important upcoming summit 
between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. It notes 
comments by Swiss papers, which highlight this meeting, 
considering it a major event, expressing hope that the meeting 
will achieve its desired objectives and give great momentum to 
the peace process. 
  AL-BA'TH notes various media reports about Syria's major, 
key 
role in the peace process. Syria not only defends its national 
interests. It also strongly defends all Arab interests. U.S. 
President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
were the first to note that there can be no peace in the region 
without Syria. 
  The paper adds: It is common knowledge that Syria, as the 
entire world has acknowledged, contributed to the convening of 
the Madrid conference. Syria still believes that the Madrid 
formula remains the basis in any real endeavor to establish a 
just and comprehensive peace. Syria has repeatedly said that a 
comprehensive solution alone would lead to peace and stability 
in the region. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: The Geneva summit between Presidents 
Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton is extremely important. As many 
observers think, the summit comes at a time when the peace 
process has reached a dead end because of Israel's rejection of 
the Madrid formula and its refusal to implement international 
resolutions that stipulate full withdrawal from the occupied 
Arab territories. Therefore, the whole world hopes the Geneva 
summit will give new momentum to the stalled peace process. To 
achieve this, the U.S. Administration is required to take a 
firmer stance to consolidate the principle of international 
legitimacy. 
  AL-THAWRAH says the world is looking in the direction of 
Geneva and is anxiously awaiting the convening of the summit 
between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton and its 
results, which, it is hoped, will usher in a new stage of 
U.S.-Syrian ties and cooperation regarding the peace process. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds that the nature of the issues and hot topics 
that will be discussed, in addition to other issues which the 
two presidents are expected to address, will make the summit 
meeting a historic event and a major turning point, especially 
in light of the constant, principled positions of al-Asad's 
Syria toward these issues. These positions, as everybody has 
acknowledged, are now firmly embraced by the world. This 
confirms the credibility of Syrian policy and its sound approach. 
  The summit reflects a clear recognition of Syria's 
important, 
central, and weighty role. It is also a U.S. and international 
confirmation that Syria is a major party to the Middle East 
equation, a major interlocutor, and truly embodies hopes and 
aspirations for the liberation of lands and restoration of 
rights. 
  AL-THAWRAH asserts that leader al-Asad is a man of constants 
and difficult historic positions in difficult times. He has 
proven under all circumstances, and in an age of stormy changes 
and developments, that he is the person most capable of steering 
the nation's ship toward a safe shore. Al-Asad is going to 
Geneva to speak in the name of all Arabs. The nation which 
authorized him realizes that he is its faithful son and honest 
leader who can be entrusted with issues concerning future and 
destiny. 
  While stressing the importance of the summit and the fact 
that it is a juncture between war and peace, its success depends 
on the U.S. side which sponsored the peace process and which is 
authorized by the international community and how much it is 
willing to pressure Israel to rectify the course of the peace 
process, abide by the Madrid point of reference and formula, and 
adhere to all resolutions of international legitimacy. Any 
other wager that does not take into consideration a radical 
change in Israeli positions and performance toward peace is an 
illusion and self-deception that will not lead to any result.

<F P=106> [Article by Joseph Samahah: "Summit Scenario"] </F>
  [Text] The summit meeting between Presidents Bill Clinton 
and Hafiz al-Asad is important, but perhaps less important than 
the Syrian media services are saying. However, these 
exaggerations are not supposed to lead to the opposite of what 
they are intended for. The Syrian president can put numerous 
cards on the negotiating table: the hitch in the implementation 
of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement, commitment to Lebanon 
seriously and the resistance card tacitly, preservation of a 
form of Arab boycott [of Israel], the relationship with Iran and 
Iraqi opposition parties, support for the 10 [Palestinian] 
factions [opposed to the peace process], the U.S. need for 
stability in the region, Israel's willingness to accept a kind 
of regional settlement, "tolerance" toward Syrian Jews and 
efforts to facilitate the Congress committee's work, the absence 
of any serious challenge to the existing [Syrian] authority 
which declares its willingess to accept a comprehensive solution 
that returns the occupied territory, and so on... 
  On the other hand, the U.S. President will not forget that 
he 
is in possession of precious negotiation cards: the absence of 
the Soviet Union, the general Arab weakness which has worsened 
since the Gulf war, the lack of credibility of the Syrian 
military power -- which means there is no nonpolitical option, 
Israel's breakthroughs in recent months under the U.S. plan to 
seize the region by the "collar," possible Turkish pressures, 
the Syrian economic situation, and so on... 
  These equations give rise to expectations, given that this 
kind of meeting usually ends up with a tacit, not detailed, 
agreement. On that basis, and in accordance with what is 
generally accepted and common, the following scenario can be 
proposed: 
  A. President al-Asad explains the peace concept he would 
accept as a beginning for discussing the other issues. He hands 
this card to Clinton in response to successive Israeli 
statements, the most recent of which is Rabin's statement 
linking the concept of peace with the scale of the withdrawal. 
This leads to opening the door to the negotiations in 
Washington so that the new round will lead to a declaration of 
principles linking Syrian sovereignty over the Golan and the 
peace -- that is in accordance with a timetable that could take 
years to implement. An integrated solution, but phased 
implementation. 
  B. The Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon coincides with a 
cosmetic Syrian redeployment under which Damascus would continue 
to have the upper hand at the security and political level. 
Here the logic of the the Lebanese-Syrian treaty would dominate 
and none of the agreements signed between the two countries or 
those to be signed in the future would be affected. In this 
way, Washington will have recognized Syria's regional influence 
in return for the "share" Israel has won through the accord with 
the PLO and which it will obtain if a Middle Eastern market is 
established. 
  C. U.S.-Syrian relations enter a new phase whose theme is 
the removal of Syria's name from the list of the states 
supporting terrorism in return for steps that reshape Damascus' 
relations with the Lebanese and Palestinian forces opposed to 
the peace process. In this connection Washington can be content 
with encouraging the features of the Syrian economic opening-up, 
without pausing much at the continuation of political control. 
  These are general ideas trying to precede the almost certain 
positive results of this summit. It seems that the Palestinian 
issue now belongs to Yitzhaq Rabin's "jurisdiction" and that 
Lebanon is a topic on the U.S.-Syrian agenda, and that the 
margin of choice is now narrowing with regard to Jordan. All 
these parties attended the al-Asad-Carter summit in 1977 and the 
al-Asad-Bush summit in 1990. True, the equations have changed 
and Syria's regional influence has declined to some extent, but 
the matter did not reach the point of confining discussions to 
the Golan only.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Today's press commentaries focus on the summit 
meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton in Geneva 
mid-January. 
  Under the headline "The Madrid Formula is the Basis," 
AL-BA'TH says: Undoubtedly, the entire world is showing great 
interest in the summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. AL-BA'TH indicates that U.S. political 
circles are showing special interest in the summit. Considering 
it a major event in the peace process, these circles pin hopes 
on it as an effort to achieve real progress toward the aspired 
peace. Noting U.S. political circles' statements, the paper 
says that these statements affirm that the importance of the 
Geneva summit stems from the issues that will be raised for 
discussion. The U.S. political circles believe that the summit 
will discuss very substantial and meaningful issues, especially 
since President Hafiz al-Asad will emphasize the stipulations of 
the Madrid peace conference. These stipulations stress a 
comprehensive solution through the implementation of the UN 
resolutions which call for a full, comprehensive withdrawal from 
the occupied Arab territories. 
  AL-BA'TH says that Syria went to the Madrid conference and 
then to the Washington talks with a specific and clear vision of 
the nature of peace. A few days from now, Syria will go to the 
Geneva summit with the same view because of its absolute faith 
in the need to work to establish a just, comprehensive regional 
peace which will guarantee Arab rights. The paper says that 
despite all that has happened and all that might happen, Syria 
will not change its stands concerning the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
This is because Syria is fully convinced that without a full, 
comprehensive withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories, it 
is impossible to achieve a just, comprehensive peace. 
  Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: The prerequisites and 
requirements of a genuine peace are known and clear. He who 
wants such a peace to prevail will only have to abide by 
implementing the contents of the Madrid formula, which will 
continue to be the basic pillar of any effort to achieve a just, 
comprehensive peace. 
  TISHRIN also comments on the al-Asad-Clinton summit. It 
affirms that the summit will give a very strong boost to the 
peace process. This is because, according to U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, Syria is a main player in the region 
and has a very important role with regard to the achievement of 
a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
  TISHRIN adds that this U.S. acknowledgement of Syria's 
sincere cooperation to render the peace process successful did 
not rise from a vacuum. Rather, it is based on the experiences 
of two years of talks in Washington, during which Syria provided 
an example in the quest for a just, comprehensive peace in the 
Middle East. Only a genuine peace can hold fast in the face of 
events and changes. The paper says that Syria has never sought 
separate deals, nor has it been involved in maneuvers or 
bargains. Rather, its main concern is to establish a firm peace 
which leads to a Middle East peace and improves the world peace 
climate. For over two years, Syria has warned against the 
course of separate deals and unequivocally proved that such 
deals do not make peace. 
  TISHRIN adds: Syria's past and present announcements are 
shared and approved by all peace advocates. Syria firmly 
believes that for peace to hold in the face of events and 
developments, it should be just, fair, and comprehensive. A 
just, comprehensive peace requires Israel's full withdrawal from 
the occupied Arab territories and recognizing the Palestinian 
people's basic rights. 
  TISHRIN indicates that Syria has a genuine interest in 
peace, as does the United States and the world. Stability in 
the Middle East is vital for world stability. World peace will 
remain incomplete without peace in the Middle East. However, 
peace does not depend on Syria and the Arab parties alone. It 
requires a substantial change in the Israeli position and a 
categorical Israeli commitment to the implementation of relevant 
UN Security Council resolutions, something which has not 
happened so far. 
  Concluding its comment, the paper says that for its part, 
Syria will do all it can in the interest of a just, 
comprehensive peace. In this context, the United States is 
called upon to employ its influence, which is very great, to 
make Israel accept the resolutions of the international 
legitimacy as a basis and a framework for peace leading to the 
establishment of rights and an end to the occupation and the 
acts of repression and terrorism against the Palestinian people. 
  On the same subject, AL-THAWRAH runs a commentary under the 
headline "The Summit of Hope." It says: On the eve of 
President Clinton's European tour, which he will conclude with 
the summit meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva, U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher emphasized Syria's important role 
in the quest for a comprehensive peace in the region. He said 
that this pivotal role renders the Geneva summit extremely 
important, something that will affect the overall peace process. 
He also reiterated his country's commitment to an honest and 
sincere full-partner role. 
  AL-THWARAH believes that what Christopher has said reflects 
the unchanging U.S. position on the issue of a comprehensive and 
just peace on all fronts of the conflict. It also proves that 
Washington is not convinced of the usefulness of partial 
solutions and separate deals that are held in secret and away 
from the formula and bases of the Madrid conference. 
  The paper says that although it welcomed the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement, the U.S. Administration still believes that any 
attempt to impose an incomplete solution that bypasses Syria's 
role and that is not in line with its vision and concept of the 
nature, bases, and requirements of peace, will have grave 
consequences for the region's security and stability. 
  AL-THAWRAH says that the U.S. Administration is certainly 
aware of Syria's credibility in the peace process and the extent 
of Syria's seriousness about working to establish the aspired 
peace.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The Issue is in Safe Hands," 
AL-THAWRAH writes about the atmosphere preceding the awaited 
summit between President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton mid-January. AL-THAWRAH says: Perhaps it is not 
surprising that we are seeing desperate attempts and various 
techniques to disturb the summit. In this context, we 
understand Israel's statements--or rather threats--yesterday 
about a military escalation in southern Lebanon on the eve of 
the summit to influence its results within the framework of a 
persistent endeavor to change its results or derail it. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds that yesterday's statements by an Israeli 
military commander concerning an escalation in Lebanon and 
attributing such an escalation to a Syrian wish to strengthen 
its position, as he alleges, are an explicit Israeli threat to 
hold Syria responsible for the consequences in advance. 
  AL-THAWRAH affirms that such attempts will not cease. The 
Israeli circles and the media under their influence are not 
short of means to put pressure on the summit in an attempt to 
confuse the U.S. decisions that Clinton will carry to Geneva. 
This is especially since, based on experience, they know well 
who Hafiz al-Asad is and what exceptional communication skills 
he possesses, skills that will enable him to convince President 
Clinton of the fairness of our cause and of our nation's right 
to restore the occupied territories. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Fairness and rights are the central issue 
that this exceptional leader, Hafiz al-Asad, will carry to the 
Geneva summit. They realize, and so does the entire world, that 
Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva is not Syria's president and not an 
interlocutor with Clinton on behalf of Syria. Rather, the 
importance of the summit basically stems from the fact that 
President al-Asad will not speak for or represent Syria alone. 
Nay, he is the pan-Arab president who will carry the entire 
pan-Arab issue to the table of negotiations with Clinton in 
Geneva. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: That is what al-Asad stands for, that is 
what he represents, and that is how he dealt with the three 
other U.S. Presidents with whom he met -- Nixon, Carter, and 
Bush. The issues that the three other summits dealt with were 
in fact comprehensive, pan-Arab issues concerning the right of 
all Arabs to peace and fairness. The upcoming summit will also 
be like this. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Here again, is the exceptional 
importance of the upcoming Geneva summit. The entire world is 
aware of the exceptional importance of this summit, and it is 
definitely so. 
  TISHRIN comments on the recent Israeli statements expecting 
an escalation of tension in southern Lebanon prior to the 
Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva mid-January. TISHRIN explains that 
Israel has never ceased its attacks on Lebanon. Hardly a day 
goes by without a southern Lebanese village being subjected to 
artillery shelling or an air raid. 
  TISHRIN affirms that Israel is dissatisfied with the 
convocation of the Syrian-U.S. summit. This is simply because 
the objective of the summit is to boost the process leading to a 
comprehensive Middle East peace. Israel does not want peace. 
It wants to firmly entrench the occupation, continue the 
settlement activity, and drag Arab sides into separate deals, 
such as the case with the Palestinian side. Israel also wants 
to inflame the situation in southern Lebanon. This, the Israeli 
officials believe, would help cast doubts about the usefulness 
of the Syrian-U.S. summit. 
  TISHRIN says that if Israel is really interested in peace 
rather than inflaming and exploding the situation, why does it 
not accept the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and 
cooperate with the U.S. initiative and international efforts to 
establish a firm, durable, and comprehensive Middle East peace? 
Why does Israel not help render U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
move successful by declaring its readiness to fully withdraw its 
troops from the occupied Arab territories and to trade these 
territories with a genuine, firm peace? 
  TISHRIN says: Syria and Lebanon have spent two years of 
talks in Washington, but they saw nothing from the Israelis 
except maneuvering, procrastination, and security pretexts. 
This is as if Israel's security can only be ensured by 
threatening the security of Syria and Lebanon and by continuing 
the occupation of their territories. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: Needless to say, Israel's record 
in southern Lebanon is black and full of crimes. The Lebanese 
have not yet forgotten the deportation of the entire population 
of the south during the recent aggression nor Israel's public 
announcement that it wants to create a new refugee problem in 
the Middle East. Proceeding from these facts, the Lebanese rule 
out nothing. Israel is experienced in aggression and in 
pretending to be an innocent victim.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is 
again whistling the old tune on the nature of peace. As usual, 
he claimed that Syria has not clarified the nature of the peace 
it seeks to establish in the region and adds that Israel will 
not agree to a complete withdrawal from the Golan and to the 
evacuation of the settlements but to a withdrawal on the Golan 
in exchange for a complete peace. 
  The truth is that, since the launching of the U.S. 
initiative, Syria has explained that it aspires to a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region and to the settlement of all 
the aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Syria has submitted 
practical, objective, and balanced proposals since the sixth 
round to translate the UN Security Council resolutions and the 
peace for land principle into tangible reality. Syria, also 
announced through its foreign minister that it is ready for a 
full peace in exchange for a full withdrawal. However, the 
Israeli officials who have done their best since the Madrid 
conference to undermine the Washington talks and raise obstacles 
and obstructions have so far rejected the formula of a just and 
comprehensive peace. They did not abide by the UN Security 
Council resolutions and insist on partial settlements and peace 
in installments. When Rabin speaks about withdrawal on the 
Golan, he refers to a partial and limited withdrawal and wants a 
full peace in return. 
  This is so in spite of the fact that Syria had informed all 
the parties concerned that the Golan is nonnegotiable and that 
peace depends on Israel's full withdrawal. Rabin wants to share 
the Golan with Syria. The Golan has been Syrian land since time 
immemorial and cannot be divided. The UN Security Council 
resolutions are clear. They demand a full Israeli withdrawal, do 
not permit the forcible seizure of the land of others, reject 
the settlement operations and the transformation of the 
landmarks of the occupied territories. 
  Syria is fully committed to the implementation of 
Resolutions 
242 and 338, which are the basis of the peace process. Has 
Israel done the same? Rabin speaks on every occasion about a 
withdrawal on the Golan and not from the Golan. Thus, he places 
an insurmountable obstacle before the attainment of any progress 
on the Syrian track. Syria has announced on every occasion that 
it rejects partial deals and aspires for a comprehensive peace. 
Why then does Rabin insist on phased partial settlements and 
peace in installments? Rabin, actually plans to swallow up part 
of the Golan. It goes without saying that Syria will not be 
dragged into such deformed and mutilated settlements and will 
not give up any inch of its territory. Rabin's statements seek 
to raise doubts about the feasibility of the Syrian-U.S. summit 
scheduled to be held in Geneva in the middle of this month. 
Everyone knows that the United States seeks a comprehensive 
peace and is in accord with Syria on this. Comprehensive peace 
cannot be established without Israel's full withdrawal, the 
removal of the occupation, and the elimination of the 
settlements in accordance with the international legitimacy 
resolutions and the principle of exchanging land for peace. 
But, Israel refuses to withdraw, insists on occupation, and 
resorts, as usual, to the pretext of security. Security and 
expansion go together with respect to the Israeli rulers. They 
have launched many wars of expansion under the pretext of 
security. They reject peace now under the pretext of security. 
What peace are they talking about if it will not lead to the 
elimination of the occupation, the return of the land, and the 
entrenchment of the right of the dispersed and the refugees to 
return to their land and properties? 
  Perhaps, we can see the type of peace Israel wants through 
the negotiations resulting from the Gaza-Jericho accord. Israel 
has not conceded a single essential thing to the Palestinians. 
It insists on entrenching its occupation and hegemony and its 
control over the crossings, routes, areas, and the Palestinian 
people's resources. 
  Everyone agrees that occupation is the opposite of peace. 
Although the Palestinian side became involved in Israel's 
schemes, it soon reaped the bitter fruits. It found itself face 
to face with an endless series of operations of deception and 
misleading actions. 
  Syria will certainly not be dragged into such agreements and 
insists on the meticulous implementation of the UN Security 
Council resolutions. It will pay no heed to any Israeli 
proposals that do not contain a full and comprehensive 
withdrawal from the Golan.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Ibrahim Hamra, chief rabbi of the </F>
Jewish community in Syria, by Ibrahim Humaydi in Damascus; date 
not given] 
  [Text] Ibrahim Hamra, chief rabbi of the Jewish community 
in Syria, has said that Syrian authorities have granted 550 exit 
visas to Syrian Jews wishing to leave the country. He stressed 
that "no restrictions" are imposed on Jews in Syria and that 
they are treated like other Syrians. 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Hamra pointed out that since 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to Damascus 
and his meeting with President Hafiz al-Asad, after which 
facilities for Syrian Jews were announced, "some 550 exit visas 
have been issued at the rate of 30 a day." He pointed out that 
350 Jews have not received visas yet, and "I believe that their 
visas will be issued before the Syrian-U.S. summit, although 
most of those who have obtained exit visas will not leave the 
country." 
  On the facilities offered to Syrian Jews after the recent 
al-Asad-Christopher meeting, Hamra said: "Actually there have 
never been restrictions on the Jews' travel in al-Asad's era. 
But it is to do with red tape, administrative matters, and 
bureaucracy. The president's instructions have led to speeding 
up matters in this connection." 
  He added that in the past any Jew wishing to travel had to 
deposit a financial guarantee ranging between 10,000 and 15,000 
Syrian pounds in the Central Bank, and entire families used to 
be banned from traveling. 
  He stressed that there are now no restrictions, and 
instructions were issued by President al-Asad after his meeting 
with Rabbi Hamra in April 1992, lifting all the restrictions. 
"We can now obtain passports valid for six years and a one-year 
multiple exit visa without paying any financial guarantee." 
  He added that in President al-Asad's era we have "enjoyed 
our 
dignity and freedom in trade, religion, and culture in every 
sense of the word." He pointed out that in April 1992 President 
al-Asad issued an amnesty for sentenced Jews and that "the past 
was dark for Jews." 
  Rabbi Hamra pointed out that since the new instructions were 
issued most Jews have traveled abroad, especially to Brooklyn in 
the United States, and that some 1,250 Jews out of about 4,000 
have stayed in the country. Most of them live in Damascus and 
in al-Amin Street (1,000 Jews). About 250 Jews live in Aleppo 
and al-Qamishli and enjoy religious freedom, as there are 22 
synagogues in the Syrian capital, two in Aleppo, and one in 
al-Qamishli. He also said that some of the Jews who left the 
country have returned because they could not live abroad. 
"About 100 people and 10 families have returned, even though 
some of them stayed abroad for some 14 months," while some of 
the Jews who have been granted exit visas have not left the 
country. 
  On his expectations for the Syrian-U.S. summit to be held in 
the middle of this month, the rabbi said in the interview, which 
was conducted at the "Jewish School" in al-Amin Street: "I hope 
all the exit visas will be issued before the meeting. I do not 
want this issue to be raised in it. I want the meeting to be 
devoted to issues more important than us." He added: "The time 
allocated to the meeting should be devoted to more important 
questions than this issue, because it is resolved." 
  The rabbi stressed that the "Golan Heights are Syrian 
territory and must be returned to us as Syrians." He added: "I 
do not want the Jews issue to assume any political dimension. 
All I want is to defend the rights of my country (Syria) and 
the rights of the community." 
  He expressed his hope that peace will be established in the 
Middle East Region after the Clinton-al-Asad meeting. "I hope 
that the results will be positive so that nothing will prevent 
any Israeli Jew from visiting Syria or any Syrian Jew from 
visiting Israel." He expressed his hope that there would be no 
"barriers" in the future, stressing that this can be achieved 
through "a comprehensive and just peace based on complete 
withdrawal from the occupied Syrian territory." 
  Asked whether any Syrian Jew has gone to Israel, Rabbi Hamra 
said: "I do not believe that any of them has gone there. 
During my stay in New York I did not hear that any of them is 
there." However, he pointed out that the Syrian Jews present in 
Israel are emigrants who left at the beginning of the century. 
This emigration included Syrians of other religions, as about 
40,000 Jews "went there before 1948." 
  He pointed out that he will soon go to the United States to 
meet his children and wife who are there, to look after the 
affairs of the community there, and "to attend the engagement of 
my daughter, whose fiance I want to be Syrian, even though we 
are allowed to marry from others." He added that no U.S. rabbi 
understands Syrian Jews "like I do, because I have been with 
them since 1976," after succeeding former Rabbi Nasib Andibu [as 
transliterated].

<F P=106> [By Suman Chattopadhya] </F>
  [Text] Dhaka, 29 December -- It is not known how the 
Indian commerce minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, currently 
visiting Bangladesh will describe his experiences in Dhaka to 
Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. During his two-day visit to Dhaka 
to attend the Joint Economic Commission [JEC] meeting it has 
become clear to Mr. Mukherjee that Bangladesh is not willing to 
reach any understanding with India on any issue unless the 
problem relating to the sharing of the waters of the River 
Ganges is resolved. At present Dhaka's only appeal to Delhi is 
to resolve the water issue. It is not willing to discuss any 
other bilateral issues with Delhi until the Ganges water issue 
is resolved. 
  The representatives of Bangladesh did not raise the water 
sharing problem during the JEC meeting held in Dhaka as this 
issue does not come within the purview of the commission. 
However, this issue figured prominently during the talks which 
Mr. Mukherjee had with Bangladeshi leaders outside the JEC 
meeting. The Ganges water issue came up for discussion and 
dominated virtually all of the hour-long meeting which Mr. 
Mukherjee had with Prime Minister Khaleda Zia in Dhaka on 
December 28. The prime minister requested the Indian minister 
to see for himself the damage caused to Bangladesh due to the 
nonavailability of the Ganges waters. She urged the Indian 
minister to take a personal initiative for a speedy resolution 
of this issue. Similar sentiments were voiced by other 
Bangladeshi leaders when Mr. Mukherjee called on them. 
  The problem relating to the sharing of the Ganges waters 
with 
India is a major issue in the politics of Bangladesh. Because 
of it, the ruling party is reluctant to extend its hands of 
friendship to India until the problem is resolved. A close aide 
of the Bangladesh prime minister has said that if the BNP 
[Bangladesh Nationalist Party] Government is unable to reach an 
honorable settlement of the water dispute with India before the 
next general elections, then the party will have to face bitter 
criticism from its opponents. It would be harmful for the BNP 
to accept the proposals given by India on other issues before 
resolving the water dispute. The next general elections in 
Bangladesh will be held after two years. 
  Due to this unwillingness of the government, none of the 
proposals given by India during the JEC meeting, which concluded 
in Dhaka on December 29, were accepted by the Bangladesh 
delegation. The proposals which were given by Pranab Mukherjee, 
who led the Indian delegation to the talks, include: 1) signing 
of a border trade agreement to prevent illegal trade; 2) signing 
of a motor vehicles agreement to ensure smooth movement of goods 
from each other's country by road; 3) the provision of transit 
facilities to India for the transportation of goods to its 
northeastern states through Bangladesh. Apart from the above 
proposals, India also proposed the setting up of two working 
groups to resolve various matters relating to trade and use of 
the common border. Though extensive discussions were held on 
these proposals at the JEC meeting, the Bangladesh side later 
declined to accept any of them. 
  The joint press conference at the end of the JEC meeting was 
addressed by the Bangladesh foreign minister, Mustafizur Rahman, 
and the leader of the Indian delegation, Pranab Mukherjee. At 
this press conference the two sides announced that they had 
decided to reduce the trade gap between the two countries. With 
this end in view, the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation of 
India will import 150,000 tons of urea fertilizer from 
Bangladesh during the next fiscal year. 
  It may be mentioned that the relationship between India and 
Bangladesh is not likely to improve unless both the countries 
decide to change their current stand. It is the undeclared 
policy of Bangladesh that it will not negotiate with India on 
any issue unless the Ganges water problem is resolved. India's 
position is that the relationship between the two countries will 
improve after a consensus is reached on various outstanding 
issues. Given the prevailing situation, the Indian Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao is likely to visit Dhaka soon. This 
visit is likely to take place at the end of January or early 
February.

  [Text] The Bangladesh economy achieved more success and 
stability in 1992-93 following the reforms undertaken by the 
government and the growth during the year was higher as compared 
to the previous year in spite of the recessionary trend in the 
developed world. The inflation reduced drastically to record 
low at 1.3 percent in 1992-93, said the annual report of the 
Bangladesh Bank for 1992-93 released on Wednesday [5 January]. 
  The Bangladesh Bank report said that the foreign exchange 
reserve in the country registered an unprecedented increase at 
2,121 million U.S. dollar equivalent to six months' import 
expenditure in 1992-93. But the report depicted a dismal 
picture in the total investment and said that it did not achieve 
the desired success in spite of the deregulation and free market 
economic policies. The reasons for the low investment were 
attributed to dilatory process in the implementation of the 
policies, rigid and extra cautious stand of the banking 
institutions, strict lending policies without risks and 
introduction of harder rules in the realisation of the bank 
loans. Total law and order situation and the labour unrest were 
also shown in the report as other reasons for the slow 
investment. The entrepreneurs apprehending tough competition in 
the liberalised foreign trade did not show adequate interest for 
investment, the Bangladesh Bank report observed. 
  The rate of the Gross Domestic Production (GDP) registered a 
growth of 4.3 per cent as against 4.2 per cent in the previous 
year. The per capita income in 1992-93 stood at 212 U.S. dollar 
as against 208 U.S. dollar in 1991-92. The report said that the 
demand for bank loans remained tremendously low as the 
investment did not gain momentum. 
  The broad money supply registered a rise of only 10.6 per 
cent reaching a total of Taka 31,535.6 crore. The money supply 
increased by Taka 3,009.7 crore in 1992-93. 
  The foreign exchange reserve in the country registered a 
rise 
by 513 million dollar. The rise included receipt of 81 million 
dollar from International Monetary Fund (IMF), 30 million from 
IDA [International Development Association], 59 million dollar 
from Japan. Above that the rise in the remittances from the 
Bangladesh expatriates and export earning were 84 million and 
234 million dollar respectively. The import expenditure 
increased by 523 million dollar in 1992-93. The reserve money 
in the Bangladesh Bank increased by Taka 2,082.7 crore. The 
huge cash of the commercial banks and financial institutions was 
deposited with the Bangladesh Bank since they could not invest 
it in the economic activities. 
  The export earnings in 1992-93 increased by 12.3 per cent 
over the previous year. The total earning from the export 
during the year was 2,138 million dollar. The deficit in the 
current account balance increased to 780 million dollar in 
1992-93 from the previous 605 million dollar. The overall 
surplus in the balance fell by 19 million dollar and stood at 
595 million dollar from 614 million dollar. 
  A total of Taka 814 crore was disbursed in the country as 
agricultural loan as against Taka 749.59 crore in 1991-92. 
  In the foreign trade the deficit in 1992-93 rose by 289 
million dollar and stood at total 1,848 million dollar. In 
spite of the increase of 234 million dollar in export earning 
the import expenditure was higher by 523 million dollar. 
  In 1992-93, the export earning was 2,138 million dollar 
while 
the import expenditure was 3,980 million dollar leaving a total 
deficit of 1,848 million dollar. 
  The report apprehended that the effort to make the country 
self-reliant in food production might be obstructed as the 
farmers failed to make over the production cost of their 
produce. This would constraint them to use increased inputs 
including adequate fertilizer, seeds and pesticides.

  [Text] India today dismissed as motivated Pakistan's threat 
of a nuclear war in South Asia if the Kashmir issue is not 
resolved peacefully. Responding to queries from newsmen on 
Pakistan foreign minister's statement in Uzbekistan, an External 
Affairs Ministry spokesman said in New Delhi that Islamabad has 
only one-point agenda. Its repeated stand on Kashmir issue is 
also well-known. He said on the other hand, India's position on 
the issue is crystal clear. Responding to a question, he said 
India is always open for negotiations to resolve all the 
outstanding disputes with Pakistan.

<F P=106> [By Bal Krishna] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 1: Pakistan has accumulated 
sufficient quantity of weapon grade uranium but its nuclear bomb 
programme is facing serious problems as the country is finding 
it hard to procure or develop command and control mechanism to 
trigger and deliver the nuclear device, according to an 
assessment made by nuclear science experts here. 
  The experts say Pakistan might have several hundred kgs of 
weapon grade uranium against the minimum requirement of 15 kg of 
enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb. But the strategic 
effectiveness of the Pakistan's nuclear weapons will ultimately 
depend not so much upon their explosive power as upon the 
indetectability and accuracy of the delivery system. 
  The experts say since Pakistan has successfully produced 
highly enriched uranium, little would apparently stand in the 
way of its manufacturing nuclear arms except the time that would 
be needed to develop command and control mechanism to trigger 
and deliver the nuclear bomb. 
  They say now Pakistan's efforts to obtain nuclear weapons 
have gone beyond its production of highly enriched uranium. It 
has been actively working on nuclear weapons design problems and 
on the explosive triggering mechanisms and delivery system of 
nuclear weapons. 
  Shortly after Pokhran test by India in 1974, the experts 
say, 
Pakistan launched a separate effort to acquire the capability 
for producing highly enriched uranium, the alternative material 
usable for nuclear weapons. 
  The key to this secret endeavour was Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan, a 
Pakistani metallurgical engineer who later became Chief of 
Pakistan's Atomic Energy Agency. From 1972 to 1975, Mr. Khan 
worked in the metallurgical section of a Dutch engineering firm, 
the Physical Dynamics Research Laboratory whose parent company 
was playing a key role in an ultracentrifuge uranium enrichment 
plant under construction in the town of Almelo in the 
Netherlands. The facility was built by the British Dutch-West 
Germany consortium `URENCO' to produce low enriched nuclear 
power plant fuel. 
  The experts say subsequently it was revealed that Mr. Khan 
had gained access both to secret technical data concerning the 
plant's highly classified uranium enrichment process and to 
detailed lists of equipment used in the facility, all of which 
he transferred to Pakistan. 
  Even before Khan had left his post in the Netherlands in 
1975, Pakistani nuclear scientists were using the information he 
had provided to begin purchasing key components for a Pakistani 
ultracentrifuge pilot plant which was later built in the town of 
Sihala, southwest of Islamabad. 
  Later, under Khan's direction, Pakistan initiated 
construction of an industrial scale plant at nearby Kahuta with 
thousands of centrifuge units. The experts say later Pakistan 
was able to obtain as much as 100 metric tonnes of uranium 
concentrate popularly known as yellow cake not subject to 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitoring from Libya. 
The material had originally been purchased by Libya from Niger 
and then reexported to Pakistan. 
  They say Pakistan's first nuclear power plant, known as 
Karachi Nuclear Power Project, a 137 megawatt, natural 
uranium/heavy water reactor purchased from Canada, was completed 
in 1972. It was subjected to IAEA inspections and has capacity 
to produce nuclear weapon grade material. 
  After the 1971 Indo-Pak war, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the chief 
architect of Pakistan's nuclear programme, decided to develop 
atomic weapons. Since 1973, the country has been making efforts 
to acquire reprocessing and uranium enrichment technology both 
overtly and covertly and finally it was able to commission fuel 
fabrication plant at Chashma which is not subject to IAEA 
safeguard, the experts say. 
  The experts say this gave Pakistan a source of 
plutonium-bearing spent fuel from which the plutonium could be 
extracted for weapons in the New Labs reprocessing unit (Near 
Rawalpindi) or the Chashma reprocessing plant. 
  Pakistan's principal nuclear research centre is the 
Institute 
of Nuclear Science and Technology (PINSTECH). It has 
British-designed reprocessing laboratory with plutonium output 
and useful for training the country's technicians in this 
sensitive field. 
  They say information about Pakistan's uranium deposits is 
rather inconsistent and sometimes even contradictory. The 
country has claimed to have discovered uranium resources in 
Ghazi Khan Thalkot, Azad Kashmir and Cholistan, with an 
estimated total of several hundred tonnes. 
  The experts point out that in light of aid from a 
neighbouring country and Pakistan's years of weapons design 
work, a test may not be necessary for the country to have 
confidence that the nuclear arms will work. There are a number 
of other reasons which suggest that Pakistan will refrain from 
declaring that it possesses nuclear arms, the experts added.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Separate State Demanded by Hindus of </F>
Kashmir"] 
  [Text] Dr. Ajay Chrungoo, official spokesman of Panun 
Kashmir, which is organizing a two-day World Kashmiri Pandit 
Conference to be held at New Delhi on 27 and 28 December, today 
demanded a separate homeland for Kashmiri Hindus. He accused the 
government of ignoring the concerns of this minority community, 
which had been forced out of its home by Pakistan's activities. 
  In a press conference he said the government willingly 
talked 
with the all-party Hurriyat Conference, and with everyone else, 
while consciously failing to take note of that component, namely 
the Kashmiri Hindus, who were the actual victims of the ethnic 
cleansing in the valley. 
  The Panun Kashmir spokesman also assailed Amnesty 
International and Asia Watch, two human rights organizations, 
for highlighting human rights violations and ethnic cleansing in 
Bosnia and other places around the World, but not presenting the 
true picture of Kashmir. He said the two human rights 
organizations undermined certain basic features of Indian 
democracy by doing nothing to protect the human rights of the 
Kashmiri Pandits, who were the victims of the Islamic 
fundamentalist groups operating in the valley. Pakistan was 
pushing weapons and ideology into Kashmir for the destruction of 
peaceful coexistence and harmony, and India had failed to 
protect the constitutional rights of the Kashmiri Hindus, when 
they were forced out of their homes by infiltrators. He also 
said the human rights organizations were preoccupied with 
excesses committed by the state apparatus. The spokesman said: 
"Amnesty International and Asia Watch highlight only one aspect 
and ignore the other, and Amnesty representatives on a visit 
here some time ago would not give us an appointment to hear our 
case. Despite provocations, the community has not taken up arms 
and continues to plead for protection and understanding. We are 
seeing the extinction of a race that has been living in Kashmir 
for 5,000 years. Ours is a historical identity. Inspite of all 
of this, our families are fragmented, and nobody cares for us.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Israel Backs India's Stand on </F>
Kashmir Issue"] 
  [Text] Israel supported India's stand on Kashmir 
unambiguously today. This issue was discussed during a meeting 
of the Israeli Agriculture Minister, Yaakov Tsur, with the 
External Affairs Minster, Dinesh Singh. Yaakov is touring India. 
According to an official spokesman of the External Affairs 
Ministry, the Israeli minister emphasized that his country 
"fully and unambiguously" supported India's stand on the Kashmir 
issue. Dinesh Singh has said that India fully supported the West 
Asian peace process. He had expressed the hope that it would 
reach a successful conclusion. 
  The two leaders held wide-ranging discussions on matters 
pertaining to agricultural cooperation. The self-appointed 
leader of the JKLF [Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front], Amanulla 
Khan, has said in Brussels that Kashmir should be united by the 
efforts of India and Pakistan, so that a true plebiscite could 
be held in the future. 
  Khan was arrested on 18 October in Brussels. He was 
apprehended with an international warrant based on charges of 
many killings brought against him by India. 
  The Indian High Commission in Kuwait has raised vehement 
objections to accusations of human rights violations in Kashmir 
made at a conference of intellectuals and ulemas sponsored by 
the Pakistan High Commission there. According to the Kuwaiti 
daily ARAB TIMES, a former minister of Kuwait and some 
professors from the Kuwait University had participated in the 
conference. According to the newspaper's report, the 
intellectuals urged the Muslims all over the world to come 
together to relieve the Kashmiri Muslims of their plight. They 
had also said at the same time not to think of war as a possible 
solution. In the meanwhile, 10 people, including six militants, 
had been killed in the valley, while 45 were wounded in clashes. 
Police had foiled the efforts to loot a cash van and had 
arrested 10 extremists, and two more had surrendered on their 
own accord.

<F P=106> [By Bharat Bhushan in Washington] </F>
  [Text] The Kashmir issue seems set to further strain 
Indo-US ties with a letter sent by President Bill Clinton to the 
head of a pro-Pakistan, pro-militant organisation of Kashmiri 
Americans referring to human rights violations in Kashmir and 
offering to work with them "to bring peace to Kashmir." 
  The letter, written on December 27 to Ghulam Nabi Fai of the 
Kashmiri American Council (KAC), could not have come at a more 
inopportune time. It comes in the wake of Clinton's raising the 
Kashmir issue in the UN, the US flip-flop on the Instrument of 
Accession and the failure of the Indo-Pak talks. 
  (India reacted to the letter by hoping the US would not 
ignore gross human rights violations committed by terrorists in 
Kashmir, aided and abetted by Pakistan, while thinking of peace 
in the Valley. "We are committed to strengthening the 
institutions relevant to the upholding of human rights in 
India," an official said). 
  The Clinton letter seems to recognise Fai as an interlocutor 
in the Kashmir dispute. India would find this particularly 
objectionable as Fai's organisation is widely believed to be 
funded by Pakistan and is seen as promoting instability in 
Kashmir. 
  Fai has made a career out of lobbying against India in US 
Congress and that is what he gets paid for as KAC executive 
director. India can, therefore legitimately ask why a US 
President should write to him that he looks forward to working 
with him. 
  Fai speaks for people seen as terrorists by most Indians and 
this is bound to raise questions about where the US stands on 
terrorism when it does not threaten its own citizens directly. 
  All the State Department would say about the letter was that 
it was consistent with the US policy of being willing to assist 
India and Pakistan on Kashmir. The US -- an official said 
reiterating the Clinton Administration's stand -- does not see 
itself as a mediator unless it is requested for by both nations. 
Clinton's letter should be seen in that context, he said. 
  Before getting all hot and sweaty about the letter, it may 
be 
pertinent to take a few deep breaths and note that he does not 
even get to see the thousands of letters he receives and which 
are responded to with his name appended to them. 
  A lot of people write to Clinton just as any other head of 
state and a number of them receive responses. The response to 
Fai's letter is fairly innocuous at one level and in all 
likelihood drafted by some bleeding-heart liberal in White House 
who has no intention of striking one more blow to Indo-US 
relations. 
  But this is merely the mechanics of how the letter would 
have 
got written. When his name is appended to a letter those 
responsible for doing so have to be more sensitive about the 
contents. 
  After Clinton's infamous reference to Kashmir in the UN and 
the brouhaha following Assistant Secretary of State Robin 
Raphel's statement on the Instrument of Accession one would have 
thought the US Administration would be more careful. 
  In all fairness after the Raphel statement, the State 
Department took a reasonable public position. But the White 
House staff seems to work with its own agenda. And this letter 
is an example.

<F P=106> [Article: "Pact Signed With Israel To Cooperate In </F>
Agriculture"] 
  [Text] Israel and India signed an agreement today for 
cooperation in agricultural science and technology, including 
research, education, developmental projects, and joint ventures. 
  The Union Minister for agriculture, Mr. Balram Jakhar, and 
his Israeli counterpart, Mr. Yaakov Tsur, signed the areement, 
which will result in cooperation between companies or 
institutions of the two countries through collaborative 
activities and exchanges. 
  At a joint press conference following the signing, Mr. 
Jakhar 
and Mr. Tsur felt there was vast scope for increasing bilateral 
cooperation since the restoration of diplomatic relations 
between the two countries two years ago. 
  Mr. Tsur stressed on intense cooperation in the field of 
water and soil management, stating that his country has been 
recently facing a shortage of water, and Israel would welcome 
the help of Indian scientists in this field. Israel has been 
supplying water to the entire country through a 400 km pipeline 
connecting to a reservoir lake, and India could provide valuable 
know-how in this field. Israel will make optimal use of water 
through the drip/sprinkler system developed by Pune's Finnolamb 
Company, with whom an agreement has been signed. Mr. Jakhar said 
that Israel will get the system at the same price that the 
Indian farmers get. He said that there were other areas where 
Israel has agreed to help India in her developmental projects. 
It was remarkable how Israel had come up as a forerunner inspite 
of many serious impediments. 
  Commenting on the excellent work done by Indian scientists 
in 
agricultural research and development, Mr. Tsur said the two 
countries could cooperate intensively in the fields of plant and 
animal sciences, farm mechanization, and technology. 
  Mr. Jakhar called for jointly working for greater 
agricultural production, through development of hybrid seeds, 
fertilizers, greenhouse and energy-saving technologies and by 
developing a marketing infrastructure while making use of 
Israeli expertise in these areas.

  [Excerpts] Tehran, Jan 12 (AFP)--Gunmen fired several shots 
at the British embassy in the Iranian capital causing some 
damage but no injuries, an embassy spokesman said Wednesday [12 
January]. [passage omitted] 
  The attack first came to light earlier the same day with a 
report in the English-language Tehran Times newspaper which 
blamed it on Iran's main armed opposition group, the Mojahedin-e 
Khalq [MKO]. 
  The attack was a "premeditated plot to damage" Iran's 
prestige and undermine its "recent improved relations with 
European countries," it said. 
  The Mojahedin, in a statement sent to AFP in Nicosia, denied 
the charge as "absurd" and countered that the attack was the 
work of the Iranian government. 
  "With the deepening of the regime's economic and political 
crises, Khomeyni's heirs have found the only recourse in 
stepping up domestic suppression and terrorism," it said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Sunday's shooting comes amid on-going tension in relations 
because of the death sentence issued by Iran's late spiritual 
guide Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeyni against British writer Salman 
Rushdie.

  [Excerpt] Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani has stressed the continued 
support of the Islamic Republic of Iran for the oppressed people 
of Afghanistan. He said: The only way to salvage and 
reconstruct Afghanistan is to revive the spirit of selflessness 
and sacrifice, and to encourage the jehadi groups to unite 
around the axis of Islam. 
  Addressing the participants in today's session of the third 
assembly of poetry on Islamic revolution in Afghanistan, the 
president referred to 14 years of jehad and struggle by the 
Afghan people against the occupiers, and their eventual victory 
over one of the world's largest powers. He considered this 
victory as a glorious historical chapter and a glittering 
episode in the life of the people of Afghanistan. He said that 
this was the result of the nation's sacrifices, and the presence 
of the spirit of cooperation and unity among them. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed concern over the present 
situation in Afghanistan where increasingly more damage is being 
caused as a result of the spread of war and bloodshed in that 
country. He said: Given the Islamic homogeneity of the Afghan 
nation, and the presence of the ethos of faith and hard work 
among them, the present situation in that country has in effect 
marred the shining record of the Islamic struggles of the 
nation, and will no doubt leave negative and undesirable traits 
in the history of that country. 
  The president added: If the foundation for all action is 
built on the use of force and military might, then the process 
of bloodshed and destruction will intensify, and discord and 
hostility among different groups will spread. Afghanistan, 
however, cannot endure any more damage. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani then said that the spiritual power 
and 
influence of our late imam [Khomeyni], both before and after the 
Islamic revolution, had acted like a guiding light for the 
Muslim nation of Iran. The safeguarding of this guiding light, 
he added, is a role that is being fulfilled by the eminent 
leader [Khamene'i] at present. He said: The leaders of jehadi 
groups must consciously obey a single leader chosen from their 
midst. In this way they will be able to safeguard the 
achievements of the Islamic revolution of Afghanistan, and find 
the opportunity to repair the damage and reconstruct their 
country. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentary </F>
Group] 
  [Text] Diplomatic activities have started to end the recent 
battles in Afghanistan, particularly those in Kabul city. Our 
ambassador in Kabul met heads of some of the conflicting groups 
yesterday and expressed our country's readiness to mediate 
between the belligerent groups to end the conflict and establish 
peace and tranquility in Afghanistan. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran has repeatedly expressed its 
concern over any conflict in Afghanistan, whatever its reason, 
and supports a political solution. The Iranian nation and 
Government, acting according to their canonical duties, 
supported the just struggles by the mojahedin during the 14 
years of their jehad against the communists and extended 
financial and material assistance to it. During the same period, 
they also hosted 2 million Afghan refugees. 
  The Afghan mojahedin's victory in the war against blasphemy 
and atheism made the Iranian nation happy, since expectations 
then were that Islamic rule in Afghanistan would be established 
and the two Muslim neighboring countries, which share historic, 
religious, and cultural characteristics, could live in 
tranquility next to each other. Despite these expectations, 
bloody clashes among rival groups that once fought against the 
communists on one front, concerned the Iranian nation. So, the 
Iranian Government--as a friendly, neighboring, and Muslim 
country--considers it its duty to spare no effort to end the 
conflict in that country. 
  Islamic Iran has always wanted Afghanistan's unity and 
territorial integrity and, having adopted a policy of not 
interfering in others' domestic affairs, it considers 
cooperating and coordinating with friendly Muslim countries to 
overcome their problems to be among the principles of its 
foreign policy. 
  Afghanistan is facing state organizational problems, 
problems 
in economic reconstruction and in establishing social law and 
order, the problem of refugees, and fuel and food problems. The 
Islamic Republic of Iran has always expressed its readiness to 
help the Afghan nation to overcome any need it has. 
  Hopefully, cooperation by friendly, Muslim, and neighboring 
countries can help to end the clashes in Afghanistan and 
stability and tranquility can be returned to Afghanistan. But 
success in this calls for cooperation and coordination among the 
jehadi forces.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 12, IRNA -- An English daily Wednesday 
[12 January] editorialized on clashes in Afghanistan and said it 
is time for different factions to get together for the sake of 
Islam to save their country. 
  The daily KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL said Central Asian Republics 
were aspiring to follow the heroism of the Afghans against the 
"Russian bear" and through cooperation make the region into a 
strong bastion of resurgent Islam. 
  Unfortunately, it said, "the leaders in Afghanistan have 
turned out to be lesser beings with inflated ego, ready to 
infringe upon the rights of others and cut each other's throats 
at the behest of outside forces. 
  "To make outsiders happy they are even indifferent to the 
plight of the innocent peace-loving populace whose hopes and 
aspirations after the end of communist rule, were soon dashed by 
the much acclaimed victors of the unequal war," the article 
stressed. 
  However, commented the article, it is not too late to find a 
remedy to the blood-curdling bickerings for power, adding that 
the first thing the Afghan groups should realize is that 
national reconciliation and not un-Islamic rivalries for 
domination of the country is the need of the hour. 
  "Time and again Iran has shown its brotherly intentions of 
healing rift, and in the spirit of true Islamic brotherhood 
likes to see a strong and stable Afghanistan as its neighbor," 
the daily noted. 
  The paper concluded by saying it is now up to the warring 
factions to continue their "self-destructive dance" and feel 
accountable before God for the wanton devastation of a nation, 
or to regain their senses and strive in earnest in the interests 
of peace and prosperity.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Once Again a Power Struggle in Kabul!"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The power struggle in Kabul continues to take 
its toll with the conflicting factions resorting to all their 
military resources to annihilate or at least to defeat the other 
side. 
  The arms that were gathered once in the name of the Afghan 
jehad by its forces, plus the arsenals that were inherited from 
the Kabul regime, are now being used for an extensive massacre 
of rival jehadi groups. Those groups that were not so insistent 
on wasting their arms so inconsiderately during the 14 years of 
jehad as they are now are showing surprising generosity and are 
resorting to missile, artillery, and other deadly attacks 
against each other. 
  Actually, the canons, mortar, and missiles that they did not 
use during the 14 years of jehad are now being used without any 
limit to force the other jehadi forces to kneel. Under such 
conditions, it is the people in Kabul and in all of Afghanistan 
who are the main losers in the inauspicious war and in the 
regrettable confrontation. [passage omitted] 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran has expressed its regrets over 
the renewed fighting in Kabul and has called on the belligerent 
sides to end their clashes and to seek peaceful means to solve 
their problems. 
  The truth is that the jehadi forces have never been able to 
correctly understand the oppressed Afghan people's wish to begin 
the era of reconstruction under the banner of Islam and they 
have never acted appropriately on the heavy responsibility that 
they shoulder. All this has led to the Afghan people's 
disillusionment since none of the jehadi forces has been able to 
fulfill their pure wishes. 
  It was not, and is not, logical for the fruits of 14 years 
of 
the Afghan nation's struggles to be considered as "war booty" 
and for each group to want to gain as much of this booty as 
possible and to trample on the blood that was shed by 1.5 
million martyrs during these struggles. 
  It is bitter but true that some jehadi groups are showing 
the 
kind of determination to annihilate their rivals that they did 
not show during the jehad and are more hasty in taking revenge 
on their jehadi rivals than they were even at the climax of the 
jehad. The role played by the time-serving forces and those 
groups who shift their support to one group or another as 
conditions call for is perceptible today more than ever before. 
But the question is: When will Afghanistan be freed from such 
regrettable clashes? 
  There may not be a clear answer to this question. But 
everyone knows that the jehadi forces are willing to pay any 
price to annihilate or to defeat each other. Even if this war 
of attrition is temporarily stopped, it will still be like ember 
under ashes for a long time to come, and it is precisely because 
of this that it is in the interest of Afghanistan and of the 
oppressed Afghan people that the wise begin to act to bring the 
views of the jehadi forces closer and not to waste more time in 
extinguishing a flame that is destroying the entire Afghan 
nation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Engineer Ahmadi, director general of the </F>
Economic Department in Khorasan Governorate, by unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given: "A New Look at the 
Economic Relations Between Herat and Khorasan"] 
  [Text] The outlook on economic and commercial relations 
between Khorasan and Herat Provinces has become quite hopeful 
following the exchange of high-level provincial delegations 
during the past year. The subsequent meetings that resulted in 
the signing of cooperation protocols and, in some cases, of 
agreements indicate that these two contiguous provinces have 
frequent and close exchanges. It can be stated that economic 
and commercial moves have been initiated and are continuing but 
that these moves are not as dynamic as had been envisaged. 
  The reason for this slow pace is the political situation in 
Afghanistan, especially in its central government. The 
government has not been able to establish a security framework 
and is still grappling with acute political problems, which is 
why it is paying less attention to economic issues. 
  On the other hand, the political fervor is not the same all 
over Afghanistan. There is more stability in Herat Province 
than there is in the capital, which is why economic and 
commercial relations with Khorasan are at the present level and 
are expected to expand. 
  To become better acquainted with the current relations 
between Herat and Khorasan, our correspondent interviewed 
Engineer Ahmadi, the director general of the Economic Affairs 
Department of the Khorasan Governorate, and we draw our readers' 
attention to the detailed text of this interview: 
  [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] Could you please tell us about the 
economic protocols [preceding word in English] signed between 
the Provinces of Herat and Khorasan and to what extent they have 
been implemented? What results have been achieved so far? 
  [Ahmadi] I should say that the economic protocols were 
signed 
to activate commercial relations in the private sector and that 
the trading companies in these provinces have become active. 
This is borne out by the customs statistics, and the exchange 
of commodities is continuing. Some of these agreements are 
based on offering technical and engineering services, as well as 
technological training and research matters, such as 
reconstruction of industrial and agricultural installations, 
planning, revival of fields, and repair of water sources. Some 
work has been done on this matter. A report on this subject has 
been submitted to the relevant officials and the necessary 
allocations have been made. These plans will be implemented as 
soon as the other side expresses its willingness to provide 
funds and designate the necessary backing. Of course, some of 
the agreements regarding the provision of free development 
services, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides for plant diseases and 
seed-yielding plants have been implemented. 
  [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] What is the situation on the transit of 
goods between Herat and Khorasan Provinces? 
  [Ahmadi] The agreement on the transit of goods between the 
two countries expired last year and it took quite a while to 
extend it, but this was eventually done with the cooperation of 
Khorasan officials. Fortunately, it was approved in the Islamic 
Majles and the transit of goods continues between the two 
countries. The ingress and egress routes of these goods do not 
face any legal problems and traffic is continuing. 
  [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] There was mention of the establishment 
of joint border markets in the agreements between the provinces 
of Herat and Khorasan. Will this happen in the near future? 
  [Ahmadi] Yes. It was mentioned in the agreements that joint 
border markets would be set up on the border in Eslam-qal'eh and 
Do Gharun and an agreement was signed on this matter. We have 
repeatedly expressed our willingness on the subject but Herat 
officials have stated that their final concurrence depends on 
approval by Kabul officials, and no results have been announced 
so far. However, there is no problem on our side. As soon as 
the other side expresses its willingness, we will be ready to 
set up the border market. We have set up border stores in Do 
Gharun unilaterally, which are very active and sell items 
required by returning Afghan refugees at reasonable prices to 
expedite the return of the refugees and to cater to their needs. 
These stores are relatively prosperous. 
  [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] Do the economic agreements only 
include Herat Province or do they encompass the other parts of 
Afghanistan as well? 
  [Ahmadi] No. The agreements are not exclusively for Herat 
Province and Iranian traders are active in other parts of 
Afghanistan as well. Some of our transportation companies have 
succeeded in setting up offices in Herat and the exchange of 
goods with Herat, Heyratan, and Mazar-e Sharif continues. 
  [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] In the current conditions prevailing in 
Afghanistan, do you think that the necessary security exists 
regarding industrial and commercial investment? 
  [Ahmadi] Of course, the economic officials of the two 
countries have announced their readiness to implement some of 
the protocols, such as putting the installations in Herat into 
operation, or joint investment in industrial and agricultural 
projects. We are optimistic that conditions will soon be 
conducive to their implementation. Afghanistan is currently in 
a transitional state and is moving from one set of circumstances 
to another, while the government is seeking to consolidate its 
position. It has to compile a new set of regulations and needs 
coordination. 
  For this reason the implementation of new accords is being 
pursued with greater caution. As I stated earlier, since we 
opened our offices of representation our relations have 
flourished and, God willing, this will be a precursor to the 
implementation of agreements. It would be more expedient to act 
after reviewing the situation and the current circumstances. 
  [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] How far has the repair and renovation 
of highways progressed? 
  [Ahmadi] According to the latest reports from the 
governorate's technical office, the road has been paved and is 
ready for asphalting. [preceding word in English] A segment of 
it had been scheduled for asphalting but it was postponed, 
probably because of the onset of cold weather and the need for a 
survey by the contractors. 
  [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] It has been decided that Khorasan 
Province would hold an industrial and trade exhibition in Herat 
Province. Could you elaborate on that? 
  [Ahmadi] Regarding the forging of economic relations with 
neighboring countries, we consider the convening of trade and 
industrial exhibitions as the first step toward progress in this 
path, whether it is for the sale of goods or for the exchange of 
expertise. 
  It was for this purpose that Khorasan Province announced its 
readiness to set up an exhibition in Herat Province a year ago. 
As soon as the go-ahead is given, and the other side is ready, 
we will immediately hold the exhibition. 
  [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] Have any measures been taken on banking 
relations? 
  [Ahmadi] Some officials visited Herat to discuss the 
establishment of a branch of Saderat Bank and talks were held on 
the subject. We still await the other side's concurrence and we 
hope that a branch of the bank will be set up in Herat. 
  [EQTESAD-E KHORASAN] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 12, IRNA -- The Islamic Republic of 
Iran is ready to continue talks with the United Arab Emirates 
(UAE) and receive officials from that country, a Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said Wednesday [12 January]. 
  The spokesman, Mahmud Mohammadi, termed the statement issued 
by the recent Damascus meeting on the Iranian islands as 
repetition of the "baseless claims by the UAE over the islands". 
  Foreign minister of the (Persian) Gulf Cooperation Council, 
(P)GCC, and their counterparts from Egypt and Syria concluded a 
two-day meeting in Damascus, Syria, on January 10 without 
reaching any result. 
  "We pay attention to that part of the statement of the 
Damascus meeting which mentions friendly neighborhood and 
elimination of disputes through peaceful talks and declare our 
readiness to continue talks and receive officials from the UAE," 
said Mohammadi. 
  "However," he added, "it is the UAE which has not responded 
positively to Iran's readiness to continue bilateral talks." 
He deplored that the UAE Government on the one hand emphasizes 
on mutual talks to settle misunderstandings between the two 
countries but on the other hand does not take any practical step 
in this connection. 
  It should be noted that Iran has repeatedly welcomed the 
visit to Tehran of the UAE officials to hold talk on the 
settlement of misunderstandings between the two countries 
without any prejudgements. 
  However, the UAE officials have not yet responded to the 
good-will shown by Iran which is of importance for the 
strengthening of the friendly neighborhood and stability in the 
region.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Zionists Are Digging Their Own Grave!"] </F>
  [Text] Israel has made new decisions on confronting the 
Islamic forces in Gaza and Jericho and intends to arm 'Arafat's 
forces so that they can carry out their mission of crushing the 
intifadah and annihilating Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
as best as possible. 
  Parallel to this decision, the Zionist regime has taken the 
unexpected step of calling on European countries to help 
'Arafat's faction and the compromising PLO faction in crushing 
the intifadah. Irrespective of all the objectives that Israel 
expects this new plan to achieve, all facts show that the 
situation in the occupied territories, especially in Gaza and 
Jericho, are detrimental to both 'Arafat and Israel. 
  Under such conditions, arming 'Arafat's mercenaries to crush 
the intifadah and Hamas is the biggest mistake that the enemy 
has made. The Islamic forces will have more golden opportunities 
to more easily acquire the arms that they need for their 
anti-occupational operations. 
  The truth is that the Zionists have lost control of the 
situation in occupied Palestine, and with their current action 
they show how disappointed they are with their past efforts and 
are even prepared to arm people who can easily change stances 
and act against the Zionists. Even though having arms in the 
occupied territories under the current conditions can solve many 
of the Palestinians' complicated problems in their confrontation 
with the occupying enemy, nevertheless the more major issue that 
reveals the vulnerability of Israel and 'Arafat's compromising 
faction is that even among his ranks there are many who are 
dissatisfied with the situation and do not endorse the 
continuous treacheries of 'Arafat and the other compromising 
leaders of the PLO. Naturally, these people are waiting for 
suitable opportunities to be able to avenge themselves and the 
Palestinian people on occupying Israel. 
  It is precisely because of this that, despite 'Arafat's 
treason and the concordance between some of the compromising 
heads of the PLO and the Zionists, not a great deal has changed 
in Israel's favor and developments in the occupied territories 
leave much to be desired for the occupiers. 
  The Zionists are digging their own graves today and this 
golden opportunity for the Palestinians to acquire arms can 
herald a more bitter tomorrow for the occupiers. 
  This disgraceful game between Israel and 'Arafat is so 
idiotic that it has been defeated and has disgraced the enemies 
of Islam in dear Palestine even in its initial stage. Who 
knows? Maybe it is written that the Zionists will be killed by 
bullets that are fired from their own guns!

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 12, IRNA -- Two morning 
Persian-language dailies here Wednesday [12 January] 
editorialized on the recent 6 + 2 meeting in Damascus with one 
interpreting Syria's participation as a blow to its political 
dignity and the other stressing that regional security can be 
safeguarded only by the Persian Gulf littoral states. 
  Commenting on the failure of the meeting, held early this 
week, to achieve a result, the daily `ABRAR' said that the 
Syrians accepted to attend the 6 + 2 due to their expanded 
disputes with Baghdad regime. 
  The paper draw the attention of the Syrian statemen to the 
fact that since the U.S. looks at 6 + 2 as a `club' for those 
favoring the compromise trend in the Middle East, Syria's 
particiaption in such a group might be interpreted as a blow to 
the political dignity of an independent progressive country. 
  If the U.S. will be able to join Damascus to Tel Aviv there 
would be no problem, otherwise, said the paper in conlusion, 
Syria would have no place among the other seven countries. 
  Commenting on the same subject `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' referred 
to the role that Egypt played in the meeting and said Cairo did 
not waste any attempt to sow seeds of suspicion over the future 
of Iran's cooperation with regional countries. 
  "It has always tried to frustrate any proper effort for 
regional cooperation by creating a state of pessimism and 
concern among the regional states." 
  As far as Iran is concerned, added the daily, the Islamic 
republic has never interfered in internal affairs or 
decision-making of its arab or other neighboring countries and 
would never do so in future. 
  However, the article noted, Cairo was looking for its own 
interests in the "troubled waters of the Persian Gulf" and in 
creating tension in Iran's relations with the Persian Gulf 
Cooperation Council (P)GCC. 
  The article pointed to the fact that Egypt, due to its 
severe 
security crisis and lack of public support, was not able to help 
the (P)GCC to maintain regional security and stability. 
  Time has proven that regional security should be only 
maintained by the region's littoral states and any attempt to 
neglect such a concrete reality would only ruin "golden 
opportunities" for preserving regional security and might, it 
concluded.

  [Text] United Nations, New York, Jan. 12, IRNA -- Twenty 
four civilians and military personnel were killed, four wounded 
and four kidnapped during attacks by counterrevolutionary groups 
on Iranian forces in southern and western border regions of the 
country from 1 to 8 September. 
  In a letter to the U.N. Secretary General, Butrus

of Iranian forces, kidnapping civilian residents, entering 
villages and threatening residents to avoid cooperation with 
Iranian forces, planting mines were among other cases of 
cease-fire violation. 
  The letter mentioned attacks on a group of Iranian forces by 
anti-revolutionaries who penetrated into Iranian territory on 
September 23 as a result of which eight troopers were killed and 
six others wounded. 
  Anti-revolutionary groups also attacked a vehicle belonging 
to the Geographical Institute in Bariso district on September 6

killed and two soldiers accompanying him were abducted in 
Kanishaikh region. 
  Another soldier who was on guard duty at the Chilat 
observatory post was abducted, roads were barricaded in the 
general region of Banneh and two local residents were arrested 
and taken to Iraq by anti-revolutionary groups, it said. 
  In eleven cases, anti-revolutionary groups fled to Iraq 
after 
being identified and encountered by Iranian forces. 
  Six anti-revolutionary people who had penetrated into Iran 
in 
the Ghale-Rash region, south of Sardasht, to plant mines in the 
area fled to Iraq after facing civilian residents.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Behind the Curtain of Massacre in Iraqi </F>
Kurdistan"] 
  [Text] The wretched hands of America, Turkey, and France 
are clearly visible in the savage massacre that is taking place 
against the Muslim Kurds in Iraq. 
  The wave of massacre of Kurdish Muslims adopts its true 
meaning when viewed precisely within the framework of plots by 
arrogance which are aimed at the dismemberment of Iraq and at 
creating a reliable base for the West's forces in northern Iraq. 
  The issue took on a serious nature with the creation of a 
"safe haven" in Iraq. And it was within the framework of this 
plan that American and French forces, using Turkish support 
facilities, tried to dismember Iraqi Kurdistan. The formation 
of a parliament followed by the establishment of an independent 
government constituted the next phase in the series of more 
serious steps by arrogance to create a "second Israel" in the 
region. And now the Western countries and especially America 
feel that the Muslim Kurdish forces are obstructing their 
objectives and that their plans to fully dismember Kurdistan may 
be foiled. 
  It is precisely because of this that during its recent talks 
with Jalal Talabani, Washington made the continuation of 
military, economic, and security assistances as well as 
propaganda support for Talabani contingent on getting rid of 
Islamic Kurdish movements and explicitly called for the 
uprooting of Islamic groups from northern Iraq. 
  Turkey too has displayed a nauseating stance on this issue. 
On the one hand, the Ankara government feels that fanning the 
flames of secessionist movements in northern Iraq also affects 
Turkey's national security and has explicitly expressed its 
concern over joint U.S.-French plans in northern Iraq which 
specifically come within the framework of creating a safe haven 
in Iraqi Kurdistan and, on the other, it is tempted to gain 
access to Kirkuk's oil resources and to play the role of the 
West's gendarme in northern Iraq. 
  Public opinion in Iraqi Kurdistan finds it difficult to 
understand why the Ankara government has started the most savage 
massacre and suppression of the Kurds in Turkey while at the 
same time it is being so generous in strengthening the Kurds in 
Iraqi Kurdistan. Moreover, the officials of the Ankara 
government have repeatedly used the Iraqi Kurdish leaders to 
achieve their goals, even during the suppression of the Kurds in 
Turkey. Turkey even granted Talabani a "Turkish diplomatic 
passport" and included him in a Turkish delegation that visited 
Washington for talks. 
  Even if the Ankara government considers all these things to 
belong to the past and claims that it has reviewed its past 
policies, nevertheless the issue is that today operations by 
America, France, and Britain in Iraqi Kurdistan within the 
framework of Hammer Force are carried out with the help of 
Turkish support units, specifically at Incirlik base. 
  It is now very obvious that from its very outset, the Hammer 
Force never intended to establish stability and balance in the 
region; that it has always tried to throw the region off 
balance, to create instability, and to establish a "second 
Israel" in the region; and that it has gradually implemented 
plans that have harmed and will continue to harm Turkey too. 
  In addition, let us not forget that it has never been 
possible to establish equilibrium and stability in this 
sensitive area with a "hammer" and that experience has shown 
that any abuse of power--and in such a nauseating manner, at 
that--has only led and will lead to a vicious cycle of 
uncontrollable events in the entire region. 
  The major point here is that once again, the Iraqi Kurds 
have 
been fooled by America and its other allies; and it is highly 
possible that this time too they will only realize the depth of 
the tragedy when it is too late and when even those who consider 
themselves in control of the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan will 
have lost control. 
  Whatever the objectives, methods, and outcome of this 
disgraceful game, the view of the Islamic Republic of Iran of 
the incidents in Iraqi Kurdistan, which have been repeatedly 
pointed out by the officials of the system, can be summed up as 
follows: 
  1. The people of Iraqi Kurdistan, like the rest of the Iraqi 
people, have suffered from tragedies throughout the past few 
decades, and the solution of their problems cannot be separated 
from or placed outside the framework of a radical solution to 
the problems of Iraq. 
  2. Any type of solution to the problem of Iraqi Kurdistan 
should be sought within the framework of safeguarding the 
independence, territorial integrity, and sovereignty of Iraq; 
and naturally any type of secessionist movement, even under the 
pretext of saving the Iraqi people from Baghdad's pressures, is 
unjustifiable. 
  3. Any decision, movement, or step for solving the problem 
of the Iraqi people should come from the Iraqi people themselves 
and should certainly not involve political or military 
interventions by foreigners. If not, foreigners will get an 
opportunity to infiltrate the area. Today we see how the Muslim 
Kurds of Iraq are getting a bloodbath from other groups of Iraqi 
Kurds and how, within the framework of dismembering Iraqi 
Kurdistan, once again more people are being expelled from their 
homes and are facing "forced deportation"; and if they refuse, 
they have no guarantees that they will stay alive. 
  All these problems and incidents once again testify to the 
just, correct, and strong stances of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran vis-a-vis the problems of Iraq--both as far as the Shiites 
in the South, the Kurds in the North, and people any other place 
in this oppressed land are concerned--and it proves that America 
and its allies are pursuing wretched objectives in the region 
and only want to exploit the Kurds and others for their own 
motives.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Excerpts] Rivalry among Western countries to maintain 
their share of the Saudi arms market has intensified as Saudi 
Arabian budget shrinks. 
  The French prime minister, who has been in Saudi Arabia for 
the past few days at the head of a military-economic team, 
hopes, by offering easy payments terms and bilateral oil deals 
in future, to encourage the authorities in Riyadh to sign three 
trading and military agreements with France. [passage omitted] 
  Yet, the Saudi defense minister has so far told the French 
that their easy terms were not sufficient and that his country, 
because of the falling oil prices, had to think long before 
signing any new agreement. 
  Meanwhile, the British defense minister, who is currently in 
Saudi Arabia, is trying to clarify the outcome of the agreement 
for the sale of 48 Tornado planes signed two years ago. [passage 
omitted] 
  The British officials fear that because of its shrinking 
budget, which mainly affects military expenditures, Saudi Arabia 
may cancel its military contracts and in return the British 
military industries may face a serious crisis. 
  Political pundits believe that though the fall in oil prices 
can help Western countries out of their economic recession, it 
may, as a by-product, confront the Western military industries 
with a crisis. [passage omitted] 
  So long as the West uses various levers to keep oil prices 
at 
a low level, oil producing countries will be forced to slow down 
their purchases from the international market. Such a 
consequence is a major tragedy for the Western arms industries. 
  Thus, the fall in oil prices is a two-edged sword in the 
hands of the Western countries; they will have to clarify their 
position with regard to that sword.

<F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F>
Group] 
  [Text] There is a strong possibility that OPEC and non-OPEC 
countries will reduce oil production. The petroleum ministers 
of the six Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] countries will 
meet in Bahrain next week to study the outcome of efforts by the 
Omani petroleum minister. He is contacting non-OPEC members in 
a bid to urge them to reduce production. 
  Oil sources have described the Omani minister's contacts as 
important. Oman is among the non-OPEC members that have 
accepted reducing production by five percent. Following the 
drop in oil prices and after meeting the Qatari energy minister, 
who is also the OPEC secretary general, the Omani petroleum 
minister left on a series of visits to Yemen, Egypt, Syria, 
Norway, Britain, and Russia--all non-OPEC countries--and gained 
their agreement, Norway and Britain excepted, to reduce 
production. 
  After the recent GCC summit and the statement of readiness 
by 
the GCC heads to reduce oil production, the issue of agreement 
between OPEC and non-OPEC members has become more serious. Iran 
has said it is ready to reduce oil production, stressing that a 
decision to reduce production can be made within the OPEC 
framework. 
  Many oil experts believe that in addition to the economic 
recession in the West and the West's oil policies, the drop in 
oil prices is also linked with increased production by non-OPEC 
members. This has led to efforts to convince these countries to 
reduce production in a coordinated manner. The Omani petroleum 
minister will continue his mission with visits to Brunei, 
Malaysia, and Mexico within the next few days. 
  The reduction in oil prices has already affected the budgets 
of the Persian Gulf Arab countries and made Saudi Arabia, which 
is the largest oil producer, review its military projects and 
its astronomic arms purchases. The reduction in the budgets and 
the scrapping of ambitious military plans by the Persian Gulf 
countries means a drop in foreign purchases, placing economic 
pressure on the West's industries and military and nonmilitary 
finances. So, the Western countries will gradually pay for the 
damages that their policies on the oil-producing countries have 
caused. 
  KUNA reported that the Kuwaiti petroleum minister will 
discuss oil developments and ways to control oil prices at the 
meeting of the GCC foreign [as heard] ministers in Bahrain. 
This shows that in addition to its impact on the economy of the 
Arab oil-producing countries, the reduction in oil prices may 
have domestic political consequences for them if left 
uncontrolled.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 11, IRNA -- Secretary General of the 
International Chamber of Commerce Jean Charles Rouher said here 
Tuesday [11 January] that Iran would do better to join the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if it wanted to 
have a wide scale on international markets. 
  He said there are no obstacles on Iran's membership in GATT. 
  The secretary general of the International Chamber of 
Commerce commented that voluntary exclusion from GATT does not 
imply any weakness on the part of any country. 
  Rouher said in his talks with the Iranian officials in 
Tehran 
he had been assured that the Islamic Republic is committed to 
continuing its national development projects that it started 
four years ago, as well as play a more active role in 
international circles. 
  In the same interview the Iranian secretary general of the 
(Iranian) committee of the International Chamber of Commerce 
Mohammad Mahdi Behkish said the Islamic Republic cannot do 
better than join GATT. He added that membership in GATT would 
benefit Iran and, among others, promote Iran's agricultural 
exports. 
  The International Chamber of Commerce has 117 member states 
and is active in 132 countries. It has 16 committees in various 
areas including tariffs, banking, insurance, tourism, and 
transportation. 
  Rouher is to leave Tehran later Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Year 1994 and Clinton's Dreams"] </F>
  [Text] The United States had a very difficult year in 1993, 
according to many. Most of the observers are unanimous on two 
points: 
  --The United States is planning for the future and the 
current uncoordinated policies are part of that planning. 
  --The Democrats as well as the people of the United States 
have made a mistake in electing Clinton as their President. 
  In any case, in 1993 the United States passed through a 
period in which it experienced problems inherited from the 
Republicans, including the events in Somalia and the ambivalence 
toward Russia. 
  However, in the Middle East the United States was successful 
in implementing a compromise more controversial and more 
treasonous than the Camp David accord. When 'Arafat--stripped 
of his gunbelt--shook hands with Rabin on the White House 
grounds, there were many who banged their heads against the wall 
in sheer fury. Some were not even Palestinians but had realized 
that the days of the Cold War had actually come to an end and 
most of the terms of that era had lost their true meaning. 
  In the early days of 1994, the U.S. President will have two 
very important meetings: with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in 
Geneva and with Russian President Yeltsin in Moscow. The Geneva 
meeting is of vital importance to the United States. If Hafiz 
al-Asad joins the trend of compromise, the Gaza-Jericho accord 
will be insured. In addition, if Israel makes peace with Syria, 
it will be able to enter the Middle East markets and the 
longstanding dream of the Zionists will materialize. 
  However, if Hafiz al-Asad insists on his former stance, the 
Gaza-Jericho accord will meet with the same fate as the Camp 
David accord. It will become the unsuccessful and isolated plan 
of an individual named 'Arafat who has neither legitimacy nor 
popularity. 
  Clinton will also have to empathize with Yeltsin and at the 
same time beware of someone such as Zhirinovskiy as the trend of 
events in Russia seems to be uncontrollable and unpredictable. 
The Russians need billions of dollars of assistance and the 
United States cannot hope to have such capital returned, 
especially since it does not know what to do about the vacuum 
created by the disbanding of the Warsaw pact in Eastern Europe. 
  Thus, it appears that the United States has difficult days 
ahead in 1994, especially since a united Europe is economically 
stronger than the United States. Even though it is not endowed 
with the U.S. political strength, it has very strong industries 
and considers rivalry in trade and commerce of greater 
importance than politics. The United States is aware that if it 
is hesitant in its approach toward countries such as the PRC and 
if it takes political considerations into account in its 
bilateral relations, Europe will immediately sign numerous 
agreements and will conquer the markets. 
  All these circumstances are not completely subservient to 
the 
wishes, needs, and capabilities of the Democrat administration 
in the United States, as Washington's cohorts and competitors 
have gauged the conditions prevailing in the world and have 
unconditionally demanded their rights. Therefore, Clinton will 
not be able to see all his dreams come true in 1994.

gradually to 15,000 barrels per day. The construction and 
installation of the oil tank has cost around 5.3 billion rials. 
The total area of this oil field is 54 square km, and is 
situated 35 km north of Andimeshk, between the Kabud and 
Lab-Sefid oil fields. 
  According to an IRNA report, the Qal'eh-Nar oil field holds

  [Text] Pakistan is not asking India to hand over Kashmir to 
anybody, but demands that the people of Kashmir be given the 
right to decide about their future. Commenting on the Indian 
foreign secretary's interview with Zee TV, the Foreign Office 
spokesman said in Islamabad today that India has kept the 
Kashmiris under bondage. Pakistan is asking India to free the 
Kashmiris, enabling them to decide about their fate, the 
spokesman said. The Indian foreign secretary, in his interview, 
had said India could never think of handing over Kashmir to 
Pakistan for the sake of peace. The Foreign Office spokesman 
said India was the first to take the Kashmir issue to the United 
Nations and had made an unequivocal commitment before the world 
body to hold fair and free plebiscite in occupied Kashmir in 
order to ascertain the will of the people, but, the spokesman 
added, India is now finding excuses to wriggle out of its clear 
pledges in the shape of UN resolutions.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Sardar Asif's Timely Warning"] </F>
  [Text] The South Asian region continues to be haunted by 
danger and difficulties, as there is no sign of a resolution to 
the main dispute between Pakistan and India, the Kashmir issue. 
A new round of bilateral talks was recently held after a lapse 
of more than a year. The talks failed, however, due to India's 
refusal to budge even an inch from its earlier position. Some 
U.S. Government spokesmen, especially Joseph P. Hoar, commander 
in chief of the Central Command, are giving the impression that 
the talks did not fail and that there has been considerable 
progress. However, a review of the statements of Pakistani and 
Indian spokesmen would hardly convince a person to share U.S. 
optimism. The general impression is that the 2-3 January talks 
remained abortive. This means the black cloud of tension is 
still hovering over the Indian subcontinent. 
  Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali rightly 
told 
his hosts in Tashkent that the Indian subcontinent and South 
Asia are facing great danger. He is also correct in saying that 
if the Kashmir dispute is not settled in accordance with the 
principles of justice and the UN resolutions, then war might 
erupt again between the two countries. If this happens -- God 
forbid -- the war might become nuclear. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali's 
statement could never be called an exaggeration. Observers of 
history and relations between the two countries know they have 
already fought three wars; Kashmir was the main dispute in all 
of them. Since the last war in 1971, the two countries have 
achieved nuclear capability. India openly carried out a nuclear 
explosion. Pakistan has not carried out such an explosion, but 
it acknowledges that it has the ability to make a nuclear weapon. 
  It is true that Pakistan has not manufactured a nuclear 
weapon, nor does it intend to do so. But if war erupts and it 
finds out that its opponent has a nuclear weapon, then Pakistan 
might take any step to defend itself. We know that on more than 
one occasion the two countries have come to the brink of war 
because of Indian military exercises; in these cases some 
foreign circles saw a real danger of nuclear war. Given the 
situation, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali's expression of apprehension 
about a nuclear war cannot be called an exaggeration or an 
unfounded product of imagination. 
  There is a real risk of nuclear war that not only threatens 
peace in South Asia, but in the whole world. The only way to 
avoid such a danger is to strike at the root cause of tension 
between the two countries, the well-known Kashmir dispute. The 
world powers, especially the United States, should put all their 
weight behind resolving the Kashmir issue if they want to save 
the Indian subcontinent from devastation and nuclear war. The 
danger signal given by Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali is not without its 
causes. He has informed the world in a timely manner of a 
possible danger; prudence dictates that serious efforts be made 
to deal with the situation before we miss the chance. It is not 
inappropriate to hope that the United Nations, the United 
States, the European countries, the Islamic Conference 
Organization, the PRC, and other Asian countries realize their 
responsibility in maintaining peace in this area and make 
wholehearted efforts to convince India to see reason. Pakistan 
has repeatedly conveyed its readiness to accept and implement 
any fair and reasonable proposal on Kashmir. Now it is up to 
India to realize its responsibilities and make sincere efforts 
to implement them. It will benefit the subcontinent and the two 
countries as well.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Reaction to the Atrocities Against Muslims"] </F>
  [Text] Warren [Zimmermann], director of refugee programs in 
the U.S. State Department, has resigned in protest over U.S. 
policy in Bosnia. In his letter to U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, he said the United States is not ready to do 
anything more to stop the bloodshed in Bosnia; hence, he is 
resigning his post. 
  In Bosnia, Serbian and Croat forces are committing brutal 
atrocities against the innocent Muslims there. Muslims are 
rapidly being deprived of all the basic necessities, and Bosnia 
is not allowed to buy arms from any country. The situation has 
reached such an extent that even some UN observers and soldiers 
have committed excesses against Muslim women in Bosnia. Serbian 
and Croat forces are being provided with arms by Yugoslavia and 
other Western countries. In Bosnia, Russian soldiers are 
fighting along with the Serbs. 
  But the doors to all sorts of assistance have been closed to 
Bosnian Muslims. When Iran tried to supply the Bosnian Muslims 
with arms, the Egyptian authorities seized them at the Suez 
Canal. Of course, during Nawaz Sharif's tenure, Pakistan 
provided Bosnia with 250 million rupees in assistance and a 
large loan. Recently, during his visit to Bosnia, Mohammad 
Nawaz Sharif set up an aid fund worth 20 million rupees. 
According to the Bosnian president, if the 150,000 Muslim 
soldiers had arms, they could turn the tide of the war within a 
few days. The United States and other Western countries are a 
major obstacle to this; they are not ready to tolerate the 
existence of a Muslim state in Europe. The Western countries 
that champion the cause of human rights and human values keep 
silent about the repeated Serb violations of cease-fire accords. 
  It is a dismal fact that even the Muslim countries, except 
for Pakistan and Iran, have not raised an effective voice in 
support of Bosnia. Recently, mass Muslim graves have been 
discovered in Croatia. The Muslim world's silence regarding 
these atrocities is tantamount to insensitivity of the first 
order. If the Muslim countries were to unite and exert pressure 
on the United Nations, and if there was a shift in the policy of 
the United States and other Western countries, the Bosnian 
Muslims could be saved from the Serb atrocities, and have their 
freedom protected as well.

  [Text] The LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] is 
reported to be holding prisoner 1,500 of its cadres who had 
rebelled against terrorist leader Prabhakaran. Official sources 
told LANKAPUVATH that these prisoners were being held under 
tight security, which have been described as hell holes. They 
are equipped with torture chambers. Intelligence reports say 
that among the other prisoners were terrorists who tried to 
desert the LTTE and others, like Mahattaya and Yogi, who have 
criticized the LTTE leadership for its intransigence in refusing 
to lay down arms and seek peace with the Sri Lankan Government. 
  Meanwhile, eight LTTE terrorists were reported killed by a 
Sri Lankan Navy patrol craft on the high seas in the eastern 
coast of Jaffna at a point between Point Pedro and Vettilaikerny 
on Saturday [8 January]. A military spokesman said that the 
LTTE had confirmed in a radio transmission that three of its 
boats were sunk and eight terrorists killed in the encounter.

  [Text] A feeling of disenchantment has come over the 
people of Jaffna following the LTTE's [Liberation Tigers of 
Tamil Eelam's] announcement last week of the passing of the 
death sentence of Gopalaswamy Mahendraraja alias Mahattaya and 
his supporters. 
  While about 120 close supporters of the former LTTE deputy 
leader were also taken into custody along with him, the Tiger 
leader Prabhakaran is also reported to have withheld the powers 
of several others including (Tompranga Yogi), (Baby 
Subranaigam), as well as, Anton Balasingham. Balasingham's 
Australian-born wife (Adel), however, is said to be unaffected. 
One-time second in command of the LTTE, Mahattaya was taken 
into custody by the loyalists of the Tiger leader Prabhakaran 
following the death of Sadasivam Krishnakumar, alias Kittu, in 
January last year. The death of Kittu occurred in an explosion 
on board an arms smuggling vessel intercepted by the Indian 
Navy. It was blamed on Mahattaya. 
  According to reports from the North, a section of the 
people, 
especially of the fishing village of Valvedditturai where both 
Mahattaya and Prabhakaran were born, believe that Tiger leader 
Prabhakaran was wrong in sentencing Mahattaya for treason. Many 
hail Mahattaya as a great leader who held the LTTE together at 
the time when Prabhakaran was in hiding in India.

<F P=106> ["Defense Report" by R. Selva Raja] </F>
  [Text] The armed forces have been alerted following secret 
reports received by the Military Intelligence Unit stating that 
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam [LTTE] are preparing to 
attack the Karainagar naval base and the Oorkavalturai and 
Mandaitivu Army camps. In its report, the Military Intelligence 
Unit has stated that after the destruction of the 
Nagathevanturai naval base, the next LTTE target will be the 
Karainagar base. The Tigers took six high-speed boats called 
water jets from the Nagathevanturai base. They also have two 
more boats of this type. Defense authorities are anticipating 
an attack on the Karainagar and Kankesanturai units. Navy gun 
boats and ships have been kept in readiness in Paruthiturai and 
Kankesanturai territorial waters to repel an LTTE attack. 
  Some night infiltration by extremists was detected on 
Oorkavalturai island. Recently two extremists were shot dead 
for landing on the island. Therefore, the armed forces are kept 
in combat readiness on the islands, which are under the control 
of the Army. Meanwhile, new Army commander Major General Gerry 
De Silva is going to take command on 1 January. Defense experts 
predict that during De Silva's tenure, there may be major 
changes in the Army. Tamil political circles say that one has 
to wait and see whether he will adopt the policy of 
confrontation followed by outgoing Lieutenant General Cecil 
Waidyaratne, or encourage negotiations. 
  Meanwhile, local elections are going to be held in the 
Eastern Province and Vavuniya. Nomination papers have been 
invited for this purpose. It is a different matter that the 
announcement for the elections has triggered strong protests 
among the Tamil parties. Reports from Jaffna say that President 
Wijetunge's announcement to launch an `operation' [preceding 
word in English] in the north after these elections has created 
a major stir in the LTTE circles. The president's announcement 
indicates that a major offensive will be launched against the 
LTTE. In Jaffna, the Tigers have announced that the speeches 
made at last week's United National Party Conference indicate 
that according to the president's plan, a major offensive 
against the LTTE in Jaffna is planned for February. They have 
also announced that they are not ready for any talks, their 
doors are closed for negotiation, and they are also prepared for 
the war. 
  The Tigers adopted the path of confrontation after former 
President J.R. Jayewardene announced that the government was 
prepared for either war or peace. Jayewardene's announcement 
followed the death of 13 soldiers in the landmine blasts at 
Tirunelveli in Jaffna in 1983. Thousands of soldiers were 
killed within 10 years and tens of thousands of people became 
refugees. Saying that today's problem is only terrorism and not 
ethnic strife, the present president has announced that he is 
going to give surgical treatment [chathira chikichai] to the 
north. Tamil political leaders say that in the future, 
everyone will understand the connotations of the announcement. 
  Meanwhile, the government is seriously thinking about 
declaring the northern area to be a war zone. It is learned 
from highly reliable sources that Wijetunge has asked the three 
armed forces chiefs to be ready for a major conflict in February 
and to devise a strategy for his consideration before the 4 
February holiday. It is certain that a major offensive will be 
undertaken in the north after the next independence day. 
Reports from Jaffna suggest that the Tigers are getting ready 
for a major conflict after their offensive in Pooneryn. The 
Tigers have constituted hundreds of suicide squads to counter 
the war to be undertaken by the government in the north. 
Reports say that the Tigers are planning to deploy many more 
suicide squads than they deployed against the Army's Yaldevi 
operation and for their Frog Leap operation launched to overrun 
the Pooneryn and Nagathevanturai army and naval bases. 
  In any case, after the local elections in Eastern Province 
and Vavuniya, a major military offensive is certain in the 
north. The security force officers in Eastern Province and 
Vavuniya have already been directed to see that the Tigers do 
not infiltrate the areas where polling will take place during 
the elections. In the new year, the election process will be 
set in motion, but the leader of a popular Tamil political party 
has announced in Colombo that no political party with any 
self-respect will take part in the elections. Whatever is the 
case, there will no surprise even if the new year is declared as 
a year of war.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the negotiations on implementing the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, in Taba, by 
Ramadan Husayn, in Cairo, carried on the "Dialogue from Afar" 
program on 12 January--recorded] 
  [Text] [Husayn] Welcome to the Voice of the Arabs. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you. 
  [Husayn] Dr. Nabil, could you please brief us on the results 
of the meetings of the past two days? 
  [Sha'th] The talks seek to reach a written, signed agreement 
so that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho can begin 
as soon as possible. We have returned to Taba following a 
hiatus in the talks during which the Palestinian-Israeli Liaison 
Committee dealt with complicated issues including control over 
the border crossings and specifying the size of the Jericho area 
and the security zones that will surround the Israeli 
settlements in Gaza. We are still discussing these issues, 
among many others. We have a committee discussing the transfer 
of civilian powers to the Palestinian national authority in Gaza 
and Jericho. This committee has been successful and has already 
decided on the transfer of most departments. The Security 
Committee has been discussing the border crossings, Jericho, and 
other security issues. A third committee will formulate the 
general agreement that will also deal with the Palestinian 
national authority's powers. 
  [Husayn] Dr. Nabil, in what spheres have you made progress? 
What spheres remain pending? 
  [Sha'th] Progress has been made in the transfer of civilian 
powers. Discussions within the Security Committee are very slow 
and difficult. This is really the consequence of the Israeli 
attitude to these issues, especially as they are raising the 
stakes, insisting that the discussions will last long, and that 
they will not observe the 13 April date for completing 
withdrawal. Their public statements that they will not observe 
the agreement hinder progress on the security issue, the biggest 
problem in the negotiations. 
  [Husayn] Have you proposed a compromise on control over the 
border crossings? 
  [Sha'th] Each side is making proposals. But I believe we 
need to negotiate much more before we can announce real progress 
on this issue. 
  [Husayn] Dr. Nabil, after reports from Taba said that 
agreement had been reached specifying the size of the Jericho 
area as 55 sq km, you denied this and said the reports were 
fabricated. What are the facts? 
  [Sha'th] The reports were fabricated. The Israeli spokesman 
said the same when he was asked. The head of the Israeli 
delegation Major General Shahaq also stated that they were 
fabricated reports. 
  [Husayn] Have you reached a solution on specifying the size 
of the Jericho area? 
  [Sha'th] We are still working on it. Brother, these are the 
difficult points. They need much effort. 
  [Husayn] Dr. Sha'th, I believe that Maj. Gen. Shahaq stated 
that the Israeli delegation came to Taba to negotiate over what 
he called the Cairo document. What do you think of this 
statement? 
  [Sha'th] I believe this news has also been distorted. We are 
negotiating on the basis of the Declaration of Principles and 
the Cairo concepts. On some of these concepts the two 
delegations are close to each other and on others they are far 
apart. Hence, there is no such thing as a Cairo agreement, 
merely several concepts. Doubtless, we will profit from the 
ideas on which we have agreed. We will continue negotiating to 
reach agreement on the rest. 
  [Husayn] Dr. Sha'th, the Israeli delegation reportedly 
presented 10 different maps to the Palestinian negotiators 
yesterday, Tuesday. How true is this? What can you tell us 
about the maps? 
  [Sha'th] True. They submitted maps about new areas they have 
added to Jericho. They also submitted maps reducing the 
security areas around the Gaza settlements. They also proposed 
architectural plans for the border crossing buildings. All this 
reflected Israeli positions, which, although more advanced, 
remain insufficient for Palestinian purposes. 
  [Husayn] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, in a move seen by observers as 
U.S. intervention, or rather assistance, the U.S. State 
Department issued a statement yesterday, Tuesday, urging the 
Palestinian and Israeli delegations to find prompt solutions to 
the unresolved issues. Do you see any significance in this U.S. 
statement? 
  [Sha'th] I believe the Americans want the Palestinians and 
Israelis to make some progress before the meeting between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. I believe that 
pressure should be applied to the Israelis. As for us, we are 
willing to achieve results as fast as possible. 
  [Husayn] Will you ask Egypt, the United States, or any other 
party to intervene if the Israeli attitude remains the same? 
  [Sha'th] Naturally, if there is no progress. The Egyptians 
maintain constant contact with us and are following every 
development. 
  [Husayn] We thank Dr. Nabil Sha'th. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Hammud Munsir in Sanaa </F>
and Lutfi Shatarah in Aden: "Yemen: Accusations of Arms Imports 
and Controversy Over Dialogue"] 
  [Excerpts] The Yemeni General People's Congress [GPC] and 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] have exchanged accusations 
about military deals under which arms and ammunition have been 
delivered to each. GPC sources said yesterday that a military 
transport plane arrived in Aden the night before last and again 
last night and was parked in the military section of the airport 
where it unloaded its cargo, and that a cargo ship was anchored 
at some distance from the coast and its cargo was being 
transported to the shore by small cargo boats. 
  In reply, a YSP spokesman said that these "rumors are part 
of 
a campaign to poison the dialogue atmosphere and distort the 
YSP's efforts to end the country's crisis." He added that the 
aim "is to conceal the military movements of the other party 
which has intensified its arms import operations through 
Djibouti to al-Mukha port." 
  This comes as the "National Dialogue Committee for resolving 
the Yemeni crisis" is preparing to announce the results achieved 
today. Observers fear that the committee may have reached a 
dead end after weeks of discussions in Sanaa and Aden despite 
the fact that a subcommittee has redrafted the final paper on 
the basis for building the state, combining the proposals 
approved by the members of the tripartite ruling coalition (the 
GPC, the YSP, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG]), in addition 
to the opposition's National Bloc. [passage omitted] 
  Dialogue Committee sources have expressed pessimism about 
the 
possibility of finding solutions acceptable to all parties 
because of the sensitive nature of the YSP's demands. They 
added that if no such solutions are achieved then the committee 
would divulge to the Yemeni people all the phases it passed 
through, reveal the secret issues, and expose the party which 
caused the failure of the dialogue. Other sources, however, are 
optimistic. They say that matters were proceeding "contrary to 
people's expectations." They emphasized that if the proposals 
-- which are opposed by the GPC and the YRG -- are approved then 
the leaders of the parties would be called to an urgent meeting 
to sign the agreement documents which would include formation of 
a government of national accord to implement what was agreed and 
to prepare for new elections within a period not exceeding two 
years. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul says the problem with 
Israel is political, not security, and that no security 
committee will be worthwhile if the political issue--namely 
occupation--is not resolved. He pledged that the Army will 
assume responsibility for security in the south after the 
occupation has been ended, and that there will be no weapons in 
the south other than those of the Army. 
  The minister, who was talking to the dean of editors Milhim 
Karam, said any linkage between the Syrian presence in Lebanon 
and the Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory is treason. He 
explained that the Syrian presence is requested by the 
government for pressing needs related to the reunification of 
Lebanon. He said the Army's main mission is to take charge of 
security in the south and ensure that no armed force other than 
the legitimate forces will be present there. 
  The defense minister categorically denied the possibility of 
incorporating agent Lahd militias [South Lebanese Army] into the 
Lebanese Army. This matter exclusively concerns Lebanese 
authority, he said. Dallul said the Army must always reflect 
the country's pride and might. He said the Army is obtaining 
weapons to defend the country and serve the citizens and their 
security. He pointed out that Army roadblocks are established 
only for security reasons, not political ones. 
  On the security situation in the country, Minister Dallul 
stressed that no one can prevent the judiciary from opening any 
file. He expected the security agencies to complete the 
investigations on the bombing of the Phalangist Party 
headquarters very soon. He praised improvements in the security 
services and the military establishment. 
  Dallul described the upcoming Syrian-U.S. summit as historic 
and decisive for the region's crisis, especially Israel's 
occupation of Syrian and Lebanese territory. He expected the 
summit to result in major progress in the negotiations and 
relations with the West, notably the United States.

  [Text] Baghdad, Jan 11 (AFP) -- Talks between Iraq and the 
United Nations on the embargo in force since August 1990 have 
been delayed by two weeks, a UN official said here Tuesday. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz had said the negotiations 
would be held in mid-January in New York. But the UN official 
said they would now open at the end of the month or in early 
February. 
  "The two sides are busy compiling the necessary documents 
before the next round of negotiations," the official told AFP, 
asking not to be named. "They need two weeks to prepare for the 
meeting." 
  He also said that long-term monitoring of Iraq's post-war 
weapons programmes "has in effect started." 
  Aziz informed the United Nations on November 27 that Baghdad 
accepted long-term monitoring, under the terms of the ceasefire 
to the 1991 Gulf war which drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. 
  Iraq is expected to argue at the New York talks that it has 
met the conditions for the lifting of the embargo, which was 
imposed after its August 1990 invasion of the emirate. 
  But Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN disarmament commission, has 
proposed a six-month trial period for long-term monitoring 
before an end to the embargo.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 12, IRNA -- The English daily TEHRAN 
TIMES in its editorial Wednesday [12 January] said the terrorist 
Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO) was behind the last Sunday 
attack on the British Embassy in Tehran as it would benefit from 
Iran's strained diplomatic relations with Western Europe. 
  Referring to the previous attack on the French Embassy and 
the Air France office in Tehran on November 9, the paper said, 
"undoubtedly the two instances of attacks on the foreign 
embassies in Tehran, involving in both cases European countries, 
are related to one another and are in fact links in a chain of 
premediated plots which are carried out with specific 
objectives." 
  It stressed that such acts of terrorism are meant "to damage 
the international prestige of the Islamic Republic." 
  "In the past few months the Islamic Republic had undertaken 
active diplomatic initiatives to resolve its problems with some 
of the European countries and it had attained great progress in 
this direction. 
  "In the majority of cases the diplomatic initiatives taken 
by 
the Islamic Republic have been successful, and a broad range of 
understandings had been achieved. The most concrete sign of the 
improvement of relations between Iran and the Western Europe is 
the release of the two Iranian citizens by the French 
Government," said the article. 
  It further added, "consequently it is quite logical to 
conclude that the attacks on the embassies are meant to 
undermine Iran's recent improved relations with the Western 
European countries. 
  "Terrorist acts including attacks on embassies have always 
been condemned by the Islamic Republic as irrational endeavors 
which defeat their own purpose." 
  The editorial in conclusion called for taking concrete 
measures to forestall any attempt which aims to sabotage Iran's 
diplomatic achievements and for tightening security measures 
around embassy compounds.

  [Text] Colombo, Jan 10 (AFP) -- A Sri Lankan military 
inquiry has found virtually the entire northern high command 
responsible for a Tamil Tiger guerrilla asssault that left at 
least 637 soldiers dead, defence sources said Monday. 
  The military panel found seven senior officers, including 
the 
military intelligence chief, responsible for the unprecedented 
assault on the northern Pooneryn army and navy complex on 
November 11, the sources said. 
  Former army commander General Cecil Waidyaratne, who 
resigned 
at the end of December after taking responsibility for the 
attack, forwarded the findings of the inquiry to President 
Dingiri Banda Wijetunga on Sunday. 
  "Yes. I took responsibility but not the blame. Like Jesus 
Christ, I had to take responsibility for the others. I was 
crucified, while others slept," Waidyaratne told AFP. 
  He said the military panel appointed by him apportioned 
blame 
on officers found responsible for not preventing the debacle, 
but it was up to the government to initiate either court martial 
proceedings or take any other action. 
  Military sources said the findings of the four-man court ran 
to nearly 200 pages and was a serious indictment of the 
military's field commanders leading the battle against 
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). 
  A lieutenant colonel, who was promoted full colonel for 
holding out against the LTTE for three straight days at 
Pooneryn, was also found to be partly responsible for the 
debacle, the sources said. 
  The court of inquiry passed strictures against the northern 
commander Major General Rohan Daluwatte, chief of military 
intelligence Brigadier L. Balagalle, two other brigadiers, a 
colonel, a lieutenant colonel and a major. 
  They said the military would have to rethink its war 
strategy 
against the LTTE following the report submitted by the court 
compromising three brigadiers and a colonel, the sources said. 
  The LTTE is leading a protracted guerrilla campaign to 
establish an independent homeland in Sri Lanka's northern and 
eastern regions where the two million Tamil minority is 
concentrated.

  [Text] The Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] has begun 
fresh initiatives to end the fighting between rival factions in 
Afghanistan and to establish a durable peace there. Dr. 
(Ibrahim Hasan Al-Bakr), the special envoy of the ICO secretary 
general, had extensive talks with representatives of various 
Afghan organizations in Peshawar today. They exchanged views on 
all aspects of the ongoing war and new prospects for the 
establishment of peace. The ICO special envoy urged rival 
factions to stop the fighting immediately. 
  Meanwhile, reports from Afghanistan say that sporadic 
clashes 
have occurred between government forces and the Dostam militia 
in the northern and southeastern areas of Kabul. It is reported 
that the Dostam militia's jet planes bombed various places. 
  PPI says that Afghan President Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani 
has declared that the current war in Afghanistan has entered a 
decisive stage, which will continue until victory is achieved. 
Talking by telephone from Kabul to a group of Lahore 
journalists in Peshawar, Rabbani said that the war is not a war 
to secure power, but a war between the religious and what he 
called communist forces. The Afghan president claimed that the 
Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], the Dostam 
militia, and Mojaddedi are aligned with Hekmatyar, while all the 
other big and small organizations are against them. He said 
that the current war has been forced on the Afghan Government 
and is harming the Afghan people.

  [Text] The Afghan prime minister, Mr. Golboddin Hekmatyar 
Khan, is no longer a member of the Borhanoddin Rabbani 
government. In a statement, the minister of state for foreign 
affairs, Dr. Najibollah Lafra'i, said by attempting the coup, 
Mr. Hekmatyar has brought about a situation in which it will be 
self-contradictory and incompatible to further consider him as 
being part of the government. The minister's statement was 
released by the Afghan Embassy in New Delhi.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Amir Taheri] </F>
  [Text] London--Each of the Afghan mojahedin groups is 
striving to achieve the most regional victories and gains 
possible, before winter makes fighting difficult. For this 
reason, these competing groups have entered into the most 
violent battles the country has known in the 20-month-old civil 
war. 
  Each group describes itself as "Islamic," and this is a 
characteristic which they adopted in the 1980's to distinguish 
the mojahedin from the Communist regime in Kabul supported by 
the Soviets. This characteristic had an impact which enabled the 
mojahedin groups to make religion an opposition ideology in its 
struggle with the Communist regime of Kabul. It also helped them 
achieve great support from various Islamic states. In April 
1992, after losing Soviet support, the Communist regime fell. 
The mojahedin groups retained their "Islamic" symbols, but it 
was quickly evident that the groups were not set up or acting on 
a religious basis but according to their ethnic backgrounds. 
  The group led by Borhanoddin Rabbani, the president ad-hoc 
of 
the country, calls itself Jam'iat-e Eslami [The Islamic 
Society], but this group has principly become a political tool 
to impose Tajik hegemony over Afghanistan. There are, of course, 
people from other ethnic groups who belong to Rabbani's 
organization, but the core of the organization remains a group 
of Tajik Sunni Muslims who speak Persian. 
  The strong man in this group is Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, the 
talented military commander who played the decisive role in the 
fall of the Communist regime headed by Mohammad Najibollah. At 
that time, hope spread that Mas'ud would use his irrefutable 
organizational talents and leadership abilities to form a new 
national alliance and coalition going beyond the ethnic 
limitations, but nothing of that sort happened. 
  Rabbani also enjoys the support of Esma'il Khan, the 
governor 
of Herat and a former army officer under the Communist regime. 
Here also, ethnic loyalty, not religious feeling, played the 
greatest role in determining Esma'il Khan's loyalty to Rabbani 
and Mas'ud, the two senior Tajik leaders. 
  It is worth noting that the Tajiks form 30 percent of the 
population and that they have not been afforded the chance to 
govern Afghanistan with the exception of six months during which 
the revolutionary Habibollah Khan, known as "Bacheh-ye Saqa" 
[son of Saqa], reigned in 1921. 
  It appears that the Tajiks are now planning to lose no 
opportunity--as they have vowed historically--afforded them to 
gain control in the Afghan Government. 
  The group commanded by "General" 'Abdol Rashid Dos Tam, 
bears 
the exalted name of "The Islamic National Party," but it is 
"Islamic" in name only, because most of its leadership is made 
up of former Communists who compete in boasting of, spreading, 
and advertising their heresies. The internal regime and goals of 
this party are a clear copy of the Communist Party's regime and 
programs without mentioning the term "Communist." 
  In the past year, the city of Mazar-i Sharif, the northern 
city that Dostam has taken for his headquarters, has been an 
assembly point for former officials, Army officers and cadres of 
the Communist Party and its regime. However, Dostam's party is 
also not "national." It is the political organization for those 
of Uzbek descent, who form 10 percent of Afghanistan's 
population. 
  Proof is mounting of the ethnic nature of Dostam's party 
with 
the support that has been afforded it by neighboring Uzbekistan. 
So the party is more an Uzbek organization than it is an 
organization of Islamic convictions and feelings. 
  The third group in the current conflict is the "Hezb-e 
Afghanistan-e Eslami," [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] led by 
Golboddin Hekmatyar, who officially presumes to be the prime 
minister, but who has not taken on this role and has no right to 
do so. However, Hekmatyar's party is increasingly pressing to be 
the representative of Pashtun political aspirations. In other 
words, this party is also no more than an organization 
established on ethnic grounds. 
  Like Rabbani's party, Hekmatyar's organization includes 
elements from other ethnic groups, but the sensitive leadership 
positions are vested in Pashtuns, who form 90 percent of the 
members of the party. Hekmatyar's party enjoyed the support of 
both the United States and Pakistan during the war against 
Soviet hegemony. The major motive for the Pakistani support is 
that Pakistan itself includes 15 million Pashtuns. 
  The fourth group in the conflict is an organization that 
calls itself by the name "Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami" [the Islamic 
Unity Party], but it also uses the term "Islamic" as no more 
than an emblem or slogan. The truth is that this party is an 
organization for Afghan Shi'ism supported by Iran. [Shi'ites] 
form about 18 percent of the Sunni-majority population. It is 
not a matter of religious doctrine, since the Shi'ites belong to 
the Hezarah people, an ethnic group of Mongol origin. 
  Shi'ites in Afghanistan receive support from Iran not only 
because they are Twelvers, but also because they speak Persian. 
There are six other parties which, without exception, use the 
term "Islamic," but all of them are formed on the basis of the 
ethnic rivalries and use religion as a mere external cover. The 
Turkomans, Nuristanis, Isma'ilis, and lesser Pashtun tribes have 
their political parties and organizations, but a penetrating 
glance at each of them discloses that they are clan 
organizations, not political parties, and that they have always 
existed in Afghanistan. 
  Has Afghanistan become another Somalia then? This question 
cannot be ignored. The truth is that the religious, ethnic, and 
tribal divisions in Afghanistan are deeper than they are in 
Somalia. 
  Some commentators and analysts are amazed that Hekmatyar's 
party, which claims to be "Islamic" and is viewed as 
"fundamentalist," has allied itself now with the former 
Communists against Rabbani. This is merely a small sample of the 
Afghan festival. Rabbani allies himself at times also with the 
Communists to prevent Hekmatyar from imposing his hegemony over 
Kabul. 
  The Afghan conflict is rapidly deteriorating into a clan war 
of the type the country suffered in the 19th Century. Today, 
Pakistan, Iran, and Uzbekistan have all deeply intervened in the 
Afghan conflict, and each of them support this or that group. 
Russia is not far from this stage of conflict. It is known that 
Russian forces are deployed primarily along the Tajik-Afghan and 
Turkoman-Afghan borders. Moscow has disclosed in no uncertain 
form that it will not accept the idea of the existence of a 
regime that is hostile to it in Kabul. In spite of the fact that 
Yeltsin's government pretends that it is anti-Communist, it is 
working with the new Communist regime in Tashkent and the other 
in Dushanbe. The main joint goal is the existence of a federal 
body in Afghanistan enabling all of the ethnic groups to obtain 
a large measure of independence. 
  Dostam is promoting the federal formula and is actually 
practicing it in Mazar-i Sharif, where he is behaving as if his 
city were an independent statelet. He is hoping that Hekmatyar 
and Rabbani will destroy each other, thus leaving the field open 
for the appearance of an Uzbek-Communist-Isma'ili alliance which 
would become capable of molding the future of Afghanistan. His 
calculations, however, met a setback when Rabbani decided to 
launch attacks on Dostam in his stronghold. Dostam's response 
was to attack Rabbani's positions in Kabul. The following step, 
logically, was to make an alliance with Hekmatyar. 
  Perhaps one of the historical divisions which caused the 
first battle between Rabbani and Hekmatyar to break out is the 
fact that the latter wanted to arrest Dostam and put him on 
trial for treason. Hekmatyar had boycotted the government of 
Sebghatollah Mojaddedi and then that of 'Abdol Sabur Farid 
because they refused to issue orders to arrest Dostam. 
  Hekmatyar and Dostam--who has been characterized as "a 
Communist mercenary and leader of a gang of thieves"--are now 
two allies pretending to fight for the exaltation of the cause 
of Islam. 
  This alliance will not be the last marvel in Afghanistan. 
This sad country will witness more wonders and restiveness.

  [Text] Taba, 12 Jan (MENA)--Hasan 'Asfur, head of the 
Security Committee at the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in 
Taba, has said that the agreement that will be reached after 
Taba talks on the implementation of the Declaration of 
Principles is divided into four sections: the general principles 
section--which will define terms in general--a security annex, a 
civilian annex, and an economic annex. 
  In an exclusive statement, he said that the agreement 
reached 
by the Economic Committee in Paris will help conclude the civil 
agreement. 
  'Asfur said differences over the three main issues of 
Jericho's size, the border crossings, and the security of 
settlements still exist. He said all issues will be discussed 
regardless of the Israeli claims that these issues were decided 
at the Cairo meeting. 
  The Palestinian official said that an agreement has been 
reached to place the Musa al-'Alami project under Palestinian 
supervision and to keep the 3-km-deep security region containing 
land mines between Jordan and Jericho under Israeli supervision. 
The two sides also agreed to establish "a safe passage" between 
Gaza and Jericho by using an already existing road under Israeli 
security supervision and Palestinian protection, he said. There 
will be no need to build a new road or tunnel as proposed 
earlier, he added. 
  'Asfur explained that the issue of the border crossings has 
not been settled yet. He said the Palestinians want the King 
Husayn Bridge with Jordan to be under Palestinian administrative 
authority and for it to be connected with Jericho by a special 
road under full Palestinian supervision. He said the same 
measures will be applied to the Rafah crossing in Gaza. 
  Concerning Gaza, 'Asfur said, the Palestinian delegation is 
not asking for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the strip at 
this stage, but is demanding that the area of the settlements be 
reduced to no more than 6 percent of the strip's overall area, 
not 10 percent as the Israelis are demanding. It is more 
important, he said, that the Israeli military presence in Gaza 
be reduced, that the geographic and political unity of the strip 
remain untouched, and that the strip not be divided by Israeli 
roads to protect the settlements, as this would divide Gaza into 
a form of Palestinian settlement and undermine its geographic 
unity. He said the Gaza Strip must be a security, geographic, 
and political unit under the self-rule authority. 
  The Palestinian official stressed the importance of the 
Israelis respecting the set three-week period for the talks and 
withdrawing fully from Gaza and Jericho before 13 April in 
accordance with the Declaration of Principles signed in 
Washington on 13 September.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jamil al-Tarifi, Palestinian co-chairman of </F>
the Civic Committee at the Taba Talks with Israel, by Hasan 
Abu-Zayid at Taba Hotel on 12 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Tarifi] We convened two sessions yesterday, 
including a restricted one attended by committee chairmen and 
the chief Palestinian and Israeli delegates. We reviewed the 
remaining items -- there were approximately 19 -- on the Civic 
Committee's agenda. These include direct and indirect taxes, 
the treasury, and other items that were also addressed by the 
Economic Committee's talks in Paris. We also (?found) a way to 
transfer powers in these areas. As for outstanding issues, we 
will try to finalize them next week. These include such things 
as electricity, water, highways [al-turuq al-'ammah], pension 
funds, etc... Today we looked at archeology; we are not through 
with this subject yet. We will also discuss water-related 
issues and city planning next week. 
  [Abu-Zayid] The Civic Committee is said to have made 
tangible progress from the beginning. 
  [Al-Tarifi] The problems the Civic Committee has to contend 
with are fewer than those encountered by other committees. This 
is not to say that we did not encounter any obstacles. 
Yesterday, we worked out ways to surmount hurdles. 
  [Abu-Zayid] What are the issues that have yet to be dealt 
with by the Civic Committee? 
  [Al-Tarifi] We transferred the work of approximately 20 
authorities, and about 19 authorities remain. I think that, God 
willing, next week will see us complete their transfer. 
  [Abu-Zayid] And what about the water issue? 
  [Al-Tarifi] We will address that next week, God willing. 
  [Abu-Zayid] You looked at the archeology issue today. 
  [Al-Tarifi] That's right. We exchanged ideas about the 
issue. The Israeli side brought along experts and we had one. 
We had a general exchange of ideas ahead of a more detailed 
discussion next week about a transfer of authority and powers to 
the Palestinians. 
  [Abu-Zayid] What is your assessment of this week's talks in 
Taba? 
  [Al-Tarifi] I think the resumption of the talks in itself is 
something extremely positive. We hope we will wrap up our work 
as quickly as possible. However, we should not let ourselves be 
unduly constrained by the time element, since this accord is 
supposed to meet our national aspirations and the Palestinian 
understanding of the accord. The time factor is important for 
the Palestinians. We must realize, however, that it is equally 
important for the Israelis. But let us not let ourselves become 
obsessed with the time factor by committing ourselves to a time 
frame of one week or two or three. More importantly, we must 
implement the accord so as to meet national Palestinian 
aspirations. 
  [Abu-Zayid] The Security Committee is moving slowly, isn't 
it? 
  [Al-Tarifi] The nature of the problems there, I think, is 
somewhat intractable. But we hope they will be sorted out. 
  [Abu-Zayid] We were given to understand the talks will 
conclude today. 
  [Al-Tarifi] You understood right.

  [Text] Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli 
delegation to the Taba talks, said a short while ago that the 
first week of talks ended without a breakthrough on security 
issues. At the same time, he stressed that understandings have 
been achieved on several issues regarding the transfer of 
civilian authority. On the phone from Taba is our correspondent 
Netan'el Semrik: 
  A short time ago, the first week of the Taba talks ended. 
Let us hear a statement made here a few minutes ago by the head 
of the Israeli delegation, Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahaq: 
  [Begin Shahaq recording] Today we are concluding the talks 
for this week, to my regret, because of last night's tragedy. 
Most of the delegates are leaving to attend the funeral of the 
Maj. Gen. Nehemya Tamari tomorrow. We had planned to be here 
until tomorrow night, and we will return here next Monday [17 
January] to continue the talks. 
  Over the past week, we continued the meetings of both the 
Security and the Civilian Committees. We have not reached full 
conclusion on any of the issues. We have, however, definitely 
reached understandings on more than one of the civilian issues. 
We will continue the negotiations in both fields next week.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Dahlan, member of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the Taba talks, by Gay Bekhor in Taba on 11 
January] 
  [Text] "In the meeting Amnon Shahaq and Jacques Neriya had 
with me and Jibril Rajab in Rome a `gentlemen's agreement' was 
reached on a cease-fire between the Fatah Hawks and the Israeli 
Government. It was agreed that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
and the Fatah Hawks would not fire at each other, and the 
agreement has so far been honored. It was also agreed that the 
Fatah Hawks would not keep firearms, which would only be held by 
the Fatah apparatus in the Gaza Strip." 
  These remarks were made yesterday by former Fatah Hawks 
commander Muhammad Dahlan, in an interview with HA'ARETZ. 
Dahlan is now one of the leaders of Fatah Tunis' security 
apparatus, after being deported from the Gaza Strip by Israel. 
Dahlan and other Fatah leaders are expected to receive 
significant control on the ground when the withdrawal agreement 
is implemented. 
  [Bekhor] Dahlan, let us assume a Palestinian terrorist 
commits murder in Israeli territory and escapes to territory 
under Palestinian control. What will be his fate? 
  [Dahlan] It seems to me that we would try him, but that is 
something that still has to be negotiated. There are hundreds 
of similar questions, such as the area of jurisdiction, which 
will be discussed in the negotiations. 
  [Bekhor] The delegations are now discussing the upcoming 
withdrawal from Gaza, and a central issue, such as the area of 
jurisdiction, has still not been resolved? 
  [Dahlan] I am sure that such issues can be solved within two 
hours. Anyway, we already have a plan to safeguard the roads 
within the Palestinian area. 
  [Bekhor] What about intelligence coordination with the Shin 
Bet? 
  [Dahlan] That has still not been discussed, but is due to 
come up in the respective committee. Cooperation between the 
Israel Police and the Palestinian police has already been 
discussed, but how to deal with terrorism has still not been 
worked out. We are divided on the basic issue of what 
constitutes terrorism. 
  [Bekhor] How do you plan to deal with the problem of 
collaborators? 
  [Dahlan] They all belong to the underworld: pimps and drug 
dealers who found refuge in Israel, so take them. This is our 
decision and the decision of Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]: Take 
them, and we, for humanitarian reasons, will take only their 
women and children. In the past a decision was made to 
liquidate the collaborators, but after the signing of the 
agreement in Washington in September, the approach changed. 
That was also the leadership's decision. 
  [Bekhor] In the past there were rumors that you had ordered 
the extermination of Fatah activist Muhammad Abu-Sha'ban. 
  [Dahlan] They are only rumors. The Fatah Hawks have no part 
in murders. Had Fatah done it, it would have been known. I was 
a friend of Muhammad's. 
  [Bekhor] How do you think the Palestinian security system 
will deal with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] activists? 
  [Dahlan] I can tell you that we agreed that there would be 
no terrorism between the Palestinian entity and the Islamic 
elements. 
  [Bekhor] The bad relations between the nationalist regimes 
and the Islamic streams are, in fact, a regional problem. 
  [Dahlan] In the Palestinian camp it is different. Hamas and 
Islamic Jihad are anti-Israeli and not anti-Palestinian. They 
are not opposed to us. 
  [Bekhor] What is the security outlook that will guide you on 
your return to the Gaza Strip? 
  [Dahlan] The way we see the security issue is different from 
how the Shin Bet views it. Their concept is built on threats, 
revenge, and undermining, while we will base our policy on four 
things: First, forging a link between the Palestinian people 
and their security apparatus. Second, building a security 
system that will be accompanied by economic and social moves, 
which will reduce the level of pressure on the Palestinians. 
Third, we intend to employ young men with a security background 
in our security system, nationalists with whom others can 
identify. 
  [Bekhor] In other words, men on the wanted list? 
  [Dahlan] You can call them that. Fourth, there will be 
cooperation between the Palestinian and Israeli systems. We 
will use all the Shin Bet and IDF installations, which will be 
evacuated when the withdrawal starts. We agreed between us that 
the Army and police will not destroy any installations but will 
transfer them to us. 
  [Bekhor] Have the commanders of the Palestinian police force 
and the security apparatus already been appointed? 
  [Dahlan] No names have not been finalized. There is a 
security committee in Tunis, of which I am a member, and the 
commanders will be chosen from among the members. 
  [Bekhor] Who will appoint the commanders? 
  [Dahlan] Abu-'Ammar does the appointing. Who else makes 
such appointments in the Third World?

  [Text] Cairo, 12 Jan (MENA)--The Arab League Secretariat 
General has denounced Israel's building of a new settlement in 
Jerusalem. In a statement issued today, the Arab League said: 
At a time when all international and Arab efforts are being 
devoted to establishing permanent and just peace in the Middle 
East on the basis of the implementation of the UN Security 
Council resolutions, Israel is defying the international will by 
continuing to establish settlements in the Arab territories. 
The latest was the establishment of a new settlement on the 
Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. 
  The Arab League affirmed that this settlement is considered 
a 
link in the chain of Israeli attempts to Judaize the Arab 
territories. It also comes in the wake of the Israeli Supreme 
Court's decision on 23 September 1993 to regard the al-Aqsa 
Mosque as part of Israeli territory. 
  The statement said: While strongly condemning this Israeli 
measure because it constitutes a grave violation of the will of 
the international community and the resolutions of international 
legitimacy, particularly UN Security Council Resolution 252, the 
Arab League Secretariat General views this measure as an attempt 
to impose a fait accompli. It also views this measure as a big 
obstacle in the way of the current peace talks to implement the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement, which stipulates that the 
Jerusalem issue will be discussed within the framework of a 
final solution. 
  The statement called on the international community and all 
the effective forces in the world to put an end to the 
deliberate Israeli violations in the occupied Arab territories 
in implementation of the principles and resolutions of 
international legitimacy and to safeguard the unique character 
of Jerusalem as a city where the heavenly religions and human 
civilizations coexist.

  [Text] Cairo, 13 Jan (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid met French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe 
and his delegation today. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said afterward that they discussed several 
important issues, including the Middle East peace process, the 
Libyan-Western problem, Bosnia, and the Euro-Arab dialogue. He 
added that they exchanged views on promoting ties between France 
and Arab countries and discussed cooperation among the 
Mediterranean basin countries in light of France's relations 
with European and Arab countries and with the Mediterranean 
countries in general. 
  He said he explained the Arab view on the Lockerbie issue 
and 
expressed his appreciation of Egyptian and Tunisian efforts in 
this regard. He called for not escalating the situation and for 
treating Libya in a manner that will preserve its rights. 
  On Middle East peace, he said they discussed France's 
support 
for the peace process. The French side, he added, asserted its 
concern that the timetable agreed by the Israeli and Palestinian 
sides should be respected and that peace should be comprehensive 
and just. 
  As for Iraq, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said he and the French 
minister exchanged views on it. He affirmed that the Arab 
League wants to ensure Iraq's unity and territorial integrity 
and the need for Iraq to respect Security Council resolutions 
and Kuwait's sovereignty as an independent state. 
  Asked about the crisis in Yemen, the Arab League secretary 
general said: We are in touch with the brothers in Yemen and 
the dialogue committee will pursue its task. He noted all the 
Yemeni parties' interest in unity as a primary principle and in 
finding a solution within the general framework of the agreement 
between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid. He said he would not hesitate if he were given the 
chance to go to Yemen to participate in the reconciliation 
efforts.

  [Excerpts] Lieutenant General 'Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir, 
president of the republic, this morning addressed at the 
Friendship Hall the consultative meeting held by the Federal 
Rule Office for leaders of the executive organ, the Armed 
Forces, and the police forces for the purpose of studying the 
options submitted by the higher committee for the redivision of 
states. 
  The president of the republic affirmed in his address the 
importance of the redivision at this very time since it involves 
the curtailment of the administrative shadow [as heard], the 
provision of more federalism, and the handing over of power to 
the masses. He denied that the financial cost of the project or 
the distribution of the human cadre was an obstacle preventing 
the implementation of the redivision recommendations, pointing 
out in this respect the success of the experiment on the 
redivision of states. [passage omitted] 
  Dr. Ali al-Hajj Muhammad, minister in the Federal Rule 
Office 
and rapporteur of the committee, presented a comprehensive 
explanation at the beginning of the meeting, supported by maps 
detailing the options arrived at by the committee. He explained 
that the number of states in Sudan will rise to 25, by dividing 
each state into three states, with the exception of the northern 
state which it was decided will be divided into two states only; 
whereas the committee recommended the division of the central 
state into four states. It also decided to keep Khartoum state 
as it is -- one state.

<F P=106> [Kamal Hamid, 'Umar al-Hasan, and Fatinah al-Dajani report: </F>
"Sudanese National Assembly Deputy Speaker Seeks Asylum in 
Britain"] 
  [Excerpt] Khartoum, London -- Aldo Ajo, deputy speaker of 
the Sudanese Transitional National Assembly (appointed 
parliament), announced in London yesterday his decision to 
resign from his post, because of his inability to influence his 
government's policy to solve the country's problems, especially 
with regard to the establishment of peace in the south. 
  He stated that he has decided to cooperate with the Sudanese 
opposition to topple President 'Umar al-Bashir's regime. 
  Clashes have broken out once again in the south between 
government forces and the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, 
while the statements made by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, secretary 
general of the Popular Arab and Islamic Conference [and leader 
of the National Islamic Front], about a dialogue being conducted 
between the authorities and the parties inside and outside the 
country has provoked violent reactions from the government. 
  At a news conference in London, Ajo said that he had applied 
for political asylum in Britain. He stated that he left 
Khartoum for Cairo on 1 December on 30-day leave with his 
family, them moved on 15 December to London, where he decided to 
announce his resignation and seek asylum. He declined to say 
whether he had decided on his resignation and escape from Sudan 
before or after his visit to London. 
  He stressed that he had agreed to join the government after 
the successful military coup led by Lieutenant General 'Umar 
al-Bashir four years ago in the hope of influencing the 
government's policy "in order to eliminate the tension between 
north and south and to establish peace in the south. But I was 
wrong, as this government does not want peace." 
  He added that he had decided to cooperate with the Sudanese 
opposition in all its tendencies and groups, stressing that 
"only force is capable of removing the Sudanese regime, which is 
not concerned about citizens' death." He attacked the regime's 
unseriousness in solving the south problem and establishing 
party pluralism. He also spoke about "the regime's scheme to 
Islamize the south." He cited constitutional decree No. 7 
endorsed by the Revolutionary Command Council for National 
Salvation on the eve of its dissolution. 
  He went on: "The regime's supporters gather southern 
children from the refugee camps to which they fled in Khartoum, 
southern Darfur, southern Kordofan, and southern towns like Juba 
and Malakal, which are all under government control. They take 
the children to secret camps, where they force them to join 
religious schools and military training centers in north Sudan 
to prepare them to fight against the south." "I believe that a 
true and lasting peace is possible if the the people of the 
south are allowed to exercise their right to self-determination 
through a referendum to determine their political future." 
  Meanwhile, al-Turabi's statements about a dialogue being 
conducted with the Sudanese parties inside and outside the 
country have provoked violent reactions from the government. 
  Official sources emphasized to AL-HAYAH yesterday that the 
government, which dissolved the parties, cannot conduct a 
reconciliation with them. "But if contacts take place, they 
will be with figures in isolation from their parties." [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Kuwait, 12 Jan -- Defense Minister Shaykh 'Ali 
al-Sabah stressed his commitment to the defense-bolstering 
budget on which a report had been prepared by the joint 
committee composed of the interior and defense and foreign 
affairs committees, to be submitted to the finance committee. 
  In a statement to KUNA here today, Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah 
said: 
Our commitment to the defense-bolstering budget stems from the 
public interest. 
  On his part, 'Abbas Munawir, chairman of the interior and 
defense committee, said that the joint committee had approved 
the defense-bolstering budget. 
  He indicated that the final decision regarding this matter 
lay with the National Assembly after the finance committee 
discusses the issue. Munawir revealed that the Defense Ministry 
had spent around 1.6 billion dinars out of the total budget, 
which amounts to 3.5 billion dinars. 
  Munawir said that four deputies had voted for the budget 
while three voted against it, and one abstained; the overall 
result was, therefore, approval. 
  In another development, Munawir said that the committee had 
agreed to take into consideration the voluntary period served by 
those who joined the army during the treacherous Iraqi 
occupation and considered it as a part of the service. 
  He added that the committee had discussed the possibility of 
promoting military personnel who are holders of a general 
certificate of secondary education or higher; Munawir indicated 
that the head of the military judiciary body had said that that 
system had been in force for a long time.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Efforts To Release Experts Held by </F>
Yemeni Tribe Stumble"] 
  [Text] Sanaa, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Yemeni tribal sources 
have confirmed that the mediation efforts for the release of the 
experts held by one of the Yemeni tribes in the area of Khawlan 
for the past 10 days are continuing. 
  In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, one of the 
mediators, a tribal chief, told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: The six 
hostages and their helicopter were yesterday evening still being 
held by the Shudayq tribe some 110 km from Sanaa but various 
mediations are under way by tribal chiefs, parliamentarians, and 
officers to persuade the Shudayq tribes to release the hostages, 
who include a British expert, the Canadian pilot, and four 
Yemenis. The tribes, however, are requesting that the state 
provide public services for their region such as completion of 
the building of schools, inclusion of their region in the 
electricity network plan, and introduction of drinking water 
projects, medical services, and other projects. 
  Sources have denied yesterday's reports about the release of 
the hostages. They said that Shaykh Muhammad Yayha 
al-Ruwayshan, from Khawlan, initiated a mediation the day before 
yesterday to persuade the Shudayq tribe to release the hostages 
but the tribe holding the experts -- employees of the U.S. 
company Hunt, which operates the Ma'rib oilfields area -- 
demanded definite guarantees that the state would grant and seek 
to fulfill its demands. These demands include five to 10 new 
Landrovers as security in return for the release of the 
detainees and their plane, provided these vehicles come from the 
state, not the mediators. 
  In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Shaykh 'Ali 
al-Qayri, who is one of the mediators, said that the mediators 
had contacted the official authorities in Sanaa to convey the 
kidnappers' demands and secure guarantees for the release of the 
hostages, but the authorities have so far refused to grant the 
kidnappers' demands and have been looking for ways of putting an 
end to these kinds of pressures, which have recently been 
frequent, and of putting an end to the kidnapping of foreign 
experts for use as a means of pressure on the official 
authorities. 
  He said that a number of senior officials told the mediators 
that the state was willing to discuss all legitimate demands 
with these people but outside the framework of pressure through 
the abduction of foreigners, a method which undermines Yemen's 
reputation in the world. 
  The helicopter and the six experts were kidnapped on the 
morning of the Monday before last in the area of al-Yamaniyah in 
Khawlan as the experts, including a Hunt company security 
official, were about to disarm a mine planted near the pipeline 
passing through that area. 
  According to press reports, the six experts are being well 
treated and have not been denied any requests because they 
themselves are not the target but the means used to put pressure 
on the official authorities and, therefore, are well taken care 
of.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, today paid a visit to the 
Ibb Governorate where he was received by the acting governor, 
officials, leading figures, representatives of political parties 
and organizations, tribal chiefs, and a large crowd of citizens. 
  Immediately upon arrival in Ibb, Salih met in the 
governorate's center with the brother officials in the 
governorate, the ulema, leading figures, and representatives of 
the political parties and organizations as well as mass 
organizations in the governorate. 
  In the meeting, Salih noted that his visit to Ibb this time 
differs from his previous visit because it comes amid this 
regrettable crisis. He said: I highly appreciate what I heard 
today from the orators and poets whose sincere speeches came 
from their hearts, reflecting the pain of our people because of 
this crisis which has been going on since 19 August 1993. We 
were expecting to begin a new year and to leave behind the 
previous year with all its tragedies and its political, social, 
and economic mistakes, and turn over a new leaf. The crisis is 
not among the united Yemeni people but is a crisis of confidence 
among certain leaderships that pursue their own interests to the 
detriment of public interests. There are some who speak of the 
masses and their problems while at the same time trying to 
realize personal gains. I say that we must uphold the interests 
of the homeland and rise above the interests of the rulers and 
officials in all centers and departments and on all levels. 
  The president said: Unity was realized because of the 
struggle by all the Yemenis. It is not just a gain for Yemen 
but a gain for the entire Arab nation. Unity has brought 
together the one Yemeni family. We had hoped that some of our 
colleagues and comrades in the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] 
leadership would be logical and reasonable and would let 
dialogue prevail rather than allowing other options to prevail. 
We hope that the Dialogue Committee will carry out its 
responsibility and speedily end its discussion of the problems 
and points on its agenda in order to enable the country to come 
out of the current impasse instead of this delay and waste of 
time. The conditions in the country are getting worse and the 
citizens conditions are deteriorating. There is a plan to 
create unrest among the citizens and to instigate riots and 
sabotage similar to what happened on 9 and 10 December 1992. 
There are those who are planning for the return to the old 
partition system, which we buried on 22 May 1990. 
  Salih said: All noble and sincere voices must be raised and 
all the forces, organizations, and political parties must oppose 
those who call for returning to the past. They must say: No to 
partition, yes to unity and peaceful dialogue, yes to security, 
stability, and peace. 
  Salih said: We must remember our people's suffering during 
the partition, especially in this governorate, Ibb, which 
suffered so much from the afflictions of partition. As 
officials, we must remember the suffering of our people. We 
must remember the poor and the powerless who are suffering 
because of the rise in prices as a result of the expanding and 
escalating crisis. The voice of right must be raised to tell 
the wrongdoer: You have erred. The problem is not the problem 
of 'Ali ['Abdallah Salih] and 'Ali [Salim al-Bid] but is 
connected with the responsibility of those who do not want our 
people to come out of this crisis, this affliction. 
  We have made concessions and given our consent to all the 
proposed solutions and showed ourselves to be keen on finding a 
quick way out of this crisis, whose origins our people know full 
well -- the people behind it, and those who stand to gain from 
it. 
  We have consented to all the points and demands made by our 
partners -- the YSP -- and have responded to the ulema's call to 
put things right. If I knew that any concessions on my part 
would keep my country and its unity from going down a hazardous 
and slippery road I would do it. The one thing that remains for 
me to do is to offer to resign my post as head of state -- 
something I am prepared to do for the sake of keeping the unity 
intact. If that is the problem, let brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid 
or the YSP come forward. 
  The chairman of the Presidential Council reviewed numerous 
issues and developments on the national scene, indicating that 
he intimated his approval of the system of local government and 
the enactment of legislation to regulate it so as to ensure 
decentralization and curb centralization. But the provincial 
system demanded by some amounts to a scheme to carve the country 
into mini-states and sultanates. We have united the Yemeni 
family and we should rally it together. So, how can we accept 
taking steps backward? We will not be responsible for 
sacrificing unity and will not allow infighting. We stand for 
responsible and objective dialogue. He pointed to certain 
erroneous practices that have been detrimental to unity and to 
the problems that have befallen the interim period. From this 
place, I call on brothers of the YSP to engage in dialogue, 
notwithstanding all the statements made against the president by 
some of its officials. I am an understanding person. To all of 
them I now say: May God forgive you. Let us turn over a new 
leaf and rise above our personal concerns, and work for the sake 
of our people's and country's supreme interests. I also call on 
the population of the Ibb Governorate and all our countrymen to 
help us maintain security, stability, peace, and unity. 
  Meanwhile, speeches made at the meeting expressed our 
people's anxiety over the political crisis our country is going 
through and the deep negative impact it has had on the citizens' 
economic, social, and psychological well-being. The speakers 
urged the political leadership to work to find quick solutions 
to this crisis, which is beginning to pose a threat to the 
homeland and the unity of the people who have made generous 
sacrifices for its sake. They emphasized that the Yemeni 
masses, who have been unstinting in their sacrifices for the 
sake of unity, are willing to make further sacrifices to 
preserve the homeland's unity and defend the gains of the 
revolution. The speakers urged the political leadership to be 
receptive to the call of the masses, submit to reason and the 
country's supreme interests, get together to work out a solution 
to this crisis, and address its repercussions. 
  The meeting also heard a statement issued by the 
governorate's population, which urged a reactivation of the 
government's various institutions so that they may discharge 
their national duties free of party, regional, personal, or 
confessional affiliations. They called for all violators of the 
duties and functions of public office to be called to account.

  [Excerpt] Sanaa, 13 Jan (INA)--Yemeni President Lieutenant 
General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has said he intends to go to Aden, 
in the south of Yemen, to meet with Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, who has been staying in Aden since 19 August 1993. 
  In press statements aired by the Yemeni Television last 
night, Salih said he would go to Aden, Hadramawt, or al-Dali' 
out of his concern to find quick solutions to the country's 
crisis, which is burdening the Yemeni people. 
  In his statements, the Yemeni president accused for the 
first 
time some leaders of the Yemeni Socialist Party, under Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, of not wanting to resort to logic 
and reason to overcome the crisis in the country. He said: I 
have realized that some of the demands are impossible and hide 
behind them a scheme, which exercises on the ground an 
undeclared secession. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued by the Political Forces Dialogue </F>
Committee on 12 January; place not given] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
The Political Forces Dialogue Committee had earlier set 10 
January 1994 as the deadline for completing the dialogue 
document, which must enshrine the bases for building the state 
and addressing the problems plaguing the homeland and its 
citizens, and which must also be used as a guide to defuse the 
ongoing crisis. The concern to reconcile the views of all 
participants made it impossible to reach agreement on this 
document on time. This prompted some forces taking part in the 
dialogue to say that they would not proceed with the dialogue 
unless the committee issues a statement, explaining the reasons 
and setting another deadline for completion of the document. 
  The Dialogue Committee favorably viewed a host of proposals 
submitted by the opposition bloc. Hence, the Dialogue Committee 
regrets the delay, which was not under the participants' 
control, and announces that 18 January 1994 shall be the last 
deadline for agreement on the draft document in preparation for 
its endorsement by the concerned parties. The political forces 
engaged in the dialogue pledge to our people's masses to do 
their utmost to complete the agreement document. It is God 
whose satisfaction and guidance we pray for.

<F P=106> [Lutfi Shataran report from Aden and unattributed AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT report from Sanaa: "Opposition Withdraws From Dialogue 
Committee and Condemns Positions of General People's Congress 
and Reform Grouping"] 
  [Excerpt] Representatives of the ruling coalition parties 
in the Dialogue Committee for resolving the Yemeni political 
crisis resumed their meetings yesterday afternoon at the home of 
Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, prime minister and member of 
the Political Bureau of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], in 
Aden, in the absence of representatives of the opposition's 
National Bloc who boycotted the committee's work and remained at 
the Aden Hotel where they have been staying since the beginning 
of this month while participating in the committee's meetings. 
They announced their withdrawal the night before last, saying 
that the dialogue had reached a dead end because of differences 
between the ruling coalition parties (the General People's 
Congress [GPC], the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], and the YSP) 
over local government, election methods, and formation of a 
shura council. 
  A statement issued by the Yemeni opposition said that these 
differences developed into exchanges of accusations, escalated 
by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's speech the day before 
yesterday in Ta'izz, over the aims some ruling coalition parties 
hoped to achieve through the meeting of the Yemeni Ulema Society 
at the Mu'adh Bin-Jabal Mosque in al-Jund, the disregard for the 
Dialogue Committee's efforts, and the House of Representatives 
decision to ask the prime minister and the ministers to withdraw 
from the Dialogue Committee and return to their posts to 
discharge their duties as members of the government. 
  In his Ta'izz speech, the Yemeni president accused the YSP 
of 
"seeking secession" with funds from certain Arab states. In 
reply, the YSP issued a statement expressing interest in 
preserving Yemeni unity and in continuing efforts to build a 
modern state. It condemned the "lies and abuse" aimed at it. 
It expressed confidence that the Arab states mentioned in the 
speech were eager "to establish cordial relations based on 
mutual respect, sovereignty, fraternal cooperation, and good 
neighborliness" with Yemen. 
  The opposition's statement accused the ruling parties of 
serving their own interests, not the people's interests. It 
added that "the opposition submitted reasonable papers and 
serious proposals for ending the crisis and laying the 
foundations for stability in the country but the ruling parties 
reacted to the document with reservations, making it impossible 
to continue the dialogue." That, it said, "convinced the 
opposition's National Bloc parties that the dialogue was not 
serious and was futile, and this made them withdraw from 
arguments which benefit nobody in these exceptional 
circumstances." 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning minister and member of 
the GPC Political Bureau, said in reply that "they should let 
their conscience be the judge as to who obstructed the 
dialogue." He emphasized that the GPC did not postpone a single 
session or reject any proposal made during the committee's work 
since 8 November. 
  'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, member of the GPC Political Bureau 
and head of its General Department, has described the 
opposition's withdrawal and statement as "some kind of political 
upstaging" and accused the YSP of "using them [the opposition] 
to abort the dialogue." 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he said that "the real 
identity of the opposition is now clear. It is just the other 
face of the YSP. It hastily withdrew for reasons of political 
gain and media blackmail." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Paris, Jan 12 (AFP) -- Yasir 'Arafat is pressing on 
with democratisation of his Palestine Liberation Organisation 
and is taking account of demands for greater delegation of 
authority ahead of autonomy for Jericho and Gaza, a PLO official 
said here on Wednesday [12 January]. 
  PLO representative in France Layla Shahid said 'Arafat was 
breaking out of his "personalised style" and taking account of 
demands for democracy and greater accountability in nominations 
being made in the runup to autonomy. 
  "I think that surely in the coming months all these requests 
for more delegation of authority to others will have to be be 
taken into consideration," Shahid told members of the 
Anglo-American Press Association here. 
  She said this was already evident in nominations to the 
Palestinian Economic Reconstruction and Development Agency 
(PECDA) established to channel funds to the autonomous areas 
when negotiations with the Israelis on autonomy have been 
completed. 
  Donor countries have pledged two billion dollars in aid over 
the next five years, 580 million of it this year, to Jericho and 
Gaza, and accountability and openness were essential to avert 
the threat of corruption, Shahid said. 
  She added that planned elections would bring "major changes 
to the PLO's nature that will ultimately lead to a full 
parliament" taking over from the Palestinian National Council. 
  Shahid said the democratic debate was taking place 
world-wide 
through petitions or in the Arab press because for the moment 
the PLO had no institutions and no capital. It was vital to 
"strengthen the beginning of this process of democratisation," 
she said. "All this part of the internal debate I find very 
healthy." 
  She said PECDA, whose task will be to fund basic 
infrastructure, would be able to start functioning on the ground 
by next month. 
  A Palestinian delegation led by Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi went to 
PLO headquarters in Tunis on January 2 to press for greater 
democracy, but said they failed in their mission. 'Arafat had 
agreed to meet the delegation after receiving petitions 
demanding change. 
  Shahid said that economic autonomy talks being held here 
between Israel and the PLO would resume on January 18 and would 
be boosted by last week's monetary accord between the PLO and 
Jordan. A new meeting of donor countries under World Bank 
auspices would be held at the end of the month. 
  The PLO representative said she hoped U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's meeting in Geneva next Sunday with Syrian head of 
state Hafiz al-Asad would lead to an early resumption of 
bilateral negotiations between Israel and Syria on the Golan 
Heights.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif, Yasir 'Arafat's </F>
adviser, by Mira Avrekh in Paris "this week"] 
  [Text] "'Arafat has no choice. He must first prove to the 
Palestinians that the step he is taking serves their national 
interests. Only after he succeeds in doing that will he be able 
to reduce the influence of his opposition, of the opponents of 
peace. I think his current obstinacy is a mistake, but so is the 
big fuss the Israelis are making over petty issues." 
  The speaker is Bassam Abu-Sharif, Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, 
who has long been at the PLO leader's side. "The problem is not 
'Arafat," he told me this week in a meeting in Paris. "The 
problem is that the Palestinian negotiators give the Israeli 
representatives the impression that what they agree on is final, 
and they fail to explain to them that they do not have the final 
say and that they must get the approval of the PLO leadership. 
  "True, 'Arafat is in charge of implementation, but he can 
act 
only according to the decisions of the PLO Executive. 'Arafat 
must comply with the PLO constitution, just as Yitzhaq Rabin is 
accountable to Israeli law. 
  "In my opinion, neither 'Arafat nor Rabin are to blame. Each 
of them is entitled to see and explain the problem his own way. 
Let me give you an example: The Oslo agreement refers to 
`Jericho'; not `the city of Jericho,' but just plain `Jericho.' 
'Arafat reads this as the Jericho area, while Rabin takes it to 
mean the city of Jericho." 
  [Avrekh] "If so, what is the solution?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "Seeing that both the Israelis and the 
Palestinians decided on peace, I do not think time should be 
wasted on minor issues." 
  [Avrekh] "How would you settle it?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "Personally, the problem of the autonomous area 
of Jericho is completely marginal, I would even say irrational. 
After all, we decided in principle that Israel will get out of 
the area in exchange for a far bigger goal -- that is, a Middle 
East common market." [end Abu-Sharif] 
  I met with Abu-Sharif in a small apartment, put at his 
disposal by a friend, on the 19th floor of a building 
overlooking the Seine and the Eiffel Tower. Abu-Sharif is 
recovering from an ear operation to restore the hearing 
faculties he lost about 20 years ago when a package sent to him 
blew up in his hands. At that time, he was considered a senior 
Fatah terrorist, and it is assumed that the parcel was sent to 
him by the Israeli Mosad. This man, whose face was disfigured, 
nevertheless went on to become an ardent "dove." 
  The door of the apartment was opened carefully, just a few 
centimeters, by a blond French security officer with a 
walkie-talkie in his hand. Next to him was another Frenchman 
armed with a gun. Two other French security men were inside the 
apartment. The French Government sees to Abu-Sharif's security 
during his stay. Whenever he leaves the apartment, his 
entourage includes two cars, both of them carrying French 
bodyguards. 
  The lounge is filled with smoke. There are large ashtrays 
and glasses of whiskey on the tables, and dozens of well-wishers 
calling on him after his operation: Palestinians; Lebanese 
working for UNESCO; a Jordanian guy who came especially from 
Amman; a rich Saudi who is a close friend of multimillionaire 
Adnan Khashoggi; many Frenchmen, such as the adviser of the 
mayor of Paris who returned that very same day from a visit to 
Syria and Iraq. As soon as I was introduced as an Israeli 
journalist, everybody wanted to talk and to exchange views about 
the Israel-PLO peace process. 
  The phone rang continuously: Tunis, New York, Frankfurt, and 
again Tunis; the president of Yemen wants to speak to 
Abu-Sharif; then it is Madrid, Rome. Suddenly, a female friend 
calls out: "Bassam, it is Tunis on the line! The president 
wants you!" Abu-Sharif immerses himself in a long talk with 
'Arafat. 
  [Avrekh] "Some say you are `out,' that you are no longer 
part of 'Arafat's closest circle." 
  [Abu-Sharif] "Nonsense! He asked me to pack my things and 
accompany him to Jericho. I asked him whether he would like me 
to leave before him in order to prepare the ground for his 
arrival. He replied: `No, I want you by my side when it is 
time to go'." 
  [Avrekh] "If so, where did the rumors come from?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "Neither I nor my friends can be out. We are 
the founders. I am never far from the center of action, and 
that will also be the case in the future." 
  [Avrekh] "Why did 'Arafat not take you along to the signing 
ceremony in Washington?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "It was beneath me to ask. My job is to 
promote the process of peace negotiations, and that is far more 
important than attending ceremonies. In the future, too, my 
duties will keep me away from ceremonies. After all, it is a 
known fact that I was the first Palestinian who pushed for 
negotiations with Israel. I have been the key figure pushing 
for such negotiations since 1988." [end Abu-Sharif] 
  One may quite safely assume that Abu-Sharif harbors a 
certain 
amount of resentment toward 'Arafat, who failed to send him to 
Oslo as one of his representatives, take him to the ceremony in 
Washington, or give him a job on the negotiating delegation. If 
such resentment exists, however, Abu-Sharif goes to great 
lengths now to show it in any way. 
  [Avrekh] "How big is the camp within the PLO that supports 
you and your views?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "A camp? There is no defined camp. We are the 
mainstream of the PLO. There are thousands who agree with me, 
and I am not necessarily talking about PLO members; I am talking 
about academics, technocrats, young and talented Palestinians. 
They are all in favor of peace. They are fed up with the 
bloodshed, just as Israelis are. They are eagerly waiting 
elections in the territories." 
  [Avrekh] "What do you think should be the next step in the 
process?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "What is most important now is to establish 
institutions, to determine economic plans and form economic 
institutions manned by talented Palestinians. We have thousands 
of such youngsters, university graduates. Unfortunately, there 
is a serious dispute in our ranks over this issue. Some PLO 
leaders do not realize that if they fail to include high-caliber 
Palestinians, even if they are not members of the PLO, they will 
not be able to make progress. They must realize that the PLO is 
an organization, while the Palestinians are a people. 
  "It is important not to waste time and energy on petty 
quarrels, on a meter here or there, and focus on strategic goals 
-- namely, the solidification of economic cooperation in the 
entire region. I am talking about a common market made up of 
Israel, the Palestinians, and the other Arab states." 
  [Avrekh] "But the fact remains that the PLO has not yet 
presented any plans or set up economic cooperation institutions 
in the territories. Has 'Arafat drafted any economic plan?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "In my opinion, one of the mistakes of the PLO 
is that it is having a hard time moving from revolution to 
statehood. There is an enormous difference between an 
organization and a country. Ben-Gurion, too, was forced to 
abolish prestate underground organizations such as the Irgun and 
the Palmah, because he knew it would be impossible to found a 
state with so many political movements." 
  [Avrekh] "What is the main obstacle to progress in the peace 
process?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "I am sorry to say that many people, both Arabs 
and Israelis, do not see the situation clearly. Only a few have 
the necessary vision. Shim'on Peres is an example of a man with 
such vision, and there are also a few Palestinians; however, the 
lack of vision of many people is what is causing problems in the 
negotiations." 
  [Avrekh] "Does 'Arafat realize that he might `miss the 
train'?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "The peace process will not stop. When all is 
said and done, both we and the Israelis want to promote it. 
Nonetheless, the Israelis must realize that the Palestinians are 
Israel's bridge to the Middle East, while the Palestinians must 
see that the political plan they yearn for can only be attained 
through cooperation with Israel. Three-sided cooperation is 
needed at this stage between Israel, Jordan, and the 
Palestinians. This will constitute the first step toward a 
Middle East common market." 
  [Avrekh] "But does 'Arafat understand that through his 
behavior over the past few weeks he has been sabotaging the 
chances of realizing the ideas you have just described?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "Peace and its implementation can no longer be 
killed by anybody. Whoever tries to do so will disappear. 
'Arafat knows that very well. After all, he had the courage to 
step forward and extend his hand to Rabin." 
  [Avrekh] "You have stressed the importance of economic 
cooperation several times. I have heard that you are now doing 
business with Adnan Khashoggi. Is that true?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "Let me tell you something funny. I first met 
Khashoggi here in Paris. I was staying in a hotel that has 
three suites: Khashoggi was in one, I was in another, and 
Ari'el Sharon was in the third. Khashoggi conducted 'shuttle 
trips' between Sharon's suite and mine in a bid to attain 
negotiations about Gaza. Sharon was prepared to give the Gaza 
Strip to the Palestinians, but the PLO would not agree to an 
arrangement that included only Gaza, which Sharon insisted on 
seeing as the final solution. Nothing came of it. 
  "I have since met with Khashoggi on a number of occasions, 
all of them at President 'Arafat's instructions and never for 
private business. For example, I met with him shortly before 
the Gulf war. He was running back and forth between Saudi Arabia 
and Iraq in an attempt to prevent the war." 
  [Avrekh] "Does everybody in the PLO agree with 'Arafat's 
moves?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "As is known, the PLO is made up of various 
organizations. Each one of them, however big or small, is 
independent. The largest and strongest of them is Fatah, which 
has a huge majority in the PLO. That is why any internal 
argument in Fatah automatically becomes a PLO problem. 
  "Yes, everybody accepts the plan in principle, but there are 
differences about the implementation, just as there are 
arguments between Rabin and his cabinet ministers. That is 
legitimate. 
  "There have always been differences within the Fatah 
leadership. The point is that when such conflicts break out at a 
time of delicate political negotiations, they stand out more 
than they ordinarily would. At the same time, it is clear to 
all that 'Arafat is the indisputable leader of Fatah. To wit, 
although the last Fatah congress passed a resolution to the 
effect that everybody should compete for his position, it was 
unanimously decided that 'Arafat would not have to compete and 
would remain the No. 1 man." 
  [Avrekh] "Somebody told me that Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] 
was five votes short of reelection and almost did not make it. 
Suddenly there was a power outage, the computer went down, and 
'Arafat announced that Abu-Mazin had been elected. How true is 
this report?" 
  [Abu-Sharif] "If what you heard is true, 'Arafat did it 
because he supports the peace process and needs the votes of all 
those who support it, such as Abu-Mazin (laughing). But you 
should not infer from this that they always see eye to eye. 
  "Nonetheless, it proves that 'Arafat is the man who calls 
the 
shots. However you look at it, 'Arafat is the man who runs 
Fatah and the PLO. In spite of all the complications, he is the 
man who can deliver the goods, and he will do so."

  [Text] Damascus, SANA -- The secretaries general and 
representatives of the 10 Palestinian factions held a news 
conference at noon yesterday. Arab and foreign news agencies 
correspondents attended the news conference held at the 
al-Khalisah compound in al-Yarmuk camp. 
  Attending the news conference were: Comrade 'Isam al-Qadi 
al-Sa'iqah, secretary general; Abu Musa [Sa'id Musa Muragha], 
secretary of the Fatah Movement's Central Committee; Ahmad 
Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLFP-GC]; Dr. Fathi 
al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad 
Movement; Khalid 'Abd-al-Majid, secretary general of the 
Palestinian Popular Struggle Front [PPSF]; 'Arabi 'Awwad, 
secretary general of the Palestinian Revolutionary Communist 
Party [PRCP]; Abu-'Ali Mustafa, assistant secretary general of 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP]; 
Ibrahim Ghawshah, Hamas Political Bureau member and official 
spokesman; Abu-Layla [Qays al-Samarra'i], member of the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] 
Political Bureau; 'Ali 'Aziz, Palestine Liberation Front [PLF] 
Political Bureau member; and several representatives of these 
factions' commands. 
  At the start of the news conference, the formation of the 
Alliance of Palestinian forces comprising the 10 Palestinian 
factions was announced. 
  A statement in the name of the alliance was then read. The 
statement stresses the need to abide by the Palestinian National 
Charter, and the Palestinian people's inalienable national 
rights to Palestine, their homeland, and to repatriation, 
self-determination, and complete national independence. The 
statement also emphasizes that the Palestinian cause is an Arab 
and Islamic cause and that the liberation of Palestine is the 
responsibility of the Arab and Islamic nation, most of all the 
Palestinian people. 
  The statement stresses the importance of the Palestinian 
people's unity, territorial integrity, and the unity of their 
cause, objectives, and national fate, and the abidance by all 
their national and historical rights. The statement says that 
no one has the right to give up any of these rights, and views 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement as not binding for the Palestinian 
people. The statement calls for clinging to Palestine as an 
irreplaceable historical homeland for the Palestinian people, 
and for opposing all the schemes for a substitute homeland, 
resettlement, transfer, compensation, or attempts to obliterate 
the Palestinian people's national identity. 
  In its statement, the alliance calls for continuing 
intifadah activities. It emphasizes that the Palestine question 
is the core of the Arab-Zionist conflict, and stresses the need 
for bolstering joint Palestinian militant ties. 
  The statement emphasizes the right of the Palestinian people 
in the diaspora to exercise their militant responsibilities 
alongside the nationalist, Arab, and Islamic forces to promote 
liberation, return, self-determination, and full national 
independence. 
  The statement calls for stepping up cooperation with the 
Islamic, Asian, and African states as well as with all the 
friendly nations standing by the struggle of our Palestinian 
people and supporting their inalienable national rights. It 
emphasizes the importance of forging an alliance with all the 
forces for liberation and progress around the world--the forces 
that support our national rights. 
  The statement calls for work to disseminate all that relates 
to the Palestinian cause and the national struggle to win the 
widest public opinion over to the cause of our struggle and 
rights, and to make the case that Gaza-Jericho agreement neither 
amounts to a solution nor brings peace. 
  The statement says the alliance will form a Central Command, 
which will be responsible for formulating its decisions and 
policies that are based on the alliance's political tasks. 
  The Central Command will include two representatives of each 
faction, while its secretariat will include one representative 
of each faction. 
  The Alliance of Palestinian forces groups the following 
factions: The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas; the PFLP-GC; 
the Palestinian National Liberation Movement, Fatah; the PFLP; 
the DFLP; al-Sa'iqah Organization; the PPSF; the Palestinian 
Islamic Jihad Movement, the the PRCP; and the PLF. 
  The secretaries general then answered questions posed by 
journalists on issues relating to the situation in the 
Palestinian arena.

  [Text] Abu-Dhabi, 13 Jan (MENA)--AL-ITTIHAD today cites 
Arab diplomatic sources in London as saying that the latest 
confessions by 'Adnan Yasin, a Palestinian official accused of 
spying for Israel, reveal that he foiled a Palestinian attempt 
to assassinate former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Shamir two 
years ago. 
  The sources said Yasin told the Mosad about an Israeli man 
recruited by the PLO agencies to assassinate Shamir after 
arranging a secret visit to Tunis for the Israeli, who was 
arrested immediately after he returned to Tel Aviv.

  [Text] Thirteen days before the opening of the national 
dialogue conference, initiatives and statements calling for 
optimism are being made to ease the situation and raise people's 
hopes. 
  Following the encouraging measures, particularly in the 
security sphere, that the spokesman of the National Dialogue 
Commission revealed yesterday, four parties submitted a document 
to the Higher State Council [HCE] and the National Dialogue 
Commission [NDC]. This document includes measures to ensure the 
success of the national dialogue. Mahfoud Mannan has the 
details: 
  [Mannan] Today, the national radio received a copy of a 
document signed by four political parties: the National 
Liberation Front [FLN], the Movement for Democracy in Algeria, 
HAMAS, and al-Nahdah. 
  The document contains supporting measures to ensure the 
success of the national dialogue. The aforementioned parties 
addressed it to the HCE and the NDC. 
  The document includes 14 measures, among which are: adopting 
measures for the benefit of the leading members of the Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS] to allow them to participate in making the 
national dialogue successful; closing the security centers and 
releasing people under administrative detention who have no 
charges against them or have been sentenced for their opinions; 
easing the security measures ensuing from the state of emergency 
to pave the way for lifting them; abolishing the restrictions 
imposed on political activity; suspending the work of the 
special courts to pave the way for the abolition of emergency 
courts and laws; ceasing raids and different types of 
infringement; investigating torture crimes; respecting the 
freedom of the press; return of the suspended newspapers; and 
putting an end to the harassment against journalists on account 
of their opinion. 
  A short while ago, colleague Chaabane Ouleki talked on the 
phone with al-Nahdah Movement leader Shaykh Djaballah and asked 
him about the content of this document. 
  [Begin recording] [Djaballah] We submitted the document with 
a sincere desire to provide a suitable atmosphere and the 
necessary conditions for the success of the national dialogue. 
We therefore believe that solutions to the crises the country 
is experiencing must be found only through national dialogue. 
But we see that the dialogue is still at an impasse. Thus, we 
have been pressing since the start of the national dialogue, not 
only from today, from the first meeting with the HCE and in the 
different meetings, for the need to adopt measures to help the 
national dialogue succeed and to restore the people's peace of 
mind. What the NDC announced yesterday represents the first 
useful and encouraging steps, but these are insufficient. 
  [Ouleki] Mr. Djaballah, you said the dialogue was still at 
an 
impasse, but we have noticed that the sides that took part in 
putting forward this issue, also participated in the meetings 
with the NDC and put forward these demands. Have you discussed 
among yourselves the issue of participating or not participating 
in the national dialogue conference, because we are a few days 
away from it? 
  [Djaballah] We were extremely frank in our last meeting with 
the NDC. In principle, we rejected the pilot study proposed by 
the NDC and rejected it for objective and extremely precise 
reasons. We have presented our point of view verbally and also 
presented it in writing. 
  [Ouleki] You say that the dialogue has reached a dead end, 
but if we read some of the demands mentioned in the platform, 
they are nearly either about to be implemented or included in 
the preliminary text of the study; for instance, the 
cancellation of restrictions on political activity, easing the 
security measures, respecting the citizen's basic rights and 
general freedom, and respecting the nation's feelings in the 
mass media. These ideas, or the spirit of these points, are 
almost available in the pilot study and could have been 
addressed in more detail either before or after the conference. 
  [Djaballah] Yes. In truth, there are positive issues, but 
they are insufficient in our opinion; for instance, of the 
negative issues present in the pilot study presented by the NDC, 
I can mention that an agreement was reached with the NDC to 
exclude the discussion of the program for society [political 
program on the nature of the regime to be established], but it 
was noticed today that the document they presented has dealt 
with the most important constituents of the program for society 
through what has been mentioned in the preamble, aims, and 
guarantees. We could mention numerous examples to support this 
but it would take too long. For instance, it was noticed that 
the study did not aim at dealing with the situation in the 
country as much as solving the problems faced by the current 
authorities. This is in complete contradiction with what has 
been agreed on regarding the need to direct all efforts to solve 
Algeria's crises. For example, the study dealt with numerous 
issues in general and abstract terms, a matter that caused great 
confusion on the implicit meanings. This is bound to open the 
door wide for different interpretations and bad explanations now 
and in the future. 
  [Ouleki] But Mr. Djaballah, even in political activity, if 
each side puts forward its own conditions on the basis of which 
it decides whether to participate or not, is it easy and simple 
to satisfy all the conditions, even though they might be 
contradictory, divergent, or (?incoherent), if there were no 
reciprocal concessions by the sides to the dialogue? 
  [Djaballah] This is a valid question. This is why we have 
made a distinction between the administrative and technical 
issues and those connected with the nature of the important 
political choices. We said that issues of an administrative and 
technical nature could be settled by voting. As for the issues 
dealing with important political choices, they should be 
avoided. We called for avoiding these type of issues because it 
would be difficult to reach a firm decision for two main 
reasons, the first of which is the difficulty of the subject, 
and the second is the brevity of the period and the difficulty 
of the circumstances. Thus, I think that if the study 
restricted itself to the issues of an administrative and 
technical nature, the chances of its success would be greater. 
This is what we wish. 
  [Ouleki] Mr. Djaballah, will the parties that signed the 
platform document participate collectively or be absent 
collectively in the conference, or is the issue of participating 
or abstaining from the conference a matter that concerns each 
party? Have you discussed this issue or this possibility? 
  [Djaballah] We have not discussed this issue until now. I 
think that the issue concerns each party. I think that. 
  [Ouleki] In other words, irrespective of the response to the 
demands present in the platform? 
  [Djaballah] I think that the issue concerns each party. [end 
recording]

  [Excerpts] The National Dialogue Commission [NDC] is 
concluding its multilateral talks with political formations in 
preparation for the convening of the national conference at the 
scheduled date. Jaouida Khaia reports: 
  [Khaia] During the last round of its multilateral talks with 
the dialogue partners which began 5 January, the NDC received 37 
political parties and 27 social associations and organizations. 
Nine small parties did not attend the meetings for undisclosed 
reasons although some of them offered official apologies, 
according to sources close to the NDC. The National Liberation 
Front [FLN] was also absent from the dialogue meeting for the 
first time. [passage omitted] 
  It is to be noted that HAMAS [Islamic Society Movement] is 
the only party which has officially announced that it will 
participate in the national conference. It is expected that the 
position of the other parties will become clear next week after 
a meeting of the leading bodies of the al-Nahdah Islamic 
Movement, the Rally for Culture and Democracy, the FLN, and the 
Movement for Democracy in Algeria.

  [Excerpts] President Husni Mubarak, leader of the National 
Democratic Party [NDP], has chaired a meeting for the party's 
General Secretariat at the presidential palace. [passage 
omitted] 
  After the meeting, Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif 
noted that this was the first meeting chaired by President 
Mubarak after forming the new Secretariat. He said the NDP has 
now formed all its leaderships and structures. 
  Al-Sharif said that President Mubarak discussed party and 
national work at this stage and in the future, touching on 
several basic issues such as economy, economic reforms and the 
progress made therein, and the side-effects of the economic 
reform policy. The president also dealt with a number of 
political issues, notably national dialogue, democratic 
practice, confronting terrorism, and the role of the NDP in 
creating a climate for political and economic reforms and 
addressing people's daily concerns. [passage omitted] 
  The information minister said President Mubarak pointed out 
that the economic situation looms as the most important issue 
for society. Addressing that issue and creating an appropriate 
living standard for society is not possible without a sound 
economy that takes into consideration population growth, the 
president said. 
  Mubarak reviewed the developments of the economic crisis 
that 
face Egypt and explained the stages of the economic reforms. He 
noted that the reforms and their progress are not isolated from 
Egypt's internal and foreign policies. They were linked, he 
said, to Egypt's ability to restore its Arab and international 
status, to capitalize on its international relations, and to 
deal and interact with the issues of the region. He said this 
ability largely helped achieve international backing for Egypt's 
economy and cancellation of Egypt's debts. The president 
pointed out that the debts that were written off were equal in 
value to Egypt's investments in the rebuilding of the 
infrastructure during the first and second development plans. 
[passage omitted] 
  Minister al-Sharif said President Mubarak pointed out the 
phenomenon of terrorism, which aims to harm Egypt's achievements 
and the interests of the people. The president stressed his 
eagerness to serve citizens' interests and ensure security and 
safety for all Egyptians, noting that all Egyptians reject 
terrorism. President Mubarak also discussed the role of the NDP 
in political and social work to strengthen society and mobilize 
its forces to confront terrorism, expose its false allegations, 
and protect youths from sliding into wrong notions. [passage 
omitted] 
  On the national dialogue, President Mubarak said his call 
for 
a dialogue proceeds from the public interest and from a desire 
to preserve Egypt and the future of its sons. He said he hoped 
the dialogue will be objective, honest, and devoid of any 
maneuvers or one-upmanship by any party. [passage omitted] 
  On foreign policy, President Mubarak discussed Egypt's Arab 
relations, noting that they are good with all the brothers. He 
said relations are strong and firm with the Custodian of the Two 
Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz of Saudi Arabia; His 
Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan, president of the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE]; and Sultan Qabus of Oman. The president noted 
cooperation with the leadership, government, and people of Saudi 
Arabia, and he also noted strong firm relations with Oman, the 
UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain. 
  The president said the priority is now to achieve Arab 
reconciliation, and he noted the importance of Arab cooperation 
and coordination in facing challenges. President Mubarak said 
that despite differences, Egypt is against any attempt to harm 
the territorial integrity of Iraq or Sudan, and is against 
fragmentation and struggle in Yemen. He said Egypt is working 
with Africa to solve the deteriorating situation in Somalia. On 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mubarak said what the people there are 
facing can be described as an international scandal. 
  The information minister said that President Mubarak 
explained Egypt's role in the Middle East and its attempts to 
bring viewpoints closer, whether in the meeting between Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton, in 
overcoming the obstacles facing the Palestinian-Israeli 
negotiations, or in moves concerning southern Lebanon. The 
president noted that the road is still long and needs 
determination without relinquishment of rights. He also noted 
Egypt's efforts to solve the Libyan-Western crisis and said that 
Egypt interacts with the international community while 
preserving Egyptian dignity and appreciating the country's 
weight and culture. He said Egypt knows its Arab role as a 
backer of the brothers, its African role in defending the causes 
of the continent, and its Islamic role as an influential country.

<F P=106> ['Atif 'Umar commentary: "The Syrian Cards in the Upcoming </F>
al-Asad-Clinton Summit"] 
  [Text] The eyes of the Arab region are turned toward the 
upcoming meeting in Geneva Sunday between Presidents al-Asad and 
Clinton. The meeting comes while the world is watching the 
developments of the Middle East, which sees calm at times and 
tension at others. Since the convening of the Madrid 
conference, movements toward peace in the Middle East have taken 
on new dimensions that finally resulted in the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement, which was signed at the White 
House amid international welcome, U.S. support, and Arab 
backing. All Arab countries showed an eagerness for a just and 
lasting peace based on a land-for-peace exchange and recognition 
of the legitimate Palestinian rights as stated in the successive 
UN resolutions. 
  That President Clinton fixed his meeting with President 
al-Asad after contacts and consultations by the U.S. secretary 
of state in the Syrian capital means that there are far more 
points of agreement between Washington and Damascus over Middle 
East issues than differences. If that was not the case, what 
would the meeting and the talks be for? 
  Through its contacts and watch of the region's developments, 
the United States realizes that peace in the region cannot be 
achieved without Egypt and Syria. Now that things have settled 
down between Egypt and Israel since the signing of the Camp 
David agreement, and the two sides have seen the positive 
economic, political, and even social results of the peace 
process, this successful experiment can be repeated on the 
Syrian front. But the Israelis need to realize that the 
continuation of the current situation will have serious 
implications. The opponents of peace agreements with Israel use 
this situation to support their rejectionist positions, and any 
delay in reaching a genuine peace between the Arabs and Israel 
would encourage the Israeli parties and individuals that reject 
peace agreements with the Arabs, especially since a state of 
anxiety and tension still prevails in Israel due to the violence 
and counterviolence between Jewish settlers and Palestinians. 
  The upcoming meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton 
may prompt a serious call for a comprehensive peace in the 
Middle East. Among his cards at the talks, the Syrian president 
carries unlimited Arab support for reaching a just and 
comprehensive peace in the region. He also has Saudi support 
and blessings for reaching a just solution to the Jerusalem 
problem. And above all, Syria has special relations with 
Lebanon, which in turn enjoys special relations with the West 
and the United States, especially since Lebanon has never been 
involved in any hostile acts against any of its neighbors. 
  We stress that the U.S. Administration, out of its eagerness 
to promote the Middle East peace process and to achieve 
security, stability, and peace in the region, will give these 
factors due consideration and, consequently, push the 
Syrian-Israeli track toward serious negotiations to achieve this 
peace, which all peoples of the region, including the Israeli 
people, aspire to. The Israeli people reject isolation and 
demand normalization of relations and the lifting of the trade 
boycott. These are vital matters for the Israelis, but as the 
Arab League has announced, they are linked to a full Israeli 
withdrawal to the 1967 border and to exchanging land for peace.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhmud Bikri] </F>
  [Text] In a serious violation of Egyptian sovereignty, 
members of the U.S. Embassy last week inspected oil equipment in 
Alexandria and the Red Sea that the government has recently 
imported. They claim that the Egyptian Government has shipped 
to the Libyan Jamahiriyah imported oil equipment worth more than 
$75 million. 
  The U.S. action caused displeasure in several Egyptian 
circles, which confirmed reports in this regard. They 
emphasized that the U.S. Embassy's inspection of some oil and 
other industrial equipment is unacceptable and constitutes a 
violation of Egyptian sovereignty. 
  The United States has threatened to suspend some deals, 
including deals involving oil equipment, already concluded with 
the Egyptian Government. It has also threatened to impose 
economic sanctions against Egypt following U.S. reports that 
Egypt has allegedly violated the UN economic sanctions against 
Libya. The United States claims that various U.S. agencies have 
detected about 560 Egyptian violations of the UN economic 
sanctions against Libya. It also claims that there are existing 
trade exchanges between the two countries, that large quantities 
of Egyptian-made and imported products go to Libya, and that 
about 800 Egyptian businessmen have visited Libya and about 
1,500 Libyan businessmen visited Egypt to promote trade between 
the two countries. 
  In light of this, the U.S. State Department has asked the 
U.S. Embassy in Cairo to check on the extent of the Egyptian 
Government's adherence to the economic sanctions against Libya 
and to file a weekly report on the matter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General Engineer Muhammad al-Ghamrawi, </F>
minister of state for war production, by Jamal Kamal; place and 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Kamal] Why is there interest in developing and 
enhancing the war industry when Egypt, the region, and the world 
are embarking on a new stage of peace in which certain 
restrictions are being imposed to control armaments and 
producing countries that monopolize on weapons production are 
calling for restrictions on the transfer of arms production 
technology? 
  [Al-Ghamrawi] I have been asked these questions many times, 
even by people working in war production. I always answered 
with another question: Why should the Armed Forces be 
maintained and why should there be a constant call for 
developing and upgrading these forces? 
  If peace is the goal a state seeks to achieve and maintain 
to 
curb political and military tension and therefore provide more 
favorable conditions for best use of its resources to enhance 
the state's strength and enable it to continue its march toward 
progress, there must be a power to protect that peace. A 
general rule in the military, though, says that if you want 
peace you should be ready for war. Whoever advocates peace and 
tries to protect it through his own weakness would be signing 
his own death warrant. It is wrong to think that peace means 
doing away with or reducing the numbers of the armed forces 
because they are no longer needed for pursuing the state's 
national interests. The truth is that the lack of power makes 
the state a prey for ambitious persons and vulnerable to various 
risks at all times. This creates domestic instability and 
directly affects development plans. [passage omitted] 
  [Kamal] But there are international calls to control 
armaments and curb the expansion of war production. Steps have 
actually been taken to prevent the export of arms production 
technology. 
  [Al-Ghamrawi] What is being said about controlling armaments 
or curbing expansion in military production is meant to make the 
various forms of war production exclusive to a group of states 
that monopolize it and control its prices. 
  The best evidence of this can be found in the fact that the 
major states' arms exports to the Third World in two years alone 
exceeded arms exports for 10 years. Besides, what does armament 
control have to do with developing your military industry, if 
your goal is to satisfy the needs of your Armed Forces and 
develop the equipment they already have? Developing the 
military industry does not mean exporting it or trading in it in 
a way that undermines stability. [passage omitted] 
  [Kamal] What is the major goal behind the development of the 
Egyptian military industry? 
  [Al-Ghamrawi] The goal is to enhance the ties between the 
Ministry of War Production and the Ministry of Defense, which is 
the main user of military products. In other words, we want to 
provide for the needs of the Armed Forces and to link our plan 
for production to the Armed Forces' armament plan. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Kamal] How can Egyptian military production be developed 
while there are restrictions on the transfer of arms production 
technology? 
  [Al-Ghamrawi] This is an important issue that forms a large 
part of the new development strategy. This strategy is based on 
a new reading of the actual situation and on developing a new 
vision to cope with that situation. 
  Egypt's moderate policy and its belief in mutual interests 
and interrelation has helped it acquire many technologies 
without fear of abusing them. Egypt succeeded in acquiring the 
latest technologies from the United States, France, and some 
East European states. Our moderation provides us with the 
needed grounds to obtain what we want. 
  As for our vision, it is based on two main factors: 
  1. To utilize what we already have. 
  2. To develop and update what we already have and conduct 
further research. [passage omitted] 
  [Kamal] What are the markets for Egyptian weapons under the 
current international competition? 
  [Al-Ghamrawi] The Arab and African states. I think that with 
some political effort we can find the best marketing formula so 
that the revenue can be spent on developing the weapons. 
  [Kamal] Do you think it is possible in the current situation 
in the Arab world to establish an Arab military industry? 
  [Al-Ghamrawi] I still believe that Arab states have many 
capabilities to cooperate in military industry without fear. We 
are capable of entering the sphere of military production with 
products that meet international levels. 
  [Kamal] Why do foreign papers attack the M-1 tank factory 
every now and then? 
  [Al-Ghamrawi] The Egyptian factory for the production and 
repair of armored vehicles -- which began with the production of 
the U.S. M-1 tank -- was a considerable addition to the power of 
Egyptian military production. It is one of the most modern 
military factories built in the world recently. Military 
industries are always questioned and are subjected to attacks 
every now and then. It seems that Egypt's and its workers' 
success in building the factory and absorbing the tank 
manufacturing technology, the peak of military technologies, 
frightens some people. But we will go on with the project 
according to plan. 
  [Kamal] But the project will be completed in 1997. Does this 
mean that the production license will be withdrawn and the 
factory closed? 
  [Al-Ghamrawi] There is no such thing as withdrawing a 
production license. The hypothetical shelf life of the tank is 
20 to 25 years. Tanks in general need overhauls, maintenance, 
and development. The M-1 tank we are manufacturing is only a 
developed version of the M-60-A-3. There is also the M-1-A-2. 
Moreover, can anyone take back from you the technology you have 
learned? 
  We started the overhauling of the M-60-A-3 in the factory 
and 
we will start the overhauling of the M-1. We are studying how 
to meet new demands. A joint study is under way with the Armed 
Forces to select an armored combat vehicle to be manufactured in 
the factory. 
  [Kamal] Since the 122-mm and 130-mm guns were manufactured, 
the Egyptian artillery factory has not produced new pieces of 
artillery. Why? 
  [Al-Ghamrawi] We obtained a license to manufacture the 
120-mm 
barrel of the M-1 tank in the artillery factory. This is one of 
the latest technologies in the world and it is different from 
that of ordinary artillery. There is also a project to produce 
the strategic steel needed for the artillery industry in the 
factory. 
  [Kamal] Some foreign newspapers once in a while report that 
Egypt is producing chemical weapons. 
  [Al-Ghamrawi] We have an established and unchanging 
principle: We do not manufacture any type of chemical weapons. 
We only manufacture the equipment needed to protect ourselves 
against these weapons. 
  [Kamal] Some people talk about the need to privatize 
military 
production. 
  [Al-Ghamrawi] Privatizing the war industry is out of the 
question. Like the Armed Forces, war production is one of the 
elements of Egyptian power and national security. If it is not 
possible to buy security from any state, then war production 
cannot be sold. Privatization is unsuitable for war production.

<F P=106> [Article by Mustafa Mashhur] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Muslims in some of our Arab 
and Islamic countries have been afflicted with tyrannical 
regimes that control the people's fate in varying degrees. Some 
regimes permit relative, limited, freedom, others ban political 
parties, and others place restrictions and obstacles in the way 
of parties getting permission to operate. They allow parties 
that have no popular base and don't allow those that have a 
large popular base so that they can say they are applying 
democracy and allowing a multitude of parties. Some regimes 
interfere with legislative elections in favor of the ruling 
party. Some regimes might also appoint legislative councils. 
Some regimes control the official media--radio, television, 
newspapers, and magazines--and spend the people's money on them 
so that they will serve as their instruments. They draft laws 
restricting the freedom to publish newspapers. They also draft 
emergency laws restricting public freedom and prompting youths 
to go underground and violate the law. Such activity is met 
with counterviolence, which does not help solve the problem; it 
escalates it. We see this clearly in Algeria and Egypt. 
Indiscriminate arrests also help to increase the number of 
rebels and the bloodshed on both sides. 
  Such cases of instability prevent an atmosphere of security 
for achieving reform and development from being established. 
They also provide the opportunity to outside forces to carry 
out activities and attribute them to citizens, because the 
continuing instability serves the interest of these foreign 
forces. 
  Our advice to such regimes--if they are sincere in seeking 
their countries' good--is to free up public liberties, such as 
the freedom to form parties, the freedom of the press, and the 
freedom to hold conferences and symposiums. These regimes must 
ensure the honesty of elections so that a government 
representing the majority of the people can be formed and the 
freely elected state institutions can carry out their 
responsibilities and duties to achieve a good and honorable life 
for their peoples and solve every problem and crisis. Free 
elections separate the good from the bad. 
  Much argument has raged about the dialogue, its motives, who 
should participate in it, the issues it should deal with, the 
issues that should take priority, and the conclusion that should 
be reached. Much doubt has been cast on the seriousness of the 
dialogue. The situation in society is worsening, reaching a 
point where it is almost intolerable. A solution must be found. 
There are many political, economic, security, and foreign 
problems and they must not remain unsolved. The ruling regime 
was supposed to solve them, but it couldn't, because it has lost 
the people's confidence. If the dialogue is meant to involve 
the people in finding sound solutions to these problems, the 
correct and natural approach is to give the people their freedom 
and political rights first, such as the freedom to form parties, 
freedom of the press, and free and honest elections of 
legislative assemblies that can fulfill their responsibilities 
in solving these problems. 
  But if the dialogue's purpose is for the participants to 
come 
out with something like a charter that will bind the people, 
this is wrong, because the interlocutors are not elected by the 
people in free and honest elections that would have the people 
abide by what is achieved. 
  The Muslim Brotherhood wholeheartedly wishes that stability 
and reform might be achieved in all state sectors and that all 
problems will be solved concretely. We hope the time will come 
when everyone will be convinced that Islam is the solution, 
because it is characterized by perfection, as it comes from God, 
who is perfect. God's word is the truth and he guides us on our 
way.

  [Text] Security leaders in Asyut have warned against 
continuing the State Security Investigation Department's policy 
of storming the mosques of the Islamic Group in the Asyut 
Governorate. Group members respond by retaliating against the 
police. The latest such action was the assassination of 
Interior Ministry inspector Colonel Muhammad Tu'aymah, who was 
accused by the Islamic Group leaders of being responsible for 
storming the al-Rahmah mosque, the group stronghold in Asyut 
city. 
  The security leaders called for dialogue with the leaders of 
the Islamic Group to implement a previous agreement between the 
security services and the group not to carry out incidents in 
Asyut in return for leaving the Islamic Group to exercise its 
mission inside al-Rahmah mosque. Sources have affirmed that 
none of those accused of belonging to the military wing of the 
Islamic Group have entered the mosque. 
  The security leaders expect attacks on policemen and the 
assassination of police officers to continue as long as the 
al-Rahmah mosque remains under police control. The security 
forces have placed a strong guard around particular security 
leaders, including Brigadier General Sa'id Thabit Abu-al-Ma'ali. 
Additional measures have been adopted to guard Major General 
Majdi al-Basyuni, director of the Asyut Security Department. 
His residence near the Asyut sports club is heavily guarded and 
the house's street wall has been made higher. 
  Accusations are being exchanged between the security 
services 
and the political and popular leaders over responsibility for 
the deteriorating situation in Asyut city. The have all 
emphasized the security services' failure to deal with things.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Yisra'el Segal--live] 
  [Excerpt] [Segal] Do you have any expectations or fears 
about the upcoming meeting between Clinton and al-Asad? 
  [Peres] I think we should approach the matter with an open 
mind. It makes no sense to engage in speculations, when we will 
know exactly what happened there in another three or four days. 
My impression is that a change has occurred in Syria. It would 
be wrong to say that nothing has happened or to compare the 
current situation to the past. The main question is whether 
al-Asad has indeed drawn all the conclusions from the change he 
knows has taken place and the change he has undergone. We will 
have to wait until next Sunday [16 January] or Monday to find 
out, because President al-Asad is obviously holding his cards 
very close to his chest. 
  [Segal] What are the expectations from Israel's point of 
view? Do we expect al-Asad to declare that he wants full 
normalization? He is making this conditional on a full 
withdrawal. 
  [Peres] We expect several things which, taken together, form 
a process of peace. The first concerns the nature of the 
negotiations. They cannot be confined to one narrow track 
strewn with microphones, which turns into a futile verbal 
confrontation. Negotiations must be open and broad, and should 
include higher levels and quieter channels so they can really 
take off from where they are now. 
  Second, he must seriously and fully address the question of 
peace. After all, we are being asked tangible things, and what 
they are offering us has to do with rewards, declarations, and 
atmosphere. Furthermore, if even those offers are made 
sparingly, what is the point of the whole issue? In this 
context, al-Sadat realized that he must first go for full peace, 
including embassies.... 
  [Segal, interrupting] Mr. Peres, you mention al-Sadat. We 
know -- and who knows better than you -- that such high-level 
meetings between leaders, between a U.S. President and President 
al-Asad, do not take place unless they are preceded by thorough 
and serious work in which the essence of the meeting is in fact 
assured. 
  [Peres] I do not agree with you; there is no such rule. 
Sometimes, the meeting itself is the main event, as Secretary of 
State Christopher put it. I am not all that sure that every 
summit meeting is prepared down to the last detail. 
  [Segal] Do we have any information about the issues al-Asad 
will raise? 
  [Peres] I do not think we can have such information, and I 
believe the Syrians themselves have no such information either. 
Syria is ruled by one man. He calls the shots, and he decides 
when to announce his decisions. Therefore, any speculation is 
just that. Things may turn out one way or another. Clearly, the 
Syrians have developed very high expectations of and with regard 
to the United States. The United States has so far treaded its 
way cautiously, because it does not want to raise unfounded 
expectations. Having said that, we will have to wait and see 
what happens in a few days. 
  I would like to say something of which I am certain: Israel 
truly wants peace with Syria. Basically, we do not want a 
wounded Middle East, not even in parts of it. We want to bring 
peace to the Jews and the Arabs and to stop all the wars and 
threats once and for all. We are absolutely determined and 
resolute on this issue. If we can reach peace with Syria, we 
will be very glad. [passage omitted] 
  [In a recorded interview with Peres by Itay Engel and Tamar 
Landau on Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 13 
January, Peres is asked whether Nabil Sha'th's proposal "to 
defer negotiations on disputed issues in order to make some 
progress" is acceptable to Israel. The foreign minister 
replies: "We are trying to make progress on a very broad front. 
There are two committees, not just one, and progress should be 
made on any issue in which progress is possible. I think Nabil 
Sha'th is wrong in thinking that the agreements or 
understandings reached in Cairo no longer exist; it is a 
mistake."]

  [Text] The bilateral peace talks in Washington will resume 
on the 24th of this month, with only some of the delegation 
heads taking part. This is according to an Israeli source 
speaking to reporters in the U.S. capital yesterday. Talks with 
Palestinians will not resume until the Taba talks are concluded, 
the source said. 
  Jordan's King Husayn is to meet with President Bill Clinton 
next week, a meeting considered no less important than Clinton's 
upcoming summit with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, said the 
Israeli source. 
  The Israeli source in Washington says that Israel will not 
be 
satisfied with slogans on peace from Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad when he meets U.S. President Clinton in Geneva. The 
source told Qol Yisra'el Jerusalem expects concrete steps, in 
particular on the issue of security arrangements. 
  Intelligence sources here in Israel believe the Syrians, for 
their part, have high hopes in advance of the summit. They say 
President al-Asad's entourage will include some 100 people, as 
compared to smaller teams that accompanied him when he met in 
the past with U.S. Presidents Bush and Carter.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shulamit Aloni, Israeli "Minister of </F>
sciences and communications," by Muhammad al-Hinnawi in 
Jerusalem; date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Hinnawi] The world is astonished, actually 
shocked, by the failure to agree on the start of the Israeli 
withdrawal and the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
on 12 December. What are the reasons and what do you think is 
happening? 
  [Aloni] Let me stress at the beginning that this government 
has decided to do all it can for peace. This is our choice and 
the clock will never go backward. We are, indeed, ready to 
honor our commitments under the Gaza-Jericho first agreement. 
We want the Palestinians to lead and run their own lives in the 
self-rule territories. But the Palestinians and the world must 
know that Israel now is not speaking with one voice. We are 
divided. The government wants true peace, but it only 
represents one segment of the people. There are other segments 
who do not believe and do not want peace. They believe that God 
has given the sons of Israel this entire territory and that the 
Palestinians have no place among them. But thank God, they are 
not a majority. We are the majority, but their voice is louder. 
This is the kind of conflict we have in our society. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Very well, but what is your and your party's 
position concerning this conflict? 
  [Aloni] Our policy is clear. I agree to give up all the 
territories occupied following the 1967 war. The Palestinians 
have a right to set up their own state in the West Bank and 
Gaza, but this is not the government's viewpoint, because it 
knows that the Israelis are living in fear. Some of the fears 
are justified and some are not. For 15 years, the previous 
Likud governments continued to emphasize to the people the need 
to not trust anyone and that this justifies the occupation. 
This is the reason why the extremists brand us as traitors and 
agents of the Arabs. We suffer from Israeli extremism the same 
way you suffer from Arab extremism. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] But aren't you concerned by the eroding support 
for the peace agreement with the Palestinians and the Likud's 
sweeping victory in the municipal elections, particularly since 
some of the constituencies have been Labor strongholds for 
decades? 
  [Aloni] Actually, I am not disturbed. The erosion you are 
referring to following the signing of the agreement is natural, 
particularly with the continued confrontations in the occupied 
territories. This week, support for the agreement started to 
return to what it was the day after the agreement was signed. 
There are 148 in favor and 146 against [not further explained]. 
I expect the number of supporters to increase in the coming 
weeks. As for the Likud's victory in the municipal elections, 
this has nothing to do with the agreement. Municipal elections 
are about individuals, not policies, and in these elections the 
Israeli voter gives his vote to the person he thinks will 
provide the best services to the city or the village he lives in. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] What do you think is the real problem behind 
the 
Israeli Government's insistence on controlling the crossing 
points between Egypt and Gaza and Jordan and Gaza? What is the 
reason for shrinking the Jericho area to be given to the 
Palestinians? Don't you see that this insistence on the part of 
the government will harm the chances of peace? 
  [Aloni] The fact is that the Israeli public now cannot agree 
to leave the question of borders outside Israel's control, 
because the time is not yet ripe for this. Confidence must be 
built first. In addition, the Declaration of Principles did not 
include any reference to these points. I understand Yasir 
'Arafat's position. He wants to gain as much as he can for his 
people after all these difficult years. The Israeli Government 
is surprised every day by 'Arafat's increasing demands. The 
same is true for Jericho. Under the agreement, we agreed to 
hand over the city of Jericho and the camps around it to 
'Arafat, but now he is demanding the Jordan Valley, although the 
agreement absolutely did not mention it. No one among the 
Israelis thought of abandoning the area north of the Dead Sea 
and up to the Damya bridge during this stage. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Does your party hold that same view? 
  [Aloni] If it were up to me I would have immediately agreed 
to relinquish all the occupied Palestinian territories to the 
Palestinian people and let them establish their own state. But 
I am a member of the government and bound by their policy, 
although my views are well known. But this is what will happen 
eventually. Therefore I say to 'Arafat: Be patient just a 
little more. You have been patient for a long time and will not 
wait more than you already have. Let us proceed one step at a 
time. We have to be realistic and act according to the signed 
agreement. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] News reports, particularly those carried by 
REUTER, have said that Israel has presented to Egypt a map 
detailing the huge wealth hidden under the sands of Sinai, 
including the uranium used in making atomic bombs. As minister 
of sciences, what do you think of these reports? 
  [Aloni] Your report is correct, although it is not complete. 
We indeed presented this map to Egypt as a sign of the goodwill 
and confidence in relations between the two sides. What was not 
published was that we discovered that Egypt has a similar map 
and that it knows everything about Sinai's wealth. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] Reports say that Israel has actually reached a 
peace agreement with Jordan but it has not been announced as 
yet. What is the truth about these reports, and what is the 
latest on talks with Syria? 
  [Aloni] An initial agreement has indeed been reached with 
Jordan. There are no problems with Jordan. But King Husayn is 
waiting for progress in negotiations with Syria before he 
announces the agreement. As for Syria, I believe that we have 
reached common ground and that talks will resume very soon. We 
are willing to make everything possible to reach an agreement 
with Syria. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] What about the problem of settlements in Golan? 
  [Aloni] I admit it is a problem. It was caused by the fact 
that the previous Labor government allowed settlers to live in 
Golan. So, the government has made some commitments to the 
settlers. The situation is different in the West Bank 
settlements, which were built with the Likud's permission. But 
we will find a solution. We should not forget that when the 
Labor government permitted the building of settlements in the 
Golan, the international situation was totally different from 
what it is today. The Soviet Union was a superpower and it was 
furnishing Syria with weapons. The situation is different now 
and I believe that we will find a solution. I would like to 
tell Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad that he has a great 
opportunity to go down in history as the leader who contributed 
to the establishment of peace in the region. Israel is prepared 
to relinquish Golan if al-Asad is willing to establish real 
peace. 
  [Al-Hinnawi] How do you envision regional cooperation after 
the establishment of peace, particularly since there has been 
much talk lately about a Middle East market? 
  [Aloni] I believe that the beginning should be something 
like 
the Benelux cooperation among Belgium, Netherlands, and 
Luxembourg. Cooperation can start among Israel, Palestine, 
Jordan, and Syria. This can later be followed by cooperation 
involving the Middle East states similar to the European Common 
Market. I think that this will be the picture in the end. As 
minister of communications, it pleases me to say that there are 
telephone lines linking Israel with all Arab states. The 
citizen in any Arab state can pick up the phone and contact 
Israel directly. This was inconceivable just a few years ago. 
I believe that Egyptian diplomacy has played a great role in 
bringing views closer so that peace and prosperity can prevail 
in the region.

  [Text] Gaza City, Occupied Gaza Strip, Jan 12 (AFP) -- 
Israel will release 3,500 Palestinian prisoners when it reaches 
an agreement with the PLO on launching autonomy, PLO chief Yasir 
'Arafat's faction claimed Wednesday [12 January]. 
  But Israeli defence ministry spokesman 'Oded Ben-'Ami denied 
the report. 
  "Israel will free 3,500 detainees when the accord is signed 
and will release all the rest before July 13 provided those 
belonging to (anti-autonomy) factions pledge to stop the armed 
struggle," 'Arafat's Fatah said in a leaflet. 
  General elections are supposed to take place in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on July 13, according 
to the self-rule accord signed by Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation in Washington four months ago. 
  But an Israeli pullout from the occupied territories has 
already been delayed one month. 
  About 11,000 Palestinians are still held in Israeli prisons 
according to international humanitarian organisations. 
  Israel released 101 Palestinians on January 7.

  [Text] Piranshahr, West Azarbaijan, Jan. 12, IRNA -- 
Members of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) operating in 
Iraq's Kurdistan last Monday attacked a military base of a 
Naqshbandi group in Haj Omran, northeast of Iraq, an Iraqi Kurd 
said here today. 
  The same source told IRNA here that right before the attack 
the group's leader Sheikh Mostafa Naqshbandi was entertaining 
PUK members. The source added that PUK members confiscated the 
arms at the disposal of the Naqshbandi group. 
  Although the PUK has denied any involvement in the incident, 
sources close to Jalal Talebani have disclosed that the 
Naqshbandi group was attacked because the group was an Islamic 
one. 
  The self-styled parliament of the Iraqi Kurdistan had passed 
a law earlier for public disarmament. Observers feel that the 
incident is a prelude to new inter-group clashes.

<F P=106> ["Above the Redline" column by National Assembly member </F>
Fawzi al-Mashhadani: "Prices of the State and Mixed Sectors' 
Products"] 
  [Text] It seems that the soaring prices fever has not only 
affected the private sector's products, but also the state and 
mixed sectors' prices. If we consider the phenomenon carefully, 
we cannot attribute it to the economic blockade, which has 
recently been viewed as a source of all problems, including the 
soaring prices phenomenon. Most companies and establishments 
are still using their assets of the raw materials that were 
stored before the economic blockade, as well as some 
alternatives, in order to perpetuate the production process. 
  At the same time, we know that the unjust economic blockade 
has halted the import of raw and supplementary materials. 
Therefore, the surge in the prices of these establishments' 
products cannot be attributed to the increase in costs. Aside 
from increases in the workers' wages, no change occurred in the 
framework of the cost. Therefore, the level of costs in these 
establishments is still reasonable because the elements of the 
cost, except the wages, have not changed to justify the rise in 
prices by more than three to five times the prices a year ago. 
  If we review these prices, we will find, for example, that 
the prices of the products of the State Enterprise for Leather 
Industry have risen by more than five times. A pair of men's 
shoes that were sold for 50 to 70 dinars in 1992 were sold for 
185 to 400 dinars in 1993. This also applies to all the items 
this state enterprise produces. The same is also true of 
textile companies and electrical industries. However, the rise 
in the prices of the mixed sector's products was much more than 
that of the state sector. The prices of the Light Industries 
Company's products have increased up to 4,500 to 6,000 dinars. 
[sentence as published] Similarly, the prices of the products 
of the Electronics Industries Company, the dyes industry, the 
alcoholic drinks industry, and other mixed sector establishments 
have also risen. 
  Scientifically speaking, the rise in these prices can be 
attributed to the policy of increasing the profits of the 
project instead of the establishment's production capacity, or 
that this phenomenon has nothing to do with economic laws, which 
seek to increase the net income by using the means of production 
in the best way, working to introduce scientific inventions in 
the production process, raising the level of production, or 
reducing the costs to the lowest level possible in order to 
raise the margin of profit to a reasonable level in harmony with 
the nature and trends of prices in the market of commodities and 
industry. 
  This shows that these establishments have abandoned their 
responsibility, as well as the social duty required from 
economic and production units, instead of reflecting their 
eagerness to improve the level of performance. This can be 
interpreted by a defect in the economic behavior. These 
establishments behave like the private sector traders, who 
define their prices in light of foreign currency exchange rates 
in the parallel market. This behavior has harmed price levels 
and led to higher inflation rates. Therefore, it can be 
considered as part of a wrong behavior, which will damage the 
economy by fixing unrealistic prices that do not reflect the 
economic situation and production relations. 
  During a meeting with the Council of Ministers, leader 
President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve him, instructed that 
the state enterprises depend on the true cost rather than the 
standard cost, search for opportunities to reduce the costs, and 
adopt austerity measures to limit spending. The concerned 
industrial establishment is required to take these instructions 
seriously and not to adopt such a behavior to define the prices 
of their industrial products, just as the private sector does. 
This fever may also affect the fines imposed on citizens 
violating the instructions of Baghdad municipality and health 
and traffic rules.

<F P=106> ["Text" of speech delivered by Crown Prince Hasan at the </F>
conference on economic and business implications of the 
Arab-Israeli peace process, organized by the Middle East 
Economic Digest in London on 10 January] 
  [Text] Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  It is an honour to deliver the keynote address to the Middle 
East Economic Digest (MEED) conference on the economics of peace 
in the Middle East. With so many distinguished thinkers on this 
subject gathered together today, I feel that we cannot but make 
significant progress in the understanding of this complex area. 
I would like to set the tone by presenting an approach that 
could help achieve a viable framework for the areas to be 
discussed in the three other sessions today: the future of the 
Palestinian economy, the reconstruction challenge, and financing 
the peace. 
  As all those involved with MEED are aware, the entire region 
has been shattered by decades of conflict. While the Middle 
East is potentially self-sustaining in every respect, the 
Arab-Israel conflict has left the economies of the region 
insular in orientation and stunted in development. Crippled by 
debt and the demands of massive military expenditure, not one of 
the countries of the region--including Israel--could at present 
claim to be self-supporting in any meaningful way. Only peace 
can redeem this state of affairs. 
  The Middle East peace process has weathered changes of 
administration in Israel and the United States; it has survived 
political and military crises, and its negotiations have come 
through periods of difficulty to provide fresh hope. If the 
process is currently encountering a number of technical 
obstacles, it has also demonstrated unprecedented resilience. 
Jordan believes that this opportunity to resolve the conflict 
cannot be missed. The no-war, no-peace stasis that holds us in 
its thrall has benefited none of the parties. The accumulation 
of weapons in the region, particularly since the second Gulf 
war, means that the consequences of a future war are 
unthinkable. Peace is therefore the only viable path, and we in 
Jordan are pledged to do all in our power to pursue that path. 
  The mutual recognition of the PLO and Israel last autumn was 
a significant breakthough in Arab-Israeli relations. The 
Conference to Support Middle East peace, held in Washington last 
October, provided guarantees of support and assistance from the 
international community to the Palestinians, to help translate 
the promise of peace into tangible reality. The 
Jordanian-Israeli common agenda was likewise a bold step on the 
road to peace. However, the substance of peace is infinitely 
more complex than its rhetoric. 
  Peace-making has entered a new phase which requires an 
extensive investment in detail and technicalities. Soundbite 
diplomacy is no substitute for substantive negotiation. 
  Jordan is engaged in serious and substantive discussions 
with 
its neighbours, with the aim of delineating areas of future 
cooperation in all spheres. 
  We have just agreed with the Palestinians a cooperation 
agreement at the official bilateral level, at the private sector 
level, and at the Arab and international levels. We will 
explore the details of such fields as money and banking, trade, 
human resources development, tourism, investment promotion, 
taxation, health, agriculture, infrastructure: not the stuff of 
headlines, but the stuff of which true peace is made. 
  For despite the 1988 severance of administrative links, the 
geographic, historic and demographic ties between Jordan and 
Palestine endure. 
  Such factors lie behind our decision to reopen branches of 
Jordanian banks in the occupied territories and to encourage the 
Jordanian private sector to invest in the West Bank and Gaza: 
for these are designed to help the nascent Palestinian economy 
in its development. 
  On the Jordanian-Israeli track, the 
Jordanian-Israeli-American economic committee will provide a 
valuable forum to address all aspects of human resource 
development, trade, finance, economic and monetary policy 
between Jordan and Israel. We now look forward to discussing 
other substantive issues, such as water, boundaries and 
refugees, on the basis of international law. 
  It is possible that in the long term, an arrangement 
similar to that which exists between Belgium, the Netherlands 
and Luxembourg would give all parties the psychological and 
material sense of security that is vital to sustainable peace. 
Jordan's primary role in a Benelux-type arrangement would be to 
provide stability: a role for which it is well-qualified, 
having traditionally served as an island of moderation in an 
otherwise volatile region. In addition, Jordan's historic 
position at the crossroads of East and West, stretching back to 
antiquity, equips it well to be a window for the world on a new 
Middle East, one finally at peace. 
  However, the disparties and distortions created by the 
conflict must be eliminated if such arrangements are to enjoy 
lasting success. Peace must be forged between partners, and the 
relationship that exists between Israel and the occupied 
territories is not one of partnerhsip, but of hegemony. The 
Israeli occupation has destroyed the economies of the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, preventing the development and expansion of 
Palestinian enterprise, and prohibiting free trade within the 
area. A recent World Bank study shows that in a "normal" 
situation, Israel would account for a fifth of the occupied 
territories' exports and a third of their imports; instead, 85 
per cent of their trade is with Israel. Whatever the nature of 
the Palestinian entity agreed upon for the occupied territories, 
it would not serve the interests of any party for it to be 
subject to a single set of incentives. 
  Even under conditions of peace, the disparity between the 
Israeli economy and those of the other core parties to the 
conflict would demand appropriate measures to fashion a balanced 
relationship in a graduated manner. The examples of Spain and 
Portugal within the EU bear consideration in this regard. This 
is particularly vital as the Israeli economy has many 
restrictive features and is heavily subsidised. Given a 
negotiated peace, the complete removal of these features on both 
sides would be possible; but at the moment, when Israeli limits 
on our export to the occupied territories closely resemble 
boycott provisions, talk of lifting the Arab embargo is 
premature. 
  A GATT-EU approach could be the best way to deal with the 
economic legacies of the conflict. Indeed, Jordan has decided 
to apply for membership of GATT; for we believe that in seeking 
to envolve a healthy trade and investment regime, the 
experience of other countries--such as the Zone Franche 
arrangements between Geneva and France--will be invaluable. The 
European Commission recently approved a communication on "Future 
Relations and Cooperation Between the Community and the Middle 
East," illustrating the importance of experience in other parts 
of the world. The communication stresses the need for a common 
regional vision as a basis for cooperation in the Middle East. 
It states: 
  "Partnership requres balanced economic development. If 
cooperation is to succeed it is essential to reduce excessive 
disparties in income levels between potential partners in the 
region." It adds that: 
  "Cooperation should go in two directions: the pooling of 
common capacities and the tackling of common problems ... 
implying, at some stage, freedom of movement for goods, 
services, capital and labour." 
  If one thing is clear at this point, it is that peace cannot 
be piecemeal. All the peoples of the region have suffered 
through the conflict; and just as all have their part to play in 
its rebuilding and renewal, so must its fruits be distributed 
equitably. 
  For it should never be forgotten that peace is ultimately 
not 
in the hands of governments, but of individuals; and unless 
peace can be made attractive to the man on the street, the best 
efforts of negotiators will come to nought. 
  Jordan, nearest to the core of the conflict, has shouldered 
an enormous human load. We have given shelter to three waves of 
displaced Palestinians. These refugees--about 1.7 million 
individuals--account today for one third of Jordan's population. 
The demographic strain on my country is vast; and the conflict 
has also had consequences in terms of debt. We are grateful for 
President Clinton's public commitment on the part of the United 
States to debt relief for Jordan, as our $7bn. debt overhang is 
a real obstacle to the progressive policies which we wish to 
adopt. We seek to attract foreign investment, to upgrade 
infrastructure and to participate fully in regional projects. 
Jordan is committed to the peace process, to democratisation 
and economic liberation, to human rights, sustainable 
development and regional cooperation. But if we are to promote 
these policies effectively, exceptional efforts will be needed 
in respect of our debt burden. 
  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
  International investment in development projects that serve 
the region and its peoples is vital. it is equally important 
that such projects be founded upon sound concepts, and that they 
receive the support of international financial institutions, 
governments and multinational corporations alike. A basketing 
approach, covering human cooperation, resource cooperation and 
security, must be evolved. Peace requires an enduring structure 
that can tackle the 'over-arching' problems of economies of the 
region: disparities created by conflict, over-extended public 
sectors, addiction to aid on the one hand and oil revenues on 
the other. An economic framework is needed to deal with such 
problems. This must in turn be backed up by wide-ranging 
security and cooperation arrangements at the regional level, 
involving all players. The multilateral component of the peace 
process provides a possible framework for this enterprise. 
  Given such arrangments, the reconstruction of the Middle 
East 
could proceed apace. In terms of economic development, a 
free-trade zone across the Middle East would be the ultimate 
goal. Arrangements for a Middle East Free Trade Agreement--a 
MEFTA along the lines of NAFTA--would allow the region to play a 
more creative role in the world economy. In aspiring to this 
goal, it will be necessary to consider the freedom of movement 
of all factors of production: labour, goods, capital and 
services. In this context, a dialogue on the rights of migrant 
labour emerges as a vital prerequisite; for the existence of 
surplus labour in the north, and capital in the south, 
immediately suggests a viable regional trade regime. 
  Such a development would provide an impetus for a new 
relationship of hope in the Middle East. Many other instruments 
would back this up. First and foremost, there needs to be a 
commitment to arms control from the purchasers and suppliers of 
weaponary. Secondly, regional bodies and charters will help 
ensure equity in resource-related areas such as energy and 
water; while incentives for local sustainable development 
programmes can support policies that guarantee a future for all. 
Finally, a regional debt sinking fund, and a bank for Middle 
East reconstruction and development, will promote stable and 
open financial practices, improving the chances for the region 
to play a dynamic part in the world economy. 
  For many of the problems of the Middle East stem from the 
fact that the climate of conflict has forced the diversion of 
funds away from long-term development and into the military. 
Generations have grown up in a region which has prioritised 
military security above health or education. In a Middle East 
established by a negotiated peace, and upheld by structures of 
collective security and cooperation, these funds could at last 
be channelled into building the social and economic foundations 
of peace, which are the surest foundations of all. 
  In all these areas, the experience and assistance of the 
international community of nations, and the international 
business community, will be indispensable to the Middle East. I 
am sure that conferences of this sort will help to deepen 
international understanding of the tasks at hand. I would like 
to thank the organisers for all their efforts; and I would like 
to thank you all for your attention.

toward bringing about peace in the region. 
  For his part, Villiar conveyed the Spanish prime minister's 
greetings to the prime minister, as well as the pride he takes 
in the existing relations between the two friendly countries. 
  Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for foreign 
affairs, 
met with Dr. Francisco Villiar at the Foreign Ministry today. 
They discussed the special Jordanian-Spanish relations, 
nurtured by His Majesty King Husayn and His Majesty King Juan 
Carlos. Dr. Villiar conveyed the Spanish foreign minister's 
greetings to al-Hasan and talked about Spain's role in calling 
for the Madrid Middle East peace conference. He also referred 
to Spain's relations with the Arab countries, particularly with 
Jordan. 
  The two sides praised the Madrid peace conference as a 
historical step that brought together the disputing parties in 
the Middle East and turned the conference into a legal term of 
reference to resolve the Middle East issue.

  [Text] AL-BILAD has learned that 12 Islamists were arrested 
in a large-scale arrest campaign conducted after midnight two 
weeks ago. 
  The night visitors concentrated their campaign on al-Nuzhah, 
Wadi al-Haddadah, al-Rusayfah, al-Mafraq, and other areas of 
Amman. 
  Musa Hasan Sulayman and his brother Mustafa were arrested in 
Bayadir Wadi al-Sayr, while Muhammad Fakhri, Nabil 
Abu-Harithiyah, and Iyad Shaqildi were arrested in other Amman 
areas. 'Ala' Abu-Uways and Jawad al-Faqih were arrested in 
al-Rusayfah. 
  The security forces stormed the houses of 'Isam Muhammad 
Tahir, known as Abu-Muhammad, and Ahmad Faysal Nazzal and 
confiscated books and papers. The security forces are still 
searching for the two men who are accused of leading an illegal 
religious group. 
  AL-BILAD learned that the arrested are charged with 
affiliation to an illegal party, Muhammad's Army, and that they 
are mainly Jordanians who volunteered to fight in Afghanistan. 
  The security organs accused Muhammad's Army of attempting to 
topple the regime two years ago.

  [Text] Reacting to remarks by the mayor of the Mtullah 
settlement and the Israeli Government's demand for the 
restoration of 400 donums [1 donum equals 1.4 acres] of 
agricultural land in the Marj 'Uyun valley, deputy Habib Sadiq 
said: We are not surprised. This is the unchanged position of 
the Israeli entity's officials. What we find peculiar is that 
this demand is made on the eve of the U.S.-Syrian summit and at 
a time of preparations for further negotiations, particularly on 
the Lebanese and Syrian tracks. 
  Deputy Sadqi warned Lebanese officials against falling into 
the traps set up by the Israeli enemy, and he called on them to 
stand firmly by our legitimate and just rights. He called on 
Lebanese officials not only to insist on Israel's withdrawal 
from all Lebanese territories but also to hand back all the 
Lebanese land and water resources that it has usurped. He 
pointed out that Israel has confiscated 13 farms constituting 
all the agricultural land of Shib'a.

  [Text] In the south, the Israeli occupation forces shelled 
Iqlim al-Tuffah, Mlita, and al-Luwayzah from their positions in 
al-Zaffatah. Israeli military planes overflew al-Nabatiyah, 
Iqlim al-Tuffah, and Sidon for 15 minutes, carrying out 
low-altitude mock raids. 
  According to our correspondent, Israeli occupation forces 
surrounded Rumaysh, near Bint Jubayl, this morning. The reason 
for the move was that 15 village youths refused to enlist in 
Lahd's [South Lebanese Army -- SLA] militia. 
  Norwegian soldiers of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon, 
stationed in al-'Urqub, tried to prevent an Israeli Lahdist 
force from entering Shab'a, but the latter succeeded in entering 
the village following one hour of negotiations. 
  REUTER cites a security source in the south to the effect 
that Lahd militiamen deployed this morning on main roads leading 
to villages in the western sector of the occupied border strip 
in order to impress men aged 16 to 35 for military training with 
the said militia. The militia threatened to take measures 
against the families of those who fail to undergo training. The 
source adds that the militias have set up roadblocks on the main 
roads and intend to search houses for men in the said age group.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: The upcoming Syrian-U.S. summit in 
Geneva continues to receive the world's attention. Politicians, 
observers, and media analysts consider this summit the most 
prominent event of the year given that it may activate the 
Middle East peace process and achieve positive, honorable, and 
satisfactory results on all tracks. 
  The fact that 4,000 reporters from all over the world are 
flocking to Geneva gives an idea of the attention given by the 
world community to this summit and the great aspirations raised 
by it. The sincere hope that the results of this summit will be 
translated on the ground into a just and comprehensive peace in 
the region and into prosperity in the post-peace era. This 
large-scale concern over the Syrian-U.S. summit is evidence of 
the entire world's yearning to achieve a firm peace in the 
Middle East, the principal supporter of which is Syria. 
  The world community is fully aware that separate deals do 
not 
achieve peace but increase tension. It is also aware that 
Syria's call for a just, comprehensive, and honorable peace 
based on Security Council resolutions opens the road toward real 
stability in the region. 
  There is no doubt that the entire world is sick and tired of 
Israel's repressive and inhuman acts inside the occupied Arab 
territories. These acts worry the human conscience and cause it 
to question the purpose behind the international silence over 
Israel's serious violations of international principles and laws 
and the point behind the super powers' use of double standards. 
  Israel is imposing a tight siege on the occupied 
territories. 
The Israeli Army and Zionist settlers are destroying Arab 
neighborhoods, scorching property owned by Palestinians, and 
killing Palestinians. Moreover, Israel rejects the Security 
Council resolutions and insists on occupation and expansion and 
on obstructing the peace efforts. All this constitutes a real 
threat not only to Middle East peace but to world peace as well, 
given the impact the Middle East has throughout the world. 
  It is worth noting that this world concern focuses on the 
need for Israel to submit to the resolutions of international 
legitimacy and to frankly announce that the Golan is Syrian 
territory, from which Israel should fully withdraw. This is a 
sign that Syria's sincere efforts to achieve peace have born 
fruit. The world community never cast doubts on the Arab's 
intentions, but is casting doubts on Israel's intentions and is 
denouncing its intransigent stands. The world community went 
beyond this, noting that President al-Asad's stands are 
principled stands that cannot be bargained over. 
  The world's great politicians always take international 
public opinion into consideration. International public opinion 
demands a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East that 
removes the Israeli occupation and restores to the Palestinians 
their national legitimate rights, the most important of which is 
their right to self-determination. 
  Certainly, President al-Asad, who has been known as a man of 
principle and decisionmaking, will not only represent Syria but 
will represent all the Arabs as well. He will be the staunch 
defender of the principles of right, justice, and fairness, 
without which there can be no peace in the Middle East. 
  Peace contradicts occupation and occupation contradicts 
dignity. A stable and firm peace must be based on justice and 
dignity. Justice stipulates the full withdrawal of Israel from 
all the occupied Arab territories. Dignity stipulates the 
restoration of the Palestinian people right to regain their 
freedom and self-determination. 
  The Arab-Israeli conflict has many important and serious 
aspects. These include Israel's withdrawal from the occupied 
territories, the Palestinian people's rights, the issues of 
refugees, evacuees, displaced people, and deportees. All of 
these aspects are collective and their solutions lie in 
implementing Security Council resolutions and entrenching the 
principles of international law. The success of the summit, 
which is important to the entire world, is contingent on its 
success in tackling these issues.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "On the Eve of the Historic 
Summit," AL-BA'TH says: The exceptional attention given to the 
Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton 
is due primarily to the interest in achieving peace in the 
Middle East; a peace which is considered an international demand 
more than it is a regional or local demand. That attention is 
also due to the fact that Syria is the cornerstone in the making 
and maintenance of peace. The strategic view of Syria's 
president, Arab leader Hafiz al-Asad, has been confirmed by 
events and experiences to be credible, sound, and concerned for 
establishing a just and comprehensive peace, that is based on 
the resolutions of international legitimacy and which 
corresponds to the aspirations of the world community to defuse 
tension and wars in the region and establish peace and security. 
  The expected summit in Geneva is yet another positive 
response by Syria aimed at giving another opportunity for the 
peace process to proceed forward toward the set objective, 
namely the establishment of the just and comprehensive peace in 
the region. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Syria's positive stands toward the peace 
process have helped keep this process viable and alive and 
blocked the Israeli rulers' stands and intentions aimed at 
undermining this process and distorting it through partial, 
incomplete deals. 
  The paper stresses that the constructive cooperation 
displayed by Syria toward the initiative of the former George 
Bush administration and the current Clinton administration has 
played a decisive role to ensure that the chances for peace are 
not squandered, that the comprehensive nature of the solution is 
not undermined, and that the objectives and foundations of the 
initiative are not bypassed. 
  The paper stresses that peace can only be achieved with the 
return of the land and the ending of occupation. The paper 
further stresses that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks are 
integrated and the peace process cannot be completed without 
them; that stability in the region is vital and important and is 
a principal element for world security; and that such a 
stability can only be realized by achieving the just and 
comprehensive peace that is based on international legitimacy 
and the UN resolutions. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: When leader al-Asad decides 
comprehensive peace in exchange for complete withdrawal, he is 
stressing the equation of right and justice that can be accepted 
by all nations and peoples and that can entrench and maintain 
peace. Syria is committed to the peace it advocates and to all 
of its dimensions and results. Syria means exactly what it 
says, and there can be no deviation from what President Hafiz 
al-Asad says. 
  Within the same context, and under the headline 
"Comprehensiveness and Stability," TISHRIN writes: As we follow 
all the assessments, analyses, and expectations on the summit, 
the basic fact that comes clearly to light is that when Syria 
leads the process to achieve the just and comprehensive peace in 
the region, Syria is in fact strengthening the course of 
international legitimacy on the basis of right, justice, ending 
occupation, and placing the region on the path of stability and 
security, away from hegemony, terrorism, expansionism, wars, and 
calamities. 
  The paper adds: By adhering to the comprehensive and just 
solution, Syria is reaffirming that if the region is to enter 
the age of peace then this can only be achieved by implementing 
the UN resolutions and the principles of the U.S. initiative, 
foremost of which is the return of land to its rightful owners, 
a positive serious Israeli response to the requirements of peace 
and ending the occupation of the occupied Arab territories, 
dismantling settlements, and putting an end to the Israeli iron 
first and expansionist aggressive policy. The paper adds: With 
this alone, the Arabs can guarantee their rights and with this 
alone the just and comprehensive peace can be achieved. 
  TISHRIN concludes by saying: Syria, together will all 
sincere advocates of the just and comprehensive peace, sees in 
the Geneva summit a major event. It hopes that this summit, and 
its positive results, will provide a real ground to achieve a 
just and comprehensive peace, which is an essential requirement 
for regional stability. 
  On the same subject, and under the headline "Syria's 
Strength," AL-THAWRAH says: The world is paying great attention 
to the summit, hoping it will yield positive results for the 
future of peace, security, and stability in the Arab region. 
Meanwhile, Israel is standing alone, fabricating clamor over 
the summit even before it convenes in an attempt to reshuffle 
cards, hoping that the Geneva summit will not yield the expected 
results. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: Israel, which is avoiding the real and just 
peace, does not want the peace process to return to the correct 
path. The paper adds: It is hoped that the summit will return 
the peace process to its correct path, whereby a U.S. commitment 
to the spirit of the U.S. initiative itself will make Israel 
face the fact that it cannot escape international legitimacy and 
that it must provide the requirements for the just and 
comprehensive peace that can do justice to the Arabs and 
guarantee the return of their occupied territory and usurped 
rights. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: Leader al-Asad is not going 
to Geneva to talk about the Golan Heights alone. He will be 
carrying with him the concerns of the nation and care for its 
future and critical issues. Historic leadership goes to leader 
al-Asad, who embodies loyalty to the pan-Arab issues and views 
Syria's national interests from the pan-Arab perspective. This 
is the secret of Syria's strength and important role, chartered 
by leader al-Asad with its pan-Arab dimensions. This is also 
the reason why its decision is so considerable and stands so 
decisive in every pan-Arab issue.

  [Text] Dear listeners, with the passage of every day the 
need for the disarming of Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin's militia 
becomes more urgent. The BAKHTAR Information Agency political 
commentator writes: 
  The shameful past of the leaders of the conspirators against 
the Islamic state, and the savagery they inflicted on our nation 
over the previous 14 years and over the past one and half years, 
has made all heroic mojahedin of the country join in fighting 
against the lackeys of the aliens after the declaration of jihad 
and to eliminate the last pockets of Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin's 
lackey militia. National traitor Karmal, who has once again 
embarked on conspiracy and crime, is the most defamed element. 
He was an instrument in the hands of the Russian aggressors and 
became a tool for their invasion of our country. His puppet 
force was crushed under the feet of the mojahedin, and he has 
become a shameful figure in history. 
  Golboddin Hekmatyar has resorted to numerous coups and 
allied 
himself each time with an anti-national element. Over the one 
year and eight months since the Islamic revolution, he has 
washed the city of Kabul in blood many times, and each time has 
come up with various pretexts to satisfy his ill intentions. 
This time he has allied himself with national traitor Karmal 
and has revealed his features. 
  Abdorrashid Dostam, a lackey of the communists and the 
murderer of [words indistinct], has this time followed the 
instruction of national traitor Karmal and hatched a conspiracy 
[passage indistinct] 
  Karmal-Golboddin's defamed and anti-Islamic militia fire 
rockets and drop bombs on civilians and specific government 
installations in retaliation for their defeats. These acts, 
which are a product of their savage characteristics, have been 
used against our Muslim nation in the past as well. However, 
one thing is clear to all: The 14 years of aerial bombardment by 
the invaders made the mojahedin braver and increased the 
resistance of our Muslim people, and now again these 
bombardments have increased the anger of our people and 
consolidated the ranks of the mojahedin. 
  There is one more issue. Some people make efforts to 
lengthen the life of the conspirators by trying to arrange a 
cease-fire. Now that they are on the verge of definite 
elimination, any kind [word indistinct] of cease-fire will mean 
giving further opportunity to their remnants. Past experience 
also shows that Golboddin Hekmatyar was saved from certain 
defeat every time by his foreign supporters. 
  It is true that if matters could be resolved through peace, 
this would be better than fighting. But only the total 
elimination of Karmal-Dostam's militia and the resolute decision 
of Golboddin not to resume fighting can be acceptable to the 
mojahedin. All those who have lost their lives during the 
confrontation against this conspiracy and those who fight in the 
first line of the armed jihad ask all those who have intervened 
in this direction and all state and military office holders not 
to accept this cease-fire without the elimination of the 
Karmal-Dostam-Golboddin militia. The country must be cleansed 
of the dirt of the remnants of the national traitor Karmal in 
order that our faithful people can live a peaceful life.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mohammad Hasan Ja'fari, member of the </F>
Central Council of the Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party], of 
Afghanistan, with unidentified correspondent; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How do you assess Afghan 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani's visit to Islamic countries and 
his recent visit to Tajikistan? 
  [Ja'fari] These visits, which took place without the 
coordination of the Jehad Council and the leaders of parties, 
were made within the context of stating party and group 
objectives and positions. In addition to these points, 
Rabbani's visit to Tajikistan also included discussions on the 
problems along the two countries' borders as well as discussions 
on the return of thousands of Tajik refugees to their country. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How do you assess the agreement between 
Rabbani and Mubarak on arresting and handing over Egyptian 
combatants who actively participated in the Afghan jehad for 
many years? 
  [Ja'fari] This agreement has no legal and official status as 
far as the jehadi groups are concerned and can be studied only 
within the framework of a personal view! 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Do you regard Mr. Rabbani's actions as 
illegal? Is this really so? 
  [Ja'fari] The actions by the current Afghan Government are 
illegal, since Mr. Rabbani has trampled on all former 
commitments as well as the Jalalabad agreement, which stipulated 
the mode of participation by all the jehadi parties in managing 
the country. As far as the jehadi parties are concerned, even 
the decisions by the current Hall wa 'Aqd Council are 
unimplementable because of the personal changes that Mr. Rabbani 
has made in its composition. Moreover, none of the four major 
parties of Afghanistan are members in this council. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Some believe that Hezb-e Wahdat appears 
to be confused in Afghanistan's political scene and in its 
approach on other groups. Is this assessment correct? 
  [Ja'fari] The objective of Hezb-e Wahdat is to establish a 
comprehensive peace throughout Afghanistan and it has exerted 
all its efforts and forces toward this end. Hezb-e Wahdat 
represents 25 percent of the Shiite population in Afghanistan 
and wants the rights of the Shiites to be established and social 
and political justice to prevail in society. Therefore, we 
expect other parties to accept and to believe in our logical 
desires. Within this framework, they sometimes impose wars on 
us and we have no other alternative but to defend ourselves. 
But we emphasized that Hezb-e Wahdat has never fomented war. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How has Hezb-e Wahdat reacted to the 
resignation by Golboddin Hekmatyar from his post as prime 
minister? 
  [Ja'fari] As far as we know, Mr. Hekmatyar has not resigned 
and this is only a rumor that has been disseminated by the news 
circles of some of the groups. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] The people of Afghanistan are tired of 
the war and the recent incidents. The unfavorable impact that 
they have had on Afghan public opinion has even put in question 
the beliefs and objectives of the jehadi groups. 
  [Ja'fari] If Hezb-e Wahdat's plan to end the conflicts and 
to 
establish a coalition government had been implemented, we would 
definitely not have been witnessing the avenging and 
expansionist acts by some of the parties today. 
  On the basis of the Hezb-e Wahdat's plan which was also 
agreed on, Afghanistan's major parties comprising the Hezb-e 
Wahdat, the Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society], the Hezb-e 
Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], and the National-Islamic 
Movement of Northern Afghanistan would form a provisional 
council and run the country's affairs until elections were held. 
Also, the other parties too would be in close cooperation with 
the council. However, the explicit opposition by Ahmad Shah 
Mas'ud, leader of the Supervisory Council of the Jami'at-e 
Eslami defeated this plan and this ultimately led to the spread 
of the war. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is the outcome of the many months 
of 
efforts by the Elections Committee? 
  [Ja'fari] Practically nothing. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What objectives are there behind the 
formation of the Constitutional Committee by Borhanoddin Rabbani? 
  [Ja'fari] The formation of this committee does not fall 
within the authorities of Mr. Rabbani because on the basis of 
the Jalalabad agreement, the representatives of all of 
Afghanistan's ethnic groups and tribes should actively 
participate in the formation of such an extensive organization. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What does Hezb-e Wahdat want from the 
future constitution of Afghanistan? 
  [Ja'fari] The recognition of the Ja'fari sect, the election 
of Shiites to form one-fourth of the future government, and the 
participation of the various ethnic groups on the basis of a 
population count in the management of the country's affairs. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] How are relations between Hezb-e Wahdat 
and the other parties in Afghanistan? 
  [Ja'fari] Hezb-e Wahdat has good relations with all the 
groups and is ready to extend a hand of friendship and peace 
toward Sayyaf's Ettehad e-Eslami [Islamic Unity Party] if it 
reviews and corrects its past positions. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What is your opinion on the social and 
security situation in the various parts of Afghanistan? 
  [Ja'fari] Unfortunately, the security situation in most of 
the country's areas is unfavorable and disorder prevails. In 
other words, in each one of the country's provinces a local 
government has been formed and there are no contacts between 
these local governments and the central government. Of course 
there are some areas in northern Afghanistan that enjoy relative 
security and among these provinces we can name Jowzjan, Mazar-e 
Sharif, Sarpol, and Baghlan as well as cities in central 
Afghanistan, namely Bamiyan, Meydan, Gharbi, and Oruzgan. But 
as far as the social situation is concerned, the repercussions 
of the war have rendered the people helpless. The oppressed 
people of Afghanistan and the entire land of Afghanistan are 
suffering from poverty. The situation of the people is 
extremely painful. 
  The people of Afghanistan and especially the residents in 
western Kabul are living under conditions that are very 
difficult to describe. The residents in the Shiite areas in 
west Kabul that are governed by the central government are 
suffering from the central government's disfavor and bias in 
addition to having to suffer the impact of the war and they are 
deprived even of the most essential living essentials such as 
water and electricity. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] International organizations claim that 
they are placing great assistance in the form of food and 
medicine at the disposal of the Afghan Government and some of 
the jehadi groups every day. What do you have to say about this? 
  [Ja'fari] Until now, some consignments of international 
relief organizations were sent to Afghanistan. But I can say 
now that no assistance from abroad is reaching the people of 
Afghanistan at the present time. 
  [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Under the current situation, what 
message 
do you have for the leaders of Afghanistan's jehad parties? 
  [Ja'fari] The people of Afghanistan are sick and tired of 
the 
war and it is not important to them which group is confronting 
whom. The people of Afghanistan seek tranquility, security, and 
peace. The jehadi leaders of Afghanistan are well aware that 
conflicts and clashes cannot and will not yield any victor but 
that there is a balance of power in the country. Therefore, the 
only alternative is to tolerate and to accept one another and 
work to lay the foundation for a general understanding on the 
basis of the interests of all the people of Afghanistan.

  [Text] India has protested to Bangladesh for allowing 
Pakistan's intelligence agency, ISI [Inter-Service 
Intelligence], to operate from its land. New Delhi's concern 
was conveyed by the director general of BSF [Border Security 
Force], Mr. Prakash Singh, at the two-day India-Bangladesh 
coordination meeting which concluded in the capital yesterday. 
The Bangladesh delegation was led by the director general of 
Bangladesh Rifles, Mohammad Anwar Hussain. A BSF spokesman said 
that India also raised the issue of support being received by 
insurgent groups of the Northeast. The question of illegal 
immigration from Bangladesh was also raised at the meeting with 
India insisting that the 1991 agreement at the home secretary 
level should be implemented to sort out the problem. 
  As already reported, both India and Bangladesh agreed at the 
meeting to coordinate their efforts to check smuggling. The two 
sides also decided to undertake delineation of 50 kms of 
undemarcated border. The work on repair and maintenance of 
border pillars along the international border is to be taken up 
with the security forces of the two countries. 
  The BSF spokesman said that both India and Bangladesh have 
agreed that security forces should observe utmost restraint in 
the disputed Muharichar area and take demarcation of the border 
in the 1.6-km stretch immediately.

  [Text] In Jammu and Kashmir, the militancy has declined 
after the Hazratbal [shrine] crisis. This was stated by the 
general officer commanding in chief of the Northern Command, 
Lieutenant General Surendra Singh, while addressing a press 
conference at Udhampur yesterday. He said the militants are 
feeling demoralized. Infighting among the militant groups is 
also a cause of their frustration. The general said the 
situation in the state is under control. He, however, did not 
rule out sporadic incidents of violence or killings by the 
militants to create tension. He said the so-called strongholds 
of militants, like Sopor and some other parts in the valley, 
have been cleared and the people are now heaving a sigh of 
relief.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Sino-Pakistan Link"] </F>
  [Text] Chinese friendship has been an important factor in 
Pakistan's foreign policy from two points of view in the last 
thirty years. First, every government in Islamabad has sought 
Chinese help in procuring military hardware and nuclear know-how 
and materials with varying degrees of success. Secondly, the 
Pakistanis have naturally attached the greatest importance to 
eliciting significant Chinese diplomatic support for its case on 
Kashmir. Benazir Bhutto's visit to Beijing has made hardly any 
difference to bilateral ties from either point of view. As far 
as the first objective is concerned, the Pakistan Prime 
Minister's talks with Premier Li Peng have not produced any 
dramatic result. None of the five documents on cooperation 
signed on this occasion relates to military items although the 
Pakistan Defence Minister, Aftab Shaban Mirani, along with the 
Foreign and Commerce Ministers, were present at the talks 
between the two delegations led by the PMs. It is not clear 
whether this is because Mirani, who was in Beijing three weeks 
ago also, had already transacted military business. The 
possibility of significant military purchases from China cannot, 
of course, be ruled out. If the two sides have decided to carry 
on covert business in this field, that is the established 
pattern all over the world. 
  In terms of the requirements of Pakistan's current 
diplomacy, 
a new helpful gesture by China, on Kashmir was actually far more 
important to Benazir Bhutto. She has not achieved this purpose. 
Li Peng merely reiterated the known Chinese stand that India 
and Pakistan should resolve this question "through patient 
dialogue" and "welcomed efforts conducive to a settlement". 
This advice cannot have been sweet music to the visiting lady's 
ears. It is hardly distinguishable from what the Simla 
Agreement enjoins India and Pakistan to do. As is well know, 
Islamabad pays only lip-service to this agreement while moving 
heaven and earth to sabotage it in practice. The lesson to be 
drawn, therefore, is that the Chinese connection is unlikely to 
give Pakistan more diplomatic manoeuverability than hitherto. 
In a notable amplification of China's present policy on 
Kashmir, the Chairman of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, Li Ruihuan, during his recent visit to 
New Delhi, had also condemned terrorism in any form. 
  The sooner the Pakistani policy-makers realise the futility 
of concentrating on enlisting the support of other countries for 
its claim to Kashmir instead of reaching an amicable settlement 
with India, the better it will be for regional peace and 
stability. To reject such a shift in the face of the demands of 
the new international situation will be to cling to a world of 
make-believe. The challenge before Benazir Bhutto is to lead 
her people not back into the dreary past, but towards a 
reassuring future.

  [Text] ISLAMABAD, Jan 13 (AFP) -- The Pakistani government 
has closed its main crossing point on the border with 
Afghanistan, in a bid to halt a flood of Afghan refugees fleeing 
the fighting in Kabul, officials said Thursday. 
  Thousands of Afghans were blocked after the border crossing 
at Torkham, in the northwest of Pakistan, was ordered closed 
Wednesday, witnesses said. 
  Habibullah Khan, the government's representative for the 
KHYBER AGENCY, said only those bearing a passport and a valid 
visa for Pakistan would be admitted into the country. 
  A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, 
said the Pakistani authorities were willing to help the 
refugees, but this had to be done in Afghanistan. 
  Tens of thousands of civilians have fled Kabul since 
fighting 
erupted between rival factions there on January 1. 
  Pakistan housed three million Afghan refugees during the 
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Several hundred thousand 
returned home after the communist regime fell in April 1992.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Federal Interior Minister Maj Gen 
(retd) Naseerullah Babar. Wednesday said army's operation 
clean-up in Sindh was likely to continue until June. 
  Talking to newsmen here at the exhibition of Japanese 
calendars, he said the police and Rangers were being retrained 
to handle the situation in the province. 
  He said the government was planning to introduce police and 
jail reforms to improve the law and order situation in the 
country. 
  The minister said the Peshawar-based Arab volunteers had 
been 
asked to leave the country before January 31. He said the 
government had decided not to renew the passports of the 
nationals of other countries residing in Pakistan. He said the 
government was facing some difficulties due to its earlier 
decision to issue passports to 150,000 foreigners. 
  About the presence of RAW [Research and Analysis Wing] 
agents 
in the country, the minister said the number of Indians visiting 
Pakistan had increased manifold after the late President Zia's 
cricket diplomacy. He said a large number of Indians made it 
difficult for police to check them properly. 
  About the process of accountability, the minister said: "We 
do not want to harass any one. The government has always taken 
the nation into confidence over major issues." 
  Commenting on the possibility of filing reference against 
the 
Nawaz government functionaries, he said: "We should be 
positive." However, he said, the matter would be decided after 
the finalisation of enquiry report of schemes like Motorway and 
yellow cab. "Whoever plundered the national exchequer will be 
taken to task," he said. 
  He said: "There is no emergency. We do not have much time 
to continue chasing them. We should be firm, the cases should 
not be half-baked like the previous government had done. It was 
just the waste of time and money." 
  Commenting on Nusrat Bhutto's recent remarks, he said the 
government was stable and becoming more and more stable 
day-by-day. He said Nusrat referred to an astrologer and her 
comment was not based on any political analysis. "We do not 
want to be disrespectful to anyone. She is the mother of the 
Prime Minister, but no one is above the law. 
  Asking the press not to exploit the family matter, he said: 
"Nusrat is a mother who faced many tragedies." 
  Gen. Naseerullah Babar said the opposition was trying to 
satisfy their ego. "They are not harming us but the national 
interest," he said. 
  Referring to Nawaz's visit to Bosnia, the minister said it 
should be investigated as to how he got money for the visit. He 
said it was up to the CBR [Central Board of Revenue] to enquire 
into the matter. 
  About Mir Murtaza Bhutto, he said: "if he is declared 
innocent by the court, we will have no objections to his 
release. Let the law take its course. Murtaza Bhutto was not a 
political threat to the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] government 
as he had no impact on the party." 
  About Altaf Hussain, he said: "The MQM [Muhajir Qaumi 
Movement] leader will meet the same fate as Murtaza Bhutto had 
faced," adding that the law was same for everyone.

  [Text] Lahore -- Former Prime Minister and PML (N) 
[Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz] Chief Mian Nawaz Sharif has said 
there are three parallel power centres both in Punjab and Sindh, 
and also in the Federal Government where Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari have created two set-ups 
to run the State affairs and this situation would, ultimately, 
lead to the collapse of the present Government. 
  Addressing a Press conference at his Model Town residence on 
Tuesday, he said the three power centres in Sindh were headed by 
Chief Minister Abdullah Shah, Prime Minister Secretariat and 
Asif Ali Zardari, while in Punjab on the same line Chief 
Minister Manzoor Wattoo, Faisal Saleh Hayat and Asif Ali Zardari 
had their independent establishments to run the governmental 
affairs and this situation would not last long. Lashing out at 
the policies of the Benazir Government, he said the design of 
the Motorway approved by his Government had been changed and the 
number of lanes reduced to four from six just to lessen the 
expenditure of Rs [rupees] 20 billion, but it would incur a loss 
of Rs 30 billion to exchequer in form of fine and the contract 
of a Turkish firm had also been cancelled. 
  Any change in the design would mar the concept of the 
Motorway and it would be just an ordinary road. The 
cancellation of the contract with the Turkish contractor would 
affect "our relations with Turkey" and everybody knows who is 
behind this machination, he added. 
  Mian Nawaz Sharif alleged that the Benazir Government 
allotted a plot in a Karachi katchi abadi [slum] to a person 
after getting a bribe of Rs 120 million and also awarded 
licences for three sugar mills in Sindh and "everyone knows who 
is the man behind the game or who is the shareholder". He 
informed the newsmen that Safdar Abbas Zaidi who was involved in 
the fraud of Rs 130 million in the past had now been appointed 
as Chairman Investment Board. 
  The former Prime Minister said that the Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto was going to Switzerland along with her family to 
settle the accounts of Rs 20 billion and there was no other 
purpose to visit that country. When he was asked about the 
efforts of the PML (C) [Pakistan Muslim League-Chatha] for 
reunification with his faction he remarked "I am representing 
the largest political party of the country and there is no other 
Muslim League and there is no room for those individuals who 
have come to the Assemblies through PPP [Pakistan People's 
Party]". 
  Criticising the present Government's foreign policy Mian 
Nawaz Sharif said that Benazir Bhutto's recent tours to 
different countries were `purposeless' and devoid of commitment. 
He said that during his visit to Bosnia he witnessed the 
helplessness of the Bosnian Muslims who were the victims of 
Serbs brutality and the champions of the New World Order should 
come to the rescue of the oppressed Bosnians. 
  He further said that the NATO leaders meeting in Brussels 
should come at with a clear line of action either to stop 
aggression against Bosnians or let them defend themselves 
lifting arms embargo. 
  He criticised Benazir Bhutto for not giving a warm reception 
to the Bosnian Prime Minister on his visit to Pakistan and said 
that Government showed a lack of commitment on the issues of 
Bosnia and Kashmir which were experiencing through similar 
circumstances. 
  On the Afghanistan situation, Mian Nawaz Sharif said that 
the 
present Government did not help Afghanistan in its 
reconstruction whereas "our Government created an atmosphere of 
accommodation and goodwill among the warring factions following 
the Islamabad Accord".

  [Text] Pakistan has again categorically stated that its 
nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only and it does not 
possess a nuclear weapon, nor does it intend to manufacture any. 
A Foreign Office spokesman said at a press briefing in 
Islamabad yesterday that Pakistan is firmly committed to the 
objective of nuclear nonproliferation and it will accept any 
just and nondiscriminatory mechanism for nuclear 
nonproliferation in South Asia. He was commenting on a report 
published in a local English daily which misquoted the prime 
minister's statement. The spokesman clarified that the 
statement as quoted by the ASSOCIATED PRESS does not represent 
Pakistan's policy, nor was it part of the statement made by the 
prime minister.

  [Text] An official spokesman has categorically denied 
reports that the Pakistani and the Indian troops were involved 
in heavy clashes in the Naushahra sector of Jammu on late Monday 
night which resulted in casualties on both sides. He said that 
no such incident took place and the charge that the Pakistani 
troops resorted to unprovoked firing was baseless. However, it 
may be pointed out that the Indian troops have been 
indiscriminately firing from across the Line of Control on the 
Azad Kashmir civilian population. Special complaints regarding 
all such incidents are being regularly filed by Pakistan with 
the United Nations military observers group in Pakistan.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Kashmir Issue -- the Writing on the Wall; </F>
What Ought to be Done?"] 
  [Text] The seventh round of India-Pakistan secretary-level 
talks has failed and Pakistan has refused to hold any further 
negotiations with India. The foreign secretaries have admitted 
that they have not been able to narrow their differences on the 
Kashmir issue. Pakistan has proposed a five-point formula to 
resolve the dispute. Under this formula, Islamabad has asked 
India to withdraw troops from occupied Kashmir; lift the siege 
of the Hazratbal Shrine and allow the people to pray there; 
improve the human rights situation in occupied Kashmir; 
immediately release detained Kashmiri leaders; and allow 
representatives of international organizations, the news media, 
and diplomats to visit Kashmir so that the world is aware of the 
actual situation there. In response to these Pakistani 
proposals, India has displayed its traditional intransigence. 
For the first time, it sat across the negotiating table 
allegedly without any preparations and described the relevant UN 
resolutions as outdated. In his news conference the Indian 
foreign secretary reiterated that the UN resolutions have become 
irrelevant and that India has repeated this position over and 
over again. By this, the Indian foreign secretary meant to 
convey that New Delhi considers Kashmir an integral part of 
India. Only a day before the start of the current round of 
negotiations, Indian Defense Minister Dinesh Singh also 
reaffirmed this policy. In light of these statements, the 
process of dialogue was nothing but a totally meaningless and 
futile exercise. 
  The only salient feature, if there was any, of this dialogue 
was that for the first time India accepted Kashmir as an item on 
the agenda for discussion, but New Delhi maintained its usual 
intransigence, showing no change in its attitude toward the 
Kashmir issue. 
  It is, however, worth noting that the Indian foreign 
secretary was given extraordinarily warm treatment. Both the 
president and the prime minister spared time to meet him and the 
Pakistani foreign secretary held a record two-hour one-on-one 
meeting. On the other hand, the fact that the president went 
hunting in his ancestral district of Rajanpur and the prime 
minister left Islamabad and convened a meeting of her Cabinet in 
Karachi, some 1,000 miles away, reflects how serious they were 
about these negotiations. It is only the government that can 
understand the logic of this contradictory attitude -- the 
flurry of publicity on one hand and the leaders' apathy on the 
other -- toward these talks. 
  Nonetheless, the fact that the talks would fail was no 
secret. With India describing Kashmir as an integral part, 
there was no room for any dialogue and no meaning in conducting 
that futile exercise. If Pakistan knew all this in advance, 
then why did it agree to hold the dialogue? Was it intended to 
please India or did it not have the courage to resist U.S. 
pressure? Had we created a national consensus on this extremely 
sensitive national issue by mobilizing the support of all 
opposition parties and political and national leaders before the 
talks and then faced the Indian delegation at the negotiating 
table from a position of strength, it would have served us well. 
Earlier, in the hope of promoting goodwill, Pakistan also 
withdrew its resolution [on Kashmir] from the UN General 
Assembly, thereby failing to gain the advantages it could have 
by introducing it in the international body. 
  Now, after the conclusion of the dialogue, the government 
has 
announced that there will be no further talks with India, but 
none of the authorities, including the foreign secretary, 
foreign minister, prime minister or president have taken the 
trouble to tell the people what their policy is for at least 
resolving the Kashmir dispute, or -- God forbid -- they have 
decided to leave the oppressed and helpless Muslims of the Jammu 
and Kashmir valley to the mercy of the Indian beasts. We hope 
such thinking does not exist at any level of the government. 
Wisdom demands that a national policy on the Kashmir cause be 
adopted, rising above partisan prejudices. For this purpose, 
the government should convene an all-party conference which 
should emphasize the need for resolving the Kashmir dispute only 
on the basis of the UN resolutions. Later, efforts should also 
be made to form a strong Islamic bloc at the global level to 
place the Islamic community on a single platform to help resolve 
all serious problems, like Bosnia, Palestine, and Kashmir. 
Several Muslim countries call Pakistan "brother" and India 
"friend," and are not ready to displease the "friend" for the 
sake of pleasing the "brother." So long as the Islamic 
community is not persuaded to enforce an economic and political 
boycott of India, nothing good can be expected from New Delhi. 
As the proverb -- a nod for the wise and a rod for the fool -- 
goes, we need to increase our strength to deal with India.

  [Text] Kathmandu, Jan 12 (AFP) -- As many as three people 
were killed and 32 others suffered bullet and batton injuries 
following a clash between police and residents of the Damak 
district, southeast of Kathmandu, reports reaching the capital 
said Wednesday. 
  A government official, however, reported only one death and 
eight injuries in clashes that took place late Tuesday afternoon 
between police and an infuriated crowd protesting alleged police 
brutality in the Damak district, 298 kilometres (186 miles) 
southeast of here. 
  A senior official of the home ministry said that a mob of 
over 5,000 local residents attacked the Damak police station, 
throwing stones and smashing windows. They also smashed the 
windshields of two police vehicles. 
  At least 30 police officers were injured in the melee, the 
official said. 
  But a Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist 
(NCP-UML) source told AFP that three civilians had died and 32 
were injured. 
  Police fired tear-gas shells, blank rounds and finally a few 
live rounds to disperse the crowd, a senior government official 
said. 
  "Eight people received bullet injuries while others were 
injured in a police batton charge," the official said. 
  "The political situation at Damak is now quiet and normalcy 
has returned after a meeting of political party workers and 
local administration authorities," the official added. 
  The incident was sparked after police allegedly mistreated 
an 
elderly woman whom they had asked to clear the street.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 12, IRNA -- A spokesman for Iran's 
Atomic Energy Organization dismissed as sheer lies an American 
daily report alleging that Iran is after production of nuclear 
weapons and said the hostile move was part of a preplanned U.S. 
plot against the Islamic World. 
  Speaking to IRNA Wednesday, 'Ali Shirzadian strongly denied 
the `U.S. Today' [as recieved] report on Iran's nuclear 
activities and said Iran is one of the active members of the 
Internaional Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and is faithful to its 
commitments as a signatory to the treaty. 
  He noted that Iran's Atomic Energy Organization was 
committed 
to the principle of nuclear inspection adding that it had a 
clear policy and its activities had been for peaceful purposes. 
  The spokesman further said that due to the Islamic 
Republic's 
commitment to the rules, the U.S. hostile propaganda against 
Iran's atomic activities had not least affected the IAEA 
decisions so far. 
  He said that the organization's report to the council of 
governors on Iran's clear atomic policies last fall was a firm 
response to U.S. allegations against the Islamic republic. 
  The IAEA secretary-genaral had said in his report that all 
the sites, buildings and laboratories inspected in Iran were 
devoid of any non-peaceful nuclear activities.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 12, IRNA -- Majles Vice-Speaker Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Hasan Rowhani Wednesday said the Iranian people's 
enmity with the U.S. is a historical, revolutionary, ideological 
and religious matter. 
  "Washington's stance on the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
childish, immature, and unripe," Rowhani said in an interview 
published by the periodical "MAJLES AND RESEARCH". 
  He said "the U.S. is hostile to Iran and it does not make 
its 
hostility a secret...our people have always suffered blows and 
seen violence on the part of the U.S." 
  "The task of determining the basic policies of the country 
and the system initially rests with the leader (Ayatollah 'Ali 
Khamene'i) and he has explicitly reaffirmed that we have no 
interest in relations with the U.S. and that such relations are 
detrimental to us," he said. 
  "Not all countries of the world are friends of the U.S. but 
their tones may differ from ours. They may speak in a 
diplomatic tone or hide their real intentions. But the Islamic 
Republic's positions are clear and obvious," the vice-speaker 
said. 
  He added that despite attempts of enemies to misportray Iran 
as a country wishing to launch aggression on or intervene in the 
internal affairs of other countries what has happened over the 
past few years proved that such rumors were nothing but 
unfounded and baseless propaganda. 
  The parliamentarian maintained that the Islamic Republic has 
managed to show its Islamic and human face to the world 
particularly during the past few years. 
  But, he added, it is natural for a country like Iran which 
intends to live independently in the Third World and in such a 
sensitive region as the Middle East to be threatened by its 
enemies. 
  "Whether wanted or not, the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
shouldering the leadership of many communities of the world. 
But Iran's leadership is different from America's domineering 
leadership... Iran governs hearts of millions of people 
throughout the world," Rowhani reiterated. 
  Iran has been identified as a powerful and independent 
country, as a country whose religion and politics, its people 
and officials are in harmony, a country opposed to aggression, a 
peace-loving country and a country which is truly loyal to its 
slogans and causes, he said. 
  The Majles vice-speaker also blasted the U.S.-sponsored new 
world order and said not only the number of conflicts between 
countries has increased but also a country is occupied by 
another country under the so-called new world order.

  [Text] Reports from Afghanistan indicate that the clashes 
in Kabul have died down and that the conflicting sides are only 
firing at military areas. Our correspondent reports that the 
conflicting sides claim to have inflicted heavy damage on each 
other. 
  A spokesman for General Dostam has said that yesterday a 
plane of the Supervisory Council attacked Bagram Airport, which 
is 60 km northeast of Kabul and is under the control of Ahmad 
Shah Mas'ud. However, a spokesman for Ahmad Shah Mas'ud has said 
that positions of General Dostam's forces and of the Hezb-e 
Eslami [Islamic Party] in the Bala Hesar Heights and Maranjan 
Hill were bombed several times. 
  Another report from Afghanistan also states that our 
ambassador to Afghanistan handed a written message from Velayati 
to the Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party] secretary general 
yesterday. Also, the UN secretary general has announced his 
readiness to send a special political delegation to Afghanistan 
in a bid to establish peace. The UN secretary general's 
statement says that with the help of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and other countries, a group known as the friends of the 
secretary general on Afghan affairs will be formed and will play 
a consultative role in the secretary general's decision.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] After several days of heavy clashes among rival 
groups in Afghanistan, diplomatic efforts are under way to end 
the fighting and bring the positions of the groups involved 
closer together. For that purpose the Islamic Republic of 
Iran's Embassy, just as before, is seeking to restore peace to 
Kabul by mediating between rival political and military groups. 
  In the eyes of political analysts there are three ways to 
end 
the Afghan crisis. The first is for one or two jihadi groups, 
which are more popular than other groups, to act as mediators. 
The second is that friendly and neighboring states mediate 
among the fighting groups. And the third way is for an 
international organization or authority to embark on mediation. 
  Although none of those ways has been able finally to resolve 
the Afghan issue it does not mean that hope should be given up 
for restoring peace and stability and stopping efforts to end 
the internal war in Afghanistan. On this presupposition, the 
Islamic Republic intends to continue its diplomatic efforts and 
in this process expects cooperation from other rival political 
and military groups. 
  From the Islamic Republic's point of view the occurrence of 
any confrontation in Afghanistan, on any pretext at all, is 
condemned. The experience of past bloody clashes has shown that 
because of the extreme factionalism among the warring sides the 
possibility that one side will dominate the other is remote. 
Furthermore, this endless war does not have any consequence 
except the further destruction of Afghanistan and the killing 
and injuring of a greater number of the people of that country. 
Also, it paves the way for abuse by foreign powers. 
  Islamic Iran -- which always was a friend and sympathizer of 
the tyrannized people of Afghanistan during their 14-year jihad 
against the sovereignty of communists -- does not expect the 
jehadi groups to embark on slaughtering each other with the 
massive volume of destructive weaponry in their possession. At 
one time they were fighting along a unified front to topple the 
rule of infidelity and atheism in Afghanistan. They should not 
now utilize Afghanistan's resources and potential to destroy 
rather than reconstruct it. 
  What so far has resulted in a military and political impasse 
is a lack of unified and all-embracing leadership, the 
insubordination of junior commanders toward their commanders and 
leaders, the existence of irresponsible armed groups throughout 
Afghanistan, the widespread availability of arms left from 
before, and, generally speaking, the mistrust of rival political 
and military leaders of each other. Such obstacles have caused 
political analysts to believe that the first step for breaking 
the impasse depends on further flexibility by the jihadi 
leaders. So long as the Afghan political and military leaders 
do not agree on a unified position, attaining an agreement to 
end the fighting and establish peace in Afghanistan will be 
difficult. That is why the Islamic Republic intends -- while 
adopting a policy of noninterference in other states' internal 
affairs -- to bring the positions of the jihadi groups closer 
together through consultation with them and prepare the ground 
for peace and the consolidation of sovereignty in Afghanistan. 
It is expected that the jehadi groups will sincerely cooperate 
and join their efforts with those of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran to reach that sacred objective.
