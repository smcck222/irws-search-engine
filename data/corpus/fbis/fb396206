  [Text] Taba, 18 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser and head of the 
Palestinian side to the Gaza-Jericho Committee, has stated that 
the general atmosphere of today's talks was more positive than 
the round that concluded last week. 
  In statements he made today at the end of the first day of 
meetings of the Gaza-Jericho Committee's current round of talks, 
he added that we must wait until tomorrow to find out the extent 
of the progress that can be made in this round. He noted that 
no tangible progress was made today due to lack of time. 
  He said that the Israeli side still rejects the idea of 
raising the Palestinian flag over the crossings because it is a 
symbol of the Palestinian state. However, he adds, we call on 
the Israelis to adopt a new mode of thinking that befits the 
peace atmosphere. At this stage, this flag is a symbol of the 
Palestinian identity and not a symbol of the state. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th clarified that there were some differences 
over the crossings into Gaza and Jericho, as well as over the 
border points from Egypt, Gaza, Jordan, and the Jericho area, 
and defining the method of control over these crossings. He 
noted the importance of cooperation and coordination regarding 
the control over the crossings between the two sides. 
  He said the Palestinian side did not present any new 
proposals on the subject of the crossings. But the Palestinian 
paper that was presented during the previous round and the 
Israeli paper submitted today constitute the two stances that 
need to be agreed on. 
  He added that the Palestinian side accepts the Israeli 
electronic supervision of the crossings because it preserves the 
dignity of people and is secure at the same time. It also 
prevents weapons from being smuggled across the crossings, as 
well as catching people who carry out acts of aggression. 
  Dr. Sha'th said that some progress was made in Civil Affairs 
Committee's activities, which specializes in the transfer of 
authority, services, and facilities from the Israeli side to the 
Palestinian side. He noted that some progress could be made in 
issuing the personal identity cards and residence permits, the 
historic sites, and various other subjects. He affirmed that he 
expects the Civil Affairs Committee to end its work next week 
through written texts. 
  He affirmed that the Palestinian-Jordanian economic and 
security agreement, which was recently signed, has improved and 
bolstered the atmosphere of the Gaza-Jericho Committee 
negotiations. 
  He added that the political determination to find an 
agreement is what determines how long the Gaza-Jericho 
negotiations will continue. He noted that in the case where 
this determination is available, three weeks is enough to reach 
an agreement between the two sides. Otherwise, the negotiations 
will take much longer.

  [Text] Israel, Jordan, and Egypt will establish a joint 
system of installations, equipment, and early-warning units in 
the northern part of the Gulf of Elat to deal with possible oil 
spills in the sea. The early-warning units will be placed in 
three locations -- Elat, 'al-'Aqabah, and al-Nuwaybi' -- and 
will be built with EC financing. The decision to set up the 
joint system was made at a meeting held in al-Nuwaybi' in the 
Sinai by the multinational committee on environment affairs 
within the framework of the peace talks. The systems will be 
built within one to one and a half years 
  (Christian Falkovsky), the EC representative who presided 
over the meetings, told our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling 
that he hopes Saudi Arabia will join the efforts to save the 
environment at a later stage. Our correspondent points out that 
it is estimated that the European financing of the system will 
total $10 to $15 million.

  [Text] Libyan ministers are facing extreme hardship 
because the venue of the Libyan cabinet meetings has been moved 
to al-Kufrah, a desert region 800 km away from Tripoli. The 
ministers, who have their homes in Tripoli, are thus forced to 
remain in al- Kufrah. 
  The decision to move the venue of the cabinet meetings came 
as a punishment from al-Qadhdhafi to the ministers after Prime 
Minister Abu-zayd Durdah submitted a memorandum of reforms that 
he prepared with 'Abd-al-Salam Jallud, who has secluded himself 
in his home after al-Qadhdhafi refused to discuss the memorandum 
with him.

  [Text] Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, president of the 
republic, has described the foreign interference in Sudan's 
internal affairs as an obstacle to the settlement of the 
country's problems through dialogue. He said that the 
Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development is 
working for a peaceful settlement of [word indistinct] the south 
and other African areas. Lt. Gen. al-Bashir explained that the 
information campaign launched by the Western states against 
Sudan, which lacks substantiation and evidence, aims to distort 
the reputation of Sudan. In an interview in the magazine 
SOCIETY, he said that diplomats residing in Khartoum and some 
neutral personalities had confirmed that Sudan's record of human 
rights is better than that of the advanced states. Some envoys 
of human rights organizations also witnessed to the nonexistence 
of violations of human rights in Sudan. 
  On American hostility toward Sudan, Lt. Gen. al-Bashir 
explained that the cause of disagreement between Sudan and the 
United States began after the existence of a sovereign 
independent leadership in Sudan. His Excellency added that the 
United States wants a government that can be controlled. It 
also sees Islam as a threat to its interests in the Middle East 
and the states neighboring the region. 
  This is in addition to the effect on American foreign policy 
in the Middle East of the Zionist Israeli orientation that is 
biased against Islam.

  [Text] Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, president of the 
Republic, has affirmed that the government is striving, with 
firm steps, towards consolidating the pillars of federal rule at 
this historic stage through which the country is passing. This 
was said when he met, in his office today at the Friendship 
Hall, a delegation from Bara Province visiting Khartoum to take 
part in the consultative meeting which convened recently between 
the president and executive and popular leaderships to discuss 
the redivision of the states. 
  Lt. Gen. al-Bashir explained to the delegation that the 
government relies upon the project for the redivision of the 
states because of the revenue that it will achieve in the field 
of development, despite its exorbitant financial cost. Lt. Gen. 
al- Bashir explained that the new states need an unleashing of 
energies and the deployment of available resources to guarantee 
the continuation of true development. He pointed out that there 
is no way of building Sudan except by self-reliance and 
concerted official and popular effort.

<F P=106> [Gerald Butt report: "Saddam Survives Attack"] </F>
  [Text] Nicosia -- President Saddam Husayn has survived 
another attempt on his life -- the third since last 
summer-according to a highly placed Iraqi official. 
  The official said in the Jordanian capital, Amman, that a 
lieutenant in the army opened fire on the Iraqi leader in 
Baghdad earlier this month. The officer appeared to be acting 
alone, he said. The official, who did not wish to be named, also 
confirmed reports which emerged from Baghdad three weeks ago 
about a bomb attack against the presidential convoy. 
  The explosive device had been left in a tractor abandoned by 
the roadside and was detonated as the convoy passed on Dec 28. 
  Last summer between 60 and 300 people were arrested and put 
to death, accused of being involved in an aborted coup attempt. 
Many of those rounded up were senior and trusted figures in the 
regime and came from Saddam's home city of Takrit. 
  According to Iraqi opposition sources, the latest attempt on 
the president's life may have been carried out by an officer who 
was seeking revenge for the death of a member of his family in 
the purge.

  [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve 
him, has said that all great missions, including the roles of 
the prophets in conveying God's message to mankind, are first 
communicated to a few people and then to millions of people. 
This came during a meeting he held today with a delegation from 
the International Committee of the Athens International 
Conference on Solidarity With Iraq. The conference was held in 
Athens on 6-7 November 1993. His excellency added: What we 
should do as people -- as well as officials who are aware of 
their nation's objectives regarding human relations -- is to 
work as hard as we can to reach a sound level in terms of human 
ties and relations among nations. 
  Addressing the chairman and members of the committee, his 
excellency, may God preserve him, said: The work you are 
undertaking is considered great by almighty God and by the 
people of the world, because you are truly democratic and 
because you want to see others enjoying what you yourselves are 
enjoying. He added: Meanwhile, the others -- those who speak 
about democracy and human rights -- kill and slaughter people 
and then continue to kill people by starving them.

  [Text] Baghdad, Jan 18, INA--The headquarters of Iraq's 
Defence Ministry was reopened on Monday after Iraqi 
reconstruction teams have restored the historical magnificence 
of the first group of the Ministry's buildings which came under 
successive air and missiles attacks during the 1991 U.S.-led war. 
  A celebration was held at the site of the reconstructed 
premises attended by Defence Minister General 'Ali Hasan 
al-Majid, the Army chief of staff and senior Army offices. 
  The reconstruction work included the removal of 225,000 
tones 
of debris of 17 buildings. Eight new buildings were 
reconstructed in addition to over-all repair work for 11 other 
buildings which were partly damaged. 
  On January 17, 1991, the Defence Ministry headquarters came 
under air and missile attacks. It was attacked again on January 
19 and 23, complete parts of the Ministry were demolished. 
  The old buildings were replaced with new modern ones that 
have exactly the same distinct architectural features of the 
destroyed ones.

  [Excerpt] The three Bosnian factions and the international 
mediators will meet in Geneva again today in order once more to 
discuss the peace plan which splits Bosnia into three 
territorial entities. Today, the foreign ministers of eight 
Muslim countries will be in Geneva to lend their support to the 
Bosnian Muslims. Yesterday, they were received by the UN 
Secretary General. The secretary general of the Islamic 
Conference Organization [Hamid al-Ghabid] spoke to our reporter 
Luc Lemmonier: 
  [Begin al-Ghabid recording] It was a very positive, very 
encouraging meeting. Our contribution was designed to bring 
about progress in the negotiations. The secretary general, as 
you know, has great responsibilities regarding the recourse to 
NATO air strikes. We have asked the secretary general to stand 
by his responsibilities. Of course, he is ready to do so 
provided he is not blocked by certain countries. 
  The Islamic Conference is willing to cooperate with the 
international community in the search for a just solution to 
this conflict; it is prepared to contribute politically, 
morally, and financially -- and militarily -- to this end. The 
Islamic countries have long been proposing the use of troops. 
We would wish to see the obstacles to this removed. [end

  [Text] Geneva, Jan 18, SPA -- Foreign ministers of the 
Organisation of Islamic Conference have called for a just 
settlement of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Members of a 
ministerial contact committee, who concluded a meeting in Geneva 
yesterday issued a statement on behalf of the OIC, expressing 
their deep anxiety over the failure of the Security Council in 
shouldering its responsibilities toward the Bosnian problem and 
the council's failure to implement its resolutions in this 
connection. 
  The ministers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Tunisia, Pakistan, 
Senegal and Iran have expressed the OIC states' readiness to 
take part in the peace talks between the conflicting parties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. They also regretted the diplomatic and 
military pressures being practiced against the Bosnian 
Government in order to accept the disintegration of the 
independent state of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The statement said the 
Islamic countries rejected the description of the conflict as "a 
civil war." 
  The ministers urged the world community and the chairman of 
the international conference on the former Yugoslavia to 
implement the U.N. resolutions and the principles of the 
international law. They paid tributes to the Bosnian Government 
for its flexibility and constructive stands during the peace 
talks. 
  The statement expressed OIC's deep sorrow over the 
continuation of aggression against the Bosnian people despite 
the current peace negotiations. It urged all conflicting 
parties in Bosnia- Herzegovina to implement the ceasefire and 
halt all offenses in order to create a conducive atmosphere for 
peace. 
  "The success of the peace process requires respect for the 
independence and sovereignty of Bosnia and the return of the 
land usurped by the Serbs with the use of force against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  The statement reiterated OIC's readiness to provide 
peace-keeping forces under the patronage of the U.N. and called 
on the NATO to carry out air strikes against Serb positions in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It also expressed the Islamic states' grave concern over the 
volatile situation in Croatia. 
  The statement said the OIC calls upon the International 
Court 
of Justice to begin its work on the situation in Bosnia and to 
put before justice the war criminals. It appealed for 
maintaining the current boycott against Serbia and Montenegro 
until a final settlement is achieved.

  [Excerpt] Alexandria, 16 Jan (MENA)--Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has praised Egypt's leading 
contribution to a peaceful settlement in the Middle East and to 
Arab reconciliation and solidarity. 
  Speaking to reporters in Alexandria last night, Dr. 
'Abd-al-Majid affirmed that pan-Arabism has not and will not 
suffer from a setback as a result of ethnic or regional 
fanaticism. Arabs will continue to be Arabs from the ocean to 
the Gulf; they will not experience what other ethnic groups, 
such as those in former Yugoslavia and Mexico, suffered lately, 
he said. 
  'Abd-al-Majid described today's meeting between Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton as a 
very important event. He expects that meeting to help reach a 
peaceful settlement and resolve problems between Israel and both 
Syria and Lebanon. He affirmed Arab League support for Syria 
and Lebanon and underlined the need for Israel to withdraw from 
the Golan and south Lebanon. 
  Touching on Egyptian-Sudanese relations, the secretary 
general stressed the need to resolve the two countries' border 
dispute through dialogue. He said that Egypt is eager to have 
good relations with Sudan and to preserve Sudan's unity and 
avoid the separation of the south from the north. He remarked 
that the problem in southern Sudan requires solution to be 
reached through dialogue, while keeping foreign hands off the 
region. 
  Commenting on the Lockerbie issue, 'Abd-al-Majid remarked 
that the legal aspects of the case are in Libya's favor, because 
it is not obliged to hand over its citizens for trial in another 
state with which it has no extradition agreement. 
Unfortunately, he said, the political aspect of the case is 
dominated by the UN Security Council's escalatory measures. The 
risk lies in a possible oil ban against Libya, he remarked.

  [Text] Alexandria, 16 Jan (MENA)-- Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has affirmed that the new stage 
in the new world order demands restoring Arab solidarity, 
restoring confidence in Arab relations, and achieving economic 
integration in order to seriously and objectively deal with the 
changes that are taking place in international political and 
economic relations. 
  Speaking at a meeting with members of the Businessmen's 
Association in Alexandria last night, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said 
that the Arab nation possess economic, human, and cultural 
resources that would enable it to carry out an effective role in 
the new world order. As a regional organization, the Arab 
League can play an effective role in most major issues facing 
the Arab world. 
  He added that the Arab League dealt objectively with the 
Gulf 
crisis in 1990. It views the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles as an important turning point in the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. The Arab League also welcomes the efforts to 
establish a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and 
supports the Arab states participating in the peace process. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid pointed out that the Arab position on a 
peaceful settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict is based on the 
implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions in this 
regard and emphasizes the principle of land for peace, the right 
of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to return, 
and on the Arabism of Jerusalem. 
  He added that there is a need for progress on the 
Israeli-Syrian, Israeli-Jordanian, and Israeli-Lebanese tracks 
in order to establish confidence and advance the peace process. 
Israel must realize that it will be the primary beneficiary 
from peace and stability in the Middle East. 
  Regarding the Middle East economic market, the Arab League 
secretary general affirmed that the establishment of such a 
market does not frighten the Arabs, because peace with Israel 
does not mean it will have any economic advantage over the 
Arabs. Israel will be dealt with according to criteria and 
controls established by each state according to its national 
interest. Each Arab state enjoys full sovereignty and will not 
be forced to deal with Israel. 
  He said that any Middle East arrangement to which Israel is 
a 
party must not be at the expense of Arab relations. Regional 
cooperation in the Middle East will not necessarily be confined 
to the Arab states and Israel, but might extend to other states 
in the region, such as Iran, Turkey, and Cyprus. Therefore, the 
Middle Eastern market will be a free trade area involving 
reduced customs barriers, with each state maintaining its own 
customs policy. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Arab boycott of Israel was 
imposed for certain reasons, and when these reasons cease to 
exist, the Arab states can consider ending the boycott. 
  Referring to the GATT agreement and its effects on the Arab 
states, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid affirmed the need for the Arabs to 
deal with this issue with full understanding and awareness. The 
Arabs must also achieve economic integration so as to protect 
Arab national security. He called for Arab reconciliation as a 
prerequisite for restoring Arab solidarity and achieving the 
aspirations and ambitions of the Arab nation. 
  He said that the restoration of Arab solidarity is 
accomplished by respecting the Arab states' independence, 
territorial integrity, and sovereignty over their resources, and 
by noninterference in their internal affairs. It will also be 
necessary to close the file of the Gulf crisis and begin 
establishing an Arab security structure to achieve stability and 
national security by intrinsic means. There must be guarantees 
that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait will not be repeated. The Arab 
League must be provided with the necessary means to resolve Arab 
conflicts by peaceful means. He said that this requires that 
serious consideration be given to amending the Arab League 
Charter by adding annexes to it and establishing an Arab court 
of justice. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid also spoke about the Arab League's role in 
solving the Libyan-Western crisis, the problem of Iran's 
occupation of three islands belonging to the United Arab 
Emirates, solving the Somali problem, and efforts to end the 
problem of Kuwaiti prisoners and missing in Iraq and solve the 
problems facing the Iraqi people as a result of the sanctions 
imposed on them.

  [Text] Ambassador 'Adnan 'Imran, assistant secretary 
general of the Arab League for political affairs, has emphasized 
that the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva has achieved a positive 
shift in the Arabs' favor that must be consolidated in the next 
round of talks in Washington. 
  He said that the 12th round [of Arab-Israeli talks] will be 
a 
final test of Israel's commitment to peace and of the United 
States' ability to carry out its responsibilities and 
commitments. This, he added, is directly linked not only to 
security and stability in the Middle East but to the United 
States' future relations with the countries in the region. 
  In statements made today on the outcome of the 
al-Asad-Clinton summit, he said that Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad was able to rearrange the Arab-Israeli conflict and link 
all the tracks in an attempt to achieve a comprehensive 
solution, which U.S. President Clinton affirmed at the end of 
the summit. 
  Peace, as viewed by the Syrian president, involves not only 
the Syrian track but the Lebanese and Jordanian tracks and the 
legitimate Palestinian rights. Thus, we can say that the issue 
has regained its balance and comprehensiveness.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Afghan President Offers Conditional </F>
Cease-fire"] 
  [Text] Kabul, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Afghan interim 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani yesterday confirmed that he is 
willing to negotiate a cease-fire with his main adversary 
Golboddin Hekmatyar provided the latter breaks off his alliance 
with Uzbek militia leader 'Abdol Rashid Dostam. Rabbani has 
also offered to resign as leader of Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic 
Society of Afghanistan] in favor of former Defense Minister 
Ahmad Shah Mas'ud. 
  According to unconfirmed reports, Rabbani had in the 
beginning wanted to resign from his official post and also leave 
the country but Mas'ud prevented him from doing so and the 
interim president is now under Mas'ud's protection in one of the 
latter's strongholds in the capital. A spokesman for Rabbani, 
however, has denied that he wanted to flee or that he is now 
Mas'ud's prisoner. Rabbani yesterday appeared briefly outside 
Kabul to receive Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's envoy. 
  Rabbani's cease-fire offer was made through a Pakistani 
mediator who later met with Hekmatyar at his headquarters some 
30 km from Kabul, but Hekmatyar, who is interim prime minister 
until 21 March, rejected Rabbani's offer and swore to continue 
the fighting "until the downfall of those who seized power 
illegally." The two sides yesterday threw everything they had 
into the battle for Kabul, targeting hospitals, schools, 
mosques, and market places as part of a strategy to terrorize 
the population. 
  Five of Kabul's 11 districts are under the control of the 
pro-Rabbani forces, three under the control of the Shiites who 
are allied with Iran, and only one under the control of the 
Uzbeks. Control of the remaining two districts south and east of 
the capital changed hands several times in the current battles. 
Sources close to Mas'ud say that he is confident that he can 
drive the Uzbeks out of their Bala Hesar stronghold. 
  A spokesman for Dostam, however, said yesterday that the 
Uzbeks in that area had enough arms and ammunition to "wipe out 
half of Kabul" before surrendering. 
  He added that "Mas'ud has seen nothing yet. We can blow him 
up along with everything he controls in the capital." The two 
camps launched air attacks particularly on civilian targets in 
the capital and surrounding areas. Elsewhere in the country the 
situation was relatively calm with the exception of some 
sporadic fire in Mazar-e Sharif, the country's second largest 
city. 
  The forces dispatched by Mas'ud and his ally Isma'il Khan, 
governor of Herat, to attack the Uzbeks in the north have made 
major advances without any significant resistance. That may be 
because Dostam does not have enough forces to fight on three 
fronts or it may be that he wants to lure the forces of Mas'ud 
and his ally into his own territory before attacking them.

  [Text] Clashes among belligerent groups in some areas of 
Afghanistan are still continuing, but according to reports a 15 
member council comprising military commanders from the jihadi 
parties have started extensive efforts to end the fighting. 
Here is our colleague with the latest Afghan developments. 
  [Correspondent, reporting from Peshawar] Despite the 
reduction in the severity of the battles in Kabul, reports 
coming from northern Afghanistan indicate that there has been 
heavy fighting between the forces supporting and opposing the 
president in Konduz and Samangan provinces. Sources affiliated 
to the Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society] say that in those two 
areas they have achieved some victories and are preparing for a 
new assault against Mazar-e Sharif. 
  On the other hand Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party] sources said 
today that forces opposing the government have taken the town of 
Qal'eh-Zal in Konduz Province and are advancing toward the 
important city of Shir Khan Bandar. 
  Meanwhile a 15 member delegation comprising military 
commanders from five Afghan jihadi parties, which met with 
Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar in Charasyab, has 
stated that the Jami'at-e Eslami party has given it absolute 
authority to arbitrate and decide on the current fighting and 
the means to end it. 
  On the other hand Hezb-e Eslami sources stressed today that 
it and the other groups opposed to the government have 
categorically dismissed the principle of arbitration and 
decisionmaking by the aforementioned commanders. This came 
today when, according to reports in Jalalabad, the 15-member 
military commanders council from five jihadi parties, situated 
in the east of the Afghan capital, called on the warring sides 
in Kabul to cease fire from tomorrow morning and recall their 
forces from the battlegrounds in Kabul. The representatives of 
the Jabha-ye Nejat-e Meli-ye [National Liberation Front], Hezb-e 
Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic Unity Party], Hezb-e Harakat-e Eslami 
[Islamic Movement Party] led by Ayatollah Mohseni, and the 
Mahaz-e Melli [National Front] party are not among the 
commanders who have put forward that proposal. 
  Meanwhile, Homayun Jarid, deputy leader of the Hezb-e 
Eslami, 
announced that a four member delegation from the government 
opposition front -- the Afghan Coordination Council -- will 
arrive in Peshawar today from Charasyab, 25 km south of Kabul, 
to meet and confer with the Pakistani foreign minister and other 
officials as well as a group of the Afghan jihadi group leaders.

  [Text] Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of

that suggested a 15-member council should mediate between the 
warring factions in Afghanistan. 
  According to an IRNA report, the Hezb-e Eslami spokesman 
said: Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami considers this proposal as an 
effort to create a rift between Afghanistan's Jihadi groups. 
  Furthermore, the Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami-e [Islamic Unity 
Party of Afghanistan] spokesman in Peshawar told IRNA: The 
resolution of the Afghan problem can only be accomplished by 
agreement among the four major parties in that country; that is 
Hezb-e Eslami, Hezb-e Wahdat, Jonbesh-e Shomal [the Northern 
Movement] and Rabbani's Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society of 
Afghanistan].

<F P=106> [By Qaiser Butt; all quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] The Afghan prime minister, Eng. Gulab Din Hekmatyar, 
has said that he is ready to accept Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto as a mediator to settle his dispute with President Prof. 
Borhanoddin Rabbani. However, he made it clear that Rabbani 
would have to resign as the president of Afghanistan. 
  Hekmatyar who is also chief of the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic 
Party] Afghanistan, expressed his willingness to respond in 
positive terms to Islamabad's reported initiative for the 
settlement of his dispute with President Rabbani, during an 
interview with THE FRONTIER POST, at his stronghold Charasyab 
(four miles) in Kabul on Wednesday [12 Jan]. 
  To a question about the war situation in Kabul, Hakmatyar 
said that his men had inflicted heavy losses on the Rabbani 
forces. "War will continue till President Rabbani accepts our 
four demands", he declared. 
  Hekmatyar is demanding the resignation of President Rabbani, 
with the offer that he would also reciprocate. The second 
demand pertains to the establishment of an interim government in 
Kabul which, he said should replace the government of President 
Rabbani. "The proposed interim government should be acceptable 
to all the Afghan parties", Hekmatyar explained. The interim 
government, he demanded, should raise a national army within six 
months and all the Afghan parties should surrender their arms 
and ammunition to the ministry of defence. 
  "The interim government should hold general elections as 
soon 
as the national army is raised", is the fourth demand of 
Hekmatyar to end the ongoing war in Kabul and other parts of the 
country. 
  Hekmatyar further said that he would not seek any office in 
the proposed interim government. "I am not interested in the 
prime minister's office nor do I want to be the president", 
Hekmatyar added. "I will not accept anything, but elections. 
  He rejected the allegations that he was responsible for the 
on-going war and said that president Rabbani was responsible for 
it who, he said, was trying to have a one-party system in 
Afghanistan. "It is not only the Hezb-e Eslami fighting against 
president Rabbani's Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society] and his 
former defence minister Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's Shoora-e Nazar." 
  The Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party] of Ayatollah Mazari 
and Junbish-e Milli of Gen. Rashid Dostam are also the two major 
parties fighting against Rabbani and Mas'ud. Hekmatyar said 
adding "The Hezb-e Wahdat and Junbish-e Milli had been a part of 
Rabbani's set-up till last month. 
  Replying to a question about the allegations by President 
Rabbani that communists were helping Hekmatyar in the war, the 
Afghan premier said that by saying so Rabbani had weakened his 
own case. "It is a known fact that Gen. Rashid Dostam whom 
Rabbani was now calling as a communist had been one of his close 
associates in government for 20 months. "Rabbani himself 
declared that Gen. Dostam and other communists were part of the 
Islamic army." Rabbani visited Gen. Dostam five times during 
his 20-month rule. "It is also a known fact that a top 
communist general Momin who was killed in war was fighting from 
Rabbani's side. 
  Hekmatyar said that Rabbani could not mislead the people of 
Afghanistan merely with such propaganda as everyone in and 
around Afghanistan was aware that all the top communists of 
Afghanistan such as Babtak Karmal, Gen Nabi Azeemi, Mahm'ud 
Bityali, Gen Baba Jan, Farid Mazdak and Kavyani were 
masterminding the policies of Rabbani's government. 
  Giving datails of his differences with president Rabbani 
which ultimately led to the current bloody war in Afghanistan, 
the Afghan prime minister said that Rabbani was suppossed to 
hold general elections in six months after becoming the 
president of the country under the Islamabad accord. 
  "I had to accept the office of the prime minister under the 
Islamabad accord despite my reservations but Rabbani did not 
honour the accord even for a single day. He did not hand over 
the prime minister's secretariat to me and the secretariat 
building continued to remain under the control of Jami'at-e 
Eslami fighters. President Rabbani rejected all the decisions 
taken by my cabinet without any reason. The cabinet decision 
that Afghan currency will no longer be printed in Moscow was not 
implemented by president Rabbani for the reason that Moscow was 
keen on helping him with this currency. All such Afghan 
currency was printed without any reserves as Rabbani joined 
Moscow to destroy the Afghan economy. Rabbani failed to restore 
peace in Afghanistan during his 20 month rule in Kabul as was 
expected by him. "Kabul suffered 25 big fights during his 
rule", Hekmatyar said. 
  He added: "On our requests Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia 
asked Rabbani to let the Islamabad accord be implemented but he 
did not listen to anyone. He refused to listen to all of those 
who wanted the return of peace to Afghanistan." 
  Hekmatyar also said that president Rabbani during his 20 
month rule continuously instigated one party against the other. 
He formally asked Gen Rashid Dostam to attack Hezb-e Eslami but 
he refused. "Rabbani depended on Gen Dostam to perpetuate his 
illegal rule but he refused to be a party with him any more when 
he realised that Rabbani was trying to have one party rule in 
Afghanistan. "Rabbani praised Gen. Dostam so long as he was 
with him but as soon as he refused to be a tool in his hands he 
declared him as a communist. Rabbani is on record as having 
said on several occasions that Gen Dostam played a key role in 
the removal of communist president Gen Najibollah," he said. 
  Hakmatyar added: "It was Rabbani who failed to keep his 
allies. Hezb-e Wahdat, Junbish-e Milli [the National Movement] 
and Afghan National Liberation Front [ANLF] of Prof. 
Sibghatollah Mojaddedi with him as he did not fulfill the 
promises he made with them." 
  He said that Hezb-e Eslami was the first to realise that 
Rabbani and Mas'ud were playing in the hands of the communists. 
Hekmatyar said this while giving details of the formation of a 
combined force with Hezb-e Wahdat, Junbish-e Milli and ANLF. 
  Hezb joined us when its leadership realised that Rabbani was 
responsible for instigating Hazara tribe against the Pukhtoons, 
Uzbeks against the Pukhtoons, and Shlee against Sunnis. 
"Similar were the feelings of Gen Dostam when he also decided 
to be with us against Rabbani and Prof. Sigbhatollah Mojaddrdi 
agreed with all of us". Hekmatyar said that the current 
conflict would prove as the final round of war in Kabul against 
those who were not willing to honour the rule of people.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by correspondent Darestani from Islamabad] </F>
  [Text] After meeting with the conflicting sides in 
Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic's special envoy to Afghanistan 
has returned to Peshawar, Pakistan. 
  During his three-day visit to Kabul, Taherian conveyed a 
verbal message from President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to Afghan 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani and handed a written message from 
Foreign Minister Velayati to Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin 
Hekmatyar. He also held talks with Mazari, secretary general of 
the Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party] and the high-ranking 
representative of Afghanistan's national-Islamic movement in 
Kabul. 
  In an interview this morning, he stated that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran is doing its best to bring together the heads 
of the conflicting sides in order to achieve understanding and 
that it is giving attention to consultations with our neighbors 
in this. The Islamic Republic's special envoy to Afghanistan 
added: 
  [Begin Taherian recording] Following the contacts, the 
conflicting sides agreed to name representatives, who will start 
meeting as soon as possible. But it may be too soon yet to make 
any assessment of this. We intend, God willing, to continue our 
efforts aimed at achieving results and we hope that, God 
willing, we will achieve something specific. [end recording] 
  Taherian said in conclusion that in continuation of his 
mission he will start meetings with Pakistani officials today so 
that views can be exchanged between officials of the two 
countries on how to end the battles in Afghanistan and to 
promote understanding among the conflicting sides.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Afghan Factions Reject Pakistani </F>
Initiative and Escalate Fighting"] 
  [Excerpt] Kabul, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The warring 
Afghan factions yesterday rejected a Pakistani peace initiative 
and pledged to continue the fighting "until complete victory." 
  The aim of the Pakistani initiative, which was supported by 
the United States and Russia, was to make arrangements for an 
unconditional cease-fire to be followed by peace talks in 
Islamabad within one week. 
  A spokesman for 'Abdol Rashid Dostam said that there would 
be 
no cease-fire agreement before interim President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani resigns and leaves the country. 
  Interim Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, whose Hezb-e 
Eslami Party and Dostam's Uzbek militias are now allies, 
supported Dostam's position. 
  There was no categorical rejection of the Pakistani 
initiative by the opposing side led by former Defense Minister 
Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, but a spokesman for Mas'ud said that Dostam 
would be excluded from any future talks and that Hekmatyar would 
be invited as a faction leader and not as interim prime minister. 
  There was fierce fighting in Kabul yesterday in which 
missiles and aircraft were used. [passage omitted]

minister and minister of finance and planning Nasir al-Rawdan 
said today that oil revenues between 1 July 1993 and the end of 
last year reached 1.235 billion Kuwaiti dinars whereas nonoil

presented by al-Rawdan to the National Assembly on the economic 
situation in Kuwait, on problems and challenges facing it, and 
recommondations that might boost the economy. 
  The report predicted, however, that Kuwait's oil revenues 
could be as much as 944 million dinars during the next six 
months presuming output would remain at two million barrels per 
day and at an average of $10.50 per barrel. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Muscat, Jan 14 (AFP) -- Oman's ruler, in a 
face-to-face chat with his people, has urged them not to be lazy 
and prepare to take over jobs from foreigners as the Gulf state 
presses on with a nationalisation drive. 
  Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id said around 400,000 jobs taken up by 
Asians and other expatriates were awaiting Omanis and asked 
local religious and tribal leaders to encourage young men to 
engage in work. 
  Qabus, whose speech was broadcast on state-run Omani 
television Thursday night, said foreigners accounted for 26 
percent of the population and the government wanted to cut the 
level to 10 percent. 
  "It is time for serious work. Let us work together to 
achieve that objective," he told Omanis in an outdoor meeting, 
part of his annual meet-the-people tour in remote areas of the 
Sultanate. 
  "I have information that the majority of Omanis are aged 
under 15 years. This means that the youth are coming... There 
are at least 400,000 jobs occupied by expatriates and are 
awaiting the Omani youth." 
  Qabus, 48, rejected excuses by Omanis that they could not 
find jobs because they did not have academic qualifications. He 
said jobs in farming and other traditional sectors that were the 
main living source before oil was discovered did not require 
such qualifications. 
  "Educational qualifications are not the ultimate goal. It is 
training and rehabilitation. There are certain types of work 
that do not need many qualifications. Farms and other 
facilities inherited from our ancestors are still there and 
testify for their capabilities," he said. 
  "Those who make such excuses are lazy. Only lazy people make 
excuses. We all must not listen to these people and we all must 
say to them: no." 
  Qabus said his government was chalking out an intensive 
training programme for Omanis so they will replace foreigners, 
who began to stream in when oil was discovered around 20 years 
ago. 
  Oman produces around 800,000 barrels per day of oil and its 
crude reserves exceed 4.5 billion barrels. It has used the oil 
wealth, which fetches it more than three billion dollars a year, 
to build a modern infrastructure and turn its barren territory 
and mudhouses into a green spot and large buildings. 
  Other oil-rich Gulf states depend heavily on foreign labour 
given a large shortage in skilled native labour. But they have 
joined Oman in launching campaigns to lessen reliance on 
expatriates, which they believe have become a threat to their 
security and conservative tribal society. 
  Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have the biggest 
percentage of foreigners, who have become a majority. But the 
Iraq invasion has prompted measures in Kuwait to turn its local 
population into a majority by expelling some expatriates and 
restricting entry visas. 
  "The Omanisation programme is moving ahead," Qabus told his 
citizens, who flanked him as he sat on the ground. "Shaykhs and 
dignitaries are asked to urge the youth to engage in work. This 
encouragement is their most important duty." 
  Qabus, who joined other regional states in creating a 
consultative body after the Gulf war, said he was planning to 
revise representation in the council according to the size of 
population in the provinces. 
  "Representation in the consultative council will be 
proportionate with the population density. The distribution 
will be fair," he said.

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, 15 Jan -- His Excellency Mr. Ronald 
Brown, the U.S. secretary of commerce, and his delegation, 
arrived today in Riyadh on a visit to the Kingdom. 
  His excellency was welcomed at King Khalid International 
Airport by his excellency Dr. Sulayman al-Salim, the minister of 
trade. [passage omitted] 
  On his arrival, his excellency the secretary of commerce 
made 
a statement in which his excellency expressed his pleasure at 
visiting the Kingdom which is the first leg in a one-week tour 
in the Middle East. 
  Here follows the statement of his excellency, the secretary 
of commerce: 
  [Brown] [passage omitted] This week, I will also be visiting 
Jordan, Egypt, Israel, and the West Bank. My mission is aimed 
at encouraging economic development and commercial relations 
which will help stability in this region, create economic 
variety in the Arab Gulf, expand commercial relations between 
the United States and Saudi Arabia, and consolidate the peace 
process. [passage omitted] 
  The economic strategy of the Clinton administration is based 
on fledgling and changing markets such as in Saudi Arabia and 
the Gulf countries. We believe that these markets have got a 
huge potential to develop in coming years. Moreover, it is 
important to reach a wide-ranging shift toward a free trade 
policy between the United States and GCC countries, whose 
officials I will meet tomorrow. 
  There are a number of U.S. companies eager to conclude 
partnerships with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries, while 
these Gulf countries are aspiring to diversify their economies, 
which are based on oil. The proceedings of dialogue I am to 
open tomorrow will focus upon reducing the number of barriers to 
build more sound commercial relations between our two countries, 
reducing tariff barriers and expanding protection of cultural 
heritage. All these are naturally among our priorities. 
  During my meetings with the Saudi leadership, I am hoping to 
have talks that will strengthen commercial relations between the 
United States and Saudi Arabia. [passage omitted] Thank you, 
and I am now ready to hear your questions. [end Brown] 
  In reply to a question aircraft which Saudi Arabia was 
intending to buy from the United States, his excellency Mr. 
Ronald Brown indicated that during his visit to the Kingdom last 
May his excellency spent a long time discussing with Saudi 
Government officials commercial interests between the two 
countries. His excellency said: "One of the issues raised then 
was the purchase of aircraft and this issue is going to be 
included in our agenda during this visit." His excellency added 
that his excellency was happy with the progress achieved on the 
subject. [passage omitted] 
  His excellency further said: "We see an enlargement of 
participation in this agreement and in view of our close 
relationship and strong economic and commercial links with Saudi 
Arabia, we see the latter joining in." His excellency indicated 
that specific questions were raised concerning the Kingdom and 
his excellency expressed his confidence that these questions 
would be settled. His excellency added: "These are some of the 
items we will discuss during my visit." [passage omitted] 
  His excellency also described his previous visit to Saudi 
Arabia as great and said: "This is why I returned to visit the 
Kingdom after only eight months. This highlights the importance 
the United States attaches to its relations with Saudi Arabia." 
[passage omitted] 
  His excellency further said: "I believe progress has been 
achieved as regards our trade relations. This has been done 
with the promotion of joint solidarity projects, U.S. 
investments, and improvement of trade relations between the two 
countries." 
  In reply to a question on where U.S. companies were going to 
win procurement bids for expansion and development of 
telecommunications networks in the Kingdom, his excellency 
pointed out that his excellency would follow up these matters 
with his excellency the Saudi minister of telegraph, posts, and 
telephone and his excellency the Saudi minister of commerce. 
His excellency added: "Naturally, we would be pleased if U.S. 
companies were successful in bids for those procurements."

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement issued at the end of the meetings of </F>
the Yemeni Political Forces Dialogue Committee in Aden on 18 
January] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. A final statement issued by the political forces 
dialogue committee on 18 January 1994: 
  Praise be to God with whose blessings good deeds are done, 
guidance is obtained, and success is achieved. May God's peace 
be upon the prophet of love, brotherhood, and peace and upon his 
family, companions, and followers. 
  O patient Yemeni people: The greatness of any people is best 
seen in times of hardship and their cultural traits do not stand 
out except when the approach they follow to remedy crises and 
the methods they use to address and overcome their effects are 
known. 
  In light of the political crisis the country is 
experiencing, 
and when even the most optimistic people were waiting for the 
moment when the situation would explode, the Yemeni people were 
wagering on their patience, endurance, and ability to overcome 
and end the ordeal. After relying on God, the Yemeni people 
pinned all their hopes on the dialogue going on between their 
political forces. 
  O great people: The wisdom of your sons who are holding the 
dialogue was confirmed and the wager of your enemies was 
defeated. God has granted success to your political forces in 
the battle of the greater jihad, the jihad of psyches. Reason 
has had the upper hand in the dialogue, whims were defeated, and 
everybody reached an agreement in which the devil alone was the 
loser and the people were the winner. This agreement is in the 
public interest. Its essence and spirit is the building of a 
just, democratic society that believes in progress and in which 
there is no place for injustice, oppression, violence, 
despotism, monopolies of power and wealth, violations of the 
constitution and laws, or violations of human rights. 
  The dialogue committee has reached full agreement on a 
historic document that represents an important juncture in the 
march of the Yemeni struggle for freedom and progress. This 
document strongly bolsters a wise Yemeni approach based on 
rejection of all forms of violence and adoption of dialogue as 
the only way to settle differences. 
  The Document of Pledge and Agreement covers the overall 
military, security, and political foundations that allow for the 
establishment of a modern state with institutions capable of 
development and of achieving prosperity and addressing the 
people's concerns and problems. This state is also founded on 
democracy, the peaceful rotation of power, and the broad 
participation of the society on the basis of financial and 
administrative decentralization. 
  O great Yemeni people: Experience has taught us that 
violence only breeds destruction and that any concession we make 
at the dialogue table is stronger and greater than any gains 
made over a heap of bodies and a river of blood. 
  While declaring the points it had reached and which were 
agreed on by all the political forces taking part in the 
dialogue, the Political Forces Dialogue Committee thanks all 
brothers and friends who have shown sympathy toward Yemen's 
crisis and expressed willingness to cooperate. The dialogue 
committee also expresses its appreciation for the Yemeni people, 
who have been observing its steps and who have supported its 
work through their popular conferences. The dialogue committee 
urges every Yemeni, who loves his country and cares for his 
future and the future of his children, to support the 
committee's decisions and to cooperate to achieve those 
decisions. Each Yemeni should also bravely side with the 
well-intentioned forces that uphold justice, right, and public 
interests. Each Yemeni should firmly oppose -- by adopting all 
democratic methods -- all forces of evil harboring bad 
intentions for Yemen. 
  The dialogue committee further urges all the sons of the 
Yemeni people, civilian and military, to spread a spirit of 
love, brotherhood, and tolerance. It also urges them to support 
the agreement it has reached and to reject any attempt to use 
any method, be it political or military, that aims at 
undermining or departing from the agreement. 
  While declaring its finalization of this historic document 
by 
the second deadline it had announced, the dialogue committee 
will continue to make preparations for a meeting between 
political leaders during which the national document shall be 
baptized. During this meeting agreement will be reached on 
guarantees to implement the accord and an announcement will be 
made on the beginning of its implementation and the Yemeni 
people's transition to a stage of construction and progress 
under the canopy of love, peace, unity, democracy, a state of 
law and order, and respect for human rights. 
  We ask God for success and guidance. We also pray to him not 
to lead us astray after he has given us guidance. 
  [Signed] The Political Forces Dialogue Committee 
  [Dated] 18 January 1994

  [Text] The Political Forces Dialogue Committee concluded 
its meetings in Aden, the economic and trade capital, yesterday 
by endorsing the Document of Pledge and Accord to build the new 
Yemeni state. The document was reached through an agreement 
among all parties participating in the dialogue. 
  This national document covers the following important issues 
covered by the political forces dialogue: 
  The accused in disorder cases: 
  The document calls for firm measures to arrest fugitive 
suspects in cases of assassinations, assassination attempts, and 
highway robberies, and in other security violations. It also 
calls for immediate legal and public trials for those arrested 
in order to implement legal measures and penalties against the 
accused without delay. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee 
opposes any leniency or hesitation on the part of the competent 
forces to take firm legal measures against those involved in 
terrorist acts. It affirms the need to expeditiously issue the 
regulations governing the carrying of firearms, ensure 
compliance with them, and review the current law to make it 
tougher in order to limit arms carrying, arms proliferation, and 
arms trade, and to make sure that there are no camps or centers 
for terrorist training as well as to take the appropriate 
measures regarding this. 
  Regarding the security and military aspect, the document 
affirms the need to remove all checkpoints inside and outside 
the cities, whether these checkpoints are affiliated with the 
Interior Ministry, Defense Ministry, or both ministries. The 
Interior Ministry will be responsible for defining the places in 
which security interests require security points, provided that 
it cooperates with the Defense Ministry to define the joint 
military and security checkpoints. 
  The document also calls for general reconciliation among 
tribes to stop Yemeni bloodshed. In accordance with this 
reconciliation, no acts of revenge will be taken, and anyone who 
takes revenge will be considered an outlaw. The competent state 
organizations will take firm legal measures against these 
outlaws and will define the cases -- which would prompt revenge 
-- which took place before the date on which the declaration was 
issued. The military units -- which were stationed in the 
outskirts in some areas in the Governorates of Ta'izz, Lahij, 
Abyan, Shabwah, al-Bayda', and Ma'rib -- will be redeployed in 
areas agreed upon by a technical committee from the Armed 
Forces. No military patrols will be deployed in the cities, or 
along the roads. The police will be in charge of this in 
accordance with security requirements. An intelligence organ 
will be established in accordance with the law that will define 
its structure, tasks, and powers to safeguard national 
sovereignty. The document calls for discussing the methods to 
end the unofficial armed presence, including the distribution of 
weapons to citizens under any pretext. Any such act will be 
considered a crime. 
  It calls for reorganizing the Ministry of Interior in a way 
that the various security units, including the central security 
forces, will be incorporated into it, so the ministry will have 
control over them. 
  It calls for the withdrawal of the armed forces from the 
cities, and their redeployment during a period not exceeding two 
months in accordance with a consolidated central plan to 
reposition, merge, and reorganize them. 
  It also calls for a commitment not to move any military 
units 
or troop or equipment reinforcements, to suspend the 
implementation of military exercises, and to confine the 
military police's role to that of keeping the security and 
promoting the discipline of military units. The military police 
will be prevented from carrying out any activity or patrols 
which conflict with the duties of the public security. Any 
manifestation, or measure, or conduct which would suggest 
distinction or preferential treatment among the armed forces 
personnel will be banned. 
  The officers and soldiers of the armed forces will be 
prevented from intervening in the affairs of both citizens and 
local authorities. They will also be prevented from carrying 
out any activity in their workplaces that would conflict with 
the functions of the judicial and executive authorities. 
  Recruiting, arming, and mobilizing military units, militias, 
the Border Guard, the Popular Guard, and similar units will be 
halted, and the units recently formed will be disbanded. 
  With regard to assessing the relationship and defining the 
powers, the document stresses the need to embody the 
Constitution, laws, and by-laws in practice; to spell out the 
tasks and powers the Presidential Council, its chairman, and its 
vice chairman will enjoy in the course of the performance of 
their constitutional duties; and to reconsider the duties and 
prerogatives of the Presidential Council Office accordingly. 
  The disbursement of public funds outside the purposes 
defined 
in the general budget's current expenditure and development 
expenditure will be banned. There is a need to abide by the 
powers defined for disbursement. The powers regarding 
disbursement for senior state officials will be defined. 
  With regard to the bases of building a modern state and its 
bodies, the dialogue committee affirmed that the major task lies 
in building the state and repairing the problems from the 
previous phase. Our experience since the formation of the 
Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990 has shown that the way of 
running state affairs has been an obstacle to the merger of the 
two former regimes and to building a united state. 
  With regard to the organization of the central authority, 
the 
document explained the following: The House of Representatives 
is the legislative body of the Republic of Yemen, and it is 
elected by the people through secret, free, and direct 
balloting. The Constitution defines the House's powers, duties, 
terms of membership, and its means of nomination and voting. 
  The Consultative Council comprises an equal number of 
members 
representing the local administrative units. These members are 
elected by the governorates' councils. The Constitution defines 
the number of members from each and every administrative unit, 
membership terms, and the method of nomination and voting. 
  The document also defines the tasks and powers of the 
Consultative Council. The document states that the presidency 
of the state constitutes the sovereign power of the state and is 
composed of the Presidential Council, which includes five 
members elected by the House of Representatives and the 
Consultative Council together. The House of Representatives 
elects a president and a vice president from among its members. 
The term of membership of the Presidential Council has been set 
to two electoral terms. The document also identifies the powers 
and tasks of the Council as set by the Constitution. It also 
defines the tasks and powers of the president, the vice 
president, the Presidential Council members, the government, and 
the judiciary. 
  With regard to local government, the document affirms that 
it 
must be based on a new administrative configuration of the 
Republic of Yemen, revoking the existing administrative 
structures and units through which the country will be fully 
merged and all manifestations of partition will disappear. 
  The document of pledge and accord also defines the powers of 
local administration, which shall be based on direct and free 
elections. It also defines financial, administrative, economic, 
social, security, educational, health, and social services. 
  In the field of rebuilding and reorganizing the armed 
forces, 
the document considers the reorganizing of the armed forces one 
of the major issues. The armed forces shall be affiliated 
directly with the government. No side shall be authorized to 
form a military or semi-military force. A general plan shall be 
prepared to rehabilitate, merge, and reorganize the armed forces. 
  In the field of education, the document stresses the need to 
unify school curriculum. The document urges the formation of a 
higher national security council and the identification of its 
tasks. The document also stresses the need to reactivate the 
central audit and control bureau as a body that is independent 
of the executive power. It shall be directly affiliated with 
the legislature. 
  In the field of economy and financial organization, the 
document sets a number of steps aimed at abiding by a general 
state budget that defines expenditures and revenues and 
nourishes the economy in all fields. 
  The document urges abidance by the current Constitution 
until 
it is amended, providing that an action shall be carried out to 
make constitutional amendments within a period of three months 
and not exceeding five months. 
  The document stresses the need to give the government all 
powers and not to interfere in its work in order to enable it to 
execute its tasks. The government shall set timetables to 
accomplish the set tasks within a month. 
  The Political Forces Dialogue Committee shall supervise and 
follow up the implementation of the decisions stipulated by the 
Document of Pledge and Accord between the parties to the 
dialogue of political forces to establish a modern Yemeni state. 
  Regarding the necessary security arrangements and conditions 
to sign the agreement and begin to implement it, the document 
stipulates that a committee should be formed comprising the 
parties to the dialogue. The committee shall make the necessary 
arrangements to provide the required security conditions to sign 
the agreement and establish guarantees for the beginning of 
implementation, in coordination with the president and [word 
indistinct]. A date shall be set in light of the arrangements 
that will be reached. 
  Afterward, the participants to the dialogue of the political 
forces signed the Document of Pledge and Agreement. 
  The meeting also endorsed the formation of a committee to 
follow up on the implementation of the seventh paragraph of the 
pledge document on making preparations and providing security 
conditions to endorse the document in a final manner and to 
specify the guarantees for its implementation. The committee 
comprises the following brothers: 
  Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum; Brigadier General Mujahid 
Abu-Shawarib; 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi; Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Iryani; Jarallah 'Umar; and [first name indistinct] Ahmad 
Jabir, the committee's rapporteur.

<F P=106> [Reports by 'Abdallah Hammudah in Aden and Hammud Munsir in </F>
Sanaa: "Yemeni Exchange of Fire on Former Borders"] 
  [Excerpt] Political sources in more than one Yemeni party 
have revealed that there was an exchange of fire from light and 
medium weapons two days ago between southern and northern 
military units on the old partition borders in the governorates 
of Shabwah and Ma'ribb. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, the sources confirmed 
that the exchange of fire was stopped within hours to avoid an 
eruption of the situation because of the political crisis which 
has prevailed in Yemen for about five months. 
  It is worth noting that these clashes occurred after the 
arrival of three Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] brigades in 
Shabwah from other governorates including Hadramaut. They are 
the 30th Brigade, the Taysir Brigade, and the 'Abbas Brigade. 
They tightened control of the oil area which was a joint area 
between the two Yemens before unity. It was considered "a joint 
investment zone." Oil prospecting and production rights there 
were given to the French company Total which announced the 
discovery of an oilfield last October after the exploratory 
drilling of three wells. 
  While General People's Congress [GPC] sources accused the 
YSP 
of moving these brigades, the YSP claimed that the GPC had moved 
several units from al-Hudaydah to Ta'izz near Aden and 
reinforced its units in the governorates of Ibb and al-Bayda'.

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview with Shaykh 'Abdallah </F>
Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the Yemeni House of 
Representatives and chairman of the Yemeni Reform Grouping 
Higher Committee, by Hammud Munsir in Sanaa and 'Abdallah 
Hammudah and Lutfi Shatarah in Aden; date not given: "Al-Ahmar: 
We Accept What They Impose for the Sake of Unity"] 
  [Excerpts] Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker 
of the Yemeni House of Representatives and chairman of the 
Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG] Higher Committee, has stated that 
"unity is dear to us and we have paid the price for it but now 
they want an additional price." He was referring to the demands 
included in the 18 points submitted by the Yemeni Socialist 
Party [YSP]. He added: "They are imposing things on us; we 
accept, for the sake of unity." 
  This came in an exclusive interview with AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
at 
Shaykh al-Ahmar's home in Sanaa in which he said: "Our view is 
that everything possible has been done but there should be 
agreement on the constitutional amendments." He also said that 
the "points are acceptable (in principle), go in stages, and 
could be carried out by the government." He added: "Out of our 
concern for unity we accept everything they impose, which is a 
bitter pill to swallow." 
  Political sources in Aden have confirmed that Yemeni 
Planning 
and Development Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani has 
resigned in protest against an order issued by Prime Minister 
Eng. Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas calling for discontinuation of 
the Yemeni population and establishments census. Sources close 
to al-Iryani said that he considered that decision to favor 
partition and division. 
  Out of his concern for Yemeni unity, Shaykh al-Ahmar is 
making efforts as speaker of the House of Representatives which 
is the only unity institution still functioning regularly. He 
stressed that he is by no means acting as YRG leader. He said: 
"Responsibility has made it incumbent upon us to be passive and 
not to say what we believe should be said." 
  In reply to a question about views expressed by political 
observers to the effect that the YSP is exerting pressure "for a 
stable state system but is working for a continuation of the 
state of unrest and anticipation for as long as possible to get 
as many concessions as possible," Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar 
said: "Why should we preoccupy ourselves with analysis and 
speculation? The situation is clear. That is the position of 
the (YSP) Political Bureau and Central Committee." 
  Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar emphasized that the decision about 
the state system and whether it should be a parliamentary or 
presidential system "should be a part of the constitutional 
amendments." He added: "We have our own views regarding the 
local councils system which is in harmony with the current 
Constitution, and regarding financial and administrative 
decentralization." 
  On the divisive military movements within the state of 
unity, 
the speaker said: "There have been movements which nobody can 
deny such as the transfer of some units from the eastern areas 
to Shabwah, but there has been no confirmation of other things 
and we hve not heard about them." He reaffirmed the importance 
of preserving unity. He said: "Despite everything, we are 
prepared to come to some understanding with them (the YSP) for 
the sake of unity, which was a precious achievement, dear to us. 
We are prepared to offer many times the sacrifices we have 
already made for its sake." 
  Shaykh al-Ahmar denied that the YRG had "any part in causing 
the crisis." 
  He stressed that "there are no differences within the 
presidency of the House of Representatives. There can be no 
doubt about that. We all work together" because "the House of 
Representatives is the only unity body still functioning, albeit 
with little output." 
  He said that "the Socialist deputies attend and we have had 
no disagreement with them on any measures, because we have not 
reached the point of decision on the measures which should be 
taken and to which the House of Representatives is entitled." 
He said that "the House of Representatives, like other state 
institutions, has been affected by the crisis but we are still 
holding together and there has been no dispute within the 
House." [passage omitted] 
  It should be noted that the prime minister and the ministers 
of defense, oil, transport, and housing, and the deputy prime 
minister for manpower are all in Aden and do not discharge their 
ministerial duties or take part in the cabinet meetings in 
Sanaa. The cabinet holds regular meetings under the 
chairmanship of Dr. Hasan Makki, member of the General Committee 
(Political Bureau) of the General People's Congress [GPC] and 
first deputy prime minister. 
  In reply to a question about the absence of these ministers 
and whether there is justification for withdrawing confidence 
from the cabinet and forming a new cabinet, a YSP source said 
that the reason they have stayed away from Sanaa was the 
discovery of a plan for their assassination. He added that 
senior state officials knew that. [passage omitted]

who were passing through on their way back from Afghanistan. 
They also got their instructions from there. What do you think 
of these confessions? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] With regard to reports of Yemen's connection 
with events inside Egypt, we have often pointed out that Yemen 
will never become a stage for anti-Egyptian activity. We have 
contacted the Egyptian Government to emphasize this. We are 
willing to ban the entry of Egyptians or other nationals who 
have been convicted of such crimes or have any links with them. 
We are willing to increase coordination with Egypt on this. We 
have said that we will welcome any Egyptian delegation sent to 
Yemen to examine reports of the existence of training camps. We 
will give the Egyptian security services the opportunity to 
ascertain the facts for themselves. 
  [Musa] Some parties are planning meticulously for these 
organizations. They enter no country under their real names, 
something that worries all the concerned security services. In 
Yemen, they use noms de guerre and are trained inside 
apartments, not at outdoor camps. 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Nothing like this has been uncovered. No 
camps and no such individuals were found. We have coordinated 
efforts with the Egyptian Interior Ministry and are willing to 
receive Egyptian security officials. We will examine what 
information they have and cooperate with them for the good of 
our two countries. The relevant departments are kept informed 
of our contracts with Egyptian teachers. We will deport any 
individuals staying in Yemen as workers if they are accused of 
anything. 
  [Musa] Suppose the Egyptian security services can prove that 
some terrorists are still inside Yemen, will they be handed over 
to Egypt for trial? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Extradition of individuals is governed by 
pertinent agreements. There are no such agreements between our 
two countries. But we will adopt the necessary measures to 
prevent our country from becoming a center for such activities. 
  [Musa] Is there no intention of concluding new agreements to 
govern this issue, which is vital to our countries' stability? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] I discussed ways of exchanging visits and 
data with Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi on the sidelines of 
the Arab interior ministers conference in Tunis last week. The 
aim is to control the movement of suspect individuals. 
  [Musa] When these individuals arrive from Afghanistan, 
training is carried out inside apartments in Yemen. What is 
your comment on these reports? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Yes, there were such reports. We asked the 
Egyptian security authorities to specify where these apartments 
are and give us information on them in addition to photographs 
of the individuals suspected of such crimes. Our aim is to 
coordinate the work of the security forces in our two countries 
and to be of assistance. 
  [Musa] Yemen has recently been the scene of a series of 
explosions and assassination attempts carried out by groups of 
the al-Jihad Organization "The Returnees from Afghanistan." How 
did the security service identify the culprits and unravel the 
circumstances of various cases? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Our information indicated that the Yemenis, 
who had travelled to Afghanistan, established an organization 
known as "al-Jihad." This organization is financed by 
businessman Usamah Bin-Ladin. Investigations involving the 
defendants in Aden, Lahij, Hadhramaut, and Sanaa showed that 
they are responsible for the terrorist operations against the 
hotels and for the assassination attempts against personalities. 
The investigations have also proven that the perpetrators do 
belong to the al-Jihad Organization and receive instructions 
from one side. We are currently taking the necessary measures 
to refer them to court. 
  [Musa] How many will be charged? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] Some 96 terrorists will stand trial. Some 36 
are in prison and the other 60 are fugitives. 
  [Musa] Do you intend to amend your laws to confront 
terrorist 
crimes, which are alien to your society? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] I have submitted a draft for a new law to 
confront terrorism and carrying arms, because Yemeni law allows 
people to carry arms. This is a serious phenomenon and it's one 
of the factors behind the wave of violence and terrorism. The 
Yemeni citizen can carry licensed arms. He can also own arms 
without a license. 
  [Musa] How many weapons have been seized through your 
ministry? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] We can only seize unlicensed weapons when 
they are found in large quantities. In the most recent case, we 
seized 100 automatic rifles and machine guns. But personal 
weapons are allowed by law. 
  [Musa] The Yemeni security service has thwarted several 
attempts to smuggle weapons. What are the details of these 
attempts? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] We have indeed thwarted many attempts to 
smuggle weapons through coastal borders. We have a good market 
for arms trade. The arms are being sold publicly. We can only 
curb this dreadful trade through new laws, which will be issued. 
We aborted an attempt to unload an arms shipment from a foreign 
ship heading from the north to the south. 
  [Musa] Your Excellency, we know you are pursuing defendant 
Usamah Bin-Ladin for his involvement in the terrorist operations 
in your country. What are the latest developments in his case? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] We have asked Interpol to hunt down 
Bin-Ladin 
and other fugitives and bring them to Yemen on charges of 
involvement in various explosions. 
  [Musa] Do you have any proof of foreign financing? 
  [Al-Mutawakkil] We are still looking for all the main 
sources 
financing terrorism, although all the signs are that Usamah Bin- 
Ladin is the principal financier. 
  [In a note at the bottom of the report, AL-AHRAM states the 
following: "Note: A ranking Yemeni source has revealed that the 
investigation and information confirm that Usamah Bin-Ladin has 
earmarked huge funds to finance the activities of terrorist 
trends in some Arab countries, particularly Egypt, Tunis, 
Algeria, and Yemen. These funds amount to well over .5 billion 
pounds. He is also allocating between $30,000 and $50,000 for 
any operation carried out in these countries."]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report: "The Secret Clauses of the </F>
Syrian-American Agreement; Expected Meeting Between al-Shar' and 
Peres; Syrian Promises To Silence Hizballah and Opposition 
Factions"] 
  [Text] All observers agree that Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad is one of the most skillful players in the Middle East. 
He managed to wrest a great deal from the U.S. Administration 
in return for only a few things which the Syrian leadership 
considers important but not of a priority nature. The Syrian 
president carried with him to Geneva three main files, one on 
Syria's regional role, another on the Syrian role in Lebanon, 
and a third on the Golan Heights. Contrary to the U.S. 
Administration's expectations, the file of the Golan and 
Israel's withdrawal from it was the last and not the first to be 
carried by President al-Asad to his Geneva meeting last Sunday 
[16 January]. 
  Excluding what the Arab and foreign newspapers published, 
AL-BILAD managed to obtain the most important points discussed 
by the two sides--points which were kept secret pending their 
publication at a time appropriate for both the Americans and 
Syrians. These points are: 
  -- A secret American approval of giving the Syrians a free 
hand in Lebanon after obtaining a pledge from President al-Asad 
to guarantee the security of Israel's northern borders and to 
silence the katyushas forever. 
  -- Reactivation of the Syrian role in the region and giving 
Syria a larger regional role after most of the Egyptian cards 
have been exhausted. 
  -- Removal of Syria from the terrorist list following 
Syrian-American talks to be held in Washington for this purpose, 
including a Syrian pledge to liquidate and silence the 
Palestinian factions opposing the peace process forever, 
renounce terrorism, restrict Hizballah movement, and liquidate 
the remnants of the Kurdish Workers Party revolutionaries in 
Syria. 
  -- A clear and explicit Syrian declaration of its acceptance 
of full peace and full normalization and the establishment of 
normal relations with Israel. This will be followed by an 
Israeli recognition of Syrian sovereignty over the Golan 
Heights. Negotiations will then be held on the territory the 
Israelis will hand over to the Syrians in the Golan, along with 
security arrangements appropriate for the Israelis. 
  -- Resumption of the next round of talks in Washington on 24 
January, to be followed by a meeting between the U.S. secretary 
of state and the Syrian foreign minister. A U.S.-sponsored 
meeting between Peres and al-Shar' might be held to sign the 
agenda in the middle of next month. 
  -- Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese 
border 
strip in accordance with the UN resolutions after obtaining a 
written Syrian commitment to guarantee the security of northern 
Israel and provide total security for total peace. 
  These are the most important points that were kept secret 
about al-Asad-Clinton summit. The coming days may reveal more.

<F P=106> [Salwa al-Ustuwani report: "Damascus Circles Talk About </F>
Conditions for Full Normalization"] 
  [Excerpt] Damascus, Amman, Beirut, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- 
Damascus circles hope that the Syrian-U.S. summit held in Geneva 
the day before yesterday will be "the beginning of a new phase 
that leads to returning the land to its owners and hence full 
normalization through the land-for-peace principle, so that the 
region will move to the stage of economic development and 
prosperity." A senior Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
that his country's position and concept of a just and 
comprehensive peace were announced very clearly in Geneva, and 
that the moment of truth has come for Israel to respond to the 
voice of peace, which was announced again from Geneva. 
  The Syrian official was speaking after President Hafiz 
al-Asad's return from Geneva the night before last after his 
historic meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Tahir 
al-Masri, speaker of the Jordanian House of Representatives, 
said the meeting is as important as the Madrid conference from 
which the peace process was launched. Maybe in this context, 
too, Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi spoke to the Syrian 
president over the telephone to agree to hold a summit in 
Damascus, to be attended from the Lebanese side -- in addition 
to President al-Hirawi -- by Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih 
Birri, Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, Foreign Minister Faris 
Buwayz, and Ambassador Suhayl Shammas, head of the peace 
delegation to the negotiations with Israel. 
  A Lebanese presidential source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that 
President al-Asad has asked Lebanese officials to wait two days, 
to allow him to rest after his journey to and from Geneva. He 
will receive them later. However, the source said that, if 
something happens and delays this Lebanese-Syrian summit, Syrian 
Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' will visit Beirut to brief 
officials on the results of the Geneva summit, and the summit 
would then be held later in Damascus. 
  On the significance of the Geneva summit, the Syrian 
official 
told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the U.S. Administration's renewal of 
its commitment -- openly and clearly -- and its intention to do 
all it can to achieve a just and comprehensive peace, is another 
reason for the optimism about achieving the desired peace. 
However the official said that this peace is still surrounded 
by caution, because Israel has not yet expressed its intentions 
regarding commitment to this peace. It is still maneuvering, 
claiming it does not understand the peace proposed by Syria. 
  The official said: How can the United States, in particular 
its President, and the world as a whole understand and support 
what Syria has proposed with regard to peace, while Israel still 
has not understood the Syrian view? Does that not indicate that 
Israel is still acting stubbornly by refusing to accept a peace 
based on the known foundations endorsed by the resolutions of 
international legitimacy? 
  The Syrian official pointed out that Syria, which adhered to 
full sovereignty over the Golan, also clearly adheres to a 
complete Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. This applies 
also to Jerusalem, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the 
Palestinians' rights. This was stressed by President Hafiz 
al-Asad during his talks with President Clinton in Geneva. The 
summit reflected a full U.S. understanding of the Syrian view.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: The entire world has welcomed the 
results of the summit held by Presidents al-Asad and Clinton in 
Geneva, calling this summit a decisive turning point on the path 
to a just and comprehensive Middle East peace. 
  In their statements and news conference, the two presidents 
emphasized an real, honorable peace based on the Security 
Council resolutions and the land-for-peace principle. A real, 
honorable peace is one that ends occupation and secures rights 
for their owners, one that can be accepted by the present 
generation and safeguarded by coming generations. 
  President al-Asad explained that peace is not a phased 
Syrian 
objective but rather a strategic Syrian choice. He also called 
for the peace of the brave. For his part, President Clinton 
announced his support for President al-Asad's call to achieve 
the peace of the brave. 
  Politicians, observers, and media circles throughout the 
world are unanimous in saying that Syria has opened the door for 
peace and has completely paved the way for a just, lasting, and 
comprehensive solution. They are also unanimous in stating that 
the ball is now in Israel's court and that Israel should prove 
in practical terms that it seeks peace by responding to the 
outcome of the Geneva summit. Indeed, U.S. envoys flew to 
Israel directly from this Swiss city, the scene of this year's 
event, in order to explore the extent of Israel's response to 
the outcome of this summit. 
  It is now clear to everyone throughout the world that Syria 
has lived up to the level of the world's aspirations for a 
firmly-established peace in the Middle East, that Syria has made 
far more contributions to the cause of peace than the other 
party, and that peace would have been achieved in the region had 
it been up to Syria alone. However, peace cannot be established 
without Israel's response, which it has yet to give. In the 
Washington talks, Israel employed maneuvers and procrastination 
to create a drain at these talks. Moreover, both the overall 
peace process and the U.S. initiative were almost undermined by 
the conclusion of separate deals. All the events and 
developments have confirmed that such deals are far away from 
peace. 
  In view of such a decisive meeting as the Geneva summit, 
which yielded results drawing support throughout the world, 
Israel has found no other way to evade these results but to cast 
doubts on Syria's peaceful position, invoke feeble security 
pretexts, and call for an Israeli referendum on the Golan issue 
as if the Golan has not always been Syrian territory and as if 
the Israelis can cancel the facts of history and geography. 
  President al-Asad announced at the Geneva summit that 1994 
can be a year of peace in the Middle East if the Israeli rulers 
are courageous enough to respond to the peace of the brave. No 
doubt, he was hinting at the Israeli rulers' known 
prevarications, evasions, and procrastination. The Israeli 
rulers have wasted numerous opportunities to establish a firm 
and comprehensive peace in the region. However, the Geneva 
summit provided a unique and rare opportunity that will 
definitely be lost if the Israeli rulers do not rise to the 
level of the cause of peace, the international community's 
aspirations, the Security Council resolutions, and the 
principles of international law. This opportunity will also be 
lost if these rulers do not realize that full withdrawal from 
the Golan is essential in implementing the Security Council 
resolutions, and that they should end all settlement activities 
and honestly respond to the requisites of a just and 
comprehensive Middle East peace. 
  The Golan is Syrian territory and will remain so. It will 
never be bargained over. Occupation cannot change or undermine 
the Syrian Arab identity of the Golan. Israel's procrastination 
will not yield any result other than wasting this rare 
opportunity, which the Geneva summit has provided, and dashing 
the world's hopes for a firm peace in the region.

<F P=106> [Press review] </F>
  [Text] A commentary by the newspaper TISHRIN addresses 
reactions to the Geneva summit, saying: Politicians, observers, 
and political analysts were unanimous that Syria has clearly and 
favorably responded to all peace requirements, and that the 
Geneva talks have opened all the doors for a true, just, and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The appeal President 
al-Asad has made, urging Israeli rulers to accept the peace of 
the brave, and to make efforts to achieve comprehensive and just 
peace in the region puts Israel to the test, particularly since 
U.S. President Bill Clinton has declared his support for this 
appeal by President al-Asad. Similarly, the U.S. president has 
clearly committed himself to work to achieve just and 
comprehensive peace on the basis of the relevant UN Security 
Council resolutions. 
  TISHRIN adds: The Geneva summit has paved the way for a 
durable peace in the Middle East. However, the materialization 
of such a peace is contingent upon a positive position on 
Israel's part. But, Israeli rulers have chosen to cast doubts, 
voice reservations, and float the idea of holding a referendum 
on the future of the Golan, as if it were not occupied Syrian 
territory. 
  TISHRIN goes on to say: The game of referendum on the Golan, 
which is ostensibly backed by Rabin, is opposed by many. This 
game is designed to circumvent the summit outcome and the 
categorical Syrian-U.S. reaffirmation of efforts to achieve just 
peace in the Middle East. It is a declaration of intent meant 
to evade the requirements of the peace desired by the 
international community. 
  Concluding its commentary, TISHRIN says: President al-Asad 
has repeatedly affirmed, as he did during the Geneva summit, 
that there can be no bargaining over the Golan, and that Syria 
will not cede a single inch of its territory. For peace must 
terminate occupation. Otherwise, it will not have any chance of 
success. Moreover, Syria cannot abandon its territories or 
rights, nor can it bargain over them. As far as the Israeli 
rulers are concerned, peace is close at hand. They could help 
achieve it if they only have the necessary courage, as President 
al-Asad has, indeed, said during the Geneva summit. 
  For its part, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: The Washington 
bilateral talks will be resumed as a result of the Geneva summit 
between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. Israel has again 
returned to the method of maneuvering to thwart the efforts to 
achieve the objective of the peace process, namely, the 
attainment of just and comprehensive peace on the basis of the 
relevant international legitimacy resolutions. Israel's return 
to the methods of maneuvering, procrastination, and word play is 
nothing new. It attempted to belittle the importance of the 
Geneva summit prior to its convocation through a deceptive media 
campaign. Right now, it is attempting to launch a similar 
campaign to dilute its outcome. 
  The paper adds: Israel's initial reaction to the summit 
outcome concerned the Golan. Israel has begun to promote the 
so-called referendum on the Golan under the guise of making 
concessions for peace. 
  The paper wonders: About which concessions is Israel 
talking? For only property owners have the right to make 
concessions. Does Israel own anything on the Golan? Since the 
answer is in the negative, Israel does not have the right to 
claim that it would be making any concessions for peace. Does 
the decision to annex the Golan, which was deemed null and void 
by UN resolutions, give Israel the right to make any such claims? 
  Concluding its commentary, the paper says: It is clear that 
Israel, which has found itself facing an impasse in the 
aftermath of the Geneva summit, still clings to intransigent 
positions on peace. Hence, the bilateral talks, due to resume 
soon, will test Rabin's true intentions. The international 
consensus on peace, which has been manifested in the reactions 
to the Geneva summit, is in line with the need to see stability 
in the region. It is believed that this consensus will not give 
Israel ample room for maneuvering. 
  In a commentary published today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH 
says: The Geneva summit between His Excellency President Hafiz 
al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton is an extremely 
important event. It is a turning point in the region's history. 
Many convictions, misconceptions, and fallacies have been 
removed when faced with the glow of hard facts. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: With an open heart and mind, al-Asad's 
Syria, backed by the entire nation, was in Geneva. Thanks to 
its weight, its special pioneering and historical role, and its 
constant determination to accomplish difficult pan-Arab 
missions, President al-Asad, the man of the hard missions who is 
always willing to make firm and tough decisions, has managed to 
entrench the constant Arab rights, and to make it clear that the 
achievement of a solution is contingent upon the restoration of 
such rights. 
  AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: The peace of the brave leader 
al-Asad has promoted at the Geneva summit is the height of 
loyalty to the sacrifices made by convoys of martyrs. It 
reflects Syria's desire for a just and honorable peace, as well 
as Syria's commitment to work to achieve peace. The appeal 
President al-Asad has made in this regard is a fresh challenge 
to Israeli politicians and rulers, who profess to be advocates 
of peace. Al-Asad has challenged them to adopt credible 
positions. 
  Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: If there is a 
sincere effort to achieve such a peace, there would be no room 
for differing interpretations. Any solution that falls short of 
ensuring the restoration of all occupied Arab territories cannot 
bring peace.

to its members, the wounded and those who are being held in 
Israeli prisons, to liberate all the soil of the south.

  [Text] Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri has revealed 
that an expanded Lebanese-Syrian summit meeting will be held at 
1100 tomorrow. He said that the Geneva Summit has placed the 
key in the lock but we must not be hasty and think that the 
doors have been opened. 
  Speaker Birri met today with Chairman of the Editors 
Association Milhim Karam and the Association Council members. 
He called for maintaining the principles that were established 
at the beginning of the present regime. These are: national 
solidarity, first and foremost; solidarity with fraternal Syria; 
and adherence to UN Security Council Resolution 425. 
  He said that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad has placed the 
ball in the Israeli court, but we must not be overly optimistic. 
He expressed the view that Israel will try to find a way to 
dodge the new U.S. position. 
  After stressing the importance of internal solidarity, he 
maintained that the recent explosions and tension were done 
before the U.S.-Syrian summit to divert attention from the need 
to liberate the occupied border strip and to discuss ways to 
calm the situation. 
  Regarding his holiness the pope's visit to Lebanon, Speaker 
Birri confirmed that this visit will take place and that all 
Lebanese will welcome his holiness the pope because it will 
benefit Lebanon and the Arabs.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Jumayyil: Geneva Summit Aims To </F>
Reactivate Negotiations"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Former [Lebanese] President 
Shaykh Amin al-Jumayyil has said that "the Geneva summit between 
President Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad falls within the 
framework of reactivating the Washington negotiations, which 
have been eclipsed by the Oslo agreement." He added: "Lebanon 
welcomes any meeting that pushes the peace process forward, 
especially the meeting between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad. 
However, one should wait before drawing quick conclusions, 
especially as Israel has a fundamental say in this connection. 
And we have not yet heard any Israeli reaction. 
  "I believe it is our duty to wait in view of the experience 
learned from previous peace initiatives, as only those which 
resulted from direct dialogue between Israel and the other 
party, like al-Sadat's visit to Jerusalem and the Oslo meetings 
between the PLO and Israel, have succeeded." 
  He went on: "In the next weeks or months we should find out 
whether the Geneva agreement was held merely to save face and 
keep Syria in the negotiations, or whether it actually 
represents an advance toward peace. The answer to this question 
will be in the results of the next meetings between Israel and 
Syria." 
  Asked whether Lebanon's fate was discussed in the summit, he 
said: "Any talks on Lebanon's fate that are not conducted by 
the legitimate owners of the house, who are elected freely and 
democratically by the people and who know the internal affairs 
of the house better than anyone else, are not binding on the 
Lebanese people, who will continue to struggle -- no matter how 
long it takes and regardless of the pressures -- to restore 
their free decisionmaking and secure their higher interests."

Someone Else's Role"] 
  [Text] London, AL-HAYAH -- Commenting on the results of the 
Geneva summit held between Presidents Bill Clinton and Hafiz 
al-Asad, former [Lebanese] Prime Minister General Michel 'Awn 
said: "The coming days will show whether the summit talks 
succeeded or failed. However, it is clear that the United 
States will bless the agreement among the parties concerned, but 
it will not be a third party in the dialogue. What it is 
directly interested in is ending terrorist actions in Lebanon, 
and from within." 
  He added: "The Lebanese -- people and officials inside and 
outside -- know that terrorist actions are Syria's 
responsibility, but by different names. From what was said 
about the discussion of the issue of the Kurdish Workers' Party 
[PKK], Hizballah, and the [Ahmad] Jibril group [Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command] it can be 
concluded that Syria was requested not to tackle the unstable 
situation in Lebanon, but to stop it, on the grounds that Syria 
is acting like a fireman who starts a fire so as to extinguish 
it." 
  He went on: "Establishing peace in the region will have a 
positive effect on Lebanon, because this peace means that no one 
should play someone else's role. Every state should play its 
role within its own borders, not outside them. We will continue 
to achieve our aims as regards full sovereignty and good 
relations with our neighbors. Our rights in our homeland are 
fixed and are not wishes or demands." 
  In conclusion, he said: "As for the agents, they have been 
impudent, to the extent that they accuse anyone who talks about 
sovereignty and independence of extremism. They are not ashamed 
of their baseness in dealing with the occupiers."

<F P=106> [Statement by Information Minister Michel Samahah after the </F>
Council of Ministers session in Beirut on 18 January -- recorded] 
  [Text] The Council of Ministers held an extraordinary 
session this afternoon by invitation from the prime minister. 
The president chaired the session. The president opened the 
session by deeply thanking President Hafiz al-Asad for bearing 
the case of Lebanon in his heart and mind at the summit he held 
with President Clinton in Geneva. The subject of Lebanese 
rights took up a large part of this summit, during which 
President Hafiz al-Asad concentrated on the implementation of 
Resolution 425. This was included in President al-Asad's 
statement after the summit. 
  The president also informed the Council of Ministers of the 
contacts he held after the summit with President Hafiz al-Asad. 
The president told the Council of Ministers that this afternoon 
he received the U.S. ambassador in Lebanon, who conveyed a 
message from President Clinton detailing the discussions during 
the summit regarding Lebanon and the future direction of peace 
negotiations in Washington. President Clinton is trying to make 
1994 the year for establishing peace in the region. 
  The Council of Ministers also learned about the contents of 
the telephone conversation between U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher and the prime minister after the Syrian-U.S. 
summit in Geneva ended. 
  In preparation for the Chamber of Deputies discussions of 
the 
1994 budget on Thursday, the minister of state for financial 
affairs presented to the Council of Ministers the budget for 
1994 with the amendments made by the parliamentary Finance and 
Budget Committee. The Council of Ministers discussed all these 
points and approved the amendments made by the Committee.

  [Text] The Lebanese Hizballah revolutionary movement has 
criticized U.S. policies and has accused Washington of catering 
to the Zionist regime's demands. A Central News Unit report 
from Beirut cites the Hizballah secretary general, who said 
yesterday that in continuation of its policies in the Middle 
East the U.S. Government thinks only of the interests of the 
regime occupying Jerusalem and how to meet that regime's demands. 
  Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah described the visit by a delegation 
of 
U.S. Congressmen to Lebanon as an insult to the Lebanese people. 
The Hizballah secretary general said: The United States 
attaches importance only to the fate of a few soldiers of the 
occupying army who disappeared during an attack on Lebanese 
territory, while it pays no attention to the fate of hundreds of 
Lebanese who are living under the most difficult of conditions 
in Zionist prisons.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Gadi Sukenik] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Cabinet ministers are bound 
to rejoice when they are informed of President Clinton's 
message, which was delivered to Prime Minister Rabin on Sunday 
[16 January]. The message says that as of now, Israel may 
participate in U.S. tenders and projects involving the launching 
of space satellites. The license includes access to American 
equipment and expertise. Until now, any such access was denied 
to our hi tech companies. This is a tangible expression of the 
United States' strong commitment to preserving Israel's 
qualitative edge, Clinton wrote in his letter, which was 
delivered by his team of advisers headed by Dennis Ross. 
  It is estimated in Israel that the implementation of this 
decision will create many new jobs, most notably in the Israel 
Aircraft Industries, REFA'EL [Armament Development Authority], 
and the Israel Military Industries.

<F P=106> [Report from Geneva by Gay Bekhor] </F>
  [Excerpts] Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad may today notify 
U.S. President Bill Clinton that Syria will stop supporting 
"elements operating against the peace process," that is, the 
Palestinian and Lebanese terror organizations. Contacts on this 
Syrian announcement have been held since last night at the 
Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva. This was told to HA'ARETZ by 
a Lebanese diplomat in Geneva. The announcement reportedly will 
be handed over to the Americans today, but will not be 
publicized. 
  According to the Lebanese diplomat, the Syrians have 
prepared 
an initial draft stipulating that they "will suspend or stop 
supporting elements operating against the peace process." The 
Americans, however, are demanding a more detailed and explicit 
commitment, including mentioning Hizballah by name. In return, 
the State Department may strike Syria off the list of terror 
supporting countries. [passage omitted] 
  The Lebanese diplomat estimated that the Syrian-Israeli 
rapprochement will be similar to the Israel-PLO mutual 
recognition, which followed 'Arafat's public renouncement of 
terrorism. The Lebanese diplomat believes this will be the main 
achievement of the summit, which is to be held this morning at 
the Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva. The meeting is scheduled 
to last some three hours. A joint news conference may be held at 
the end of the meeting.

  [Text] Academics from Israel and Syria who met recently in 
Oslo worked out a nonbinding document of understanding which 
they have conveyed to the prime minister's bureau in Jerusalem 
and to President al-Asad's office in Damascus. Those who 
participated on the Israeli side were reserve Brigadier General 
'Amos Gilbo'a and Dr. Yosi Olmert. On the Syrian side, there 
was Professor 'Aziz Shukri, dean of the Law Faculty at the 
University of Damascus, and another professor whose name was not 
given. 
  Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the document says 
that Syria agrees to peace with Israel based on the Egyptian 
model -- which includes the opening of embassies and trade, 
economic, and cultural ties -- in return for an Israeli 
withdrawal from the entire Golan Heights. Each stage in the 
normalization process will be accompanied by a withdrawal stage. 
Differences surfaced on the timeframe for the withdrawal and 
the fate of the Jewish settlements on the Golan, although the 
Syrians accepted the Israeli position that settlements should 
not be uprooted.

  [Text] Major General Dani Rothschild, coordinator of 
government activities in the territories, was appointed acting 
head of the Israeli delegation to talks with the Palestinians in 
Washington. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports that 
the prime minister has not yet officially ordered Rothschild to 
travel to Washington next week because he does not see a need to 
resume the talks on the Palestinian track in Washington while no 
progress is being made in Taba. 
  Rothschild was appointed after the Americans yesterday made 
clear to Rabin that they will send invitations to the 
Palestinians as well, and suggested that Nabil Sha'th and Amnon 
Shahaq also come to Washington. Jerusalem, however, does not 
wish to harm the Taba talks, which are not linked with the 
Washington talks. Rothschild was appointed acting head because 
the decision on who is to head the delegation to Washington has 
not been made yet.

<F P=106> [Report by Jerusalem correspondent Nadav Shragay] </F>
  [Text] Two reports on illegal building by Arabs in East 
Jerusalem have recently been submitted to senior Jerusalem city 
officials. The first report points to "massive" illegal 
building in the Arab sector in the last few months, particularly 
in 'Isawiyah, Ra's al-'Amud, 'Anata, the Old City, and Herod's 
Gate. 
  Most of it does not consist of building infractions, rather 
construction of new houses. According to city officials, these 
activities are financed by Palestinian elements in view of 
reports about Israeli plans for accelerated construction in the 
eastern parts of the city in anticipation of the negotiations 
about the permanent arrangement in Jerusalem scheduled to begin 
in three years. 
  According to the reports, construction is very rapid, with 
the foundations and the ceiling being built simultaneously so 
that people may move in as soon as possible. The buildings are 
connected to makeshift water and electricity mains, and most of 
the work is done on Saturdays and holidays when municipal 
inspectors are off. 
  According to the municipality's report, a total of 344 
building infractions (most of them new housing starts) was 
registered in East Jerusalem in 1993 alone: 189 in Bayt Hanina, 
Kafr 'Aqab, Shu'fat, and the northern part of the city; and 155 
in the Old City, Jabal al-Mukabir, Sur Bahir, and Umm-Tuba. 
  The second report, issued by the Interior Ministry's 
Planning 
and Construction Inspection Unit, notes that as of July 1993 
"there has been intensive illegal construction in East 
Jerusalem," in the face of "massive lack of inspection" on the 
part of the authorities, including the municipality. A map 
charted in recent months (which includes only parts of East 
Jerusalem and green and unzoned areas) shows that 438 buildings 
were built without permit in the last two years. As noted, the 
map does not include built-up areas, where the volume of illegal 
construction is estimated at hundreds of units. 
  Some 23 solid structures and 12 temporary Bedouin dwellings 
were built within the perimeters of the airport in 'Atarot; 29 
illegal buildings were erected in a green area in Bayt Hanina; 
51 in Walja; 19 in Khirbat Mazmuriyah; 41 in a green area in 
Abu-Tur; 23 in a green and unzoned area in al-Tur; 17 in a green 
and unzoned area in 'Isawiyah; 32 in an unzoned area in Hizma, 
on the edge of the municipal lines; and 13 in Dayr al-'Amud. 
  The report stresses that the charting is partial and has not 
yet been extended to areas where there is a greater incidence of 
illegal construction, such as 'Arab al-Sawahirah, Kafr 'Aqab, 
Ra's al-'Amud, Jabal al-Mukabir, etc. 
  The report states there are numerous reasons for the illegal 
construction, the main ones being: 
  -- Lack of massive inspection in the field. 
  -- The absence of city blueprints indicating where 
construction is legal. 
  -- Population growth. 
  -- The rise in the standard of living after 1967 which 
affords additional building. 
  -- Vagueness about the boundaries of Jerusalem's 
jurisdiction. 
  -- Water connections installed by the municipality, as 
well as water and electricity connections installed by the Arab 
electricity and water companies operating in Jerusalem. 
  The Interior Ministry's report asserts that Jerusalem 
Municipality indirectly caused the rise in illegal construction 
and the establishment of new neighborhoods through the large 
number of legal suits it files against building infractors and 
its lack of power to demolish illegal buildings. "This means 
that an illegally-built structure stands many years as the legal 
proceedings continue. The suits usually end with the infractors 
paying fines or serving short prison terms. Another factor is 
the long-standing policy apparently adopted by the municipality 
not to use a heavy-handed approach on the issue due to internal 
and external pressures." 
  The report goes on to say that the Interior Ministry's chart 
shows the existence of hundreds of inhabited illegal buildings 
in unzoned and green areas included in urban blueprints. Many 
such buildings have been included in city blueprints and 
legalized retroactively, but many others remain illegal. A 
study based on an air photograph carried a few years ago showed 
over 1,000 structures built without permits. The number of such 
buildings has increased considerably since then.

  [Text] Husam Sannun, a resident of Hebron who was 
critically injured yesterday evening during the dispersal of a 
riot near the local Islamic College, died today at Hadassah-'En 
Kerem Hospital. The physicians ruled that he was hit in the head 
by an ax, and not by a bullet, as had been initially claimed. 
Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el reports that the riot in Hebron 
was dispersed by IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers' gunfire. 
  A soldier was lightly injured in Rafah when a fragmentation 
grenade was thrown at an IDF patrol. The soldiers opened fire 
at the estimated site from which the grenade was thrown. IDF 
troops launched searches in the area.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and 'Aqiva Eldar] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Israeli Government will issue an official 
reaction to the report on Irangate, compiled by the special U.S. 
prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, when it is published in the United 
States. The Walsh report is expected to be officially published 
this week. 
  The report levels criticism at Shim'on Peres and Yitzhaq 
Rabin, who were prime minister and defense minister during the 
Irangate affair. 
  The Walsh report claims that Israel's Government was 
involved 
in law violations by U.S. Administration officials. 
  In its reaction, Israel will announce that when the affair 
first started, in 1985, the Israeli Government acts followed the 
assumption that the arms deals with Iran were carried out with 
the knowledge and approval of the senior U.S. political echelons. 
  The Israeli reaction will say that all of the government 
actions were taken in accordance with Israeli law, and that 
according to it, the acts were legal because the Israeli 
Government had assumed that the U.S. elements involved in the 
affair had the authority and approval required. 
  The Israeli reaction, drafted by (reserves) Major General 
Refa'el Vardi, special adviser to the prime minister and defense 
minister, will also include a legal reference to the U.S. 
prosecutor's claims and will address the claims which the Walsh 
report details. 
  Apparently, the Americans will allow Israeli civilians 
mentioned in the report -- such as Ya'aqov Nimrodi, Al 
Schwimmer, and David Kimche -- to respond to claims against them 
in the Walsh report. 
  Jerusalem sources said over the weekend that "Prosecutor 
Walsh has totally failed in his attempt to turn Irangate, an 
affair which caused a public and political storm in the United 
States, into a criminal affair. 
  "They failed to press charges against most of the Americans 
involved in the affair, and even Colonel Oliver North, who was 
put on trial, was eventually acquitted." According to the 
sources, "this is a distant and old story. The United States is 
tired of it, and the report is an artificial attempt by Walsh to 
revive it." 
  The prime minister's bureau said in response to the reports 
about the Walsh report that it has not yet been published, 
therefore the bureau will not refer to its content or 
consequences at this stage. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir 
yesterday presented Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres with the 
ministry's working plan for 1994. The plan for the first time 
sets goals for the ministry's units and Israel's representations 
abroad. The most prominent political goal is the establishment 
of full relations between Israel and Muslim countries: 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, and Pakistan -- in Asia; 
Tanzania, Senegal, and Djibouti -- in Africa; and the North 
African and Gulf countries of the Middle East. The Foreign 
Ministry aspires to establish normalization and economic 
relations even before full diplomatic relations are established. 
  Political sources have said that it is important that ties 
with the large Muslim countries be established before 
negotiations on the future of Jerusalem start. Progress in 
establishing ties with the Muslim and regional countries will 
depend on progress on and the implementation of the agreement 
with the PLO and the peace negotiations on the other tracks. 
  The plan sets two economic goals for the Foreign Ministry: 
Reducing trade deficit between Israel and the European 
countries, and fortifying the spread of Israeli economic 
representatives around the world, with a focus on East Asia. 
Negotiations on drafting the new agreement between Israel and 
the EC will begin next month, according to the mandate the EC 
Council issued in December. 
  The plan urges increasing the incorporation of the private 
sector in economic activity abroad, and calls on Israel's 
representatives abroad to assist in the establishment of ties 
between Israeli and foreign businessmen to give trade a boost.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 19, IRNA -- The visiting Afghan Deputy 
Foreign Minister Jalil Shams here Wednesday said that recent 
clashes in Afghanistan mostly resembled a coup d'etat. The 
Afghan official is currently here for the international seminar 
on the process of development in Central Asia and the Caucasus. 
He told IRNA that incompetency of jihad groups in establishing 
order and security and improving economic and administrative 
condition had added to the people's dissatisfaction. 
  The Afghan official further noted that warring sides should 
declare ceasefire and search for solutions to their differences 
through negotiation. Otherwise, he stressed, the Afghan people 
would suffer heavy financial and human losses. He dismissed 
some analysis that the recent war had an ethnic nture and said 
it was merely a struggle for gaining power. Shams stressed the 
need for international assistance to reconstruct his 
war-devastated country.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 18, IRNA -- Deputy Foreign Minister for 
Euro-American Affairs Mahmud Va'ezi said on Tuesday that Iran 
saw its national security integrated with the establishment of 
stability and calm in the region. 
  Speaking at the international seminar on the process of 
development in Central Asia and Caucasus, Va'ezi also said the 
Islamic Republic was closely monitoring political, social and 
economic developments in Central Asian and Caucasian republics. 
  It is the duty of all countries to contribute to the 
reconstruction of Central Asian countries, the deputy foreign 
minister said. 
  According to Va'ezi, ethnic disputes, civil war and 
conflicts 
with other countries constitute a major impediment to the 
economic development of Central Asian and Caucasian republics. 
  In order to enable those countries to export their gas and 
oil, the Islamic Republic has allowed them to use Iranian ports 
along the Persian Gulf, he said, adding that "this is very 
important and decisive." 
  He said the republics of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and 
Azerbaijan can transport their oil and gas to other countries 
via Iran. 
  The volume of trade between Iran and those countries have 
reached 300 million dollars, Va'ezi said, adding "this is good 
for the beginning."

  [Text] Paris, Jan. 19, IRNA -- Iran's Embassy here Tuesday 
denied allegations on having sent an explosive letter to an 
Iranian residing in Sweden and termed it "banal propaganda". 
  In a statement the embassy said the allegations are mere 
lies 
fabricated by counterrevolutionary terrorist groups. 
  The embassy also said that futility of the allegations will 
become further clear to all when it is asked how it could be 
possible that the sender of such a letter writes down his 
address on the back of the envelope? 
  The statement stressed that it was time for the French 
public 
opinion to deliberate on the presence of terrorist groups who 
have repeatedly committed terrorist acts in France and abroad. 
  AGENCE FRANCE PRESSE (AFP) in a report from Stockholm Monday 
quoted the city police sources that a 45-year-old Swedish of 
Iranian origin was injured the same day due to the explosion of 
a letter sent to his wife. 
  According to the AFP report police sources declined to 
identify the injured, introduced as an opponent of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. It also added that they did not have any idea 
about the point of departure and exact type of the explosive. 
However the same sources claimed the letter it was sent from 
the Iranian Embassy in Paris.

  [Text] The head of the office in charge of Egypt's 
interests in Iran declared Egypt's willingness to expand 
relations and industrial and agricultural cooperation with Iran. 
  Dr. Faraj met the Kerman governor general on Sunday [2 
January] and said that in view of the many common denominators 
between Iran and Egypt and past cultural ties, cordial relations 
between the two countries could foster bilateral cooperation in 
the industrial and agricultural fields. 
  He expressed the hope that by forging ties with Iran, Egypt 
could further expand its relations with the Central Asian 
countries. He announced that Egyptian investors were willing to 
upgrade economic relations with Iran. 
  Kerman Governor General Seyyed Hoseyn Mar'ashi elaborated on 
the potential resources of Kerman Province especially with 
regard to agricultural production in pistachios, dates, citrus 
fruits, and in the mineral industries. 
  It is worth mentioning that in the past few years, the 
Egyptian Government has made extensive efforts to eliminate 
obstacles in the path of relations with Iran. The Egyptian 
regime's desire for relations with Iran stems from the fact that 
the Islamic Revolution of Iran has emerged as a model and a 
legend in the minds of Egypt's revolutionary youth. By 
establishing relations with Iran, the cradle of the Islamic 
Revolution, Egypt will strive to shatter this pattern and legend 
and to harm it. 
  Of course, in conjunction with these efforts, the Egyptian 
Government continues to express its malice and hostility from 
time to time and to level accusations against Iran. The 
Egyptian Government also continues to instigate the regional 
governments of the Persian Gulf against the Islamic Republic of 
Iran by pursuing active diplomacy in this regard.

<F P=106> [Commentary by M. Shahidi: "The Confines of Diplomatic </F>
Activity"] 
  [Text] It is a well-known adage that when one is given 
permission to enter the village, one goes straight to the fellow 
in charge! In our age this common proverb can be applied to the 
great Government of Egypt! Recently, the head of the office in 
charge of Egypt's interests in Tehran met the Kerman governor 
general and expressed the hope that Egypt could further expand 
its relations with the Central Asian countries, by forging 
relations with Iran. 
  Apart from this remark by Dr. Faraj, which seems to be in 
jest, more than anything else, certain questions come to mind. 
However, before answering these questions, it is important to 
mention that propounding such proposals which have a completely 
political bias should, in principle, be presented through the 
proper channels of the Foreign Ministry. How did the head of 
the office in charge of Egypt's interests in Iran surface in 
Kerman Province and what possible synchronicity could exist 
between his political activities and that of the Kerman Province 
and why was such a proposal tendered to the governor general? 
  If such a proposal had been submitted to the Mazandaran 
governor general it could be understandable in principle, as 
Mazandaran Province is contiguous to one of the newly 
independent Central Asian republics. This could be viewed as a 
plausible antecedent and would have generated fewer questions. 
The following points may be noted in the margin of this meeting 
and suggestions provided: 
  1. According to diplomatic norms, the head of the office in 
charge of the interests of other countries should be a citizen 
of a third country that has been assigned to safeguard that 
country's interests when relations have been severed. He is 
supposed to act in the name of that country to preserve these 
interests and the flag of the third country is flown over the 
office. The head of this office is also permitted to meet with 
the host country's officials in the presence of the third 
country's ambassador. 
  In view of the above, the question arises that within all 
these legal restrictions, how did the head of the office for 
Egyptian interests suddenly show up in Kerman Province and 
manage to meet with the governor general? If on the basis of 
some agreement, these restrictions have been lifted, is the 
official in charge of the office of Iran's interests in Cairo 
enjoying similar freedom for diplomatic, economic, and cultural 
activity? 
  According to some who have visited the office for Iranian 
interests in Cairo, its activities are extremely limited and the 
head of the office is not given permission to meet the higher 
officials of the Foreign Ministry. He is not even invited to 
the official receptions that are hosted by that country. All 
this is in addition to the security problems for the office of 
Iranian interests in Cairo, which he faces due to the heavily 
policed situation in the Cairo regime. 
  2. The topic that comes to the minds of readers of this 
report is: What is the common factor between the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and the anti-Islamic Government of Egypt, that 
the head of its interests office was permitted to meet a 
governor general of a province far removed from the center? 
  Is this not the same Egypt that has surpassed all the 
tyrants 
and pharaohs of history in its suppression of active Islamic 
movements and its killing of the oppressed Egyptian people? 
  On the other hand, according to existing reports, the Cairo 
regime is the main base for promonarchical Iranians and the 
radio station of these elements affiliated with the former 
regime is located in Cairo and broadcasts programs from there at 
specific times. 
  In addition, we wish to remind the head of the Egyptian 
interests office in Iran, for his information, that: 
  First, he is quite well aware of our country's position with 
regard to his government and in view of the "complete severance 
of relations" between the two countries, such proposals stem 
from his political immaturity. 
  Second, the phenomenon of the so-called "Islamic 
fundamentalism" in the Central Asian countries has not reached a 
level whereby it has to be suppressed with the help of "foreign 
intervention" and by utilizing Egypt's "valuable experience" in 
this regard! Therefore, it would be preferable if the Cairo 
government is advised to use its experience to surmount the 
problems of its own domestic situation which have stifled the 
very breath of its regime. 
  This is because, according to existing information, 
President 
Husni Mubarak has been greatly perturbed by the cresting of the 
Islamic movement in recent months and the assassinations of 
those criminals whose hands are stained with the blood of the 
Egyptian nation. If he is looking for a scapegoat for a way out 
of this predicament, tell him "to look elsewhere." 
  Third, if--in the past few months--the enrapturing whiffs of 
the zephyr which blows in Tehran have made you so delirious that 
you are voicing such crude proposals, we declare, for your 
information and for that of the government of Cairo, that 
nothing has changed and the former position prevails with the 
same intensity, especially since in the last few months efforts 
are being made to place the filthy mantle of Camp David onto the 
oppressed Palestinian nation and to find a way to prevent the 
defeat of the ill-omened Gaza- Jericho accord.

  [Text] Mr. Mohammad Hashemi, the head of the Voice and 
Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran [radio and television 
organization -- IRIB], today addressed the seminar of the heads 
of news sections in IRIB's provincial centers. He said: The 
truth-seeking minds throughout the world are the targets and 
recipients of the message of the Islamic revolution. By playing 
a more active role in the international system of information, 
we will try to respond to cultural needs. 
  The head of IRIB then referred to the rapid global 
developments in the sphere of communications and information 
during the present era when technology is enjoying progress and 
the nations are awakening. He said: In view of the nations' 
growing inclination towards Islam and idealism, the present 
cultural vacuum and the intellectual crisis felt across the 
world, and finally the vast amount of propaganda against the 
Islamic system, it is clear that the responsibilities of the 
radio and television, as the largest media, are very grave. 
  He stressed that IRIB enjoyed potential talents and 
capabilities which could be utilized in a more efficient way so 
as to expand the sphere of present activities. He then said 
that the operation of the 3d [TV] network and the Radio News 
were part of the new efforts aimed at accelerating the process 
of news and information broadcasting, and filling the society's 
leisure time. 
  According to our correspondent's report, today's meeting 
continued with an address by Mr Hemmati, the deputy head of IRIB 
in charge of political affairs. He referred to the change in 
attitudes towards radio and television, and underlined the 
inevitable need to change the system of news broadcasting in 
order to create a greater momentum in the society, strengthen 
incentives and mobilize the population to participate in the 
reconstruction process. 
  He said: By reliance on its high level of expertise and 
capabilities, IRIB has formulated new plans for expanding field 
information gathering and broadcasting. He added: With the 
start of the Radio News, which will begin transmission during 
the blessed 10-day Fajr celebrations [the anniversary of the 
victory of Islamic revolution on 11 Feb 1979], the necessary 
means for speedy and regular transmission of news will be 
provided. 
  According to IRIB's deputy in charge of political affairs, 
the Radio News programs will be varied, and will cover sports, 
scientific, cultural, arts, economic, social and political news 
from Iran and abroad. He added: With the operation of this 
station, the people will be given more details on latest news 
and information.

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said 
Pakistan firmly believes in going ahead with making a fuller 
peaceful use of atomic technology. She was presiding over the 
annual meeting of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Council in 
Islamabad today. The council reviewed the progress of work at 
different establishments of the Pakistan Atomic Energy 
Commission and considered the main lines of future programs of 
the commission which lay emphasis on self-reliance and 
indigenization. 
  Addressing the council, the prime minister said the Islamic, 
democratic and awami [people's] government fully supports 
achieving excellence and advancement of technology, be it simple 
or high technology. It was the elected prime minister, late 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who had first started the atomic projects 
in Pakistan which are now being implemented. Late Zulfiqar Ali 
Bhutto had 25 years ago given an autonomous status to Pakistan 
Atomic Energy Commission and sought cooperation of the United 
States for support of PINSTECH [Pakistan Institute of Nuclear 
Science and Technology] and other atomic projects. Now, the 
prime minister said, with Chinese cooperation her government is 
completing the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant after 25 years. 
There are some undue misgivings about our peaceful nuclear 
program, but we hope that Pakistan would very soon be able to 
allay these misgivings. 
  The prime minister expressed the determination to make 
Pakistan an enviable, progressive and developed state. She paid 
tributes to the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission scientists for 
working selflessly and single-mindedly without looking for award 
or name. The present government, after its takeover, especially 
marked one of its cabinet meetings for preparation and approval 
of the new technology policy. Despite financial constraints, 
the government earmarked an amount of 1 billion rupees for this 
purpose. She expressed the confidence that the new policy would 
lead the country toward rapid economic development. The present 
government is attaching high priority to the energy sector. 
Work at the 300-megawatt nuclear power plant acquired during 
1988-90 would be completed soon. The prime minister 
complimented the commission on its performance and directed it 
to work with greater vigor for peaceful application of nuclear 
technology for socioeconomic uplift in the country. 
  Earlier, the prime minister was shown the indigenously 
redesigned and upgraded Pakistan Research Reactor-1 and the 
research facilities around it. The chairman of the Pakistan 
Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed, briefed the prime 
minister about the activities in pursuit of peaceful application 
of atomic energy.

  [Text] The government has stepped up its campaign against 
narcotics. Customs, intelligence, and police have conducted 
various successful raids across the country and seized huge 
quantities of narcotics, including heroin and charas, during the 
last one month. 
  In the biggest-ever haul in Lahore today, city police seized 
about 1.5 tonnes of morphine powder and arrested three drug 
couriers. The smuggling attempt was foiled last night in the 
Bund Road area. The material was being smuggled on a truck 
loaded with 497 drums; 50 of them were filled with morphine 
powder. The city policy chief said the three alleged drug 
couriers -- namely Haji Nisar Khan, Akhtar Khan, and Javed Khan 
-- were arrested while raids are being conducted to arrest 
Mahmud Butt and Mujadded Butt. 
  The recent antinarcotics drive is the result of the present 
government's resolve to eradicate the menace from its roots. 
The government has set the year 2000 as the target for complete 
eradication. It is one of the eight points given by the 
Pakistan People's Party in its election manifesto. A Narcotics 
Control Board and the Ministry of Law are working on a draft law 
which will enable the law enforcing agencies to act more 
effectively. Besides other measures, the government also plans 
to enhance its mass awareness campaigns. 
  Fifty tonnes of charas was seized recently when 
antinarcotics 
agencies and Pakistan Customs jointly carried out an operation 
at Makran coast. In the NWFP [North-West Frontier Province], 20 
kg of heroin was seized recently when it was being smuggled from 
the tribal area to Peshawar for down-country dispatch. In 
another raid, 12 kg of heroin was seized at Azadi Chowk post; 
three persons were arrested. A large quantity of heroin and 
charas was also seized at different places in Balochistan.

<F P=106> ["Special report" by Ayesba Haroon] </F>
  [Text] The seizure rate of heroin, opium and charas by the 
12 Federal and provincial law-enforcing agencies, till June 
1993, shows a sharp decline as compared to the corresponding 
period in 1992. 
  Lack of political will showed itself in poor allocations of 
finances to these agencies and a legal cover riddled with [word 
indistinct] and loopholes that gape so wide that entire 
battalions of offenders slip through them. A glaring legal 
omission being the jurisdiction of speedy law court does not 
cover FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] -- hot spots 
for drug production and trafficking. 
  The accumulative effect of the lopsided political will and a 
Swiss cheese legal set-up reflects in poor follow-up of 
registered cases, lower seizures, and a social climate that 
offers no resistance to narco money. Given the fact that around 
two-thirds of the heroin produced in Pakistan is consumed within 
the country and that the number of drug addicts is on the rise, 
reduced seizures do not mean that production or trafficking of 
narcotics has been curtailed -- as some members of the Narcotics 
Control Division would have the public believe. 
  From 2,900 kilograms (kg) of heroin seized in 1992, the 
figure has fallen to 2,179 kgs in 1993. And when compared to 
5,677 kgs of heroin seized in 1991, the quantity seized has more 
than halved. Number of cases registered have also fallen 
sharply -- from 23,494 in 1992 to a mere 10,296 in 1993. 
Quantity of opium seized has also fallen by around 1000 kg. In 
1992, 3,422 kgs of opium were seized, but the figure slid down 
to 2,421 kgs in 1993, and from 2,850 cases registered the number 
was reduced to 1,448 in 1993. 
  In the case of the charas, the quantity seized reduced from 
188,123 kgs in 1992 to 138,097 kgs in 1993. While the number of 
cases registered in 1993 were 9,618 as compared to the 20,847 
cases registered in 1993. 
  Successive governments tried to prove their commitment 
towards eradicating the drug menace by making all sorts of 
speeches. However, no-one worked to develop an effective legal 
framework to effectively check this menace. The caretaker 
government of Moin Qureshi, promulgated an Ordinance, whereby 
the death penalty would be awarded to the drug offenders: 
namely the Dangerous Drugs (Amendment) Ordinance, 1993 whereby 
the assets of an accused awarded punishment lesser than life 
imprisonment are also liable to forfeiture. 
  The law against narcotics offences relating to trafficking 
provided for maximum punishment of life imprisonment. The 
government has decided to amend the law in order to award death 
sentence for the drug traffickers or financing the trafficking 
of narcotics or offences relating to import or export of drugs 
from Pakistan and inter-provinces. 
  Narcotics offences are mainly dealt with under the following 
laws: The Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930; The Prohibition 
(Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979; The Customs Act, 1969; The 
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1989 (Act V of 1898); The Police 
Act, 1861; The Opium Act, 1957; The Opium Act, 1878; and The 
Anti-Narcotics Task Force Ordinance (XII of 1993). 
  There are 14 [as published] agencies on Federal and 
provincial level that are involved in the enforcement of the 
above-mentioned laws. Apart from the provincial police 
departments, provincial Excise Departments and the Frontier 
Constabulary of NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] all other 
law-enforcing agencies come under the ambit of the Federal 
Government. The services of the defence forces can also be 
utilised for the purposes whenever the Federal Government 
decides. 
  Given the fact that there is such a large number of varied 
agencies involved and seven different laws to deal with 
narcotics offences. It is not a wonder that a complete 
confusion prevails. An offence registered under the Hadd cannot 
be punishable by death penalty and an injunction of the speedy 
courts is not applicable to the federally and provincially 
administered tribal areas; while different laws apply to the 
carrier and to the offender who finances the trafficking. 
  Lack of efficient coordination between the various 
government 
agencies involved, the [word indistinct] inherent in partial 
application of the laws, coupled with the fact that money and 
political pressure can delay/change/erase the cases is used by 
the offenders to their maximum advantage. Also the Narcotics 
Control Board cannot spend the kind of money the offenders use 
while fighting legal cases against them. In one case, while the 
Ministry used around Rs [rupees] 3 lakh, the offenders spent a 
hefty Rs 33 lakh -- and went scot-free. 
  Not only are the agencies short of manpower but the 
personnel 
is also not provided with adequate personal security to deal 
with dangerous offenders. While the agencies are unable to 
coordinate their actions, the drug barons are equipped with the 
advanced electronic gadgets for surfeiting the movement of the 
agencies. 
  The law-enforcing agencies have failed to control the 
smuggling of acetic anhydride, the chemical used in making 
heroin. Previously, it was imported in abnormal quantity but 
after its import was restricted, it started being smuggled in 
from India. Recently a group of Rangers was booked for 
smuggling the chemical from India. 
  In a bid to give a modicum of sanity to the to the mess, the 
President and the Prime Minister [PM] have asked for 
recommendations to formulate a national drug policy which 
contains a comprehensive legal package. It is stated to be a 
long-term policy. The PM's camp wants to make it a consensus 
legislation which would fetch them points both at home and 
abroad. 
  To restrict the inflow of drugs in their country the United 
States of America made clear its dissatisfaction regarding the 
performance of the local anti-narcotics agencies a few years 
back and announced the funding of a special tasks force. The 
Ordinance for the force was repeatedly promulgated and a number 
of officers from the services other than those involved in drug 
combat were selected, but the force could not take off. 
  However, according to sources, the Americans reduced their 
funding and in the second half of last year, the Army was asked 
to take over the proposed organisation. A serving general is 
now heading the force, which is still to commence active 
operations. Unless anti-drug operations are supported by the 
political will of the rulers, not much headway can be expected 
in combating this menace. There needs to be social uprising 
against the narco barons and their influence in political, 
bureaucratic and professional bodies must be exposed. Otherwise 
we will enter the 21st century drugged out of our senses.

  [Text] Islamabad, Jan 16: Former Chairperson of the 
Pakistan People's Party [PPP] Begum Nusrat Bhutto and Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto have agreed on a "temporary ceasefire" 
until they work out an amicable solution to their differences. 
  PPP Parliamentary sources told Dawn that both the Bhutto 
ladies had decided to sort out their differences without 
involving anybody else and issuing statements against each other. 
  The PPP parliamentary party held a meeting at the Prime 
Minister's House on Sunday [16 Jan], which Begum Nusrat Bhutto 
was not at all expected to attend. 
  But, according to sources, everybody was surprised when she 
entered the hall where the meeting was about to begin. All the 
participants stood up and loudly said: "Welcome, welcome." 
  Begum Bhutto then went to the Prime Minister and kissed her. 
She also kissed Mr. Asif Ali Zardaris's forehead. 
  Begum Bhutto, the sources said, kept smiling during the 
meeting and exchanged pleasantries with the members. According 
to one member, she said how could she quarrel with her own 
daughter, specially when Mr. Nawaz Sharif and his colleagues 
were all out to take advantage of a family feud. 
  The sources said Begum Bhutto also briefly chatted with Mr. 
Shabbir Chandio, MNA [Member of National Assembly] from Larkana, 
and told him that she had decided to work out an amicable 
solution to differences with her daughter, without involving 
anybody else. 
  The sources said that the Prime Minister had a detailed 
meeting with President Farooq Leghari on Saturday [15 Jan] night 
and discussed with him Begum Bhutto's quarrel with her and her 
partymen. The President assured her that he would meet PPP's 
former chairperson after he returned from a tour of Saudi Arabia 
and try for a reconciliation between the Bhutto ladies. 
  The sources also termed it a ceasefire and according to Ms. 
Rukhsona Bungush private secretary to Begum Bhutto there would 
not be anything special for another "three or four-days." She 
was tightlipped when approached for further comment. She 
however, said: "Things are improving, you better wait." 
  The sources said the Prime Minister and Mr. Asif Ali Zardari 
drove to Begum Bhutto's house on Saturday night without any 
protocol. They stayed there for quite some time and discussed 
their differences on a number of issues. 
  Begum Bhutto reportedly broke into tears and embraced and 
kissed her daughter. She said she was not expecting the Prime 
Minister and her husband. 
  The sources claimed that there was a gradual thaw in 
relations but were the mother and the daughter. 
  "Both Begum Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto have ultimately 
realized that their differences could be exploited by the 
issueless Opposition led by Nawaz Sharif," a source said, 
claiming that a formula was being worked out for a permanent 
peace between them. 
  The entire press corps of the capital reached the Parliament 
building on Sunday just to have a first-hand report on the 
differences between the Bhutto ladies since Begum Bhutto was to 
move a privilege motion and a resolution in the National 
Assembly [NA] secretariat to discuss Jan 5 incident at Larkana. 
  Almost the entire I'ML (N) [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz] 
parliamentary party took part in Sunday's proceedings sensing 
that there would be a lot of fireworks in the National Assembly. 
  However, according to NA secretariat sources, she had 
decided 
not to move any motion in the House. 
  Party sources said it was difficult to say at this stage 
that 
differences between the Bhutto ladies had been removed. But the 
sources sounded quite optimistic that the meeting held on 
Saturday night would ultimately lead to a rapprochment between 
the mother and the daughter.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Truce?"] </F>
  [Text] The apparent softening of Begum Nusrat Bhutto's 
attitude towards her daughter, after a long and bitter spate of 
recriminations, is being interpreted in political circles as a 
temporary truce, which could flare up again into open war at the 
slighter provocation. That provocation, if the allegations of 
arrest of two guards of 70-Clifton is to be believed, has 
already been provided. In the meantime Mir Murtaza Bhutto, 
though still behind bars, has announced the formation of a 
parallel organisation to the PPP [Pakistan People's Party], 
called the Bhutto group. He hopes to attract to it the truly 
`sincere and dedicated' workers of the PPP. If and when the 
group takes off, it may or may not drain the mainstream PPP of 
its core, but it could certainly emerge as a splinter, capable 
of causing damage to the party in Sindh. The crucial factor in 
all this will obviously be the help and patronage of the Begum. 
Deprived of his mother's support the Murtaza faction could 
remain still-born. Therefore, the Prime Minister, in her own 
interest would perhaps try to keep her mother out of the 
divisive scheme that her brother has launched. She may try to 
acquire her mother's symbolic, if not actual, association with 
the main party. That of course, would not only be in the best 
interest of the PPP but also in the best interest of the 
evolution of a two-party system in the country. The split in 
the Muslim League has already done a lot of damage to that 
process. A split in the PPP would only aggravate that 
situation and would, in the days to come, make the forming of a 
stable government even more difficult. 
  The truce, if it holds, is the first hopeful sign in damage 
control since the unceremonious ouster of Begum Bhutto from the 
Chairpersonship of the PPP. But it obviously does not mean the 
end of the rift. The Begum has opted not to speak out for the 
time being, but there is no indication yet of her having given 
an inch on her demand of being restored to the office of 
Chairpersonship. Even if she were to accept a symbolic office 
to salve her hurt ego and give up the quest for the big prize, 
Mir Murtaza having already launched himself on his course of 
sister-bashing, is not likely to give up. The Begum could thus 
be instigated again and again by him to choose between the son 
whom she considers the legitimate heir of his father's legacy 
and her daughter who kept the party together and brought it 
twice to power. It may not thus be just a triangular fight 
within the family for the PPP crown, but an emotional divide 
within the Begum herself. Because, unless Mir Murtaza decides 
to rein in his overweening ambition, the Begum will eventually 
have to cast her lot with one or the other of her siblings. [as

  [Excerpt] The PLO Executive Committee will hold an 
emergency meeting in Tunis on Thursday [20 January] to discuss 
the results of the Syrian-U.S. summit, Palestinian participation 
in the Washington talks, and the deteriorating situation in the 
occupied territories. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, PLO Executive 
Committee 
member Yasir 'Amr said that this meeting has been proposed by 
Faruq Qaddumi, head of the PLO Political Department. 
  'Amr indicated that in a telephone conversation with him 
from 
Tunis, Faruq Qaddumi stressed the importance of this meeting 
under the current circumstances experienced by the Palestine 
question and in light of the Israeli intransigence on the 
implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 
  'Amr stressed the importance of 
Palestinian-Jordanian-Syrian-Lebanese coordination before going 
to the 11th [as published] round of negotiations in Washington 
on Monday. 
  The PLO Executive Committee member praised the results of 
the 
Syrian-U.S. Geneva summit. He denied that these results have 
terrified the Palestinian side. 
  'Amr said: On the contrary, these results will help the 
Palestinians and support their arguments before the Israeli 
negotiator. He indicated that the concepts that President 
al-Asad raised will obviously and directly help the Palestinian 
track. He said that these concepts must be followed during the 
interim and the final phases. 
  'Amr added that this summit has set a formula for resolving 
the Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East and specified the 
concept of a durable peace, a peace that satisfies the parties 
concerned and that is based on the resolutions of the 
international legitimacy and the principle of trading territory 
for peace. 
  'Amr described President al-Asad as a man of broad vision 
with a brave pan-Arab position, a man who is aware of the future 
and of the current changes. He noted that President al-Asad is 
a man of a profound experience, and that he has placed Israel 
before a difficult option if it wants to be part of the Middle 
East. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by President Saddam Husayn marking the third </F>
anniversary of the Mother of Battles in Baghdad on 16 January -- 
live or recorded] 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate: Great 
people, valiant men of our valiant Armed Forces, sons of our 
glorious Arab nation, friends throughout the world: Peace be 
upon you. 
  Arabs, led by the Iraqis, have, since the formation of the 
first human civilization on earth, looked at the universe and 
creation as a whole. They have examined both comprehensively 
and have discharged their task with responsibility and honor. 
If Arabs are preoccupied with any part the universe or 
creation, it is in the interest of a more comprehensive outlook 
and responsibility. Arabs have never separated life and their 
outlook on creation and the universe from any of their 
fundamental rules. They never became obsessed with the part at 
the expense of the whole. In none of their awakenings have they 
relied on the material to the exclusion of the spirit. 
  Indeed, Arabs have never achieved any state of awakening 
based on the material laws of life. Whenever any of the Arabs 
swung to the material side, that period was labeled an age of 
degradation or intellectual backwardness. In any case, this has 
never been a characteristic in which Arabs have taken pride. 
They have never taken such a state of affairs as their ideal 
or set it as an example. Nor did they call on others to follow 
that route. From this perspective and stand, Arabs played the 
role they set for themselves or the role chosen for them by God. 
Every elevation of the intellect and duty of principle was 
inspired by a universal outlook in which there was a balance 
between the spiritual and the material, with the spiritual 
indeed taking precedence over the material. The legitimacy and 
intrinsic value of all material things is reinforced by the 
degree to which it is tempered with spiritualism. On such 
foundations of the spirit and thought was built the historical, 
psychological, and ideological edifice and our perspective on 
things. With the help of the God of heaven and earth, and his 
wise choice, Arabs were chosen as messengers of humanity to 
humanity and their land the cradle of prophets, bolstering the 
role of the Arab nation as the gateway for the world's first 
civilization. 
  When idelogy, values, and attitudes are shaped by this 
concept of spirit as an attitude and civilization as an entity, 
and when people on this blessed earth play their role according 
to what crystallizes in their thoughts and accumulates in their 
consciences then, the people of this earth will be the first to 
understand the relationship between what is material and what is 
spiritual. They will also understand the balance between this 
relationship and the priority given to spiritual elements in the 
course of life. It is necessary to understand the detrimental 
effect of material objects on life when they get the upper hand. 
  We must always be extremely aware of the essential 
difference 
between those who drown in spirit and those who drown in other 
considerations throughout history. Those who drown in the 
latter will appear dry or possibly hollow and will repeat the 
past. Consequently, they will be tossed about by the wind and 
the laws of life, like a dry bush that cannot resist the winds 
or extend its roots deep into the earth to grow and reach the 
pure air and the useful sun. 
  Everyone should realize the difference between the world of 
considerations and spirit, from which man can proceed to 
establish a civilization in which the laws of life prosper, in 
which man corrects himself, and in which the laws of the period 
develop in the areas of culture, industry, agriculture, art, and 
science in light of justice, fairness, and what satisfies God 
and the people; and the mere adoption of what has been done by 
others without playing any role in the development of what has 
been intrusted to man to establish his civilization by absorbing 
the accepted laws of his age and interacting with what requires 
interaction, and creating what should be created. 
  All this comes after seeking to win the satisfaction of 
Almighty God, to achieve man's happiness, and not to deprive him 
of the foundation of his personality in terms of position, 
decision, thought, and behavior in light of his history and 
heritage in the deepest and most comprehensive way. He should 
also create the values of the society of that age and not 
imitate what contradicts the pan-Arab and national 
characteristics, but imitate that society which has a memorable, 
influential role in human life. While this society affects 
other nations, it will keep an open mind to the experiences of 
those nations with which it interacts. The actions of this 
society will be based on its past intellectual, cultural, and 
historical bases and its present ideology and creativity. 
  Breaking away from what is spiritual and moving toward what 
is material on the pretext that this is the law of this age will 
also lead to one's drowning in what is material. Instead of 
being the pillar used by spiritual laws as an influencial means 
befitting its time to flourish under suitable civilized 
circumstances when possible, according to the laws of this age, 
and to balance life and help straighten it up on the basis of 
spiritual laws, this trend will lead to to one's drowning in 
materialism if it is used as an absolute basis in thought and 
action. For it will then becomes an end rather than a means 
which, if used properly, will make life and the spirit progress, 
and will realize man's happiness through self-satisfaction that 
is immersed in faith and through the others' perception of how 
to tackle the basics of the laws of life and man's relationship 
with his fellow man. 
  It has been historically proven that Arabs have been the 
pioneers in the realm of the spirit, that the realm of the 
spirit has chosen Arabs to introduce itself to the world, and 
that Arabs were the ones who introduced the world to the realm 
of the spirit. They constituted the first human civilization 
which shows that they were the first to create the basics of 
what elevates life to a level that distinguishes man. The edge 
Arabs enjoyed over others in their approach to the realm of the 
spirit becomes evident in their ability to put things within 
their proper perspective, be it when they tackle the material 
world, or through their approach and evaluation of what is or os 
not ethical, what is or is not just, particularly when it 
concerns their present and future, as well as their past and all 
the other human affairs. To clarify things, we say: Can the 
United States, or India, for example, be taken as a standard of 
measure in the modern world for what is advanced or not, or of 
what is more advanced? Why is it that the United State, Japan, 
France, or Britain continue to be viewed as the basic standards 
of measure by all those who had an edge in production and 
invention in the field of technology in a general manner, and on 
the basis of the general criteria of a phase such as the one we 
have mentioned? 
  We are certain that the basis for this is that they were 
pioneers in the field of invention which gave them an edge in 
the field of production. 
  Even on the basis of this incomplete example from life, 
those 
who contemplate life and mankind in accordance with a sound 
concept would realize and understand the pioneering role Arabs 
have played for themselves and others. 
  Invention, usage of an invention, and accumulated 
experiences, are considered a criteria by which others will 
judge any stage. Such a stage may be long or short. Why aren't 
Arabs, including Iraqis, entitled to clearly view things in 
terms of their sources which have a pure spirit, civilization, 
ideology, and everything else that measures what is spiritual 
and what is materialistic, favoring what is spiritual over what 
materialistic whenever it conflicts with and obstructs the 
prosperity of what is spiritual? 
  This clearly shows that one who controls the movement in the 
materialistic world is not suitable as an example, or as a 
model, or as a judge of others unless he balances his approach 
and behavior according to what is spiritual, just, and fair, and 
respects the considerations of other nations, and unless he 
recalls the requirements of a fair position and not ambitions or 
egomania. 
  From these concepts, and from an understanding of divine 
wisdom we can see that mankind has not singled out any prophet, 
messenger, heavenly or unheavenly religion. Therefore, in 
Amman, in February 1990 we had to face those who called both 
covertly and overtly for surrendering to the U.S. unilateral 
political control of the world, after the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. We wondered whether the United States would act in a 
responsible and wise manner toward the world, or whether it 
would fall into the abyss of rashness. Thus, it would not 
control the world, but would fall from the peak after losing 
much of its means to perpetuate its brute force. 
  Today, this is the world of which we are a part, and you are 
also part of it. With a simple look, anyone will see a blazing 
world in which the most sacred of sanctities are violated, and 
also the highest values of peoples and nations, states, and 
international relations are violated. Moreover, he will see 
blood flowing like rivers, and injustice climbing up to the 
world of evil so that it is almost drowned in it, and hunger 
overwhelming a great portion of world peoples. He will also see 
that the United States, which is practicing hegemony from its 
apex, has quickly found itself--thanks to the desire for 
domination and its accompanying mistakes and also due to others' 
resistance--displaced from the apex of the material world and 
the world of domination and unilateral control which it wished 
for in the new world order. The United States has even begun to 
decline, even according to the standards of supremacy over 
others in the United States' own world. 
  Every reasonable and mature person has realized that the 
world order called for by the former president of the United 
States is a call to realize an unruly imperialist wish to give 
the United States control over the gates of a big prison for the 
entire world. This order was not meant to uphold justice and 
fairness, nor to cherish the peoples' sovereignty, independence, 
peculiarities, values, spiritual legacy, and right to choose 
their own way of life. The United States has been removed from 
the zenith. There are no longer any peaks for the United States 
to climb. Material peaks cannot be called peaks that promote 
humanity. However, the United States might soon start to climb 
the mountain to either reach the highest material capability in 
terms of influencing the course of events, if it rids itself of 
the complex of hubris and the temptation of immersion in 
material standards of measurement, which we do not think to be 
most likely, or to fall into the final abyss that stands below 
it, which we believe to be most likely, based on what we know of 
today's world and its deep-rooted history. 
  Well-known factors, some of which are similar to what we 
currently criticize in U.S. policy, caused France and Britain to 
climb down to the foot of the mountain in the aftermath of World 
War II, leaving the peak to the United States and the former 
Soviet Union. When the United States climbs down from the peak 
to the foot of the mountain, it will not remain on the foot of 
the mountain. Most likely, it will continue its move downward. 
And because the material world is not amenable to absolutism, 
no one has any guarantees of survival on the peak indefinitely, 
by any standards, particularly since the United States did not 
reach the peak by incremental and firm steps, nor by fair 
entitlement. It reached the peak when a vacuum presented 
itself. Hence, it seized the opportunity to fill this vacuum. 
  Given the terms we have used in our characterization of the 
United States, Zionism, their ambitions, the nature of their 
alliance, as well its objectives; 
  Given the fact that all this conflicts with the terms we 
have 
used to characterize Iraq and the Arab nation, regarding the 
disparity in goals, character, positions, and the nature of the 
faith embraced by our nation and its eternal message throughout 
all ages; 
  In view of United States' efforts to dominate the world 
militarily, politically, and economically; 
  In view of Zionism's efforts to exploit the world, in 
cooperation with the United States at present, and, at other 
times, with other powers, in pursuit of the policy of the 
convergence of interests and proportionateness of capabilities 
to realize joint ambitions, contradiction reached the point of 
clashes after the United States found, or, as a matter of fact, 
deluded itself into believing that the time was right to crush 
the epitome of values the Arabs see as an example to be emulated 
in terms of national and pan-Arab dignity, faith, integrity, and 
development. Consequently, the conspiracy was unleashed. 
  After many had given up the duty of rejecting what ought to 
be rejected and of accepting what is right and appropriate for 
peoples' interests and states' sovereignty, the United States, 
Zionism, and those who went into temporary alliances with them 
under certain circumstances, miscalculating the seriousness of 
such alliances, were encouraged to be dragged to an ill-omened 
aggression against the Iraq of the Mother of Battles. 
  Brothers, international relations cannot be rectified and 
stability cannot be achieved through certain parties' desire for 
hegemony and control. For, control destroys international 
relations and destroys the party that wishes to control. This 
has always been the outcome of every attempt in this regard by 
all those who established and created leadership on the basis of 
the world of belongings and things and their standards, and on 
the basis of strength. The international community now needs 
the wisdom of the group and collective leadership. Everyone, 
especially those who are known to have the balance in their 
favor in the material world, should remember that the capability 
and wisdom that satisfy God are not exclusively possessed by the 
big countries or the big powers. Perhaps wisdom is the last 
thing they consider. It does not become part of their lives 
until there appear powers that are bigger and more evil and 
aggressive than they are. Such new powers may even appear in 
their own world, the world they have opted for and through which 
they chose to be different from others--the world of material 
belongings. In fact, history teaches us that power has not been 
a constant asset for big states or big populations. Power does 
not indefinitely settle with large armies or states. History 
can help us recall further examples that tell us that fatal 
strikes against the largest armies and states have not been made 
by equal or superior powers, in accordance with traditional 
yardsticks of the meaning of power. Rather, such strikes have 
been made by powers that possess new yardsticks of power. A 
view of the results of what had been originally sought to be 
achieved in accordance with the plans and hopes of the states of 
aggression against Iraq, and against Somalia later on, will help 
provide a sound vision and clear piece of evidence about a major 
event which had a profound and comprehensive meaning and results. 
  On the eve of the 30-state aggression against Iraq, there 
were in Iraq targets that suit the capability of the advanced 
Western military technology. There were large hospitals for 
children and women, and others for the entire people. There 
were sophisticated plants, large buildings, water and 
electricity facilities, oil refining installations, everything 
that is related to oil products, and historical sites. Among 
the targets were even residential buildings that loftily tell of 
a prosperous age. For the means of destruction, all those 
constituted visual targets by firing from a distance. 
  The aggressors thought that these targets -- as well as 
civic and military airports, mosques, churches, academic and 
cultural centers, and even radar sites, which attract a familiar 
type of their weapons and guide them to their targets -- are 
suitable targets according to the standards of an appropriate 
target. A target is deemed appropriate in line with the 
technical considerations of their weapons, which are 
computer-fed. 
  The aggressors thought that the very fact that Iraq has such 
targets, which are appropriate for their weapons which they fire 
from a distance -- and the fact that each of these targets is, 
of material value, equal or superior to the material value of 
the shell they fire at it -- they thought this was enough to 
make Iraq bow down to their will. They sought to impose this 
evil will on Iraq and terrorize the world through Iraq. 
However, when the confrontation took place and consisted, on 
their part, of firing from a distance, and considering that the 
brunt of it came from the air -- it was the heaviest known in 
the history of aggression and war -- the harvest was in line 
with what Almighty God had decreed. Certainly, the results were 
contrary to their frustrated wishes and contrary to computer 
calculations, which were fed by the will of evil minds which 
have never entertained good thoughts. 
  Preparations for the aggression against Iraq lasted more 
than 
six months, before the frustrated people dared to attack 
beautiful Baghdad two and a half hours after midnight on 16 
January and early in the morning on 17 January 1991. This 
period gave them a chance to collect much information about 
Iraq. Thus, the politicians and military found out a basic part 
of the information they were interested in, in terms of Iraq's 
size, population, the nature of its resources, its development, 
and even more private information in geopolitics and military 
and economic affairs. They found out, among other things, that 
Iraq, regardless of everything, has a small population, small 
size, and is a Third World nation according to the standards of 
technological and economic development. Those concerned also 
knew, through the information disseminated by the West about 
Iraq's capabilities and weapons -- portraying Iraq's 
capabilities in legendary terms as very destructive -- that the 
weapons they had amassed would be enough not only to achieve the 
declared and undeclared objectives which the villains made 
public or hid in their malicious, senile minds, but also enough 
to change the face of the earth and mankind. 
  This is what military officials and politicians used to say 
about the effect of their weapons once they would be used 
against Iraq. These included the U.S. secretary of state, who 
contributed to the aggression decision. Some of their political 
and military officials made statements to the same effect, not 
to mention the false and deceptive news blared out by their 
media. When they ceased fire upon the orders of the U.S. 
President, his allies or the greater part of them learned of the 
cease-fire decision from his famous speech in which he announced 
a unilateral cease-fire. The decision was made after they had 
collided with the Republican Guards southwest of al-Basrah and 
after facing watchful resistance whenever they came in contact 
with the army and people of great Iraq and with the roaring 
magnanimous thunder of our air and defense forces, the missile 
forces, the army helicopter gunship cavaliers, and all the 
troops and corps of our great army and valiant Armed forces. 
Despite the concentration of aircraft of all types and 
purposes, which covered the skies of the battle against the 
Republican Guards, the failed aggressors realized they would 
enter a new stage as a result of that resistance and would face 
consequences for which they had not made plans, therefore, the 
U.S. President announced the unconditional cease-fire, except 
for actions to protect their armies in case they were exposed to 
Iraqi fire. 
  The dust of the first chapter of the conflict with the 
regular armies settled down, but the aggression continued 
afterward in the form of air attacks on the Republican Guards in 
a treacherous breach of the cease-fire--a breach which is 
usually noted in the history of the invaders. The aggressors 
then stirred their Iran--sponsored chapter of aggression, which 
was not less evil or barbaric than their regular aggression 
against Iraq, but was in some ways tougher. This was followed by 
two more aggressions on 13 and 17 January 1993 and 26 June 1993, 
a series of occasional attacks on our air defenses, aircraft, 
and other targets were carried out between and after the two 
aggressions. 
  Briefly, the world of regimes and rulers in general, with 
few known exceptions, was divided into either keen participants 
or indifferent observers. However, after all that has happened, 
including the chapter of the severe and continued blockade, 
those regimes are now standing astonished, finding no sufficient 
explanation in their minds for the Iraqi people's great and 
legendary steadfastness. These people and the valiant army of 
the Mother of Battles are rightfully worthy of this great and 
honorable record. Thus, with the help of God, the militant 
Iraqis have managed to bring closer to the minds of those who 
went astray or temporarily deviated from the path of guidance 
and faith the extent of God's capability. The militant Iraqis 
have placed the entire world at the beginning of the road which 
will lead it to overcoming the complex of fear that the U.S. 
unilateral leadership of the material world has implanted in its 
soul. This fear has been so great that they dropped their 
weapons, or rather the weapons of infidelity, the moment this 
dreadful name was ever mentioned. The first wound that pained 
the soul and body of dear Baghdad with the first bomb that hit 
its land or any target in it on 17 January 1991 was the actual 
beginning of the weakness that has crept into limbs of those 
bragging about their strength and looking down on others. With 
the first bomb that hit Baghdad, pain and illness afflicted the 
bodies and souls of the treacherous tyrants of the 20th Century 
and their followers who disregard others, only to be disregarded 
by God and their own and other peoples. Thus, in the name of 
God, the souls of many states and peoples were healed. 
  Afterward, there came a supporting experience which revealed 
the traits of the free peoples. In view of the subsequent 
effects of the atmosphere of the immortal Mother of Battles that 
we have already described, and in view of the results that it 
had produced, the tyrants belittled the will of peoples and 
ignored the will of God. Nay, they ignored all that would 
remind them of wisdom. As ever, they discredit the poor and 
enslave human beings. 
  The people of Somalia were starving. Hunger, disease, and 
lack of clothing were apparent. They had only God to shelter 
them. They had no targets which are appropriate for the weapons 
and shells that are fired from a distance, some from thousands 
of kilometers. Not a single house in Somalia was equal in 
material value to their guided missiles. Also, the Somalis do 
not have many public facilities that prompt one to destroy them. 
  Because the pockets of the treacherous -- who gave the 
aggressors the price for the shells with which they struck Iraqi 
cities and other targets and Baghdad, the city which preserved 
the values of the civilization of the Arabs and the heritage of 
humanity which believed in God -- were emptied and could no 
longer support or finance a destructive aggression for a long 
period with expensive weapons, the devil thought once again of 
trying its luck in Somalia. The penetration of the skin and 
flesh of Somali children and women, and even men, requires only 
light hardware to be fired at a starving people who were 
exhausted by hunger and thrown away on sidewalks. 
  Bearing this description in mind, they thought that they 
could horribly insult not only to the people of Somalia but also 
to all nations of the world. Perhaps foremost among the people 
they had in mind to once again try to influence were the people 
of Iraq. This is why they once again belittled other nations. 
And God humiliated and disgraced them again and glorified the 
people of Somalia, who are starving and without clothes, save 
the clothes of dignity. 
  The villains thought that a people whom they think are 
powerless and who do not have an army like that of Iraq would 
quickly bargain over their leaders. Perhaps, they thought that 
the Somali people would save them the trouble of using their 
bullets of death and that some of them would quickly assassinate 
their resistance leaders. Damn their ideas, which will only lead 
them to further miscalculations and will throw them out of the 
realm of honor and respect. 
  Having been exhausted by their sick ideas, and after their 
plans fail to achieve their malicious goals, the Americans left 
a country which is not for them. What is worse still in 
describing the level of their moral deterioration is that 
America, which unfairly and aggressively advocated certain ideas 
in Somalia and mobilized others for this purpose, was not 
content, in its moral deterioration, by involving its allies. 
Its deterioration exceeded all possible limits and previous 
actions when it withdrew its troops and asked others publicly to 
remain in Somalia. It is strange for some Third World nations 
to accept this, while some of them say their regimes represent 
Islamic states. Do they not ask themselves about the legitimacy 
of staying in Somalia in the form of occupation of aggression, 
or in a manner that conflicts with the will of the Somali 
people? Do they think that the will of a people that rejects 
the presence of an occupying foreigner on its territory 
indicates that such a people are in need of foreign protection? 
  Brothers and friends the world over and in our greater Arab 
nation: This is an important aspect of the meanings of the 
suffering, bloodshed, and the record of jihad and struggle of 
the great Iraqi people in the Mother of Battles. Those who take 
a profound look at these meanings can reach conclusions which 
please and satisfy a suffering humanity, telling it that the 
beginning to the road of human guidance, after a long period of 
forgetting its meanings, has appeared. Also, the beginning of 
the road to deterioration and collapse of the tyrant has also 
appeared. 
  The experience acquires greater richness, becomes a 
catalyst for forward movement, and gains greater significance 
when we recall the role of our Palestinian Arab people, who 
dwell in our hearts and consciences, as well as each and every 
act of resistance and steadfastness throughout the world. The 
Palestinian people have taught all mankind that the weapons of 
resistance can be found on the ground as well as in hearts, 
consciences, and faithful minds. Wherever there is soil, there 
are weapons -- namely stones. Whoever loses control of his 
territory is bound to get it back. He is bound to find stones 
on it to use in resisting tyrants, the occupiers of the 
territory and the usurpers of its history and orchards, who have 
been humiliating all Arabs and Muslims. 
  We salute the struggle of the Palestinian people, the stone- 
throwing people, the people who have an abundance of inexpensive 
weapons, and who are using them in resisting tyrants. These 
weapons are of great significance. Compared to arms depots all 
over the world, stones are sacred. 
  We salute the Somali people, and all peoples who have chosen 
to resist the evil will, to confront falsehood with right, to 
uphold the rights of the poor by the vindication of right, and 
to resist their exploitation by those who seek to rob them of 
their dignity, resources, and freedom. 
  O brothers and friends: Given what we are speaking of on 
this occasion; the other things that took place in the eternal 
Mother of Battles; the great faith-inspired resistance and 
gracious patience demonstrated by the great Iraqi people; and 
the examples they have set for mankind in general, and Third 
World nations in particular; you can now provide a better answer 
to the question posed by some regarding the objective the allies 
sought by attacking the Iraqi people, while ignoring others, in 
their savage aggression of 17 January 1991. In the same vein, 
you can also provide a better answer as to why their demons have 
failed to enable them to undermine the spirit of Iraq, and why 
their evil exasperation has been aggravated further, prompting 
them to engage in successive acts of ceaseless aggression, 
including the aggression they are mounting on our airspace and 
soil in northern Iraq, the aggression they are mounting on our 
airspace in southern Iraq, as well as their continued control of 
persons whose records are disgraceful and whose minds are evil, 
not to mention the unfair embargo they are maintaining against 
us. This has been the fate of their acts despite the blows they 
have dealt to Iraq. The answer, brothers, lies in all that we 
have said, and also in the example set by the Iraqi people in 
terms of the significance of their resistance to tyrants, and 
also in terms of the significance of the indispensable gracious 
patience they have demonstrated so that they may mark for 
themselves, for their nation, and for mankind a juncture for 
moving toward a better life along the path of genuine and 
selfless interaction that is free of greed, tyrannical 
inclinations, injustice, and totalitarianism. 
  O Arabs: Sound beginnings help achieve sound results. 
Although we realize that this alone is not enough to achieve the 
necessary results of our nation's struggle and jihad under 
circumstances similar to ours, the right description of the 
state of affairs in any domain that is viewed from a leadership 
perspective and determination is something essential and cannot 
be done away with in search of suitable solutions and 
accomplishments. It is not enough to embark on an analysis to 
explain the background of part of our role as Arabs and the 
background of our culture, heritage, and constant position as 
handed down throughout history. 
  Accordingly, what we said about the present stage of 
development in international and human life and its negative 
phenomena, will genuinely help us as Arabs and help our struggle 
and jihad and even our pan-Arab action, each according to the 
description befitting him whether the concerned Arabs are 
mujahidin and strugglers or mere workers in the political 
fields, and regardless of the titles under which any of them was 
listed when the nation advanced in its role, position, and 
results of what was achieved in terms of civilized description 
and offer when Baghdad represented the entire Arab nation 
through its influence, role, history, and outlook. 
  This continued until the eye, soul, strength, and 
consciousness of Baghdad stopped playing that role or having 
that influence when it collapsed after weakness penetrated the 
trunk of its tree. That tree became dry and broke into pieces 
at the hands of Hulegu in 1258. Before that date, and right 
from the beginning of its representation of the modern Arab age, 
Baghdad was a splendid example of balance between the spiritual 
values and requisites of development on the one hand, and 
outlook for a new life replete with virtue, prosperity, justice, 
and fairness in a state far more advanced than all others in the 
world on the other. Baghdad had thus based itself on the spirit 
of new faith and values of noble Islam. It used Islam's 
superiority to nourish the material pillar of life, giving no 
prominence to material considerations over spiritual or moral 
values. This was the case especially when a serious 
contradiction was visible and when the wise men of the nation 
and those mainly responsible for its banners and soundness of 
its direction agreed that it had this negative description. 
  However, Baghdad maintained its positive description and 
role, as we have said. It was not implicated itself in what 
past empires did nor in what subsequent empires continue to do. 
It has not replaced the role of a leader, guide, rescuer, and 
instructor in its relations with the other nations with the role 
of a dominator or subjugator. It has not replaced the role God 
has ordained for it in the koranic phrase "But give them 
preference over themselves, even though poverty was their own 
lot" by a role turning its wise leaders into monopolizers. The 
concern of its leaders was how to feed the hungry people, help 
the poor, and protect virtue even when those to whom care was 
extended were preparing to harm Baghdad. 
  Subsequently, our Arab civilization has not changed or 
developed in a manner that would lead it to produce a community 
governed and enslaved by material things. Rather, it exploited 
material things in the service of higher values. The spiritual 
factor remained the cornerstone of the new civilization and 
human values. This state of affairs continued until the Arab 
empire collapsed. Despite the weakness that preceded its 
existence, and despite the flaws that had been recorded against 
it and against its leaders, this empire did not develop into a 
materialistic state and society. Almighty and all-powerful God 
may have ordained that material development be transferred to 
the West so that the Arabs would not bear its consequences and 
so that they would not deviate from the sound human track, as 
did the Westerners for this and other reasons, in terms of their 
relations with other nations and peoples and with their own 
selves. 
  The Arabs have not created a materialistic society following 
the example of Western development and the exploitation and 
tyranny that this development has created. Yet, the Arabs 
remained in a state of temporary inertia, looking indecisively 
for a role and seeking to revive their past role. At that 
stage, the Ottomans tried to play this role and to obliterate 
the role of the Arabs. The Arabs did not score any 
accomplishment of historic value, and remained this way until 
the beginning of the formation of the regional, so-called nation 
states. When 'Abd-al-Nasir launched his revolution of 23 July 
1952 in Egypt, many of these states were under foreign control 
and basically run as part of foreigners' strategies. Even when 
national regimes came to power in some Arab countries, confusion 
continued among national rulers, despite Arab thinkers' efforts. 
Those rulers either relied on irrelevant parts of history and 
heritage, or reviewed history and heritage only to cite verbal 
examples that are void of any content and never meant to be put 
into practice. Rulers did not play any effective intellectual 
role to develop parts of our heritage to support our present 
requirements. Many, both rulers and ruled, remained unable to 
find the sound formula to strike a balance between the 
materialistic and the spiritual, between the past and the 
present, between leading a religious life and living under 
acceptable contemporary laws, between the contemporary life 
copied from the West's trivialities and the nature of the 
required life, and between the heritage it values and the 
requirements of our age to achieve a spiritual and material 
civilization. They remained undecided between the rigid texts 
on the recorded history of rule and what we should decide 
theoretically and practically after absorbing and learning from 
the past. They also remained undecided between the importance 
of nationalism and the necessity of pan-Arabism. This state of 
affairs continued until most of the people, led by most of the 
rulers, were divided into either followers and copiers of the 
West's trivialities, which left the people without a spirit and 
without a role, or into parrot-like copiers of pieces of history 
and heritage, without putting their methods to the test or 
molding them to conform with the age in which they live. 
  As for the process of creating by building on tradition, as 
an intellectual and practical stand, we find virtually no 
examples of this in the policies of any ruler, nor do we find 
its application in a serious, comprehensive, and profound manner. 
  The sons of the nation have, throughout this period, 
continued jihad, struggle, and work. Some of them have brought 
us other ideas and views on humanity and the experience of other 
nations. Some of the sons of this nation, which God chose as a 
nation justly balanced, that ye might be witness over the 
nations, and the messenger a witness over you [part of Koranic 
verse] -- since it is the source of the first regiment that 
upheld the banner of Islam until the banners of faith spread 
outside the Arab nation -- have adopted communism, 
notwithstanding its atheism, under the pressure of social 
injustice and intellectual loss. 
  Regardless of how close or divergent views are between the 
sons of the one nation, following the example of other nations 
will not achieve progress for our nation. What will do this is 
a process of creation that rests on great faith in God and the 
higher values of our spiritual heritage. The foremost of these 
values are justice, fairness, creating an appropriate atmosphere 
for virtue, fighting vice, and making the poor of the nation the 
center of the attention of the ruler, since they have a right to 
the wealth of the nation, just as they have duties in the 
efforts and jihad of the nation. Also, we must provide the 
requirements for the cultural progress of the nation, based on 
pan-Arab thought and the structure of the pan-Arab society and 
faithful pan-Arab state. 
  Brothers, friends, believers, free people of the world and 
bearers of the banner of dignity. You tyrants, covetous, and 
disappointed criminals as well: God decreed our liberation 
after our suffering, thus he increased our patience and 
capabilities, which are protected by his power. God also gave 
us wisdom that enabled the people of Iraq to follow the right 
path. Let all villains know, however, that the people and 
leadership of Iraq, from a position of responsibility and 
patience, will not turn wisdom into a prelude for weakness and 
despair. 
  If we were patient over the continuation of the blockade, 
which was imposed by the will of the evildoers, despite all the 
actions of the tamperers and evildoers; and were also patient 
over the continuation of their flights in the southern part of 
our dear, deep-rooted Iraq, that violate its airspace and have 
been preventing our planes from flying south of the 32d parallel 
for some time with the help of some evildoers from Saudi Arabia 
and Kuwait; and the continuation of absurdity in the northern 
part of our beloved homeland and in the life of our dear people 
north of 36th parallel, despite the fact that the nature of 
their intentions and weak pretexts were exposed--we will not 
relinquish our people in the northern part of the homeland. Nor 
will we stand idle toward the continuation of the blockade and 
the violation of our sovereignty in southern Iraq. 
  For all evildoers, masters and satellites, we reiterate 
that they must not be deluded once again or miscalculate things. 
They should learn from the lessons of the recent past and 
comprehend their meanings on bases free of their evil 
intentions. Let them fear God and remember that his will is 
above theirs and that of their devils. Otherwise, the 
punishment of the criminals is an eye for an eye and a tooth for 
a tooth. God is great. For all those concerned among the Arab 
rulers, we say: All that you have done against the people of 
Iraq is something that angers God, his prophet, the believers, 
all free Arabs, those who keep their pledges before God, and all 
those who work for the nation's glory, loftiness, and happiness, 
and for the sake of triumphing for the poor ones and for 
supporting the wronged people against the positions of 
injustice, corruption, and hunger. I also say that there is 
still some way out of this. I tell the wise believers: Will you 
do so? I have conveyed the message, and may God be my witness. 
  O glorious Iraqi women; O zealous and glorious Iraqi men: 
You have endured a great deal. You are worthy of the honorable 
endurance you have experienced, and of the rewards of such 
endurance. But, you still have to demonstrate the endurance 
usually required of believers during the last 10 days of the 
blessed month of Ramadan. Of course, there are rewards for 
fasting during this period in Ramadan. Patience and fasting 
during this period further cleanses the mind while the body is 
relieved of additional burdens to obtain the satisfaction of the 
merciful and compassionate God. Afterward, people celebrate the 
great feast, and mark a great victory of the mind, as well as a 
great victory over enemies, God willing. 
  May God answer our prayers, ease our burdens, strengthen our 
patience, and grant us great victory. May God protect our 
people, Army, and nation from adversity and mischief. May God 
grant us victory over the infidels. Amen. You are the 
cherisher and sustainer of the world. 
  We beseech God to bestow his mercy on the souls of the 
martyrs who fell in the Mother of Battles and the al-Qadisiyah 
battle, and on all of our righteous martyrs, who fell to uphold 
honor, the national cause, and principles. We beseech God to 
bestow his mercy on the Arab nation's martyrs, who fell along 
the path of struggle, jihad, and fateful battles. 
  Long live our glorious Arab nation. May its message remain 
eternal. 
  Long live Palestine as a free Arab country. Long live 
Palestine. Long live Iraq. Long live Iraq. God is great. God 
is great. God is great. And may the lowly be accursed. 
  May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you, brothers 
and friends.

  [Text] The Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] Liaison 
Group session on Bosnia-Herzegovina concluded in Geneva with an 
18-point statement. In it, the foreign ministers in the group 
expressed their opposition to the occupation of the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by means of force, aggression, ethnic 
cleansing, and genocide and called for the return of refugees, 
homeless, and POW's to their homes. 
  In the statement, the ministers reiterated the willingness 
of 
some ICO member countries to provide peacekeeping forces under 
the aegis of the United Nations. Our colleague in Paris has 
sent us a report on the statement and the meetings of Foreign 
Minister Dr. Velayati: 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] In the 
statement, the Islamic countries again stressed their 
categorical and urgent call to the United Nations to lift the 
arms embargo against the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina and to 
terminate the siege of Sarajevo. 
  Dr. Velayati, who is in Geneva to participate in the 
session, 
met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic on Monday [17 January] 
night. Izetbegovic described the peace proposals presented to 
the Muslims as unjust and criticized the international 
community's lack of support for ensuring the Bosnian Muslims' 
interests in these talks. He stated: The Serbs are perpetrating 
atrocities but are in a far better position than us. 
  Dr. Velayati stressed that for most Western countries, the 
term peace has lost its meaning as noble and just and he 
appraised Izetbegovic of his talks with the UN secretary 
general. At the conclusion of the Liaison Group session, Dr. 
Velayati met Butrus-Ghali and again stressed that Iran is 
willing to dispatch 5,000-10,000 peacekeeping troops to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. He accused the Security Council of 
inattention toward the genocide of Bosnian Muslims and a lack of 
definite action against the Serbs. [end recording]

  [Text] A spokesman of the Foreign Office described Indian 
press reports as fabricated and motivated. The reports were 
published recently in a section of the Indian press and alleged 
that the Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] of Pakistan is 
carrying out terrorist activities from Bangladeshi soil. 
Speaking in Dhaka today, he said these concocted reports were 
published in Indian newspapers at a time when both Bangladesh 
and India are making efforts to forge closer ties between them 
on the basis of mutual understanding. The spokesman said that 
such motivated news will obstruct the development of a cordial 
relationship between the two neighboring countries. He 
expressed the hope that they will refrain from creating this 
type of unrealistic propaganda.

  [Text] Riyadh, Jan 16, SPA -- The Gulf Cooperation Counicl 
(GCC) and the United States held a meeting here today under the 
co-chairmanship of Saudi Commerce Minister Sulayman al-Sulayyim, 
and U.S. Trade Secretary Ronald Brown. 
  The meeting was attended by GCC delegations and senior 
officials. 
  At the beginning of the meeting, the Saudi minister welcomed 
the participants and expressed his sincere wishes that their 
visit would boost U.S.-GCC economic dialogue. 
  He expressed appreciation for the U.S. people and government 
for their support during the Gulf crisis and stressed that "our 
joint effort to support international legitimacy" had led to the 
liberation of Kuwait. 
  He confirmed the GCC desire to enhance economic cooperation 
with the United States to coincide with excellent political and 
strategic relations between the two sides. 
  He expressed satisfaction with the development of trade 
between the U.S. and the GCC and pointed out that today's 
meeting would help expand and diversify trade exchange. 
  "I would like to cease [as received] this opportunity to 
congratulate the U.S. Government on successfully concluding the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and I would also 
like to express our complete satisfaction with the outcome of 
the Uruguay round of international trade negotiations," 
al-Sulayyim said adding that these two accomplishments were two 
steps on the right path towards a more liberated world trade 
order. 
  He said GCC states firmly believe in the freedom of trade 
and 
keenly follow up the growth of world trade and are seriously 
considering joining the GATT agreement. 
  He said the Kingdom has officially applied for GATT 
membership and expressed hope that the U.S. would support this 
request. He also pointed out that Bahrain has recently joined 
the GATT. 
  He also confirmed the keenness of GCC states on the 
protection of copy rights and the facilitation of resolving 
trade disputes. He pointed in this connection to the decision 
by the recent GCC summit to set up a commercial arbitration 
center and a previous summit's decision to approve the patent 
system and set up an office for the protection of copy rights. 
  Dr. al-Sulayyim expressed hope that these measures would 
encourage and protect direct U.S. investments in GCC states and 
said he was looking forward to negotiations on a legal formula 
for an agreement on the protection and encouragement of 
exchanged investments in the United States and GCC countries. 
  Turning to the field of energy, he said it was an important 
sector of GCC-U.S. cooperation and stressed that their bilateral 
dialogue had led to exchanging information and evaluating this 
important sector. 
  He said the GCC, as a main source of producing hydrocarbon 
energy, and the United States, main consumer, have a joint 
interest in establishing healthy and stable energy markets. He 
said their joint efforts in this field would give a positive 
signal to the energy industry to encourage investments and meet 
future international demand. 
  However, he expressed GCC [word indistinct] about growing 
trends in consumer countries to place more hurdles in the face 
of energy trade with the excuse of protecting the environment. 
  He said GCC states agree with this noble goal but do not 
believe that prejudice against oil for the sake of other more 
polluting energy sources is required or justified. 
  "That is why we look forward to the understanding and 
empathy 
of our friends in the United States for this legitimate 
concern," he said. 
  Brown addressed the meeting confirming that GCC states and 
the U.S. have joint economic interests. 
  He said GCC states look forward to new industries and the 
U.S. looks forward to new markets. He added that GCC states aim 
to attract international investments to realize security and the 
U.S. aims to reach security by increasing investments outside 
its borders. 
  He stressed that their joint efforts could lead to an 
unusually successful economic cooperation. 
  He expressed confidence that current meetings and talks 
between the U.S. and the GCC would increase their chances to 
found more liberated markets and closer cooperation. 
  He underlined the importance of U.S. efforts to reach an 
international agreement on the GATT and confirmed that the 
Clinton administration aims to realize a more open and active 
international economy and pointed to current negotiation between 
the U.S. and Japan to reach a trade balance between them. 
  He added that the United States has realized that its 
national security is linked to its economic security and that is 
why it has expanded its international relations. 
  He said the return of peace to the Middle East stimulates 
hope to provide more freedom to devote resources to more 
economic development. 
  He also confirmed that economic development can bolster the 
stability of peace.

  [Text] New Delhi today categorically told Pakistan that it 
will not spare any effort to oppose moves against India's unity 
and territorial integrity. Rejecting the two nonpapers given by 
the Pakistan Foreign Office to the Indian high commissioner in 
Islamabad yesterday, New Delhi said the question of plebiscite 
in any part of India, including Jammu and Kashmir, simply does 
not arise. Terming the non-papers as Pakistan's propaganda, a 
spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry said in New Delhi 
today that the exercise is an attempt to obscure the realities 
of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. He said that violence in 
the state is being created by militants and foreign mercenaries 
trained and equipped by Pakistan to erode the territorial 
integrity and political stability of India. Recalling New 
Delhi's repeated call upon Pakistan to desist from sponsoring 
trans-border terrorism, he said India has the will and the 
commitment of the people of Jammu and Kashmir to counter the 
violence generated by militants with external support.

  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 7 -- Armed forces of Pakistan and 
the U.S. have begun a five-week-long joint exercise in the 
rugged mountains north of Peshawar. The objectives include 
preparing both Pakistani and American troops for 
highly-specialised high-altitude warfare, say military experts 
here. 
  It is learnt that 150 U.S. commandos arrived in Islamabad on 
Thursday [January 6] to commence the exercises. Besides 
imparting training to their Pakistani counterparts, U.S. troops, 
too, will gain considerable experience in high-altitude warfare 
from these exercises, since the terrain chosen is ideal for this 
purpose. 
  Military observers in Delhi have expressed concern that the 
expertise gained by Pakistani troops from these exercises could 
have a bearing on the future of the Siachen dispute. However, 
it is learnt that last year also a similar joint exercise was 
conducted. Its continuance for a second year in succession is 
indicative of the U.S.'s growing military cooperation with 
Pakistan, experts say. 
  Highly-placed sources here said that the Americans have 
clarified that not many U.S. soldiers are participating in the 
mutual training scheme and too much significance should not be 
attached to the matter. 
  It has, however, been confirmed that troops belonging to 
certain special units of the U.S. Central Command will be taking 
part in the programme which is being conducted on the southern 
slopes of the mighty Hindukush ranges. 
  Sources here also revealed that the Chief of Army Staff, Gen 
B.C. Joshi, had advised his senior officers not to get unduly 
alarmed over this development. The Indian Air Force is also 
learnt to share this perception. 
  Yet, coming in the wake of a succession of anti-lndian 
statements from the Clinton Administration and given its clear 
"tilt" towards Pakistan in South Asian affairs, many officials 
in Delhi are understandably worried by the latest development 
which comes just after the failure of the Foreign Secretary 
level talks between India and Pakistan. 
  A source in the Army, however, discounted the possibility of 
Pakistan being able to overrun Indian positions in the Siachen 
glacier with the help of U.S. training. "We are considered 
Number One in high altitude warfare by one and all," he said. 
  He pointed out that past efforts by Pakistan to spring a 
surprise on Indian positions in Siachen (where temperatures 
range between 40 and 50 degrees below zero) had been effectively 
beaten back. Both the Pakistani army and air force got a bloody 
nose in their attempt to dislodge Indians from their militarily 
superior position on the glacier. 
  Military experts here feel that the joint high altitude 
exercise could, nevertheless, be mutually beneficial. The U.S. 
Army may be aiming for combat readiness for such warfare in view 
of changing geo-political realities in mountainous Central Asia. 
  Both Pakistan and the U.S. have a strong interest in the 
region in today's post-USSR scenario. The entire region has 
become volatile and politically unstable following the carving 
out of independent, mainly Islamic, republics. Clearly, the 
Americans see Central Asia as a potential trouble spot for the 
future and want to be in readiness to face any eventuality.

<F P=106> [By Chandan Mitra] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, 8 Jan. -- External Affairs Ministry 
officials are surprised rather than disturbed over the US-Pak 
joint military exercises for high altitude warfare training. 
The five-week-long programme involving crack commandos of the 
U.S. Army has just begun near Peshawar. 
  "It is ironic that the U.S. is participating in this high 
altitude warfare training programme, which can only help the 
Pakistani Army gain more experience regarding the ongoing 
conflict over Siachen," a South Block source said. The irony is 
that the U.S. had quite recently urged India and Pakistan to end 
their stand off, offering even to underwrite a mutual withdrawal 
from the glacier. 
  It is learnt that the Clinton Administration had been 
pressing India to withdraw its forces from Siachen and come to 
an agreement with Pakistan. This was part of Washington's move 
to promote "confidence building measures" between the two 
countries. 
  Sources here revealed that the U.S. had gone so far as to 
say 
that it would provide the "necessary underpinnings" for 
de-escalation of the stand-off in Siachen. In plain terms, this 
meant that Washington was prepared to even monitor compliance to 
any agreement between New Delhi and Islamabad. 
  But any monitoring of the demilitarisation of Siachen by the 
U.S. would have involved the presence of foreign military 
personnel in Kashmir. This was not something India was prepared 
to accept. Interestingly Pakistan, too, is believed to have 
rejected the U.S. plan, making it clear that the problem would 
have to be resolved bilaterally. 
  MEA [Ministry of External Affairs] sources revealed that 
contrary to media reports, the Siachen dispute came up for 
discussion when India's Foreign Secretary Mr J.N. Dixit, met his 
Pakistani counterpart, Mr Shahryar Khan, in Islamabad earlier 
this month. It has been agreed that discussions would continue 
for the resolution of the problem, but both countries are 
against foreign intervention. 
  Indian officials say that although Kashmir itself is 
probably 
not high on Washington's diplomatic agenda worldwide, a series 
of statements and actions emanating from the U.S. Capital 
indicate that President Clinton has adopted a more activist 
posture with regard to South and Central Asia. 
  This has caused concern in the neighbourhood, which is clear 
from the recent Chinese statement opposing a "third option" 
(that is, independence) for Kashmir. Clearly, Beijing feels 
that the U.S. has some interest in floating the "third option" 
idea. 
  There is also considerable bewilderment here regarding the 
reasons for the U.S. Army to train itself for high altitude 
warfare. Indian officials are of the view that while the Central 
Asia angle cannot be ruled out, Americans would be foolhardy to 
even contemplate a military role, now or in the future, in this 
region. 
  At the same time, American intelligence agencies are learnt 
to be deeply involved in the Central Asia region, comprising 
former Soviet Republics. In a real life enactment of a John Le 
Carre type scenario, a former chief of the KGB in Afghanistan 
was murdered in mysterious circumstances recently. 
  Close on its heels, a CIA operative in Ukraine was shot dead 
allegedly by a drunken guard. Later it was discovered that the 
CIA man had been neatly shot through his neck at point blank 
range, which ruled out the "drunken guard" explanation. 
  Experts here say that despite the end of Cold War, the U.S. 
and Russia are currently engaged in a tussle for control over 
the Central Asian region. Russia's strategy is to ensure that 
any future military conflict, or even civil strife on its 
peripheries does not spill over into the Russian mainland. To 
achieve this aim, it wants to exercise some degree of control, 
through military presence is necessary, over its former 
republics. The CIS system has been designed precisely for this 
purpose. 
  The Americans, on the other hand, want to undermine Russian 
influence, first over the East European States and then on 
Central Asia. As part of this strategy, Washington is trying to 
rope in the East European States under the NATO umbrella. This 
has been strongly opposed by the Russians who fear that Western 
forces would be on their doorsteps if the NATO expansion plan 
succeeds. 
  Thus, the mounting American interest in Kashmir needs to be 
viewed in the larger global perspective, analysts in Delhi feel. 
The increasingly interventionist posture of the U.S., however, 
is putting immense pressure on India which is keen to resolve 
its problems with Pakistan through bilateral discussion. 
  "We understand each other's compulsions. For example, we 
realise that Ms. Benazir Bhutto has certain domestic reasons for 
her current belligerence. The Pakistanis, in turn, know that no 
Indian Government can possibly negotiate the status of Kashmir. 
It is, therefore, in our mutual interest to de-escalate 
conflict situations, so that no third party can seek to 
intervene," an official explained. 
  MEA officials also say that the recent Foreign 
Secretary-level talks in Islamabad have not been as much of a 
failure as initial reports suggested. They point to a statement 
by the Pakistan President, Mr. Farooq Leghari, in Karachi this 
week which commended the resumption of the dialogue and stressed 
that this must continue.

  [Text] The minister of state for home, Mr. Rajesh Pilot, 
said that there was a strong evidence of ISI's [Inter-Services 
Intelligence] involvement in terrorist acts in the country. He 
said the same forces are now creating trouble in the 
northeastern states by sneaking into the country from the 
Bangladesh border. Mr. Pilot was addressing a press conference 
in Hyderabad today. The minister said the gang whose members 
were arrested recently in connection with bomb blasts at several 
places was operating from Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and 
Hyderabad. He said Dawood Ibrahim, who is the kingpin behind 
these incidents, is still at large and efforts are being made at 
all levels for his extradition. 
  The minister also took salute at the passing out parade of 
the 11th batch of assistant commandants of the Central 
Industrial Security Force.

  [Text] India on Wednesday [12 January] protested to 
Bangladesh for allowing Pakistan's intelligence agency, 
Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), to operate from its soil, 
even as a high-power delegation led by Home Secretary N.N. Vohra 
was currently in Nepal canvassing for cooperation to strengthen 
border vigilance. 
  India's concern over the happenings in the neighbouring 
countries stems from reports that these are being used as 
conduits for pushing in arms and ammunition into the border 
areas. 
  In the case of Bangladesh, there is an additional problem of 
illegal immigration causing population explosion in the border 
districts of Bihar and West Bengal and social tensions in other 
areas, including Delhi. 
  The protest to Bangladesh was made by Prakash Singh, 
Director-General of Border Security Force (BSF), at the 
Indo-Bangladesh coordination meeting which concluded here on 
Wednesday. 
  The Bangladesh delegation was led by Mohammad Anwar Hossain, 
Director-General, Bangladesh Rifles. 
  Prakash Singh raised the issue of illegation [as published] 
immigration from Bangladesh and insisted on the implementation 
of the September 1991 agreement between the two countries. 
  He conveyed the Government's strong feelings on the subject 
of assistance to insurgent groups from the North-East in 
Bangladesh. 
  Reliable sources said the Bangladesh delegation contested 
the 
BSF chief's arguments. It reportedly argued that India had 
pushed many people into Bangladesh merely on the suspicion of 
their being illegal immigrants. 
  As a consequence, the meeting did not yield any clue to 
solving the burning problem of illegal immigration. 
  However, there was agreement on two issues: one, that the 
undemarcated 50 kms of Indo-Bangladesh border be demarcated at 
the earliest, and the other that the work of repair and 
maintenance of boundary pillars along the international border 
should be taken over by the security forces of the two countries. 
  It was decided that the two security forces would be 
requesting their respective governments to issue directions to 
surveyors-general to complete the demarcation of the boundary. 
  In this context, the dispute in the Mahurichar area was also 
discussed. India's argument was that on the basis of 
Indo-Bangladesh agreement of 1974 the boundary in this area was 
along the course of Mahuri river. 
  On the other hand, Bangladesh insisted that the cultivation 
on the Indian side should be stopped. India did not favour this 
proposal saying that the 1974 agreement related to alignment of 
the border and not utilisation of land on either side. 
  Given this background it was obviously only as a matter of 
courtesy that the two sides agreed that the security forces of 
both sides should exercise utmost restraint and that they should 
coordinate their efforts to curb smuggling and other criminal 
activities along the border. 
  The Vohra-led delegation is visiting Nepal after a thorough 
on-the-spot study of the situation in the border districts of 
Bahraich and Maharajgan in UP [Uttar Pradesh]. 
  Vohra had convened a meeting of top officials of these two 
districts as well as those of Siddharath Nagar, Pilibhit and 
Gonda districts. He personally visited several checkposts in the 
border areas along with heads of intelligence agencies. 
  The Government has been concerned about the influx of Punjab 
extremists in UP.

  [Text] Libyan President [title as published] Mu'ammar al- 
Qadhdhafi has asked for an urgent summit meeting with President 
Husni Mubarak to end the current coolness in Egyptian-Libyan 
relations which followed the disappearance in Cairo of the 
Libyan opposition figure Mansur al-Kikhya. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi has sent a personal message to President 
Mubarak, informing him of Libya's commitment not to touch Libyan 
opposition figures who reside in or have been granted asylum in 
Egypt. 
  Libya has informed Cairo that it was not involved in 
al-Kikhya's disappearance on 10 December 1993 either directly or 
indirectly. Libyan Embassy sources noted that the investigations 
carried out by Egyptian security agencies have not pointed a 
finger at anyone. 
  Egyptian Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi 
submitted a report to President Mubarak about the circumstances 
surrounding al-Kikhya's disappearance.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 19 Jan (MENA)--An official source at the 
Ministry of Interior has stated that the sweeps carried out by 
the security forces in southern Cairo early this morning 
resulted in the wounding of terrorist Muhammad Ahmad Farhan, a 
fugitive sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor in the 
Zinhum incident and sentenced to 15 years in another case for 
possessing explosives. 
  The source added that the wounded terrorist was involved in 
the attack against the Majdah movie theater in Hulwan, as well 
as the recent attack against a tourist bus in Misr al-Qadimah. 
  The terrorist was caught in possession of an automatic 
rifle, 
a large amount of ammunition, and $5,000. 
  Another terrorist was apprehended in the sweeps. Samir 
Isma'il Salih, a Palestinian national studying at the al-Azhar 
Institute in Hiliyat al-Zaytun, is one of the very dangerous 
elements trained in using weapons. He took part in the attack 
against a tourist bus in Misr al-Qadimah. [passage omitted] 
  Sayyid 'Abd-al-Fattah of the Special Forces was martyred in

<F P=106> [Report by Hamid al-Alfi from al-'Arish] </F>
  [Text] As part of their campaign to seize weapons and 
explosives and arrest terrorists, the north Sinai intelligence 
agencies have seized 20 weapons -- including a mortar gun, an 
antiaircraft gun, 26 kg of dynamite, 25 hand grenades, and 35 
dynamite sticks -- along with their owners. The search 
campaign, which was conducted on instructions from Interior 
Minister Hasan al- Alfi, is intended to confront all terrorists 
and criminals. The campaign was supervised by Major General 
Sami Katat, assistant to the interior minister for north Sinai 
security, and led by Brigadier General Muhammad Abu-Shu'ayshi', 
director of the Intelligence Department. Colonels Hilmi 
al-Shanhabi, Budayr al-Qasir, and Ahmad Antus took part in the 
campaign. 
  In addition to the weapons, the campaign uncovered nine 
cases 
of robberies, 130 cases of car smuggling, three cases of drug 
trafficking and cultivating, eight cases of financial fraud, and 
five cases of forgery of foreign currencies. In addition, 182 
suspects were arrested and referred to the State Security 
Intelligence Department. The campaign uncovered 42 cases of 
alcohol smuggling and prostitution, 1,106 cases of evasion of 
verdicts, 25 cases of illegal supplies, 1,193 traffic tickets, 
and 89 other cases. The defendants have been referred to the 
Public Prosecution Office, which has started interrogations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi by Nabil </F>
Zaki; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Zaki] The government has repeatedly affirmed 
that terrorism has been eliminated and terrorists have been 
liquidated, but citizens were surprised by a serious escalation 
of terrorist operations, including an attempt to assassinate the 
prime minister. Do the security agencies have enough information 
on the terrorist networks, I mean information that indicates the 
actual magnitude of the problem? 
  [Al-Alfi] Currently they are concentrating on gathering the 
information. I can affirm that gathering and analyzing 
information is not limited to just inside Egypt but has expanded 
to include information on terrorist activities abroad. There is 
coordination among all police agencies in this regard. 
  As for statements on eliminating terrorism, I do not imagine 
we will eradicate and uproot the crime for good because crime 
has existed since man was created, since Cain and Abel. 
[passage omitted] 
  We must be prepared to confront violence and terrorism. The 
reason behind the latest escalation is that the terrorist groups 
target not only Egypt but also all the Arab and Islamic 
countries. It has been noticed that the extremists and deviants 
have nothing to do with religion; they use religion as a pretext 
and use people with confused thinking in return for money. This 
was evident during investigations into recent cases. Besides, 
we do not wait for a terrorist act to happen and then react. 
  [Zaki] Does this mean that the initiative is now in the 
hands 
of security agencies? 
  [Al-Alfi] We no longer wait for a terrorist act to happen 
and 
then react. The initiative is now in our hands. Information is 
bound to flow to the security authorities now that the means of 
obtaining such information have been modernized. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Zaki] Don't you agree that there is slackness on the part 
of 
the security officials in protecting a public opposition figure, 
such as former Libyan minister Mansur al-Kikhya? 
  [Al-Alfi] First, Mansur al-Kikhya is a refugee in another 
country and not in Egypt. He did not take refuge in Egypt. We 
protect the refugees we have. As for al-Kikhya, he holds 
several nationalities and came to Egypt on an Algerian passport 
to participate in a conference of the Arab Human Rights 
Organization in Cairo. After the conference ended, he stayed on 
in the Safir Hotel without informing the authorities concerned. 
  [Zaki] Didn't he tell anyone? 
  [Al-Alfi] He came to participate in a conference of the Arab 
Human Rights Organization. He did not come as a refugee. We 
carried out our task to provide full security for the conference 
and nothing happened during the conference sessions. Al-Kikhya 
went to Alexandria for two days during the first week after the 
conference ended and returned to Cairo. During this time, some 
people contacted him asking to meet him and from then on he 
acted on his own. Intense security investigations are under way 
to learn about his movements during the week following the 
conference. To be precise, we must say that al-Kikhya did not 
come to us as a refugee but to attend a conference whose 
sessions were provided with full security. Investigations are 
continuing into those persons who met him last and into his 
movements and the places he frequented. 
  [Zaki] When Major General Hasan al-Alfi took responsibility 
for the Ministry of Interior, many people, including me, 
expected that this would put an end to any torture inside 
prisons and detention centers in Egypt. It was noticed that the 
government agreed to host the conference of the Arab Human 
Rights Organization in Cairo for the first time, which is a 
great development. Mr. Minister, is the talk about torture 
still existing in Egypt true? 
  [Al-Alfi] If there are excesses, they must be individual 
cases and not a common state practice. If such individual 
excesses have occurred, the perpetrators were questioned and 
some were actually put on trial. Judicial sentences were also 
passed against some and others were acquitted. Those who were 
sentenced are still serving their terms and some of them stood 
trial before a disciplinary court that punished them. These are 
individual acts and not part of the practices of the state, 
government, or the agency. 
  [Zaki] Is that not policy? 
  [Al-Alfi] Of course not. The recent persistent talk on this 
issue falls within the context of collusion between those who 
perpetrate acts of violence and terrorism and their defenders to 
confuse the situation and frustrate those who pursue and arrest 
the terrorists. Their aim is also to tarnish the image of 
police to delay them and limit their action. [passage omitted] 
  [Zaki] It is said that a large number of convicted people 
are 
at large. 
  [Al-Alfi] We have established a new department for this 
purpose. I believe that the police and judiciary's efforts are 
worthless if sentences against wrongdoers and convicts are not 
implemented. Hence, I set up a specialized department to 
implement the sentences, coordinate with courts, and follow up 
on sentences. Its task is also to coordinate with all the 
authorities that have fugitive convicts and suspects in pending 
court cases. It is a strong agency that has been provided with 
all facilities to arrest suspects and convicted fugitives, and 
we have achieved good results. [passage omitted]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-SHA'B in Arabic in its issues 
of 11 and 14 January carries several articles highlighting an 
apparent dispute between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Labor 
Party in connection with a recent call by the government for a 
dialogue with the opposition and the opposition's response to it. 
  In a 1,500-word article on page 5 of the 11 January edition, 
Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi notes that the 
Brotherhood welcomes the call for national dialogue and refers 
to the consensus among political parties and other political 
forces that "political reform is the true introduction to any 
earnest reformation of our dear country's affairs." 
  He expresses astonishment at published statements saying 
that 
the dialogue will be restricted to five political parties the 
representatives of which will talk with the National Democratic 
Party's [NDP] representatives and that some political forces, 
notably the Muslim Brotherhood, have been excluded, at least 
from the initial stages of the dialogue. 
  He asks: "Who permitted these parties to speak for the 
nation and the people or even to speak for other political 
parties and forces, some of which, notably the Muslim 
Brotherhood, have a real presence in several associations and 
institutions, a presence that rivals--even exceeds--the 
political weight and influence of these parties? I am afraid 
the gambit has succeeded and the government's party [NDP] has 
lured other parties into doing exactly the same thing they used 
to criticize the government and its party for doing. Each of 
these parties used to proclaim, for all the world to hear, that 
those who can speak on behalf of the people or make decisions 
pertaining to any public affair must be freely elected by the 
people in an integrated democratic process. How can these 
parties now participate in choosing the delegates to a 
conference that will discuss political, economic, and 
intellectual problems, et cetera? Is it enough to bestow 
legitimacy on them that the delegates are chosen by six 
political parties?" 
  Al-Hudaybi continues: "We say frankly that each of these six 
political parties represents only itself." 
  He cites the Wafd Party's newspaper [AL-WAFD] as reporting 
on 
8 January 1994 that the 12 licensed political parties represent 
only 15 percent of the groups that speak for the nation. 
  In a special 300-word message to Labor Party Secretary 
General 'Adil Husayn published inside a box below the AL-SHA'B 
article, al- Hudaybi blames him for ignoring the Muslim 
Brotherhood in a recent article in which Husayn spoke of the 
need for political reform to enable the legal political parties 
to participate in elections. 
  Al-Hudaybi says: "I found that you limited the issue of 
political reform to expediting the exercise of political rights 
(elections). You repeatedly said that the elections should be 
held with the participation of what you called the legal 
parties. You did not say one word about the need to recognize 
other political forces, notably the Muslim Brotherhood. Your 
party carried it to the People's Assembly and it carried your 
party to the People's Assembly in the 1987 election. The same 
happened during the local elections of 1992. The Brotherhood 
established an Islamic alliance with your party, contesting the 
elections under the slogan 'Islam is the Solution.' This was 
originally a Muslim Brotherhood slogan." 
  Al-Hudaybi adds: "You also referred in your article to the 
State Security detectives' pursuit of the members of what you 
described as the legitimate parties. You did not say one word 
about their pursuit of and injustice to other political forces, 
as if you believe that these forces--not having obtained what 
you refer to as legitimacy--have no immunity and that their 
pursuit and confiscation of their means of livelihood no longer 
concern you, and that this is why you neglected to refer to them 
in any of the 10 principles mentioned in your article." 
  'Adil Husayn responds in a 700-word message published inside 
a box on page 5 of the 14 January edition of AL-SHA'B addressed 
to: "My brother Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi." 
  He says he can find no explanation for al-Hudaybi's remark 
that the political parties represent only themselves and reminds 
him that in their statement responding to the government's call 
for dialogue, the political parties agreed that the leaders and 
accredited representatives of the political parties and forces 
would take part in the dialogue. He advises him to resist the 
attempt to exclude the Muslim Brotherhood but not to reject the 
very idea of dialogue among the political parties and forces and 
the ruling party. 
  He declares: "Honorable brother, my opinion is known. It is 
that the Muslim Brotherhood must participate in any earnest 
political dialogue as an independent body, not via another 
party." 
  He adds: "It is strange that you should infer from my 
discussion of the legal guarantees we are demanding for the 
political parties that I am permitting the persecution of the 
Muslim Brotherhood. My dear sir, we are seeking to expand 
democracy so that the political forces that have not been 
recognized can be recognized, since they do have an undeniable 
presence." 
  Husayn expresses dissatisfaction with the "tone" of 
al-Hudaybi's article from "beginning to end." 
  He continues: "I did not feel comfortable with what you said 
about the Islamic alliance, particularly that the slogan 'Islam 
is the solution' is the Muslim Brotherhood's exclusive slogan. 
Actually it is the slogan of Muslims everywhere and in every 
age." 
  Husayn ends his response with a reference to the Labor 
Party's long-established Islamic credentials and addresses 
al-Hudaybi: "Concluding, my brother Counselor: The enemies of 
Islam are lying in wait for its advocates and concocting plots 
and sedition. We must be wary and vigilant. I still believe 
that what joins us together is the declaration: There is no God 
but God and Muhammad is his messenger. This is much more 
important than any differences between us. Brother counselor, I 
pray that God will clear the differences between you and me 
according to righteousness. May this chapter be closed."

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 19 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first 
Foreign Ministry under secretary and director of the President's 
Office for Political Affairs, has stated that the summit between 
Presidents al-Asad and Clinton was very important and that the 
Egyptian Government was aware of this from the beginning. 
  In an interview with Egyptian television on the "Good 
Morning 
Egypt" program today, Dr. al-Baz said that President Mubarak had 
a role in convening this meeting and in pushing matters forward. 
The meeting was held without delay because Egypt realized that 
such a meeting could produce positive results. 
  He added that Egypt is working toward one comprehensive 
agreement and not just agreements on some fronts. He stressed 
that Syria is one of the important parties in the peace process 
and that without movement on the Syrian track progress on the 
other tracks could be slow. 
  Dr. al-Baz said that the al-Asad-Clinton summit has had a 
positive impact, but this does not mean that an agreement was 
reached on specific issues to which Israel and Syria would be 
committed. The overall atmosphere and the assurances that could 
have been made in this meeting will, in our view, result in 
progress on the Syrian track. Dr. al-Baz expressed the hope 
that progress will be made on the Syrian track in the next few 
months. 
  Regarding Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's visit to 
Cairo tomorrow, Thursday, Dr. al-Baz said that this meeting is 
also important because, despite the signing of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, first in Oslo on 
20 August and then in Washington on 13 September, the 
declaration is general and negotiations are needed to ensure its 
implementation. These negotiations are extremely important. 
[passage omitted] 
  Dr. al-Baz also discussed the domestic situation. He 
emphasized that among President Mubarak's priorities is finding 
solutions to economic problems, particularly unemployment and 
price increases. Plans to upgrade education are also at the top 
of his priorities. 
  Concluding his interview, Dr. al-Baz said that attention is 
now being focused on internal and external issues to improve the 
internal situation.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Jan (MENA)--AL-AHRAM newspaper affirms 
that the available evidence on the al-Asad-Clinton summit in 
Geneva indicates that it was a good step toward stimulating the 
peace process, especially on the Syrian track, which has been 
inactive lately. 
  In its editorial Friday, the paper says that this is the 
first time that a genuine opportunity exists to normalize 
relations between Syria and Israel and that the ball is now in 
Israel's court. Israel, it adds, should respond to Syria's clear 
and forthright willingness to normalize relations with that 
country under a final peace accord. The paper calls on Israel 
to declare whether it is prepared for a complete withdrawal from 
the Golan. 
  In light of this, the paper notes, it can be said that the 
al- Asad-Clinton summit has been successful and that it will 
hold the door wide open for positive developments in the 
negotiations in Washington next week. Accordingly, the paper 
adds, we can say that 1994 will be a year of peace between Syria 
and Israel, which deserves to be called the peace of the brave.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Text] Al-SHA'B has learned that the U.S. Administration 
has conveyed a memorandum to some regional Arab countries 
containing the details of a U.S. plan that aims to exterminate 
Islamic fundamentalists this year. According to the memorandum, 
the step will be coordinated between the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency (C.I.A) [abbreviation in English] and the 
security services in these Arab countries. 
  The memorandum stressed that the cycle of fundamentalist 
terrorism has started to threaten particular regimes. It called 
for increasing financial aid by 30 percent to confront terrorism 
in the region. The U.S. plan calls for the following: 
  1. Signing a security agreement between the Arab countries 
and the United States on confronting religious terrorism; 
  2. Letting U.S. intelligence teams stay in the Arab 
countries permanently to survey the activities of the terrorist 
fundamentalists; 
  3. Intensifying punishment of detained terrorists; 
  4. Cornering [muhasarat] those states that support and 
harbor terrorist fundamentalists politically and economically. 
This is a reference to Sudan and Iran; 
  5. Expressing U.S. readiness to earmark part of its economic 
and military aid, granted to particular countries in the region, 
for confronting fundamentalist terrorism; and 
  6. Taking joint Arab-U.S. steps to establish a joint 
security committee that will cooperate with the U.S. 
intelligence service to curb and wipe out terrorism.

  [Text] Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi [official spokesman of 
the Muslim Brotherhood] left for Amman on 12 January to visit 
his daughter, who has been married to a Jordanian physician for 
20 years. Al-Hudaybi was surprised when the Jordanian 
authorities banned him from entering without giving any reason. 
The Jordanian authorities even prevented him from seeing his 
daughter, who was waiting for him at the incoming passengers 
gate at the airport. Al- Hudaybi was forced to return to Egypt 
on the same plane. 
  This should have never taken place and should not pass 
unnoticed. The Egyptian authorities should have adopted a 
position and performed their duty in defense of the dignity of 
its nationals, particularly those who are prominent and 
well-known symbols. We hope that the Jordanian authorities will 
reconsider their position. It is an unacceptable attitude even 
if it was in retaliation for the Egyptian authorities' 
preventing Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahman Khalifah, general guide of 
the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood, from entering Egypt. This is 
also unacceptable behavior.

  [Text] Amman (Petra)--The Fourth Islamic-Christian Dialogue 
opened in Amman Tuesday [18 January] with a call from Jordan on 
scholars and laymen alike to safeguard religion as a source of 
justice and good deeds. 
  "We have a duty to isolate religion from and keep it safe 
against political upheavals, whims and changes so that the 
people will not lose confidence in their faith or suspect 
religious teachings," said Nasir-al-Din al-Asad, president of 
the Royal Academy for Islamic Civilisation Research (Al al-Bayt 
Foundation). 
  Deputising for His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the 
Regent, at the opening of the three-day meeting, Dr. al-Asad 
said Muslim scholars and the heads of the Christian faith have 
contributed towards bringing closer together the views of the 
two sides and achieving better understanding between them. 
  It is hoped that these dialogues in which many senior 
personalities from the two faiths and their societies 
participate would help scrutinise those issues that have 
remained outstanding and unclear and open the way for a better 
comprehension of the principles on which the two religions are 
based, said Dr. al-Asad. 
  Commenting on Jordan's endeavours to protect the holy places 
in Jerusalem under the Hashemite rule, Dr. al-Asad referred in 
particular to the recent royal decree for the formation of a 
commission to handle the affairs of the holy city, grouping 
Christian and Muslim individuals. 
  He noted that the present dialogue is dedicated to 
discussing 
religions' stand vis-a-vis nationalities, adding that religions 
do not conflict with nationalistic feelings, but rather advocate 
ending extremism, ethnic differences and other forms of 
conflicts. 
  Cardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Vatican Council on 
Promoting Relations with other faiths, who is attending the 
meetings, told the first session that Christianity does not 
oppose positive nationalities which do not oppose the law of 
God. Christianity, he said, rather opposes those feelings of 
superiority over other ethnic groups because such feelings 
transform nationality into oppressive movements that work 
against man and God. 
  A total of 65 scholars are participating in the discussions 
held at the King 'Abdallah Mosque in Amman. 
  They are all scholars from Jordan, Palestine, Iraq, Bosnia, 
Turkey, Senegal, Sudan, Morocco, Syria, Lebanon, the United 
Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia, Spain, Nigeria and France.

<F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok and On Levi] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israel is demanding in the Taba talks the 
setting up of a security belt around the Qatif Bloc settlements, 
which would increase the territory to be left under its control 
to 46 square kms. The Palestinians agree to Israeli control 
over an area of 19 to 20 square kms. It was finally agreed 
yesterday that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres will meet in Oslo on Saturday in a further attempt 
to break the deadlock in the Taba talks. 
  It was learned yesterday that contrary to announcements by 
Israeli spokesmen there is a sharp dispute between Israel and 
the Palestinians on the size of the Israeli autonomy area in the 
Qatif Bloc. Israel is demanding that in addition to the 
territories of the settlements and the areas in between them, it 
will have control of a security belt that would "wrap" the 
settlements from outside. Israel is demanding overall 46 square 
kms. The Palestinians are opposed to this and are agreeing to 
leaving some 19 to 20 square kms with Israel. [passage omitted] 
  The Security Committee in the Taba talks has still not found 
a compromise formula for control of the border crossings. Some 
progress was made in the Civilian Affairs Committee, headed by 
Brigadier General Gadi Zohar. It was decided to set up a single 
dialing area for the autonomy and to frank a Palestinian stamp. 
  Senior sources in the Israeli delegation said last night 
that 
"there would be no Israeli compromise on the crossings issue. 
Israel went a long way toward the Palestinians on that issue and 
we now expect them to show flexibility." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli 
delegation to the Taba talks, said a short while ago that the 
negotiations on the border crossings were stuck. Shahaq 
asserted that the disagreements between the parties centered on 
security arrangements at the crossings. Our correspondent 
Netan'el Semrik reports from Taba: 
  [Begin recording] [Semrik] Major General Amnon Shahaq, in 
his first public announcement this week, made it clear that the 
issue of the border crossings remained stuck. This, after an 
initial round of talks at Taba, the subsequent understandings 
reached at Oslo, Paris, and Cairo, and even after two days of 
negotiations at Taba this week. 
  [Shahaq] As for the security issues, we are still stuck on 
the issue of the border crossings. We are currently still 
trying to find ways to achieve maximum understanding and 
agreement; however, there are several matters of principle on 
which we disagree with the Palestinian delegation. We regard 
these issues as crucial to maintain the level of security we 
desire. There are several issues pertaining to the border 
crossings themselves which are tied to security arrangements. 
The disagreements between the two parties focus on these issues. 
  [Semrik] Do you think that the intervention of the prime 
minister and Yasir 'Arafat will be necessary on these issues? 
  [Shahaq] In my opinion, both parties are familiar with each 
other's position on the issue of the border crossings. We know 
what the Palestinians want and they know what we want. We have 
to find a way to agree or else there can be no accord. [end 
recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 19 January 
adds that "Major General Shahaq told our correspondent Moti Amir 
that the document detailing the points of agreement and 
disagreement between the two parties will be passed up to higher 
echelons. In the committee on civilian affairs, agreement was 
reached on transferring 25 out of the 35 Civil Administration 
offices to Palestinian control."]

  [Text] The Israeli Taba delegation is currently holding 
consultations after Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian 
delegation, submitted a new proposal regarding the border 
crossings issue. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports from Taba: 
  Over the last hour there were several developments here in 
Taba. At present there is a break in the discussions of the 
Security Affairs Committee. The Israeli representatives are 
holding consultations with Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of 
the Israeli delegation, and perhaps with Jerusalem as well, over 
a new proposal submitted by Dr. Nabil Sha'th a short time ago. 
  The Palestinian representatives in the committee were also 
summoned for consultations by Dr. Sha'th a short time ago. The 
only issue under discussion at the present time is the border 
crossings issue, which has been defined here as the key to all 
the security related issues under negotiations in Taba. 
  A senior source in the Palestinian delegation noted the new 
proposal on the border crossings issue submitted to Israel 
includes all the understandings attained in Oslo and Cairo, and 
is also based on the joint working paper formulated by 
representatives of the two delegations on the agreements and 
disagreements on this issue. According to the source the new 
proposal provides answers to all the security problems on the 
border crossings. In his opinion the Israeli representatives 
are delaying their answer to the proposal due to internal 
debates within the delegation, or due to other reasons which 
have to do with their desire to prevent the continuation of the 
discussions in the Security Affairs Committee. 
  According to the source, the Palestinian representatives in 
the committee have a full mandate from Yasir 'Arafat to attain 
an agreement on the border crossings issue. He added: This is 
precisely how we acted when we submitted the proposal and we do 
not need to ask Tunis anything. 
  Altogether it appears that the negotiations over the border 
crossings are stuck. Dr. Nabil Sha'th a short time ago 
confirmed he will travel to Cairo for a meeting with 'Arafat 
tomorrow morning. Later he will travel with 'Arafat to Oslo, 
where they are slated to meet Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on 
Friday [21 January]. Sha'th said that as far as he is concerned 
the committees can continue their work tomorrow without the 
attendance of the delegation heads. Incidentally, Maj. Gen. 
Shahaq will apparently also travel to the Oslo meeting.

of the Palestinian delegation to the Gaza-Jericho Committee, has 
stated that the Egyptian role is very important and something 
the Palestinians and the Israelis always want. 
  In a statement today, Dr. Sha'th said 'Arafat will ask 
President Husni Mubarak for Egyptian support for the peace 
process when they meet in Cairo tomorrow. 
  He pointed out that the Palestinian and Israeli delegations 
to the Security Affairs Committee reached no agreement on the 
crossings today. He noted that the Palestinian delegation 
submitted a written proposal setting out the points of agreement 
and disagreement on the crossings so that the two delegations 
would not have to discuss the issue from the beginning every 
time and so that the points of agreement and disagreement could 
be submitted to the political leaders of the two delegations to 
try to resolve them. The Israelis will respond to the 
Palestinian proposal tomorrow. 
  Dr. Sha'th said the Civilian Affairs Committee today 
discussed the water issue, saying that it is a difficult 
problem, particularly with regard to Gaza, requiring a concrete 
solution. 
  He affirmed that the Palestinian delegation submitted no new 
papers or proposals on the crossings in Gaza and Jericho or the 
border points between Egypt and Gaza and between Jordan and 
Jericho. He said the Israeli concept is that the crossings are 
an external security affair. Dr. Sha'th said this is the wrong 
interpretation and if they stick to it, it would be difficult to 
reach an agreement. He affirmed that the security at the 
crossings is a Palestinian and Israeli concern, not only 
Israeli. He explained that the crossings to Gaza and Jericho 
should be treated differently and that Israeli supervision 
should be inconspicuous, because Israel will withdraw from these 
two areas rather than the remaining parts of the West Bank. 
  He noted that Israel still has objections on this issue. And 
it has not agreed to place the crossings under international 
supervision. Dr. Sha'th affirmed that Israel is anxious about 
the results of the Geneva summit between Presidents Clinton and 
al-Asad. He said Israel is afraid that the U.S.-Syrian agreement 
will put pressure on it, pressure that will again steer the 
negotiations toward a comprehensive solution, as UN Security 
Council Resolution 242 called for Israeli withdrawal from all 
the occupied Arab territories, not part of them. The head of 
the Palestinian delegation said that despite the problems and 
obstacles facing the Gaza-Jericho Committee, the talks have not 
reached a stage requiring intervention by the United States as a 
cosponsor of the peace process in the area. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Taba, 19 Jan (MENA)--Jamil al-Turayfi, chairman of 
the Palestinian delegation to the Civilian Affairs Committee 
under the Gaza-Jericho Committee, has stated that tangible 
progress has been made in the work of the committee and that an 
agreement has been reached on transferring 25 functions from the 
Israeli to the Palestinian administration. 
  Speaking to reporters today, al-Turayfi said that an 
agreement on the transfer of four of these functions was reached 
at a meeting yesterday evening. These functions are: public 
works, natural preservations, arable land registration in Gaza, 
and civilian matters. 
  The Palestinian official added that no agreement has been 
reached so far on the transfer of 13 functions. They will be 
discussed during the next sessions. 
  Al-Turayfi noted that the Civilian Affairs Committee today 
began its discussion on the issue of transferring the water 
board authority from the Israeli to the Palestinian side. He 
believes that it will not be easy to reach an agreement on this 
matter in a single session. 
  Al-Turayfi affirmed that all the functions on which 
agreements were reached have been put in writing and signed by 
both sides. 
  Replying to a question on issuing Palestinian identification 
cards, he said that the committee has not completed its 
discussion of the issue and that it will be discussed during the 
next sessions. He noted that the committee will continue its 
works until Thursday evening. 
  In another development, 'Ami Gloska, official spokesman for 
the Israeli delegation, has stated that the two sides still 
disagree on certain points and that it is hard to tell when the 
talks will conclude. 
  Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff and chairman of 
the Israeli delegation to the Gaza-Jericho Committee, said that 
there are essential differences between the two sides on the 
points the Security Committee is discussing, particularly the 
issue of the crossing points. He said that the talks will 
continue until tomorrow evening in an attempt to resolve these 
differences.

  [Text] The Israeli and Palestinian delegations in Taba 
have drafted a joint document on the issue of the border 
crossings which specifies all the points of disagreement between 
the parties. Hasan 'Asfur, deputy head of the Palestinian 
delegation, said that the document will be relayed to the two 
leaderships for perusal. According to 'Asfur, over the weekend 
the PLO leadership will decide whether to change the directives 
given to the delegation and whether the negotiations will resume 
next week on the basis of this document. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 20 January 
carries a live report from Taba by Netan'el Semrik, adding that 
"the points of disagreement remain -- as previously -- the 
issues of symbols and procedures for checking those entering and 
departing the autonomy. The document itself is four-pages long 
and includes several dozens clauses and subclauses dealing with 
the various issues."] 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the Civilian 
Affairs 
Committee postponed the scheduled discussion regarding the 
establishment of television and radio stations because the 
Palestinian expert did not arrive in Taba.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikha'el Rosolio and Arye Kiesel] </F>
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, at the conclusion of the second week 
of the latest round of Taba talks, the heads of the Israeli and 
PLO Security Committees managed to arrive at a mutually 
acceptable document. The four-page paper sums up the agreements 
-- but primarily the disagreements -- pertaining to the border 
crossings problem. [passage omitted] 
  The following are some of the points specified in the paper: 
  -- The parties agree that anything that is decided with 
regard to the Allenby Bridge border crossing will also apply to 
the other border crossings. 
  -- It is agreed that all the existing border crossings, 
including the crossings from Jordan and Egypt into Israel, as 
well as the crossings from the Green Line into the territories, 
will remain where they are to be used as border crossings in the 
future. 
  -- The parties agree that the crossings will be manned by a 
policing force that will wear nonmilitary dress uniforms similar 
to those worn by the security inspectors at the Taba border 
crossing. 
  -- Israel and the PLO -- each one individually -- want their 
own control at the border crossings and reject any attempt to 
entrust the crossings to a foreign element, such as the United 
Nations. 
  This is where the agreements end and the disagreements 
begin: 
  -- The PLO wishes to separate the crossings into the 
territories from the crossings into Israeli territory and to 
assume full control over the crossings into the territories. 
  -- The PLO wishes to decide on its own and without Israeli 
dictates who will be allowed into the territories and how 
visitors passports will be stamped. 
  -- Alternatively, if a joint border crossing is operated, 
the 
PLO wants its security inspector to be the first to receive each 
person reaching the crossing point and to determine whether that 
person may pass through. The PLO representative will have no 
authority over Israelis but will be the decisive authority in 
the case of foreign tourists. 
  -- Flags: The PLO wants its flag to be flown at each border 
crossing. In the case of a joint border crossing, it will be 
flown next to the Israeli flag.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Dahlan, member of the Palestinian </F>
Security Committee to the PLO-Israel Taba negotiations, by radio 
correspondent Basim Abu-Sumayyah; from the "Today's Guest" 
program; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-Sumayyah] What are the tasks of the Security 
Committee in the negotiations? 
  [Dahlan] The Security Committee is part of the negotiating 
Palestinian delegation, which is divided into Civilian Affairs 
and Security Committees. The Security Committee is responsible 
for many issues. There are many personal opinions on the concept 
of the Taba talks Security Committee. However, the Security 
Committee discusses several important topics in the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. The first issue is the 
crossings, the second is the borders of the Jericho area, the 
third is the settlements and the areas in the Gaza Strip. There 
is also the security of roads and communication lines, the 
Palestinian security movements, and the security of the 
movements of the Israeli settlers on Palestinian roads and the 
mechanism of coordinating this matter between us and the Israeli 
police. These are the most important issues that were mentioned 
in the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles [DOP]. 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] It has been reported in the Israeli media 
that 
a coordination agreement has been reached between the Israeli 
and Palestinian security bodies. Can you tell us about that? 
  [Dahlan] First of all, it is the Israeli side which always 
raises the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian coordination or 
rather the Israeli-Palestinian security coordination. This is a 
serious issue. They are well aware that it creates confusion 
among the Palestinians inside and outside the occupied 
territory. So far, there are no issues agreed on between us and 
the Israelis. Even in the DOP, there is no agreement or 
substantive progress in security matters that I have already 
mentioned. 
  Some Israeli papers have reported that progress has been 
made 
or a security coordination agreement reached between the 
Palestinian and Israeli security bodies. I would like to say 
that this is a sheer lie. There is no official or unofficial 
coordination between us and the Israeli security. We do not 
expect that in the near future there will be coordination on the 
concept of security coordination between us and the Israelis. 
However, there are measures that require coordination between 
us and the Israelis, matters related to the implementation of 
the DOP. For instance, the issue of the Palestinian police 
force, its tasks and duties, its measures, crossing into or out 
of Israeli areas, crossing into or out of the border crossing 
points. These are interconnected issues which have something to 
do with coordinating measures related to the police. They are 
also related to security measures but these are matters for the 
future. So far, the issue has not been discussed. This matter 
is discussed between us and the Israelis in the Taba 
negotiations and within the issue of crossings. How the 
Palestinians from the West Bank inhabitants can enter. This is 
one point. The second is how the inhabitants of Gaza and 
Jericho can enter. 
  The recent clamor was created by the Israeli side and the 
Israeli media. This is being done in a systematic, carefully 
planned manner because they are perfectly aware of the 
seriousness of portraying the issue of Palestinian-Israeli 
security coordination at this stage as a fact. This is part of 
the psychological war launched by the Israelis to benefit from 
confusing us as a Palestinian side to the negotiations. To the 
Palestinian mind, the issue of security coordination or 
cooperation is very difficult to digest. Moreover, the question 
of acceptance and coordination between us and the Israelis does 
not exist. We cannot forget that we spent many years in jail. 
Our people suffered many years of occupation. But the Israelis 
raised this issue in a carefully thought out manner. They 
disseminated these false statements. A statement was issued in 
my name in one of the Israelis papers in which I was quoted as 
saying that there was security coordination between the Israeli 
and Palestinian security bodies. This was denied and the denial 
was circulated among the Palestinian centers to clarify the 
picture and avoid entering into the Israeli labyrinth which will 
hinder our progress in the negotiations. 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] Speaking about the crossings issue, which is 
a basic security issue, what is the latest in this regard? 
  [Dahlan] Discussion of the crossings issue is revolving in 
circles and is subject to various opinions. We hope a 
breakthrough will be realized in the crossings issue. The 
Israeli side wants to supervise the crossings from the 
administrative and security viewpoints. We also want 
administrative and security supervision. We would like to reach 
a compromise on this issue because this portrays the image of 
the Palestinian authority. We want the Palestinian citizen to 
know that a change has been effected in his life, that a 
Palestinian policeman is meeting him, that a Palestinian 
policeman is taking care of his administrative papers. We do not 
want the Palestinian citizens to face humiliation and oppression 
as has been the case in the past. At least we want coordination 
in all administrative matters that the Palestinians need on the 
crossing points in addition to some aspects of security 
measures, entry and departure as well as other issues that 
require coordination between us and the Israeli side. 
  However, the Israeli side has so far been insisting on a 
comprehensive security and administrative supervision of the 
crossings. Our position is clear and instructions by the 
brother president ['Arafat] on this issue are very clear. I do 
not think that any Palestinian will accept less than we are 
presenting at the negotiations table. 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] Last question. It has been reported recently 
that Israel links the question of releasing Palestinian 
detainees with the question of an amnesty by the Palestinians 
concerning collaborators with the Israeli authorities. What do 
you say to that? 
  [Dahlan] This question is also connected with the security 
coordination which was reported in the Israeli papers. This 
issue prompted the Israeli side to disseminate a fabricated 
statement attributed to me on the coordination issue. At that 
time I dealt with the collaborators. We said that the families 
and children of collaborators are Palestinians and we will take 
care of them from the social and financial viewpoints and will 
treat them just like other Palestinians. However, the issue of 
collaborators has always been and will continue to be a very 
sensitive subject for us. We are still adhering to our stand 
that this issue provokes our people. We will revise the issue of 
the agents. Those who deserve to remain among the Palestinians 
will be welcomed and we will ask the Israeli side to solve the 
problems related to those who do not deserve that. Let them take 
them to their areas, in the same way the Netherlands treated 
such people. 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Report by Hasan Abu-Zayid from Taba, from the "With the </F>
Events" program] 
  [Text] A round of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations was 
concluded in Taba this evening. On the Security Committee, 
which discussed the issue of border crossings, the Israeli and 
Palestinian sides have reached an agreement on a joint working 
paper specifying the points of agreement and disagreement 
concerning border crossings. In other words, there is no 
progress on the Security Committee's talks, and the border 
crossings remained the obstacle hindering any progress on this 
committee's talks. 'Ami Glusqa, spokesman for the Israeli 
delegation said that the two sides have drafted a joint working 
paper covering the two sides' stands on all that is related to 
the border crossings, which hinder any progress on the talks of 
the Security Committee. 
  At the end of the session, Hasan 'Asfur, deputy head of the 
Palestinian team, said that the problem of border crossings will 
be discussed again during the next round of talks on Monday [24 
January]. 
  [Begin recording] ['Asfur] The meetings were businesslike. A 
joint document has been drafted. We will start new discussions 
on these topics on Monday. The discussions are difficult. We 
do not expect speedy solutions. We are working hard to bridge 
the points of disagreement. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Does this mean the question of crossings will be 
discussed again in Taba? 
  ['Asfur] Next week, we will continue discussions on the 
question of crossings. This week's discussions on this issue 
were more businesslike than in the previous sessions. 
  [Abu-Zayid] What about other topics? 
  ['Asfur] There are others on the agenda, but we should 
finish 
this issue since we have already started with it. 
  [Abu-Zayid] With respect to the crossings question, will it 
be raised during the 'Arafat-Peres meeting this week? 
  ['Asfur] It is the right of the Palestinian people's 
leadership and the Israeli Government to discuss any issue. 
  [Abu-Zayid] But we have noticed that you have reached a dead 
end with respect to the question of border crossings? 
  ['Asfur] Had we arrived at a dead end, we would not have 
agreed to meet again. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Yes, but this question has taken enough time? 
  ['Asfur] It may take more time. We are not discussing time, 
but a solution. We know that these are difficult negotiations 
between two sides that have fought each other for a long time. 
Reaching a solution is not as easy as some believe. 
  [Abu-Zayid] How important is the paper that you drafted 
today 
for the essence of the negotiations on the crossings? 
  ['Asfur] The paper has set a general perspective about all 
the issues that we should discuss. So, we will not have to 
exchange papers again or to present a detailed paper by each 
side. We have drafted a paper which specifies all the issues 
that we must discuss. [end recording] 
  The Civilian Affairs Committee, which is headed by Attorney 
Jamil al-Tarifi for the Palestinians and Brigadier General Gadi 
Zohar for the Israelis, discussed the electricity issue. Also, 
the committee raised the question of launching a Palestinian 
television and radio for the first time. We have learned that 
tangible progress was achieved during today's session of the 
Civilian Affairs Committee. Attorney Jamil al-Tarifi said: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Tarifi] We have completed discussions 
on the registration of residents and documents. Up to this 
moment, Palestinian and Israeli experts are continuing 
discussions on the question of electricity. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Is there progress on the discussions of the 
Civilian Affairs Committee? 
  [Al-Tarifi] We expect so, God willing. 
  [Abu-Zayid] What about the question of the Palestinian radio 
and television? 
  [Al-Tarifi] Our experts have not arrived yet. We are 
expecting their arrival from Cairo. If they do not arrive 
today, we will hold this issue until next week, God willing. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Will the committee hold another session today? 
  [Al-Tarifi] God willing. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Is there progress on the Security Committee. 
  [Al-Tarifi] God willing. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Attorney Jamil al-Tarifi, is there a linkage 
between the talks of the Civilian Affairs and Security 
Committees. 
  [Al-Tarifi] In the final analysis, everything is linked to 
everything else. This is because there can be no comprehensive 
agreement by the Civilian Affairs Committee without an agreement 
on security issues. This is so there will only be one agreement. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Has a specified formula been reached on the 
issues that have been agreed upon? 
  [Al-Tarifi] Yes, a specified formula has been reached 
between 
us and the Israelis on the transfer of all the powers that have 
been agreed upon. [end recording] 
  Brigadier General Gadi Zohar, head of the Israeli team at 
the 
committee said that there is progress on this committee. He 
said: 
  [Begin recording] [Zohar] During this round of talks, we 
discussed a host of civilian issues, including electricity, 
which we are discussing today, passports, identification cards, 
etcetera. Contrary to our wishes, there is no speedy progress. 
There is still a lot to be done. This takes time. 
  [Abu-Zayid] When will you finish all issues pertaining to 
the 
Civilian Affairs Committee? 
  [Zohar] Who knows? When we reach an agreement, we know that 
we have finished our mission. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the Taba talks, by Hasan Abu-Zayid in Taba on 20 
January, from the "With the Midday Events" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-Zayid] How do you evaluate today's round of 
talks? 
  [Sha'th] I think that progress was made today and yesterday. 
I cannot say it is progress in substance, but in method. 
Progress in method sometimes opens the door for progress in 
substance. We always began from the starting point. When we 
resume talks, we also begin from the starting point. Therefore, 
the talks were haunted by a ghost called the crossings problem. 
Today, I think we agreed on the exact points of agreement and 
disagreement in the problem of the crossings so that we will not 
again start from zero when talks begin, whether in Taba or on a 
higher level when the leaders or foreign ministers meet. This, 
in my opinion, is the basic progress made. This progress is 
represented in the two sides' readiness to agree to the points 
of agreement and disagreement so that we will not start afresh 
when we discuss the issue of the crossings once again. We might 
later say the problem is not one of crossings, but of the points 
that are still controversial. Progress also continued vis-a-vis 
the issue of civil administration. I think that except for the 
Paris negotiations, which will determine the method of 
transferring power in economic issues, only the water problem 
remains. I do not want to downplay the importance of the water 
problem; it is a difficult problem in the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
It is difficult for the Palestinians, especially in Gaza. It 
is the only remaining problem and needs to be solved. All the 
rest deals with the method. Hence, we can really say that by 
the end of tomorrow nothing will practically remain except the 
issue of water. 
  [Abu-Zayid] If no agreement is reached in Taba, will the 
issue of border crossings be discussed in Oslo or elsewhere? 
  [Sha'th] I do not know what will exactly be discussed in 
Oslo. What is certain is that these negotiations are continuing. 
If Oslo presents an opportunity to solve some problems, we will 
naturally seize that opportunity. Nevertheless, these 
negotiations are continuing. Next Monday, delegations of the 
Security and Civilian Affairs Committees will meet as usual. 
  [Abu-Zayid] What do you expect from the Peres-'Arafat Oslo 
meeting this week? 
  [Sha'th] The meeting is basically Arab, that is, the aim of 
going to Oslo is to pay tribute to late Norwegian Minister 
Holst. We--President 'Arafat and I--are going there to take part 
in his funeral. Minister Peres is also going there to offer his 
condolences. But there will be an opportunity to meet. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Will that opportunity be enough to benefit from 
this meeting and reach an agreement? 
  [Sha'th] That might be possible. If this happens, I will 
undoubtedly be happy. The Norwegian ambassador here told me: 
Holst's soul will rejoice if you reach a peace agreement even 
during his funeral because he lived and died for peace. 
Consequently, Holst's soul will not be distressed if you seize 
the opportunity of his funeral to get closer to peace. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Will 'Arafat today ask for an Egyptian 
intervention to bring the Israeli-Palestinian views closer? 
  [Sha'th] The Egyptian intervention in the negotiations is 
always desirable by us and apparently by the Israeli side. 
There has been no objection to this constructive role by Egypt. 
Therefore, President 'Arafat's meeting with President Husni 
Mubarak will certainly be an important meeting during which 
President 'Arafat will fully brief President Mubarak on 
developments and ask for an Egyptian backing of the peace 
process. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Will the Palestinian side take part in the 
Washington talks and who will lead the Palestinian delegation? 
  [Sha'th] I do not know if anyone has been selected to lead 
the Palestinian delegation to Washington or at least to attend 
the meeting the heads of delegations will hold in Washington 
shortly. However, I think it might be Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat because 
he was deputy chairman of the previous delegation led by Dr. 
Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi. Consequently, it is logical to have him 
there, but this depends on President 'Arafat's decision.

  [Excerpts] Taba, Egypt, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Israel and the PLO 
agreed to disagree on Thursday [20 January] after another round 
of negotiations that failed to break the stalemate over who 
controls border crossings once Palestinian self-rule is 
launched. [passage omitted] 
  A senior aide to PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, who was in Cairo 
on Thursday, warned the peace process could run out of steam if 
there was no breakthrough within weeks. 
  "I believe we have a few weeks in front of us and if these 
problems are not resolved in weeks I think the whole Declaration 
of Principles and the process will be in danger," Yasir 
'Abdrabbuh told reporters in the capital. 
  "I don't think they have the luxury of time in order to wait 
for months. They need a quick solution as we do," he said, 
referring to Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres who said 
Wednesday that his country could afford to wait. 
  The chief PLO negotiator, Nabil Sha'th, said the Taba 
meetings had produced "some opening." Although a security deal 
is proving elusive, he has reported progress on the hand-over of 
civilian powers to the Palestinians. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] Egypt is trying to reduce the tension with 
Israel that has surfaced in the multilateral arms control talks. 
Nabil Fahmi, an aide to the Egyptian foreign minister and head 
of the Egyptian delegation to the arms control talks, yesterday 
visited Israel for a meeting with David 'Ivri, director general 
of the Defense Ministry and head of the Israeli delegation. 
  In this first-of-its-kind direct meeting between the Israeli 
and Egyptian representatives to the arms control talks, the 
sides were able to attain understandings that will prevent 
unnecessary bickering in the upcoming meeting in Cairo planned 
later this month between all the countries participating in the 
multilateral arms control talks. 
  The controversy between Egypt and Israel has centered on 
Egyptian diplomatic efforts to disarm Israel of its nuclear 
capacity and its demand to raise the nuclear issue in the 
multilateral talks as soon as possible. 
  Israel, on the other hand, demands to start the process by 
implementing confidence-building-measures between the region's 
countries, and to delay the nuclear issue until stable peace 
arrangements are implemented in the area. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The meetings of the follow-up ministerial 
committee of the second conference for information ministers of 
Islamic states began in Cairo today. The information ministers 
of Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia, and delegations 
representing Kuwait, the Sultanate of Oman, Palestine, Malaysia, 
Senegal, and the General Secretariat of the Islamic Conference 
Organization are taking part in these meetings. 
  Addressing the conference, Information Minister Muhammad 
Salman spoke about the importance of this meeting. He said: 
This meeting is aimed at following up the implementation of 
resolutions and recommendations reached during the previous 
conference. It is being held during critical circumstances in 
light of major international developments. This requires us to 
increase our coordination and integrate our joint efforts to 
implement these resolutions and recommendations. This should 
guarantee more strength and effectiveness for our joint efforts 
in the media field in order to reinforce the prestige and role 
of the peoples of our Islamic states in the world community and 
assist them to achieve progress, growth, and freedom under a new 
international order that is not established at the expense of 
our Islamic peoples but based on the principle of equality, 
parity, dialogue, and positive and constructive interaction 
among peoples. This new international order should guarantee 
for our peoples the achievement of freedom and sovereignty on 
their territories and the realization of a just and 
comprehensive peace that returns the occupied Arab territories 
in Palestine, southern Lebanon, and the Golan to their owners. 
This peace should also secure the rights of the Arabs and 
Muslims to holy Jerusalem, the Muslims' first qiblah [the 
direction a Muslim faces while praying], as emphasized in the 
Cairo media declaration issued in the second conference held by 
the information ministers of Islamic states. 
  The information minister also called for further 
coordination 
among Islamic states in all media fields in order to enhance the 
effectiveness of the media in Islamic states by taking advantage 
of new technological developments to accentuate the image of 
Islam and Muslims in a manner that confirms the importance of 
Islam and its great role in emphasizing respect for the human 
being and his right to justice, peace, progress, and freedom. 
Dr. Muhammad Salman added: Syria has participated in this 
march of our Islamic states toward joint media action from the 
time it was first launched at the conference in Jeddah, out of 
its firm belief in the great role that could be played within 
this joint Islamic framework in serving the issues of our 
countries and lifting injustice and deceit. Syria believes that 
the rapid international changes require us to focus on practical 
solutions and realistic visions in order to serve our joint 
causes. We believe that this meeting and the resulting 
recommendations will be an additional and blessed step which we 
hope will further strengthen this joint media action aimed at 
serving our people's interests. 
  Dr. Muhammad Salman arrived in Cairo this afternoon to take 
part in the meetings of the follow-up ministerial committee of 
the second conference for information ministers of Islamic 
states which is scheduled to last two days. He was received at 
Cairo International Airport by Egyptian Information Minister 
Safwat al-Sharif, Syria's Ambassador in Cairo Dr. 'Isa Darwish, 
the two assistants of the Egyptian information minister, and a 
number of top Information Ministry officials. 
  Dr. Muhammad Salman responded to reporters' questions at the 
airport. He said he was happy to meet with Safwat al-Sharif, 
the information minister of sisterly Egypt, which is taking part 
in the meetings of the follow-up committee of the conference 
held by the information ministers of Islamic states. He said: 
During the committee's meetings, we will discuss the means to 
formulate recommendations that will help guide our future action 
in the media field. 
  Responding to a question on media cooperation between Syria 
and Egypt, the minister said: We are working together for the 
integration of the Syrian and Egyptian media in various arenas. 
He added: The Egyptian information minister and I are seeking 
to achieve a new qualitative move toward developing these 
relations in order to reaffirm political relations between the 
two countries and between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Husni 
Mubarak. 
  On the results of the Geneva summit, the information 
minister 
said: The summit was clear. Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill 
Clinton openly responded to all questions. It remains for the 
Israeli side to respond to the results of the summit. 
  Dr. Salman spoke about the role of the Syrian media after 
the 
Geneva summit and said: The media do not represent an 
independent policy, but embody the Syrian policy trends on 
various levels. He added: We are seeking to develop and 
promote the media up to the level of the policy drawn and led by 
President Hafiz al-Asad. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Many Army officers tendered their resignations to 
the commander in chief of the Armed Forces last week to protest 
the deteriorating military establishment. In their resignation 
letters, the officers said they rejected a new escalation of war 
in the south and a government plan to send a military expedition 
to the south comprising nationalist officers who are not 
affiliated with the National Islamic Front. The plan is seen as 
a government attempt to liquidate these officers in war. 
  The "Brothers" learned that the commander in chief has not 
yet replied to the resignations, both because the Army needs the 
officers' expertise and because there is no cash to pay the 
allowance to which they would be entitled.

  [Text] Khartoum, Jan. 20, IRNA -- Sudan's first deputy 
foreign minister, 'Umar Berido [name as received], here Thursday 
termed as baseless the smear campaign launched by the global 
arrogance both against Khartoum and Tehran to portray them as 
terorrists. 
  Interviewed by IRNA, Berido said that economic and political 
stability in Iran and Sudan prompted the global arrogance to 
make such accusations. He stressed that the global arrogance 
which attributed terorristic activities to Iran and Sudan has 
remained silent towards atrocities being committed against 
Muslims in Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Berido said that 
definitely the two countries will overcome the difficulties with 
the help of God. 
  Commenting on Tehran-Khartoum relations, the Sudanese 
official said bilateral ties enjoy special sigfnificance and are 
deep and friendly.

  [Excerpts] The gates of Saharan security centers in Algeria 
have been opened; some of the 780 Islamist prisoners in these 
security centers have been released. [passage omitted] 
  A reaction from Rabah Kebir, one of the leaders of the 
Islamic Salvation Front in exile: He says these measures are 
insufficient: 
  [Begin Kebir recording] I am very pleased about the release 
of some of our brothers who were imprisoned wrongly and without 
trial in concentration camps and who have been there for two 
years now. This is not enough, however, because thousands of 
our brothers are still in prison, such as our leaders, first of 
all. 
  As for the national dialogue conference, as far as we are 
concerned, the junta in power is not to be taken seriously. 
That is why this conference has no chance of success. It is 
only a propaganda ploy to gain time. Should they ever want a 
negotiable solution, all they have to do is to look at the one 
condition we set during our news conference on 17 August 1993. 
It is no use giving us little presents to cheer us up. We are 
not children. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri by </F>
Abel Coelho de Morais; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Coelho] A conference for 
national dialogue which is to determine Algeria's future is 
currently being prepared. Are you afraid that this initiative 
will lead to a dead end, in view of the intention not to attend 
that has already been expressed by various political forces? 
  [Dembri] Two important processes of reforms are unfolding in 
Algeria, one linked to the political transition and the other 
concerning the economic reforms. In the first case, we are 
trying without exceptions to secure an agreement on the 
transitional period, which should not exceed three years. The 
conference will take place 25-26 January, and the platform and 
the institutions will be determined at it. 
  When this aim has been achieved, the country will be 
administered until the holding of presidential and legislative 
elections within a maximum period of three years, which could, 
however, be brought forward. 
  With respect to the economic reform, this is aimed at 
achieving a market economy. The legal instruments for running 
the transition and undertaking the reforms of the central bank's 
regulations have already been created. Last, we are negotiating 
with the IMF our foreign debt and the structural adjustments in 
our economy, a process which should be completed by the end of 
the month. 
  [Coelho] But this strategy does not in itself exhaust the 
fundamentalists' demands... 
  [Dembri] We know that the security issue worries other 
countries, but I can say that the terrorist actions which have 
occurred in Algeria do not necessarily originate inside the 
country. They are connected with the international situation, 
and they stem from the deterioration of the economic situation 
in the Third World. 
  [Coelho] Are you not concerned about the absence of 
important political parties from the dialogue proposed by the 
government? 
  [Dembri] There have been organizations which decided to take 
part and which later backtracked, but we must not despair. 
Algeria needs everybody. Only two conditions are set: 
Renouncing violence and respect for the constituent elements of 
the national identity. 
  [Coelho] "Without exception" includes organizations or 
figures linked to the fundamentalists... 
  [Dembri] The fundamentalists were not considered in 
particular. Everybody is accepted, provided that they accept 
the criteria which I mentioned. 
  [Coelho] Is the release of fundamentalist militants over the 
past few days a signal to the Islamic Salvation Front? 
  [Dembri] The invitations to the conference were made on the 
basis of openness. In this context, the measures adopted by the 
authorities reflect their idea of the normal running of the 
state and society... 
  [Coelho] Following the conference and with the winding up of 
the High State Committee, what kind of solution will be adopted 
during the transitional period which you propose? 
  [Dembri] There will be a presidential council, a government, 
and a transitional council comprising 180 people, which will 
function as a parliament, overseeing the government's activity. 
  [Coelho] And who will form the government? 
  [Dembri] According to the constitutional rules, the head of 
government, but, in view of the nature of the transitional 
period, it is clear that the choices will be made on the basis 
of openness. 
  [Coelho] You mentioned agreements which are about to be 
signed with the IMF. What are Algeria's economic priorities? To 
accelerate the reforms? 
  [Dembri] First, the debt must be treated in a way which will 
enable us to achieve a market economy without major social 
tensions. We hope that the IMF will not apply too strong a 
remedy for our economic system. We have an industrial system 
which we must set on its feet again, agriculture also needs 
major investments, and it is necessary to create jobs and boost 
public works. We hope that the negotiation with the IMF and the 
World Bank will not impose on us excessively tough structural 
adjustment measures: "constraints," as they are called in the 
IMF's language. 
  [Coelho] Within the framework of Algeria's strategy of a 
stronger link and cooperation with Europe, how would you define 
your country's relations with the European Union [EU] right now? 
  [Dembri] The EU holds the first place in our foreign trade. 
We wish to strengthen that cooperation through an agreement 
whose long-term aim will be the creation of a free trade area 
covering the Twelve and Algeria. Two lines of cooperation have 
already been defined by the EU -- one in the direction of the 
former USSR, the other aimed at the southern flank, the 
Mediterranean, and the Maghreb countries. 
  [Coelho] The dialogue between Europe and the Maghreb within 
the framework of the Five Plus Five group is deadlocked. Is it 
feasible to surmount the deadlock, or must alternative ways be 
sought in order not to lose this stage of cooperation between 
the two sides of the Mediterranean? 
  [Dembri] The dialogue within the framework of the Five Plus 
Five group is deadlocked owing to one problem -- the Lockerbie 
case. There is explicit opposition on the part of certain 
European countries to any Five Plus Five group meeting attended 
by the Maghreb country targeted over this affair (Libya). On 
the other hand, the nature of the Mediterranean area's problems 
requires constant consultation. So what is to be done? Either 
we move toward bilateral consultation processes or we must find 
a formula which will enable us to continue to meet. It is at 
this point that we find ourselves. 
  [Coelho] Algeria is following the Israeli-Arab dialogue as 
an interested party. What do you expect of the agreement 
between Tel Aviv and the PLO? What kind of relationship is 
beginning between Israel and the Arabs? 
  [Dembri] The agreement on Jericho and Gaza must develop 
favorably as a first step toward an overall solution to the 
Middle East problem. There must also be appropriate treatment 
of everything concerning the Palestinian problem, the 
establishment of a sovereign Palestinian entity, and the 
resolution of other regional problems, including Syria's 
relations with Israel and Lebanon's relations with Israel. 
  But this is not the only international problem that worries 
us. There is another.... 
  [Coelho] Which? 
  [Dembri] Bosnia, which is suffering terribly. Hence we want 
Europe and the international community to pledge to end this 
tragedy, the aggression against Bosnia's Muslims to cease, and 
the Bosnian unitary state to be safeguarded within the borders 
recognized by the international community.... 
  [Coelho] How? 
  [Dembri] It must not be forgotten that Bosnia became a UN 
member following a referendum held in the country at the 
international community's request. There are decisions by the 
international community which must be respected, but we should 
not forget that the embargo on Bosnia now mainly harms the 
Bosnians -- not their Serbian aggressors.

  [Text] Algiers -- A high-level Algerian source has 
revealed to AL-HAYAH that during his recent European tour 
Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri read details of a report 
aimed at removing Major General Khaled Nezzar. The source 
stated that "a general known for his hard-line position toward 
Islamists and his hostility to the Arab, Islamic line is in 
charge of the plan." The source stated that this general "has 
great influence inside the military and enjoys Maj. Gen. 
Nezzar's confidence." 
  The source added: "According to the report, the general in 
question (he declined to reveal his name) assigned a group of 
retired colonels in the military security organ to conduct a 
secret investigation to identify the quarters behind the bombing 
operations not attributed to Islamic groups. The results of the 
investigation revealed Maj. Gen. Nezzar's responsibility for 
them, including the attempt on his life and the attempt on the 
life of Gen. Toufik, chief of the military security organ." 
  The source stated that a European official "put Dembri in 
the 
picture with regard to the report, telling him that the general 
himself convinced his colleagues and a number of colonels that 
Nezzar is responsible for what has happened to the country and 
for the losses inflicted on the military and that his insistence 
on the method of holding a dialogue with the fundamentalists 
will eventually lead to handing over power to the Islamic 
Salvation Front." The source added that the European official 
stressed to Dembri "the existence of a petition signed by senior 
officers, urging Nezzar's removal in preparation for a coup to 
be led by the military's hard-line general." The report 
indicates that Nezzar's adversaries accuse him of monopolization 
and have detected "several secret contacts" he made with 
Salvation Front leaders via various channels, "including 
assigning Mohamed Cherif Messaadia, former secretary general of 
the National Liberation Front, to make contacts with the 
Islamists. He was seen frequenting a villa in the Draria area, 
west of the capital." The report stresses that Messaadia "was 
the target of an assassination or abduction attempt but the 
security services foiled it."

  [Text] Riyadh (DPA) -- German Economics Minister Guenter 
Rexrodt is positive that trade with Saudi Arabia can be expanded 
and that mutual investment can be extended. It is in the 
interest of both sides to reactivate their trade, which dropped 
by just over 20 percent in the first half of 1993, Rexrodt said 
in Riyadh today at the end of his two-day working visit. He was 
accompanied by 35 representatives of German industry. Primarily 
Saudi Arabia wants to export more oil and petrochemical products. 
  Rexrodt sees great opportunities for expanding economic 
relations in joint ventures. So far there are only 70 joint 
ventures, mainly in the area of sales. However, there is German 
business interest in many areas, especially telecommunications, 
the sale of Airbus aircraft, ship building, power stations, sea 
water desalination plants, cement works and petrochemistry. 
Details of specific projects were not discussed. 
  In order to encourage investment Rexrodt thinks it necessary 
to improve conditions for this. An agreement on investment 
protection, due to be concluded in May, will make a considerable 
contribution to this. It will be the first investment 
protection agreement between Saudi Arabia and another country. 
The availability of information about the Saudi legal system 
should also be improved. 
  In connection with concern expressed by German businesses 
about the deterioration in Saudi payment morale, the German 
economics minister said he had raised this issue in his talks 
with the Saudi ministers for finance and economy, defense and 
aviation, industry, oil and trade. 
  Another issue discussed at the talks was the planned 
European 
Union energy tax, Rexrodt said. Like other oil-producing 
countries, Saudi Arabia fears that this may cause a decrease in 
oil imports. Rexrodt stressed that demand would not be reduced 
by a higher mineral oil tax or higher energy taxes. He also 
pointed out that a CO2 energy tax would subject German coal to a 
much greater burden than oil. In 1992, German exports to Saudi 
Arabia reached a value of 4.2 billion German marks [DM], while 
imports from Saudi Arabia, mainly of crude oil, reached DM 2 
billion.

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, 19 Jan -- German Economic Affairs 
Minister Dr Guenther Rexrodt has said that during his visit to 
the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia he had the honor of meeting the 
custodian of the two holy mosques, King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz 
Al Sa'ud. [passage omitted] 
  In an opening statement at a news conference held today at 
the Palace of Conferences in Riyadh, he said that the aim of his 
visit to the Kingdom is to strengthen relations between the two 
countries, particularly in the economic sphere, by expanding 
trade and encouraging two-way investment. He stressed that 
Germany is considered as one of the Kingdom's trade partners, 
pointing out that the Kingdom has expressed a desire to alter 
the balance of trade with Germany by expanding its exports to 
Germany and setting up more joint companies. 
  He said: We believe that it would be possible to increase 
the number of joint companies by providing different and more 
facilities than the existing ones. 
  The German economics minister said that he had discussions 
with Minister of Finance and National Economy Muhammad 
Aba-al-Khayl on numerous issues of interest to the two countries. 
  He stressed that an atmosphere of complete frankness 
prevailed at his talks with officials in the Kingdom, and added 
that there is a feeling of deep and sincere friendship between 
the two sides which would serve the relations of cooperation 
between them, which he described as having reached a very good 
level. 
  In his replies to journalists, the German economics minister 
expressed his great admiration for the investments made in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He said in this respect: "I have seen 
a country with an abundance of investments which follows a wise 
policy and which has huge natural resources that it endeavors to 
preserve and expand." 
  He described the relations between the Kingdom and Germany 
as 
close and marked by mutual trust and respect, and said that the 
Kingdom is a country which values traditional relations. He 
added: We are very pleased that Germany is among the most active 
commercial and economic friends of this country. 
  Asked if agreements were signed during his visit to the 
Kingdom, his excellency said that no agreement was signed during 
the visit. He added: "The two countries believe in a free market 
economy and this is why we have left the commercial issues to be 
tackled by companies in the two countries." 
  He also expressed his thanks to the Saudi officials for 
their 
tireless efforts to remove the obstacles hindering trade between 
the two countries. The German minister then mentioned the 
forthcoming meeting of the joint Saudi-German committee due to 
be held in Germany in the next few months. 
  In reply to a question on trade exchanges between the Gulf 
Cooperation Council member-states and the European Community, 
the minister indicated that both sides are very interested in 
reaching an agreement on free trade. He added that Germany is 
prepared to play a role in this respect out of its belief in 
free world trade. 
  Regarding Germany's stand on the imposition of a carbon tax 
on energy, Dr Rexrodt said: "No early decision will be taken on 
the matter, and there is no scope at the moment for the 
imposition of such a tax." 
  In reply to a question on the purchase by the Kingdom of 
civilian aircraft to modernize the fleet of Saudi Airlines and 
on possible German participation in this, the German economics 
minister said: We know that the Kingdom is thinking of renewing 
its fleet and every large company capable of delivering the 
required equipment is trying to enter the competition in the 
Kingdom. We are interested in the participation of our large 
companies in the renewal of the fleet of Saudi aircraft.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the General Committee of the General </F>
People's Congress; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. In light of the atmosphere of hope and optimism 
which has begun to prevail in the country, the General Committee 
of the General People's Congress [GPC] would like to extend its 
warmest congratulations to the lofty Yemeni masses on the 
occasion of the signing, in heroic Aden today, of a document of 
pledge and accord to build a modern Yemeni state by parties to 
the Political Forces Dialogue. 
  The GPC considers this step a crowning of the sincere 
national efforts to put a decisive end to the political crisis 
and its regrettable repercussions, which have negatively 
reflected on the lives of the citizens and harmed the homeland's 
interests and stability. 
  Hence, the GPC's General Committee welcomes the positive 
results that have been achieved and stresses its adherence to 
the contents of the Document of Pledge and Accord. It, along 
with all the forces of goodwill in the country, hopes that this 
approved national step will be the beginning of a translation 
and achievement of all the aspirations of our people. These 
aspirations include maintaining the unity of the homeland and 
reinforcing the pluralistic democratic experiment; building the 
modern Yemeni state--the state of law and order--as well as the 
constitutional institutions founded on justice, democracy, and 
respect for human rights; entrenching the bases of local 
government which are based on administrative and financial 
decentralization; seeking to alleviate the suffering of the 
citizens and securing their daily life requirements; and 
achieving a cultural awakening in modern Yemen. 
  Moreover, the GPC also expresses its deep appreciation for 
the Political Forces Dialogue Committee for its extensive 
efforts and the formidable difficulties it faced to achieve this 
document, which is an obligating pledge or (?contract) for 
everyone. It is a document that should be adhered to and put 
into practice by everyone to shoulder his responsibility to 
achieve what is contained in this document as far as 
implementation mechanisms and timetables are concerned. 
  The GPC continues to be loyal to Yemen and its people and is 
concerned about unity, democracy, and national accord. It has 
been guided by wisdom and patience in order to remove all the 
dangers and challenges facing this homeland. Moreover, 
throughout the crisis, the GPC's stands have been marked by 
national responsibility, good sense, and self-restraint. It 
strongly refused to be drawn into the perils of escalation which 
harms the homeland and its unity, the democratic formula, and 
the citizens' interests. Hence, the GPC announces that it will 
not hesitate to exert every effort and join hands with all those 
who are concerned about Yemen--the Yemen of unity and 
democracy--in order to triumph for the issues of the homeland 
and the people, to practically implement all agreements, and to 
move our homeland toward a better and prosperous future in 
fulfillment of all our people's aspirations and ambitions of 
progress, growth, and prosperity under the banner of unity, 
democracy, and peace. 
  Issued by the GPC's General Committee.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, Jan 19 (AFP)--A key player in the 
Yemeni crisis on Wednesday cast a shadow over a peace accord to 
settle the country's political dispute, saying he demanded 
guarantees for his security before signing it. 
  Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner and leader of 
the Yemen Socialist Party (YSP), said he was satisfied with the 
agreement reached Tuesday but said he wanted to be briefed on 
security arrangements for the signing ceremony before committing 
himself. 
  Al-Bid has since August been embroiled in a dispute over the 
running of the country with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a 
northerner and head of the ruling General People's Congress 
(GPC). 
  The agreement on a range of reforms reached by 
representatives of Yemen's major political forces, notably the 
YSP and GPC, specifies in Article 7 that a committee be created 
to "establish security conditions required for the signature of 
the accord," by Salih and al-Bid. 
  "The committee must first present the required program for 
implementation of Article 7 and then we'll offer our point of 
view," al-Bid told AFP. 
  More than 150 YSP officials have been killed in attacks 
since 
North and South Yemen merged in May 1990. Al-Bid's party has 
blamed several of the attacks on the Islamic Jihad organization 
which it says is protected by the northern Al-Islah Islamic 
party. 
  A GPC spokesman meanwhile said Salih had unconditionally 
accepted the agreement "and is ready to sign, on the date and at 
the time specified, the accord he considers a good step emerging 
from the current crisis and that he is ready to translate it 
into action." 
  The GPC's political bureau voiced the party's commitment to 
compliance with all the accord's clauses, notably those on 
security arrangements and administrative decentralization. 
  Al-Bid, the president of the former south, left the capital 
for his home in Aden on August 19, demanding political and 
economic reforms. Earlier this month he refused to attend a 
reconciliation meeting with Salih. 
  The vice president's comments Wednesday were in reply to a 
statement by Hammud Hashim al-Dharahi, a representative of the 
Islamic Al-Islah party and a member of the security committee, 
who told AFP that al-Bid was "prepared to accept the date and 
place proposed by the committee for the signing of the accord." 
  The accord was drawn up during two months of tough 
negotiations and calls for the withdrawal within one week of 
forces deployed along the former border between North and South 
Yemen. 
  The cabinet, meeting Wednesday in Sanaa under First Deputy 
Prime Minister Hasan Muhammad Makki, voiced satisfaction with 
the accord. 
  Announcement of the agreement came only hours after the GPC 
charged that a southern Yemeni warplane had bombed a northern 
army brigade. GPC and YSP officials had accused each other of 
massing troops along the former border.

<F P=106> [From Salih al-Qallab in Aden] </F>
  [Excerpts] Now that an agreement has been initialed among 
the political forces in Yemen, the Yemeni crisis, which has been 
going on since August and which has recently reached the point 
of armed confrontation, has taken a wide step toward 
reconciliation. However, it cannot be said that everything is 
definitively over and that the clouds have rolled by, never to 
return unless this agreement is implemented in accordance with a 
definite timeframe. 
  A good reading of this agreement will show that the Yemeni 
unity, which began in May 1990, is heading toward a 
confederation This is clear from the agreement's emphasis on 
decentralizing the Yemeni republic's administration. In fact, 
this would in any case prove to be a thousand times better than 
a shaky merger liable to explode at any moment. In addition to 
the decentralized administration, the agreement stipulates 
redeployment of forces and removing military posts situated in 
and outside towns. 
  AL-DUSTUR has learned that efforts are now being made to 
prepare for a large ceremony so that Salih al-Bid can sign the 
agreement under King Husayn's patronage and in the presence of 
Omani Sultan Qabus and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. 
Other Arab officials may be invited to this signing ceremony in 
addition to the diplomatic corps. Obviously, the site of this 
celebration in which the president and his deputy will meet for 
the first time in five months, is still a controversial issue. 
[passage omitted] 
  A senior Yemeni source which participated in drafting the 
agreement, regarded now by the Yemenis as a new proclamation of 
unity, said that al-Bid, who has been residing in Aden since 
August, informed the dialogue committee that he was prepared to 
meet with the president in any place and at any time that the 
committee sees fit and that he has no reservations on anything 
that is based on the contents of the agreement. 
  While it is true that the agreement has ended the tension 
and 
imparted an atmosphere of relief represented by the drop in the 
dollar price from 75 to 50 Yemeni rials on the black market 
within hours of the announcement of the agreement, optimists put 
the rate of possible success in implementing the agreement at 
only 40 percent. [passage omitted] 
  It is well known that there are currently four armies of 
different sizes and diverging loyalties in Yemen. These are the 
Sanaa-based army which takes orders from President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, the Aden-based army which takes orders from 
'Ali Salim al- Bid, an army owing allegiance to 'Ali Nasir 
Muhammad, the former president of the former People's Democratic 
Republic of Yemen, and paramilitary militias which belong to the 
reform movement led by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. 
  Reliable information sources say that all the Yemeni groups 
which reached the agreement the day before yesterday have agreed 
to seek the assistance of Jordanian military expertise to 
reunite and rehabilitate the Yemeni Armed Forces. If all goes 
well, a Jordanian Army force will travel to Yemen within three 
weeks. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, met with [passage indistinct]. 
Addressing attendees, the brother chairman said: We should 
transcend trivialities and be as great as the homeland is. 
[words indistinct]. He said that the command of the general 
People's Congress has welcomed and supported the document that 
has been drafted by the National Dialogue Committee, and that it 
has blessed it in its entirety. He said: What is left to be 
done is to translate the document into action. Our brothers in 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], led by brother 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, cabinet members, and all YSP leaders should return to 
Sanaa, the political capital of unified Yemen to exercise their 
executive and constitutional tasks until the crisis ends 
forever. This is in response to the aspirations of our Yemeni 
people and to the national interest. 
  He urged the political forces and sons of the homeland to 
transcend trivialities [words indistinct] for the sake of the 
Yemen of 22 May 1990 and to help the dialogue committee 
implement its missions to enable the homeland to reach the 
shores of safety. He urged political forces to respond to the 
demands of the masses and to adopt their concerns and represent 
their aspirations and respect their will. He said that this is 
only possible when everyone renounces selfish interests and 
advocates the supreme interests of the Yemeni masses and 
homeland. 
  The brother president urged the executive authority and all 
workers in all governorates [words indistinct] and government 
institutions and facilities to give up passiveness and laxity, 
to work harder, and to stop attributing their passiveness to the 
political crisis. He also urged political forces and all sons 
of the homeland to support and advise their people to maintain 
security, stability, tranquility, and national unity. He 
blessed all the decisions and recommendations contained in the 
statements issued by the expanded popular gatherings in the 
capital and in the governorates of al-Bayda', Dhimar, Sa'dah and 
all governorates of the republic. He said: We bless those 
decisions which reflect a great national sense and strong 
eagerness to adhere to the national constants and to preserve 
the country's achievements, at the head of which are unity and 
democracy. He indicated that through unity, our people have 
turned over the leaf of agonies and tragedies, and that through 
unity, the status of the Yemeni people and Yemen has become 
greater in the eyes of the world. He said: Today, we should be 
stronger. We should not bend our heads before the wicked plots 
against unity, security, stability, and peace in our country. 
  The brother president praised the move undertaken by the 
sons 
of al-Bayda' Governorate to hold a general reconciliation among 
the sons of the governorate to end acts of revenge. He also 
praised their work to achieve security, stability, and the 
supremacy of the law. He called for such a reconciliation at 
the national level throughout Yemen to end acts of revenge and 
spare Yemeni blood. 
  A number of brothers also spoke on behalf of the expanded 
popular gatherings of the population of the capital and the 
governorates of al-Bayda', Dhimar, and Sa'dah. They expressed 
the people's happiness with and support for the document of 
pledge and accord that has been drafted by the National Dialogue 
Committee. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Political Studies Center report: "The Story of the </F>
Dispatch of Jordanian Disengagement Force to Yemen: Force 
Recalled While Airborne After Conversation Between King Husayn 
and al-Bid"] 
  [Excerpt] London -- Informed Arab sources have revealed 
details of the story of the dispatch of Jordanian disengagement 
forces to border areas between the two parts of Yemen to observe 
the withdrawal of the forces of Aden's Yemeni Socialist Party 
[YSP] and Sanaa's General People's Congress [GPC] from the 
borders and to prevent any clashes between them because of the 
tense situation there. 
  The sources said that the idea of sending Jordanian 
disengagement forces was conveyed to Amman by Yemeni Deputy 
Prime Minister Mujahid Abu-Shawarib when he visited the 
Jordanian capital a while back and held talks with King Husayn 
of Jordan on the latest developments in the Yemeni crisis. 
  The sources said they believed that King HUsayn understood 
from Abu-Shawarib that the idea of sending Jordanian forces to 
the border between the two parts of Yemen had the approval of 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, and that is why he ordered the relevant 
authorities in the Jordanian Army command to prepare these 
forces for immediate departure for specified areas in Yemen. 
  The force, consisting of a number of officers and warrant 
officers, boarded a military aircraft which took off for Sanaa 
but did not complete the journey, returning halfway through the 
flight after receiving orders to do so from the Jordanian 
command. 
  According to the sources, it seems that King Husayn, in a 
telephone conversation with 'Ali Salim al-Bid, discovered that 
the idea of sending Jordanian disengagement forces to the border 
areas was a "northern" idea only, and so he ordered the force to 
return to Amman. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Executive Committee member </F>
Mahmud 'Abbas in Tunis by Riyad Mansur -- date not given] 
  [Text] [Mansur] How did the PLO view the Geneva summit 
between the U.S. and Syrian presidents? 
  ['Abbas] We began the Arab-Israeli negotiations in Madrid 
together. We also moved together in Washington and in the 
multilateral talks. Tracks like the Palestinian or Jordanian 
tracks made more progress than other tracks. Now it is Syria's 
turn. We believe that achieving positive results in negotiations 
on the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks will lead to a 
comprehensive solution. Therefore, we consider it [the Geneva 
summit] a positive and good step toward solving the issue of the 
occupied Syrian territories. 
  [Mansur] Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' had earlier 
called for excluding the PLO from Arab coordination. Do you 
think the Clinton-al-Asad summit has invalidated this call? 
  ['Abbas] I do not want to comment on that, but four- or 
five-track coordination is necessary. Coordinated Arab 
positions and unity are essential. Consequently, I have no 
comment on Minister al-Shar's statement. What really concerns 
me is that the track has succeeded and this is something good 
for us. 
  [Mansur] How does the PLO view the Palestinian-Syrian 
relationship following the success of negotiations on the Syrian 
track? 
  ['Abbas] I think it must be good because both of us are 
moving in the same direction. The Palestinians might have been 
accused of moving faster or acting unilaterally, but now that 
progress has been made, I do not think talk about who advanced 
or lagged behind is valid any more. Now we all are supposed to 
think about the future and to have good relations with our 
brothers in Syria. 
  [Mansur] What can the Palestinian leadership tell the Syrian 
leadership now that progress has been made on the Syrian track? 
  ['Abbas] The PLO tells the Syrian leadership that what it 
did 
was good and we hope this process will continue and lead to full 
agreement based on complete withdrawal from the Golan and on 
full withdrawal for full peace. We hope the Syrian brothers 
will pursue this course until peace is attained. 
  [Mansur] Do you think differences between Syria and the PLO 
are over and bridges in Syrian-PLO relations can be 
reestablished? 
  ['Abbas] Bridges between us and Syria have not been broken; 
they might have been clouded, but not broken. 
  [Mansur] An economic agreement similar to the one signed 
with 
Jordan is expected to be signed with Egypt. Does this agreement 
conflict with the one signed with Jordan? 
  ['Abbas] Absolutely not. We do not accept any contradiction. 
It will complement the agreement with Jordan. We studied the 
Egyptian agreement very carefully so that there will be no 
contradiction or privileges for one at the expense of the other. 
  [Mansur] How far have you gone in studying this agreement? 
  ['Abbas] The Palestinian-Egyptian economic agreement is 
ready 
for signing. 
  [Mansur] The Palestinian-Israeli economic committee meetings 
in Paris have been postponed until further notice. Why? 
  ['Abbas] They have been postponed for a short period of time 
pending the results of the Taba talks. We will resume the Paris 
talks once the results of the Taba talks are known. 
  [Mansur] The U.S. secretary of commerce called on the Arab 
states to lift the Arab boycott of Israel. How do you view this 
call? 
  ['Abbas] We said more than once that the Arab boycott is 
linked to the Arab position. This is an Arab as well as a 
Palestinian position. Hence, any progress in this regard should 
be made within an Arab context. 
  [Mansur] Are your differences with President 'Arafat over? 
Have you settled your differences with him or not? 
  ['Abbas] There are no real differences between us; we are 
together in one leadership, one institution, one movement, and 
one organization. However, we, within the framework of this 
institution, may have differences in opinion. We discuss these 
opinions and may agree or disagree. This disagreement will not 
reach the stage of a split. Differences in opinion within the 
organization do exist. 
  [Mansur] It was reported that there are differences between 
the PLO and Jordan on Jerusalem. What is the truth behind these 
differences if indeed they exist? 
  ['Abbas] There are no differences whatsoever on Jerusalem. 
Jerusalem is a Palestinian Arab land. We, Jordan, and both the 
Arab and Islamic world demand its return. There are absolutely 
no differences with the brothers in Jordan over the issue of 
Jerusalem.

<F P=106> [Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulaybi report from Tunis, accompanied by </F>
other unattributed reports] 
  [Excerpts] Tunis, Cairo, Tehran (AL-SHARQ-AL-AWSAT and 
agencies) -- Fatah Central Committee Member Muhammad Ghunaym 
(Abu-Mahir) has denied that the Palestinians viewed with concern 
and anxiety the results of the summit meeting held between 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton 
in Geneva last Sunday [16 January]. He stressed that the PLO 
welcomed the results of that summit. 
  Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa called the summit 
"successful." [passage omitted] 
  In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Abu-Mahir 
said 
that all the rumors about Palestinian fear of that summit were 
personal views which did not reflect the PLO position. Contrary 
to what is being said, Abu-Mahir added, the PLO welcomes the 
al-Asad-Clinton summit results because they point to progress in 
the negotiations in general. President al-Asad's statement 
insisting on a comprehensive solution and on the implementation 
of Security Council resolutions 242, 338, and 425 indicates that 
Syria wants a comprehensive and just solution in the region, he 
said. 
  Abu-Mahir emphasized that progress on the Syrian track would 
serve all other tracks including the Palestinian track. 
[passage omitted] 
  Since the signing of the [Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of 
Principles] agreement, Syrian-Palestinian relations have been 
very cool, reaching a freezing point because Damascus did not 
approve of the agreement. 
  Despite statements by some Palestinian officials that the 
Palestinians welcome the summit results, the truth is quite 
different. The Palestinian leadership, combining PLO Executive 
Committee members and Fatah Central Committee members, has been 
in continuous session since last Saturday, that is, one day 
before the al-Asad-Clinton summit, but so far no official 
statement or explanation has been issued. [passage omitted] 
  According to highly placed Palestinian sources, the reason 
for the delay in announcing the Palestinian position on that 
summit is the ambiguity surrounding it, insofar as it was not 
perfectly clear if al-Asad sought to reactivate the negotiations 
to serve only Syria's interests or to serve all the tracks, 
particularly the Palestinian track, in harmony with Syria's 
pan-Arab line. 
  The sources added that the PLO fears that, after the summit, 
Syria might revive its attempts to contain the Palestinian 
element and the independent Palestinian decisionmaking which the 
PLO has over many years paid a high price to maintain. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] [Announcer] A former peace negotiator of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization calls for international 
pressure so that Israel will dismantle its settlements in the 
occupied territories. In the view of Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, 
who is visiting Finland, Israel is not displaying a true spirit 
of negotiation when it--at the same time--increases its 
settlements, continues military operations in Lebanon, and does 
not free political prisoners. The PLO and Israel are currently 
negotiating in Taba, Egypt about border control in the self-rule 
areas, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the borders of 
Jericho. These issues are important in themselves, but the PLO 
leadership knows that peace cannot be achieved if the settlement 
issue is not solved, 'Abd-al-Shafi says. 
  [Begin 'Abd-al-Shafi recording, in English] Now these are 
important, we concede they are important issues, and I certainly 
do not condone the position of Israel with respect to this. But 
all the same, we look at these issues as being irrelevant in the 
face of the ongoing settlement process and I think Chairman 
'Arafat is aware of it. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi resigned from the PLO's 
negotiation delegation in the summer after the secret 
negotiations in Oslo between Yasir 'Arafat and Israel became 
public. 'Abd-al-Shafi is paying an unofficial visit to Finland.

  [Text] At 1415 today, Zionist warplanes raided bases that 
belong to the Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] in the Bi'wirta region. The 
bases have been used for over a year as centers for social and 
medical services. 
  A spokesman for the PFLP-GC has made the following 
statement: 
At exactly 1415 today, a formation of Zionist warplanes raided 
al-Na'imah region targeting a dispensary that belongs to the 
PFLP-GC and firing several missiles. Two workers in the 
dispensary sustained various injuries. Also, the dispensary 
building, in addition to several cars and surrounding buildings, 
sustained material damage. One of the two workers was died from 
his injury. 
  Until the early hours of the evening, the Zionist enemy 
planes conducted reconnaissance missions over the region. Boat 
lights were also spotted off the al-Damur and al-Na'imah coasts. 
  The spokesman added that the PFLP-GC, which was targeted by 
Zionist shelling for the second time in two weeks, declares that 
these strikes will only increase its resolve and strengthen its 
refusal to make peace with or recognize the Zionist enemy. It 
will continue to support the popular intifadah in Palestine 
until the defeat of the treasonous Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The PFLP-GC reasserts that it will continue to adhere to 
armed struggle and jihad, in addition to national and Islamic 
resistance in southern Lebanon and Palestine, until the 
liberation of Palestine and all of the occupied Arab territories. 
  It is a revolution until the liberation of man and land.

  [Text] [Paris] Radio Monte Carlo has reported that Ahmad 
Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], has accused 
the U.S. Administration of deception, disinformation, and 
hypocrisy in its attempts to cause dissension among the allies 
opposing the Palestinian limited self-rule agreement. Jibril, 
who was speaking to AFP, continued: The objective that 
Washington sought to achieve through the Geneva summit was to 
neutralize the Syrian position so it could impose the 
Gaza-Jericho First agreement. However, the strength and 
firmness of the President al-Asad's position has foiled this 
objective. President al-Asad stood in defense of the Arab 
nation's causes and refuted all allegations. In Geneva, 
President al-Asad was as we have always known him -- an Arab 
knight faithful to the Arab nation's rights.

  [Text] Ahmad Jibril, secretary general of the Popular Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine--General Command has said that 
at the [U.S.-Syrian] Geneva summit, the United States tried to 
neutralize the Syrian stand in order to impose the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement and strike at the alliance opposed to the short-term 
agreement between the PLO and Israel. 
  Dr. George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front 
for 
the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], believes that the Geneva 
summit results will not have a negative effect on the existing 
alliance between Syria and the Alliance of Palestinian Forces 
[APF] which is opposed to the Israeli Palestinian agreement. 
  Habash's stand was revealed in an answer to a question by 
Salim Badawi related to the possible effect of the Syrian-U.S. 
summit on the opposition methods adopted by the PFLP: 
  [Begin Habash recording] I do not think so. This is because 
our struggle in the PFLP, and this also applies to Hamas, is 
based on struggle inside the occupied territories. Concerning 
this issue, Syria is still strongly supporting the intifadah. 
Therefore, I do not believe that we are facing a great 
diversion between the APF and Syria. Moreover, we must consider 
that despite the Geneva summit, Syria continues to demand the 
implementation of all UN resolutions, not only with respect to 
the Golan but also with respect to Lebanon, and the occupied 
territories, including Jerusalem. This means that this issue 
will be a long drawn out one, especially since we must take into 
consideration the intransigent Israeli attitude. 
  What was Israel's attitude throughout the summit and in its 
aftermath? Israel's answer was to hold a referendum. I see this 
as a kind of escape from the process on the Israeli track. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [By 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>
  [Excerpts] Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman of the 
Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has stated that the first 
meeting of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces [APF], which was 
formed in the Syrian capital on 5 January, will meet in Damascus 
today. In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, Ghawshah said that 
the alliance's 20-member leadership (two members from each 
faction) will discuss the results of the Syrian-U.S. summit and 
its implications for the Palestinian people's cause at this 
important and serious stage. [passage omitted] 
  Answering a question, Ghawshah described the Syrian-U.S. 
summit in Geneva as "an important political meeting but we do 
not expect quick or direct results from it. The first result 
could be an improvement in Syrian-U.S. relations." [quotation 
marks as published] Any developments in the Middle East problem, 
will be premature for the following reasons among others: 
  1. The Syrian track is a major track with many obstacles. 
The U.S. Administration, represented by Clinton, does not hold 
sway over the Zionist entity. There are two major power centers 
for this entity: one inside the Zionist entity itself and the 
other in the United States, represented by the Zionist lobby. 
  2. The ball of fire has moved quickly to the Zionist side. 
The Zionist Knesset is in permanent session and the settlers 
and rightists, especially the Likud and religious parties, have 
made quick moves against withdrawal from the Golan, forcing 
Rabin to announce through his deputy Mordekhay Gur that he is 
prepared to hold a referendum on full withdrawal from the Golan. 
This in itself will create other contradictions. Some are 
demanding fresh Jewish elections. All this indicates that any 
hopes that caused some to be optimistic will collapse. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Nabi 'Abd-al-Sattar] </F>
  [Text] Libyan President [title as published] Mu'ammar al- 
Qadhdhafi has asked for an urgent summit meeting with President 
Husni Mubarak to end the current coolness in Egyptian-Libyan 
relations which followed the disappearance in Cairo of the 
Libyan opposition figure Mansur al-Kikhya. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi has sent a personal message to President 
Mubarak, informing him of Libya's commitment not to touch Libyan 
opposition figures who reside in or have been granted asylum in 
Egypt. 
  Libya has informed Cairo that it was not involved in 
al-Kikhya's disappearance on 10 December 1993 either directly or 
indirectly. Libyan Embassy sources noted that the investigations 
carried out by Egyptian security agencies have not pointed a 
finger at anyone. 
  Egyptian Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi 
submitted a report to President Mubarak about the circumstances 
surrounding al-Kikhya's disappearance.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 19 Jan (MENA)--An official source at the 
Ministry of Interior has stated that the sweeps carried out by 
the security forces in southern Cairo early this morning 
resulted in the wounding of terrorist Muhammad Ahmad Farhan, a 
fugitive sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor in the 
Zinhum incident and sentenced to 15 years in another case for 
possessing explosives. 
  The source added that the wounded terrorist was involved in 
the attack against the Majdah movie theater in Hulwan, as well 
as the recent attack against a tourist bus in Misr al-Qadimah. 
  The terrorist was caught in possession of an automatic 
rifle, 
a large amount of ammunition, and $5,000. 
  Another terrorist was apprehended in the sweeps. Samir 
Isma'il Salih, a Palestinian national studying at the al-Azhar 
Institute in Hiliyat al-Zaytun, is one of the very dangerous 
elements trained in using weapons. He took part in the attack 
against a tourist bus in Misr al-Qadimah. [passage omitted] 
  Sayyid 'Abd-al-Fattah of the Special Forces was martyred in 
the incident while NCO Khalid 'Adli Musa of the Cairo

<F P=106> [Report by Hamid al-Alfi from al-'Arish] </F>
  [Text] As part of their campaign to seize weapons and 
explosives and arrest terrorists, the north Sinai intelligence 
agencies have seized 20 weapons -- including a mortar gun, an 
antiaircraft gun, 26 kg of dynamite, 25 hand grenades, and 35 
dynamite sticks -- along with their owners. The search 
campaign, which was conducted on instructions from Interior 
Minister Hasan al- Alfi, is intended to confront all terrorists 
and criminals. The campaign was supervised by Major General 
Sami Katat, assistant to the interior minister for north Sinai 
security, and led by Brigadier General Muhammad Abu-Shu'ayshi', 
director of the Intelligence Department. Colonels Hilmi 
al-Shanhabi, Budayr al-Qasir, and Ahmad Antus took part in the 
campaign. 
  In addition to the weapons, the campaign uncovered nine 
cases 
of robberies, 130 cases of car smuggling, three cases of drug 
trafficking and cultivating, eight cases of financial fraud, and 
five cases of forgery of foreign currencies. In addition, 182 
suspects were arrested and referred to the State Security 
Intelligence Department. The campaign uncovered 42 cases of 
alcohol smuggling and prostitution, 1,106 cases of evasion of 
verdicts, 25 cases of illegal supplies, 1,193 traffic tickets, 
and 89 other cases. The defendants have been referred to the 
Public Prosecution Office, which has started interrogations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi by Nabil </F>
Zaki; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Zaki] The government has repeatedly affirmed 
that terrorism has been eliminated and terrorists have been 
liquidated, but citizens were surprised by a serious escalation 
of terrorist operations, including an attempt to assassinate the 
prime minister. Do the security agencies have enough information 
on the terrorist networks, I mean information that indicates the 
actual magnitude of the problem? 
  [Al-Alfi] Currently they are concentrating on gathering the 
information. I can affirm that gathering and analyzing 
information is not limited to just inside Egypt but has expanded 
to include information on terrorist activities abroad. There is 
coordination among all police agencies in this regard. 
  As for statements on eliminating terrorism, I do not imagine 
we will eradicate and uproot the crime for good because crime 
has existed since man was created, since Cain and Abel. 
[passage omitted] 
  We must be prepared to confront violence and terrorism. The 
reason behind the latest escalation is that the terrorist groups 
target not only Egypt but also all the Arab and Islamic 
countries. It has been noticed that the extremists and deviants 
have nothing to do with religion; they use religion as a pretext 
and use people with confused thinking in return for money. This 
was evident during investigations into recent cases. Besides, 
we do not wait for a terrorist act to happen and then react. 
  [Zaki] Does this mean that the initiative is now in the 
hands 
of security agencies? 
  [Al-Alfi] We no longer wait for a terrorist act to happen 
and 
then react. The initiative is now in our hands. Information is 
bound to flow to the security authorities now that the means of 
obtaining such information have been modernized. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Zaki] Don't you agree that there is slackness on the part 
of 
the security officials in protecting a public opposition figure, 
such as former Libyan minister Mansur al-Kikhya? 
  [Al-Alfi] First, Mansur al-Kikhya is a refugee in another 
country and not in Egypt. He did not take refuge in Egypt. We 
protect the refugees we have. As for al-Kikhya, he holds 
several nationalities and came to Egypt on an Algerian passport 
to participate in a conference of the Arab Human Rights 
Organization in Cairo. After the conference ended, he stayed on 
in the Safir Hotel without informing the authorities concerned. 
  [Zaki] Didn't he tell anyone? 
  [Al-Alfi] He came to participate in a conference of the Arab 
Human Rights Organization. He did not come as a refugee. We 
carried out our task to provide full security for the conference 
and nothing happened during the conference sessions. Al-Kikhya 
went to Alexandria for two days during the first week after the 
conference ended and returned to Cairo. During this time, some 
people contacted him asking to meet him and from then on he 
acted on his own. Intense security investigations are under way 
to learn about his movements during the week following the 
conference. To be precise, we must say that al-Kikhya did not 
come to us as a refugee but to attend a conference whose 
sessions were provided with full security. Investigations are 
continuing into those persons who met him last and into his 
movements and the places he frequented. 
  [Zaki] When Major General Hasan al-Alfi took responsibility 
for the Ministry of Interior, many people, including me, 
expected that this would put an end to any torture inside 
prisons and detention centers in Egypt. It was noticed that the 
government agreed to host the conference of the Arab Human 
Rights Organization in Cairo for the first time, which is a 
great development. Mr. Minister, is the talk about torture 
still existing in Egypt true? 
  [Al-Alfi] If there are excesses, they must be individual 
cases and not a common state practice. If such individual 
excesses have occurred, the perpetrators were questioned and 
some were actually put on trial. Judicial sentences were also 
passed against some and others were acquitted. Those who were 
sentenced are still serving their terms and some of them stood 
trial before a disciplinary court that punished them. These are 
individual acts and not part of the practices of the state, 
government, or the agency. 
  [Zaki] Is that not policy? 
  [Al-Alfi] Of course not. The recent persistent talk on this 
issue falls within the context of collusion between those who 
perpetrate acts of violence and terrorism and their defenders to 
confuse the situation and frustrate those who pursue and arrest 
the terrorists. Their aim is also to tarnish the image of 
police to delay them and limit their action. [passage omitted] 
  [Zaki] It is said that a large number of convicted people 
are 
at large. 
  [Al-Alfi] We have established a new department for this 
purpose. I believe that the police and judiciary's efforts are 
worthless if sentences against wrongdoers and convicts are not 
implemented. Hence, I set up a specialized department to 
implement the sentences, coordinate with courts, and follow up 
on sentences. Its task is also to coordinate with all the 
authorities that have fugitive convicts and suspects in pending 
court cases. It is a strong agency that has been provided with 
all facilities to arrest suspects and convicted fugitives, and 
we have achieved good results. [passage omitted]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Cairo AL-SHA'B in Arabic in its issues 
of 11 and 14 January carries several articles highlighting an 
apparent dispute between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Labor 
Party in connection with a recent call by the government for a 
dialogue with the opposition and the opposition's response to it. 
  In a 1,500-word article on page 5 of the 11 January edition, 
Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi notes that the 
Brotherhood welcomes the call for national dialogue and refers 
to the consensus among political parties and other political 
forces that "political reform is the true introduction to any 
earnest reformation of our dear country's affairs." 
  He expresses astonishment at published statements saying 
that 
the dialogue will be restricted to five political parties the 
representatives of which will talk with the National Democratic 
Party's [NDP] representatives and that some political forces, 
notably the Muslim Brotherhood, have been excluded, at least 
from the initial stages of the dialogue. 
  He asks: "Who permitted these parties to speak for the 
nation and the people or even to speak for other political 
parties and forces, some of which, notably the Muslim 
Brotherhood, have a real presence in several associations and 
institutions, a presence that rivals--even exceeds--the 
political weight and influence of these parties? I am afraid 
the gambit has succeeded and the government's party [NDP] has 
lured other parties into doing exactly the same thing they used 
to criticize the government and its party for doing. Each of 
these parties used to proclaim, for all the world to hear, that 
those who can speak on behalf of the people or make decisions 
pertaining to any public affair must be freely elected by the 
people in an integrated democratic process. How can these 
parties now participate in choosing the delegates to a 
conference that will discuss political, economic, and 
intellectual problems, et cetera? Is it enough to bestow 
legitimacy on them that the delegates are chosen by six 
political parties?" 
  Al-Hudaybi continues: "We say frankly that each of these six 
political parties represents only itself." 
  He cites the Wafd Party's newspaper [AL-WAFD] as reporting 
on 
8 January 1994 that the 12 licensed political parties represent 
only 15 percent of the groups that speak for the nation. 
  In a special 300-word message to Labor Party Secretary 
General 'Adil Husayn published inside a box below the AL-SHA'B 
article, al- Hudaybi blames him for ignoring the Muslim 
Brotherhood in a recent article in which Husayn spoke of the 
need for political reform to enable the legal political parties 
to participate in elections. 
  Al-Hudaybi says: "I found that you limited the issue of 
political reform to expediting the exercise of political rights 
(elections). You repeatedly said that the elections should be 
held with the participation of what you called the legal 
parties. You did not say one word about the need to recognize 
other political forces, notably the Muslim Brotherhood. Your 
party carried it to the People's Assembly and it carried your 
party to the People's Assembly in the 1987 election. The same 
happened during the local elections of 1992. The Brotherhood 
established an Islamic alliance with your party, contesting the 
elections under the slogan 'Islam is the Solution.' This was 
originally a Muslim Brotherhood slogan." 
  Al-Hudaybi adds: "You also referred in your article to the 
State Security detectives' pursuit of the members of what you 
described as the legitimate parties. You did not say one word 
about their pursuit of and injustice to other political forces, 
as if you believe that these forces--not having obtained what 
you refer to as legitimacy--have no immunity and that their 
pursuit and confiscation of their means of livelihood no longer 
concern you, and that this is why you neglected to refer to them 
in any of the 10 principles mentioned in your article." 
  'Adil Husayn responds in a 700-word message published inside 
a box on page 5 of the 14 January edition of AL-SHA'B addressed 
to: "My brother Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi." 
  He says he can find no explanation for al-Hudaybi's remark 
that the political parties represent only themselves and reminds 
him that in their statement responding to the government's call 
for dialogue, the political parties agreed that the leaders and 
accredited representatives of the political parties and forces 
would take part in the dialogue. He advises him to resist the 
attempt to exclude the Muslim Brotherhood but not to reject the 
very idea of dialogue among the political parties and forces and 
the ruling party. 
  He declares: "Honorable brother, my opinion is known. It is 
that the Muslim Brotherhood must participate in any earnest 
political dialogue as an independent body, not via another 
party." 
  He adds: "It is strange that you should infer from my 
discussion of the legal guarantees we are demanding for the 
political parties that I am permitting the persecution of the 
Muslim Brotherhood. My dear sir, we are seeking to expand 
democracy so that the political forces that have not been 
recognized can be recognized, since they do have an undeniable 
presence." 
  Husayn expresses dissatisfaction with the "tone" of 
al-Hudaybi's article from "beginning to end." 
  He continues: "I did not feel comfortable with what you said 
about the Islamic alliance, particularly that the slogan 'Islam 
is the solution' is the Muslim Brotherhood's exclusive slogan. 
Actually it is the slogan of Muslims everywhere and in every 
age." 
  Husayn ends his response with a reference to the Labor 
Party's long-established Islamic credentials and addresses 
al-Hudaybi: "Concluding, my brother Counselor: The enemies of 
Islam are lying in wait for its advocates and concocting plots 
and sedition. We must be wary and vigilant. I still believe 
that what joins us together is the declaration: There is no God 
but God and Muhammad is his messenger. This is much more 
important than any differences between us. Brother counselor, I 
pray that God will clear the differences between you and me 
according to righteousness. May this chapter be closed."

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 19 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first 
Foreign Ministry under secretary and director of the President's 
Office for Political Affairs, has stated that the summit between 
Presidents al-Asad and Clinton was very important and that the 
Egyptian Government was aware of this from the beginning. 
  In an interview with Egyptian television on the "Good 
Morning 
Egypt" program today, Dr. al-Baz said that President Mubarak had 
a role in convening this meeting and in pushing matters forward. 
The meeting was held without delay because Egypt realized that 
such a meeting could produce positive results. 
  He added that Egypt is working toward one comprehensive 
agreement and not just agreements on some fronts. He stressed 
that Syria is one of the important parties in the peace process 
and that without movement on the Syrian track progress on the 
other tracks could be slow. 
  Dr. al-Baz said that the al-Asad-Clinton summit has had a 
positive impact, but this does not mean that an agreement was 
reached on specific issues to which Israel and Syria would be 
committed. The overall atmosphere and the assurances that could 
have been made in this meeting will, in our view, result in 
progress on the Syrian track. Dr. al-Baz expressed the hope 
that progress will be made on the Syrian track in the next few 
months. 
  Regarding Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's visit to 
Cairo tomorrow, Thursday, Dr. al-Baz said that this meeting is 
also important because, despite the signing of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, first in Oslo on 
20 August and then in Washington on 13 September, the 
declaration is general and negotiations are needed to ensure its 
implementation. These negotiations are extremely important. 
[passage omitted] 
  Dr. al-Baz also discussed the domestic situation. He 
emphasized that among President Mubarak's priorities is finding 
solutions to economic problems, particularly unemployment and 
price increases. Plans to upgrade education are also at the top 
of his priorities. 
  Concluding his interview, Dr. al-Baz said that attention is 
now being focused on internal and external issues to improve the 
internal situation.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Jan (MENA)--AL-AHRAM newspaper affirms 
that the available evidence on the al-Asad-Clinton summit in 
Geneva indicates that it was a good step toward stimulating the 
peace process, especially on the Syrian track, which has been 
inactive lately. 
  In its editorial Friday, the paper says that this is the 
first time that a genuine opportunity exists to normalize 
relations between Syria and Israel and that the ball is now in 
Israel's court. Israel, it adds, should respond to Syria's clear 
and forthright willingness to normalize relations with that 
country under a final peace accord. The paper calls on Israel 
to declare whether it is prepared for a complete withdrawal from 
the Golan. 
  In light of this, the paper notes, it can be said that the 
al- Asad-Clinton summit has been successful and that it will 
hold the door wide open for positive developments in the 
negotiations in Washington next week. Accordingly, the paper 
adds, we can say that 1994 will be a year of peace between Syria 
and Israel, which deserves to be called the peace of the brave.

<F P=106> [Report by Mahmud Bakri] </F>
  [Text] Al-SHA'B has learned that the U.S. Administration 
has conveyed a memorandum to some regional Arab countries 
containing the details of a U.S. plan that aims to exterminate 
Islamic fundamentalists this year. According to the memorandum, 
the step will be coordinated between the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency (C.I.A) [abbreviation in English] and the 
security services in these Arab countries. 
  The memorandum stressed that the cycle of fundamentalist 
terrorism has started to threaten particular regimes. It called 
for increasing financial aid by 30 percent to confront terrorism 
in the region. The U.S. plan calls for the following: 
  1. Signing a security agreement between the Arab countries 
and the United States on confronting religious terrorism; 
  2. Letting U.S. intelligence teams stay in the Arab 
countries permanently to survey the activities of the terrorist 
fundamentalists; 
  3. Intensifying punishment of detained terrorists; 
  4. Cornering [muhasarat] those states that support and 
harbor terrorist fundamentalists politically and economically. 
This is a reference to Sudan and Iran; 
  5. Expressing U.S. readiness to earmark part of its economic 
and military aid, granted to particular countries in the region, 
for confronting fundamentalist terrorism; and 
  6. Taking joint Arab-U.S. steps to establish a joint 
security committee that will cooperate with the U.S. 
intelligence service to curb and wipe out terrorism.

  [Text] Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi [official spokesman of 
the Muslim Brotherhood] left for Amman on 12 January to visit 
his daughter, who has been married to a Jordanian physician for 
20 years. Al-Hudaybi was surprised when the Jordanian 
authorities banned him from entering without giving any reason. 
The Jordanian authorities even prevented him from seeing his 
daughter, who was waiting for him at the incoming passengers 
gate at the airport. Al- Hudaybi was forced to return to Egypt 
on the same plane. 
  This should have never taken place and should not pass 
unnoticed. The Egyptian authorities should have adopted a 
position and performed their duty in defense of the dignity of 
its nationals, particularly those who are prominent and 
well-known symbols. We hope that the Jordanian authorities will 
reconsider their position. It is an unacceptable attitude even 
if it was in retaliation for the Egyptian authorities' 
preventing Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahman Khalifah, general guide of 
the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood, from entering Egypt. This is 
also unacceptable behavior.

  [Text] Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli 
delegation to the Taba talks, said a short while ago that the 
negotiations on the border crossings were stuck. Shahaq 
asserted that the disagreements between the parties centered on 
security arrangements at the crossings. Our correspondent 
Netan'el Semrik reports from Taba: 
  [Begin recording] [Semrik] Major General Amnon Shahaq, in 
his first public announcement this week, made it clear that the 
issue of the border crossings remained stuck. This, after an 
initial round of talks at Taba, the subsequent understandings 
reached at Oslo, Paris, and Cairo, and even after two days of 
negotiations at Taba this week. 
  [Shahaq] As for the security issues, we are still stuck on 
the issue of the border crossings. We are currently still 
trying to find ways to achieve maximum understanding and 
agreement; however, there are several matters of principle on 
which we disagree with the Palestinian delegation. We regard 
these issues as crucial to maintain the level of security we 
desire. There are several issues pertaining to the border 
crossings themselves which are tied to security arrangements. 
The disagreements between the two parties focus on these issues. 
  [Semrik] Do you think that the intervention of the prime 
minister and Yasir 'Arafat will be necessary on these issues? 
  [Shahaq] In my opinion, both parties are familiar with each 
other's position on the issue of the border crossings. We know 
what the Palestinians want and they know what we want. We have 
to find a way to agree or else there can be no accord. [end 
recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 19 January 
adds that "Major General Shahaq told our correspondent Moti Amir 
that the document detailing the points of agreement and 
disagreement between the two parties will be passed up to higher 
echelons. In the committee on civilian affairs, agreement was 
reached on transferring 25 out of the 35 Civil Administration 
offices to Palestinian control."]

  [Text] The Israeli Taba delegation is currently holding 
consultations after Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian 
delegation, submitted a new proposal regarding the border 
crossings issue. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports from Taba: 
  Over the last hour there were several developments here in 
Taba. At present there is a break in the discussions of the 
Security Affairs Committee. The Israeli representatives are 
holding consultations with Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of 
the Israeli delegation, and perhaps with Jerusalem as well, over 
a new proposal submitted by Dr. Nabil Sha'th a short time ago. 
  The Palestinian representatives in the committee were also 
summoned for consultations by Dr. Sha'th a short time ago. The 
only issue under discussion at the present time is the border 
crossings issue, which has been defined here as the key to all 
the security related issues under negotiations in Taba. 
  A senior source in the Palestinian delegation noted the new 
proposal on the border crossings issue submitted to Israel 
includes all the understandings attained in Oslo and Cairo, and 
is also based on the joint working paper formulated by 
representatives of the two delegations on the agreements and 
disagreements on this issue. According to the source the new 
proposal provides answers to all the security problems on the 
border crossings. In his opinion the Israeli representatives 
are delaying their answer to the proposal due to internal 
debates within the delegation, or due to other reasons which 
have to do with their desire to prevent the continuation of the 
discussions in the Security Affairs Committee. 
  According to the source, the Palestinian representatives in 
the committee have a full mandate from Yasir 'Arafat to attain 
an agreement on the border crossings issue. He added: This is 
precisely how we acted when we submitted the proposal and we do 
not need to ask Tunis anything. 
  Altogether it appears that the negotiations over the border 
crossings are stuck. Dr. Nabil Sha'th a short time ago 
confirmed he will travel to Cairo for a meeting with 'Arafat 
tomorrow morning. Later he will travel with 'Arafat to Oslo, 
where they are slated to meet Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres on 
Friday [21 January]. Sha'th said that as far as he is concerned 
the committees can continue their work tomorrow without the 
attendance of the delegation heads. Incidentally, Maj. Gen. 
Shahaq will apparently also travel to the Oslo meeting.

  [Excerpt] Taba, 19 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser and head 
of the Palestinian delegation to the Gaza-Jericho Committee, has 
stated that the Egyptian role is very important and something 
the Palestinians and the Israelis always want. 
  In a statement today, Dr. Sha'th said 'Arafat will ask 
President Husni Mubarak for Egyptian support for the peace 
process when they meet in Cairo tomorrow. 
  He pointed out that the Palestinian and Israeli delegations 
to the Security Affairs Committee reached no agreement on the 
crossings today. He noted that the Palestinian delegation 
submitted a written proposal setting out the points of agreement 
and disagreement on the crossings so that the two delegations 
would not have to discuss the issue from the beginning every 
time and so that the points of agreement and disagreement could 
be submitted to the political leaders of the two delegations to 
try to resolve them. The Israelis will respond to the 
Palestinian proposal tomorrow. 
  Dr. Sha'th said the Civilian Affairs Committee today 
discussed the water issue, saying that it is a difficult 
problem, particularly with regard to Gaza, requiring a concrete 
solution. 
  He affirmed that the Palestinian delegation submitted no new 
papers or proposals on the crossings in Gaza and Jericho or the 
border points between Egypt and Gaza and between Jordan and 
Jericho. He said the Israeli concept is that the crossings are 
an external security affair. Dr. Sha'th said this is the wrong 
interpretation and if they stick to it, it would be difficult to 
reach an agreement. He affirmed that the security at the 
crossings is a Palestinian and Israeli concern, not only 
Israeli. He explained that the crossings to Gaza and Jericho 
should be treated differently and that Israeli supervision 
should be inconspicuous, because Israel will withdraw from these 
two areas rather than the remaining parts of the West Bank. 
  He noted that Israel still has objections on this issue. And 
it has not agreed to place the crossings under international 
supervision. Dr. Sha'th affirmed that Israel is anxious about 
the results of the Geneva summit between Presidents Clinton and 
al-Asad. He said Israel is afraid that the U.S.-Syrian agreement 
will put pressure on it, pressure that will again steer the 
negotiations toward a comprehensive solution, as UN Security 
Council Resolution 242 called for Israeli withdrawal from all 
the occupied Arab territories, not part of them. The head of 
the Palestinian delegation said that despite the problems and 
obstacles facing the Gaza-Jericho Committee, the talks have not 
reached a stage requiring intervention by the United States as a 
cosponsor of the peace process in the area. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Taba, 19 Jan (MENA)--Jamil al-Turayfi, chairman of 
the Palestinian delegation to the Civilian Affairs Committee 
under the Gaza-Jericho Committee, has stated that tangible 
progress has been made in the work of the committee and that an 
agreement has been reached on transferring 25 functions from the 
Israeli to the Palestinian administration. 
  Speaking to reporters today, al-Turayfi said that an 
agreement on the transfer of four of these functions was reached 
at a meeting yesterday evening. These functions are: public 
works, natural preservations, arable land registration in Gaza, 
and civilian matters. 
  The Palestinian official added that no agreement has been 
reached so far on the transfer of 13 functions. They will be 
discussed during the next sessions. 
  Al-Turayfi noted that the Civilian Affairs Committee today 
began its discussion on the issue of transferring the water 
board authority from the Israeli to the Palestinian side. He 
believes that it will not be easy to reach an agreement on this 
matter in a single session. 
  Al-Turayfi affirmed that all the functions on which 
agreements were reached have been put in writing and signed by 
both sides. 
  Replying to a question on issuing Palestinian identification 
cards, he said that the committee has not completed its 
discussion of the issue and that it will be discussed during the 
next sessions. He noted that the committee will continue its 
works until Thursday evening. 
  In another development, 'Ami Gloska, official spokesman for 
the Israeli delegation, has stated that the two sides still 
disagree on certain points and that it is hard to tell when the 
talks will conclude. 
  Amnon Shahaq, Israeli deputy chief of staff and chairman of 
the Israeli delegation to the Gaza-Jericho Committee, said that 
there are essential differences between the two sides on the 
points the Security Committee is discussing, particularly the 
issue of the crossing points. He said that the talks will 
continue until tomorrow evening in an attempt to resolve these 
differences.

political adviser and head of the Palestinian delegation to the 
Gaza-Jericho Committee, left Taba earlier today for Cairo to 
take part in President 'Arafat's talks with President Husni 
Mubarak. [passage omitted] Dr. Nabil Sha'th said that the 
upcoming meeting of the Gaza-Jericho Committee will meet in Taba 
on Monday to discuss the area of the settlements in Gaza. He 
expressed hope that an agreement would be reached with the 
Israeli side on this matter. 
  On another aspect, during its meeting today the Civilian 
Affairs Committee will finalize discussions on transferring the 
water and electricity authority to the Palestinian side. The 
committee yesterday completed agreement on transferring 25 
authorities from the Israeli side to the Palestinian side. 
There are still 13 authorities open for negotiations. 
  It is worth mentioning that the Civilian Affairs Committee 
is 
chaired on the Palestinian side by Lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi, and 
on the Israeli side by Gadi Zohar, in charge of civil 
administration in the West Bank.

  [Text] The Israeli and Palestinian delegations in Taba 
have drafted a joint document on the issue of the border 
crossings which specifies all the points of disagreement between 
the parties. Hasan 'Asfur, deputy head of the Palestinian 
delegation, said that the document will be relayed to the two 
leaderships for perusal. According to 'Asfur, over the weekend 
the PLO leadership will decide whether to change the directives 
given to the delegation and whether the negotiations will resume 
next week on the basis of this document. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 20 January 
carries a live report from Taba by Netan'el Semrik, adding that 
"the points of disagreement remain -- as previously -- the 
issues of symbols and procedures for checking those entering and 
departing the autonomy. The document itself is four-pages long 
and includes several dozens clauses and subclauses dealing with 
the various issues."] 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the Civilian 
Affairs 
Committee postponed the scheduled discussion regarding the 
establishment of television and radio stations because the 
Palestinian expert did not arrive in Taba.

<F P=106> [Report by Mikha'el Rosolio and Arye Kiesel] </F>
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, at the conclusion of the second week 
of the latest round of Taba talks, the heads of the Israeli and 
PLO Security Committees managed to arrive at a mutually 
acceptable document. The four-page paper sums up the agreements 
-- but primarily the disagreements -- pertaining to the border 
crossings problem. [passage omitted] 
  The following are some of the points specified in the paper: 
  -- The parties agree that anything that is decided with 
regard to the Allenby Bridge border crossing will also apply to 
the other border crossings. 
  -- It is agreed that all the existing border crossings, 
including the crossings from Jordan and Egypt into Israel, as 
well as the crossings from the Green Line into the territories, 
will remain where they are to be used as border crossings in the 
future. 
  -- The parties agree that the crossings will be manned by a 
policing force that will wear nonmilitary dress uniforms similar 
to those worn by the security inspectors at the Taba border 
crossing. 
  -- Israel and the PLO -- each one individually -- want their 
own control at the border crossings and reject any attempt to 
entrust the crossings to a foreign element, such as the United 
Nations. 
  This is where the agreements end and the disagreements 
begin: 
  -- The PLO wishes to separate the crossings into the 
territories from the crossings into Israeli territory and to 
assume full control over the crossings into the territories. 
  -- The PLO wishes to decide on its own and without Israeli 
dictates who will be allowed into the territories and how 
visitors passports will be stamped. 
  -- Alternatively, if a joint border crossing is operated, 
the 
PLO wants its security inspector to be the first to receive each 
person reaching the crossing point and to determine whether that 
person may pass through. The PLO representative will have no 
authority over Israelis but will be the decisive authority in 
the case of foreign tourists. 
  -- Flags: The PLO wants its flag to be flown at each border 
crossing. In the case of a joint border crossing, it will be 
flown next to the Israeli flag.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Dahlan, member of the Palestinian </F>
Security Committee to the PLO-Israel Taba negotiations, by radio 
correspondent Basim Abu-Sumayyah; from the "Today's Guest" 
program; place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-Sumayyah] What are the tasks of the Security 
Committee in the negotiations? 
  [Dahlan] The Security Committee is part of the negotiating 
Palestinian delegation, which is divided into Civilian Affairs 
and Security Committees. The Security Committee is responsible 
for many issues. There are many personal opinions on the concept 
of the Taba talks Security Committee. However, the Security 
Committee discusses several important topics in the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement. The first issue is the 
crossings, the second is the borders of the Jericho area, the 
third is the settlements and the areas in the Gaza Strip. There 
is also the security of roads and communication lines, the 
Palestinian security movements, and the security of the 
movements of the Israeli settlers on Palestinian roads and the 
mechanism of coordinating this matter between us and the Israeli 
police. These are the most important issues that were mentioned 
in the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles [DOP]. 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] It has been reported in the Israeli media 
that 
a coordination agreement has been reached between the Israeli 
and Palestinian security bodies. Can you tell us about that? 
  [Dahlan] First of all, it is the Israeli side which always 
raises the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian coordination or 
rather the Israeli-Palestinian security coordination. This is a 
serious issue. They are well aware that it creates confusion 
among the Palestinians inside and outside the occupied 
territory. So far, there are no issues agreed on between us and 
the Israelis. Even in the DOP, there is no agreement or 
substantive progress in security matters that I have already 
mentioned. 
  Some Israeli papers have reported that progress has been 
made 
or a security coordination agreement reached between the 
Palestinian and Israeli security bodies. I would like to say 
that this is a sheer lie. There is no official or unofficial 
coordination between us and the Israeli security. We do not 
expect that in the near future there will be coordination on the 
concept of security coordination between us and the Israelis. 
However, there are measures that require coordination between 
us and the Israelis, matters related to the implementation of 
the DOP. For instance, the issue of the Palestinian police 
force, its tasks and duties, its measures, crossing into or out 
of Israeli areas, crossing into or out of the border crossing 
points. These are interconnected issues which have something to 
do with coordinating measures related to the police. They are 
also related to security measures but these are matters for the 
future. So far, the issue has not been discussed. This matter 
is discussed between us and the Israelis in the Taba 
negotiations and within the issue of crossings. How the 
Palestinians from the West Bank inhabitants can enter. This is 
one point. The second is how the inhabitants of Gaza and 
Jericho can enter. 
  The recent clamor was created by the Israeli side and the 
Israeli media. This is being done in a systematic, carefully 
planned manner because they are perfectly aware of the 
seriousness of portraying the issue of Palestinian-Israeli 
security coordination at this stage as a fact. This is part of 
the psychological war launched by the Israelis to benefit from 
confusing us as a Palestinian side to the negotiations. To the 
Palestinian mind, the issue of security coordination or 
cooperation is very difficult to digest. Moreover, the question 
of acceptance and coordination between us and the Israelis does 
not exist. We cannot forget that we spent many years in jail. 
Our people suffered many years of occupation. But the Israelis 
raised this issue in a carefully thought out manner. They 
disseminated these false statements. A statement was issued in 
my name in one of the Israelis papers in which I was quoted as 
saying that there was security coordination between the Israeli 
and Palestinian security bodies. This was denied and the denial 
was circulated among the Palestinian centers to clarify the 
picture and avoid entering into the Israeli labyrinth which will 
hinder our progress in the negotiations. 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] Speaking about the crossings issue, which is 
a basic security issue, what is the latest in this regard? 
  [Dahlan] Discussion of the crossings issue is revolving in 
circles and is subject to various opinions. We hope a 
breakthrough will be realized in the crossings issue. The 
Israeli side wants to supervise the crossings from the 
administrative and security viewpoints. We also want 
administrative and security supervision. We would like to reach 
a compromise on this issue because this portrays the image of 
the Palestinian authority. We want the Palestinian citizen to 
know that a change has been effected in his life, that a 
Palestinian policeman is meeting him, that a Palestinian 
policeman is taking care of his administrative papers. We do not 
want the Palestinian citizens to face humiliation and oppression 
as has been the case in the past. At least we want coordination 
in all administrative matters that the Palestinians need on the 
crossing points in addition to some aspects of security 
measures, entry and departure as well as other issues that 
require coordination between us and the Israeli side. 
  However, the Israeli side has so far been insisting on a 
comprehensive security and administrative supervision of the 
crossings. Our position is clear and instructions by the 
brother president ['Arafat] on this issue are very clear. I do 
not think that any Palestinian will accept less than we are 
presenting at the negotiations table. 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] Last question. It has been reported recently 
that Israel links the question of releasing Palestinian 
detainees with the question of an amnesty by the Palestinians 
concerning collaborators with the Israeli authorities. What do 
you say to that? 
  [Dahlan] This question is also connected with the security 
coordination which was reported in the Israeli papers. This 
issue prompted the Israeli side to disseminate a fabricated 
statement attributed to me on the coordination issue. At that 
time I dealt with the collaborators. We said that the families 
and children of collaborators are Palestinians and we will take 
care of them from the social and financial viewpoints and will 
treat them just like other Palestinians. However, the issue of 
collaborators has always been and will continue to be a very 
sensitive subject for us. We are still adhering to our stand 
that this issue provokes our people. We will revise the issue of 
the agents. Those who deserve to remain among the Palestinians 
will be welcomed and we will ask the Israeli side to solve the 
problems related to those who do not deserve that. Let them take 
them to their areas, in the same way the Netherlands treated 
such people. 
  [Abu-Sumayyah] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Report by Hasan Abu-Zayid from Taba, from the "With the </F>
Events" program] 
  [Text] A round of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations was 
concluded in Taba this evening. On the Security Committee, 
which discussed the issue of border crossings, the Israeli and 
Palestinian sides have reached an agreement on a joint working 
paper specifying the points of agreement and disagreement 
concerning border crossings. In other words, there is no 
progress on the Security Committee's talks, and the border 
crossings remained the obstacle hindering any progress on this 
committee's talks. 'Ami Glusqa, spokesman for the Israeli 
delegation said that the two sides have drafted a joint working 
paper covering the two sides' stands on all that is related to 
the border crossings, which hinder any progress on the talks of 
the Security Committee. 
  At the end of the session, Hasan 'Asfur, deputy head of the 
Palestinian team, said that the problem of border crossings will 
be discussed again during the next round of talks on Monday [24 
January]. 
  [Begin recording] ['Asfur] The meetings were businesslike. A 
joint document has been drafted. We will start new discussions 
on these topics on Monday. The discussions are difficult. We 
do not expect speedy solutions. We are working hard to bridge 
the points of disagreement. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Does this mean the question of crossings will be 
discussed again in Taba? 
  ['Asfur] Next week, we will continue discussions on the 
question of crossings. This week's discussions on this issue 
were more businesslike than in the previous sessions. 
  [Abu-Zayid] What about other topics? 
  ['Asfur] There are others on the agenda, but we should 
finish 
this issue since we have already started with it. 
  [Abu-Zayid] With respect to the crossings question, will it 
be raised during the 'Arafat-Peres meeting this week? 
  ['Asfur] It is the right of the Palestinian people's 
leadership and the Israeli Government to discuss any issue. 
  [Abu-Zayid] But we have noticed that you have reached a dead 
end with respect to the question of border crossings? 
  ['Asfur] Had we arrived at a dead end, we would not have 
agreed to meet again. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Yes, but this question has taken enough time? 
  ['Asfur] It may take more time. We are not discussing time, 
but a solution. We know that these are difficult negotiations 
between two sides that have fought each other for a long time. 
Reaching a solution is not as easy as some believe. 
  [Abu-Zayid] How important is the paper that you drafted 
today 
for the essence of the negotiations on the crossings? 
  ['Asfur] The paper has set a general perspective about all 
the issues that we should discuss. So, we will not have to 
exchange papers again or to present a detailed paper by each 
side. We have drafted a paper which specifies all the issues 
that we must discuss. [end recording] 
  The Civilian Affairs Committee, which is headed by Attorney 
Jamil al-Tarifi for the Palestinians and Brigadier General Gadi 
Zohar for the Israelis, discussed the electricity issue. Also, 
the committee raised the question of launching a Palestinian 
television and radio for the first time. We have learned that 
tangible progress was achieved during today's session of the 
Civilian Affairs Committee. Attorney Jamil al-Tarifi said: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Tarifi] We have completed discussions 
on the registration of residents and documents. Up to this 
moment, Palestinian and Israeli experts are continuing 
discussions on the question of electricity. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Is there progress on the discussions of the 
Civilian Affairs Committee? 
  [Al-Tarifi] We expect so, God willing. 
  [Abu-Zayid] What about the question of the Palestinian radio 
and television? 
  [Al-Tarifi] Our experts have not arrived yet. We are 
expecting their arrival from Cairo. If they do not arrive 
today, we will hold this issue until next week, God willing. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Will the committee hold another session today? 
  [Al-Tarifi] God willing. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Is there progress on the Security Committee. 
  [Al-Tarifi] God willing. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Attorney Jamil al-Tarifi, is there a linkage 
between the talks of the Civilian Affairs and Security 
Committees. 
  [Al-Tarifi] In the final analysis, everything is linked to 
everything else. This is because there can be no comprehensive 
agreement by the Civilian Affairs Committee without an agreement 
on security issues. This is so there will only be one agreement. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Has a specified formula been reached on the 
issues that have been agreed upon? 
  [Al-Tarifi] Yes, a specified formula has been reached 
between 
us and the Israelis on the transfer of all the powers that have 
been agreed upon. [end recording] 
  Brigadier General Gadi Zohar, head of the Israeli team at 
the 
committee said that there is progress on this committee. He 
said: 
  [Begin recording] [Zohar] During this round of talks, we 
discussed a host of civilian issues, including electricity, 
which we are discussing today, passports, identification cards, 
etcetera. Contrary to our wishes, there is no speedy progress. 
There is still a lot to be done. This takes time. 
  [Abu-Zayid] When will you finish all issues pertaining to 
the 
Civilian Affairs Committee? 
  [Zohar] Who knows? When we reach an agreement, we know that 
we have finished our mission. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian </F>
delegation to the Taba talks, by Hasan Abu-Zayid in Taba on 20 
January, from the "With the Midday Events" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-Zayid] How do you evaluate today's round of 
talks? 
  [Sha'th] I think that progress was made today and yesterday. 
I cannot say it is progress in substance, but in method. 
Progress in method sometimes opens the door for progress in 
substance. We always began from the starting point. When we 
resume talks, we also begin from the starting point. Therefore, 
the talks were haunted by a ghost called the crossings problem. 
Today, I think we agreed on the exact points of agreement and 
disagreement in the problem of the crossings so that we will not 
again start from zero when talks begin, whether in Taba or on a 
higher level when the leaders or foreign ministers meet. This, 
in my opinion, is the basic progress made. This progress is 
represented in the two sides' readiness to agree to the points 
of agreement and disagreement so that we will not start afresh 
when we discuss the issue of the crossings once again. We might 
later say the problem is not one of crossings, but of the points 
that are still controversial. Progress also continued vis-a-vis 
the issue of civil administration. I think that except for the 
Paris negotiations, which will determine the method of 
transferring power in economic issues, only the water problem 
remains. I do not want to downplay the importance of the water 
problem; it is a difficult problem in the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
It is difficult for the Palestinians, especially in Gaza. It 
is the only remaining problem and needs to be solved. All the 
rest deals with the method. Hence, we can really say that by 
the end of tomorrow nothing will practically remain except the 
issue of water. 
  [Abu-Zayid] If no agreement is reached in Taba, will the 
issue of border crossings be discussed in Oslo or elsewhere? 
  [Sha'th] I do not know what will exactly be discussed in 
Oslo. What is certain is that these negotiations are continuing. 
If Oslo presents an opportunity to solve some problems, we will 
naturally seize that opportunity. Nevertheless, these 
negotiations are continuing. Next Monday, delegations of the 
Security and Civilian Affairs Committees will meet as usual. 
  [Abu-Zayid] What do you expect from the Peres-'Arafat Oslo 
meeting this week? 
  [Sha'th] The meeting is basically Arab, that is, the aim of 
going to Oslo is to pay tribute to late Norwegian Minister 
Holst. We--President 'Arafat and I--are going there to take part 
in his funeral. Minister Peres is also going there to offer his 
condolences. But there will be an opportunity to meet. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Will that opportunity be enough to benefit from 
this meeting and reach an agreement? 
  [Sha'th] That might be possible. If this happens, I will 
undoubtedly be happy. The Norwegian ambassador here told me: 
Holst's soul will rejoice if you reach a peace agreement even 
during his funeral because he lived and died for peace. 
Consequently, Holst's soul will not be distressed if you seize 
the opportunity of his funeral to get closer to peace. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Will 'Arafat today ask for an Egyptian 
intervention to bring the Israeli-Palestinian views closer? 
  [Sha'th] The Egyptian intervention in the negotiations is 
always desirable by us and apparently by the Israeli side. 
There has been no objection to this constructive role by Egypt. 
Therefore, President 'Arafat's meeting with President Husni 
Mubarak will certainly be an important meeting during which 
President 'Arafat will fully brief President Mubarak on 
developments and ask for an Egyptian backing of the peace 
process. 
  [Abu-Zayid] Will the Palestinian side take part in the 
Washington talks and who will lead the Palestinian delegation? 
  [Sha'th] I do not know if anyone has been selected to lead 
the Palestinian delegation to Washington or at least to attend 
the meeting the heads of delegations will hold in Washington 
shortly. However, I think it might be Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat because 
he was deputy chairman of the previous delegation led by Dr. 
Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi. Consequently, it is logical to have him 
there, but this depends on President 'Arafat's decision.

  [Excerpts] Taba, Egypt, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Israel and the PLO 
agreed to disagree on Thursday [20 January] after another round 
of negotiations that failed to break the stalemate over who 
controls border crossings once Palestinian self-rule is 
launched. [passage omitted] 
  A senior aide to PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, who was in Cairo 
on Thursday, warned the peace process could run out of steam if 
there was no breakthrough within weeks. 
  "I believe we have a few weeks in front of us and if these 
problems are not resolved in weeks I think the whole Declaration 
of Principles and the process will be in danger," Yasir 
'Abdrabbuh told reporters in the capital. 
  "I don't think they have the luxury of time in order to wait 
for months. They need a quick solution as we do," he said, 
referring to Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres who said 
Wednesday that his country could afford to wait. 
  The chief PLO negotiator, Nabil Sha'th, said the Taba 
meetings had produced "some opening." Although a security deal 
is proving elusive, he has reported progress on the hand-over of 
civilian powers to the Palestinians. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] Egypt is trying to reduce the tension with 
Israel that has surfaced in the multilateral arms control talks. 
Nabil Fahmi, an aide to the Egyptian foreign minister and head 
of the Egyptian delegation to the arms control talks, yesterday 
visited Israel for a meeting with David 'Ivri, director general 
of the Defense Ministry and head of the Israeli delegation. 
  In this first-of-its-kind direct meeting between the Israeli 
and Egyptian representatives to the arms control talks, the 
sides were able to attain understandings that will prevent 
unnecessary bickering in the upcoming meeting in Cairo planned 
later this month between all the countries participating in the 
multilateral arms control talks. 
  The controversy between Egypt and Israel has centered on 
Egyptian diplomatic efforts to disarm Israel of its nuclear 
capacity and its demand to raise the nuclear issue in the 
multilateral talks as soon as possible. 
  Israel, on the other hand, demands to start the process by 
implementing confidence-building-measures between the region's 
countries, and to delay the nuclear issue until stable peace 
arrangements are implemented in the area. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The meetings of the follow-up ministerial 
committee of the second conference for information ministers of 
Islamic states began in Cairo today. The information ministers 
of Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia, and delegations 
representing Kuwait, the Sultanate of Oman, Palestine, Malaysia, 
Senegal, and the General Secretariat of the Islamic Conference 
Organization are taking part in these meetings. 
  Addressing the conference, Information Minister Muhammad 
Salman spoke about the importance of this meeting. He said: 
This meeting is aimed at following up the implementation of 
resolutions and recommendations reached during the previous 
conference. It is being held during critical circumstances in 
light of major international developments. This requires us to 
increase our coordination and integrate our joint efforts to 
implement these resolutions and recommendations. This should 
guarantee more strength and effectiveness for our joint efforts 
in the media field in order to reinforce the prestige and role 
of the peoples of our Islamic states in the world community and 
assist them to achieve progress, growth, and freedom under a new 
international order that is not established at the expense of 
our Islamic peoples but based on the principle of equality, 
parity, dialogue, and positive and constructive interaction 
among peoples. This new international order should guarantee 
for our peoples the achievement of freedom and sovereignty on 
their territories and the realization of a just and 
comprehensive peace that returns the occupied Arab territories 
in Palestine, southern Lebanon, and the Golan to their owners. 
This peace should also secure the rights of the Arabs and 
Muslims to holy Jerusalem, the Muslims' first qiblah [the 
direction a Muslim faces while praying], as emphasized in the 
Cairo media declaration issued in the second conference held by 
the information ministers of Islamic states. 
  The information minister also called for further 
coordination 
among Islamic states in all media fields in order to enhance the 
effectiveness of the media in Islamic states by taking advantage 
of new technological developments to accentuate the image of 
Islam and Muslims in a manner that confirms the importance of 
Islam and its great role in emphasizing respect for the human 
being and his right to justice, peace, progress, and freedom. 
Dr. Muhammad Salman added: Syria has participated in this 
march of our Islamic states toward joint media action from the 
time it was first launched at the conference in Jeddah, out of 
its firm belief in the great role that could be played within 
this joint Islamic framework in serving the issues of our 
countries and lifting injustice and deceit. Syria believes that 
the rapid international changes require us to focus on practical 
solutions and realistic visions in order to serve our joint 
causes. We believe that this meeting and the resulting 
recommendations will be an additional and blessed step which we 
hope will further strengthen this joint media action aimed at 
serving our people's interests. 
  Dr. Muhammad Salman arrived in Cairo this afternoon to take 
part in the meetings of the follow-up ministerial committee of 
the second conference for information ministers of Islamic 
states which is scheduled to last two days. He was received at 
Cairo International Airport by Egyptian Information Minister 
Safwat al-Sharif, Syria's Ambassador in Cairo Dr. 'Isa Darwish, 
the two assistants of the Egyptian information minister, and a 
number of top Information Ministry officials. 
  Dr. Muhammad Salman responded to reporters' questions at the 
airport. He said he was happy to meet with Safwat al-Sharif, 
the information minister of sisterly Egypt, which is taking part 
in the meetings of the follow-up committee of the conference 
held by the information ministers of Islamic states. He said: 
During the committee's meetings, we will discuss the means to 
formulate recommendations that will help guide our future action 
in the media field. 
  Responding to a question on media cooperation between Syria 
and Egypt, the minister said: We are working together for the 
integration of the Syrian and Egyptian media in various arenas. 
He added: The Egyptian information minister and I are seeking 
to achieve a new qualitative move toward developing these 
relations in order to reaffirm political relations between the 
two countries and between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Husni 
Mubarak. 
  On the results of the Geneva summit, the information 
minister 
said: The summit was clear. Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill 
Clinton openly responded to all questions. It remains for the 
Israeli side to respond to the results of the summit. 
  Dr. Salman spoke about the role of the Syrian media after 
the 
Geneva summit and said: The media do not represent an 
independent policy, but embody the Syrian policy trends on 
various levels. He added: We are seeking to develop and 
promote the media up to the level of the policy drawn and led by 
President Hafiz al-Asad. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Many Army officers tendered their resignations to 
the commander in chief of the Armed Forces last week to protest 
the deteriorating military establishment. In their resignation 
letters, the officers said they rejected a new escalation of war 
in the south and a government plan to send a military expedition 
to the south comprising nationalist officers who are not 
affiliated with the National Islamic Front. The plan is seen as 
a government attempt to liquidate these officers in war. 
  The "Brothers" learned that the commander in chief has not 
yet replied to the resignations, both because the Army needs the 
officers' expertise and because there is no cash to pay the 
allowance to which they would be entitled.

  [Text] Khartoum, Jan. 20, IRNA -- Sudan's first deputy 
foreign minister, 'Umar Berido [name as received], here Thursday 
termed as baseless the smear campaign launched by the global 
arrogance both against Khartoum and Tehran to portray them as 
terorrists. 
  Interviewed by IRNA, Berido said that economic and political 
stability in Iran and Sudan prompted the global arrogance to 
make such accusations. He stressed that the global arrogance 
which attributed terorristic activities to Iran and Sudan has 
remained silent towards atrocities being committed against 
Muslims in Palestine and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Berido said that 
definitely the two countries will overcome the difficulties with 
the help of God. 
  Commenting on Tehran-Khartoum relations, the Sudanese 
official said bilateral ties enjoy special sigfnificance and are 
deep and friendly.

  [Excerpts] The gates of Saharan security centers in Algeria 
have been opened; some of the 780 Islamist prisoners in these 
security centers have been released. [passage omitted] 
  A reaction from Rabah Kebir, one of the leaders of the 
Islamic Salvation Front in exile: He says these measures are 
insufficient: 
  [Begin Kebir recording] I am very pleased about the release 
of some of our brothers who were imprisoned wrongly and without 
trial in concentration camps and who have been there for two 
years now. This is not enough, however, because thousands of 
our brothers are still in prison, such as our leaders, first of 
all. 
  As for the national dialogue conference, as far as we are 
concerned, the junta in power is not to be taken seriously. 
That is why this conference has no chance of success. It is 
only a propaganda ploy to gain time. Should they ever want a 
negotiable solution, all they have to do is to look at the one 
condition we set during our news conference on 17 August 1993. 
It is no use giving us little presents to cheer us up. We are 
not children. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri by </F>
Abel Coelho de Morais; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Coelho] A conference for 
national dialogue which is to determine Algeria's future is 
currently being prepared. Are you afraid that this initiative 
will lead to a dead end, in view of the intention not to attend 
that has already been expressed by various political forces? 
  [Dembri] Two important processes of reforms are unfolding in 
Algeria, one linked to the political transition and the other 
concerning the economic reforms. In the first case, we are 
trying without exceptions to secure an agreement on the 
transitional period, which should not exceed three years. The 
conference will take place 25-26 January, and the platform and 
the institutions will be determined at it. 
  When this aim has been achieved, the country will be 
administered until the holding of presidential and legislative 
elections within a maximum period of three years, which could, 
however, be brought forward. 
  With respect to the economic reform, this is aimed at 
achieving a market economy. The legal instruments for running 
the transition and undertaking the reforms of the central bank's 
regulations have already been created. Last, we are negotiating 
with the IMF our foreign debt and the structural adjustments in 
our economy, a process which should be completed by the end of 
the month. 
  [Coelho] But this strategy does not in itself exhaust the 
fundamentalists' demands... 
  [Dembri] We know that the security issue worries other 
countries, but I can say that the terrorist actions which have 
occurred in Algeria do not necessarily originate inside the 
country. They are connected with the international situation, 
and they stem from the deterioration of the economic situation 
in the Third World. 
  [Coelho] Are you not concerned about the absence of 
important political parties from the dialogue proposed by the 
government? 
  [Dembri] There have been organizations which decided to take 
part and which later backtracked, but we must not despair. 
Algeria needs everybody. Only two conditions are set: 
Renouncing violence and respect for the constituent elements of 
the national identity. 
  [Coelho] "Without exception" includes organizations or 
figures linked to the fundamentalists... 
  [Dembri] The fundamentalists were not considered in 
particular. Everybody is accepted, provided that they accept 
the criteria which I mentioned. 
  [Coelho] Is the release of fundamentalist militants over the 
past few days a signal to the Islamic Salvation Front? 
  [Dembri] The invitations to the conference were made on the 
basis of openness. In this context, the measures adopted by the 
authorities reflect their idea of the normal running of the 
state and society... 
  [Coelho] Following the conference and with the winding up of 
the High State Committee, what kind of solution will be adopted 
during the transitional period which you propose? 
  [Dembri] There will be a presidential council, a government, 
and a transitional council comprising 180 people, which will 
function as a parliament, overseeing the government's activity. 
  [Coelho] And who will form the government? 
  [Dembri] According to the constitutional rules, the head of 
government, but, in view of the nature of the transitional 
period, it is clear that the choices will be made on the basis 
of openness. 
  [Coelho] You mentioned agreements which are about to be 
signed with the IMF. What are Algeria's economic priorities? To 
accelerate the reforms? 
  [Dembri] First, the debt must be treated in a way which will 
enable us to achieve a market economy without major social 
tensions. We hope that the IMF will not apply too strong a 
remedy for our economic system. We have an industrial system 
which we must set on its feet again, agriculture also needs 
major investments, and it is necessary to create jobs and boost 
public works. We hope that the negotiation with the IMF and the 
World Bank will not impose on us excessively tough structural 
adjustment measures: "constraints," as they are called in the 
IMF's language. 
  [Coelho] Within the framework of Algeria's strategy of a 
stronger link and cooperation with Europe, how would you define 
your country's relations with the European Union [EU] right now? 
  [Dembri] The EU holds the first place in our foreign trade. 
We wish to strengthen that cooperation through an agreement 
whose long-term aim will be the creation of a free trade area 
covering the Twelve and Algeria. Two lines of cooperation have 
already been defined by the EU -- one in the direction of the 
former USSR, the other aimed at the southern flank, the 
Mediterranean, and the Maghreb countries. 
  [Coelho] The dialogue between Europe and the Maghreb within 
the framework of the Five Plus Five group is deadlocked. Is it 
feasible to surmount the deadlock, or must alternative ways be 
sought in order not to lose this stage of cooperation between 
the two sides of the Mediterranean? 
  [Dembri] The dialogue within the framework of the Five Plus 
Five group is deadlocked owing to one problem -- the Lockerbie 
case. There is explicit opposition on the part of certain 
European countries to any Five Plus Five group meeting attended 
by the Maghreb country targeted over this affair (Libya). On 
the other hand, the nature of the Mediterranean area's problems 
requires constant consultation. So what is to be done? Either 
we move toward bilateral consultation processes or we must find 
a formula which will enable us to continue to meet. It is at 
this point that we find ourselves. 
  [Coelho] Algeria is following the Israeli-Arab dialogue as 
an interested party. What do you expect of the agreement 
between Tel Aviv and the PLO? What kind of relationship is 
beginning between Israel and the Arabs? 
  [Dembri] The agreement on Jericho and Gaza must develop 
favorably as a first step toward an overall solution to the 
Middle East problem. There must also be appropriate treatment 
of everything concerning the Palestinian problem, the 
establishment of a sovereign Palestinian entity, and the 
resolution of other regional problems, including Syria's 
relations with Israel and Lebanon's relations with Israel. 
  But this is not the only international problem that worries 
us. There is another.... 
  [Coelho] Which? 
  [Dembri] Bosnia, which is suffering terribly. Hence we want 
Europe and the international community to pledge to end this 
tragedy, the aggression against Bosnia's Muslims to cease, and 
the Bosnian unitary state to be safeguarded within the borders 
recognized by the international community.... 
  [Coelho] How? 
  [Dembri] It must not be forgotten that Bosnia became a UN 
member following a referendum held in the country at the 
international community's request. There are decisions by the 
international community which must be respected, but we should 
not forget that the embargo on Bosnia now mainly harms the 
Bosnians -- not their Serbian aggressors.

  [Text] Algiers -- A high-level Algerian source has 
revealed to AL-HAYAH that during his recent European tour 
Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri read details of a report 
aimed at removing Major General Khaled Nezzar. The source 
stated that "a general known for his hard-line position toward 
Islamists and his hostility to the Arab, Islamic line is in 
charge of the plan." The source stated that this general "has 
great influence inside the military and enjoys Maj. Gen. 
Nezzar's confidence." 
  The source added: "According to the report, the general in 
question (he declined to reveal his name) assigned a group of 
retired colonels in the military security organ to conduct a 
secret investigation to identify the quarters behind the bombing 
operations not attributed to Islamic groups. The results of the 
investigation revealed Maj. Gen. Nezzar's responsibility for 
them, including the attempt on his life and the attempt on the 
life of Gen. Toufik, chief of the military security organ." 
  The source stated that a European official "put Dembri in 
the 
picture with regard to the report, telling him that the general 
himself convinced his colleagues and a number of colonels that 
Nezzar is responsible for what has happened to the country and 
for the losses inflicted on the military and that his insistence 
on the method of holding a dialogue with the fundamentalists 
will eventually lead to handing over power to the Islamic 
Salvation Front." The source added that the European official 
stressed to Dembri "the existence of a petition signed by senior 
officers, urging Nezzar's removal in preparation for a coup to 
be led by the military's hard-line general." The report 
indicates that Nezzar's adversaries accuse him of monopolization 
and have detected "several secret contacts" he made with 
Salvation Front leaders via various channels, "including 
assigning Mohamed Cherif Messaadia, former secretary general of 
the National Liberation Front, to make contacts with the 
Islamists. He was seen frequenting a villa in the Draria area, 
west of the capital." The report stresses that Messaadia "was 
the target of an assassination or abduction attempt but the 
security services foiled it."

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] The Iraqi newspapers AL-'IRAQ, AL- 
JUMHURIYAH, and AL-THAWRAH, in their 17 January editions, 
commemorate the third anniversary of the Gulf war. The 
editorials of these newspapers, as well as several inside 
articles, lavish praise on the "Mother of Battles," and commend 
the Iraqi leadership's performance during the Gulf crisis and 
war. The Baghdad newspapers AL-QADISIYAH and BABIL 17 January 
editions, have not thus far been received by Jordan Bureau. 
  Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH, publishes on pages 1, 2, a 600-word 
article by Salah al-Mukhtar celebrating the salvation of Iraq 
under Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. It says: "Iraq has 
survived the military aggression ordeal, during which the 
weapons of the 21st century produced to defeat the then second 
world superpower (the Soviet Union) were used. The potential 
for renaissance and reconstruction in Iraq remained intact. 
Thus, Iraq thwarted the centerpiece of the Western-Zionist 
scheme, which was the destruction of the potential for 
renaissance and progress in Iraq, as well as the elimination of 
the creative political and technological mind behind this 
renaissance and progress." 
  The writer describes the "30-state aggression" as an 
"existential challenge" that elicited determination and 
strengthened the national will to rebuild the country, enhance 
steadfastness, and uphold principles, and national independence. 
He maintains that Iraq's performance during the Gulf war has 
earned it the admiration of "freedom fighters everywhere." 
Consequently, the writer argues, world peoples have chosen to 
walk the path of national resistance to fight U.S. attempts at 
"domination." 
  The writer cites the examples of starving Somalia and, 
alluding to the former Soviet Union, "superpowers" that 
disintegrated and became "Third World" nations. He says that 
"an open and strong spirit of resistance to U.S. colonialism has 
been stepped up. Consequently, U.S. colonialism suffered a 
string of abysmal defeats in 1993. For, U.S. agents and the 
advocates of (market economy) have been defeated. Moreover, the 
forces advocating freedom, socialism, and independence triumphed 
in several European states." 
  The writer contends that these "positive changes, which are 
bound to bring closer the dawn of freedom as well as the final 
defeat of U.S. colonialism, have taken place because other 
peoples have learned the lessons provided by the Mother of 
Battles. These peoples have benefited from these lessons in 
their struggle against attempts at domination. The major lesson 
learned was that steadfastness is the midwife that helps produce 
almost impossible results." 
  Concluding his article, the writer maintains that "the 
Achilles heel of U.S. colonialism lies in creating several 
Mothers of Battles." He adds: "Each and every people must 
prepare for their own Mother of Battles. For, when there are 
several resistance arenas all over the world, the United States 
will find itself compelled to retreat into its own cocoon as a 
result of its intrinsic impotence, and also because it does not 
have the components required for colonizing the universe." 
  An editorial in AL-'IRAQ newspaper, on pages 1, 6, cites 
the speech delivered by Iraqi President Saddam Husayn on the 
occasion on 16 January 1994, filed as second referent item. 
  The 600-word editorial commends the "steadfastness and 
heroism" demonstrated in the "Mother of Battles." It carries 
brief excerpts from the speech Saddam delivered on 16 January 
1994. The editorial says: "Erroneous calculations lead to 
erroneous results. That is why evildoers, once again, became 
hostage to their lopsided and parochial perspective when they 
thought that their extraordinary and ferocious aggression was 
enough to bring Iraq to its knees so that they could force their 
dictates on it, and consequently make an example of it to 
terrorize the world, as leader President Saddam Husayn has said 
in the historic speech he has delivered marking the third 
anniversary of the great showdown of the Mother of Battles." 
  The editorial maintains that the calculations of the United 
States and its allies were mistaken, "thanks to the Iraqis' 
nobility, strong faith in the justness of their cause, and their 
legendary steadfastness." The editorial describes the "Mother 
of Battles" as "the epic of the 20th century." 
  AL-THAWRAH newspaper, in a 1,500 word editorial on pages 1, 
7, commends Iraq's performance during the Gulf crisis and war. 
The editorial begins by saying: "January 17, 1991 will 
continue to be remembered as the date on which the Arab nation's 
collective consciousness was born." 
  Celebrating this event, the paper says: "The annals of 
history have registered that Iraq, in terms of its leaders, 
will, human individual, faith, and role, is an unerasable fact 
of the age. For 100,000 air raids, which reflect the 
colonialist West's utmost evil potential, have failed to dent 
Iraq's standing or will. The three years that separate us from 
this event only clarify facts. For, the open and disgraceful 
subservience to the U.S.-Zionist camp by the Arabs of the desert 
has been consummated, whereas Iraq's continuing to uphold honor, 
pride, sovereignty, progress, and principles has become an 
indisputable fact. 
  "After three years of hard work, glory, honor, patience, 
steadfastness, and sacrifices, the Iraqis, who have upheld the 
message, stand firmer and continue to uphold right. Nothing of 
all that has happened has undermined the principles of right and 
honor. Nothing of that has dented the historicity of the 
leadership, nor its glorious and great positions. 
  "For the past three years, the Iraqis have confirmed to the 
whole universe that their progress, standing, and their 
credentials to the age of industry is not a product of their 
consumption of Western industries and expertise. For, Western 
bombs destroyed the Western industry assembled on Iraqi 
territory. However, the Iraqis have rebuilt and reconstructed 
their industries under the circumstances of a sweeping embargo 
to say that new Iraq, the Iraq of Saddam Husayn, is standing on 
its feet, that it is in good shape, and that the new Iraqi 
individual is the most important element Saddam Husayn has built 
on Iraqi territory. " 
  The editorial underscores Iraq's political discourse, saying 
that "all lies have collapsed, that all masks have been torn 
apart, and that the confrontation has melted all dyes, and 
removed all delusions." 
  The editorial also assails Iran's involvement in the Gulf 
war, saying that this shows that Iran's "medieval perspective is 
linked to the West's colonialist plan, which is targeting the 
pan-Arab renaissance plan spearheaded and epitomized by Iraq." 
The paper says that this indicates that Iran cannot harbor good 
intentions for the Arabs and Muslims. 
  Discussing the same topic in an approximately 900-word 
frontpage editorial on 16 January, Baghdad AL-JUMHURIYAH notes 
that the "Mother of Battles has produced a new trend in the 
world that exposed the falsity of the "New World Order" promoted 
by Washington and the Zioniost quarters. The Mother of Battles 
has dealt a strong blow to Bush and his allies. It humiliated 
them and forced them to admit, secretly and in the open, that 
the Iraq of leader Saddam Husayn is a home to the knights and 
the mujahidin who have an unyielding will in both the 
battlefield and in the fields of work."

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Jan (INA)--Iraq has once again protested 
to the Arab League over the continued violations of the Iraqi 
airspace by U.S., British, and French aircraft, which are 
provided with facilities by the rulers of Saudi Arabia and 
Kuwait. These violations pose a grave threat to Iraq's 
security, stability, and national unity. 
  In a letter to Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 
'Abd-al- Majid, Iraq's permanent envoy said on 14, 15, and 16 
January, these aircraft continued their violations of the Iraqi 
airspace and conducted 129 hostile sorties by flying from bases 
in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
  The Iraqi envoy asked that the letter be distributed to the 
Arab member states. A list detailing these violations was 
enclosed.

  [Text] It was announced at the UN Security Council [UNSC] 
last night that the UNSC held unofficial consultations and 
failed to agree that the conditions required for lifting the 
embargo imposed on Iraq have been met. 
  This decision was expected at this point in time. However, 
reliable diplomatic sources there have said that the next UNSC's 
review of the embargo, due to be held in March, will witness 
further positive developments, and that these developments will 
push for the lifting of the embargo imposed on Iraq. 
  A diplomatic source has explained to the Iraqi News Agency 
correspondent in New York that a reading of the positions of the 
UNSC members during yesterday's consultations strongly show a 
flexible British position, particularly since the speech 
delivered by the British representative to the United Nations 
during the UNSC consultations was free of any strong accusations 
or additional conditions. 
  The source added that there is evidence that the British 
position will be better during the next consultations the UNSC 
will hold in March, when the political stage will be set for the 
lifting of the sanctions. 
  Other sources said that the UNSC consultations have almost 
seen a consensus on the need to lift the sanctions. All UNSC 
members, except U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, called for 
lifting the sanctions. 
  In a statement to reporters yesterday, French ambassador to 
the United Nations Jean-Bernard Merime affirmed that the French 
position on Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 has remained 
unchanged. He said Iraq's position on this paragraph should be 
the yardstick to be heeded for lifting the oil embargo imposed 
on Iraq. He added that things will be good when Rolf Ekeus, 
chairman of the UN Special Commission, and Hans Blix, director 
general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, submit their 
reports per Paragraph 22 of the aforementioned resolution, 
reports which could help lift the embargo. 
  Rolf Ekeus had informed a REUTER correspondent at the United 
Nations that he would leave for Baghdad early February for 
political talks with Iraqi officials. He added that his talks 
will focus on the overall developments pertaining to the 
dismantlement of the sanctions. 
  In his statement to reporters, French ambassador Merime has 
not denied that there are differences between France and the 
United States over the lifting of the Iraq sanctions. 
  Other diplomatic sources have said that the Spanish 
ambassador stressed, during the UNSC deliberations, the need for 
the UNSC decisions to be guided by Chapter VII of the UN 
Charter, and to be free of any political purposes. These 
sources noted that the Brazilian ambassador was more frank and 
clearer. In his speech, he affirmed that the UNSC and the 
Sanctions Committee must not act in a manner that harms the 
Iraqi people, or hurts their national economy. 
  The Brazilian ambassador affirmed that Paragraph 22 of 
Resolution 687 is clear. He added: The UNSC must be firm in 
the implementation of its own resolutions, a firm implementation 
of which is demanded. Diplomatic sources said that this remark 
by the Brazilian ambassador was meant to reject the addition of 
any fresh conditions to the provisions enshrined in Paragraph 22 
of the aforesaid resolution, which provides for lifting the 
embargo imposed on Iraqi exports, including oil, once Iraq 
implements the provisions 8-13 enshrined in Resolution 687, 
which address the weapons of mass destruction--the provisions 
which have actually been implemented. 
  The PRC ambassador strongly called for lifting the embargo 
imposed on Iraq and ending the Iraqis' suffering. He, along 
with the Russian, Nigerian, and Brazilian ambassadors, called 
for amending the traditional statement issued by the UNSC every 
60 days so that it may note positive developments in the Iraqi 
position. 
  As for the speech delivered by the U.S. representative to 
the 
United Nations, it was a paper she received from Van der Stoel, 
a Netherland national, the so-called Human Rights Commission 
rapporteur, during a meeting they had in the Hague last week. 
This paper included a string of lies and falsehoods that 
characterized the U.S. position. 
  Radio London said that the UNSC consultations reflected 
differences among the UNSC members, adding that the French 
position was strongly favorable to Iraq.

  [Excerpt] Moscow, 19 Jan (INA)--Russian political, 
intellectual, social, and military personalities have stressed 
their absolute support for President Saddam Husayn's brave 
leadership. They described his excellency as a national leader 
of a new type and as the most courageous politician in the world. 
  In statements to an INA correspondent in Moscow, the Russian 
personalities hailed the Iraqi people and their unbending 
steadfastness at the historical battle, the Mother of Battles, 
and their support for their brave leadership. They said that 
the Iraqi leadership stands as a symbol of defiance that will 
continue to be recalled by all free people and all of mankind 
for many generations to come. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party and member of the Russian Federation's 
Parliament, hailed the unique, historic Iraqi leadership. He 
described President Saddam Husayn as a national leader of a new 
type and as the most courageous politician in the world in 
recent times. 
  He said that President Saddam Husayn represents a dauntless 
national leadership that defends the interests of its country 
and people. He said that, from this perspective, Saddam Husayn 
offers a model for how any national leadership should be in a 
world that the United States and hostile Western circles are 
trying to control. 
  He added that a leader who confronted the aggression of 30 
states, led by the United States, deserves to be appreciated and 
respected. He indicated that the Iraqi leadership's wisdom and 
brilliant and successful management of the national economy 
despite the criminal blockade is unmistakable evidence that Iraq 
is a lofty, lively, and deep-rooted country. He said that had 
any other country in the world been subjected to such a 
blockade, it would have died a long time ago. 
  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy stressed that the Liberal Democratic 
Party and the grass-roots Russian masses that supported it in 
the recent parliamentary elections constantly call for lifting 
the blockade imposed on Iraq. He said: We are continuing our 
consultations and efforts in this regard inside and outside the 
Parliament. During my recent European tour, I held numerous 
meetings with leaders of various parties and political and 
social organizations and discussed with them the need to lift 
the embargo against Iraq. He stressed the importance of 
escalating the international campaign to put an end to the crime 
that the United States and the evil powers are committing 
against the steadfast Iraqi people. 
  Gennadiy Zyoganov [name as received], leader of the Russian 
Communist Party and member of the Russian Federation's 
Parliament, called for the resumption of relations between 
Russia and Iraq, proceeding from the deep-rooted relations of 
friendship and cooperation that once existed between the two 
countries. 
  In statements to INA correspondent, he said: Time will not 
erase from the memory of our people years of extensive relations 
of cooperation and mutual benefit. Our people are certain that 
the black clouds darkening the skies of our country will 
disappear and that relations with Iraq will return to normal. 
  He added that the Russian Communist Party is looking forward 
to the day when difficulties are removed and when relations 
between Russia and Iraq are restored to normal for the interest 
of the two peoples and their progress and prosperity. [passage

<F P=106> [Remarks by British MP George Galloway at a meeting between </F>
President Saddam Husayn and a delegation from the Athens 
International Conference on Solidarity With Iraq; in Baghdad on 
18 January -- recorded; in English, with a passage-by-passage 
translation into Arabic] 
  [Text] Your Excellency, Mr. President, I greet you, in the 
name of the many thousands of people in Britain, who stood 
against the tide and opposed the war and aggression against Iraq 
and continued to oppose the war by economic means which is aimed 
to strangle the life out of the great people of Iraq. 
  I greet you, too, in the name of the Palestinian people, 
amongst whom I've just spent two weeks in the occupied 
Palestinian territories. I can honestly tell you that there was 
not a single person to whom I told I was coming to Iraq and 
hoping to meet with yourself who did not wish me to convey their 
heartfelt, fraternal greetings and support. [Arabic translation 
reads: "convey their heartfelt greetings to your excellency and 
to Iraq."] 
  And this was true, especially at the base in the refugee 
camps of Jabalya, and Beach Camp in Gaza, in the Balatah Refugee 
Camp in Nabulus, and on the streets of the towns and villages in 
the occupied lands. 
  I thought the president would appreciate knowing that even 
today, three years after the war [Arabic translation reads: 
"after the aggression"], I still met families who were calling 
their newborn sons Saddam; and that two weeks ago, when I was 
trapped inside the Orient House, which is the Palestinian 
headquarters in al-Quds, with 5,000 [Arabic translation reads: 
"500"] armed mustwatinin [settlers] outside demonstrating, 
pledging to tear down the Palestinian flag from the flagpole, 
the hundreds [Arabic translation reads: "thousands"] of shabab 
[youths] inside the compound, were chanting that they wish to be 
with a DSh K [machine gun] in Baghdad to avenge the eyes of 
Abu-Jihad [Palestinian leader Khalil al-Wazir, killed in 
Tunisia]. And the Youth Club in Silwan, which is the one of the 
most resistant of all the villages around Jerusalem, asked me to 
ask the president's permission if they could enroll him as an 
honorary member of their club and to present him with this flag 
from holy Jerusalem. 
  I wish to say, Sir, that I believe that we are turning the 
tide in Europe, that the scale of the humanitarian disaster, 
which has been imposed upon the Iraqi people, is now becoming 
more and more widely known and accepted. [Arabic translation 
reads: "Sir, I believe I can say that we, in Europe, began to 
turn the tide. The disastrous destruction inflicted on you as a 
result of the aggressive attack to which you were exposed began 
to draw different feelings which are turning in your favor in 
Europe."] 
  Fifty-five British Members of Parliament opposed the war, 
but 
125 [Arabic translation reads: "120"] are demanding the lifting 
of the embargo. 
  And this does not include the invisible section of the 
Conservative Party who must also been moving in that direction. 
And so, Edward Heath is being a very persuasive advocate inside 
his Conservative Party. 
  It is my belief that we must convey the very clear picture, 
that 1994 has to be the year of the ending of the embargo on 
Iraq. Otherwise, famine and all the awful consequences, 
including active despair by Iraqis, will be the result. And 
this is the message we must convey to civilized opinion in 
Europe. 
  So, I salute your courage, your strength, your 
indefatigability. And I want you to know that we are with you. 
Hatta al-nasr, hatta al-nasr, hatta al-quds [Until victory, 
until victory, until Jerusalem]. [applause]

<F P=106> [By Terence White] </F>
  [Text] Kabul, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Afghan factions opposing 
Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani's rule mostly held their 
fire in war-torn Kabul Thursday [20 January], but Defence 
Ministry officials stressed there was yet no ceasefire agreement. 
  Limited small-arms fire was exchanged along the frontline 
and 
pro-Rabbani gunners fired the occasional rocket at rival forces. 
  The lull followed the announcement in Pakistan overnight by 
the anti-Rabbani front that it had decided to observe a 
ceasefire unilterally in response to a proposal from a mediation 
commission of mojahedin commanders. 
  The front linked its decision to what it called "guarantees" 
from the Kabul commanders that its demands, including Rabbani's 
resignation and installation of an interim government, would be 
implemented. 
  The announcement was issued from the northwestern Pakistani 
city of Peshawar by Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e 
Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], on behalf of the 
so-called Supreme Coordination Council of the Islamic Revolution 
of Afghanistan (SCCIRA). 
  The anti-Rabbani alliance threatened to resume fighting to 
deal a "final blow" if the president did not resign. 
  Ex-communist general Abdol Rashid Dostam's Junbish movement 
is part of SCCIRA along with the Hezb-e Eslami, the National 
Islamic Front of Afghanistan (NIFA) of former Afghan president 
Sebghatollah Mojaddedi and some other groups. 
  Defence Ministry officials acknowledged that a 45-man 
delegation of mojahedin commanders from the Kabul area had put 
forward an independent peace proposal. 
  Presidential spokesman Aziz Morad said the state concurs 
with 
the delegation's demands for a ceasefire and the removal of the 
armed groups from the capital but not the resignation of Rabbani. 
  Both Morad and Defence Ministry officials loyal to the 
president's military strongman Ahmad Shah Mas'ud said while 
rapproachement was possible with Hekmatyar, none was possible 
with Dostam. 
  Morad said the state was prepared to negotiate a ceasefire 
with Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami faction, but only on the 
condition that Hezb cut its ties with Dostam. 
  Dostam's forces launched an attack against Rabbani 20 days 
ago but failed to grab key posts in the capital and were pushed 
back to their Bala Hissar and Maranjan Hill strongholds, where 
they have been joined by Hezb-e Eslami. 
  The nearly three weeks of fierce rocket and artillery duels 
left hundreds dead and thousands injured, besides triggering a 
flood of refugees to safer areas. 
  "The state is ready to accept a ceasefire with Hezb, but no 
way with the militia and ex-communists," the presidential 
spokesman said. 
  "The militia must surrender their heavy weapons to the 
state, 
and their lives will be gauranteed, otherwise they will be 
smashed in their posts," Morad said. 
  The declaration of a "Jihad" or holy war against the militia 
is clear evidence that Rabbani is holding firm and will not bow 
to rival demands that he must resign. 
  "The people of Afghanistan are the only ones to decide on 
Rabbani's leadership as they elected him," Morad said, noting 
that as Rabbani, elected for two years in December 1992, he 
still had one year left to run. 
  In the downtown old bazar area of Kabul, which sits at the 
foot of Bala Hissar fortress, hundreds of residents took 
advantage of the de facto ceasefire and the sunny weather to 
flee with their possessions, transported mostly in carts hired 
especially for the job. 
  There was some looting of private houses and shops which had 
been badly damaged in the heavy bombardment between the rival 
factions.

  [Text] Peshawar, Jan 19: A group of 40-member Afghan 
commanders have presented an eight-point peace formula to bring 
an end to the 19 days battle for Kabul with first point 
regarding ceasefire to be effective from January 20. 
  The delegation of commanders, comprising representatives 
from 
each political force of Afghanistan, have initiated their peace 
efforts some two weeks ago to put an end to the ongoing blood 
bath in war battered Kabul. The commanders held a series of 
meetings and parleys with the warring factions, including 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Chief of HIA Golboddin 
Hekmatyar and discussed with them a number of proposals and 
suggestions to thrash out a viable and amicable solution to the 
decade long dispute. After thorough consultation and hectic 
meetings with combatants, the delegation of the commanders 
finally came out with an eight-point peace formula. First point 
being the permanent ceasefire, effective from January 20 from 6 
am immediate stoppage of propaganda against each other. Other 
points included that warring factions would have to leave their 
positions by January 30 by handing it over to the commanders 
from Kabul province and finally, Kabul commanders would be 
responsible for the security of capital. All the combatant 
factions would abide by the peace plan. 
  According to AIP, a four-member delegation led by 
Hash-matullah Mujaddodi has arrived here Wednesday [19 Jan] 
which would hold negotiations with high-ranking officials of the 
Government of Pakistan besides meeting leaders of the Afghan 
political forces. A member of the delegation told AIP, that "we 
will not agree to any proposal or suggestion which do not 
provide assurance regarding resignation of President Rabbani", 
Prof Rabbani's resignation was a must for the maintenance of 
peace and tranquillity in Afghanistan, he said. 
  Other members of the delegation included HIA (Hekmatyar's) 
Abdul Hadi Arghandiwal, Abdul Karim Zarn of Gen Rashid Dostum's 
party and Muhammad Rasul Talib of Hizbe Wahdat. 
  Meanwhile, the Hekmatyar led Supreme Coordination Council of 
the Islamic Revolution of Afghanistan issued a communique 
declaring its stand on the Kabul commanders' Shura. 
  Since the proposal of the Kabul Commanders' Shura is 
guaranteeing the declared demands of the coordination council, 
therefore, "we will observe the required ceasefire from 6.00 am 
in the morning of Thursday January 20. However, it 
(Coordination Council) is anxiously awaiting the implementation 
of the other points of the proposals of the commanders Shura. 
We commend the efforts of the Kabul Commanders' Shura with 
regard to the cessation of hostilities and clashes and the 
establishment of permanent and lasting peace. We are happy that 
the commanders by issuing their proposal have in fact scorned 
the claim for jihad of Rabbani and conversely have verified the 
rightful stand of the coordination Council". 
  The Coordination Council while agreeing to the spirit of the 
proposal of the Commanders Shura, emphasises the completion of 
the Commanders Council in a way which will ensure the 
participation of the Commanders of all parties and sides that 
have presence in Kabul. 
  The Coordination Council once again declares its rightful 
stand as follows: 
  1. That Rabbani has to resign unconditionally. 
  2. The formation of an interim government through a Shura 
representing all parties and sides of the confrontation. 
  3. The evacuation of all armed groups from Kabul. 
  4. Administration and security of Kabul be assigned to the 
commanders Shura. And the commanders Shura be the host of the 
proposed decision making Shura due to be called on February 4, 
1994. 
  5. Holding of elections and the formation of national 
Islamic army.

<F P=106> [Article by Daoud M. Mir, Afghan charge d'affaires in Paris </F>
and minister counsellor: "The Battle for Kabul"] 
  [Text] The battle for Kabul which is now being fought is 
no longer a simple manifestation of struggles among ethnic 
groups or factions: Instead it is an attempt to seize power by 
Babrak Karmal's former Communists and Golboddin Hekmatyar's 
extremists openly supported by Iran, Arab terrorists, and 
extreme nationalist circles in Moscow opposed to President 
Yeltsin. 
  Why this alliance of extremes and against whom is it really 
directed? The coalition which wants to overthrow President 
Rabbani brings together the losers of the end of the Cold War, 
former Communists and fanatics who have taken up the torch of 
the "anti-imperialist" struggle. This coalition is in step with 
the alliance of extreme nationalists and Communists which is 
developing in Russia. Today these extremists, convinced of the 
insurmountable opposition among cultures, tend to smile on 
Islamic radicalism in the Muslim world. 
  What is also new is Iran's direct intervention in Afghan 
affairs. Util now it was Pakistan, supported by private Saudi 
networks, which had tried to impose its favorite in Kabul and we 
condemned it for that. But Pakistani policy has now changed; 
similarly, the Saudi Government has made a clear break with the 
extremists. Unfortunately, these positive gestures did not mark 
the end of foreign interference: Iran openly supports General 
Dostam, former head of the Communist militia, and Golboddin 
Hekmatyar, head of Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], 
who have been shelling Kabul for 18 months, and Babrak Karmal 
who was placed in power by the 1979 Soviet invasion. 
<H5>  Why? </H5>
  But why are the Iranians and the former Communists 
interested 
in Afghanistan? Do they want to turn it into a base for action 
against the moderate Muslim countries and Western interests in 
the world? The armed extremists of the FIS [Islamic Salvation 
Front], who are perpetrating one outrage after another in 
Algeria, were trained in Hekmatyar's camps; it is from these 
same camps that the armed groups now active in Azerbaijan come. 
It was immediately after President Rabbani's visit to Egypt 
that the decision to attempt a coup d'etat against him was made. 
The president was launching a rapprochement with the moderate 
Muslim countries and trying to build a stable, neutral, and 
moderate Afghanistan. After 15 years of jihad against the 
Communists, we do not need to prove our Muslim loyalty and we 
think that dialogue can be established between the Muslim world 
and the West: We are being made to pay for it. 
  Today, the defense forces under the command of Ahmad Shah 
Masud are the last bastion of peace in a tolerant Afghanistan. 
Many commanders from different ethnic groups have mobilized 
their troops to defend the state. So far the Wahdat Shi'ites 
have refused to bow to Iran's orders urging them to join the 
conflict. 
  A victory by the Communist-Islamic coalition would make 
Afghanistan an inviolable base for world terrorism, because who 
would envisage action against Kabul? That would enable Iran to 
pursue its policy of destabilization using others as 
intermediaries. The United States, which supported Hekmatyar 
until the last minute, is now losing interest in Afghanistan. 
But the specter of the Cold War is still there with its 
procession of dead and injured, and its destruction amid the 
snow and cold. We urge the European countries to condemn the 
attempted coup d'etat in Kabul before it is too late.

<F P=106> [By M.K. Dhar] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 10 -- Though the United States and 
India both desire that a meeting between President Clinton and 
Prime Minister Rao is overdue, the expectation here is that the 
initiative for it must come from Washington. 
  U.S. officials, as well as the Indian Ambassador, Mr. S.S. 
Ray, have been talking about a Prime Ministerial visit to 
Washington for many months to strengthen bilateral relations, 
both in the economic and political spheres. The U.S. has to 
suggest the dates for Mr. Rao's visit to enable the officials to 
ascertain his convenience and also do the necessary preparatory 
work. 
  The External Affairs Ministry is keen that the visit should 
take place so that substantive discussions on matters of mutual 
interest can be held at the summit level. But the process can 
start only on receipt of a proper invitation setting out the 
dates. It feels that the policy pronouncements made by the 
State Department's South Asia Bureau need not be taken too 
seriously, particularly when their interpretation keeps changing 
often. 
  But the positive aspects of the relations between the 
world's 
two largest democracies ought to be stressed. The higher-level 
discussions on such issues as nonproliferation, Indo-Pak 
relations, human rights and South Asian security in general is 
overdue. 
  Even though the Clinton Administration's statements on human 
rights in Kashmir have evoked criticism here, the positive 
aspects of Indo-U.S. relations are not being overlooked in the 
face of Washington's repeated assertions about India's stability 
and territorial integrity. It is pointed out that U.S. 
investment in India has increased substantially and further 
expansion of economic cooperation is in the cards. Though the 
embargo on rocket-related technology is still in force, the U.S. 
has been unilaterally raising the technology export threshold, 
and items which India could not obtain earlier from the U.S. are 
now readily available. 
  The U.S. has also sent many positive signals to reinforce 
its 
desire to establish an active and wide-ranging relationship with 
India. Even with regard to Kashmir, the U.S. no longer talks of 
mediation. As the State Department has made it clear, "we do 
not set ourselves in a mediator's role." 
  However, the Indian Government would like the U.S. to take 
note of the extreme sensitivity of public opinion here over the 
Kashmir issue. Almost the entire opposition in Parliament has 
urged the Government to lodge a formal protest over President 
Clinton's letter to the head of Pakistan-sponsored Kashmir 
American Council, Ghulam Nabi Fai, who supports militancy, and 
to underline America's partisan attitude. 
  Even in the face of highly controversial statements 
emanating 
from Washington, Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao has been 
playing it cool as he believes that one need not feel either 
euphoric or frustrated about the ups and downs in Indo-U.S. 
relations. Both sides, he feels, should make a serious 
assessment of their interests and the advantages of not only 
continuing, but also further strengthening this relationship. 
  The last Indo-U.S. dialogue took place in September 1993 
when 
the Foreign Secretary, Mr. J.N. Dixit, visited Washington. The 
subject covered global and regional developments, as well as, 
recent initiatives on issues such as a comprehensive test-ban 
treaty and cut-off of fissile-material production for weapons 
purposes. Other issues of interest also figured and both sides 
reiterated a desire to examine initiatives to enhance security 
through process of confidence-building. 
  Since then the only worthwhile interaction took place when 
Ambassador Ray met U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
The meeting was largely unproductive and did not help to bridge 
the differences between the two countries on various issues. 
India's concern over the move to repeal the Pressler Amendment, 
which would enable resumption of arms aid to Pakistan has been 
duly conveyed to Washington. It has been expressly stated that 
feverish arming of Pakistan would disturb the security balance 
in the sub-continent and force India to spend more on buying 
arms to safeguard its security, at the cost of development. 
  The assertions that the U.S. is not pursuing an activist 
role 
with regard to Kashmir is, in India's view, not borne out by the 
recent policy pronouncements which tend to suggest that 
Indo-U.S. relations may face a prolonged cold spell. 
  According to official sources, the linkage between terrorism 
in Kashmir and Pakistan's clamour over human rights violations, 
supported by the U.S., is a dangerous trend. However much the 
U.S. may desire peaceful relations being established between 
India and Pakistan and resolution of the Kashmir issue, even 
tacit support for terrorist activities in the Valley is likely 
to come in the way of forging closer relationship between India 
and U.S. 
  On the positive side, it is pointed out that India has 
agreed 
to negotiate with Pakistan the Kashmir issue, and offered to 
host the next foreign secretaries' level meeting in four months 
in New Delhi. India is also sending a package of six proposals, 
including on the deployment of forces in the Siachen area, about 
which the U.S. is keen, and additional confidence-building 
measures, to Islamabad in four to six weeks if it is in a mood 
to give serious thought to it. 
  On the non-proliferation issue, the U.S. now understands 
India's reluctance to sign the NPT [Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty] and has agreed to continue the dialogue. India is 
supportive of a comprehensive test-ban treaty and also moves to 
prevent export of weapons-grade fissile material. The 
differences over GATT negotiations have been fully resolved. 
  During the current year Indo-U.S. relations will get high 
priority in India's foreign policy projections. Minus the 
irritants from Washington, New Delhi is keen on strengthening 
Indo-U.S. relations within the framework of shared interests on 
narrowing differences where they exist, and extending 
cooperation in a substantive manner in areas of mutual benefit.

  [Text] The prime minister has stressed on diversification 
by the defense public sector undertakings without, in any way, 
impairing their primary role of serving the country's armed 
forces. Addressing the members of the Parliamentary 
Consultative Committee attached to the Defense Ministry in New 
Delhi, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao said the motivation for 
diversification in defense production units does not mean any 
reduction in defense production, but aims at increasing their 
turnover and exposing them to commercial culture. It was 
disclosed in the meeting that as part of the diversification 
drive during 1993-94, 22 percent of the sales of the ordnance 
factories are expected to be to nondefense customers. 
  The chief of the Army Staff, General B.C. Joshi, informed 
the 
committee of the Army's decision to induct the indigenous main 
battle tank Arjun in its fold. Expressing full faith in the 
capability of the tank, General Joshi said it meets all the 
requirements of the Army.

  [Text] Bangalore -- India will continue to develop its 
nuclear energy programme, especially in the field of fast 
breeder reactors in the overall interest of development and 
improving the quality of life of the citizenry Atomic Energy 
Commission Chairman R. Chidambaram asserted here on Monday [10 
Jan]. 
  Inaugurating a four-week residential course on "An 
integrated 
approach to knowledge, and information" at the National 
Institute of Advanced Studies. Chidambaram pointed out that 
there were many dimensions to nuclear energy, the generation of 
electricity being only one facet of the country's nuclear 
programme. 
  Over the years the spin-off from nuclear research had 
enriched industry, helped medical sciences and boosted 
agriculture. BARC [Bhaba Atomic Research Center] for example 
had played a vital role in the agriculture sector by creating 
new pulse varieties. In Maharashtra farmers who cultivated 
BARC-developed pulse varieties 31000 hectares in 1989 had been 
so impressed with the yield that they increased their sowing 
area to 2,00,000 hectares by 1993. 
  He said nuclear energy would be increasingly used in the 
country in the 21st century as conservationists were up in arms 
against mega hydel projects and the heavily polluting thermal 
projects. 
  Chidambaram pointed out that efforts were on to make use of 
India's vast reserves of thorium which were five times more that 
the uranium reserves. "Our pressurised heavy water reactors use 
uranium, hence work is on to make greater use of thorium. At 
Kakrappa, in Gujara we have made a beginning. But much more 
needs to be done," he said. 
  Chidambaram said that India's safety record in the running 
of 
its nuclear power plants had been very good. "The truth is that 
the dangers of radiation are more pronounced at radiology 
departments and at X-ray units where proper precautions are not 
taken. The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board was studying ways and 
means to reduce the danger posed to patients, he said. 
  Later, participating in the Foundation Day celebration of 
the 
Aeronautical Development Establishment (ADE) he called upon the 
scientists to make use of the synergistic strengths of various 
research organisations across the country to contribute to the 
growth and development of the nation.

  [Text] A military source has said that Israeli warplanes 
carried out an air raid on the al-Na'imah hills at 1430 today 
and that Lebanese Army antiaircraft guns stationed in the area 
confronted them. Our correspondent reports that an Israeli 
plane fired a missile at the headquarters of the Ahmad 
Jibril-led Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine--General Command in the al-Na'imah hills at 1430. The 
extent of the damage is not yet known. 
  Shortly before 1445 today, the Iqlim al-Tuffah hills came 
under artillery bombardment originating from the Israeli 
occupation forces' positions in Sujud, Bi'r Kallab, Mlita, and 
al-Luwayzah. The shelling coincided with raking by large-caliber 
machine guns. 
  A resistance group today carried out a machine-gun and 
rocket 
attack on the Sujud position, where the resistance and the 
occupation forces clashed for 10 minutes.

  [Text] Foreign Ministry Secretary General Zafir al-Hasan 
received from U.S. Ambassador Mark Hambley today an invitation 
for Lebanon to attend the bilateral peace negotiations that will 
be resumed in Washington next week. 
  After the meeting, Hambley announced that the heads of the 
Arab and Israeli delegations will meet on 24 January to make 
preparations for a new round of talks. No specific date for the 
beginning of the talks has yet been set. 
  Hambley noted the positive atmosphere created by the 
U.S.-Syrian summit and said he hopes that progress will be made 
on the Syrian and Lebanese negotiating tracks. 
  In answer to a question, the U.S. ambassador said the 
withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanese territory is one of 
the most important tenets of U.S. policy in Lebanon, which 
endorses the substance of UN Security Council Resolution 425.

in the peace talks are available this time. He expects the 
negotiations to be positive. In answer to a question, he said: 
We can only define our stance in light of the actual 
implementation of all points of agreement.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz, in </F>
Beirut, by Fayiz al-Miliji, in Cairo; date not given; from the 
"Dialogue from Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Miliji] Welcome to our program, minister. 
  [Buwayz] Thank you. 
  [Al-Miliji] Minister, a summit was recently held between 
Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Ilyas al-Hirawi. Would you tell us 
what went on in this summit? 
  [Buwayz] The summit was part of the continued coordination 
between the Lebanese and Syrian leaders. The summit followed on 
the heels of the [al-Asad-Clinton] summit in Geneva and, 
therefore, focused on the outcome of that summit and on a 
possible new approach to dealing with the situation. 
  We have discussed a number of issues brought up at the 
Clinton- al-Asad summit. We have also discussed the future of 
the negotiations that may take place in Washington early next 
month. 
  [Al-Miliji] During their summit did Presidents al-Asad and 
Clinton discuss south Lebanon? 
  [Buwayz] Of course, it seems that the issue of Israeli 
withdrawal from the Lebanese south was discussed in that 
meeting, for it is an integral part of the Arab-Israeli 
negotiations process. 
  There is no doubt that finding the best mechanism for 
achieving an Israeli withdrawal was among the topics discussed 
by Clinton and al-Asad. It seems that the Americans understand 
the need for an Israeli withdrawal as part of the peace process. 
  [Al-Miliji] Would this understanding lead to concrete 
measures? 
  [Buwayz] Of course, this understanding needs a certain 
mechanism to go with it. So far, Israel has not declared its 
intention to withdraw. Once it does so, we believe that the 
mechanism for implementing this withdrawal will be ready for 
discussion. The proposal to form a joint military committee 
without a statement of the goal of this committee, that is 
without a commitment to the principle of withdrawal, does not 
seem very logical to Lebanon. We want to know beforehand what 
the goal of the committee is. If the goal is to monitor the 
situation or contain the current security crisis, there is the 
Armistice Committee and we do not need to set up a new 
committee. If the goal is to disengage the forces, there is a 
multinational force in south Lebanon and, therefore, we do not 
need a new committee. 
  The only good reason for having such a committee is to 
discuss a timetable for Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon. 
  [Al-Miliji] The Lebanese received an invitation to 
participate in the coming round of Arab-Israeli talks. Has 
Lebanon received certain guarantees? Are there certain 
principles that will serve as the basis for the talks? 
  [Buwayz] There are no guarantees in the strict sense of the 
word. The Lebanese head of the negotiating team will go to 
Washington along with a number of the delegation members to hold 
talks with the U.S. side on the mechanism issue, or on the 
approach that will be adopted in this round of talks. Some 
general matters or tendencies have already been formed. 
  [Al-Miliji] What are these general matters or tendencies? 
  [Buwayz] For example, there is a real desire to hold serious 
talks to achieve peace. 
  [Al-Miliji] A desire on whose part? 
  [Buwayz] I think on the part of all sides. 
  [Al-Miliji] Including Israel? 
  [Buwayz] Well, this will be a test for the Israeli position 
and approach. 
  [Al-Miliji] This leads us to another question. What are the 
most important points of disagreement between the Lebanese and 
Israelis, in light of the past 12 rounds of talks? 
  [Buwayz] The main issue is withdrawal. So far, Israel has 
not given us a clear statement on its commitment to a withdrawal 
to the internationally recognized borders. What we keep hearing 
is rhetoric that Israel has no ambitions [on Lebanese soil]. 
Such rhetoric, however, falls short of a clear commitment to 
withdrawal. We want this commitment to be spelled out with a 
clear decision that would open the door to an agreement on the 
details. 
  [Al-Miliji] How about the issue of water? 
  [Buwayz] Concerning the issue of water, there is no room for 
negotiations. Lebanese water is non-negotiable. 
  [Al-Miliji] Concerning the South Lebanese Army, have the 
Lebanese and Israeli sides discussed any arrangements concerning 
the future of this army? 
  [Buwayz] No, we have not arrived at that point yet. I think 
that it is too early to look into this matter. Until a 
commitment is reached concerning the principle of withdrawal, it 
would be premature to discuss such details. 
  [Al-Miliji] President Clinton has met President al-Asad and 
will meet King Husayn. What effect will these negotiations have 
on the Lebanese track of the peace talks? 
  [Buwayz] We believe, and I have said this before, that peace 
should be comprehensive. Any progress on any track, if it 
furthers understanding, is a positive matter. 
  [Al-Miliji] My last question is: Are there any specific 
ideas that Lebanon is presenting ahead of the coming round of 
talks? 
  [Buwayz] Lebanon calls for the return of its land. Lebanon 
is not obliged to present more ideas. Lebanon, I reiterate, 
awaits a clear commitment concerning the principle of 
withdrawal. Once such a commitment is made, everything can be 
resolved. 
  [Al-Miliji] Thank you, minister. 
  [Buwayz] You are welcome.

  [Text] Iran has denounced what it calls Switzerland's 
unfriendly attitude following a series of disputes which have 
soured relations between the two countries. 
  The Iranian ambassador in Bern, Mohammad Reza Alborzi, said 
his Swiss counterpart in Tehran was summoned to the Iranian 
Foreign Ministry on Wednesday [19 January] to explain 
Switzerland's position. 
  The ambassador was speaking after the Swiss Broadcasting 
Corporation suspended a cooperation agreement with Iranian 
Television. The move follows reports that Iranian Television 
was used as a front by people involved in the assassination 
three years ago of a former Iranian prime minister, Shahpur 
Bakhtiyar.

  [Text] Today President Hashemi-Rafsanjani received the news 
editors of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
Stressing the role of the media, especially radio and 
television, in informing and enlightening society and 
maintaining the people's presence and involvement in the fields 
of reconstruction, he said: Broadcasting the facts about our 
Islamic society by the mass media encourages our people and 
instils despair in the enemies and opponents of the Islamic 
revolution. 
  Referring to the negative propaganda of our enemies against 
the Islamic system, the president said: The enemies of the 
Islamic Republic by making use of their propaganda media have 
always tried to portray the ability of the revolution in 
reconstruction and the administration of the affairs of society 
as weak and inadequate. However, the facts of the past few years 
and the important steps which have been taken in reconstruction 
and in the comprehensive development of the country have 
demonstrated that the enemies have been defeated in this battle 
too. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani described the truthfulness, 
reliability, interest, and realism of the media as the reasons 
for winning the trust of the people. Emphasizing the need for 
maintaining and strengthening this important asset, he said: The 
Voice and Vision as the greatest publicity media, through 
necessary vigilance and understanding and timely and correct 
analysis of the special tricks and policies of the enemies, 
should choose the appropriate methods for confronting all this 
hostile propaganda. Thus, while it carries out its mission to 
inform the public it will also establish a close relationship 
with the people. 
  Expressing his satisfaction with the achievements and 
valuable services of the Voice and Vision at different junctures 
of the Islamic revolution, especially its role in maintaining 
the preparedness, steadfastness, enthusiasm, and mobilization of 
society during the period of holy defense [Iran-Iraq war], the 
president said: It is expected that, by making use of all its 
publicity capabilities and facilities and its artistic 
creativity, the Voice and Vision will encourage the people to 
greater participation in the work of reconstruction and will 
reflect the positive results of all their efforts and 
achievements. 
  Referring to the implementation of the government's major 
infrastructural plans in industrial, agricultural, development, 
and cultural fields and the severance of ties of dependence in 
many of those sectors, the president stated: To date, many 
important and basic projects in the country, including the 
construction of the biggest dams, power generators, refineries, 
silos, huge oil and gas platforms, and bridges, the development 
of the communication industries and transportation, the 
provision of gas to towns and villages, the manufacturing of 
petrochemical products, the provision of raw materials for many 
domestic industries, the discovery and exploitation of mines, 
and hundreds of other development projects have been implemented 
by our own committed experts and capable local human resources. 
  He stressed that the mass media, including the Voice and 
Vision, have a major role in reporting these activities to 
society and should make greater efforts in this field. 
  The president referred to the particularly distinguished 
status of the Islamic revolution in the world, and said: 
Historical experiences have proved that safeguarding the 
revolution is much more difficult than the achievement of its 
initial triumph. In Iran the movement of the masses around the 
axis of the leadership of the late imam, and the special virtues 
of our people, not only made victory in military and political 
wars possible, but also put the country on the right economic 
course toward comprehensive growth and development. 
  The president added: Constructive moves by the government in 
economic spheres and success in making up for earlier 
underdevelopment and in repairing the damage caused by the 
imposed war [with Iraq], constitute issues which have forced the 
enemies to revise their attitudes and viewpoints towards the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  According to a report by a Central News Unit correspondent, 
at the beginning of this meeting Mohammad Hashemi, the head of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting organization [IRIB] 
presented a report and announced: At present, in addition to 
broadcasting 40 hours per day of domestic and foreign political, 
cultural, economic, and scientific news, the IRIB has an 
external service which broadcasts across the globe in 19 
different languages. 
  The IRIB head said: Due to possession of an expert workforce 
with an interest in the Islamic system, the IRIB is at present 
in a very good condition, in that it now plays an active role in 
the global information system arena. He then referred to the 
operation of the third television network and the radio news 
station, as well as new efforts underway to make IRIB programs 
more varied. He added: With our current active workforce, we 
are also ready to establish a television news network.

  [Text] This week a two-day seminar devoted to studying the 
development process in Central Asia and the Caucasus was held in 
Tehran, during which regional and international experts from 17 
countries discussed the reasons for and obstacles to development 
in Central Asia and the Caucasus. 
  Qoroqi, one of our political correspondents, has prepared 
the 
following report on the development process in the Central Asian 
republics and the Caucasus: 
  [Begin recording] [Qoroqi] Economic development in the 
republics of Central Asian and the Caucasus cannot be a 
phenomenon that is independent from the multifaceted 
socio-political-security aspects in these countries. The 
obstacles to these republics' development are linked with their 
past. Contrasts between the way the people and the government 
feel about the implementation of economic projects, as well as 
cash-flow shortages are among the main obstacles to development 
in these republics. 
  (Formin), a specialist on regional affairs from Russia 
talked 
about the obstacles to development in Central Asia and Iran's 
role in the development of these countries: 
  [Formin, in English with superimposed translation into 
Persian] Obstacles to the industrial and economic development of 
Central Asian countries are extremely extensive and diverse. 
The most significant of these obstacles is the economic 
instability in these republics and the complete dominance over 
these industries by the Russians. Because of their strong 
dependence on Russia for technological know-how, these countries 
are not able to sever their economic relations with Russia. The 
Islamic Republic of Iran's economic cooperation with these 
countries is of special importance to them because to them Iran 
is like a window to the free world through which they can expand 
their relations with the world. 
  [Qoroqi] Kazem Sajjadpur, a professor at the International 
Relations College, also commented on the same topic and said: 
  [Sajjadpur] Generally speaking, the unspecified nature of 
the 
security situation in these countries on all levels--on the 
individual, national, and regional levels--is the biggest 
obstacle to development. In addition, there is the economic 
element and the fact that their economic systems are extremely 
dependent on Moscow because of the former economic structure, 
which cannot be easily changed. At any rate, we should also 
view matters from a positive perspective too -- there is some 
interest in solving security problems and in moving toward 
development in these areas. In other words, it is not a matter 
of obstacles only. There is also an interest in solving these 
problems. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Turkmenistan Ambassador to Iran </F>
Imangeldi Bayramov by unidentified KEYHAN correspondent in 
Tehran "on the occasion of the visit by the Turkmenistan 
president to Iran"] 
  [Text] [KEYHAN] In view of the visit by Turkmenistan 
President Saparmurad Niyazov to Iran [2 January], what is your 
assessment of this visit and what will the focus of the talks 
between the two countries be? 
  [Bayramov] Relations between Iran and Turkmenistan are 
broadening day by day and this is a source of much pleasure to 
us. As you are aware, last October the president of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, Hashemi-Rafsanjani, visited Turkmenistan and 
the officials of the two countries discussed numerous issues. 
The visit by President Niyazov is a follow-up to the agreements 
reached during that visit and it is being viewed as extremely 
important. President Niyazov is scheduled to visit Esfahan, 
Shiraz, Kish, Gonbad-e Kavus in addition to Tehran. 
  We believe this will be an opportunity for the Turkmen 
President to view the economic issues and capabilities of Iran 
at close quarters and this would benefit both countries. 
  I have just taken over this assignment and now that I am in 
close contact with Iran I feel that the understanding between 
the officials of the two sides is much stronger. In my opinion, 
both countries are keen on the progress of their respective 
countries and nations. The former Soviet Union kept the Iranian 
and Turkmen nations segregated for a long time but after 
independence, the two countries have become closer to one 
another and this is a source of much pride and joy to us. The 
fact that the Iranian officials express their affection for us 
and consider us a friendly fraternal country gives us immense 
happiness. 
  [KEYHAN] What is the level of economic and commercial ties 
between Iran and Turkmenistan? 
  [Bayramov] At present Iran has some centers for the sale of 
its goods in Turkmenistan, which has been warmly welcomed by the 
Turkmen people. These centers will be expanded in the future. 
Of course, we are not going to content ourselves with trade 
only. It has been decided that factories will be jointly set up 
by the two countries in Turkmenistan with Iranian and Turkish 
investment. Products from these factories will be for domestic 
consumption as well as for export by Turkmenistan. 
  The relevant ministers regularly exchange visits and study 
the conditions and feasibility of the projects. For example, 
Turkmenistan has very rich mines that yield construction stones 
and Iran is able to set up factories to polish these stones and 
to prepare them for decorative use. 
  These stones can be used in Turkmenistan and can be valuable 
exports as well. Numerous other factories will be set up in 
Turkmenistan and Iran will provide the technology and machinery 
for these factories. 
  At present the Tejen-Sarakhs railroad is under construction 
and is a joint project. Agreements on other projects are 
expected to be signed between the two sides during the course of 
President Niyazov's visit. In our opinion the agreements of the 
two countries that are on paper are not of consequence but it is 
the follow-up and practical measures that will be implemented. 
  [KEYHAN] In view of the travels of citizens of the two 
countries, what measures have been envisaged by the Turkmenistan 
Government for providing facilities for Iranian passengers? 
  [Bayramov] We respect passengers who come to our country 
with noble ideas and objectives and we believe in providing them 
with all possible facilities. If their objectives can prove 
effective and beneficial for the interests of the two countries, 
such as setting up factories, or for trade and so on, we welcome 
them especially. Our country is still young but wishes to have 
relations with all countries. I stress that if one does not 
interfere in our internal affairs, one is free to travel to our 
country. 
  The majority of the Iranians travelling to Turkmenistan have 
sincere and noble intentions and only come to get acquainted 
with our country and to meet their relatives. Others come to 
set up factories and for business purposes and we welcome them 
wholeheartedly. 
  [KEYHAN] What steps have been taken to abolish visa 
restrictions between the two countries? 
  [Bayramov] Talks are in progress on the subject and visa 
requirements will be waived. 
  [KEYHAN] What is the nature of the relations between 
Turkmenistan and the Western countries? 
  [Bayramov] As I said earlier, Turkmenistan's border is open 
to every country. We will enter no political bloc. We want to 
have reciprocal relations with every country, just as we have 
with Iran. Numerous political and economic delegations regularly 
visit Turkmenistan from France, Germany, Canada, the United 
States, Italy, Argentina, and Japan. We are not a closed 
country. Relations with these countries have led to some 
valuable industrial and economic agreements. We grasp the hand 
of every country that comes to us with noble and pure intentions. 
  [KEYHAN] Have your warm and close relations with Iran 
affected your relations with other countries? 
  [Bayramov] No country has the right to interfere in this 
issue. Similarly, no country can question why we have close 
relations with, say, Iran. This has had no impact on our 
relations with other countries. 
  [KEYHAN] Do you have relations with Saudi Arabia and Israel 
as well? 
  [Bayramov] We have no embassy in Israel. As I stated 
earlier, if a country comes with noble intentions and with plans 
and projects to benefit both sides, we will study them on 
condition that their intentions are sincere and positive. We 
have relations with Saudi Arabia but we have no embassy there 
yet. 
  [KEYHAN] What kind of economic and cultural relations do you 
have with Turkey? 
  [Bayramov] As with Iran, we have cordial fraternal relations 
with Turkey. We have set up factories with Turkey's 
collaboration and we have bilateral commercial relations. Our 
students study at cultural and university centers in Turkey. 
  [KEYHAN] Do you have any particular pattern in mind for the 
political administration of your country? 
  [Bayramov] We copy no country's system. We are independent 
and we have our own distinct national policy. We do not emulate 
the model of any particular country. From every country with 
which we have relations, we adapt things as we see fit to the 
conditions in our country. 
  [KEYHAN] Since Turkmenistan joined organizations such as the 
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and the Caspian Sea 
Organization after becoming independent, how do you see the 
future of such cooperation? 
  [Bayramov] We attach immense importance to regional 
cooperation, especially economically. Such cooperation 
certainly benefits all regional countries. If we can get gas to 
transit through Iran and export it to the world, it will benefit 
everyone, including Iran. If we expand the communication routes 
among regional countries, it would certainly benefit them all. 
If the Turkmen railroad is extended to join Iran's, we can link 
ourselves with Pakistan, Turkey, and Afghanistan. We believe 
that organizations for regional cooperation such as the ECO and 
the Caspian Sea Organization will bring immense benefits to the 
newly independent countries such as Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. 
  [KEYHAN] How are your relations with Russia? To what extent 
has economic and cultural dependence on Moscow been eliminated? 
  [Bayramov] We do not depend on Russia. We have not severed 
our links with it; we have cordial economic and commercial 
relations with all the newly independent countries of the former 
Soviet Union. But we cannot tell Russia what to do and they 
cannot tell us either. It makes no difference to us whether a 
country is big or small. We may feel overwhelmed by larger 
countries in the same way that we feel no sense that smaller 
countries are great. 
  [KEYHAN] What is your opinion of the political adversity in 
Tajikistan? Does it have any fallout effect on your country? 
  [Bayramov] In our opinion, events in Tajikistan are a purely 
internal affair and no country has the right to interfere. We 
believe the Tajiks should solve their problems themselves.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that Syria and 
the Palestinians are the key to achieving peace, whereas Jordan 
is incapable of signing a separate peace agreement. The prime 
minister is currently speaking at the Cinematheque in Tel Aviv. 
Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Segal] The prime minister said that 1994 
will be a watershed. This year will determine whether the 
Middle East is headed toward peace, Rabin asserted. Prime 
Minister Rabin made several important statements here with 
regard to Syria. He revealed that the Americans have reached 
the conclusion that Syria is prepared to make peace according to 
the Egyptian model. Israel hopes to avoid repeating the 
Egyptian precedent, Rabin said, at least with regard to 
withdrawal from territories. 
  [Rabin] This government, on the basis of its election 
platform, is prepared to make a territorial compromise on the 
Golan Heights. Whoever says we lack a mandate to do so is 
simply talking nonsense. It appears in our platform; we said it 
out loud, despite the pain it entailed. I pray that we will be 
able to avoid repeating -- and we will make absolutely every 
possible effort in this regard -- the price we paid for peace 
with Egypt. I would like to say that in this regard, the 
Egyptian precedent -- or the price we paid for peace with Egypt 
-- is on the mind of every Arab leader. I have not still not 
received any definite sign that Syria accepts our definition of 
peace, and it goes without saying that we are far from accepting 
the full and painful price it is demanding in exchange for peace. 
  [Segal] Prime Minister Rabin said that his decisions on 
significant territorial concessions will be made on the basis of 
a national referendum. He refused to define at this time what 
he means by significant concessions. Prime Minister Rabin said 
that at present, he still does not know whether the fundamentals 
of a peace agreement can be worked out with Syria. Once he is 
confident that this is feasible, a law will have be passed on a 
national referendum so that the Israeli public can vote on the 
issue. With regard to Syria, Rabin said that when one refers to 
the Egyptian model of peace one is also speaking about the other 
aspects of that peace or, in other words, peace with 
normalization and security arrangements. 
  Rabin also addressed the Palestinian track and explained 
that 
no progress has been made in the current negotiations with the 
Palestinians. This, Rabin asserted, is because PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat is still demanding the symbols of national 
sovereignty. Rabin reiterated Israel's demands with regard to 
the border crossings and the jurisdiction of the Jericho area. 
Rabin confirmed that agreement has not been reached on either 
the size of the Jericho area or on the issue of the border 
crossings. 
  As for the Gaza Strip, Rabin said that he would feel no 
sense 
of loss if Israel handed the Gaza Strip over to the control of 
the Palestinian police. He also referred to the Gaza Strip in 
the context of Israel's negotiations with Egypt in the 1970's. 
Rabin said he does not remember the Egyptians ever asking for 
the Gaza Strip. 
  [Rabin] I do not remember the Egyptians ever demanding the 
return of the Gaza Strip in the course of the negotiations. I 
can tell you now, and not on the basis of some wild assessment, 
that if we were to offer the Gaza Strip to Egypt today, the 
Egyptians would tell us to go choke on it by ourselves. 
  [Segal] Rabin also alluded to Lebanon and Jordan. With 
regard to Jordan, the prime minister assessed that Amman will 
not sign a separate peace with Israel unless progress is made on 
the Syrian track. This is an important statement in the wake of 
the assessments made by Foreign Minister Peres and Foreign 
Ministry staffers that Jordan could indeed sign a separate peace 
agreement. As for Lebanon, Rabin said that country is obviously 
totally dependent on Syria. Thank God, Rabin said, that no one 
had sought to establish settlements there. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has reiterated his 
disappointment with Syria's position and with remarks made by 
President al-Asad in Geneva. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 20 January, 
adds: "Rabin expected al-Asad to give a warmer expression to his 
desire for peace. The prime minister said he did not want 
President Clinton to answer in al-Asad's place when asked this 
question during the Geneva news conference."] 
  Mr. Rabin said that if we fail to reach an agreement with 
Syria this year the alternative will be political stalemate. 
Rabin made these remarks in a meeting of the Labor Party Bureau 
in Tel Aviv this afternoon. Mr. Rabin noted that Israel may 
agree to a Syrian demand to make progress with it conditional on 
simultaneous progress with Lebanon, but Israel will under no 
circumstances agree to any additional linkage. 
  Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that referring to the 
issue of a referendum, Mr. Rabin said that Hafiz al-Asad must 
convince the Israeli public--just as Egypt's al-Sadat did when 
he came to Jerusalem. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 20 January 
adds: 
"Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres this evening said he does not 
take the reports concerning al-Asad's severe health problems 
seriously. Mr. Peres said this is not the first time such 
reports concerning al-Asad's medical state have been aired, only 
to turn out to be baseless later. This was reported by our 
correspondent Sefi Hendler."]

<F P=106> [Report by the political correspondent in Jerusalem] </F>
  [Excerpt] Political sources in Jerusalem said yesterday 
that President Clinton knew in advance that Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin would decide on a referendum should a withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights be called for. 
  It appears that Rabin divulged this intention to Clinton 
during their last meeting in Washington. Rabin explained to 
Clinton the difficulties he would face in Israel should he have 
to undertake such a task. Therefore, the U.S. Administration 
was not surprised by the announcement on a referendum. 
  Government ministers say they will raise this issue during 
Sunday's cabinet session, because it is inconceivable that Rabin 
should divulge such a move to Clinton while hiding it from the 
government. At the same time, it is believed that at least one 
minister -- Justice Minister David Liba'i, who has already asked 
for information on Swiss referendum laws -- was apprised of the 
plan. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says the 
disagreements between Israel and the PLO lie in the sphere of 
security, including control of border crossings, road security, 
and the size of security areas. Mr. Peres says that to bridge 
these gaps, Israel is prepared to view new proposals, provided 
they are in line with Israel's security concepts. 
  The foreign minister made these remarks to our political 
correspondent Shlomo Raz prior to his departure for Oslo, where 
he will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
PLO head Yasir 'Arafat and attend the funeral of Norwegian 
Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres today addressed 
members of the Labor Party Ef'al circle. Mr. Peres stressed 
that no foreign army will cross the Jordan River, Jerusalem will 
not be divided, and the settlements in Judaea and Samaria will 
not be uprooted. Mr. Peres added, however, that peace with 
Syria cannot be attained without Israeli concessions. 
  Our party affairs correspondent reports Mr. Peres added that 
the Palestinians have nowhere to retreat to, whereas Israel is 
in no hurry and can shift the emphasis to the negotiations on 
Syria.

  [Excerpt] "The PLO thought that we had run out of steam, 
and it started to apply pressure, but we say: We have not run 
out of steam. Even if the negotiations take a few months, we 
will not change our minds. What we are telling the PLO is 
simple: We have put together a very original package for you. 
What we proposed in Oslo contained a territorial element which 
did not come up in the Washington talks. In Washington, 
discussions were held about principles, but principles alone 
cannot bring us to an accord. We are telling the Palestinians: 
We gave you a plan, and you must decide on the timetable. If 
you decide to slow down, we, too, will not be in a hurry. If 
you hurry, we, too, will hurry. For some reason, the 
Palestinians are under the impression that we cannot wait, that 
we have to finish the thing. We are in no rush." These remarks 
were made yesterday by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres during a 
meeting with Labor's Ef'al circle, which convened in Ramat Ef'al. 
  For over an hour, Peres replied to poignant questions posed 
by members of the Ef'al circle, which is seen as a hawkish Labor 
forum. It is headed by Minister Ya'aqov Tzur, and its activities 
are directed by reserves Major General Shay Erez, a former head 
of the Civil Administration in Judaea and Samaria. In reply to 
questions reflecting the circle members' anxieties and 
uncertainty with respect to the arrangement with the PLO and the 
future arrangement with Syria, Peres delivered an optimistic and 
visionary speech about a changing world and a new Middle East. 
"Not only has our region undergone a dramatic change, but the 
changes we anticipate will be even more dramatic than anything 
we have witnessed so far," Peres said. The real enemy 
threatening the Arab world is not Zionist but rather 
fundamentalist. "I do not think Labor's political adversary is 
the Likud; it lies within our midst. We are unable to sever 
ourselves from the past," Peres said, directing his barbs at the 
hawkish Labor forum members who are not entirely at ease with 
the government moves. 
  He maintained that the Gaza Strip arrangement will be 
nothing 
like the one in Judaea and Samaria and that the latter will not 
resemble the arrangement on the Golan Heights. "Netzarim does 
not resemble the 'Etzyon Bloc," Peres said. He added that the 
Sinai precedent does not have to dictate the Judaea and Samaria 
arrangement, because there was no Palestinian rule in Judaea and 
Samaria when Israel conquered the area and because of the 
problem of Jerusalem and the settlements. Peres refrained from 
stating explicitly that the peace arrangement with Syria calls 
for Israel to withdraw from all of the Golan, as his cabinet 
colleagues, Ministers Shulamit Aloni and Yosi Sarid, have said 
and his deputy, Yosi Beilin, has implied. "I see no point in 
starting the negotiations with Syria with offers of concessions 
on the Heights. I do not endorse the Syrian stand, but I do not 
intend to commit myself now to moves on which I may be unable to 
carry through. We are negotiating with Syria, not with 
ourselves," Peres said, stressing that any peace agreement with 
Syria will entail painful concessions. "We will have to choose 
between two conflicting aspirations: the desire to attain a 
peace agreement with Syria and the desire to hold on to all or 
most of the Golan. The question that will have to be answered is 
whether our unwillingness to give up the Golan may not force us 
to give up the peace agreement," Peres said. He did not voice 
his view on the referendum idea, and he was not asked about it. 
  Peres added that before reaching an agreement with Syria, 
the 
government will seek to attain an agreement with Jordan. In his 
opinion, the Gaza-Jericho First agreement will be completed in 
the course of 1994. We will attain peaceful relations (though 
not necessarily a formal peace agreement) with Jordan that will 
include, among other things, regional economic cooperation 
accords on issues such as projects along the Jordan River and in 
the 'Arava. Peres' list of arrangements anticipated in 1994 did 
not include a peace agreement with Syria. 
  The foreign minister attacked Meretz faction members, as 
well 
as Labor figures, "whose hatred for the ultra-Orthodox has 
pushed SHAS [Torah Observing Sephardim] and Agudat Yisra'el to 
the right." In his opinion, the government will have difficulty 
reaching political resolutions without the 
religious-ultra-Orthodox bloc. "I know that I have been accused 
of staging the `foul maneuver' [which toppled the government in 
March 1990], but what the ultra-Orthodox wanted -- education 
budgets -- was their legitimate due. We are not losing the 
religious public because of a budget but because some of us 
radiate contempt and hatred toward them." [passage omitted]

referendum on the Golan Heights would not prevent the government 
from reaching a decision on the issue, nor would it tie the 
government's hands in the negotiations. When asked whether or 
not he was in favor of a national referendum, Peres replied: We 
will decide at the appropriate time. I am not rejecting the 
idea out of hand. The foreign minister was speaking at Bet Berl

  [Text] Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, the head of the 
Israeli delegation to the negotiations with Syria, said that the 
next round of talks scheduled to resume next week would be held 
behind closed doors and far away from the media. Ambassador 
Rabinovich also told reporters in Washington that a national 
referendum would force Syria to take Israeli public opinion into 
account because voters would not support any kind of withdrawal 
unless they were certain of getting real peace in exchange. 
  The message to the Syrians was that they would have to do 
more if they wanted Israeli society and Israel's political 
establishment to meet them half way, Itamar Rabinovich explained.

  [Al-Jundi] The ball is now in the Israeli court, and there 
is 
a proposal from Yitzhaq Rabin to hold a referendum among the 
Israeli people regarding withdrawal from the Golan Heights after 
reaching agreement with the Syrians. Could you inform us about 
the current viewpoint inside the Israeli Knesset and the 
Government? 
  [Darawshah] The summit between al-Asad and Clinton has 
greatly affected the political arena inside Israel, be it in 
government, the Knesset, or among the public. Everyone has 
become occupied with the meeting, especially President al-Asad's 
statements regarding his readiness to realize the peace of the 
brave--one that guarantees a just and comprehensive peace--and 
to fully normalize relations. In other words, full withdrawal 
in return for full peace. This is what the Israeli Government 
demanded previously. It claimed that the extent of an Israeli 
withdrawal corresponds to the depth of peace that Syria 
proposes. Clearly, President al-Asad has presented a wise 
proposal, one that stunned the world and gathered international 
support. But it has also caused some embarrassment to the 
Israeli Government and Yitzhaq Rabin. In the past two days, 
Rabin proposed something that we, as supporters of peace and 
people who want to boost the peace process, reject. Rabin 
proposed holding a popular referendum after agreeing on a draft 
agreement with Syria. In other words, the Syrian negotiators 
will sit at a table with the Israeli negotiators knowing 
beforehand that any agreement they reach must be approved by 
Israeli public opinion, which could change according to the 
prevailing atmosphere. 
  [Al-Jundi] So, this agreement between the government and 
Syria could change if the people reject it? 
  [Darawshah] Rabin stated that the agreement with Syria will 
lead to a big withdrawal from the Golan Heights. He did not 
specify its extent but said there will be a big withdrawal and 
sacrifice. So, such a step requires going back to the people for 
a referendum in which they will express their opinion. I 
believe this is stalling, a postponement, especially when viewed 
together with Israeli reaction to the joint statement and the 
Syrian president's stance, which was dry; it was not 
sufficiently expressive. We hoped Prime Minister Rabin and 
Foreign Minister Peres would have adopted a more flexible 
position showing greater acceptance of the Syrian stance 
announced by President al-Asad during his meeting with President 
Clinton. 
  [Al-Jundi] But some believe Rabin is trying to appease 
Israeli extremists and Jewish settlers in the Golan. 
  [Darawshah] It is, indeed, an attempt to calm the situation. 
But deep down, Rabin realizes that any peace agreement with 
Syria must lead to a full withdrawal of Israeli forces and 
settlers from the Syrian Golan. He knows it. I believe most 
Israelis realize that it is unavoidable. But given the 
opposition to such a step by the rightists, the settlers, the 
Likud, and other right-wing members of the Knesset, Rabin is 
trying to find ways to pacify opponents, such as the referendum 
proposition. But I believe Rabin knows full well that if he 
wants peace with Syria, he must pull out completely from the 
Golan and leave it to its motherland, Syria. 
  [Al-Jundi] Through your contacts with parliamentary blocs in 
the Israeli Knesset, how much support is there for an Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan? 
  [Darawshah] I believe that if the Knesset and the Israeli 
public in general are offered a draft agreement between Syria 
and Israel based on a complete withdrawal of the Israeli forces 
and settlers from the Golan in return for a full 
peace--including the exchange of ambassadors, economic 
cooperation, security arrangements, water agreement, and a 
peaceful strategy--the majority will support it. Rabin 
apparently realizes this but wants to pave the way through the 
referendum idea. 
  [Al-Jundi] I understand from this that for Rabin, it is only 
a matter of time and that the withdrawal will inevitably come. 
  [Darawshah] Rabin is known to be a cautious politician. He 
analyzes positions and moves slowly and gradually. He is doing 
this with the Palestinians now. He did it with the Jordanians. 
With Syria too, he wants to move gradually and prepare the 
public for difficult decisions. For the Israelis, withdrawal 
from the Golan is a difficult decision and Rabin knows it. So, 
he is preparing for this withdrawal through proposals, delays, 
and procrastination. But sooner or later, a full Israeli 
withdrawal from the Syrian Golan and from all occupied Arab 
territories is unavoidable. Rabin realizes that Syria is very 
important if the general Arab-Israeli conflict is to be solved. 
  [Al-Jundi] Thank you. 
  [Darawshah] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Studio report by economic correspondent Gil Tamari followed </F>
by Moti 'Eden video report] 
  [Excerpts] [Tamari] Golan Heights settlers have enjoyed 
massive government investments over the last few years. It 
appears that no harm was done to investments on the Golan 
Heights this year as well. Treasury officials this evening 
confirmed, albeit off the record, that investments will continue 
at the same level as before, although they will not include new 
projects. Our correspondent in the north, Moti 'Eden, reports 
on this issue: 
  [Begin 'Eden recording] The amount of funds to be invested 
on the Golan Heights this year will not fall from that invested 
last year. This includes tourism infrastructure, new factories, 
and the expansion of existing factories. Last year the state 
invested 100 million shekels for development purposes on the 
Golan. This included expanding the Qatzrin industrial zone and 
kibbutzim factories. The industrial output on the Golan in the 
same period was six times higher than the investment, namely 
$200 million. [passage omitted] 
  The government plans to invest the same sum of money which 
was invested last year on the Golan Heights, mainly in industry 
and tourism projects. [passage omitted] 
  Another special budgetary allocation which was not included 
in the 100 million shekels allocated to the Golan last year is 
40 million shekels used by the Construction and Housing Ministry 
for renovating Golan Heights roads. [end recording]

<F P=106> [YEDI'OT AHARONOT public opinion poll conducted by the Dahaf </F>
Institute, directed by Dr. Mina Tzemah] 
  [Excerpt] How would you reply if a referendum was held 
today on the question: "Are you for or against full 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for full peace 
with Syria and appropriate security arrangements?" 
  For -- 37 percent; against -- 61 percent; no reply -- 2 
percent. 
  How would you reply if the referendum question was: "Are you 
for or against partial withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights in exchange for full peace with Syria and appropriate 
security arrangements?" 
  For -- 62 percent; against -- 36 percent; no reply -- 2 
percent. 
  The poll, which was conducted on 19 and 20 January, included 
565 interviewees constituting a representative sample of the 
entire adult Israeli population. 
  An analysis of the connection between voting patterns for 
the 
incumbent Knesset and on the referendum question on 
full withdrawal from the Golan Heights indicates that 
Labor supporters are almost equally divided between support for 
and opposition to full withdrawal. 
  However, the voting patterns of supporters of other parties 
in the Knesset ballot and the poll were obviously comparable, 
with only a minority "crossing the lines": For instance, only 
12 percent of Likud followers support full withdrawal, and only 
14 percent of Meretz followers oppose it. There is a similarly 
significant majority of full withdrawal opponents among the 
supporters of ultra- Orthodox parties (20 percent for withdrawal 
versus 80 percent against among Agudat Yisra'el supporters; 25 
percent for and 75 percent against among SHAS [Torah Observing 
Sephardim] supporters). 
  With the introduction of the question on partial 
withdrawal, the trends change: Only 19 percent of Labor 
supporters are against it versus 80 percent in favor; partial 
withdrawal garners the support of 39 percent of Likud followers, 
some 50 percent of Tzomet and Moledet followers, and 44 percent 
of the National Religious Party followers. 
  The maximum margin of error in this poll is 4 percent.

  [Text] The president, Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, returned 
to Islamabad this evening after a four-day visit to Saudi 
Arabia. Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto received the 
president at the airport. Mr. Asif Ali Zardari and principal 
adviser to the Punjab chief minister Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat 
were also present. During his stay in Saudi Arabia, the 
president performed umrah [minor pilgrimage] and held talks with 
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on a wide range of issues. 
  In an airport statement before his departure from al-Madina 
al-Munawarrah, President Farooq Leghari said that during the 
talks with King Fahd the most important issues which came under 
discussion were recent developments in Indian-occupied Kashmir, 
situation in Afghanistan, and the plight of the Bosnian Muslims. 
He said he apprised King Fahd about the latest developments in 
South Asia and Pakistan's efforts to contain the explosive 
situation in Jammu and Kashmir in the face of brutal repression 
in the valley. 
  He said he also informed King Fahd that Pakistan had 
accepted 
the Indian offer of talks at the foreign secretary's level in 
good faith and hopes that India would engage in a meaningful 
dialogue for resolving Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance 
with the UN Security Council resolutions and the Simla 
Agreement. However, he added, for further dialogue it is 
essential for India to create the right conditions and to desist 
from the policy of repression in the Indian-held Jammu and 
Kashmir. He said he also informed King Fahd that Pakistan had 
accepted the Indian offer of talks at the foreign secretary's 
level in good faith and hoped that India would engage in a 
meaningful dialogue for resolving Kashmir issue in accordance 
with UN Security Council resolutions. [sentence as heard] 
  The president said it is a matter of great satisfaction to 
us 
that King Fahd showed understanding and support for Pakistan's 
point of view on Kashmir, which is based on international 
obligations devolving on both India and Pakistan.

  [Text] Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayeb has 
accepted a mediatory role in resolving the Kashmir dispute as 
proposed by Pakistan. This was stated by Foreign Minister 
Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali while addressing a news conference in 
Islamabad yesterday on his return from a week-long visit to 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The foreign minister 
said he briefed leaders of the three republics on different 
aspects of the Kashmir dispute, especially the grave human 
rights violation in occupied Kashmir. Sardar Asif Ali said he 
discussed the situation arising out of the Afghanistan 
hostilities with the leaders of the three republics. The 
leaders of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan expressed 
grave concern about the Kashmir situation and expressed full 
support for Pakistan's efforts for peace in Afghanistan. 
  The foreign minister said he held detailed talks with these 
leaders on the possibility of connecting road and rail links via 
Afghanistan. He said Uzbekistan has decided to build a road 
from [name indistinct] to Temrez and wants to extend this road 
to Quetta via Herat and Qandahar. Uzbekistan has also decided 
to utilize Pakistan's credit of $30 million and expressed its 
willingness to cooperate in anti-narcotics and anti-smuggling 
measures. Sardar Asif Ali said Pakistan has decided to respond 
positively to Turkmenistan's request for cooperation with 
defense issues. Pakistan has also extended $10 million in 
credit to Kazakhstan, for which Nazarbayev expressed his thanks 
to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

  [Text] Pakistan has handed over two informal papers to the 
Indian high commissioner in Islamabad containing ideas and 
proposals to take measures required for solution of Jammu and 
Kashmir problem and other issues. These papers have also been 
given by the Pakistani high commissioner in New Delhi to the 
Indian foreign secretary. One of the informal papers comprised 
modalities for holding a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir. He 
[as heard] said Pakistan -- with a view to extending informal 
ideas and proposals in developing future useful discussion on 
Jammu and Kashmir problem -- has sent these informal papers to 
India. 
  Replying to a question, the spokesman made it clear that 
giving informal papers does not mean that Pakistan has proposed 
any schedule for next round of Pakistan-India talks.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Al-Shar' Visit Enhances Arab Coordination"] </F>
  [Text] The Syrian foreign minister's visit to Jordan and 
his meeting with Crown Prince Hasan to brief him on the results 
of the al-Asad-Clinton summit is yet another practical, positive 
step toward enhancing and bolstering coordination and 
consultation between the two fraternal countries. 
  This is especially true since this visit comes at a time 
when 
His Majesty King Husayn is scheduled to visit Washington shortly 
and meet with President Clinton. 
  Jordan is satisfied with the results of the Clinton-al-Asad 
summit, especially since the U.S. Administration, as al-Shar' 
said, stresses comprehensive peace that is based on the Madrid 
conference, the resolutions of international legitimacy, and the 
land-for-peace principle. 
  No doubt, His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Washington and 
his meeting with President Clinton will further bolster the 
success of the al-Asad-Clinton summit. King Husayn will talk to 
President Clinton in the name of the cordon states and the Arab 
nation to stress the constant Arab principles and Arab concern 
about a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace on all tracks. 
  It is common knowledge that Jordan has never accepted a 
division of the peace process or the conclusion of a separate 
treaty with Israel. Jordan regards the occupied Syrian, 
Palestinian, and Lebanese territories the same way it regards 
its own occupied territories. Israel should withdraw from all 
of these Arab territories, and the fraternal Palestinian people 
should regain their national rights. 
  The success of the al-Asad-Clinton summit will be enhanced 
and promoted after the Husayn-Clinton meeting, thanks to Arab 
coordination that is founded on credibility and sincere 
intentions that believe in the importance of a unified Arab 
position and insistence on regaining all Arab rights and 
territories on all tracks. 
  Therefore, all the cordon states should adhere to this 
successful, fruitful coordination which is based on mutual 
understanding and conviction to adhere to the resolutions of 
international legitimacy, the land-for-peace principle, and a 
comprehensive solution on all tracks.

  [Text] In activation of the economic agreement they signed 
on 7 January, the Jordanian and Palestinian sides have signed 
another agreement to reinforce and bolster ties of cooperation 
and coordination in the fields of security, territories, and 
borders. 
  This accord, which was signed at the Jordanian Foreign 
Ministry two days ago, acquires great importance, especially 
since it touches on one of the most sensitive issues within the 
framework of relations between countries; that is, the issue of 
security. 
  The Jordanian and Palestinian sides focused their concern on 
bolstering cooperation and coordination to serve the 
distinguished relations between the Jordanians and Palestinians 
at this historical stage in order to achieve the utmost level of 
security and stability for the two peoples. 
  AL-DUSTUR publishes the six points contained in the 
Jordanian-Palestinian agreement on cooperation and 
coordination--which the committee on security, territories, and 
borders that stems from the Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Joint 
Committee reached after two days of continuous meetings. These 
points form the basis for joint coordination between the two 
sides. They are: 
  1. The two sides will exchange information and coordinate on 
the peace negotiations in order to reinforce and unify their 
negotiating stands on the bilateral and multilateral tracks. 
  2. The Jordanians will continue to assist the Palestinians 
to prepare and train cadres and members of the security forces 
in various specializations. 
  3. The two sides will cooperate and exchange information in 
all fields related to the work of the committee in order to 
serve their interests for the higher national interest. 
  4. The two sides will form two subcommittees: one for 
security and borders and the other for territories. They will 
also form any other committee necessary for coordination. 
  5. The two sides will define the appropriate mechanism for 
coordination between them in all fields and provide suitable 
means to achieve this at every stage. 
  6. The two sides will continue efforts to reinforce 
bilateral bonds of trust, brotherhood, and distinctive ties to 
serve their joint interests.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Jordan has asked Iran to 
cut back the number of its diplomatic staff in Amman, the 
newspaper KEYHAN reported Thursday [20 January]. The Foreign 
Ministry, quoted by KEYHAN, confirmed the report but said it had 
not received an official request. The paper said the request 
was made to the Iranian Embassy in the Jordanian capital. 
  A Jordanian diplomat in Tehran, contacted by KEYHAN, refused 
to confirm or deny the report. 
  Tehran broke ties in 1981 after Jordan supported its enemy 
Iraq in the 1980-1988 war. Iran opened its Amman embassy in 
March 1991, three months after the two countries restored 
diplomatic relations.

  [Text] The competent authorities have prevented two leaders 
of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt -- Counselor Muhammad Ma'mun 
al-Hudaybi and Dr. 'Isam al-'Aryan -- from entering Jordan. The 
Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan had invited al-'Aryan and 
al-Hudaybi to visit Jordan. 
  AL-SABIL learned that the authorities did not give any 
convincing reasons for banning these two figures from entering 
the Kingdom. It is known that Counselor al-Hudaybi has visited 
Jordan several times, the last time was four months ago. 
Al-Hudaybi also led a delegation from the Islamic Movement in 
Egypt on a visit to Jordan in 1989 to meet with His Majesty King 
Husayn to congratulate him on the parliamentary elections. 
  Sources in the Islamic Movement in Jordan expressed deep 
regret and surprise at this step, which takes place at a time 
when our country is boasting about the democratic atmosphere and 
the openness prevailing in it. The Islamic sources said that 
there is no explanation for banning these two figures from 
entering Jordan at this particular time, particularly since such 
a measure would tarnish the image of our country whose doors 
have always been open for guests from all sisterly and friendly 
countries.

that a meeting had been scheduled. 
  A spokesman for Prince Hasan said that the Jordanian Embassy 
in Washington informed the rabbis delegation of the meeting 
without obtaining prior clarification from the Jordanian royal 
palace. 
  Meanwhile, the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan issued a 
statement today denouncing the delegation's visit to Jordan.

Faris Buwayz, and Chief Lebanese Negotiator Suhayl Shammas. 
  Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam, Foreign Minister Faruq

affairs, also attended the meeting. 
  People's Assembly Speaker 'Abd-al-Qadir Qaddurah and Prime 
Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi joined the meeting at a later time. 
  The talks dealt with the situation in the region, the peace

Clinton, and the prospects this summit has provided for the 
efforts to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the 
region. 
  The president briefed the Lebanese side on his talks with 
President Clinton on the peace process and the need to advance

  Al-Hirawi, Birri, and al-Hariri expressed great appreciation 
for the efforts President al-Asad exerted at the Geneva summit 
for the sake of a just and comprehensive peace, and to explain 
the principled Arab position that is in harmony with the 
international legitimacy. They also expressed Lebanon's 
thanks--from its president, government, and people--to President 
al-Asad for stressing Lebanon's right to liberate its occupied 
territories, and his call for implementing UN Security Council 
Resolution No. 425, since it is an indispensable basis for peace 
on the Lebanese track. 
  During the meeting, the conferees stressed the importance of 
the continuous cooperation, coordination, and consultation 
between the two fraternal countries during future stages of the 
peace process. The Syrian and Lebanese sides expressed their 
satisfaction with the development of bilateral relations.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Yitzhaq Rabin is once again harping on 
the referendum, stating he will go along with a mere territorial 
compromise in the Golan Heights, and instructing his chief 
delegate to the Washington talks to raise the issue of security 
guarantees. In the meantime, Shim'on Peres, his foreign 
minister, has threatned that unless the Palestinians accede to 
Israel's terms regarding the crossings and control of strategic 
points Israel will give priority to the Syrian track. 
  Thus, instead of responding to the clarion call for peace 
issued by the Geneva summit between al-Asad and Clinton, Israel 
once again embarks on prevarication, procrastination, and 
blackmail, and continues to deal with the Arabs from the 
standpoint of a brute force of occupation that turns up its nose 
to justice and international law and UN resolutions, conducting 
itself as if the Arabs are dying to pick up whatever crumbs of 
their occupied territory it will be prepared to cede. Such an 
attitude once more underscores Israel's determination to swallow 
up Arab territory and conclude separate deals that do not 
approximate the kind of true and dignified peace that the world 
wants and Bill Clinton endorsed at the historic Geneva summit. 
  The referendum in the Golan proposed by Rabin has amazed the 
world and the media, which interpreted it as an open maneuver to 
dodge the goals of a fair and comprehensive peace endorsed by 
the Geneva summit and full implementation of UN Security 
resolutions and the land-for-peace formula without prevarication 
or trickery. The Golan is occupied Syrian territory and the 
proposed referendum is an open transgression of international 
law and the Geneva Conventions and UN resolutions. An occupying 
power has no business holding a referendum on the fate of 
territory it cannot rightly claim. There are 100,000 displaced 
Syrian nationals waiting for peace to come so they can return to 
their homes. Rabin's proposal has surprised a world convinced 
that short of the entire Golan being handed back to Syria, 
Middle East peace remains an impossibility. The entire world 
community has acknowledged that without Syria, which holds the 
key to peace, peace in the region stands no chance. It is now 
obvious that the idea of Rabin's maneuver is to disrupt the 
peace process. By instructing his chief delegate to the 
Washington talks to raise Israel's security concerns, Rabin 
sends the ominous message that his government is working to 
derail the upcoming talks and take things back to the point 
where they stood before the Geneva summit. Israel is known to 
resort to security pretexts every time the prospect that the 
peace process may move forward appears on the horizon. This, 
when it goes without saying that no security guarantees should 
have precedence over peace itself. Syria has stated, through 
President al-Asad, that it is willing to conclude peace and set 
up normal relations in the region. Indeed, Syria, also through 
President al-Asad, has made a strong appeal for peace and urged 
the Israeli leaders to display courage and cast off the practice 
of prevarication and procrastination. All of which raises 
legitimate questions about Israel's peace credentials and 
strengthens a conviction that Israel's claims are nothing more 
than a temporary tactic to absorb the ire of an international 
community annoyed by a ceaseless Jewish settlement activity in 
the occupied land. The Oslo agreement example only goes to 
prove our point. Israel is still blackmailing the Palestinians 
and out to play the Arab parties off one against another. 
  Syria wants the kind of just, comprehensive, and dignifying 
peace on all the fronts that removes occupation and restores 
Arab rights. For Syria, there is nothing to choose between the 
Golan Heights and the West Bank, or any other occupied Arab 
territory, for that matter. Syria is not about to play Israel's 
games, nor will it give in to its blackmail. Against the 
background of the Geneva summit, Syria believes that the need 
has never been more pressing for the United Sates and the world 
community to get Israel to climb on the bandwagon of a fair and 
comprehensive peace.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "The New Israeli Maneuver," 
TISHRIN writes: The secrets behind the Israeli proposal, which 
carries the fingerprints of Yitzhaq Rabin, to hold a plebiscite 
on the future of the Golan Heights are gradually coming to 
light. The proposal aims at allowing Israel to usurp part of 
the Golan Heights. This is totally rejected by Syria. 
  The paper explains that Syria though President al-Asad 
before 
and during the [Geneva] summit stressed that the Golan Heights 
will never be a subject of bargaining and that peace hinges on 
the return of the entire Syrian territory. 
  The paper stresses that Syria is not at all interested in 
the 
plebiscite and that the Israelis have no right to hold a 
plebiscite in an occupied Syrian territory. Such a measure 
marks a flagrant encroachment on international law and the 
charters and resolutions of the United Nations. Israel also has 
no right to use the law of the jungle to annul the facts of 
history and geography and the principles of international law. 
Regardless of how long it lasts, occupation will never annul 
Syria's sovereignty over its territory and the identity of the 
Golan Heights. 
  The paper explains that Israel is resorting to further 
intransigence and maneuvering by proposing the plebiscite. The 
paper notes that the Golan Heights belong to the Syrian people 
and not to the Zionist settlers. They are an inseparable part 
of Syria and, in all cases, the Golan Heights are not 
negotiable, and not a single Syrian will accept to relinquish an 
inch of them. 
  TISHRIN concludes by saying: The world welcomed the outcome 
of the Geneva summit and agreed on the positive, constructive 
Syrian role and Syria's complete response to the requirements of 
peace. Israel, in the meantime, is working on sabotaging what 
was achieved and at hindering the efforts in order to return the 
region to despair and bitterness. Only Israel should be blamed 
for this.

  [Text] The president, Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari, returned 
to Islamabad this evening after a four-day visit to Saudi 
Arabia. Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto received the 
president at the airport. Mr. Asif Ali Zardari and principal 
adviser to the Punjab chief minister Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat 
were also present. During his stay in Saudi Arabia, the 
president performed umrah [minor pilgrimage] and held talks with 
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on a wide range of issues. 
  In an airport statement before his departure from al-Madina 
al-Munawarrah, President Farooq Leghari said that during the 
talks with King Fahd the most important issues which came under 
discussion were recent developments in Indian-occupied Kashmir, 
situation in Afghanistan, and the plight of the Bosnian Muslims. 
He said he apprised King Fahd about the latest developments in 
South Asia and Pakistan's efforts to contain the explosive 
situation in Jammu and Kashmir in the face of brutal repression 
in the valley. 
  He said he also informed King Fahd that Pakistan had 
accepted 
the Indian offer of talks at the foreign secretary's level in 
good faith and hopes that India would engage in a meaningful 
dialogue for resolving Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance 
with the UN Security Council resolutions and the Simla 
Agreement. However, he added, for further dialogue it is 
essential for India to create the right conditions and to desist 
from the policy of repression in the Indian-held Jammu and 
Kashmir. He said he also informed King Fahd that Pakistan had 
accepted the Indian offer of talks at the foreign secretary's 
level in good faith and hoped that India would engage in a 
meaningful dialogue for resolving Kashmir issue in accordance 
with UN Security Council resolutions. [sentence as heard] 
  The president said it is a matter of great satisfaction to 
us 
that King Fahd showed understanding and support for Pakistan's 
point of view on Kashmir, which is based on international 
obligations devolving on both India and Pakistan.

  [Text] Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayeb has 
accepted a mediatory role in resolving the Kashmir dispute as 
proposed by Pakistan. This was stated by Foreign Minister 
Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali while addressing a news conference in 
Islamabad yesterday on his return from a week-long visit to 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The foreign minister 
said he briefed leaders of the three republics on different 
aspects of the Kashmir dispute, especially the grave human 
rights violation in occupied Kashmir. Sardar Asif Ali said he 
discussed the situation arising out of the Afghanistan 
hostilities with the leaders of the three republics. The 
leaders of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan expressed 
grave concern about the Kashmir situation and expressed full 
support for Pakistan's efforts for peace in Afghanistan. 
  The foreign minister said he held detailed talks with these 
leaders on the possibility of connecting road and rail links via 
Afghanistan. He said Uzbekistan has decided to build a road 
from [name indistinct] to Temrez and wants to extend this road 
to Quetta via Herat and Qandahar. Uzbekistan has also decided 
to utilize Pakistan's credit of $30 million and expressed its 
willingness to cooperate in anti-narcotics and anti-smuggling 
measures. Sardar Asif Ali said Pakistan has decided to respond 
positively to Turkmenistan's request for cooperation with 
defense issues. Pakistan has also extended $10 million in 
credit to Kazakhstan, for which Nazarbayev expressed his thanks 
to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Proposal To Deploy UN Forces Along the </F>
Line of Control"] 
  [Text] Citing Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan, 
the Indian English daily THE HINDU writes that Pakistan has 
expressed cautious reaction over an Indian proposal to convert 
the Line of Control [LOC] in Jammu and Kashmir into a line of 
peace and tranquility and has given the impression that Pakistan 
will be glad to hold direct talks, if this proposal reflects 
India's intention to reduce the forces deployed on the LOC. 
But, if India wants Pakistan to accept the current situation in 
Kashmir as it is, Pakistan is not ready for it. 
  Whenever India accuses Pakistan of interfering in occupied 
Kashmir, Pakistan puts up a proposal to have the LOC under U.N. 
supervision. But, India does not accept it. India also does 
not want the representatives of human rights organizations to 
visit occupied Kashmir and see for themselves the human rights 
violations there. Pakistan has positively responded to every 
positive proposal and will continue to do so. India should have 
the moral courage within itself to accept the proposal to let 
the LOC be supervised by the U.N. forces or the member countries 
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. 
Pakistan is also ready to consider the reduction of forces 
along the LOC.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Khayrallah </F>
Khayrallah in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] [Khayrallah] What is your opinion of what took 
place in Geneva between President Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton? 
  ['Arafat] Actually I followed what happened, and I express 
my strong satisfaction with what has been achieved and consider 
it complementary to what has been achieved on the Palestinian 
and Jordanian track. It is now the Lebanese track's turn after 
the Syrian track, God willing. Because we aspire to a 
comprehensive Arab solution that takes account of our Arab 
nation's interests to establish a just and comprehensive peace 
in the region. 
  [Khayrallah] Your position sounds very positive with regard 
to what has happened. So how would you assess what President 
Clinton said in that meeting? 
  ['Arafat] What he said emphasized the importance of what 
happened on the Palestinian-Israeli track and the Washington 
agreement between Israel and the PLO in order to reach the 
declaration of principles agreement we signed. What President 
Clinton said is a new driving force for the current peace 
process in the region. 
  [Khayrallah] What about what President al-Asad said and his 
focus on a comprehensive peace? 
  ['Arafat] That is not the demand of Syria only. I mention 
President al-Asad because he stressed a comprehensive peace, 
which is the demand of the Arab nation as a whole. It is a 
Palestinian, Jordanian, Egyptian, Syrian, Lebanese, and Arab 
demand. 
  [Khayrallah] It is now four months since the Gaza-Jericho 
First agreement was signed in Washington. How would you assess 
the course that began after the White House ceremony? 
  ['Arafat] Regrettably, the Israeli side continues to try to 
get around what was agreed upon. I hope that the conference's 
cosponsors, who signed the agreement with us, will hasten to 
intervene to force Israel to implement precisely and honestly 
what was agreed, including compliance with the dates stipulated 
in the agreement. Israeli maneuvers are continuing, in order to 
evade the dates and try to win as much support as possible for 
the Israeli view with regard to the implementation of the 
agreement. This is expected from the Israeli side and came as 
no surprise to us. We know how to run the negotiations with the 
Israelis. We know the nature of the negotiations; they are not 
easy. We always try to urge them to comply precisely and 
honestly with what was agreed. But regrettably, the Israeli 
maneuvers are still continuing. 
  In this context we are not begging from Israel, but, rather, 
demanding an implementation that serves peace and its march. 
Peace is in the interests of all: us, them, and the region as 
a whole. This is the comprehensive peace we are talking about as 
an Arab nation. 
  [Khayrallah] There is an Israeli view that President 'Arafat 
is not convinced that what the two sides have reached so far is 
an agreement on a transitional, not final, phase, and that you 
want to begin the final phase now. 
  ['Arafat] Any Israeli official who says that seems not to 
have read the agreement. The agreement specified phases for 
that; it is a phased agreement. As for Gaza and Jericho, the 
Israeli withdrawal from there means that they will become a 
liberated territory in the legal and international sense. And 
if some Israeli officials know this fact, let them refer to 
international law and international stipulations to see what 
withdrawal means. 
  The withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho means that this 
territory becomes liberated the minute the (Israeli) withdrawal 
begins, just as happened when the French withdrew from Lebanon 
and Syria, the British from India and Egypt, and the French from 
Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. But, as we agreed, the 
implementation will be in stages. For example, the withdrawal 
from the densely populated areas in the other parts of the West 
Bank will take place before the elections. This is because the 
elections should be conducted under international supervision 
and under the Palestinian National Authority's supervision. We 
will set up a national authority in Gaza and Jericho which will 
extend to all Palestinian territories. 
  [Khayrallah] That is in the context of the negotiations.... 
  ['Arafat] No, in the context of reality...only in the first 
stage this authority is not entitled to set up an army or to 
have embassies. But when the PLO signed--and (Israeli Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin signed with the PLO, which has a bigger 
international recognition than Israel. [as published] 
  [Khayrallah] But if we want to determine what the 
disagreement is and take the crossings issue for example, what 
are the points of disagreement? 
  ['Arafat] Are we going to live in Bantustans or ghettos? No. 
When we say "withdrawal," it means complete withdrawal. They 
are using security as an excuse. Assuming you do not trust the 
Palestinian policeman or officer standing at the crossing point, 
do you also not trust the international presence? We too do not 
trust the Israeli soldier. In Sinai they trust the 
international presence. The Likud party trusted the 
international presence there. So there is at least a precedent 
for him [Rabin] to rely on, namely the Likud's agreement to the 
international presence in Sinai. What different does it make 
for the international forces in Sinai to expand to the finger, 
or [Gaza] Strip -- the strip resembles a toe on the map with 
regard to Sinai, which is why they call it the Gaza Strip. 
  [Khayrallah] So how do you believe that can be resolved? 
  ['Arafat] We are following up the matter. We also urge the 
cosponsors of the conference and the international parties to 
participate in persuading the Israelis to understand this matter. 
  [Khayrallah] Are you satisfied with Israel's request that 
there be a ceiling of 7,000 Palestinian policemen? 
  ['Arafat] There is no Israeli demand to that effect. On the 
contrary, they are aware of the importance of the police. In the 
developed states there is a policeman for every 200-250 
citizens. As for Third World countries, there is one policeman 
for every 100-150 people. But this applies to states that have 
armies which they can use at any moment. We Palestinians are not 
allowed in the first stage to have an army. So we will rely 
mainly on the police. The number agreed in the security 
committee ranges between 20,000 and 25,000 policeman. 
  They say that they have no objection to the number we 
specified. Our talks with World Bank (officials) and the recent 
meeting in Oslo with the donor states and the World Bank showed 
that the first group in Gaza and Jericho only should be 12,000 
to 15,000 policemen, and the other groups are to be sent when 
the withdrawal from the other Palestinian territories has been 
completed. 
  [Khayrallah] In view of that, do you expect progress to be 
achieved in the near future, based on compromises with regard to 
the crossings, for example? 
  ['Arafat] We hope so. But not compromises, but, rather, 
solutions that give us our rights in full. 
  [Khayrallah] But at what stage? 
  ['Arafat] The negotiations are continuing in Taba. 
Negotiations were held this month in Oslo, Paris, and Cairo, and 
now are being held in Taba. 
  [Khayrallah] Why were the economic negotiations in Paris 
suspended? 
  ['Arafat] Because politics comes before economics. There 
must be an agreement on political matters in order for economic 
negotiations to progress. 
  [Khayrallah] The negotiations are continuing now. Are you 
satisfied with the Palestinian delegation's performance? 
  ['Arafat] Yes. The Palestinian delegation is implementing 
its leadership's instructions. So we are satisfied. 
  [Khayrallah] Completely satisfied? 
  ['Arafat] Of course. The delegation takes account of the 
Palestinian people's interests. 
  [Khayrallah] Do you believe that better elements could be 
used in the negotiations? 
  ['Arafat] If necessary, we will send [other] elements. And, 
praise God, we have sufficient competent and capable cadres. 
  [Khayrallah] How do you explain Palestinian differences? 
  ['Arafat] What differences? 
  [Khayrallah] Among Palestinian leaderships.... 
  ['Arafat] There are no differences. But Palestinian 
democracy is strong, which means.... Differences exist in 
Israel. And in the United States there are differences over 
NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] (the economic 
agreement among the United States, Canada, and Mexico). And in 
Europe there are those who are for GATT and those who are 
against. It is one of the characteristics of any democratic 
arena. We are proud of Palestinian democracy, even if it does 
not appeal to some people. We are exercising it to serve the 
Palestinian people. 
  [Khayrallah] How do you explain the press campaigns against 
you these days? 
  ['Arafat] They are incited. They reflect -- whether in the 
Arab or foreign press -- their surprise at the resoluteness of 
the Palestinian position. But there is a Palestinian proverb 
which says, "the wind cannot shake a mountain." 
  [Khayrallah] Let us move to the Jordan issue. What is the 
status of relations with Jordan at present? 
  ['Arafat] Relations are "fine," and we have signed a very 
good economic agreement with the Jordanian brothers, and the 
joint committee has begun its work. We are proud of 
Palestinian-Jordanian relations. 
  [Khayrallah] But what was the reason for the delay in 
signing 
the agreement? 
  ['Arafat] We had to wait for what was going to happen 
between us and the Israelis. 
  [Khayrallah] So relations with Israel are not given 
precedence over relations with Jordan? 
  ['Arafat] That is impossible. And an agreement will be 
signed between us and the brothers in Egypt; you were the first 
to read the "draft agreement on economic and technological 
cooperation between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the PLO." It 
will, God willing, be signed this month, because we are seeking 
protection through Arab economic relations against Israeli 
infiltration among the Palestinian people, who have been under 
the occupation for many years. 
  [Khayrallah] So you do not in any way give precedence to 
relations with Israel over relations with any Arab party? 
  ['Arafat] It is not possible, because our Arab relations are 
fundamental. 
  [Khayrallah] But how do you explain your request to set up a 
Palestinian central bank or to have a Palestinian currency? 
  ['Arafat] We are entitled to demand everything the next 
Palestinian entity should have. We are on our way to a state 
which is supposed to unite confederally with Jordan, in 
accordance with the resolution adopted by our National Council 
and the two fraternal peoples' free choice. If our brothers in 
Jordan agree, we will establish the confederation with them 
immediately. The state to be established, God willing, should 
have all these capabilities. 
  [Khayrallah] When do you expect to reach Gaza or Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] We hope that Israeli intransigence will end. The 
Israelis should understand that, if the central issue in the 
Middle East and the Arab nation, that is the Palestinian issue, 
is not resolved, there will be no stability, security, or peace, 
but rather, total chaos. So they should take account of the 
importance of resolving this issue. 
  [Khayrallah] But how? What is your advice to them? 
  ['Arafat] The agreement signed was not between us and Israel 
only. The world took part in it and it was signed by the U.S. 
and Russian cosponsors of the conference, under the U.S. 
President's auspices and before the eyes of the entire world, 
which blesses it. 
  [Khayrallah] What are you actually requesting Israel to do? 
  ['Arafat] To implement honestly and precisely what has been 
agreed. 
  [Khayrallah] Do you believe that Israel has not read the 
agreement well? 
  ['Arafat] No, it has read it well, but it is trying to 
maneuver and evade the substance of the agreement. 
  [Khayrallah] What would you say about relations with 
Rabin? How do you find the man? 
  ['Arafat] I say that military men honor their word, and I 
hope this will apply to the implementation of the agreement. 
  [Khayrallah] What was the status of the talks with him, 
given it is the first time you have met with an Israeli prime 
minister? 
  ['Arafat] They were not easy. The first meeting was 
difficult. But after that we moved to lay new foundations to 
implement the agreement, and when he requested the postponement 
of the withdrawal, I agreed. 
  [Khayrallah] What attracted you in his personality? 
  ['Arafat] He honors his word. 
  [Khayrallah] What about Shim'on Peres? 
  ['Arafat] He is an experienced politician. 
  [Khayrallah] What is the difference between him and Rabin? 
  ['Arafat] I do not interfere in the Israeli Government's 
private affairs. 
  [Khayrallah] Yasir 'Arafat is accused of wanting to control 
everything, as though the stage can accommodate one person only. 
What is your opinion? 
  ['Arafat] You know, building a homeland requires a man who 
works day and night. It is now 0115 hrs, and the work has just 
started. By God, if a child is wounded in the intifadah, I am 
responsible for him, and.... I would like to remind you of the 
committees we have set up to tackle the new situation with 
regard to building the Palestinian national authority. These 
committees have been formed at all levels. For example, the 
economic committee follows up matters with the donors and the 
World Bank. We have also started to set up establishments like 
the human rights committee as well as the environment, census, 
health, education, and housing establishments. 
  [Khayrallah] How do you view Arab relations in general? 
  ['Arafat] By God, they need further efforts from Arab 
leaders to restore Arab cohesion, because we are facing a new 
order and it will be to our cost if we do not confront it 
united. I call for further Arab unity in the interests of our 
children and posterity. 
  [Khayrallah] Can you make an initiative in this connection? 
  ['Arafat] I support the Arab League secretary general's 
initiative. 
  [Khayrallah] What about Palestinian national unity and 
[Palestinian] opposition organizations? 
  ['Arafat] I tell them one thing. Now that an understanding 
has been reached between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton and 
signs of a solution have begun to emerge on the Syrian front, I 
tell these organizations: My hand is extended to you in order 
to build the Palestinian National Authority and a free homeland 
for all the free people of Palestine -- a democratic, civilized, 
contemporary homeland based on the principles, values, ethics, 
and religious radiation derived from Palestine's traditions and 
civilization and the religious tolerance for which this land -- 
the land of Palestine, the land of peace, the land of sanctity 
-- is known. I extend my hand to you all in order to reinforce 
our national unity, because Palestine is being reborn, and 
Palestine needs all its women and children. 
  [Khayrallah] How many hours do you work a day? 
  ['Arafat] Between 17 and 18 hours, as usual. 
  [Khayrallah] Are there any more visits coming up? 
  ['Arafat] A visit to Egypt and a meeting with President 
Mubarak on Thursday, and a meeting with U.S. Secretary of 
Commerce Brown. Then I will go to Oslo to take part in the 
funeral of Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst, an old friend of 
mine since he was defense minister. He used to visit southern 
Lebanon to inspect his country's unit there.

  [Text] Amman (Petra)--The Fourth Islamic-Christian Dialogue 
opened in Amman Tuesday [18 January] with a call from Jordan on 
scholars and laymen alike to safeguard religion as a source of 
justice and good deeds. 
  "We have a duty to isolate religion from and keep it safe 
against political upheavals, whims and changes so that the 
people will not lose confidence in their faith or suspect 
religious teachings," said Nasir-al-Din al-Asad, president of 
the Royal Academy for Islamic Civilisation Research (Al al-Bayt 
Foundation). 
  Deputising for His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the 
Regent, at the opening of the three-day meeting, Dr. al-Asad 
said Muslim scholars and the heads of the Christian faith have 
contributed towards bringing closer together the views of the 
two sides and achieving better understanding between them. 
  It is hoped that these dialogues in which many senior 
personalities from the two faiths and their societies 
participate would help scrutinise those issues that have 
remained outstanding and unclear and open the way for a better 
comprehension of the principles on which the two religions are 
based, said Dr. al-Asad. 
  Commenting on Jordan's endeavours to protect the holy places 
in Jerusalem under the Hashemite rule, Dr. al-Asad referred in 
particular to the recent royal decree for the formation of a 
commission to handle the affairs of the holy city, grouping 
Christian and Muslim individuals. 
  He noted that the present dialogue is dedicated to 
discussing 
religions' stand vis-a-vis nationalities, adding that religions 
do not conflict with nationalistic feelings, but rather advocate 
ending extremism, ethnic differences and other forms of 
conflicts. 
  Cardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Vatican Council on 
Promoting Relations with other faiths, who is attending the 
meetings, told the first session that Christianity does not 
oppose positive nationalities which do not oppose the law of 
God. Christianity, he said, rather opposes those feelings of 
superiority over other ethnic groups because such feelings 
transform nationality into oppressive movements that work 
against man and God. 
  A total of 65 scholars are participating in the discussions 
held at the King 'Abdallah Mosque in Amman. 
  They are all scholars from Jordan, Palestine, Iraq, Bosnia, 
Turkey, Senegal, Sudan, Morocco, Syria, Lebanon, the United 
Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia, Spain, Nigeria and France.

<F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok and On Levi] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israel is demanding in the Taba talks the 
setting up of a security belt around the Qatif Bloc settlements, 
which would increase the territory to be left under its control 
to 46 square kms. The Palestinians agree to Israeli control 
over an area of 19 to 20 square kms. It was finally agreed 
yesterday that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres will meet in Oslo on Saturday in a further attempt 
to break the deadlock in the Taba talks. 
  It was learned yesterday that contrary to announcements by 
Israeli spokesmen there is a sharp dispute between Israel and 
the Palestinians on the size of the Israeli autonomy area in the 
Qatif Bloc. Israel is demanding that in addition to the 
territories of the settlements and the areas in between them, it 
will have control of a security belt that would "wrap" the 
settlements from outside. Israel is demanding overall 46 square 
kms. The Palestinians are opposed to this and are agreeing to 
leaving some 19 to 20 square kms with Israel. [passage omitted] 
  The Security Committee in the Taba talks has still not found 
a compromise formula for control of the border crossings. Some 
progress was made in the Civilian Affairs Committee, headed by 
Brigadier General Gadi Zohar. It was decided to set up a single 
dialing area for the autonomy and to frank a Palestinian stamp. 
  Senior sources in the Israeli delegation said last night 
that 
"there would be no Israeli compromise on the crossings issue. 
Israel went a long way toward the Palestinians on that issue and 
we now expect them to show flexibility." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Text" of address by President Saddam Husayn to a </F>
delegation from the Athens International Conference on 
Solidarity With Iraq during a meeting held in Baghdad on 18 
January] 
  [Text] I am pleased to meet you all, starting with the 
general who heads the delegation, as well as every member of the 
delegation. 
  I greet you on behalf of the Iraqi people. I also value your 
stand and thank you for the difficulties you endured during the 
long journey, especially since you had to come by car most of 
the way as a result of, as you know, the air embargo imposed on 
our country. 
  I am sure that all the Iraqi people are well aware of what 
your stand means. As you also know, one loses many loved ones, 
particularly if one is an official and not an ordinary citizen. 
We have lost many loved ones but at the same time we have won 
many friends. We have won you as well as others who have truly 
understood the nature of our stand and why the conflict had 
taken place. 
  We have lost many beloved ones. However, the experience 
enabled us to expose some false friends who used to speak about 
friendship before the war. The experience also enabled us to 
expose on a large scale many of the enemies as their enmity was 
not based on a worthy cause and did not stem from a just stand. 
  I am certain that you know, as I know, many of the details 
concerning the real state of affairs. That's why I will not 
burden you with a review of the details of what you already 
know, or what you could come to know. But I believe it is my 
duty and it is your right that I contribute as best as I can to 
entrenching the basic pillars of your concept on how to combat 
injustice. 
  Some of those who spoke a few moments ago said that they 
are trying to convince the public opinion in their countries to 
remove the injustice done to the Iraqi people. Although they 
have made large strides when compared with where they started, 
they believe they still have much to do to make the public 
opinion in their countries understand the situation as they 
themselves understand it. 
  I would like here to comment and say that your work is of 
the 
constructive type. It achieves advancement. Therefore, do not 
expect to gain much at the beginning. The major calls and 
missions, including the prophets' missions to communicate God's 
message to mankind started with a small group, then spread to 
millions, as you know. One of the male or female speakers has 
said that the public opinion in Europe has started to comprehend 
and has started to become aware of part of the deception 
practised against it at the beginning of the incidents, not to 
mention the injustice that has befallen Iraq as a result of the 
aggresion. 
  I would like to say the following on this issue: We rejoice 
at these positive manifestations you spoke about. However, what 
is more important is that the European public opinion not be 
deceived once again. If the European and world public opinion 
is no longer deceived as it had been deceived by the false U.S. 
claims and the claims of the Kuwaiti rulers who oppress the 
Kuwaiti people, if the real cause which led to the deception is 
known, and if this cause is remedied, then we will all be 
satisfied because the blood of the Iraqis would have achieved an 
important gain on the human level in terms of making the truth 
known to all and exposing the evildoers without their being able 
to deceive others for a long period of time. 
  In any case, what is important is that we pinpoint where the 
mistake is and the party responsible for it. But, it is in 
mankind's interest that we all cooperate to prevent mistakes. 
But, if mistakes are committed, then we all have to do what we 
can to minimize their impact as much as possible, particularly 
if they have to do with humanitarian issues which directly 
affect the individual and his rights. 
  Some speakers said that they have noticed that many 
quarters used to believe that the injustice emanating from this 
or that country would last for a long time. But that now they 
no longer believe this. They also used to believe that some 
would collapse from the blows that were dealt against them. As 
of now, they no longer say this and, instead, affirm that Iraq 
cannot collapse as a result of the blows it is dealt. 
  I would like to comment on this by saying the following: We 
must pinpoint how the opposition behaves, whether this side is 
right or wrong in what it does. This is an essential 
requirement of scientific research and analysis. However, what 
has more value for us are those who support what is right, 
irrespective of their preliminary assessment of whether right 
will triumph within a specific period of time, or will only 
triumph on the longer term. I believe that your stand is more 
sound than any of the stands adopted by the others who approach 
matters from a technical point of view. They support wrong when 
they believe wrong will triumph, and they support right when 
they believe it will triumph. What is important to us, from a 
humanitarian and principled standpoint, is that we support right 
irrespective of the results -- irrespective of whether right 
will triumph or not, from a technical point of view, within a 
specific period of time, or whether wrong is defeated or not, 
again from a technical point view, along with its defeat on the 
ideological level. 
  As a person from Iraq, and as an official from Iraq, I place 
high value on your stand because you supported right 
irrespective of the technical results it might attain in its 
confrontation with these major blocs with their immense material 
potential and because you opted for this honest and sound stand. 
Humanity has many worries. This dictates that all of us must 
work hard for its sake. However, the most important thing that 
will save mankind from the pitfalls into which the leaders drag 
it is an honest and frank dialogue among the people and nations, 
whether through their popular organizations, or even through 
their rulers. Although some rulers speak about dialogue and how 
important it is, about democracy and how necessary it is, and 
about themselves and the influence they can have on others, 
they, in reality, do not like dialogue. 
  You know, for example, that former U.S. President Bush 
mobilized all media organizations to tarnish the image of Iraq. 
He wanted to affect the people of Iraq with his propaganda. We 
proposed that he directly address the people of Iraq. We also 
proposed that we broadcast his address or the debate, which we 
proposed to conduct with him, and, at the same time, have the 
debate broadcast in America so that the American and Iraqi 
people would make their judgment in light of the results of this 
debate, its nature, and its components. Our objective was to 
help those who stood on the side of justice or against it. He, 
however, rejected the proposal. In order to tackle the 
embarrassment caused by his rejection, he addressed a brief 
message to the people of Iraq that smacked of threat rather than 
a spirit of dialogue. 
  In any case, we should always know how to differentiate 
between the democracy that is only a political practice to serve 
the interests of the rulers, on one hand, and the democracy that 
stems from a principle based on respecting people and their will 
and on providing an appropriate atmosphere for this people to 
exercise their role in political life, on the other. 
  I have no doubt, and I know, that rulers in all democratic 
countries in the West pay great attention to public opinion in 
their countries. Why? This is because public opinion decides 
whether or not they will be reelected. However, when certain 
rulers believe that public opinion will not affect the results 
of elections they ignore public opinion in their countries. 
Therefore, if a ruler discovers that there is a journalist, a 
newspaper, or a television station that is ready to falsify some 
matters to promote his chances of winning -- or to hide a fact 
from public opinion so that his chances of winning will increase 
and the opportunities to weaken his winning chances will 
diminish -- he will not be disturbed. Neither will he say that 
such distortion is illegal because this has affected public 
opinion. He will not be disturbed by this. In fact, some of 
those rulers would work in order to provide such an atmosphere, 
given the rule we mentioned earlier with regard to the issue of 
elections. 
  The effects of any problem could be small when this problem 
is confined to one country. However, this problem could become 
bigger when some rulers, of the kind we spoke about, emerge in 
these countries. Despite this, they talk about themselves as 
being a country whose democratic approach must be followed by 
others, when, at the same time, they deny other peoples the 
right to choose their own approach. 
  Let us take another example you know, from America. You know 
that the war would not have broken out and the Security Council 
would not have adopted its resolution against Iraq had it not 
been for the American decision. Human blood was shed regardless 
of its source, whether a Frenchman was killed, an Iraqi was 
martyred, or an American was killed. They all were killed 
because of this war. False information contributed to making the 
war decision. False information was disseminated in America and 
the U.S. President and his aides were aware of it. They learned 
about the story of a young girl, who was the daughter of a 
Kuwaiti official, who was introduced to a film director in 
accordance with a special scenario, and who acted falsely when 
she cried on television. She told a story in which she said 
that she saw Iraqi soldiers taking incubators from Kuwaiti 
hospitals to take them to Baghdad. This story was later exposed 
and it became clear that the whole thing was fabricated. 
However, what happened to those who fabricated this story? This 
story was responsible for shedding the blood of many people. It 
played a role in making the American public accept the war idea. 
Thus, U.S. public opinion was deceived, and as a result of this 
deception, it gave in to the American rulers' premeditated 
intentions. 
  So, as peoples, wherever we find an official in charge who 
understands the peoples' principles and has faith in human 
relations, we must work hard to reach a sound level of human 
relations and of relations among peoples and nations. 
  The prophet says that a Muslim cannot commit adultery. Nor 
can a Muslim steal or lie. A Muslim cannot lie. So, when a 
Muslim ruler lies then he has lost every legitimate right to be 
a ruler. And you know that one of the Ten Commandments is: 
"Thou shalt not lie." 
  I do not want to take much of your time. Although we know 
that this is an uncommon opportunity, you are friends and guests 
in Iraq, and we should not bore you and or take advantage of 
your presence as guests here to explain all our problems to you. 
  The work you are undertaking is considered great by almighty 
God and the people of the world, because you are truly 
democratic and because you want others to enjoy what you 
yourselves are enjoying. Meanwhile, the others -- those who 
speak about democracy and human rights -- kill and slaughter 
people and persist in killing and starving them to death. 
  If we wish, we could become friends with this type of people 
overnight. But friendship for those rulers who mobilized their 
armies against us means that we should be illiterate, that we 
should disrespect our people, and that we should divide our 
people's wealth between us and them. They want this wealth to 
be personally divided. In other words, they want us to take the 
share that they give us so that we put it in the banks of 
Switzerland, England, America, or France, leaving our people 
hungry. They want us to give them the bigger share. Besides, 
they want us to rule in an autocratic way and to tell them that 
we accept any decision they make for us. 
  Isn't this the situation of their friends in the Third 
World, 
or at least in our region? Do you not know their names? 
  Such behavior cannot exist among the people of Iraq. The 
Iraqi people will not accept a ruler or a leader of this kind. 
If facts should be plain and the public should be left to 
realize matters as they truly are, then I do not think that the 
American people would wish to have such friends. Nor do I think 
that the American or the French people, who are known to be an 
enlightened people, or the Greek, German, English, and all 
European and world peoples would wish to have such friends. 
  Please convey our greetings on behalf of the Iraqi people to 
all those who attended your conference in Athens and told the 
truth. Please convey our greetings to all those who asked you to 
convey their greetings to the people of Iraq. 
  I also hope that George Kaloi [name as received] from 
Britain 
will convey my greetings to the Palestine Club that asked him to 
convey its greetings to us. This is what democratic thinking 
dictates. A democrat should be honest. It shows respect for 
others' opinions to convey the message honestly. If you, Mr. 
Kaloi, try to note what the English papers have said, you will 
not find a wide favorable response. 
  You are welcome.

  [Text] Fighting among rival groups in Kabul continued today 
despite a call by the Afghan Military Commanders Council for a 
cease-fire. Here is our colleague with a report on this. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, by telephone] It is reported 
that fighter planes belonging to General Dostam and Ahmad Shah 
Mas'ud appeared in the Kabul sky today and bombarded each 
other's positions. 
  During the past two days air attacks by warring forces have 
been very severe. While General Dostam's fighter planes have 
bombed the presidential palace and the Baghram military airport 
on several occasions, Ahmad Shah Mas'ud's fighter planes have 
attacked several of his opponents' positions, including 
Charasyab, situated 25 km south of Kabul. According to reports 
the presidential palace has been severely damaged. Furthermore, 
yesterday's bombing of Charasyab caused great damage to the 
Afghan prime minister's television center. The Afghan Hezb-e 
Eslami [Islamic Party] has, however, once again declared its 
neutrality concerning the current fighting in Kabul. 
  The secretary general of the Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic 
Unity Party] said yesterday: The current war -- just like the 
other conflicts in the past 21 months -- will not have a 
decisive effect in resolving the Afghan political problems. He 
added: The only way to resolve Afghan problems is to set up a 
neutral government in which the principal participants would be 
the four main political and military groups; that is, the Hezb-e 
Eslami, Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society], Hezb-e Wahdat-e 
Eslami, and the Afghan National Islamic Movement. Abdolali 
Mazari said: Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami cooperates with the other 
members of the Afghan Supreme Cooperation Council solely from a 
political point of view. 
  Meanwhile reports coming from Jalalabad indicate that 
thousands of refugees from Kabul are stranded without any 
shelter in cold mountain areas between Jalalabad and the 
Pakistani border. Kabul hospital sources say that the fighting 
in the past three weeks has left hundreds dead and more than 
8,000 injured.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Proposal To Deploy UN Forces Along the </F>
Line of Control"] 
  [Text] Citing Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan, 
the Indian English daily THE HINDU writes that Pakistan has 
expressed cautious reaction over an Indian proposal to convert 
the Line of Control [LOC] in Jammu and Kashmir into a line of 
peace and tranquility and has given the impression that Pakistan 
will be glad to hold direct talks, if this proposal reflects 
India's intention to reduce the forces deployed on the LOC. 
But, if India wants Pakistan to accept the current situation in 
Kashmir as it is, Pakistan is not ready for it. 
  Whenever India accuses Pakistan of interfering in occupied 
Kashmir, Pakistan puts up a proposal to have the LOC under U.N. 
supervision. But, India does not accept it. India also does 
not want the representatives of human rights organizations to 
visit occupied Kashmir and see for themselves the human rights 
violations there. Pakistan has positively responded to every 
positive proposal and will continue to do so. India should have 
the moral courage within itself to accept the proposal to let 
the LOC be supervised by the U.N. forces or the member countries 
of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. 
Pakistan is also ready to consider the reduction of forces 
along the LOC.

  [Text] Jordan denied that it had agreed with Israel on 
measures to control marine pollution in the Gulf of Aqaba. The 
head of Jordan's delegation to the environmental multilateral 
talks, Dr. Anis al-Mu'ashshir, said no such agreement was 
reached with Israel. He told "News at Ten" that there had been a 
decision by the environment multilateral meeting to establish 
three units in al- 'Aqabah, Elat, and Nuwaybi'. 
  Dr. al-Mu'ashshir said the units will be established with 
the 
help of the European Union, and will combat oil spills and 
pollution as well as deal with emergency situations in the Gulf 
of Aqaba. 
  He said the Europeans will discuss the implementation of the 
decision with Jordan, Israel, and Egypt, but stressed that this 
was in no way an agreement with Israel.

<F P=106> [Interview with PLO Executive Committee Member Mahmud 'Abbas </F>
(Abu-Mazin), by Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulaybi in Tunis; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [Al-Qulaybi] What is your answer to the 
opposition's criticism of the Oslo agreement? 
  ['Abbas] We will not answer those who copy the ideas of 
others, speak for others, or express the wishes of "certain 
parties concerned," nor will we pay any attention to those who 
do not read things and would not understand if they did read 
them, and if they did understand, they would only understand 
what agrees with their preconceived positions and decisions. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Al-Qulaybi] The agreement only applies to the West Bank and 
Gaza and covers only one third of the Palestinian people. It 
speaks briefly and in a very few words about the need to solve 
the problem of the refugees. 
  ['Abbas] The international terms of reference on which the 
Madrid, Washington, and Oslo negotiations were based are 
Resolutions 242 and 338. In 1988 the [Palestine] National 
Council [PNC] accepted commitment to these terms of reference as 
the basis. The Fes summit conference also committed itself to 
the international terms of reference and right of all states in 
the region to live in peace within secure borders. These two 
resolutions are what the negotiators uphold. 
  One article in Resolution 242 speaks of "a just solution to 
the refugee problem." In the past the Israelis tried to 
interpret the word "refugees" as covering the Jews who came from 
the Arab states to Israel. Its aim was to keep the resolution 
-- which actually was about the Palestinian refugees -- fluid. 
  The U.S. letter of assurances said that the refugee problem 
could be discussed in the multilateral as well as bilateral 
negotiations. That is why we raised it in the three 
multilateral rounds of negotiations in Ottawa, Oslo, and Tunis. 
[passage omitted] 
  So the refugee problem was discussed most extensively in the 
multilateral negotiations. As regards bilateral negotiations, 
since Resolution 242 was unequivocally and without any ambiguity 
confirmed as the term of reference and as it was confirmed that 
the refugee problem would be one of the main issues to be 
discussed in the final stage, which would be no later than two 
years after ratification of the agreement, that meant that the 
words covering that issue in the agreement, though few, were 
clear. [passage omitted] 
  [Al-Qulaybi] The agreement seeks an end to the intifadah and 
could lead to inter-Palestinian conflict. 
  ['Abbas] The intifadah broke out against the Israeli 
military occupation and escalated whenever Israeli repression, 
persecution, imprisonment, deportations, and curfews 
intensified. [passage omitted] 
  The intifadah got material, moral, and political support 
from 
abroad. It was possible to supply it with the means necessary 
for its continuation, through the PLO at the official level and 
the Palestinian masses who lived in the Gulf states. It also 
earned the sympathy of parties, peoples, and states throughout 
the world. [passage omitted] 
  The Gulf war, however, deprived the intifadah of all these 
resources, as 400,000 Palestinians who could support 1.5 million 
Palestinians inside and outside the occupied territory left 
Kuwait. As a result, we have a million Palestinians living 
below the poverty line. The PLO's resources ran out and it 
stopped its subsidies to the various institutions, societies, 
and individuals including the families of the martyrs, the 
wounded, and the detainees. The international community, angry 
at our position during the Gulf war, turned its back on us. So 
the intifadah stood alone in the battlefield. 
  Anyone who asks about the question of ending the intifadah 
or the need for its continuation should think first and foremost 
about securing the factors that would ensure its continuation 
and about the people who are suffering from the occupation and 
poverty at the same time, and should ask himself, why did the 
masses come out in the streets to express happiness and rejoice 
at the agreement? Has it occurred to those calling for the 
continuation of the intifadah what it means to go six years 
without schools, universities, or work? 
  The intifadah broke out against the occupation. If there is 
a glimmer of hope that the occupation will end, why should the 
people not turn to starting a new phase in their life to build 
their future and the future of their children and of future 
generations? The intifadah was not an end in itself. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Al-Qulaybi] The signing of the agreement was a recognition 
of Israel with no commitment to the creation of an independent 
Palestinian entity. In fact, it will lead to a feeble, 
subservient entity lacking in sovereignty. Perhaps the 
Gaza-Jericho option is in essence the end of the road. 
  ['Abbas] On the question of recognizing Israel's legitimacy, 
I would like to say so much about this matter but there is no 
room for that here now, so I will try to be as brief as possible. 
  First of all, the recognition of Israel occurred at the 1988 
19th session of the PNC, the highest Palestinian legislative 
authority. Therefore, the Oslo agreement represented nothing 
more than the start of practical implementation of that program, 
which was the culmination of many years of dialogue and many 
years of Palestinian struggle and many years of history and wars 
in the region and international conflicts linked to the region. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Arab world accepted the legitimacy of Israel's existence 
when it accepted Resolution 242 reinforced by Resolution 338, 
which gave Israel the right to exist within secure and 
recognized borders. Then came the Camp David agreement to 
create some kind of diplomatic relations between the biggest 
Arab state and Israel. 
  Then came the 1982 Fes summit resolution embracing a plan 
which provided for the recognition of Israel's right to exist. 
That summit gave Israel's existence full legitimacy in the name 
of the entire Arab nation. 
  Furthermore, the Arab states' acceptance of President Bush's 
1991 initiative and the initiation of their negotiations with 
Israel at bilateral and multilateral levels, involving 16 
states, confirmed that legitimacy before any Arab party 
concluded any agreement or treaty. Then there was the 
Jordanian-Israeli agreement on the agenda or declaration of 
principles and that was followed by the Palestinian-Israeli 
agreement. [passage omitted] 
  We do not claim that we signed an agreement of principles 
creating an independent Palestinian state, and there is no 
article that clearly says so. We must admit that we agreed on 
interim autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza. In principle, the 
so-called Gaza-Jericho option does not mean that the Palestinian 
authority will be confined to that, because such an 
interpretation of the Declaration of Principles would be a 
considerable distortion of the truth and would indicate some 
political myopia. If we examine the agreement we would see that 
Article 4, for instance, stipulates that the two sides consider 
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to be a single territorial unit 
whose unity and security should be maintained throughout the 
transitional period. [passage omitted] 
  When discussing the issue of sovereignty we should take into 
consideration the nature of the negotiations and the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It is a unique conflict and 
sovereignty has a special meaning. The sovereignty being 
discussed is a relative sovereignty of a special nature linked 
not so much to the principle of national rights of sovereignty 
as to the creation of a national entity that was not there 
before. The mechanism for the implementation of the agreement 
will lead to the progressive emergence and crystallization of 
the elements of sovereignty until they are fully achieved. 
[passage omitted] 
  The geographical jurisdiction of the Palestinian authority 
is 
clear and includes these occupied territories. The fact that 
Israel is trying to keep some territory is a matter of conflict. 
The texts are in our favor, and we have the two states which 
sponsored the agreement and the possibility of arbitration and 
so on, but we will not forfeit one inch of it. 
  [Al-Qulaybi] The agreement does not fulfill the Palestinian 
people's legitimate rights which were upheld by the 
international community. These rights have been the subject of 
bargaining in bilateral negotiations away from the UN authority 
and resolutions. The mutual recognition is neither complete, 
balanced, or just. 
  ['Abbas] Perhaps the detailed meaning of the legitimate 
political rights was left to the negotiations, but that phrase 
did appear in more than one place. The introduction spoke of 
the "recognition of the two peoples' political and legitimate 
rights." The third paragraph of Article 3 of the Declaration of 
Principles agreement stipulates that "the elections will be an 
important preparatory transitional step toward the fulfillment 
of the Palestinian people's legitimate rights and just demands." 
  As we are talking about a declaration of principles and not 
a 
detailed agreement, we believe that this issue was given due 
attention particularly as the agreement is fundamentally based 
on international legitimacy and its fulfillment. [passage 
omitted] 
  The fear of Israeli domination of the Arab economy that some 
people are talking about actually reflects a disgraceful sense 
of failure or inferiority on the part of the people who talk 
like that. 
  The Arabs have been talking about an Arab common market 
since 
the early sixties, about the same time Europe started talking 
about a European common market. Why has Europe now achieved 
economic union while the idea of an Arab common market remains 
just an idea in some people's minds? And finally, why is it 
that the volume of trade among 22 Arab states does not exceed 4 
percent of these states' trade with the outside world? [passage 
omitted] 
  [Al-Qulaybi] Israel supports a confederation with Jordan, 
not an independent state, because an independent state would 
prevent the annexation of some West Bank and Gaza territory, 
would prevent control of the water resources, and would not 
accept the annexation of Jerusalem. 
  ['Abbas] Israel seeks to annex parts of the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip and will try to control the water resources and 
maintain its annexation of Jerusalem regardless of whether the 
solution is going to be an independent or confederal state, but 
we must clarify a point which many people seem to find 
ambiguous, namely the word confederation. In international law 
there is only one definition of confederation. It is that "a 
confederation is a contractual agreement between two or more 
independent entities." This means that confederation and the 
independent state are not mutually exclusive. A confederation 
emanates from independent states. There is no other way. That 
is why we should not link Israel's wishes of annexation and 
control to the option that will ultimately materialize, namely 
confederation. Whatever the option, it is our duty to struggle 
until Resolution 242 is fully implemented so that there is full 
withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967 and so that 
the Palestinian entity is in control of all its resources, 
including water. 
  [Al-Qulaybi] There are risks in postponing the discussion of 
Jerusalem, the settlements, sovereignty, the borders, and the 
refugees to the final phase, that is five years. 
  ['Abbas] It was clear from the beginning that a number of 
issues would be postponed until the final phase which was 
supposed to begin with or during the third year. That explains 
why representatives of Jerusalem and the diaspora were excluded 
from the Madrid and Washington negotiations. It was also clear 
that the first phase would be that of interim Palestinian 
autonomy and that there would be no room in it for discussion of 
sovereignty and independence, which would come after the 
implementation of the first phase. 
  However, to eliminate some confusion from people's minds we 
say that the transitional period will not exceed five years 
(Article 1 of the agreement). In other words it could be a 
little less, or much less than that. [passage omitted] 
  It is known that Jerusalem was annexed to Israel by a 
Knesset 
decision but the mere fact that it was put on the agenda for the 
final phase means, from the Israeli point of view, that it is a 
disputed issue and that the annexation decision was void. We 
must realize, however, that these matters require great efforts 
and much time to resolve. We need to struggle and be patient. 
There are risks. There have been no agreements in history 
without risks. 
  [Al-Qulaybi] The real significance of the Oslo agreement is 
that Israel wants the PLO to play the part of the Village 
Leagues in return for big financial promises and greater 
influence in return for some oral concession made deliberately 
ambiguous to obstruct the negotiations. There is a belief that 
the system of government in the occupied territory would neither 
be democratic nor elected and that [the government] would be 
appointed by the PLO because Israel does not want democracy 
there. 
  ['Abbas] If we want to talk about abstract Israeli wishes 
in isolation from the objective circumstances then all that is 
being said is true because, to begin with, Israel was founded on 
Herzl's theory: "A land without people for people without a 
land." [passage omitted] 
  I have cited all these historical and real points to say 
that 
if the matter was left to Israel it would not have recognized 
anything and would not have accepted any solution. At one stage 
of the Palestinian national struggle it created the Village 
Leagues and then abandoned them when they failed to justify 
their existence and after they were rejected by the people. It 
is not right to draw a parallel between that and the Oslo 
agreement which speaks of the Palestinian people's legitimate 
political rights, withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, complete 
transfer of power with the exception of external security, 
executive, legislative, and judicial powers, general elections, 
and other things. 
  Why should we assume that the regime in the West Bank and 
the 
Gaza Strip would not be democratic and that [the government] 
would not be elected but appointed by the PLO? And if Israel 
wanted it to be that way, why should the PLO accept that, when 
it has been insisting on the principle of elections, on which 
there was an appendix? And even if, hypothetically, the PLO 
accepted that, who could force the people to accept it?

<F P=106> ["Circular" entitled "Beware of Psychological Warfare," </F>
issued by the Fatah Central Committee and signed by Committee 
Secretary Abu-al-Lutf (Faruq Qaddumi); date not given -- read by 
announcer] 
  [Text] To all brother members, friends, and the sons of our 
Palestinian people: 
  The Palestinian arena has suffered from many fabricated 
conflicts. Those who wish to create conflicts in the future are 
attempting to portray, in advance, the situation in the 
territory from which the Israeli enemy will withdraw. 
  The Mosad began to assassinate nationalist symbols and 
strugglers in the occupied territory just as the racist regime 
in South Africa assassinated struggler Chris Hani and created 
bloody riots in which hundreds of black citizens were killed. 
  The same experiment is being repeated in the Palestinian 
territory. The Israeli occupation could not fabricate bloody 
conflicts among the resistance factions, so it resorted to 
assassinations. Palestinian strugglers from all revolutionary 
factions -- such as Fatah, Hamas, the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine, and other factions -- were exposed to 
the killing and arrests we have seen in Gaza and the West Bank. 
The Israeli occupation wanted to create a state of chaos and 
insecurity on the eve of the promised Israeli withdrawal from 
the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area on 13 December. When these 
attempts failed, the Israeli occupation postponed the withdrawal 
and began to maliciously aggravate sensitivities and 
differences, (?embody) them, and exaggerate them. Some of us 
fell victims to this black media. International and hostile 
press contributed to the inflation of Palestinian events in 
order to portray the areas from which the enemy will withdraw as 
if they were moving toward conflagration. 
  This propaganda ended the joy felt by many people and 
created 
fear and concern in their hearts. This resulted in an internal 
situation that produced national, factional events and 
differences. Regrettably, the media and press highlighted these 
unjustified differences. People became more worried about 
security and stability and cautioned against the future. Many 
articles were published in newspapers and the Palestinian 
leadership was, for no reason, the target of criticism and 
defamation. 
  Popular awareness is necessary so that the masses will be 
ready for national reconciliation. It is also essential so that 
the leading cadres will be ready to undertake this mission 
through their deep understanding of the nature of the coming 
stage, which calls on them to be disciplined, calm, 
self-confident, and convinced in their future mission so that 
the masses will find security. 
  We must be aware that the Israeli occupation is the cause of 
our instability, starvation, and loss of our freedom of 
expression. The end of this occupation means the elimination of 
these diseases, which were caused by the occupation of our 
Palestinian territory for many years. Ending the occupation of 
a part of our land will certainly bring us back to normal and 
will prepare us to work seriously in building the free 
Palestinian society of the future. 
  Responsible behavior is a test for the awareness of the 
factions, cadres, and masses, which should not vie for 
authority, but should work for fostering cooperation between all 
parties for the sake of construction. Authority has not been 
attained yet, and the results of occupation are still before our 
eyes. 
  We ask every member of the police and security forces to 
behave as a loyal servant to the security of the masses. The 
police and security forces should maintain the masses' property 
and their freedom of expression. 
  The image in the masses' mind that the police and security 
forces are coming to impose a coercive system should be changed. 
The police and security forces have come to maintain human 
relations between the people and to provide the appropriate 
atmosphere so that the masses can resume their natural life from 
which they have been deprived for so long. They were deprived 
of holding parties, celebrations, meetings, and seminars. They 
were deprived of cooperating with various groups, and of 
establishing social, cultural, economic groups, and practicing 
all actions that the human being practices in a stable society. 
  This is the task of everyone affiliated with a movement, 
faction, organization, or political party, because democracy 
cannot be entrenched as an expression of human rights and 
freedom unless all Palestinian organizations act properly in 
dealing with one another first, and then in dealing with the 
masses in general. The factions should refrain from inciting 
differences or digging in the past, which might incite 
factional, family, or religious differences, so that every 
citizen will feel that the liberated homeland is his homeland, 
and that he is living in it freely, and is enjoying security and 
stability. 
  We stand before an experiment that the world is witnessing, 
and on the basis of which it will judge our good or bad 
performance and our administration of the liberated territories. 
The reaction of the friendly world and the donors will be good 
or bad in accordance with our administration and the national 
relations that we will weave between the citizens and the 
resistance factions, and their performance of their national 
duties on the ground. 
  There is no society that is free from social, political, or 
economic problems, but the developed societies give prominence 
to these problems and explain them in an objective manner. They 
try to resolve them through a collective effort after reaching 
the successful solutions for such problems. They keep rival 
groups away from fighting, confrontation, and inciting local 
conflicts to enable the national authority organs and the 
resistance factions carry out their duties comfortably, in a 
manner that keeps them away from confrontation with the masses 
and serve the masses' daily interests in an honest and sincere 
manner. 
  Our past experiences remained in our minds as Palestinians 
in 
spite of the signs of [word indistinct] that surfaced in the 
Palestinian society. We should return to our nature of national 
solidarity, collective action, and eagerness to serve the masses 
and offer all that they need in this transitional stage in which 
suspicion, doubt, and anxiety are abundant, and the enemy is 
sowing these fears in the whole Arab area. 
  The success of the Palestinian experiment is a success for 
the whole Arab area because the Palestine question is the crux 
of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and all that takes place within 
its framework is directly reflected on the Arab situation. 
Therefore, we should be a good example in behavior and 
performance when we build our future society. 
  From now, we recommend that voluntary teams of women be 
formed in every walk of life. Let us enable women to do 
considerable social and economic work; let us organize their 
efforts in social, economic, and cultural institutions; and let 
us open schools to train and enlighten them in order to qualify 
them and make them capable of work, sacrifice, and 
participation. If such groups had been formed in quarters and 
camps to carry out a comprehensive survey of people's needs, we 
would have been able to accelerate economic development. 
  We also should qualify youths, find job opportunities for 
them, and train them in all cultural, social, and economic 
fields. Let a school be opened every day for these youths so 
that our society can become full of qualified people capable of 
construction. Someone said that the voice of work is stronger 
than the roar of words. We have to take into account that the 
current transitional stage is witnessing some sort of mix of 
criticism, freedom of speech, and insult; of narrow sectarian 
prejudice and enlightened political affiliation; and of those 
who just raise national unity slogans and those who work to 
realize those slogans on the ground. We also notice another 
kind of mix in what is possible in this transitional period and 
what is impossible and of short-term and strategic goals. We 
have no magic wand to achieve what we want. Instead, we have to 
continue our struggle to make achievements gradually day after 
day and year after year. 
  We should not seek certain positions. Instead, we should 
work because work will lead us to suitable positions. We are 
not in a stage of sharing the booty, as some unexperienced 
people believe. We are now surveying and promoting our 
qualifications to carry out our missions and to continue our 
hard struggle, in which opinions on the ways to achieve national 
goals differ. The enemy, with its sins, is still penetrating 
our circles through the pains, the backwardness, and the social 
diseases it has left behind. We have to remove them through 
hard work and through our social and political awareness. 
  Let us refrain from punishing those who committed mistakes. 
Let us try to reform them and make them good citizens. We also 
should promote the spirit of cooperation among all the militant 
forces without exception, we should behave like instructors and 
educators, and we should forgive people of their mistakes by 
dealing with these mistakes in sound ways and far from grudge 
and hatred. The homeland is for every one, and every one has 
contributed to its liberation and has to contribute to its 
construction.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Nazzal, representative of the </F>
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Amman, by correspondent 
Sana' al-Imam in Damascus; from the "The Event" program; date 
not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Nazzal] From the beginning, our strategy took 
into consideration our particular circumstances, as well as 
objective considerations. We did not build our strategy on 
others' positions. Therefore, there has not been any change to 
Hamas' strategy of keeping up the struggle and resistance to 
occupation. 
  [Al-Imam] How fair would it be to say that your opposition 
to the PLO leadership overrides your opposition to a political 
settlement? 
  [Nazzal] Our objection to the ongoing political process was 
not prompted by our opposition to the PLO. Our differences with 
the PLO and its leadership are not personal. Our differences 
are about the approach. We are against the political 
settlement, given that it is not the right option for our people 
and that it will lead to the liquidation of our Palestinian case. 
  [Al-Imam] How do you assess the recent alliance struck 
between Hamas and other Palestinian factions that do not share 
your negative view of the peace project and the principle of 
peace with Israel? 
  [Nazzal] The meeting points between the constituent factions 
of the Alliance of Palestinian Forces may be summed up as 
follows: We are opposed to the Gaza-Jericho accord, which we 
will seek to topple with all possible means. Thus, we have 
transcended our political differences and concentrated on our 
common denominators. 
  [Al-Imam] Looking ahead, what do you plan to do next? 
  [Nazzal] For us, the Gaza-Jericho accord was stillborn, and 
carries the seeds of its demise. The agreement will not 
survive. We are counting on the political maturity of our 
Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic masses. Over time, they will 
discover that the PLO leadership has made unrealizable promises 
that will turn out to be a mirage which will not satisfy any 
thirst. Thirdly, [number as heard] we bet on the resistance 
option. Hamas, along with the rest of the decent and dedicated 
Palestinians, will carry on resistance to occupation and give it 
no security or stability. These are the bets for our cause's 
foreseeable future. 
  [Al-Imam] Brother Muhammad: In the event of a change in the 
region's political landscape, and a number of Arab countries 
invovled in the peace process concluding deals with Israel, how 
will Hamas react? 
  [Nazzal] We hate to reach the point where other Arab states 
will sign agreements with Israel. Assuming this did happen, 
Hamas would still stick to its strategic option of resistance to 
occupation and dealing it painful blows. This is our strategy 
and is not subject to change.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. George Habash, secretary general of the </F>
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), by Salim 
Badawi; from the "The Event" program; place and date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Badawi] We began our interview with Dr. Habash with 
a question about the nature of the PFLP's opposition to the 
peace process. Does he oppose the principle of peace, or just 
the proposed peace plans? 
  [Habash] In fact, we oppose the current peace plan which is 
proposed by the U.S. Administration. Instead, we propose a 
peaceful solution to the Palestine question based on full 
compliance with UN resolutions. There is a difference between 
the letter and spirit of UN resolutions and the U.S. plan 
proposed to settle the Palestine question and the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. We want a peaceful solution to the conflict. 
Concerning our concept of this solution, we believe that it 
should pass through two stages; a stage at which this solution 
must be based on all UN resolutions, and at the same time, we 
want a strategic solution to this conflict. The strategic 
solution to the Palestine question is based on a democratic 
Palestine. This is the PFLP stand toward the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict and the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
  [Badawi] What can you say about the self-rule plan and the 
agreement which was prepared in Oslo and signed in Washington? 
  [Habash] We strongly resist this agreement, because it does 
not meet the minimum level of Palestinian demands. I do not 
want to talk about this plan's violation of the [PLO] Charter. 
Neither do I want to talk about the fact that this plan does 
not touch on the phased solution which is based on the 
self-determination, the state, and repatriation. However, I 
want to say that this plan, the Gaza-Jericho agreement leaves 
all major issues without a solution. The repatriation issue is 
left without a solution, the settlements issue, the Jerusalem 
issue, and borders are all left without a solution. The 
Gaza-Jericho agreement does not provide a solution for any of 
these issues. 
  [Badawi] But, the text of the agreement leaves the 
definitive settlement of these points to future stages. Do you 
doubt the credibility of this agreement, or that it will be able 
to secure self-rule and later a state for the Palestinian people? 
  [Habash] When this agreement postpones all these basic 
points 
to a future stage, who will decide the solution to all these 
issues? We say that the solution will be on the basis of the 
balance of powers. How can Yasir 'Arafat solve the question of 
Jerusalem, the question of settlements, and borders when he 
loses his principal weapons? The question of borders now 
represents a major problem. What will 'Arafat's stand be when he 
faces the question of settlements, when he has to tackle the 
issue of Jerusalem, and when he also has to tackle the question 
of self-determination and all the other basic issues for which 
the Palestinian people have struggled? 
  [Badawi] Dr. Habash, is your participation in an expanded 
Palestinian front, which opposes the Oslo agreement, and which 
includes the Islamic movements, part of a short or long-term 
strategy ? 
  [Habash] At present, there is a U.S. imperialist onslaught 
to 
settle the Palestinian cause and the Arab-Israeli conflict on 
the basis of the U.S. version. All forces should pool their 
efforts to confront this onslaught. This requires a long time. 
With respect to the confrontation of this onslaught, we support 
the establishment of a front which may last for a long time and 
whose objective is to defeat this onslaught. Thus, our alliance 
may be considered a tactical one if viewed from this angle, and 
if one views it from a strategic angle, meaning it seeks to 
confront this onslaught and triumph over it, then this needs 
much time. 
  [Badawi] But all observers ask: What makes George Habash 
close to Hamas and the Islamic Jihad? 
  [Habash] Our agreement with Hamas now is not based on 
ideological principles, it has political basis. Whether in 
Palestine or in the Arab world, we agree politically on fighting 
against this onslaught which is embodied by the American 
solution to the Middle East issue. This is the basis of our 
agreement with Hamas and all the other political Islamic 
factions which confront this onslaught. 
  [Badawi] Dr. Habash, do you expect the recent Geneva summit 
between Presidents Clinton and al-Asad to have any effect on the 
opposition methods you adopt against the current settlement plan? 
  [Habash] I do not think so. This is because our struggle in 
the PFLP, and this also applies to Hamas, is based on struggle 
inside the occupied territories. Concerning this issue, Syria 
still strongly supports the intifadah. Therefore, I do not 
believe that we are facing a great division between the Alliance 
of Palestinian Forces and Syria. Moreover, we must consider 
that despite the Geneva summit, Syria continues to demand the 
implementation of all UN resolutions, not only with respect to 
the Golan, but also with respect to Lebanon and the occupied 
territories, including Jerusalem. This means that this issue 
will be a long drawn out one, especially since we must take into 
consideration the intransigent Israeli attitude. What was 
Israel's attitude in light of the summit and its results? 
Israel's answer was to hold a referendum. To me this looks 
like an attempt to escape from the process on the Syrian front. 
  [Badawi] But are you not worried about the return of Syria 
and Lebanon to the negotiating table following a freeze of 
several months in the bilateral talks? Doesn't this reinvolve 
you in political isolation? 
  [Habash] No. There were negotiations while we were in Syria 
and there has been an implicit alliance between us and Syria 
since the Madrid conference, taking into consideration that it 
is an indication of this process. [sentence as heard] Despite 
this, there has been a kind of alliance between us and Syria. 
[sentence as heard] 
  [Badawi] Dr. Habash, on what are you counting to tip the 
future equation in your favor in and outside the territories? 
  [Habash] We primarily depend on two basic factors: The first 
is an objective one; our understanding of the Zionist scheme. 
The Zionist scheme fully conflicts with the basic concepts of 
our Palestinian and Arab national rights. This is the first 
factor. The other factor on which we depend is our masses, our 
Palestinian and Arab masses. These masses will never accept the 
hegemony of the Zionist onslaught and its designs, and the 
attainment of its objectives in this manner. From this premise, 
we feel that no matter what the obstacles and the difficulties, 
and the Palestinian or Arab defeatist stands, our Palestinian 
and Arab masses will ultimately triumph over this scheme, the 
scheme of injustice and aggression that the Zionist authorities 
represent. 
  [Badawi] Dr. Habash, my last question: If the Israeli 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho takes place in April, will 
George Habash go back to the occupied territories? 
  [Habash] I will return in one instance. I will return when I 
return with my people. It is inconceivable for me to isolate 
myself from my people. Thus, if an agreement takes place--and 
the issue of the withdrawal is far-fetched because there will be 
no withdrawal, only redeployment--even if this redeployment 
takes place, we will pursue our struggle on the basis of freedom 
and independence, on the basis of the national program, the 
program consisting of repatriation, self-determination, and the 
establishment of the Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its 
capital.

<F P=106> [Salwa al-Ustuwani report from Damascus and unattributed </F>
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT report from Amman: "Palestinian Opposition 
Organizations Express Satisfaction With Summit Results"] 
  [Text] The Palestinians in Damascus have expressed general 
satisfaction with the U.S.-Syrian summit results. They saw 
President Hafiz al-Asad's Geneva declaration of insistence on a 
comprehensive solution on all fronts and on the UN Security 
Council resolutions as significant and positive for the peace 
process. 
  Dawud al-Talhami, member of the Political Bureau of the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] and its 
official spokesman, has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the emphasis 
on a comprehensive solution and rejection of partial and 
separate solutions was a positive sign particularly as such 
emphasis also came from the United States. He added that 
although there were no details and we still do not know what 
happened at the summit, for that will become clear in the 
future, what was emphatically stated by President Hafiz al-Asad 
calls for Palestinian satisfaction, particularly the insistence 
on a comprehensive solution, implementation of Resolutions 242, 
338, and 425, and the land-for-peace principle. Al-Talhami also 
said that what was stated by President al-Asad and supported by 
U.S. President Bill Clinton was positive and represented the 
essence of the position we adopt and whose fulfillment we desire.

  [Text] Jerusalem -- 'Ali Abu-Hilal, member of the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] 
political bureau and member of the Palestine National Council, 
has said that the Syrian-U.S. summit held in Geneva reflected 
the significant weight Syria carries in the region on all 
levels. A just and comprehensive peace, as well as security and 
stability, cannot be established in the region without taking 
into account Syria's interests and its ever-increasing important 
regional standing. 
  Abu-Hilal noted that the Syrian-U.S. summit affirmed that 
the 
United States needs to enhance and deepen its contacts with 
Syria and understand Syria's positions in the talks with Israel. 
The summit showed Syria's weight and its principled stance of 
adhering to the principle of a comprehensive and just solution 
in the region on all fronts on the basis of international 
legitimacy's resolutions, especially Security Council 
Resolutions 242, 338, and 425, as well as to the principle of 
land for peace as opposed to separate deals and bilateral 
solutions. 
  Abu-Hilal stressed that Syria's adherence to this stance is 
being welcomed and supported on the pan-Arab level, particularly 
by the Palestinians. 
  As for the results expected in the wake of this summit, 
Abu-Hilal expressed the belief that it will bring swift results. 
One of the immediate results of the summit is the revival of 
the peace process and the resumption of negotiations between 
Israel and the Arab parties in Washington. 
  Abu-Hilal said that the Syrian president spelled out the 
concept of a just and comprehensive peace and that the ball is 
now in the Israeli court. Israel's behavior will either 
increase or reduce the chances of achieving a comprehensive and 
just peace in return for full withdrawal on all fronts. 
  Abu-Hilal ruled out the possibility of Syria striking out, 
either now or later, against the Palestinian factions opposed to 
the Oslo accord, especially following the Syrian leadership's 
affirmation that this is a Palestinian concern and that it is 
legitimate for those factions to express their political views 
in a democratic way. Moreover, striking out against those 
factions is not in Syria's national and pan-Arab interests.

<F P=106> [Report by Badra Bakhus al-Fighali from Paris] </F>
  [Text] According to well-informed Palestinian sources, last 
week the PLO received from the external branch of the Israeli 
intelligence agency (Mosad) a security report containing details 
about an extremist Jewish network that was involved in a series 
of terrorist operations against a number of Palestinian students 
and Arab mayors. 
  The report was sent to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's 
office in response to a PLO request. The PLO had called on the 
Israeli Government to investigate the assassination of several 
Palestinian figures. The assassinations are believed to have 
been carried out as part of a scheme to undermine the peace 
process. 
  The Mosad report notes that a number of Palestinians living 
in the occupied territories who are opposed to the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement are involved in the 
assassinations. The mastermind of the deadly scheme, however, 
is a Jewish group calling itself "David's Sword." The group, 
led by Jewish clerics loyal to [the slain] Rabbi Meir Kahane, is 
believed to have massed considerable resources through its links 
to the U.S. Jewish community. 
  The report says that Mosad agents have arrested most of the 
group's members. In their apartments the Mosad found details of 
planned operations, weapons, explosives, two-way radios, and 
bugging devices. One member, Rabbi Efrayim Tolidano, routinely 
smuggled weapons from the United States to Israel. He was 
arrested in Lod [Ben-Gurion] Airport as he arrived from 
Washington loaded with cash and weapons.

<F P=106> [Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulaybi report: "Palestinian Spy Network </F>
for Mosad in Gaza"] 
  [Text] Tunis -- The PLO has managed to unravel the clues 
to recent assassination operations in the Gaza Strip which 
claimed the lives of three of its most prominent leaders in the 
strip: Lawyer Abu-Sha'ban, As'ad al-Saftawi, and Mahmud Kahil. 
  Investigations have revealed that a Palestinian spy network 
worked for the Israeli intelligence service Mosad in Gaza. 
  Palestinian security services inside discovered during their 
two-month investigations that this network received orders from 
Mosad to begin the assassination scheme. The security services 
managed to unravel the clues and enticed one of those implicated 
to go to Tunis at the end of last week. 
  This Palestinian is named as Ahmad Abu-'Awf, a resident of 
Khan Yunus. He is 24. He was enticed to go Tunis after 
visiting his brother in London. 
  Palestinian security services kept silent about this case to 
ensure that other members of the network would not escape. 
According to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's information, a committee has 
been formed from the inside and outside to follow up this 
delicate case.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Charles Enderin, including </F>
interviews with two unidentified arms dealers, and comment by 
Ahmad Hillis, a Fatah leader -- recorded; arms dealers and 
Hillis speak in Arabic with superimposed French translation] 
  [Announcer] Israelis and Palestinians today announced a 
real breakthrough in the negotiations over the Israeli 
withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho, negotiations that 
have been bogged down for three months. An agreement is all the 
more urgent because tension is rising on the ground, in 
particular, in Gaza where there are more and more clashes 
between Palestinians against a background where firearms are 
proliferating. Our correspondent Charles Enderlin reports: 
  [Enderlin; against video dated December 1993 showing masked 
uniformed men parading and firing into the air] The phenomenon 
has reached unprecedented proportions in Gaza. Whereas only 
three months ago fighters scarcely dared show their weaponry, 
today there are hardly any parades or rallies by Palestinian 
organizations without a show of assault rifles. 
  A huge underground firearms market has come into being. The 
dealers sell to organizations like Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] or Fatah, but also to individuals. 
  [Arms dealer] [video shows him sitting in home, with a few 
rifles and pistols; clip captioned: Gaza, this morning] I only 
sell to those who are defending society, not to people who buy 
weapons for the pleasure of walking around with a gun. 
  [Enderlin] Where do you import the goods from? 
  [Arms dealer] The Kalashnikovs come from Egypt. All the rest 
from Israel, in particular the ammunition. 
  [Second arms dealer] [video shows him standing outside 
house, 
waving a pistol] A 9-mm pistol like this one costs 3,000 
dollars, 18,000 francs. A Kalashnikov 36,000 francs; the highly 
prized American M-16 costs 66,000 francs. Before the agreement 
with Israel it was very hard and very dangerous to get hold of 
items like this. Today it is easy. There are a lot of goods, 
and the Israelis do not give a damn. 
  [Enderlin] The heads of the Fatah military wing are worried. 
They are afraid of accidents and inter-Palestinian clashes. 
They seize the weapons of individuals who do not belong to any 
movement. 
  Yesterday, several hundred students demonstrated outside the 
PLO headquarters against the sale of weapons, and against 
fratricidal clashes. Ahmad Hillis, one of the Fatah leaders, 
makes his accusations: 
  [Hillis] The Israeli authorities have completely stopped 
controlling weapons. But Gaza will not become a second Lebanon. 
If we have peace, things will settle down. Otherwise, all these 
weapons will be turned against Israel. 
  [Enderlin] Only the establishment of autonomy and the rapid 
deployment of the Palestinian police will prevent Gaza from 
sinking into anarchy.

  [Text] The National Liberation Front is the third party so 
far to announce its boycott of the national conference; the 
Socialist Forces Front was the first party to announce its 
boycott which was followed by the Workers Party [WP], which is 
led by Mrs. Louisa Hannoun, whose Central Committee has decided, 
following an emergency meeting held during the last two days, to 
boycott the national conference. In a statement received today 
by the Algerian Press Service, Mrs. Louisa Hannoun, WP's leader, 
pointed out that her party refuses to take part in the 
conference because the state of emergency still exists, 
political prisoners continue to be detained, and democratic 
freedoms continue to be absent.

the Rally for Culture and Democracy [RCD] announced that the 
party will not take part in the national conference [scheduled 
to take place on 25 January]. 
  However, the RCD has pointed out that the reason behind this 
decision was that the adopted platform on the transitional 
period to be discussed by the national conference contains a 
retraction from the one proposed by the Higher State Council.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Usamah al-Baz, Foreign 
Ministry first under secretary and director of the President's 
Office for Political Affairs, said that President Husni Mubarak 
and President 'Arafat today reviewed the PLO-Israeli 
negotiations in Oslo, the progress made in the Taba talks, and 
ways to achieve further progress on a formula to implement the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  Commenting on the Palestinian-Israeli talks, al-Baz said 
obviously the climate in which the talks are conducted has 
improved and become positive and that agreement between the two 
sides is likely in the next few weeks. 
  For his part, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian side 
in the Taba talks, said after his meeting today with Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa and Dr. Usamah al-Baz that important talks to 
overcome obstacles delaying an agreement on Gaza and Jericho, 
especially differences on the crossings and Jericho, were held 
after President 'Arafat's visit to Oslo and his meeting with the 
Israeli foreign minister. 
  Sha'th added that President 'Arafat briefed President 
Mubarak 
on developments in Oslo and discussed future steps with him. 
Sha'th said that President Mubarak invited the Palestinian 
delegation to a working breakfast with President 'Arafat. 
Presidents Mubarak and 'Arafat then asked the Palestinian 
delegation to meet with 'Amr Musa and Dr. al-Baz to continue 
discussion of a plan for a joint move to resolve the problems. 
  Sha'th affirmed that Egypt is exerting efforts, as it has 
been since the start of the negotiations, to resolve outstanding 
problems. 
  The head of the Palestinian side on the Gaza-Jericho 
Committee said that the latest talks in Taba saw a serious, 
objective attempt to break the deadlock. He added: We 
submitted a paper in Taba that was the subject of discussion in 
Oslo, and thus, the attempt to break the deadlock began in Taba 
and continued in Oslo and then in Cairo. 
  Sha'th said he will return to Taba after tomorrow, Tuesday, 
to resume negotiations with General Shahaq, who will be briefed 
by then on Shim'on Peres' view of the talks that were held with 
'Arafat in Oslo. He added that talks on the civilian authority 
will be resumed in Taba tomorrow. 
  He said that President 'Arafat will meet Shim'on Peres in 
Davos, Switzerland, on Sunday [30 January] and expressed his 
belief that the Davos meeting will help lead to an agreement 
soon. Sha'th added that no time has yet been fixed for a 
meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin.

  [Text] Cairo -- AL-ITTIHAD AL-USBU'I -- Informed Egyptian 
sources have affirmed that Egyptian Information Minister Safwat 
al-Sharif's recent mission to Libya was to inform Colonel 
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi that Cairo apologizes that it cannot 
welcome him for talks with President Husni Mubarak before it is 
confirmed that Libya has nothing to do with the disappearance of 
Libyan opposition figure Masnur al-Kikhya, who disappeared in 
Cairo in unclear circumstances. 
  Last week, al-Qadhdhafi again asked to visit Cairo or 
al-Sallum to remove the misunderstanding between his country and 
Egypt because of the al-Khikya incident. 
  In his message, al-Qadhdhafi renewed his offer to mediate 
between Egypt and Sudan and to host an Egyptian-Sudanese summit 
in Tripoli. 
  The Egyptian information minister told him that the Egyptian 
and Sudanese foreign ministers are holding contacts to resolve 
controversial issues between the two countries, and that any 
future summit depends on the success of the expected meeting 
between the two foreign ministers. 
  Safwat al-Sharif also informed Libyan officials that the 
Egyptian Government categorically refuses to deport Libyan 
opposition activists in Cairo because they have not violated the 
terms of political asylum granted to them. Libya had proposed 
that the opposition activists be deported from Cairo to avoid 
any tension their presence might cause to Egyptian-Libyan 
relations. 
  Egypt last week refused to welcome the senior Libyan 
official, al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi, who requested to visit Cairo 
during his recent presence in Tunis.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Jan (MENA)--The Higher State Security 
prosecutor today questioned wounded terrorist Muhammad Ahmad 
Farhan, who is currently under guard at the al-Qasr al-'Ayni 
Hospital after taking part in the al-Ma'sarah incident on 
Wednesday. 
  The terrorist confessed that his fugitive colleague Tharwat 
Hajjaj is the leader of their organization, which is made up of 
12 persons. It was Hajjaj who planned for him and his terrorist 
colleague Sami Isma'il Salih the attacks on the Majidah and 
al-Marwah movie theaters, the attack on a tourist bus in Misr 
al-Qadimah, and the assassination of police Brigadier General 
Ahmad Sha'lan, he added. 
  The terrorist confessed that his colleague Hajjaj had been 
present with them in the apartment and taken part in throwing 
bombs at security troops, then he took his wife and three 
children and fled. He pointed out that his colleague Sami 
Isma'il Salih had been responsible for conveying instructions 
from Afghanistan to the defendants as well as recruiting new and 
young members. 
  Wounded terrorist Farhan added that he had joined the 
organization five years ago; that he is a follower of Dr. 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman; and that he holds the belief that this society 
and regime are blasphemous. He noted that four members of 
Islamic groups had been frequenting the apartment in al-Ma'sarah 
to help prepare the bombs to be used in the operations. He 
confessed that he had taken part in the Zinhum incident, which 
was intended to assassinate some figures, and that he had 
committed 25 terrorist acts. 
  The prosecutor ordered the speedy arrest of defendant 
Tharwat 
Hajjaj as well as the four other defendants who frequented the 
al-Ma'sarah apartment.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 23 Jan (MENA)--Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi asserted that the government has not and will not keep 
silent about any incident of corruption, no matter who the 
perpetrator. 
  Addressing a People's Assembly session held today to debate 
the report of the committee tasked with replying to the 
government policy statement, Sidqi said every report on 
corruption or deviations from any source, even anonymous ones, 
is passed on for investigation with the knowledge of the 
authorities concerned. 
  He added that people must not be accused without evidence or 
according to mere reports because this is regarded as 
intellectual terrorism. Referring to newspaper reports on 
corruption cases, he said if such corruption happened in any 
society, such a society would be barbaric. 
  Speaking about corruption, Khalid Muhyi-al-Din, opposition 
leader in the People's Assembly, said he did not mean by his 
speech to accuse anyone and that he knows that Prime Minister 
Dr. 'Atif Sidqi is the one who ordered an investigation on 
Madinat al-Nasr's multimillionaire. He added that he knows the 
government, including not only the council of ministers but also 
the administration agency, is opposed to such acts. I do not 
mean to stand up against anyone or accuse anyone without 
evidence, he remarked. 
  Kamal al-Shadhili, minister of state for the People's 
Assembly and consultative council affairs, said corruption is 
not common practice, and that the prime minister has affirmed 
that neither corruption nor deviations will be protected and all 
such cases will be invesitgated. [passage omitted]

stated that Sudan's foreign relations with neighboring countries 
rely on firm principles, which are based on respect for existing 
regimes and borders and noninterference in internal affairs.

approve of the stability of Sudan and which strove to disrupt 
its relations with its neighbors. He said this yesterday when 
he met a Chinese media delegation. 
  The foreign minister pointed out the presence of foreign 
interference, which sought to disrupt good relations with 
fraternal Eritrea. He stressed that there was a need to be wary 
of such plots. 
  During the meeting, Dr. Abu-Salih reviewed Sudan's efforts 
to 
achieve an Arab accord. His excellency appealed to African

  [Report by 'Atif al-Ghamri in London] 
  [Text] Aldu Aju, deputy speaker of the Sudanese parliament 
[name and title as published], who announced his dissent from 
the Sudanese Government and asked for political asylum in 
Britain, has revealed the secrets behind transforming Sudan into 
a center for extremists from outside Sudan. He publicized the 
covert methods the Sudanese Government has resorted to to 
mislead the world about the locations and nature of training 
programs for terrorists inside Sudan. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM, Aldu clarified that at the 
beginning of the coup in 1989, the al-Bashir government's 
dealings with the international terrorist organizations inside 
Sudan used to be public. However, Sudan started to come under 
regional and international pressure and decided to resort to 
secrecy. 
  He highlighted the fact that all these activities take place 
under the control of al-Turabi's front, which is called the 
Islamic Front, that he will be talking from a position of 
authority, and that what he says are things he has seen for 
himself. 
  Aldu said: Their method of secrecy made them set up 
locations on the outskirts of Khartoum, which are private farms 
where training takes place. In addition, training takes place 
in mosques, where people usually come to pray. The extremists 
also show up among the crowds in the mosque, but they stay on 
until the training and guidance courses start. These go on 
until 0400. Iranians and other people from Arab countries do the 
training. 
  He added that the second method is to have public training 
centers for popular defense programs in numerous locations such 
as Jazirat Aba, Juba, and Danqilah. He said: For example, 
26,000 mujahid fighters were publicly graduated from training 
camps for popular defense in Jazirat Aba on 11 December 1992. 
He noted that to mislead people, secret training operations for 
terrorists take place as part of this public training. Aldu 
said: Extremists from Iran, Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], and other Islamic and Arab countries take part in 
these operations. Recently, some extremists from African 
countries were added to them, but their general guidance comes 
from Iran. 
  The third method is to set up what is called the 
"international friendship council" which is chaired by al-Bashir 
himself and is based in Khartoum. Its public duty is to support 
the relations of friendship with other people. But the reality 
is that this council is a tool through which contacts with all 
terrorist groups in the Arab world and Africa are maintained. 
  On the Sudanese people's stand on these operations, Aldu 
said 
that all job opportunities are doled out to those who undergo 
training that is under the control of the Islamic Front led by 
al- Turabi. He pointed out that the Front has organized a 
six-month training program in which each group of Sudanese is 
sent to Iran for training and returns after six months. After 
that, a second group is sent for another six months' training 
period. 
  Aldu Aju added that after their return to Sudan these 
individuals are distributed among the army, police, economic 
establishments, and embassies abroad, noting that all Sudanese 
diplomats are trained in Iran. 
  On the Sudanese people's attitude toward Egypt, Aju said: 
The Sudanese people want to resolve every dispute with Egypt, 
as relations between the two peoples are long-standing. Egypt 
must be interested in Sudanese events, Aju noted, saying that 
Egypt cannot just sit and look on. He said that Sudan is 
governed by one extremist party. He noted that the regime in 
Khartoum does not trust Sudanese national principles. It 
imports principles of violence and terrorism from abroad and 
acts to destabilize the entire region. Egypt, he said, is the 
largest force in the region and the Sudanese respect Egypt. 
  Aju said: The international friendship council is 
responsible for foreign policy in Sudan and all the things that 
the Sudanese foreign minister says regarding the negotiations to 
solve differences with Egypt will not lead to an agreement. He 
further noted that foreign policy in Sudan is not run by the 
foreign minister. 
  On the Khartoum government's foreign policy, Aju said that 
the Sudanese Government does not deal with governments but with 
extremists. It has no good ties with any neighboring Arab or 
African country but is trying to act in these countries against 
the governments and cited Ethiopia as an example. He said that 
this behavior affects Sudan's relations with the Arab world, 
Africa, and the whole world. 
  Aju noted that those who attended the Arab Islamic peoples 
conference that was held in Khartoum recently are extremists who 
came from Arab, Islamic, African, Asian, and even American 
countries. It was noted that the statements made at the 
conference were not critical but extremist. He pointed out that 
if religion had really been behind this behavior, Sudan would 
better have maintained good ties with Egypt because Egypt is the 
home of al- Azhar Mosque, which will never be secular. He noted 
that the events in Sudan are not motivated by religion but 
politics. He said that the Sudanese people are opposed to this 
state of affairs, but what can they do when rifles are directed 
at them and they are surrounded by security, spying, and 
intellectual suppression agencies and faced with the Islamic 
Front's control of livelihood, finance, and trade? Summing up 
the situation in Sudan, he said: Sudan is a state that has 
collapsed after the al-Bashir government destroyed the economy 
and all the state's departments. War in the south is 
exacerbating the destruction and the collapse is worsening.

al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, former prime minister and leader of the Ummah 
Party, in an attempt to persuade him agree to a reconciliation 
with the regime. 
  The sources said that Dr. al-Turabi made al-Mahdi "an 
astounding offer" expressing willingness to meet all the Ummah 
Party's demands if the latter agreed to merge with the NIF. 
  They added that al-Mahdi rejected the offer and told 
al-Turabi that the NIF cannot escape accountability and 
answerability for the harm done to the country. 
  Ummah Party sources contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT have 
confirmed these facts and said that non-Sudanese parties with 
NIF links also contacted al-Mahdi to persuade him to enter into 
a dialogue that would lead to a reconciliation with the regime 
but he refused to discuss the matter and submitted documents and 
facts showing the magnitude of the damage inflicted on the 
country over the past four years, pointing out that the NIF was 
responsible for that. 
  The Ummah Party sources said that al-Turabi admitted that 
the 
internal situation had reached a dead end. They also said that 
NIF officials who were members of the Sudanese Government's 
delegation to the second Abuja round of negotiations offered 
Garang's movement the option of merger with the NIF in one party 
but that was rejected by the movement on the grounds of vast 
differences between the views of the two sides. [passage

  Meanwhile, the Sudanese capital Khartoum is suffering from 
an 
acute fuel shortage leading to the reduction of the ration for 
taxi drivers to one gallon a day. There has also been a severe 
bread crisis in Khartoum for the past two weeks. Furthermore, 
circles close to the government have admitted that there is also 
a liquidity crisis which has delayed payment of the salaries of 
the government employees and members of the armed forces.

<F P=106> ["Message" from President Borhanoddin Rabbani; place and </F>
date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Dear listeners of radio Afghanistan, 
esteemed Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, president of the Islamic 
state of Afghanistan, presents a radio and television [as heard] 
message concerning the shameful and failed coup d'etat by the 
Globoddin-Karmal-Dostam satanic triangle and the victory of the 
Islamic army forces: 
  [Rabbani, in Dari] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate: Praise be upon the pure souls of dear martyrs of 
our beloved country and peace be upon the persecuted and heroic 
nation of Afghanistan, and in particular the noble citizens of 
bloody Kabul, who have witnessed grave pains and catastrophe 
prior to the victory, particularly after the victory of Jihad. 
  Faithful compatriots, the recent treacherous coup d'etat is 
the continuation of a series of consistent crimes that have been 
shaped by the enemies of Islam and our dear homeland outside the 
country's borders and that have been implemented one by one by 
treacherous elements and merciless murderers, the sworn enemies 
of our nation. The defeat of this bloody conspiracy along with 
its broad external and internal dimensions, is a gigantic 
victory and a historic deed by self-sacrificing heroic mojahedin 
and the wisdom of our new Islamic army. I congratulate the 
faithful nation and brave mojahedin, who with unprecedented 
courage stand in the trenches defending the soil of Islam and 
their homeland, on this great victory. I express thanks and 
gratitude to all leaders, the knowledgeable ulema, and dear 
commanders who have played a historic role in the defeat of this 
bloody coup d'etat and have supported the Islamic state. I 
sincerely thank all the people of Kabul, who have welcomed 
refugees from the affected areas; the state's services 
commission; the Red Crescent; the International Red Cross; and 
doctors and hospital personnel, who, with courage and sympathy, 
have rendered services to the wounded, the disabled, and 
refugees. 
  The Islamic state, while determined to uproot the reasons 
for 
the country's lack of stability in line with the wishes of the 
people, [words indistinct] to violate shamefully the life, 
property, and honor of the people, is ready to end the war with 
the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], which 
Hekmatyar, contrary to the will of its center of decision-making 
and contrary to the will of its commanders, has unilaterally 
participated in this bloody catastrophe. We believe the members 
of Hezb-e Eslami are never desirous of war against their 
colleagues-in-one-trench and mojahedin in the Islamic state. In 
particular, after the recent conspiracy, no one in the Hezb-e 
Eslami wants to stand against the [word indistinct] of faithful 
mojahedin in the Islamic state and against the whole nation and 
to be apparently those whose swords are with Yazid [person who 
killed Prophet Mohammad's grandson Husayn in Karbala'] and their 
hearts with Hosayn. 
  However, as far as it depends on the militia, the purging of 
professional murderers and the centers of corruption and 
savagery will continue until they surrender their weapons to the 
Afghan nation. 
  The Islamic state warmly welcomes the sympathetic efforts of 
leaders of the fraternal countries: Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, the 
Islamic Republic of Iran, the ICO [Islamic Conference 
Organization] foreign ministers conference, and the UN, who are 
making efforts toward the establishment of security and putting 
an end to bloodshed in Afghanistan. Special envoys of the 
Islamic state of Afghanistan have met and discussed this matter 
with the leaders of the fraternal countries, Pakistan and Saudi 
Arabia. A delegation will be sent soon to Tehran to gain the 
cooperation of this fraternal neighboring country in solving our 
problems, while thanking it for its goodwill efforts. 
  In the meantime the state sincerely welcomes all esteemed 
circles in the country who are making efforts toward peace. We 
hope their efforts bear fruit. 
  Concerning political changes in the country's future, this 
point should not be left unsaid: The Islamic state never allows 
conspirators to target the destiny of this nation for their 
sinister aims through killing and murder. The people have 
determined their political destiny through their presence within 
the Resolution and Settlement Council [Shra-e Hal wa 'Aqd]. We 
again give the right to the nation's representatives to appoint 
their future leadership through a gathering or elections in line 
with the country's special conditions. 
  We invite the ICO and UN representatives to take part in and 
help us with the process of elections or any other process our 
people choose. Peace be upon you. God be with you.

  [Text] Kabul, 23 Jan (MENA)--Afghan President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani has accused foreign powers of taking part in the 
abortive coup carried out against him on 1 January. 
  In an exclusive statement given to a MENA correspondent in 
Kabul, Rabbani reiterated that foreign powers planned and 
financed the conspiracy to achieve special covetous designs, 
although Afghanistan does not interfere in their affairs. The 
Afghan president said that the coup attempt was a vicious plot 
perpetrated by Golboddin Hekmatyar, General Abdul Rashid Dostam, 
the communists, and other parties in a bid to overthrow the 
Islamic regime in Kabul by armed force. He pointed out that 
they planned to execute the plot on the anniversary of the 
foundation of the Communist Party in Afghanistan. 
  The Afghan president described Gen. Dostam as a professional 
killer and a traitor. He said that Dostam is a remnant of the 
former communist regime. The Afghan president added that 
Golboddin Hekmatyar has distorted the image of jihad and 
mojahedin in Afghanistan. After the inception of the Islamic 
state in Afghanistan, we granted them amnesty with the hope that 
they would repent and contribute toward reconstructing a new 
Afghanistan, the Afghan president added. But, driven by their 
criminal nature, they decided to return to their conspiratorial 
course. 
  President Borhanoddin Rabbani noted that all Muslim 
scholars, 
shayks, mojahedin leaders, and Islamic political powers had 
responded to the Islamic jihad call. The Afghan president 
revealed that many mojahedin leaders, who belong to Hekmatyar 
groups, refused to take part in the coup attempt and rejected 
his alliance with Dostam. 
  Rabbani said that he will reject any contacts for a 
cease-fire with Dostam, but he added that it is possible to work 
out a kind of cease-fire formula with Hekmatyar provided there 
are guarantees that he would not violate it. The Afghan 
president stressed that the Afghan people are capable of 
crushing any domestic rebellion or foreign plot. The Afghan 
people will continue to support their Islamic state with all 
their strength, President Rabbani added.

  [Text] The Afghan prime minister, Mr. Golboddin Hekmatyar, 
has welcomed the proposal of Pakistan to convene a regional 
peace conference in Islamabad for finding a solution to the 
current crisis in Afghanistan. A spokesman of Hezb-e Eslami 
[Islamic Party of Afghanistan], (Ustab Kariborrahman Seyyed), 
told Radio Pakistan's Peshawar representative that all 
possibilities should be explored to bring about permanent peace 
and stability in Kabul. Any temporary arrangement, he said, 
will bear no fruits. 
  Commenting on Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani's address to the 
nation, the spokesman reiterated that the president should 
relinquish power in favor of a neutral interim government 
without delay to save the country from further devastation. 
  Meanwhile, AFGHAN ISLAMIC PRESS reports from Kabul that 18 
top-ranking officials of Parcham Party committed suicide in 
Kabul yesterday fearing tough reprisal by Mojahedin.

parties opposed to President Rabbani will welcome mediation 
efforts by any country, including Pakistan for the restoration 
of peace in Kabul. This was stated by a spokesman of Hezb-e 
Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], while talking to Radio 
Pakistan's representative in Peshawar this morning. He urged 
President Rabbani to accept cease-fire offer of 45-group of 
mojahedin commanders to pave the way for a dialogue to end the 
fighting in Afghanistan. 
  Reports from Afghanistan say Kabul was relatively calm this 
morning barring a few minor skirmishes.

  [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve and 
protect him, has chaired a joint meeting of the Revolution 
Command Council [RCC] and the Council of Ministers. At the 
beginning of the meeting, his excellency the leader president 
explained the reasons for increasing the state's purchasing 
prices of wheat and rice crops from farmers, especially at an 
early stage of the agricultural season. His excellency said: 
The announcement of the price increases will encourage farmers 
to pay more attention to fertilization, irrigation, and the use 
of pesticides, which will increase the agricultural crop and 
will show farmers a clear horizon to reassure them about the 
fate of their products after harvesting. 
  His excellency said that it is a national, economic, and 
technical duty of every one in this stage--a duty which will 
remain a priority in the future--to continue to encourage 
farmers to increase their production because agriculture 
provides food for citizens. He said that providing food and 
persisting in efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in food is a 
vital part of national security that it should be followed up 
with interest. His excellency said that it is not a luxury for 
us to decide to increase the states' purchasing prices of the 
basis agricultural crops. It is necessary to study the increase 
in the state's purchasing prices for other crops, such as corn, 
and industrial products. 
  In light of the instructions of the leader president, may 
God 
preserve him, it has been decided to increase the purchasing 
prices of wheat and barley for the current agricultural season 
as follows: 
  1. Wheat: The current price of 1 tonne of first-class wheat 
is 5,000 dinars. The new price of 1 tonne is 8,000 dinars. The 
current price of 1 tonne of coarse wheat is 4,750 dinars. The 
new price of 1 tonne is 7,500 dinars. Regarding other kinds, 
the current price of 1 tonne is 4,500 dinars. The new price of 
1 tonne is 7,000 dinars. 
  2. Barley: The current price of 1 tonne is 2,500 dinars. 
The new price of 1 tonne is 4,000 dinars. 
  The joint meeting of the RCC and the Council of Ministers 
then discussed the current budget and the investment plan for 
1994. In this regard, the leader president stressed commitment 
to the requirements of the march, which will be crowned with 
victory, God willing, if the ministries do not confuse the 
immediate and existing projects and services with medium or 
long-range goals. His excellency said: What is important is 
that we should remain effective and manage our resources well in 
this stage, and that after this stage, new and wide horizons 
will be opened for us, God willing. 
  His excellency also explained that the importance of this 
stage comes from the fact that the evil aggressors have been 
exposed as boring and illogical before the whole. Therefore, 
continuing to exert our utmost energy in production; in 
maintaining machines, equipment, and material; and fighting 
dissipation will increase the people's patience and 
steadfastness. Decreasing expenditures in building and 
operating projects, as well as choosing the least costly ways 
and alternatives will mean an increase in the Iraqi dinar's 
value, regardless of the size of the increase. The minister or 
the manager, who succeeds in reducing the cost of a 1 billion 
dinar project to 450 million dinars, for example, will feel the 
sweetness of this result because he, in fact, will have 
contributed to defending the homeland and the people. 
  His excellency also stressed the importance of increasing 
transportation energy this year, as it is important in 
transporting agricultural crops, industrial products, and 
workers in all sectors. At the end of the discussions, the 
meeting endorsed the current budget and the investment plan for 
1994. The joint meeting was attended by several technical 
cadres of the industrial sector.

  [Text] The [pro-Iraq] Kurdistan Revolutionary Party [KRP] 
has hailed with deep pride and appreciation leader President 
Saddam Husayn and his wise and brave leadership of our great 
Iraqi people. In a statement issued at the end of its Central 
Committee meeting, the KRP reiterated that it would place all 
its energy, its masses, and its friends at leader President 
Saddam Husayn's disposal in defense of the people and the 
homeland. 
  In its final statement, the KRP Central Committee denounced 
the imperialist-Zionist conspiracy against Iraq, and urged the 
international community to shoulder its full legal, human, and 
moral responsibility to lift, immediately and unconditionally, 
the blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. 
  The Central Committee condemned the criminal, terrorist, and 
destructive plan of the foreigner's agents, led by Jalal 
Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani in Kurdistan, stressing support for 
the Kurdish masses' perpetual struggle and their heroic daily 
confrontation of the agents of the foreigners. The KRP also 
stressed its determination to defend Kurdish national rights 
against slogan traders and brokers of international politics, 
who have turned the Kurdish cause into a commodity for 
bargaining and cheap blackmail in order to achieve their evil 
intentions. It also pledged to defend the homeland and 
safeguard the achievements and gains, which the 17-30 July 
revolution has given to the Kurdish people under the leadership 
of leader President Saddam Husayn, foremost of which is the 
Autonomous Region law. 
  The Central Committee emphasized the KRP's solidarity with 
the Palestinian Arab people to enable them to determine their 
fate and it denounced the American and the Zionist role in 
liquidating the Palestine question. It condemned the 
foreigners' occupation of Somalia, as well as the Egyptian 
regime's criminal positions against the Egyptian militant 
popular forces, and stressed the KRP's solidarity with the 
Yemeni people. It also said in its final statement that the 
Arab nation has no choice but unity and economic integration to 
confront all foreign challenges. 
  The KRP then warned the international community in general 
and the Arab nation in particular of the serious role U.S. 
imperialism is playing to control the world economy, and 
appealed to the international community to work to end the 
imperialist hegemony over the international organization.

  [Text] An ambush group belonging to the Islamic resistance 
forces last week carried out an operation targeted on 'Awdah 
'Atwan, a criminal belonging to the regime's intelligence organ. 
Our sources noted that the operation, which took place in the 
village of (Abu Hudaydah) in the Governorate of al-'Amarah 
resulted in the death of the above-mentioned person; his 
personal weapons were seized. Criminal 'Awdah 'Atwan is known 
by the residents of Abu Hudaydah and al-'Amarah marshlands as 
someone who sold his conscience and humanity to tyrant Saddam's 
regime. In doing so, he committed the ugliest crimes and 
attacks against innocent citizens. He personally executed three 
innocent citizens. 
  Last week, the Islamic resistance forces set up an ambush in 
one of the sensitive points along the road between the district 
of al-Majarr and the subdistrict of Nahr 'Udayl in the 
Governorate of al-'Amarah. Our sources in the south said that 
the ambushers succeeded in attacking a military vehicle [word 
indistinct] transporting some regime forces along the 
above-mentioned road. The attack destroyed the vehicle and 
killed or injured all those inside it. Our sources noted that 
the resistance men found identity cards and documents on the 
bodies of the regime's men proving that the destroyed vehicle 
belonged to the 1st Company of the 3d Regiment of the 704th 
Brigade, which is deployed in the marshlands of al-'Amarah. 
  The Islamic resistance forces returned safely to their 
bases. 
It later became clear that the regime had placed its forces in 
a state of alert and patrolled the road with armored vehicles.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 23, IRNA -- The meddling of the West in 
northern Iraq is threatening the security and integrity of Iraq 
and its neighbors, commented KAYHAN HAVAI. 
  In its latest issue, the bilingual weekly referred to the 
crimes committed by Jalal Talebani's Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan (PUK) against members of the Islamic movement in 
northern Iraq. 
  According to the weekly, the PUK "attacks were seen as an 
attempt by Talebani, under the aegis of the U.S. and its allies, 
to squeeze groups who have no sympathy towards his pro-Western 
approach." 
  Noting that the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) has remained 
neutral in the conflict, it said there remains no doubt "about 
the meddling by U.S., Britain and France whose troops are 
serving their national interests in Iraq's northern no-fly zone." 
  It referred to Talebani's Washington visit in 1992 and his 
talks about establishing an opposition government in the 
northern no-fly zone. 
  Stressing that Washington's policy is to get rid of Kurdish 
groups, it said "the West makes use of Kurds as a leverage to 
put pressure on Saddam Husayn's government and influence 
developments in Iraq. 
  "To any analyst there is an important question unanswered. 
If there are troops to protect Kurds from attacks by Saddam's 
army in the northern no-fly zone for humanitarian reasons, why 
are there no troops to protect Shiite Muslims in marshlands in 
southern Iraq for the same reason?" 
  It said that Washington considers Muslims as troublesome and 
dangerous for America's interests and perhaps for this reason 
the anti-Iraq alliance abandoned the idea to topple Saddam's 
regime. 
  The weekly concluded that there is no accurate evidence to 
prove that the West supports the establishment of an independent 
state for Kurds but that their meddling in northern Iraq is 
threatening the regional security and integrity.

  [Text] [Announcer] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat will meet again next Sunday [30 January] 
in Switzerland in a further attempt to break the deadlock over 
the implementation of Palestinian autonomy. There was no 
breakthrough after two rounds of talks over the weekend in Oslo, 
but significant progress was reportedly made on the questions of 
the border crossings and security arrangements in Gaza. Mark 
Weiss reports: 
  [Begin Weiss recording] Both Foreign Minister Peres and 
Yasir 'Arafat made significant concessions at the Oslo talks. 
According to Qol Yisra'el's diplomatic reporter Shlomo Raz, the 
PLO has now reportedly dropped its insistence that Palestinian 
policemen be present at the border crossings. In return, Israel 
will reportedly allow people crossing to enter directly to 
Jericho, and Israel will also allow the Palestinians to set up 
their own holiday resort on the Dead Sea. However, 
disagreements remain over the size of the autonomous Jericho 
area. Peres and 'Arafat also reached agreement on security 
arrangements for roads in the Gaza Strip leading to the Gush 
Qatif settlement bloc. 
  The Foreign Ministry's legal adviser Yo'el Singer and senior 
PLO official Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] will meet this week in an 
attempt to put into writing the points of agreement before Peres 
and 'Arafat meet again a week from today in Switzerland. 
  Speaking in Oslo last night, Peres said there is a chance 
that agreement can be reached in Switzerland on most of the 
points and there is a proper climate for such an agreement. 
'Arafat told reporters that some bridges have been overcome, 
but more time is needed. He said if there is a will there is a 
way, and both sides have this will. Peres and 'Arafat held 
their second round of talks after attending the funeral of 
Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst, who brokered last 
year's Oslo agreement. U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher said the strain of the peace process had contributed 
to his death, and said a peace agreement would do justice to his 
memory. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] In all, Israeli and Palestinian representatives 
will be meeting this week at several locations in talks to 
further the peace process. The Yo'el Singer-Abu-'Ala' meetings 
Mark Weiss reported on, the Taba talks on autonomy for Gaza and 
Jericho resume in Taba tomorrow, and in Washington discussions 
will start in the framework of the bilateral talks between 
Israel and the Arab states. The U.S. Administration is at the 
same time reported to be working to set up a summit meeting 
between Prime Minister Rabin and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 22 January on page A1 
carries 
an item by political correspondent Aluf Ben that reports Peres 
presented 'Arafat with a proposal to overcome the dispute over 
control of the border crossings. "Under the proposal, use would 
be made of advanced technology development in Israel to form `an 
unseen presence' of Israeli security officers in the Palestinian 
area of the crossings. The plan, in which several military 
industries are participating, has been approved by security 
elements and received Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's OK Thursday 
in his meeting with Peres. The PLO demanded in the negotiations 
that the Palestinian residents of the self-government in Gaza 
and Jericho `will not see Israelis' when they enter the 
crossings points, and agreed that Israel supervise the crossings 
from a distance through electronic means." 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 22 January, 
in a report by Gil Sedan in Oslo, says that "at Peres' 
initiative, a $25-million international fund, the initial budget 
for funding the Palestinian self-government, was set up. The 
United States will contribute $10 million and the rest will be 
divided evenly between the Scandinavian countries and Japan."]

  [Excerpt] Taba, 24 Jan (MENA)--MENA has learned that the 
Palestinian-Israeli Security Affairs Committee will not meet in 
Taba this week. The committee, which is chaired by Dr. Nabil 
Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, and Israeli Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq, will 
meet next week. The delay will allow the committee to take into 
account the outcome of the talks Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa is holding in Israel with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  According to responsible Palestinian sources, the Israelis 
are showing some flexibility in handling the Palestinian 
requests. In return, the Palestinians are showing understanding 
of Israeli security concerns. 
  The sources say that 'Arafat and Peres agreed during their 
meeting in Oslo that the Palestinian flag will be hoisted on the 
buildings that will be set up on the crossing points between 
Jericho and Jordan and between Gaza and Egypt to administer 
travel procedures. An Israeli security official will monitor 
the flow of travelers from behind a smoked, one-way mirror.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in </F>
Oslo by Karmit Gay -- live] 
  [Text] [Gay] We are told about progress but no 
breakthrough in the talks with the Palestinians. Is that 
correct? 
  [Peres] We are making progress all the time, the 
breakthrough in principle has already been made, now we have to 
make further progress. 
  [Gay] As we heard, you went into the details yesterday, so 
let us also go into them. For instance, the deployment of 
Palestinian policemen at the crossing points. Is it true that 
the PLO has agreed to yield on that? 
  [Peres] I do not want to go into details. We are 
negotiating and I think we are quite close to an agreement, but 
I prefer not to go into details at this stage. 
  [Gay] How close is quite close? 
  [Peres] If we receive reasonable answers from the other 
side, I think we will overcome the differences. In other words, 
things they said no to before, they are now reconsidering. We 
will give them time to review things and then see. 
  [Gay] If you do not want to go into details, then let us 
talk about the principle that previously they said no, and now 
they are saying perhaps, and tomorrow they might say no again, 
as has happened in the past. 
  [Peres] What has been signed is finalized, and we are now 
aspiring to sign a paper, which we will bring home, and on which 
we will consult with the prime minister. I do not think it pays 
to make haste in making statements instead of waiting a few more 
days and presenting things in a precise way. New ideas were 
raised and a breakthrough is in the offing, but until it is 
signed and entered in the protocols, a shadow hangs over the 
agreement itself. 
  [Gay] We heard that Foreign Ministry legal adviser Yo'el 
Singer will confer with Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] next week and 
that they will finalize everything in writing. Is that meant to 
prevent a situation in which one side can claim the following 
day that it was misinterpreted? 
  [Peres] Definitely. We want a paper signed by both sides. 
There is a genuine difficulty I do not want to dismiss. Except 
for the fact that both sides have internal problems, the real 
hardship is that it is an unprecedented agreement, it has 
nothing to base itself on and nobody to learn from. Therefore, 
any problem we come up against is not only a new problem but 
also sets a precedent. That is why we have to invest a great 
deal of what the Americans call creative effort to overcome the 
difficulties. I think we have succeeded in overcoming some of 
them. 
  [Gay] What about the Syrian track, can you tell us about any 
progress or an improved atmosphere on that track prior to 
tomorrow's Washington talks? 
  [Peres] No, not yet, but we will receive tomorrow initial 
indications in which direction things are moving. What is clear 
is that the United States is very, very interested in reaching 
an agreement, a comprehensive agreement, although for us a 
comprehensive agreement means with all the Arab states. 
  [Gay] Yes, but we are not signing the agreement with the 
United States, we are signing it with Syria, Jordan, and the 
Palestinians. 
  [Peres] Absolutely, that is why we are negotiating with 
them. I am simply saying that the United States is very 
interested and is offering its good offices in order to reach 
that, although it is very careful not to appear to be a 
participant. In other words, it does not raise its own 
proposals and is more of a facilitator to permit the sides to 
make progress. 
  [Gay] In reference to the international fund you helped set 
up yesterday. What can you tell us about that? 
  [Peres] The issue is that the Palestinians do not have the 
seed money to set up an administration or a police force. 
Foreign states do not tend to hand out funds to such an entity 
or organization because they all have to answer to their 
parliaments. What I suggested is a structure that permits the 
Palestinians to receive seed money and start implementing their 
plan, their actions. I suggested that a group made up of four 
trustees, a sort of mutual fund, be set up headed by a UN 
representative and have an American, a Norwegian, and a Japanese 
member. Later, I spoke with all those involved. The Japanese 
will probably donate $7.5 million, the Norwegians will give $7.5 
million, and the United States will donate $10 million. There 
will be a total of $25 million and the trustees will be the ones 
to decide on what to spend the money so that it will not be 
wasted on personal or political matters. That was done 
relatively quickly and it solved a complex problem at the 
initial stage. I suggested that it be called the Holst Fund, 
which was accepted. 
  [Gay] To conclude, can we hear your impression of Yasir 
'Arafat, whom you met yesterday. You were recently heard 
expressing hesitation and doubts about his ability to come up 
with the goods or his desire to do so. What was your impression 
yesterday? 
  [Peres] I got the impression that like you said, he wants to 
provide the goods, in other words, to complete the agreement. 
In our talks, he was very businesslike and what is called low 
key [last two words in English]. The deliberations were 
definitely based on logic and not emotions.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nabil Sha'th, head of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the Security Committee meetings with 
Israel, in Cairo, by Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio; date not 
given; from the "With the Events" program -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th: Do you expect a 
breakthrough in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in light of 
recent consultations between the sides? 
  [Sha'th] Yes, I do. If there is a breakthrough, it will be 
thanks to the most recent round of talks in Taba, which I had 
said would help us move forward on the security front. I 
believe that the meeting in Oslo between President 'Arafat and 
Foreign Minister Peres will be another contributing factor, 
along with our contacts here with President Husni Mubarak, 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, and Dr. Usamah al-Baz, and there is 
yet another meeting between 'Arafat and Minister Peres planned 
for next Saturday [29 January] in Davos. These contacts and the 
talks set to resume next Tuesday in Taba between ourselves and 
General Shahaq and the Israeli delegation should help us 
overcome the obstacles holding up an agreement. God willing, we 
will arrive at an agreement in February and Israeli withdrawal 
will get underway and the Declaration of Principles will be 
implemented. 
  [Mu'addi] When will the talks resume and what are the items 
on the agenda? 
  [Sha'th] The talks about the transfer of civilian 
administration resume in Aba tomorrow, Monday. The points 
agreed are now being drafted, and we are close to agreement. Of 
course, the more intractable issues such as water, archaeology, 
and regional planning will have to wait a bit. However, God 
willing, we will also make progress on those fronts. The 
security committee is scheduled to resume work on Tuesday with 
both chief delegates' participation. I believe that in light of 
the headway made in Oslo, we should not rule out fresh progress 
on the area of the Jericho enclave and the crossings. 
  [Mu'addi] Is it fair to say that the crossings problem is 
now behind us? 
  [Sha'th] We are close to a solution. Let's temper our 
optimism with realism and reason. 
  [Mu'addi] Given recent developments, what were 'Arafat's 
instructions to the Palestinian delegation? 
  [Sha'th] We are in constant touch with President 'Arafat. 
We met this morning, and we are to meet this afternoon before 
he travels to Saudi Arabia. We are in constant touch. He was 
here three days ago and is being updated regularly. He is 
asking that we work overtime to conclude the agreement. 
  [Mu'addi] Do you think that by the end of the month all 
issues blocking the implementation of the Declaration of 
Principles will have been sorted out? 
  [Sha'th] It is hard for me to set an exact date, since that 
will be a matter for the political leaderships of both sides. I 
think we are on the road to a solution. It is extremely hard 
for me to be more specific. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Sha'th, thank you so much. 
  [Sha'th] Thank you, Sa'id.

  [Excerpt] Taba, 24 Jan (MENA)--In Taba this morning 
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators began a third week of talks 
in connection with the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The negotiations resumed at 1030 when the Civilian Affairs 
Committee stemming from the Gaza-Jericho Committee met under 
lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi on the Palestinian side and Gadi Zohar, 
the Israeli official in charge of the civil administration in 
the occupied West Bank. 
  Al-Tarifi told MENA that the committee will discuss issues 
related to the transfer of civilian authority from Israel to the 
Palestinians. He said that this week's negotiations will focus 
on communications -- including radio, television, postal 
services, electricity -- and the Palestinian authority's right 
to enact legislation and handle town planning, civil 
registration, and travel documents. He added that the issue of 
water will be discussed not this week but next week. 
  MENA learned that Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, head of the radio and 
television corporation, and Engineer Amin 'Ulayyan have joined 
the Palestinian delegation negotiating the transfer of civilian 
authority because the setting up of a Palestinian radio and 
television station will be discussed. 
  The Palestinian negotiator stressed that there was progress 
during the past two weeks of negotiations on civilian issues 
when the two sides reached agreement on issuing identity cards 
and issues of residence, protected nature reserves, and public 
works. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Caroline Faraj] </F>
  [Excerpts] The heads of Arab and Israeli delegations to 
the bilateral peace talks are scheduled to meet in Washington 
today for consultations and coordination. [passage omitted] 
  In a telephone interview, Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, Jordan's 
ambassador in Washington and head of the Jordanian delegation to 
the bilateral negotiations, said these meetings are meant as 
consultation between the heads of the four delegations, in 
addition to the Israeli side, regarding the date and venue of 
the next round of negotiations. 
  Al-Tarawinah said that there will be a comprehensive 
assessment of the progress of negotiations on all tracks. In 
light of this assessment, the parties will examine the 
usefulness of holding another round of talks. They will also 
look at ways to reduce differences or obstacles that could 
obstruct the Arab-Israeli negotiations. [passage omitted] 
  Answering a question on the topics to be discussed on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track in the next round, al-Tarawinah said: 
No doubt, there have been many political developments since the 
end of the last round of the bilateral talks, and specifically 
since the signing of the Declaration of Principles between the 
PLO and Israel on 13 September 1993. A Jordanian-Israeli agenda 
was also signed, and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
visited the region. Add to this the Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva 
and finally the Jordanian-U.S. summit in Washington. 
  Dr. al-Tarawinah added: Regarding the Jordanian-Israeli 
track, the items on the agenda have not been discussed since the 
signing of the agenda on 14 September 1993. This is because 
there has not been a round of talks since then. 
  The head of the Jordanian delegation said: I think that in 
the new round we will discuss the agenda items. This is in 
addition to the meetings of the working groups on water, the 
environment, energy, security, borders, refugees, among others. 
He added that there is now a new dimension, which is the 
Palestinian-Jordanian economic agreement signed this month in 
Amman. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Jan (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General 
Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid left Cairo for Damascus yesterday on a 
four-day visit to Syria during which he will attend a two-day 
meeting of the Arab Organization for Agricultural Development 
that will begin tomorrow, Saturday. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that this visit will be a good 
opportunity to confer with Syrian officials. He emphasized that 
current important developments make such exchanges of views 
necessary. 
  'Abd-al-Majid said he met with U.S. Commerce Secretary 
Ronald 
Brown yesterday, Thursday, and discussed with him several issues 
connected with the peace process, regional economic cooperation, 
and the Arab boycott of Israel. 
  Asked if agreement was reached during his meeting with the 
U.S. commerce secretary to end this boycott, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid 
announced that the direct boycott will not be ended because the 
reasons for it still exist. He said he hoped these factors will 
soon disappear. 
  He added that what happened was that the U.S. secretary of 
commerce asked him to consider the possibility of terminating 
the indirect Arab boycott of Israel in view of its effect on a 
large number of U.S. companies which are being boycotted by the 
Arab countries because they deal with Israel.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Arab League Secretary General Dr. </F>
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, in Damascus, by Ashraf 'Abd-al-'Aziz in 
Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Welcome to our program. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Thank you. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Could you tell us about the talks you held 
with various officials in Damascus? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Actually, I came to Damascus to attend the 
annual session of the Arab agriculture ministers, which is 
sponsored by the Arab Agricultural Development Organization. 
During the meetings we looked into the agricultural strategy of 
the Arab World in light of developments in the region. In my 
opening speech, as well as in the talks I held, I emphasized the 
importance of peace in the region as well as of confronting the 
economic blocs that are being formed in other parts of the 
world. It is essential that the Arab World takes a clear 
position on these blocs, particularly following the signing of 
GATT and other economic agreements. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Let us talk for a while about the Arab 
economic strategy that the agriculture ministers are discussing. 
What is the Arab vision of this strategy, particularly in view 
of the current regional and international developments? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] The Arab vision has several parts. The Arabs 
need to maintain their food and water security. The Arabs 
should also find a way to confront the economic blocs that have 
sprung up in other parts of the world, particularly following 
the signing of GATT, an agreement that will affect [trade in] 
agricultural crops. 
  This topic....[pauses] The timing of the current meeting in 
Damascus was good. GATT was signed in December. The official 
signing ceremony will take place in April and then the agreement 
will be ratified. 
  Among the topics discussed during the meeting was ending the 
subsidies to agricultural products and farmers. This topic was 
given much thought in many countries during the GATT talks and 
the earlier talks in Uruguay. The Arab ministers are focusing 
on these issues. We hope that, by the end of the meeting in 
Damascus, a fuller picture will emerge of the Arab agricultural 
strategy. Such a strategy is needed to protect the Arab food 
and water supply, for it represents a part of Arab national 
security 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Let us have a look at the other challenges 
facing the Arab World, such as the issue of water. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] The issue of water, as I said, is one of the 
challenges preoccupying the Arab public in the entire region. 
Of course, this and other topics will be discussed again at the 
coming meeting of the Economic and Social Council, which will be 
held in Cairo in February, God willing. The Arab League Council 
will also review these topics during its regular session in 
March. 
  The timing of the meeting here was good, as well as the 
preparations. There is no doubt that the meeting and the 
discussions will help create a joint Arab position. This is all 
I have got to say on this subject. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do you see the future of Arab economic 
cooperation, especially in light of what is being touted as the 
possible establishment of a Middle East [trade] area? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] I have commented before and in length on the 
matter of the Middle East market. First of all, we have to 
discuss it with each other and see where we stand before we 
begin talking about a Middle East market involving non-Arabs. 
But, for starters, we should not be afraid of the prospect of a 
Middle East market. We should get our act together and see 
where our interests lie. I think that nothing can be imposed on 
Arab countries. These countries are sovereign and will not 
accept anything that contradicts their regional and pan-Arab 
interests. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] There is a question on the minds of all 
Arabs, private citizens as well as officials. What is happening 
on your initiative to achieve Arab reconciliation? How far has 
this initiative gone? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Hopefully, it is still alive and well. The 
responses I have received so far have been limited. Actually, I 
have received only 13 responses from the heads of states. But I 
believe that there is a possibility for further consultations 
about it. In the end, we will have to agree that it is in our 
interest to clear the Arab atmosphere and restore Arab 
solidarity, for this will strengthen the entire Arab World. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] How do you see these efforts proceeding? Is 
there hope for genuine reconciliation among the Arab brothers? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] I see some factors leading us somewhat 
toward 
clearing the Arab atmosphere. What is needed is more efforts. 
I am confident that the Arab World can exert these efforts. 
Arab reconciliation should be based on frankness. 
  ['Abd-al-'Aziz] Thank you. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General 'Ali Muhammad al-Mu'min, chief </F>
of staff of the Kuwaiti Armed Forces, by Samir Yasin; place and 
date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Yasin] What is the strategic objective of 
building a military force outgunned and outmanned by Iraq. Is 
it to stall an Iraqi offensive for a few days, pending the 
arrival of aid from the allies, or to be a match for the enemy 
and inflict defeat on it? 
  [Al-Mu'min] Relevant studies have been made and endorsed by 
the government. We are in the process of building a highly 
trained and technically advanced force with the potential of 
deterring aggression on Kuwait. We do have connections in the 
Gulf and wider Arab spheres, as well as with allies and friends. 
  [Yasin] The way Kuwait has diversified the sources of its 
arms purchases leads one to believe the contracts were awarded 
to reward the allies for their role in the liberation of Kuwait. 
How much of a role does politics play in Kuwait's arms 
purchases? Were previous purchases something of a reward? 
  [Al-Mu'min] The choice of one weapon over another is 
determined first and foremost by our defense requirements, as 
well as by quality. Without a doubt, the political factor does 
come into it, albeit only marginally. 
  [Yasin] You are concentrating on sophisticated weapons in 
pursuit of quality. How do you think you can offset the deficit 
in manpower qualified to absorb complex military technology? 
  [Al-Mu'min] We are indeed after such technologically 
sophisticated weaponry to make up for a deficit in manpower. I 
do not think, however, that the lack of personnel is that much 
of a problem. We conducted a survey, and it emerged that the 
human resources can be made available. We are now looking into 
how to institute incentives for a voluntary enlistment in the 
military. We need all the help we can get from the Kuwaiti 
people. Needless to say, joining the ranks of the military 
amounts to a career that may come in handy once a conscript is 
released from service. 
  Compulsory service and reservists together make up a good 
percentage of the military's requirements for personnel. It is 
also possible to recruit civilians for bureaucratic duties in 
the rear lines. 
  [Yasin] What are the ultimate military and political 
objectives you seek from the military training with the allied 
forces? 
  [Al-Mu'min] The most important objective we seek from 
military training is to upgrade Kuwaiti military efficiency in 
general, with an emphasis on dealing with foreign military 
forces to gain experience and establish joint coordination on 
the command level, taking into consideration the experiences of 
Desert Storm. 
  [Yasin] Has Kuwait benefited from the competition between 
the 
countries that export weapons? How this has taken place? 
  [Al-Mu'min] Yes, and this style is used to open the door for 
competition between various countries in the field of military 
industry. This competition encourages the companies to present 
their best offers. I cannot define specific fields in which 
Kuwait benefited from this competition, but this is something 
possible during the field experiments and through armament 
offers to Kuwait. 
  [Yasin] What military systems have been adopted by the 
Kuwaiti Army to ensure maximum benefit for the three fighting 
services when there is a need? 
  [Al-Mu'min] The current systems reflect the importance of 
cooperation between the three fighting services. This was 
emphasized during joint training. Systems on the command level 
were worked out, and there are representatives of each force in 
all other forces. 
  [Yasin] Iraq can produce a 150-km range missiles. How can 
this striking power, which is capable of hitting deep into 
Kuwait, be confronted? 
  [Al-Mu'min] We can confront this threat through taking a 
host 
of negative and positive precautions. The negative precautions 
are represented in security precautions and improving warning 
systems. As for the positive precautions, they are represented 
in being equipped with weapons able to deal with the Iraqi 
missiles, and we do not hide this objective. 
  [Yasin] The sea is seen as a main area from which Kuwaiti 
security can be penetrated. What stage has the process of 
reconstructing the Kuwait navy reached? 
  [Al-Mu'min] The naval force's plans were decided after the 
naval force conducted studies on its needs to carry out its 
duties. The studies are in an advanced stage of evaluation, but 
selecting boats and ships is more complicated than selecting 
other weapons. Deciding their specifications needs more time, 
but we have to take into consideration the protection of our 
waters and maritime borders. 
  [Yasin] Today is the third anniversary of the start of the 
liberation war, Desert Storm. What are the beneficial lessons 
of this war? Are these lessons being translated on the level of 
Kuwaiti military action?

  [Excerpts] Kuwait, 23 Jan -- R.L. Bhatia, Indian minister 
of state for external affairs, stressed today that the stability 
of the Gulf region was dependent on Iraq's compliance with all 
UN resolutions related to the war to liberate Kuwait. 
  In an exclusive interview with KUNA, Bhatia said that India, 
which had participated through the UN in formulating these 
resolutions, was aware that this was the way to achieve the 
prosperity [rakha'] of the region. 
  About his visit to Kuwait, Bhatia said that it was aimed at 
discussing prospects for cooperation and investment between the 
two countries. He said he had discussed the current economic 
reforms in India with the senior Kuwaiti officials he met today. 
[passage omitted] 
  Bhatia hailed Kuwaiti-Indian relations and described them as 
strong and historic, referring to the visits recently made by 
some Kuwaiti officials to India. [passage omitted on details of 
visits] 
  Regarding the conditions of Muslims in India after the 
destruction of the Babri mosque [in Ayodhya], Bhatia said that 
the situation has been stable, particularly since the recent 
elections in India. He stressed that Indian Muslims have been 
enjoying their rights on an equal basis as other citizens. 
[passage omitted on the destruction of Babri mosque in 1992] 
  Regarding the Kashmir issue, the Indian minister of state 
for 
foreign affairs said that that question concerned India and 
Pakistan and had to be resolved peacefully through bilateral 
talks. He said that many meetings have been held with the 
Pakistani side to discuss the issue. He pointed out that India 
submitted two proposals as a contribution to resolving the issue 
during a meeting between the foreign ministers of India and 
Pakistan in Islamabad at the beginning of this year. He said 
that the proposals concerned measures to build trust between the 
two countries, including the demarcation of sea boundaries 
between the two countries. 
  Regarding the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan, 
Bhatia said that India previously declared that it did not 
believe in the military use of nuclear energy and India used 
nuclear energy for civilian purposes. He revealed that India 
was discussing the question of disarmament with Pakistan, and 
expressed his hope that Islamabad would agree to that. 
  Regarding his tour after Kuwait, Bhatia said that he would 
visit Bahrain and Yemen to discuss the prospect of increasing 
trade exchanges and bolstering bilateral cooperation with 
Manamah and San'a'.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 23, IRNA -- Minister of the Interior 
'Ali Mohammad Besharati met the Emir of Qatar Shaykh Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani in Doha Sunday said the water supply project 
from Iran to Qatar is now past its feasibility study and was 
going ahead as originally planned. 
  He also suggested a concerted move by the petroleum 
exporting 
countries to reverse the downward trend of the oil price. 
  The emir of Qatar welcomed the proposal saying he would do 
everything possible, including a production cut, to ensure that 
oil prices would rise. 
  Besharati conveyed to Al Thani the greetings of Iranian 
President Hojjat ol-Eslam Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, and said 
that the ties between the two countries are based on mutual 
respect and non-interference in each other's affairs. 
  He said that the recent setting up of the Bushehr-Doha 
shipping line between the two countries should speed up trade 
and related ties between the two countries. 
  The Qatari ruler welcomed the idea of Iranian exports to his 
country and extended an invitation from Hojjat ol-Eslam 
Rafsanjani to visit his emirate. 
  Later today, the Iranian minister met the Qatari heir 
apparent Shaykh Bin-Hamad Khalifah Al Thani and discussed 
promotion of economic and political ties between the two 
countries. 
  In the meeting which was also attended by the Qatari 
interior 
minister, Shaykh Hamad called for promotion of Tehran-Doha ties 
in accordance with international laws, and appreciated Iran's 
support for Qatar's principled stands. 
  He also referred to Iran's relations with the United Arab 
Emirates, saying Qatar was making efforts to prevent 
exploitation of the issue of the three Persian Gulf islands, 
although it appreciates iran's sincere stand in this regard. 
  Regional countries should cooperate with each other and 
should realize that economic development depends on security in 
the region, said the Qatari heir apparent. 
  In the evening, Besharati accompanied by his Qatari 
counterpart visted the police headquarters.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 23, IRNA -- Iran's Interior Minister 
'Ali Mohammad Besharati underlined the importance of cooperation 
among the Persian Gulf countries as a guarantee of maintaining 
security in the region. 
  Speaking to reporters in Doha on Saturday [22 January], he 
said Iran as a powerful country which plays a major role in 
preservation of security and tranquility in the region, is ready 
to cooperate with regional countries. 
  He stressed that withdrawal of foreign forces and fleet from 
the Persian Gulf waters not only would not harm security in the 
region but would rather reinforce it. 
  Referring to Iran-UAE dispute, Besharati said the two 
neighbors could settle their dispute over one of the Persian 
Gulf islands through negotiations and remarked that Iran had 
repeatedly voiced readiness in this connection. 
  He further noted that interference of foreign countries 
should not be interpreted as their concern for security, adding 
that Iran would never interfere in the affairs of regional 
countries. 
  On fabrications made by some western media on human rights 
violation in Iran, the minister said those in fact were 
supporting terrorists who were involved in the massacre of many 
Iranian senior officials and civilians. 
  He regretted fratricide in Afghanistan and noted that Iran, 
like other Muslim countries, had made diplomatic efforts to 
establish peace and tranquility in that country and assured that 
the dispute could be solved through negotiations.

<F P=106> [Dispatch by 'Abdallah al-Shihri from Riyadh] </F>
  [Text] PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat is 
expected to arrive in Jeddah tonight on the first visit to Saudi 
Arabia since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. 
'Arafat, who will perform the minor pilgrimage, will be 
accompanied by a delegation which comprises Ahmad Quray', also 
known as Abu-'Ala', head of the PLO Economic Department, and 
Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO Information Department. 
Informed sources said that 'Arafat will head for Riyadh 
tomorrow to meet with King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz and senior 
Saudi officials. 
  Reliable sources said that 'Arafat will offer an official 
apology to the Saudi monarch for his stands during the Gulf war. 
'Arafat will also discuss with the custodian of the two holy 
mosques the developments in the Palestinian-Israeli accord on 
self-rule in the occupied territories, particularly following 
the Oslo meeting between 'Arafat and Peres, and the results of 
the summit meeting between Presidents Bill Clinton and Hafiz 
al-Asad as well as its repercussions on the peace process in the 
region. 
  'Arafat said in an arrival statement in Cairo this morning 
that he will meet with some Saudi officials to discuss the 
latest developments in the peace process. Hakam Bal'awi, the 
Palestinian ambassador in Tunis, said -- following his meeting 
Friday with the Saudi ambassador in Tunis -- that 'Arafat's 
meeting with King Fahd will strengthen Saudi-Palestinian 
relations as well as Arab solidarity.

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, Jan 22, SPA -- Saudi Arabia's Arabic 
newspapers today highlighted editorially Saudi Arabia's overall 
development and commented on the on-going peace process in the 
Middle East. [passage omitted] 
  Commenting on the peace process in the Middle East, the 
Jeddah- based AL-MADINAH said despite the Israeli maneuvers, a 
comprehensive settlement will be realized in the Middle East in 
view of the fact that it is being supported by the international 
public opinion. 
  "Moreover, the comprehensive settlement is supported by 
America and the Arab countries and at the same time it has 
become an essential matter after the end of the era of the Cold 
War," the paper added. 
  The Jeddah-based 'UKAZ deplored the intransigent policy of 
Israel and said the Israeli policy would block the march of 
peace. 
  The daily criticized the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin to hold referendum in Israel on the idea of 
restoring Golan Heights to Syria and said the proposal runs 
counter to the Resolutions 242 and 338 issued by the Security 
Council. 
  The idea of referendum constitutes a violation of the 
international law because it would be illogical to inquire from 
people of a country about the future of another country, the 
daily added. 
  The Dammam-based AL-YA'UM deplored a statement of Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in which he said Israel would not 
withdraw from Golan Heights before a visit of Syrian President 
Hafiz al-Asad to Israel and said such a statement was part of a 
series of the maneuvers practiced by Tel Aviv. 
  The paper called for a firm stand against the Israeli 
maneuvers and procrastination which aim at blocking the peace 
process. "It is high time for the U.S. to shorten the period of 
talks and take the appropriate measures for the implementation 
of the international resolutions," the paper said.

  [Text] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has voiced optimism 
regarding the document drawn up by the National Dialogue 
Committee to solve the dispute between leaders in north and 
south Yemen. The YSP Central Committee declared that the 
document, which was prepared with the help of various political 
forces, is a document of national consensus. 
  It appears, however, that implementing the agreement's 
clauses will run into some difficulties particularly in light of 
a reply message sent by Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas 
to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih accusing him of squandering 
public funds. Another difficulty is that the leaders in the 
south have stressed that their return to take up their posts in 
Sanaa hinges on the removal of the causes that made them leave 
the city in the first place. 
  Our correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit interviewed Prime Minister 
al-'Attas and prepared the following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jazulit] The YSP Central Committee held 
an 
extraordinary session in Aden today under the chairmanship of 
Yemeni Vice President and YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid. YSP deputies in the Yemeni parliament and the 
secretaries of YSP branches in Yemeni governorates attended the 
session. 
  [Al-'Attas] The YSP Central Committee has devoted 
considerable attention to this document. This meeting was held 
specifically to consider this document in a manner appropriate 
to its importance and to enable every YSP member to carry out 
his duty in implementing it. 
  [Jazulit] Therefore the YSP will sign the Pledge and Accord 
Document, isn't that right? 
  [Al-'Attas] The YSP will sign the document, as the National 
Dialogue Committee did, during a major ceremony, the date and 
venue of which will be agreed upon. This will happen when a 
special committee completes clause number seven which deals 
specifically with security arrangements and when guarantees are 
drawn up that the agreement will be implemented. 
  [Jazulit] What powers will be given to the vice president in 
the amended constitution? 
  [Al-'Attas] The vice president will assist the president and 
will carry out the president's tasks when he is abroad, ill, or 
cannot carry out his duties for any other reason. He will also 
have the power to supervise the prime minister's work in 
connection with local government affairs. 
  [Jazulit] Is the crisis in unified Yemen over or do some 
reservations persist? 
  [Al-'Attas] To tell the truth, some parties to the dialogue 
-- specifically parties within the coalition -- have some 
reservations about the document. This casts doubt on the 
prospects for implementing it. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Salah al-Qallab from Aden] </F>
  [Excerpts] It has become almost certain that the 
anticipated meeting between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid will be held 
in Amman. 
  A source at the Follow-Up Committee, which is making 
arrangements for this meeting, and which comprises several 
leading national and partisan figures, has informed AL-DUSTUR 
that the committee's preference is to see the ceremony for 
signing the document of understanding take place in the 
Jordanian capital under the auspices of His Majesty King Husayn 
and the Jordanian people. 
  The source added that since the security situation precludes 
the holding of such a meeting in Yemen, all parties prefer to 
see the reconciliation meeting between the Yemeni president and 
his deputy take place in Amman, given the role His Majesty King 
Husayn has played to achieve reconciliation, and also due to the 
balanced Jordanian position toward the Yemeni crisis from the 
outset. 
  The source indicated that invitations for this ceremony will 
be extended to some Arab leaders, foremost among which will be 
Omani Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, representatives of several foreign countries, and Arab 
League representatives after coordination is effected between 
the Yemeni Government and the Jordanian Government. 
  It is clear that the Follow-Up Committee charged with making 
arrangements for this meeting, which comprises Shaykh Sinan 
Abu-Luhum, Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, 'Abdallah 
al-Anisi, Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Culture Minister Jarallah 
'Umar, and Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, has agreed to hold the 
reconciliation meeting in Jordan in light of the contacts held 
within the past four days. 
  Given the current security situation, heightened tension, 
and 
several complicated circumstances, it has become very clear that 
it is impossible to hold the reconciliation meeting anywhere in 
Yemen. In this regard, several senior Yemeni officials said that 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih refuses to see the meeting take 
place in Hadramawt. Similarly, Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid is opposed to signing the reconciliation document in 
Sanaa. 
  Several Yemeni officials said that the security situation 
and 
mutual mistrust will prompt any official who will have to attend 
this meeting to bring with him a large number of guards and 
escorts to protect him, a number that could exceed 
5,000--something which would make it impossible to get the 
situation under control, and which might consequently cause a 
security disaster. [passage omitted] 
  It is to be recalled that the Yemeni vice president has 
welcomed the holding of this meeting in Amman. A senior 
official of the Yemeni Socialist Party has said: In case it is 
found to be impossible to hold the reconciliation meeting on 
Yemeni territory, our first preference is to see it held in 
Amman. (passage omitted] 
  AL-DUSTUR also learned that France expressed a willingness 
to 
host the reconciliation meeting on its territory. However, 
Yemeni officials said that they prefer to see it held on Arab 
territory if it is found to be impossible to hold it on Yemeni 
territory. They added that they prefer to see it held in Amman 
if an agreement is reached on holding it in an Arab capital.

<F P=106> [Hammud Munsir report: "'Ali Nasir Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F>
I Warn Against Impeding the Agreement; Local Government Would 
Ease the People's Suffering"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa -- Former Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir 
Muhammad has warned against any attempt to obstruct or retract 
the "document of pledge and accord" for the settlement of the 
Yemeni crisis. He said that "any such attempt would plunge the 
country into a whirlpool of unhelpful conflicts and divisions." 
  In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from his 
residence in the Syrian capital Damascus, he said it was very 
important that the agreement should go into practical 
implementation as soon as it was signed by Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and House of 
Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. 
He expressed hope that a venue and date would be set for the 
signing as soon as possible. [passage omitted] 
  'Ali Nasir also said: "What is important as far as we are 
concerned is that the basic principles reached should be 
implemented in an atmosphere of trust between members of the 
political leadership with nobody feeling that he won or lost. 
Everyone should feel that the triumph went to Yemen, the Yemeni 
people, their unity, and their stability." He emphasized the 
importance of implementation which, he said, was more 
significant than the signing. [passage omitted] 
  'Ali Nasir revealed that, in his telephone contacts with 
President Salih, Vice President al-Bid, and Shaykh al-Ahmar the 
day before yesterday, he received assurances that the 
subcommittee assigned by the the Dialogue Committee to make 
arrangements for the signing ceremony had already begun its work 
and was preparing to select a venue and set a date for the 
signing of the agreement. [passage omitted] 
  Concluding his telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he 
said that the local government system confirmed in the document 
was a worthy solution to many of the crises experienced under 
the Yemeni political system before and after the unity, and also 
an ideal solution for the people's suffering. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, the Sons of Yemen League believes that the 
agreement lays firm foundations for the building of united 
Yemen. In a statement it issued yesterday, it expressed full 
support for the document and appealed to all factions of the 
Yemeni people to stand united in support of that document and 
its implementation. 
  It said that any delay or dithering in the implementation of 
the document would lead to a greater crisis in Yemen with no 
time for the mediators to mediate and no time for dialogue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar al-Kuhali by </F>
Salih al-Qallab in Aden on 21 January] 
  [Text] [Al-Qallab] Views differ on the possibility of 
implementing the agreement of understanding reached a few days 
ago. As a responsible member of the government, the follow-up 
committee, and Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], what are the actual 
prospects for implementing this agreement? 
  [Al-Kuhali] It is difficult to be absolutely certain if this 
agreement will be implemented or not, but I earnestly hope that 
at least part of it will be implemented. However, even if this 
agreement is not implemented fully or partially, I believe that 
this agreement, which is actually a social contract, will remain 
a bright spot in Yemeni history. 
  If we cannot implement this document now, I am perfectly 
convinced that future Yemeni generations will produce leaders 
capable of implementing it because this document has created and 
will continue to create a new awareness of the need to establish 
a nation on the level of advanced nations based on institutions. 
  In short, I believe that this document is fit to be the 
national program of this generation. It is enough that our 
present generation is able to implement it or some of it at 
least. 
  [Al-Qallab] The follow-up committee, which was formed to 
implement this agreement and of which you are a member, is 
supposed to have taken some measures over the past three days. 
What has happened so far? 
  [Al-Kuhali] Yesterday we called for a meeting of the 
follow-up committee in Sanaa but I could not go because I was on 
a mission abroad. I found out that before attending such a 
meeting, I had to attend the YSP Central Committee and Political 
Bureau meetings, which will give the YSP views on this document. 
  Here, I would like to say that the YSP, represented by its 
Central Committee, Political Bureau, and other leaders, is 
committed to the very letter of this agreement and to 
implementing it and that the party will launch a large-scale 
campaign to muster popular support for what has been agreed on 
in the document of understanding. 
  [Al-Qallab] We heard two days ago that Shaykh 'Abdallah 
al-Ahmar, the speaker of the House of Representatives, raised 
certain objections to this document. Is this true or are these 
mere rumors? 
  [Al-Kuhali] I heard that Shaykh 'Abdallah raised certain 
objections to this agreement but I also heard that these 
objections have been withdrawn. I am happy to hear that. 
  [Al-Qallab] We also heard that the president insists that 
'Ali Salim al-Bid must return to Sanaa before the document is 
signed, that the agreement should be signed after al-Bid has 
resumed his normal official duties. Is this true? 
  [Al-Kuhali] This is another issue that will be discussed by 
the follow-up committee entrusted with preparations for the 
meeting between the president and the vice president and the 
meeting of the secretary generals of the parties. 
  [Al-Qallab] Obviously, you are attaching great importance to 
security matters in the agreement. Has there been any progress 
in this regard over the past few days? 
  [Al-Kuhali] No, nothing has been achieved so far, but even 
before reaching the agreement, the Interior Ministry tried to 
deal with the issue of the terrorists who were responsible for 
the assassinations and explosions that claimed the lives of so 
many people. Nothing has been achieved in this regard because 
those in control did not cooperate with the ministry. We hope 
such cooperation will materialize after the recent agreement. 
  [Al-Qallab] Yesterday, some of your newspapers said that a 
military plane from the south bombed military border positions 
in the north. How true is this report and why was it published? 
  [Al-Kuhali] First of all this report is absolutely untrue. 
The YSP is aware of what war means, what it means to have a 
warplane bomb military positions. For a plane to mount combat 
missions means that war is actually going on. This is not a 
joke and therefore, the report is baseless and fabricated. As 
to why this lie was disseminated, I have no idea. You can ask 
those who published it. 
  [Al-Qallab] It was decided to hold the reconciliation 
meeting 
between the president and his deputy in Hadramawt between 25 and 
30 January. Do you think that this meeting will take place in 
Hadramawt and within this timeframe? 
  [Al-Kuhali] As a member of the committee, I do not want to 
say anything in this regard before the committee meets and 
discusses this issue in detail and see what other options we 
have. 
  [Al-Qallab] You have said that this document may be for 
the future generations, what are the threats facing that 
agreement and its basic elements? 
  [Al-Kuhali] The document may not please certain parties and 
may pose a threat to the positions of certain centers of power. 
But I think the most important issues are the local government, 
removing military forces from cities, and arresting the 
"terrorists." 
  In all cases, let us wait. I think that, in the short term, 
some of those who feel they are the stronger party will seek to 
abort this document. As for the longer term, I believe that the 
Yemeni people will be the stronger party and will impose their 
will on everybody and implement the document sooner or later. 
  We have to start implementing what can be implemented now, 
and at the same time work on implementing this document in the 
future, because it concerns the interest of all people and 
because it is the document of all Yemeni political parties and 
forces, and not the document of the YSP or the General People's 
Congress. It does not mark the victory or the defeat of any 
party. It marks a triumph for the homeland and a genuine 
buttress for the state of unity. 
  [Al-Qallab] As a member of the follow-up committee, a 
government minister, and a YSP leader, aren't you afraid that a 
major security or military emergency will obstruct that 
agreement? 
  [Al-Kuhali] In fact such a concern exists, and I am not 
revealing any secrets by saying so. Yesterday I heard there was 
some military tension in Yarim area. I immediately called 
Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib and told him that we must 
work together and in quiet to prevent any surprises. I also 
urged vigilance because there are many parties that would not 
like to see that agreement implemented. 
  Frankly I share this concern, and I fear a major surprise in 
the security and military field. But in general, I think we 
should not worry so much about these concerns and work to 
implement this agreement and sign the document. I believe we 
are capable of confronting any emergency by combining resolve 
and self-restraint. 
  [Al-Qallab] Are things quiet now on the former borders 
between the two parts? 
  [Al-Kuhali] In fact troops are intermingled everywhere from 
'Amran to Lawdar and there is no tension in the way described by 
certain media. I stress that anyone who wagers on the split of 
the country will lose. 
  [Al-Qallab] Certain Arab parties, particularly Jordan, have 
exerted efforts to contain the Yemeni crisis. Has there been a 
decision to invite some Arab leaders to attend the celebrations 
marking the meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
the vice president? 
  [Al-Kuhali] We in the YSP welcome anyone who helped and 
supported us to attend these expected celebrations. Here I wish 
to underline the major role played by His Majesty King Husayn to 
protect the Yemeni unity and close the ranks. 
  [Al-Qallab] The YSP and its leaders have been accused of 
submitting to neighboring regional influences. What do you say? 
  [Al-Kuhali] One can understand that such things are said and 
used in political conflicts. These accusation are based on the 
fact that the other party has to defend itself against 
accusations of being out of touch with the age and rejecting the 
future. In all cases, these things have been said, but you know 
that such accusations exist in our Arab and Yemeni heritage. 
When we have a calamity we must attribute it to an enemy from 
outside or resolve it through a friend from outside. 
  I say that if we want to address our problems, then we must 
not take them to the outside. If the outside means the Gulf 
states, then the YSP is calling, emphatically, for new relations 
with these states on the basis of frankness, clarity, and common 
interests. We call for an Arab Peninsula free from 
confrontations or trenches. We do not wish to export ideology 
or slogans. We have to accept each other and coexist on clear 
basis and without subservience or submission. 
  [Al-Qallab] Is it true that the United States does not wish 
to see Yemen partitioned again? 
  [Al-Kuhali] Yes. We appreciate all the efforts that have 
been exerted to help us contain the crisis from the Arabs, 
Europe, and the United States. We welcome such efforts and 
roles.

<F P=106> [Interview with Major General 'Ali Muhammad al-Mu'min, chief </F>
of staff of the Kuwaiti Armed Forces, by Samir Yasin; place and 
date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Yasin] What is the strategic objective of 
building a military force outgunned and outmanned by Iraq. Is 
it to stall an Iraqi offensive for a few days, pending the 
arrival of aid from the allies, or to be a match for the enemy 
and inflict defeat on it? 
  [Al-Mu'min] Relevant studies have been made and endorsed by 
the government. We are in the process of building a highly 
trained and technically advanced force with the potential of 
deterring aggression on Kuwait. We do have connections in the 
Gulf and wider Arab spheres, as well as with allies and friends. 
  [Yasin] The way Kuwait has diversified the sources of its 
arms purchases leads one to believe the contracts were awarded 
to reward the allies for their role in the liberation of Kuwait. 
How much of a role does politics play in Kuwait's arms 
purchases? Were previous purchases something of a reward? 
  [Al-Mu'min] The choice of one weapon over another is 
determined first and foremost by our defense requirements, as 
well as by quality. Without a doubt, the political factor does 
come into it, albeit only marginally. 
  [Yasin] You are concentrating on sophisticated weapons in 
pursuit of quality. How do you think you can offset the deficit 
in manpower qualified to absorb complex military technology? 
  [Al-Mu'min] We are indeed after such technologically 
sophisticated weaponry to make up for a deficit in manpower. I 
do not think, however, that the lack of personnel is that much 
of a problem. We conducted a survey, and it emerged that the 
human resources can be made available. We are now looking into 
how to institute incentives for a voluntary enlistment in the 
military. We need all the help we can get from the Kuwaiti 
people. Needless to say, joining the ranks of the military 
amounts to a career that may come in handy once a conscript is 
released from service. 
  Compulsory service and reservists together make up a good 
percentage of the military's requirements for personnel. It is 
also possible to recruit civilians for bureaucratic duties in 
the rear lines. 
  [Yasin] What are the ultimate military and political 
objectives you seek from the military training with the allied 
forces? 
  [Al-Mu'min] The most important objective we seek from 
military training is to upgrade Kuwaiti military efficiency in 
general, with an emphasis on dealing with foreign military 
forces to gain experience and establish joint coordination on 
the command level, taking into consideration the experiences of 
Desert Storm. 
  [Yasin] Has Kuwait benefited from the competition between 
the 
countries that export weapons? How this has taken place? 
  [Al-Mu'min] Yes, and this style is used to open the door for 
competition between various countries in the field of military 
industry. This competition encourages the companies to present 
their best offers. I cannot define specific fields in which 
Kuwait benefited from this competition, but this is something 
possible during the field experiments and through armament 
offers to Kuwait. 
  [Yasin] What military systems have been adopted by the 
Kuwaiti Army to ensure maximum benefit for the three fighting 
services when there is a need? 
  [Al-Mu'min] The current systems reflect the importance of 
cooperation between the three fighting services. This was 
emphasized during joint training. Systems on the command level 
were worked out, and there are representatives of each force in 
all other forces. 
  [Yasin] Iraq can produce a 150-km range missiles. How can 
this striking power, which is capable of hitting deep into 
Kuwait, be confronted? 
  [Al-Mu'min] We can confront this threat through taking a 
host 
of negative and positive precautions. The negative precautions 
are represented in security precautions and improving warning 
systems. As for the positive precautions, they are represented 
in being equipped with weapons able to deal with the Iraqi 
missiles, and we do not hide this objective. 
  [Yasin] The sea is seen as a main area from which Kuwaiti 
security can be penetrated. What stage has the process of 
reconstructing the Kuwait navy reached? 
  [Al-Mu'min] The naval force's plans were decided after the 
naval force conducted studies on its needs to carry out its 
duties. The studies are in an advanced stage of evaluation, but 
selecting boats and ships is more complicated than selecting 
other weapons. Deciding their specifications needs more time, 
but we have to take into consideration the protection of our 
waters and maritime borders. 
  [Yasin] Today is the third anniversary of the start of the 
liberation war, Desert Storm. What are the beneficial lessons 
of this war? Are these lessons being translated on the level of 
Kuwaiti military action?

  [Excerpts] Kuwait, 23 Jan -- R.L. Bhatia, Indian minister 
of state for external affairs, stressed today that the stability 
of the Gulf region was dependent on Iraq's compliance with all 
UN resolutions related to the war to liberate Kuwait. 
  In an exclusive interview with KUNA, Bhatia said that India, 
which had participated through the UN in formulating these 
resolutions, was aware that this was the way to achieve the 
prosperity [rakha'] of the region. 
  About his visit to Kuwait, Bhatia said that it was aimed at 
discussing prospects for cooperation and investment between the 
two countries. He said he had discussed the current economic 
reforms in India with the senior Kuwaiti officials he met today. 
[passage omitted] 
  Bhatia hailed Kuwaiti-Indian relations and described them as 
strong and historic, referring to the visits recently made by 
some Kuwaiti officials to India. [passage omitted on details of 
visits] 
  Regarding the conditions of Muslims in India after the 
destruction of the Babri mosque [in Ayodhya], Bhatia said that 
the situation has been stable, particularly since the recent 
elections in India. He stressed that Indian Muslims have been 
enjoying their rights on an equal basis as other citizens. 
[passage omitted on the destruction of Babri mosque in 1992] 
  Regarding the Kashmir issue, the Indian minister of state 
for 
foreign affairs said that that question concerned India and 
Pakistan and had to be resolved peacefully through bilateral 
talks. He said that many meetings have been held with the 
Pakistani side to discuss the issue. He pointed out that India 
submitted two proposals as a contribution to resolving the issue 
during a meeting between the foreign ministers of India and 
Pakistan in Islamabad at the beginning of this year. He said 
that the proposals concerned measures to build trust between the 
two countries, including the demarcation of sea boundaries 
between the two countries. 
  Regarding the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan, 
Bhatia said that India previously declared that it did not 
believe in the military use of nuclear energy and India used 
nuclear energy for civilian purposes. He revealed that India 
was discussing the question of disarmament with Pakistan, and 
expressed his hope that Islamabad would agree to that. 
  Regarding his tour after Kuwait, Bhatia said that he would 
visit Bahrain and Yemen to discuss the prospect of increasing 
trade exchanges and bolstering bilateral cooperation with 
Manamah and San'a'.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 23, IRNA -- Minister of the Interior 
'Ali Mohammad Besharati met the Emir of Qatar Shaykh Khalifah 
Bin-Hamad Al Thani in Doha Sunday said the water supply project 
from Iran to Qatar is now past its feasibility study and was 
going ahead as originally planned. 
  He also suggested a concerted move by the petroleum 
exporting 
countries to reverse the downward trend of the oil price. 
  The emir of Qatar welcomed the proposal saying he would do 
everything possible, including a production cut, to ensure that 
oil prices would rise. 
  Besharati conveyed to Al Thani the greetings of Iranian 
President Hojjat ol-Eslam Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, and said 
that the ties between the two countries are based on mutual 
respect and non-interference in each other's affairs. 
  He said that the recent setting up of the Bushehr-Doha 
shipping line between the two countries should speed up trade 
and related ties between the two countries. 
  The Qatari ruler welcomed the idea of Iranian exports to his 
country and extended an invitation from Hojjat ol-Eslam 
Rafsanjani to visit his emirate. 
  Later today, the Iranian minister met the Qatari heir 
apparent Shaykh Bin-Hamad Khalifah Al Thani and discussed 
promotion of economic and political ties between the two 
countries. 
  In the meeting which was also attended by the Qatari 
interior 
minister, Shaykh Hamad called for promotion of Tehran-Doha ties 
in accordance with international laws, and appreciated Iran's 
support for Qatar's principled stands. 
  He also referred to Iran's relations with the United Arab 
Emirates, saying Qatar was making efforts to prevent 
exploitation of the issue of the three Persian Gulf islands, 
although it appreciates iran's sincere stand in this regard. 
  Regional countries should cooperate with each other and 
should realize that economic development depends on security in 
the region, said the Qatari heir apparent. 
  In the evening, Besharati accompanied by his Qatari 
counterpart visted the police headquarters.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 23, IRNA -- Iran's Interior Minister 
'Ali Mohammad Besharati underlined the importance of cooperation 
among the Persian Gulf countries as a guarantee of maintaining 
security in the region. 
  Speaking to reporters in Doha on Saturday [22 January], he 
said Iran as a powerful country which plays a major role in 
preservation of security and tranquility in the region, is ready 
to cooperate with regional countries. 
  He stressed that withdrawal of foreign forces and fleet from 
the Persian Gulf waters not only would not harm security in the 
region but would rather reinforce it. 
  Referring to Iran-UAE dispute, Besharati said the two 
neighbors could settle their dispute over one of the Persian 
Gulf islands through negotiations and remarked that Iran had 
repeatedly voiced readiness in this connection. 
  He further noted that interference of foreign countries 
should not be interpreted as their concern for security, adding 
that Iran would never interfere in the affairs of regional 
countries. 
  On fabrications made by some western media on human rights 
violation in Iran, the minister said those in fact were 
supporting terrorists who were involved in the massacre of many 
Iranian senior officials and civilians. 
  He regretted fratricide in Afghanistan and noted that Iran, 
like other Muslim countries, had made diplomatic efforts to 
establish peace and tranquility in that country and assured that 
the dispute could be solved through negotiations.

Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO Information Department. 
Informed sources said that 'Arafat will head for Riyadh

  [Excerpts] Riyadh, Jan 22, SPA -- Saudi Arabia's Arabic 
newspapers today highlighted editorially Saudi Arabia's overall 
development and commented on the on-going peace process in the 
Middle East. [passage omitted] 
  Commenting on the peace process in the Middle East, the 
Jeddah- based AL-MADINAH said despite the Israeli maneuvers, a 
comprehensive settlement will be realized in the Middle East in 
view of the fact that it is being supported by the international 
public opinion. 
  "Moreover, the comprehensive settlement is supported by 
America and the Arab countries and at the same time it has 
become an essential matter after the end of the era of the Cold 
War," the paper added. 
  The Jeddah-based 'UKAZ deplored the intransigent policy of 
Israel and said the Israeli policy would block the march of 
peace. 
  The daily criticized the proposal of Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin to hold referendum in Israel on the idea of 
restoring Golan Heights to Syria and said the proposal runs 
counter to the Resolutions 242 and 338 issued by the Security 
Council. 
  The idea of referendum constitutes a violation of the 
international law because it would be illogical to inquire from 
people of a country about the future of another country, the 
daily added. 
  The Dammam-based AL-YA'UM deplored a statement of Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in which he said Israel would not 
withdraw from Golan Heights before a visit of Syrian President 
Hafiz al-Asad to Israel and said such a statement was part of a 
series of the maneuvers practiced by Tel Aviv. 
  The paper called for a firm stand against the Israeli 
maneuvers and procrastination which aim at blocking the peace 
process. "It is high time for the U.S. to shorten the period of 
talks and take the appropriate measures for the implementation 
of the international resolutions," the paper said.

  [Text] The Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] has voiced optimism 
regarding the document drawn up by the National Dialogue 
Committee to solve the dispute between leaders in north and 
south Yemen. The YSP Central Committee declared that the 
document, which was prepared with the help of various political 
forces, is a document of national consensus. 
  It appears, however, that implementing the agreement's 
clauses will run into some difficulties particularly in light of 
a reply message sent by Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas 
to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih accusing him of squandering 
public funds. Another difficulty is that the leaders in the 
south have stressed that their return to take up their posts in 
Sanaa hinges on the removal of the causes that made them leave 
the city in the first place. 
  Our correspondent Tawfiq Jazulit interviewed Prime Minister 
al-'Attas and prepared the following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jazulit] The YSP Central Committee held 
an 
extraordinary session in Aden today under the chairmanship of 
Yemeni Vice President and YSP Secretary General 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid. YSP deputies in the Yemeni parliament and the 
secretaries of YSP branches in Yemeni governorates attended the 
session. 
  [Al-'Attas] The YSP Central Committee has devoted 
considerable attention to this document. This meeting was held 
specifically to consider this document in a manner appropriate 
to its importance and to enable every YSP member to carry out 
his duty in implementing it. 
  [Jazulit] Therefore the YSP will sign the Pledge and Accord 
Document, isn't that right? 
  [Al-'Attas] The YSP will sign the document, as the National 
Dialogue Committee did, during a major ceremony, the date and 
venue of which will be agreed upon. This will happen when a 
special committee completes clause number seven which deals 
specifically with security arrangements and when guarantees are 
drawn up that the agreement will be implemented. 
  [Jazulit] What powers will be given to the vice president in 
the amended constitution? 
  [Al-'Attas] The vice president will assist the president and 
will carry out the president's tasks when he is abroad, ill, or 
cannot carry out his duties for any other reason. He will also 
have the power to supervise the prime minister's work in 
connection with local government affairs. 
  [Jazulit] Is the crisis in unified Yemen over or do some 
reservations persist? 
  [Al-'Attas] To tell the truth, some parties to the dialogue 
-- specifically parties within the coalition -- have some 
reservations about the document. This casts doubt on the 
prospects for implementing it. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Salah al-Qallab from Aden] </F>
  [Excerpts] It has become almost certain that the 
anticipated meeting between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid will be held 
in Amman. 
  A source at the Follow-Up Committee, which is making 
arrangements for this meeting, and which comprises several 
leading national and partisan figures, has informed AL-DUSTUR 
that the committee's preference is to see the ceremony for 
signing the document of understanding take place in the 
Jordanian capital under the auspices of His Majesty King Husayn 
and the Jordanian people. 
  The source added that since the security situation precludes 
the holding of such a meeting in Yemen, all parties prefer to 
see the reconciliation meeting between the Yemeni president and 
his deputy take place in Amman, given the role His Majesty King 
Husayn has played to achieve reconciliation, and also due to the 
balanced Jordanian position toward the Yemeni crisis from the 
outset. 
  The source indicated that invitations for this ceremony will 
be extended to some Arab leaders, foremost among which will be 
Omani Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat, representatives of several foreign countries, and Arab 
League representatives after coordination is effected between 
the Yemeni Government and the Jordanian Government. 
  It is clear that the Follow-Up Committee charged with making 
arrangements for this meeting, which comprises Shaykh Sinan 
Abu-Luhum, Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, 'Abdallah 
al-Anisi, Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Culture Minister Jarallah 
'Umar, and Ahmad Jabir 'Afif, has agreed to hold the 
reconciliation meeting in Jordan in light of the contacts held 
within the past four days. 
  Given the current security situation, heightened tension, 
and 
several complicated circumstances, it has become very clear that 
it is impossible to hold the reconciliation meeting anywhere in 
Yemen. In this regard, several senior Yemeni officials said that 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih refuses to see the meeting take 
place in Hadramawt. Similarly, Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid is opposed to signing the reconciliation document in 
Sanaa. 
  Several Yemeni officials said that the security situation 
and 
mutual mistrust will prompt any official who will have to attend 
this meeting to bring with him a large number of guards and 
escorts to protect him, a number that could exceed 
5,000--something which would make it impossible to get the 
situation under control, and which might consequently cause a 
security disaster. [passage omitted] 
  It is to be recalled that the Yemeni vice president has 
welcomed the holding of this meeting in Amman. A senior 
official of the Yemeni Socialist Party has said: In case it is 
found to be impossible to hold the reconciliation meeting on 
Yemeni territory, our first preference is to see it held in 
Amman. (passage omitted] 
  AL-DUSTUR also learned that France expressed a willingness 
to 
host the reconciliation meeting on its territory. However, 
Yemeni officials said that they prefer to see it held on Arab 
territory if it is found to be impossible to hold it on Yemeni 
territory. They added that they prefer to see it held in Amman 
if an agreement is reached on holding it in an Arab capital.

<F P=106> [Hammud Munsir report: "'Ali Nasir Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F>
I Warn Against Impeding the Agreement; Local Government Would 
Ease the People's Suffering"] 
  [Excerpts] Sanaa -- Former Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir 
Muhammad has warned against any attempt to obstruct or retract 
the "document of pledge and accord" for the settlement of the 
Yemeni crisis. He said that "any such attempt would plunge the 
country into a whirlpool of unhelpful conflicts and divisions." 
  In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from his 
residence in the Syrian capital Damascus, he said it was very 
important that the agreement should go into practical 
implementation as soon as it was signed by Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and House of 
Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. 
He expressed hope that a venue and date would be set for the 
signing as soon as possible. [passage omitted] 
  'Ali Nasir also said: "What is important as far as we are 
concerned is that the basic principles reached should be 
implemented in an atmosphere of trust between members of the 
political leadership with nobody feeling that he won or lost. 
Everyone should feel that the triumph went to Yemen, the Yemeni 
people, their unity, and their stability." He emphasized the 
importance of implementation which, he said, was more 
significant than the signing. [passage omitted] 
  'Ali Nasir revealed that, in his telephone contacts with 
President Salih, Vice President al-Bid, and Shaykh al-Ahmar the 
day before yesterday, he received assurances that the 
subcommittee assigned by the the Dialogue Committee to make 
arrangements for the signing ceremony had already begun its work 
and was preparing to select a venue and set a date for the 
signing of the agreement. [passage omitted] 
  Concluding his telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he 
said that the local government system confirmed in the document 
was a worthy solution to many of the crises experienced under 
the Yemeni political system before and after the unity, and also 
an ideal solution for the people's suffering. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, the Sons of Yemen League believes that the 
agreement lays firm foundations for the building of united 
Yemen. In a statement it issued yesterday, it expressed full 
support for the document and appealed to all factions of the 
Yemeni people to stand united in support of that document and 
its implementation. 
  It said that any delay or dithering in the implementation of 
the document would lead to a greater crisis in Yemen with no 
time for the mediators to mediate and no time for dialogue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Culture Minister Jarallah 'Umar al-Kuhali by </F>
Salih al-Qallab in Aden on 21 January] 
  [Text] [Al-Qallab] Views differ on the possibility of 
implementing the agreement of understanding reached a few days 
ago. As a responsible member of the government, the follow-up 
committee, and Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], what are the actual 
prospects for implementing this agreement? 
  [Al-Kuhali] It is difficult to be absolutely certain if this 
agreement will be implemented or not, but I earnestly hope that 
at least part of it will be implemented. However, even if this 
agreement is not implemented fully or partially, I believe that 
this agreement, which is actually a social contract, will remain 
a bright spot in Yemeni history. 
  If we cannot implement this document now, I am perfectly 
convinced that future Yemeni generations will produce leaders 
capable of implementing it because this document has created and 
will continue to create a new awareness of the need to establish 
a nation on the level of advanced nations based on institutions. 
  In short, I believe that this document is fit to be the 
national program of this generation. It is enough that our 
present generation is able to implement it or some of it at 
least. 
  [Al-Qallab] The follow-up committee, which was formed to 
implement this agreement and of which you are a member, is 
supposed to have taken some measures over the past three days. 
What has happened so far? 
  [Al-Kuhali] Yesterday we called for a meeting of the 
follow-up committee in Sanaa but I could not go because I was on 
a mission abroad. I found out that before attending such a 
meeting, I had to attend the YSP Central Committee and Political 
Bureau meetings, which will give the YSP views on this document. 
  Here, I would like to say that the YSP, represented by its 
Central Committee, Political Bureau, and other leaders, is 
committed to the very letter of this agreement and to 
implementing it and that the party will launch a large-scale 
campaign to muster popular support for what has been agreed on 
in the document of understanding. 
  [Al-Qallab] We heard two days ago that Shaykh 'Abdallah 
al-Ahmar, the speaker of the House of Representatives, raised 
certain objections to this document. Is this true or are these 
mere rumors? 
  [Al-Kuhali] I heard that Shaykh 'Abdallah raised certain 
objections to this agreement but I also heard that these 
objections have been withdrawn. I am happy to hear that. 
  [Al-Qallab] We also heard that the president insists that 
'Ali Salim al-Bid must return to Sanaa before the document is 
signed, that the agreement should be signed after al-Bid has 
resumed his normal official duties. Is this true? 
  [Al-Kuhali] This is another issue that will be discussed by 
the follow-up committee entrusted with preparations for the 
meeting between the president and the vice president and the 
meeting of the secretary generals of the parties. 
  [Al-Qallab] Obviously, you are attaching great importance to 
security matters in the agreement. Has there been any progress 
in this regard over the past few days? 
  [Al-Kuhali] No, nothing has been achieved so far, but even 
before reaching the agreement, the Interior Ministry tried to 
deal with the issue of the terrorists who were responsible for 
the assassinations and explosions that claimed the lives of so 
many people. Nothing has been achieved in this regard because 
those in control did not cooperate with the ministry. We hope 
such cooperation will materialize after the recent agreement. 
  [Al-Qallab] Yesterday, some of your newspapers said that a 
military plane from the south bombed military border positions 
in the north. How true is this report and why was it published? 
  [Al-Kuhali] First of all this report is absolutely untrue. 
The YSP is aware of what war means, what it means to have a 
warplane bomb military positions. For a plane to mount combat 
missions means that war is actually going on. This is not a 
joke and therefore, the report is baseless and fabricated. As 
to why this lie was disseminated, I have no idea. You can ask 
those who published it. 
  [Al-Qallab] It was decided to hold the reconciliation 
meeting 
between the president and his deputy in Hadramawt between 25 and 
30 January. Do you think that this meeting will take place in 
Hadramawt and within this timeframe? 
  [Al-Kuhali] As a member of the committee, I do not want to 
say anything in this regard before the committee meets and 
discusses this issue in detail and see what other options we 
have. 
  [Al-Qallab] You have said that this document may be for 
the future generations, what are the threats facing that 
agreement and its basic elements? 
  [Al-Kuhali] The document may not please certain parties and 
may pose a threat to the positions of certain centers of power. 
But I think the most important issues are the local government, 
removing military forces from cities, and arresting the 
"terrorists." 
  In all cases, let us wait. I think that, in the short term, 
some of those who feel they are the stronger party will seek to 
abort this document. As for the longer term, I believe that the 
Yemeni people will be the stronger party and will impose their 
will on everybody and implement the document sooner or later. 
  We have to start implementing what can be implemented now, 
and at the same time work on implementing this document in the 
future, because it concerns the interest of all people and 
because it is the document of all Yemeni political parties and 
forces, and not the document of the YSP or the General People's 
Congress. It does not mark the victory or the defeat of any 
party. It marks a triumph for the homeland and a genuine 
buttress for the state of unity. 
  [Al-Qallab] As a member of the follow-up committee, a 
government minister, and a YSP leader, aren't you afraid that a 
major security or military emergency will obstruct that 
agreement? 
  [Al-Kuhali] In fact such a concern exists, and I am not 
revealing any secrets by saying so. Yesterday I heard there was 
some military tension in Yarim area. I immediately called 
Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib and told him that we must 
work together and in quiet to prevent any surprises. I also 
urged vigilance because there are many parties that would not 
like to see that agreement implemented. 
  Frankly I share this concern, and I fear a major surprise in 
the security and military field. But in general, I think we 
should not worry so much about these concerns and work to 
implement this agreement and sign the document. I believe we 
are capable of confronting any emergency by combining resolve 
and self-restraint. 
  [Al-Qallab] Are things quiet now on the former borders 
between the two parts? 
  [Al-Kuhali] In fact troops are intermingled everywhere from 
'Amran to Lawdar and there is no tension in the way described by 
certain media. I stress that anyone who wagers on the split of 
the country will lose. 
  [Al-Qallab] Certain Arab parties, particularly Jordan, have 
exerted efforts to contain the Yemeni crisis. Has there been a 
decision to invite some Arab leaders to attend the celebrations 
marking the meeting between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
the vice president? 
  [Al-Kuhali] We in the YSP welcome anyone who helped and 
supported us to attend these expected celebrations. Here I wish 
to underline the major role played by His Majesty King Husayn to 
protect the Yemeni unity and close the ranks. 
  [Al-Qallab] The YSP and its leaders have been accused of 
submitting to neighboring regional influences. What do you say? 
  [Al-Kuhali] One can understand that such things are said and 
used in political conflicts. These accusation are based on the 
fact that the other party has to defend itself against 
accusations of being out of touch with the age and rejecting the 
future. In all cases, these things have been said, but you know 
that such accusations exist in our Arab and Yemeni heritage. 
When we have a calamity we must attribute it to an enemy from 
outside or resolve it through a friend from outside. 
  I say that if we want to address our problems, then we must 
not take them to the outside. If the outside means the Gulf 
states, then the YSP is calling, emphatically, for new relations 
with these states on the basis of frankness, clarity, and common 
interests. We call for an Arab Peninsula free from 
confrontations or trenches. We do not wish to export ideology 
or slogans. We have to accept each other and coexist on clear 
basis and without subservience or submission. 
  [Al-Qallab] Is it true that the United States does not wish 
to see Yemen partitioned again? 
  [Al-Kuhali] Yes. We appreciate all the efforts that have 
been exerted to help us contain the crisis from the Arabs, 
Europe, and the United States. We welcome such efforts and 
roles.
