  [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn, may God preserve and 
protect him, has chaired a joint meeting of the Revolution 
Command Council [RCC] and the Council of Ministers. At the 
beginning of the meeting, his excellency the leader president 
explained the reasons for increasing the state's purchasing 
prices of wheat and rice crops from farmers, especially at an 
early stage of the agricultural season. His excellency said: 
The announcement of the price increases will encourage farmers 
to pay more attention to fertilization, irrigation, and the use 
of pesticides, which will increase the agricultural crop and 
will show farmers a clear horizon to reassure them about the 
fate of their products after harvesting. 
  His excellency said that it is a national, economic, and 
technical duty of every one in this stage--a duty which will 
remain a priority in the future--to continue to encourage 
farmers to increase their production because agriculture 
provides food for citizens. He said that providing food and 
persisting in efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in food is a 
vital part of national security that it should be followed up 
with interest. His excellency said that it is not a luxury for 
us to decide to increase the states' purchasing prices of the 
basis agricultural crops. It is necessary to study the increase 
in the state's purchasing prices for other crops, such as corn, 
and industrial products. 
  In light of the instructions of the leader president, may 
God 
preserve him, it has been decided to increase the purchasing 
prices of wheat and barley for the current agricultural season 
as follows: 
  1. Wheat: The current price of 1 tonne of first-class wheat 
is 5,000 dinars. The new price of 1 tonne is 8,000 dinars. The 
current price of 1 tonne of coarse wheat is 4,750 dinars. The 
new price of 1 tonne is 7,500 dinars. Regarding other kinds, 
the current price of 1 tonne is 4,500 dinars. The new price of 
1 tonne is 7,000 dinars. 
  2. Barley: The current price of 1 tonne is 2,500 dinars. 
The new price of 1 tonne is 4,000 dinars. 
  The joint meeting of the RCC and the Council of Ministers 
then discussed the current budget and the investment plan for 
1994. In this regard, the leader president stressed commitment 
to the requirements of the march, which will be crowned with 
victory, God willing, if the ministries do not confuse the 
immediate and existing projects and services with medium or 
long-range goals. His excellency said: What is important is 
that we should remain effective and manage our resources well in 
this stage, and that after this stage, new and wide horizons 
will be opened for us, God willing. 
  His excellency also explained that the importance of this 
stage comes from the fact that the evil aggressors have been 
exposed as boring and illogical before the whole. Therefore, 
continuing to exert our utmost energy in production; in 
maintaining machines, equipment, and material; and fighting 
dissipation will increase the people's patience and 
steadfastness. Decreasing expenditures in building and 
operating projects, as well as choosing the least costly ways 
and alternatives will mean an increase in the Iraqi dinar's 
value, regardless of the size of the increase. The minister or 
the manager, who succeeds in reducing the cost of a 1 billion 
dinar project to 450 million dinars, for example, will feel the 
sweetness of this result because he, in fact, will have 
contributed to defending the homeland and the people. 
  His excellency also stressed the importance of increasing 
transportation energy this year, as it is important in 
transporting agricultural crops, industrial products, and 
workers in all sectors. At the end of the discussions, the 
meeting endorsed the current budget and the investment plan for 
1994. The joint meeting was attended by several technical 
cadres of the industrial sector.

  [Text] The [pro-Iraq] Kurdistan Revolutionary Party [KRP] 
has hailed with deep pride and appreciation leader President 
Saddam Husayn and his wise and brave leadership of our great 
Iraqi people. In a statement issued at the end of its Central 
Committee meeting, the KRP reiterated that it would place all 
its energy, its masses, and its friends at leader President 
Saddam Husayn's disposal in defense of the people and the 
homeland. 
  In its final statement, the KRP Central Committee denounced 
the imperialist-Zionist conspiracy against Iraq, and urged the 
international community to shoulder its full legal, human, and 
moral responsibility to lift, immediately and unconditionally, 
the blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. 
  The Central Committee condemned the criminal, terrorist, and 
destructive plan of the foreigner's agents, led by Jalal 
Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani in Kurdistan, stressing support for 
the Kurdish masses' perpetual struggle and their heroic daily 
confrontation of the agents of the foreigners. The KRP also 
stressed its determination to defend Kurdish national rights 
against slogan traders and brokers of international politics, 
who have turned the Kurdish cause into a commodity for 
bargaining and cheap blackmail in order to achieve their evil 
intentions. It also pledged to defend the homeland and 
safeguard the achievements and gains, which the 17-30 July 
revolution has given to the Kurdish people under the leadership 
of leader President Saddam Husayn, foremost of which is the 
Autonomous Region law. 
  The Central Committee emphasized the KRP's solidarity with 
the Palestinian Arab people to enable them to determine their 
fate and it denounced the American and the Zionist role in 
liquidating the Palestine question. It condemned the 
foreigners' occupation of Somalia, as well as the Egyptian 
regime's criminal positions against the Egyptian militant 
popular forces, and stressed the KRP's solidarity with the 
Yemeni people. It also said in its final statement that the 
Arab nation has no choice but unity and economic integration to 
confront all foreign challenges. 
  The KRP then warned the international community in general 
and the Arab nation in particular of the serious role U.S. 
imperialism is playing to control the world economy, and 
appealed to the international community to work to end the 
imperialist hegemony over the international organization.

  [Text] An ambush group belonging to the Islamic resistance 
forces last week carried out an operation targeted on 'Awdah 
'Atwan, a criminal belonging to the regime's intelligence organ. 
Our sources noted that the operation, which took place in the 
village of (Abu Hudaydah) in the Governorate of al-'Amarah 
resulted in the death of the above-mentioned person; his 
personal weapons were seized. Criminal 'Awdah 'Atwan is known 
by the residents of Abu Hudaydah and al-'Amarah marshlands as 
someone who sold his conscience and humanity to tyrant Saddam's 
regime. In doing so, he committed the ugliest crimes and 
attacks against innocent citizens. He personally executed three 
innocent citizens. 
  Last week, the Islamic resistance forces set up an ambush in 
one of the sensitive points along the road between the district 
of al-Majarr and the subdistrict of Nahr 'Udayl in the 
Governorate of al-'Amarah. Our sources in the south said that 
the ambushers succeeded in attacking a military vehicle [word 
indistinct] transporting some regime forces along the 
above-mentioned road. The attack destroyed the vehicle and 
killed or injured all those inside it. Our sources noted that 
the resistance men found identity cards and documents on the 
bodies of the regime's men proving that the destroyed vehicle 
belonged to the 1st Company of the 3d Regiment of the 704th 
Brigade, which is deployed in the marshlands of al-'Amarah. 
  The Islamic resistance forces returned safely to their 
bases. 
It later became clear that the regime had placed its forces in 
a state of alert and patrolled the road with armored vehicles.

rely on firm principles, which are based on respect for existing 
regimes and borders and noninterference in internal affairs.

interference, which sought to disrupt good relations with 
fraternal Eritrea. He stressed that there was a need to be wary

  [Report by 'Atif al-Ghamri in London] 
  [Text] Aldu Aju, deputy speaker of the Sudanese parliament 
[name and title as published], who announced his dissent from 
the Sudanese Government and asked for political asylum in 
Britain, has revealed the secrets behind transforming Sudan into 
a center for extremists from outside Sudan. He publicized the 
covert methods the Sudanese Government has resorted to to 
mislead the world about the locations and nature of training 
programs for terrorists inside Sudan. 
  In an interview with AL-AHRAM, Aldu clarified that at the 
beginning of the coup in 1989, the al-Bashir government's 
dealings with the international terrorist organizations inside 
Sudan used to be public. However, Sudan started to come under 
regional and international pressure and decided to resort to 
secrecy. 
  He highlighted the fact that all these activities take place 
under the control of al-Turabi's front, which is called the 
Islamic Front, that he will be talking from a position of 
authority, and that what he says are things he has seen for 
himself. 
  Aldu said: Their method of secrecy made them set up 
locations on the outskirts of Khartoum, which are private farms 
where training takes place. In addition, training takes place 
in mosques, where people usually come to pray. The extremists 
also show up among the crowds in the mosque, but they stay on 
until the training and guidance courses start. These go on 
until 0400. Iranians and other people from Arab countries do the 
training. 
  He added that the second method is to have public training 
centers for popular defense programs in numerous locations such 
as Jazirat Aba, Juba, and Danqilah. He said: For example, 
26,000 mujahid fighters were publicly graduated from training 
camps for popular defense in Jazirat Aba on 11 December 1992. 
He noted that to mislead people, secret training operations for 
terrorists take place as part of this public training. Aldu 
said: Extremists from Iran, Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], and other Islamic and Arab countries take part in 
these operations. Recently, some extremists from African 
countries were added to them, but their general guidance comes 
from Iran. 
  The third method is to set up what is called the 
"international friendship council" which is chaired by al-Bashir 
himself and is based in Khartoum. Its public duty is to support 
the relations of friendship with other people. But the reality 
is that this council is a tool through which contacts with all 
terrorist groups in the Arab world and Africa are maintained. 
  On the Sudanese people's stand on these operations, Aldu 
said 
that all job opportunities are doled out to those who undergo 
training that is under the control of the Islamic Front led by 
al- Turabi. He pointed out that the Front has organized a 
six-month training program in which each group of Sudanese is 
sent to Iran for training and returns after six months. After 
that, a second group is sent for another six months' training 
period. 
  Aldu Aju added that after their return to Sudan these 
individuals are distributed among the army, police, economic 
establishments, and embassies abroad, noting that all Sudanese 
diplomats are trained in Iran. 
  On the Sudanese people's attitude toward Egypt, Aju said: 
The Sudanese people want to resolve every dispute with Egypt, 
as relations between the two peoples are long-standing. Egypt 
must be interested in Sudanese events, Aju noted, saying that 
Egypt cannot just sit and look on. He said that Sudan is 
governed by one extremist party. He noted that the regime in 
Khartoum does not trust Sudanese national principles. It 
imports principles of violence and terrorism from abroad and 
acts to destabilize the entire region. Egypt, he said, is the 
largest force in the region and the Sudanese respect Egypt. 
  Aju said: The international friendship council is 
responsible for foreign policy in Sudan and all the things that 
the Sudanese foreign minister says regarding the negotiations to 
solve differences with Egypt will not lead to an agreement. He 
further noted that foreign policy in Sudan is not run by the 
foreign minister. 
  On the Khartoum government's foreign policy, Aju said that 
the Sudanese Government does not deal with governments but with 
extremists. It has no good ties with any neighboring Arab or 
African country but is trying to act in these countries against 
the governments and cited Ethiopia as an example. He said that 
this behavior affects Sudan's relations with the Arab world, 
Africa, and the whole world. 
  Aju noted that those who attended the Arab Islamic peoples 
conference that was held in Khartoum recently are extremists who 
came from Arab, Islamic, African, Asian, and even American 
countries. It was noted that the statements made at the 
conference were not critical but extremist. He pointed out that 
if religion had really been behind this behavior, Sudan would 
better have maintained good ties with Egypt because Egypt is the 
home of al- Azhar Mosque, which will never be secular. He noted 
that the events in Sudan are not motivated by religion but 
politics. He said that the Sudanese people are opposed to this 
state of affairs, but what can they do when rifles are directed 
at them and they are surrounded by security, spying, and 
intellectual suppression agencies and faced with the Islamic 
Front's control of livelihood, finance, and trade? Summing up 
the situation in Sudan, he said: Sudan is a state that has 
collapsed after the al-Bashir government destroyed the economy 
and all the state's departments. War in the south is 
exacerbating the destruction and the collapse is worsening.

<F P=106> ['Uthman Mirghani report: "Al-Mahdi Rejects al-Turabi's </F>
Offer of Reconciliation and Merger of the Two Parties"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- Informed Sudanese sources have 
revealed that Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, secretary general of the 
Sudanese National Islamic Front [NIF], has paid a visit to 
al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, former prime minister and leader of the Ummah 
Party, in an attempt to persuade him agree to a reconciliation 
with the regime. 
  The sources said that Dr. al-Turabi made al-Mahdi "an 
astounding offer" expressing willingness to meet all the Ummah 
Party's demands if the latter agreed to merge with the NIF. 
  They added that al-Mahdi rejected the offer and told 
al-Turabi that the NIF cannot escape accountability and 
answerability for the harm done to the country. 
  Ummah Party sources contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT have 
confirmed these facts and said that non-Sudanese parties with 
NIF links also contacted al-Mahdi to persuade him to enter into 
a dialogue that would lead to a reconciliation with the regime 
but he refused to discuss the matter and submitted documents and 
facts showing the magnitude of the damage inflicted on the 
country over the past four years, pointing out that the NIF was 
responsible for that. 
  The Ummah Party sources said that al-Turabi admitted that 
the 
internal situation had reached a dead end. They also said that 
NIF officials who were members of the Sudanese Government's 
delegation to the second Abuja round of negotiations offered 
Garang's movement the option of merger with the NIF in one party 
but that was rejected by the movement on the grounds of vast 
differences between the views of the two sides. [passage 
omitted] 
  Meanwhile, the Sudanese capital Khartoum is suffering from 
an 
acute fuel shortage leading to the reduction of the ration for 
taxi drivers to one gallon a day. There has also been a severe 
bread crisis in Khartoum for the past two weeks. Furthermore, 
circles close to the government have admitted that there is also 
a liquidity crisis which has delayed payment of the salaries of 
the government employees and members of the armed forces.

<F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at the opening </F>
session of the General People's Congress in Surt--live] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God. First of all, good morning 
to all of you. On the basis of an invitation from the General 
People's Congress [GPC] secretariat, I have come to attend this 
opening session. However, my fear is that foreign journalists 
and some observers might think that the GPC is a parliament and 
that I am a president. They are used to the traditional protocol 
whereby the head of state chairs the opening session of 
parliament. [passage omitted] 
  Regrettably, there are those who purposely practice 
blackouts 
on the people's authority and the people's direct democracy as 
part of the war against small peoples' aspirations and their 
attempts to liberate themselves, and as a way of belittling 
peoples by insisting that only big powers can impose their 
views, and that anything other than that is dictatorship. There 
are some hirelings who are paid to write and talk with a view to 
smearing people's authority. [passage omitted] 
  Other countries should take this experiment from us and 
benefit from it by learning from the Libyan people. Instead, 
they ridicule us from their arrogant, imperialist, and 
disdainful stands. Normally, they should encourage a small 
people seeking liberation. On the contrary, they are hostile to 
the Libyan people and deride their experiment, so much so that 
they do not talk about the people's congresses. 
  You have journalists here. Wait and see what they will 
write. They will not refer to the people's congresses and the 
people's authority. First, they will say the Libyan parliament. 
Then, some will say people's committees, and this is very 
deceitful. [passage omitted] 
  We are exposing the rancor and ill intentions of the Western 
colonialist powers and their lackeys, the hireling newspapers 
and agent rulers. We just want to expose them so that the 
people will read these newspapers and listen to the radios and 
laugh at them--the Voice of America, for example, when it says 
al-Qadhdhafi the dictator. This is a great country, supposed to 
be respectable, and peoples are expected to listen to its radio. 
When a Libyan listens to the Voice of America he falls on his 
back laughing when he hears it talk about al-Qadhdhafi, the 
Libyan dictator. 
  Thank God, this is a privilege and a blessing enjoyed by us 
Libyans in this country--love and brotherhood, and this is the 
unbeatable force with which we face up to the enemies. They 
have now realized that for Libya to be defeated, several million 
people, four or five million Libyans must first be defeated, one 
by one. But in other countries, if they topple a president then 
that is it, perhaps the people... [pauses] or they could incite 
a people against a president, or cause the defeat of a party in 
elections, forge elections and bring in another party against 
it, involve people in the farce of pluralism, bring economic 
pressure to bear against them, and threaten them militarily so 
as to cause the fall of a ruler, a government, or a party. 
[passage omitted] This would not exist in Libya where there is 
no foundation for it, because in Libya there is neither party, 
nor sect, nor ruler, nor government. 
  These facts give strength to the Libyan side. They give us 
determination and self-confidence that we will win in any 
confrontation, and they undermine the will of the enemies. 
[passage omitted] We are determined to enter into a 
confrontation and we are 100 percent confident in victory in the 
end, no matter how long the battle may be, and it should be 
long. [applause] [passage omitted] We would have thought, after 
the insignificant Reagan, that the American administration--the 
current republic or democracy--we, and all reasonable people, 
would have thought that, had there been a conscience in this 
world, America would apologize to the Libyan people and to the 
families of the innocent victims--children and women in Benghazi 
and Tripoli--that it would give compensation to those who accept 
it, and be sorry for all its life toward the Libyans and mankind 
for having committed a horrible barbaric massacre against 
children in 1986. On the contrary, here they are, forgetting 
all this and pursuing us again, threatening us, laying siege 
to us, and seeking more human victims. This means that 
conscience is dead. This is a dangerous moral decline in the 
world and in big powers. [passage omitted] 
  They are holding us responsible for Lockerbie--the Pan-Am 
crash--as if our sons who died in 1986 were mice, and your sons 
are human beings. What is our link with an airplane that 
crashed in the North Pole? Even if we did this, they should 
still be ashamed and keep quiet. They should say: we killed the 
Libyans' sons in their sleep. It was a mistake. Reagan was 
crazy and insignificant. He did a great deal of harm to the 
American reputation in the world. He committed a horrible crime 
that made America speechless and very embarrassed. Let us turn 
a blind eye to Lockerbie even if the Libyans are behind it. 
Despite the fact that we did not do it, they are still after 
us. They are holding us responsible no matter what. [passage 
omitted] 
  The UN Security Council asked Libya to cooperate with a 
French investigation and Libya expressed its readiness to 
cooperate with the French investigation and informed France. 
France refused the investigation out of solidarity and linked 
the UTA issue to the Lockerbie question. What is the link 
between UTA in Niger and Pan-Am at Lockerbie? 
  France does not want a solution and took a stance which 
contradicts that of the UN Security Council. If there were a 
real UN Security Council which was not under Western hegemony, 
it would meet and pass a resolution against France, declare 
Libya not guilty, and drop this aspect from the resolutions and 
the issue, considering that Libya has fulfilled its commitments 
toward France and it is the latter that refused. After that the 
council would have to condemn France. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday, Dr. Swire, the chairman of the Association of the 
Lockerbie Airliner Victims, made a proposal and said that The 
Hague was an approriate place for the trial, and should the 
English want to hold this trial, let them move to The Hague. 
This is the chairman of the Lockerbie victims association who 
said this. 
  They are telling the world: We, the U.S. and UK Governments, 
are under pressure from the Lockerbie victims association, at a 
time when the chairman of the Lockerbie victims association is 
saying before the world: I am not obstinately attached to a 
trial in Scotland, and even The Hague is an appropriate place. 
So, their argument is no longer valid. 
  Should someone claim responsibility for Lockerbie now, they 
would not be able to recognize their mistake. Because they have 
already involved the Security Council against Libya, it would 
not be able to deal with an unidentified criminal. Let us 
suppose that one person was involved in the Pan-Am explosion 
over Lockerbie, they would obliterate all the facts, because 
this would put them in a very embarrassing position. How could 
the Security Council be involved in an issue because it was told 
that a country was behind it, and all of sudden an unidentified 
person claims responsibility for this act? How could the 
Security Council issue resolutions against this person? Would 
it deprive him of spare parts? Would it break off diplomatic 
relations with him, with Carlos for example? The Security 
Council would become a joke in this case. Consequently, no 
matter how much evidence there might be, the Security Council 
would not heed them, on the orders of the Western countries, so 
that they would not get into difficulties in front of the world. 
It must be Libya. Even if another country were proved to be 
involved, they would not admit it. It must be Libya. 
  This is what made the Libyan people angry; this is what made 
them revolt, and prepare for confrontation. This issue has 
become one of defiance, confrontation, and blatant injustice 
which can only be met with resistance. [passage omitted] 
  There is yet another factor that had prompted the Libyan 
people to engage in revolution. Now they are saying that the 
Libyan people are escalating the crisis, al-Qadhdhafi is 
escalating the crisis. Indeed we have been more patient than 
Job. There is a saying which says: Job's patience is adoration 
of God, and a fools' patience is silly. We have been patient 
for a long time, and it is you [the West] that are escalating 
the crisis. [passage omitted] After all this patience, 
perseverance, give and take, our brandishing an olive branch, 
cordiality, and even courting of the Western states, they 
surprised us with Resolution 883 or I do not know which number. 
Then they say the Libyans are escalating the crisis. But why 
you are escalating the crisis? What do you want? 
  Yesterday, the UN commissioner told our foreign secretary: 
you are escalating, and this is unsettling. But you, for your 
part, are not you escalating? Very nice, you want us to retreat 
while you escalate the crisis. So long as there is escalation 
we must face up to escalation, and so long as there is 
confrontation we must face up to confrontation. The Libyan 
people have been wronged and must confront and resist 
wrongdoing. [applause] 
  What made the Libyan people angry too was something at the 
pan- Arab level. Brothers, these days we are hearing a slogan 
being raised and we are required to carry it out. It is very 
grave. It is the slogan of land for peace. This is the gravest 
slogan. This misleads the revolution from Syria to Mauritania, 
not just in Libya. O Arabs, the slogan of land for peace is 
grave. It means that it legitimizes and permits occupation for 
the realization of other objectives: you occupy land and then 
pose the condition you want. If you meet their condition they 
give you the land back. This is very serious. [passage omitted] 
  This is the gravest of slogans. The slogan of land for peace 
is the gravest of slogans and it must be torn up even at the 
price of millions of Arabs and a sea of blood. This slogan 
should be torn asunder. It is a very serious slogan as far as 
the future of the Arab nation is concerned. Land for peace? 
First, according to the UN Charter acquisition of land by 
force is not permitted. Therefore, the Jews have no right to 
occupy Sinai or the Golan or southern Lebanon. They should 
withdraw from these territories unconditionally. This was 
approved by the world from the first day--the world said that 
there should be an unconditional withdrawal. The withdrawal from 
Sinai, the Golan, and southern Lebanon has no connection at all 
with the question of Palestine. 
  They should withdraw from Egyptian territories 
unconditionally; the enemy should withdraw from the territories 
of Syria, otherwise Syria should fight this enemy to make it 
withdraw unconditionally--either Syria fights this enemy or this 
enemy withdraws from Syrian territories. This has no relation 
whatever with recognition at all. The same applies to southern 
Lebanon. With regard to the West Bank, this is part of Jordan. 
Gaza is part of Egypt. In 1967 some Egyptian territories were 
occupied--Sinai including Gaza. Gaza belongs to Egypt. 
Throughout the years it belonged to Egypt. It was not 
Palestinian land before 1967. It is Egyptian territory. The 
West Bank belongs to Jordan as far as the armistice line. It 
was occupied when it was Jordanian territory in 1967. 
  The same thing applies to the Golan--it is Syrian territory 
which was occupied. Therefore it is the right of Syria, Jordan, 
and Egypt to unconditionally retrieve their territories because 
they were occupied by force. They will be supported in this by 
the entire world. It is serious when someone deliberately 
intends to occupy your land in order to impose conditions on 
you. This is very serious. The Palestinian question has not 
been solved; no one has touched it, either in Gaza, or in 
Jericho, or anywhere else. Jericho is a spot in the West Bank 
and the latter belongs to Jordan and was occupied in 1967. 
Jordan has the right to demand unconditionally all its 
territories which were occupied in 1967. Syria should insist on 
the return of the Golan unconditionally. This has no connection 
whatsoever with the Palestinian question because the Palestinian 
question existed and the struggle for it existed long before the 
occupation of the Golan. Sinai was occupied while the 
Palestinian question was in existence; the question had no 
connection whatever with the occupation of Sinai. The 
Palestinian question has existed since 1948 and before, while 
Sinai and the Golan were occupied in 1967. Lebanon was occupied 
recently--in 1982, or what? Yesterday they occupied southern 
Lebanon. It has nothing to do with the question of Palestine. 
Tomorrow they may say: who has not recognized us? Libya, 
Algeria, Iraq, Sudan, and so on. They have not recognized us. 
All right, go and occupy part of their territories. Land for 
peace--we give you your land which we occupied and you establish 
peace with us. This is very serious. I am astonished--and I 
call on the Ba'th Party which is ruling Syria--this pan-Arab 
party for the sake of which people were imprisoned and young 
people lost their future in the 1960's, while people died for 
it; it used to be the party raising the banner of Arab 
nationalism. It was the one which fought in Palestine. 
It is not possible that the end of the Syrian Ba'th Party would 
be recognition of Israel in exchange for the Golan. The Golan 
should be returned either through the United Nations or through 
war. The Syrian people have the right to fight to recover the 
Golan. [passage omitted] 
  The Libyan people are ready to embark upon a long battle. By 
God, even if we all die we will not accept this injustice; we do 
not accept land for peace or the recognition of Israel at all. 
We recognize the democratic Palestinian State which encompasses 
Jews and Arabs. Israel is an innovation which we do not know, 
the Israeli world does not exist in geography. [passage 
omitted]. 
  Brother ambassadors, tell the rulers who now are racing to 
embrace Israelis and please the West that they might regret it; 
perhaps America will blow up like the Soviet Union and you might 
get up one morning and not find it there. Anything is possible 
to God, and he can do this. We only believe in God who has the 
power. [applause] 
  You might get what happened to those who were worshipping 
Moscow and were saying: The great Soviet Union, the red 
universe, the red flag will cover the earth and there is nothing 
but Marxism-Leninism. The god of the Soviet Union died; the poor 
people became orphans looking for someone to protect them. They 
asked for God's forgiveness saying that they were not 
communists. [passage omitted] Have no fear as your enemy, in 
the first place, is an exploiting capitalist who will collapse. 
Do not say that this enemy is on the ascendant. The enemy is 
descending. It is on its deathbed. The entire West is 
experiencing death. It is covered with a thick cover but it is 
collapsing from within. [passage omitted ] Your enemy is made 
of glass and will break and destroy itself. 
  There is now a struggle for Serbia. They are divided over 
Serbia. It may appear to be a dangerous struggle and break-up 
in Europe over Serbia, beginning with Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Naturally the issue does not concern Bosnia-Herzegovina. All 
the others are in agreement regarding the liquidation of the 
Muslims. All of them--Russia, America, and so on --have decided 
not to recognize a Muslim people in Europe; Europe is 100 
percent Christian--this is what they have decided. 
  As for the Arabs, they should accept a Jewish state in 
Muscat and a racist Israeli state at that, armed with nuclear 
weapons. America is pursuing North Korea and says to it: We 
should inspect your installations; you should not have nuclear 
weapons. Why does not America pursue the Israelis who have more 
than 200 nuclear warheads? These are the things which make the 
Libyan people angry. He who does not become angry is without 
conscience; he is a slave. Anyone seeing this arrogance would 
get angry. Is it logical to see them pursuing Korea and 
leaving the Israelis? They should pursue all those who have 
nuclear weapons. Look at the racist policy. When they saw 
South Africa becoming a black country, they began to [word 
indistinct] its nuclear capability. When the whites had that 
country they turned a blind eye to it although they knew that it 
was about to manufacture nuclear weapons. [passage omitted] 
  Recently they came to Egypt and said that that country 
should 
sign a treaty banning the manufacturing of chemical weapons. 
Egypt told them that the Israelis have not signed anything, not 
even the treaty banning the proliferation of nuclear weapons, 
and now you are asking us to sign the treaty banning the 
manufacture of chemical weapons. I do not sign. If there is a 
state most feared by the Israelis it is Egypt. Egypt was the 
first Arab state to recognize the Israelis and so on, but the 
real cultural defiance felt by Egypt is not felt by any other 
Arab country. Egypt knows that along its border there is a 
traditional enemy. [passage omitted] 
  Take American justice and this young man Clinton; he is a 
good man and a man of peace--he does not hate anyone in the 
world, but the poor man must believe the policies the Americans 
are involving us in when they tell him to go after Libya, or 
Korea, or wherever, because they have nuclear weapons. Who 
believes him if he does not pursue the Israelis? No matter how 
good he may be, the poor man is the victim of the imperialist 
policy; they treat him as they did Kennedy. They may get rid of 
this poor man as they did Kennedy. If he does not go along with 
them they will get rid of him. 
  The CIA, the American Central Intelligence Agency--I hope 
someone brave will come along one day and disband and destroy 
it. It is this that sabotaged the world; this notorious agency 
has brought the United States into disrepute and the whole world 
into disrepute. It has undermined the world. It is like 
woodworm and poison. It played havoc with governments and 
regimes and the economy, the dollar, and currencies and 
everything. It is behind the undermining of the entire world. 
One hopes that a brave man will come along and do something and 
deliver America and the American people and the world of this 
nightmare called CIA. It has spread its nets everywhere. You 
are aware of all this. Your sons might be among those caught in 
these nets. Everyone in this whole world is worried about his 
children lest they get caught in the CIA's nets. The CIA is 
like a deadly disease. The CIA forges money, the dollar, and 
the currencies of the whole world. It has long arms and it has 
devilish plots. [passage omitted] How can Clinton escape from 
it, the poor man? How can he free himself of it, no matter how 
good a man he may be or how much he is a man of peace? How can 
he get rid of this nightmare short of dissolving it? If he did 
this, he would be able to breathe easy. 
  There are some imperialist quarters which are very, very 
dangerous and against freedom and peace. They are to be found 
in America and the West and are more powerful than Clinton, more 
powerful than his administration, and more powerful than anyone 
who loves peace. If Abraham Lincoln or George Washington came 
back to life they would be powerless unless they destroyed and 
dismantled these nightmares. [passage omitted] 
  The same applies to America. If the National Security 
Council is not dismantled, and the White House which is like the 
Kremlin and the CIA which is like the KGB, no one, not the 
American people, will be liberated. What kind of freedom is 
this when they have these organizations? It is all lies if they 
say that have a free people, a free press. It is all lies. 
These claims are continually made by the West. They are the 
dictatorial regimes. Yet they accuse us of dictatorship. 
  Generally, they are beating the drums of confrontation with 
us. And not only with the Libyan people but with all the East. 
They are getting ready for a crusade. You must know that, 
after the end of communism, they decided to terminate Islam, the 
East, and the Arab nation. That is the gist of it. 
  They changed their tactics. They were confronting the Soviet 
Union, confrontation in Berlin, and now it has shifted to Rome. 
It has become North and South. It has become East and West. 
The East means the Islamic East--that is, the Arabs, or rather 
the Arabs first. The front line is the Arabs. The Arabs must 
be attacked and destroyed. Afterward they will go deep into 
Asia and all those countries. All their actions and their 
"Satanic Verses" have a great significance. We must not meet 
Abu Nidal or Ahmad Jibril. I very much regret that they have 
not accepted the invitation for them to come over here. They 
are supposed to accept the invitation and come so that I can 
meet them publicly. They are meeting with the leaders of the 
IRA and yet they forbid us to do so. They receive the author of 
"The Satanic Verses" who insulted Islam. Today they are making 
dancing dresses with Koranic verses printed on them in France or 
the nightclubs of France. One wonders if the Arabs or those who 
are defenders of Islam would protest to France or break off 
relations with France. They would not dare. [passage omitted] 
  We are warning the Egyptian people against those who have 
opened fire, the Algerian people against those who have opened 
fire, the Sudanese people against those who have been opening 
fire, the Lebanese people who are being trampled on, the 
Palestinian people who are being treated like a flock of sheep, 
and the Syrian people whose land is being occupied until it 
recognizes them. Tomorrow they will occupy Damascus so that they 
can impose more conditions on the Syrian people. We are warning 
all these people. 
  They destroyed Iraq and it was they who got Iraq into the 
Kuwaiti mess. It was they who destroyed Kuwait, and 
particularly Kuwait's oil. It was not even Saddam who set fire 
to Kuwait's oil. It was set on fire by America. All the 
technology which was used in burning Kuwaiti oil was Western 
technology. It was deliberate and intentional. They were the 
ones who set it on fire. They collaborated with Iraq, provided 
it with experts, gave it the capabilities, and told Saddam to 
set Kuwaiti oil on fire for reasons which concerned only them. 
Iraq would need a whole year to be able to set Kuwaiti oil on 
fire. It was a Western and an American action. It was 
intentional. It was America who plotted for Iraq's occupation 
of Kuwait. It told Iraq: In order to reward you for your war 
against Khomeyni we reward you with Kuwait. Take Kuwait. All 
this in order to destroy Iraq. These things are quite clear. 
  We are determined to live with dignity over our land. We can 
never accept living on this earth while we are lacking in 
sovereignty. One of us is a slave and the other is a master. 
We will fight this. We prefer death to acceptance of being 
their slaves, or surrendering to them, or allowing them to 
impose their injustice on us. Right is turned into wrong and 
vice versa. 
  They want to solve the Lockerbie case; there are a hundred 
solutions on the table. [passage omitted] 
  They can go wherever they wish to go. We have decided that 
we do not need the oil. Oil has now become like any other 
commodity. Today we are selling a barrel of oil at $10 while 
production costs are $6 per barrel. It means that a barrel of 
oil brings in $4. This is nothing. What can we do with $4? 
Today we are more or less living without oil because a barrel 
of oil is worth $4. [passage omitted] If we sell the water of 
the great man-made river we get double the price of the oil. 
  France does not want a solution. So be it. They do not want 
friendship. Let there be hatred. They do not want peace; let 
peace go to hell. What are we? Are we more desirous of peace 
or friendship than they are? What is our relationship with them 
? We do not need them. That is it. We have decided definitely 
to do without oil. If it continued, well and good, and if it 
did not--definitely we have made our decision to live without 
oil and live in the manner that suits us. 
  Today, we have electricity and this and that and air 
conditioning units; they must not think our independence and our 
freedom are dependent on them. When it comes to the real thing 
and the issue becomes an issue of dignity and an issue of 
existence and an issue of the future and they want on encroach 
on us, to hell with all these things. We shall go back to back 
to burning logs and do away with electricity [words indistinct 
drowned by applause] [passage omitted]. 
  Now they are asking why Libya has been escalating the 
situation. They are doing so because they are afraid that such 
an escalation would spread to other Arab countries and other 
peoples. 
  What they would like to see is that when they attack the 
rest 
should surrender. Once there is someone who says no, there 
should be no surrender, others might follow suit. They might 
say: Look, here is someone who has not surrendered; why then 
should we surrender?. And thus a new awakening might begin. 
  Yes, we should be exporting our people's revolution to the 
rest of the Arab nation because a sin is being committed there. 
First, the slogan Land for Peace must be burned. All right, 
peace requires a price so let us motivate the Arab nation to pay 
the price. Here we are not warmongers, as they have been 
claiming, nor are we calling for the destruction of Israel or 
anything like that. 
  However, the word Israel is a strange name which we do not 
comprehend. What we know is Palestine; Jews and Arabs should 
live in Palestine in a democratic state. We said this before. 
Peaceful solutions should mean, furthermore, that nuclear 
weapons and weapons of mass destruction must be removed from the 
Israelis. A democratic state, like that in South Africa, must 
be created; we should organize free elections and allow the 7 
million Palestinians to return because as long as the 7 million 
have not returned there will be no solution to this problem. 
  The Golan is, however, another problem; it is Syria's right 
to demand its return or to fight until its land has been 
liberated. But no one should ask it to recognize Israel at all. 
Syria has every right to liberate the Golan inch by inch and no 
one has any right to ask it to recongnize Israel. This is its 
land; it was occupied in 1967. What is dangerous here is 
linking the two things together. [passage omitted] 
  I would like here to salute the Libyan people for their 
pan-Arabism and for understanding the aims of the plot, as well 
as for their readiness for confrontation. We have no other 
choice than a confrontation; we have no choices left. But if 
they are looking for a solution with us they are welcome. If 
they choose peace we will reciprocate. Peace be upon you.

  [Text] Surt, 23 Jan (MENA)--Abu-Zayd 'Umar Durdah, 
secretary of the General People's Committee--a title equivalent 
to prime minister--has praised Egypt's role and President 
Mubarak's sincere attempts to support Libya and ease the 
blockade imposed on it. 
  In a statement to journalists today, Durdah said cooperation 
with Egypt continues in all fields, especially the security 
field, noting that Egypt's security is also Libya's security. 
  On the fate of [kidnapped former foreign minister] Mansur 
al-Kihya, Durdah stressed that this issue is nothing but a 
suspicious attempt to undermine Egyptian-Libyan relations and to 
complete the blockade imposed on Libya. 
  Durdah did not play down the effects of the UN Security 
Council sanctions on the Libyan economy. He said Libya is now 
preparing its budget, taking these sanctions into consideration. 
In its own way it is trying to maintain the defense allocations 
and subsidies for next year the same as they were in last year's 
budget. 
  The General People's Congress committees have continued 
their 
discussions for the second day to draft and prepare the 
resolutions of the basic people's congresses. These resolutions 
will be announced tomorrow, while the final session of the 
General People's Congress will be held on Tuesday [25 January].

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Usamah al-Baz, Foreign 
Ministry first under secretary and director of the President's 
Office for Political Affairs, said that President Husni Mubarak 
and President 'Arafat today reviewed the PLO-Israeli 
negotiations in Oslo, the progress made in the Taba talks, and 
ways to achieve further progress on a formula to implement the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  Commenting on the Palestinian-Israeli talks, al-Baz said 
obviously the climate in which the talks are conducted has 
improved and become positive and that agreement between the two 
sides is likely in the next few weeks. 
  For his part, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian side 
in the Taba talks, said after his meeting today with Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa and Dr. Usamah al-Baz that important talks to 
overcome obstacles delaying an agreement on Gaza and Jericho, 
especially differences on the crossings and Jericho, were held 
after President 'Arafat's visit to Oslo and his meeting with the 
Israeli foreign minister. 
  Sha'th added that President 'Arafat briefed President 
Mubarak 
on developments in Oslo and discussed future steps with him. 
Sha'th said that President Mubarak invited the Palestinian 
delegation to a working breakfast with President 'Arafat. 
Presidents Mubarak and 'Arafat then asked the Palestinian 
delegation to meet with 'Amr Musa and Dr. al-Baz to continue 
discussion of a plan for a joint move to resolve the problems. 
  Sha'th affirmed that Egypt is exerting efforts, as it has 
been since the start of the negotiations, to resolve outstanding 
problems. 
  The head of the Palestinian side on the Gaza-Jericho 
Committee said that the latest talks in Taba saw a serious, 
objective attempt to break the deadlock. He added: We 
submitted a paper in Taba that was the subject of discussion in 
Oslo, and thus, the attempt to break the deadlock began in Taba 
and continued in Oslo and then in Cairo. 
  Sha'th said he will return to Taba after tomorrow, Tuesday, 
to resume negotiations with General Shahaq, who will be briefed 
by then on Shim'on Peres' view of the talks that were held with 
'Arafat in Oslo. He added that talks on the civilian authority 
will be resumed in Taba tomorrow. 
  He said that President 'Arafat will meet Shim'on Peres in 
Davos, Switzerland, on Sunday [30 January] and expressed his 
belief that the Davos meeting will help lead to an agreement 
soon. Sha'th added that no time has yet been fixed for a 
meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin.

  [Text] Cairo -- AL-ITTIHAD AL-USBU'I -- Informed Egyptian 
sources have affirmed that Egyptian Information Minister Safwat 
al-Sharif's recent mission to Libya was to inform Colonel 
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi that Cairo apologizes that it cannot 
welcome him for talks with President Husni Mubarak before it is 
confirmed that Libya has nothing to do with the disappearance of 
Libyan opposition figure Masnur al-Kikhya, who disappeared in 
Cairo in unclear circumstances. 
  Last week, al-Qadhdhafi again asked to visit Cairo or 
al-Sallum to remove the misunderstanding between his country and 
Egypt because of the al-Khikya incident. 
  In his message, al-Qadhdhafi renewed his offer to mediate 
between Egypt and Sudan and to host an Egyptian-Sudanese summit 
in Tripoli. 
  The Egyptian information minister told him that the Egyptian 
and Sudanese foreign ministers are holding contacts to resolve 
controversial issues between the two countries, and that any 
future summit depends on the success of the expected meeting 
between the two foreign ministers. 
  Safwat al-Sharif also informed Libyan officials that the 
Egyptian Government categorically refuses to deport Libyan 
opposition activists in Cairo because they have not violated the 
terms of political asylum granted to them. Libya had proposed 
that the opposition activists be deported from Cairo to avoid 
any tension their presence might cause to Egyptian-Libyan 
relations. 
  Egypt last week refused to welcome the senior Libyan 
official, al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi, who requested to visit Cairo 
during his recent presence in Tunis.

  [Text] Cairo, 21 Jan (MENA)--The Higher State Security 
prosecutor today questioned wounded terrorist Muhammad Ahmad 
Farhan, who is currently under guard at the al-Qasr al-'Ayni 
Hospital after taking part in the al-Ma'sarah incident on 
Wednesday. 
  The terrorist confessed that his fugitive colleague Tharwat 
Hajjaj is the leader of their organization, which is made up of 
12 persons. It was Hajjaj who planned for him and his terrorist 
colleague Sami Isma'il Salih the attacks on the Majidah and 
al-Marwah movie theaters, the attack on a tourist bus in Misr 
al-Qadimah, and the assassination of police Brigadier General 
Ahmad Sha'lan, he added. 
  The terrorist confessed that his colleague Hajjaj had been 
present with them in the apartment and taken part in throwing 
bombs at security troops, then he took his wife and three 
children and fled. He pointed out that his colleague Sami 
Isma'il Salih had been responsible for conveying instructions 
from Afghanistan to the defendants as well as recruiting new and 
young members. 
  Wounded terrorist Farhan added that he had joined the 
organization five years ago; that he is a follower of Dr. 'Umar 
'Abd-al-Rahman; and that he holds the belief that this society 
and regime are blasphemous. He noted that four members of 
Islamic groups had been frequenting the apartment in al-Ma'sarah 
to help prepare the bombs to be used in the operations. He 
confessed that he had taken part in the Zinhum incident, which 
was intended to assassinate some figures, and that he had 
committed 25 terrorist acts. 
  The prosecutor ordered the speedy arrest of defendant 
Tharwat 
Hajjaj as well as the four other defendants who frequented the 
al-Ma'sarah apartment.

  [Text] Suspect Sami Salih, who was arrested in connection 
with the al-Ma'sarah incident Wednesday, has confessed that he 
is a member of a terrorist organization consisting of about 15 
people and led by terrorist Tharwat Hajjaj. 
  The suspect told the Higher State Security Prosecution today 
that he conveyed instructions from some leading elements in 
Afghanistan to his colleagues. 
  He said he took part in the attack against the Majidah and 
al-Marwah movie houses in Hulwan, the attack on a tourist bus in 
Misr al-Qadimah, and a number of other terrorist acts. 
  Salih said he and others who frequented the apartments they 
rented in al-Ma'sarah made bombs and explosives to use in 
terrorist attacks. 
  He confessed that before his arrest in al-Ma'sarah Wednesday 
he and colleague terrorists Muhammad Ahmad Farhan and Tharwat 
Hajjaj threw bombs at security forces. Hajjaj managed to flee.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 23 Jan (MENA)--Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif 
Sidqi asserted that the government has not and will not keep 
silent about any incident of corruption, no matter who the 
perpetrator. 
  Addressing a People's Assembly session held today to debate 
the report of the committee tasked with replying to the 
government policy statement, Sidqi said every report on 
corruption or deviations from any source, even anonymous ones, 
is passed on for investigation with the knowledge of the 
authorities concerned. 
  He added that people must not be accused without evidence or 
according to mere reports because this is regarded as 
intellectual terrorism. Referring to newspaper reports on 
corruption cases, he said if such corruption happened in any 
society, such a society would be barbaric. 
  Speaking about corruption, Khalid Muhyi-al-Din, opposition 
leader in the People's Assembly, said he did not mean by his 
speech to accuse anyone and that he knows that Prime Minister 
Dr. 'Atif Sidqi is the one who ordered an investigation on 
Madinat al-Nasr's multimillionaire. He added that he knows the 
government, including not only the council of ministers but also 
the administration agency, is opposed to such acts. I do not 
mean to stand up against anyone or accuse anyone without 
evidence, he remarked. 
  Kamal al-Shadhili, minister of state for the People's 
Assembly and consultative council affairs, said corruption is 
not common practice, and that the prime minister has affirmed 
that neither corruption nor deviations will be protected and all 
such cases will be invesitgated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A government official of the United States has 
denied that President Bill Clinton's letter to congressmen on 
Punjab contained anything anti-India or it encouraged 
secessionist elements in the country. He said in Washington 
yesterday that the President in his letter had pointed out that 
the situation has improved in Punjab. He said the President has 
also mentioned that there were regional elections and 
restoration of local governments, while the level of violence in 
the state has declined. 
  The director general of Punjab police, Mr. K.P.S. Gill, has 
said that President Clinton's remarks on Punjab were an outcome 
of wrong information said by the strong anti-Sikh [as heard] 
lobby in the States. He told newsmen in Bombay yesterday that 
the Punjab Police have been successful in controlling the 
militancy in the state.

<F P=106> [Commentary by journalist J.L. Kaul] </F>
  [Text] India has welcomed the major aspects of the January 
14th Moscow Declaration on nuclear nonproliferation as broadly 
what India has been advocating. India considers any step, big 
or small, aimed at general and complete disarmament to end all 
weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, as a 
positive development. It has, however, refrained from signing 
the present Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] as New Delhi 
considers it to be discriminatory. The treaty in effect tackles 
only the countries without nuclear weapons and not those in the 
nuclear club. The treaty virtually seeks to legitimize and 
perpetuate the retention of nuclear weapons in the hands of a 
few countries. 
  India's stress on general and complete elimination of 
nuclear 
stockpiles stems from its ethos. The land of Lord Mahavir and 
Lord Buddha has always believed in peace and tranquility and in 
avoiding the path of confrontation. During recent past, India 
achieved the distinction of having won its freedom through 
nonviolence. The world now stands at a threshold so far as 
stock piling of nuclear weapons is concerned. Even if there is 
no direct confrontation, the mere presence of these stockpiles 
poses immense threat to the security of mankind. World public 
opinion by and large has been in favor of complete elimination 
of such weapons and a ban on their further production. 
  Outside the arena of international politics, there are 
eminent personalities who have hailed India's demand for 
complete elimination of nuclear weapons and its refusal to sign 
the discriminatory NPT. Dr. Thanat Khoman, internationally 
known jurist and diplomat and Thailand's former deputy prime 
minister and founder member of ASEAN, said in New Delhi in last 
November that India did the right thing in not signing the 
discriminatory NPT. The London-based leader of Campaign For 
Nuclear Disarmament (CND), Mr. Bruce Kent, at the end of his 
two-week tour of India a couple of days ago said that nuclear 
powers do not have a right, moral or otherwise, to preach 
nonproliferation to the rest of the world. He said the NPT 
itself is not just about nonproliferation, but about disarmament 
as a whole and it has been made to look as if the whole issue is 
only about stopping non-nuclear states from crossing the nuclear 
threshold. The CND leader added that the nuclear powers have 
won pretty little to fulfill their own NPT obligations of 
shedding their own nuclear arsenals. The ground reality also 
points to this direction. 
  Far from eliminating their nuclear arsenals, the latest and 
the 39th explosion conducted by China on the fifth of October 
1993 has belied the hopes of even a nuclear test moratorium. 
The discriminatory nature of the current NPT is also clear from 
the fact that whereas the United States showed tremendous 
concern about Iraq's nuclear capability because it posed a 
threat to Israel, the same concern has not been shown about 
Pakistan's nuclear program because it is aimed at India. On the 
contrary, it is widely believed that Pakistan's nuclear 
capability was actually built somewhat within the knowledge of 
Washington. 
  Keeping the discriminatory nature of the present NPT in 
view, 
India has affirmed the need to alter the treaty on 
non-discriminatory basis. The NPT review conference is to be 
held next year and India has not accepted the suggestion that 
the treaty should be extended indefinitely and unconditionally 
in its present form. Public opinion, even in Western countries 
too, is (?gearing) round to a recognition that attempts should 
be made to dispense with nuclear weapons. There is now a 
growing realization in America too that the arms race made the 
United States the world biggest debtor. Both Germany and Japan 
have also started to question the discriminatory nature of the 
NPT. Japan has been the only country to have suffered the 
consequences of a nuclear attack and India in keeping with its 
commitment to general disarmament has urged Japan to take 
advantage of the opportunity next year at NPT review conference 
for removing its discriminatory nature. India has also asked 
Japan to join India in its initiative at the UN for a convention 
prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons as 
necessary first step for the elimination and prevention of 
nuclear war. Efforts at nongovernmental level aimed at complete 
disarmament and a comprehensive test ban are also going apace. 
Former U.S. Defense Secretary Mr. Robert McNamara, has revealed 
in Bangalore recently that Indian and American experts have 
agreed to an action plan to work for freeing the world from 
nuclear arsenals.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pressures Again"] </F>
  [Text] The Clinton-Yeltsin declaration from Moscow calling 
upon India and Pakistan to sign the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty (NPT) and join a multilateral forum to make South Asia 
nuclear-free is a sinister anti-India move. Getting Mr. Yeltsin 
to line up with Washington is no big achievement for Mr. 
Clinton. Moscow showed its eagerness to join the United States 
and other members of the Nuclear Club to force India and 
Pakistan to sign the NPT or a regional treaty even during the 
Republican regime in Washington. American support is so vital 
for Mr. Clinton to survive politically even in his own country 
that his international views will be suspect, especially in 
India which has experienced his ability to go back on a contract 
(on cryogenic rocket engine technology), a feat unusual for the 
President of a great country like Russia. The Russian 
concurrence with the US on forcing India to give up its nuclear 
and missiles programmes should not be taken as an irrepressible 
pacifist urge. Its logic is to kowtow to the US, and its net 
impact is to endorse the American approach of being even-handed 
towards India and Pakistan. This, in practice, has been a 
smokescreen for pursuing a policy of not to let India grow in 
power. Even before the Moscow declaration, it had been the 
consistent Western policy to magnify the threat of Pakistan's 
nuclear capability which, as the world knows, was developed 
within reasonable knowledge of Washington. It is pertinent to 
ask: Did the US show an intemperate concern about Iraq's 
nuclear capability because it posed a threat to Israel, and did 
not show a comparable anxiety at Pakistan's nuclear programme 
because it was aimed at India, and not Tel Aviv? Pakistan has 
declared on several occasions that it would sign the NPT only if 
India did so. This country-specific approach does not worry the 
US, but Larry Pressler's country-specific law for a nuclear 
Pakistan causes great unease in the State Department. 
  Washington's partisan approach on nuclear and missile issues 
is likely to raise complex bilateral questions between New Delhi 
and Washington. By getting Mr. Yeltsin's consent, Mr. Clinton 
may have formally mobilised additional international support for 
non-proliferation, but it need not necessarily force India's 
hands. The time has come for India to tell the US that it is 
prepared to discuss the nuclear question, but unencumbered by 
what Pakistan did or did not do in the matter. In fact, the US 
must learn how to deal with India without the Pakistan factor 
for any reasonable success in achieving a convergence of views 
on key issues. On the question of NPT, the crucial question is 
discrimination. Neither the US nor others in the Nuclear Club 
show an inclination to address this matter. Without doing so, 
the charge of intransigence against India is so much of 
nonsense. If a government in New Delhi were to succumb to 
pressure and sign the NPT against national consensus, its 
continuance would be in jeopardy under an onslaught of 
ultranationalist forces. It will be unfortunate if this were to 
happen.

  [Text] New Delhi, 13 Jan -- Dr. Abdul Kalam, scientific 
adviser to the Defense Ministry, has said the refusal of Western 
countries to provide us with ultramodern technical know-how is a 
major challenge. Besides, he said, we will be able to 
manufacture the ultramodern Light Combat Aircraft [LCA] within 
the next two years. He also said the Defense Research Division 
is eager to undertake research on modern technical know-how and 
surpass the obstacles erected by Western countries. Dr. Abdul 
Kalam, known as the father of Indian missile technology, is a 
great expert. 
  A conference of dignitaries from various Defense Ministry 
research divisions was held in New Delhi. Several personalities 
participated, including Air Chief Marshal S.K. Kaul. Dr. Abdul 
Kalam disclosed some facts to the scientists that participated 
in the conference. He said: The Western countries have 
declined to provide India with the latest technical know-how 
required by the military, especially by the Air Force. Under 
these circumstances, the government has decided to undertake new 
ventures based on our indigenous technical know-how. 
Accordingly, a committee of scientists from various important 
defense units, including the Defense Ministry and Air Force 
Research Wing, has been established. We need ultramodern 
technical know-how for our defense sector, because we know the 
position of the erstwhile Soviet Union since its fragmentation. 
Therefore, we cannot afford to be at anyone's mercy. The LCA 
light fighter aircraft will be manufactured by June 1996. The 
LCA is the smallest fighter plane used in the various parts of 
the world. It can be operated by one person. This type of 
aircraft is the lightest one; it is used for various purposes on 
the battle front. This aircraft, which can fly very fast and 
change altitudes very quickly, will be manufactured within the 
next two years.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that he has 
instructed the Israeli delegation to the talks with Syria to 
verify whether both countries were negotiating a peace agreement 
that would stand alone or one that was linked to another accord 
on a different track. Rabin noted that the United States 
believed that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad was showing signs 
of moderation and moving closer toward Israel's interpretation 
of peace. Yet Syria had not changed its position one iota on 
the price Israel would have to pay in exchange for a peace 
agreement. The Syrians were demanding a full withdrawal and as 
far as Damascus was concerned this was non-negotiable. 
  As for the negotiations with the PLO, Mr. Rabin explained 
that the PLO had made several attempts to back out of certain 
issues, mainly in the field of security, that had already been 
agreed upon in the Declaration of Principles. However, in 
Rabin's assessment, the Palestinians had realized that Israel 
was adamant in its position regarding internal and external 
security. Therefore, Rabin said, one could say that a certain 
degree of progress had been made recently. 
  Moving on to the issue of the border crossings, Rabin said 
that Israel insisted on having the right to examine every person 
crossing the border in what he called a sterile room, manned 
exclusively by Israelis. There would be a Palestinian presence 
at the border terminal, but Israel would be responsible for the 
passageway between the bridge and the border terminals. Our 
correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Prime Minister Rabin was 
speaking at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.

  [Text] Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to 
the United States, told our correspondent Arye Golan that there 
will be no change in the negotiations with Syria because of 
Basil al-Asad's death. 
  [Begin recording] [Rabinovich] We are taking part in 
negotiations with the state of Syria, and people negotiating 
with Syria should not engage in analyses and speculations about 
the country's domestic problems. After checking with the State 
Department, it turns out that as things stand at the moment my 
Syrian counterpart will report to the talks on Monday [24 
January]. For our part, we will report on time, and the 
negotiations will begin and be conducted as normal. 
  [Golan] Do you foresee that in the round of talks opening 
next week we will be called upon to decide on concessions, 
perhaps very big concessions, regarding the Golan Heights? 
  [Rabinovich] No. We know what Syria's demands are. The 
Syrians want us to make very big concessions. We have 
indications that in the meeting between Presidents Clinton and 
al-Asad the Americans were impressed that the Syrians are 
prepared to meet us halfway on the questions of peace. We have 
yet to receive from the Syrians direct and authoritative 
corroboration of this information. We have yet to discuss 
security and other issues pertaining to these negotiations with 
the Syrians before we reach the moment where decisions are 
required on our part. Therefore, we are not talking about a 
time frame. The resuming negotiations have a crowded agenda, 
and I believe the diplomacy that preceded them produced enough 
steam to get the negotiating cart moving. However, it is too 
early to tell when exactly we will have to start discussing our 
part of the equation. 
  [Golan] Ambassador Rabinovich believes no breakthrough was 
made in the meeting at the White House last night between 
Jordan's King Husayn and President Bill Clinton. 
  [Rabinovich] Judging by all appearances, the meeting was 
routine and, as far as we know, nothing dramatic occurred. 
Israel's relations with Jordan and the Israeli-Jordanian 
negotiations have been a long-standing affair, full of meetings 
and sessions, including many sessions without our attendance in 
which these negotiations are discussed. I think the 
Clinton-Husayn meeting should be seen in that light. [end 
recording] 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0800 GMT on 22 January 
carries an interview with Rabinovich by IDF Radio political 
correspondent Natan Gutman; the place and date is not given. 
Rabinovich says Syria should be pleased with Israel's 
announcement about a referendum on the future of the Golan. In 
a recorded passage, the ambassador says: "This is the first 
time that an Israeli Government decides such a move. The 
Syrians should read this move to mean that the government 
regards these negotiations and their possibilities very 
seriously. Were I in their shoes, I would be encouraged that 
the Israeli Government regards these negotiations and their 
possibilities so seriousnly."]

<F P=106> [Interview with Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu by Arye </F>
Golan in Washington on 19 January--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Golan] Asked to explain his 
objection to the deployment of U.S. troops on the Golan Heights, 
Netanyahu said: 
  [Netanyahu] The problem in the Golan Heights is that it, 
unlike the Sinai, requires both defensive forces that can repel 
a surprise attack by Syria and forces that can forewarn of such 
an attack. At present, both these tasks are performed by IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] troops. No one thinks the United States 
should send divisions to defend us on the Golan, because that 
would be against the whole Zionist ethos which speaks of 
national Jewish revival and of a Jewish rather than an alien 
force defending the Jewish state. 
  Second, the idea that U.S. soldiers should be deployed in 
intelligence positions on the Golan is also inapplicable, 
because the Golan case differs from the Sinai. By handing the 
forewarning function over to the Americans, we would be creating 
unnecessary tension and severely trying the U.S.-Israeli 
relationship needlessly. 
  [Golan] You do not entirely trust the Americans in this 
matter? 
  [Netanyahu] On the contrary, I have great regard for the 
United States' amity, and I appreciate its willingness to assist 
Israel, but I do not want to put the United States to tough 
tests such as that which faced its troops in Beirut, where they 
were attacked by terrorists, or what is happening to the U.S. 
troops in Somalia. I see no need or reason for U.S. soldiers to 
defend Israel.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, chief of </F>
staff, by Tzvi Timor and Aharon Klein; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] ['AL HAMISHMAR] What did you think of al-Asad's 
speech in Geneva? Do you think it means progress and a 
breakthrough, from Israel's viewpoint? 
  [Baraq] I think the progress is mainly on a symbolic level. 
A commitment was created by his very uttering of such words 
while addressing the U.S. President and, later, the entire world 
in the presence of the U.S. President -- with Clinton adding 
some things. Yet the content was no different from things he has 
said on previous occasions in various places, including public 
ones. But I think it was nevertheless an achievement from the 
point of view of American and Syrian diplomacy. 
  As for Israel, we have time, and time will show whether a 
breakthrough did or did not take place. If we learn that 
al-Asad is prepared to hold pragmatic discussions on the 
substance of peace and the nature of security arrangements, it 
will definitely mean progress. If, however, we learn that he is 
not prepared to hold such a dialogue, we will realize that no 
progress was achieved and that he may have been merely 
attempting to make progress vis-a-vis the Americans. Time will 
show whether that is the situation. In any event, if and when a 
dialogue is launched, we will keep an unwavering eye on the 
vital security interests of Israel, which are to remain intact. 
  ['AL HAMISHMAR] Is the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] drafting 
plans for a possible withdrawal? Has the Army prepared any 
contingency plans? 
  [Baraq] That is unnecessary at this stage. I have already 
said once that we are intimately familiar with the Golan Heights 
and if and when we are required to present our stand, we will be 
able to do so at any kind of discussion about its future. We 
must remember that the IDF has no part in the making of such 
crucial political decisions. It has an interest in and a stand 
on the security aspects of each decision, and it will present 
its stand to the cabinet, apprise the Knesset of it, and inform 
the general public of it in the appropriate fashion. 
  ['AL HAMISHMAR] Is the IDF capable of defending Israel in 
any feasible situation, assuming there will be a partial or a 
full withdrawal? 
  [Baraq] I say that in our current place and situation, and 
in the situations we have had to face to date, we need the Golan 
Heights very much. Every meter, every hill, every ridge and 
knoll. As long as the current situation remains unchanged, as 
long as the perils inherent in the current situation remain 
unchanged -- namely, as long as a Syrian attack is still a 
realistic possibility, even though not tomorrow morning -- we 
need all of the Golan Heights. If the question refers to 
hypothetical situations, I do not think this is the right time 
to reply. If a different relationship is established -- a 
relationship of substance rather than a merely technical or 
formal one -- there will be things that can be reconsidered. In 
any event, I do not believe there will ever be an Israeli 
Government that will create a situation in which the State of 
Israel is indefensible. 
  ['AL HAMISHMAR] Should an agreement with Syria include a 
demand for -- or even insistence on -- the deployment of U.S. 
disengagement troops on the Golan Heights or the Hermon? 
  [Baraq] It is hard to answer this question without knowing 
what kind of an arrangement we will have. Any peace arrangement 
with the Syrians must include a very complex system of security 
arrangements, including demilitarization and early warning, as 
well as arrangements preventing aggression initiatives in 
general and surprise attacks in particular. Such a system may 
allow for a certain involvement of outside elements, either to 
supervise the arrangement or as part of a joint system of 
control on both sides. I think discussing this question and the 
possibility of troops is premature, because any such thing will 
be the outcome of negotiations, and those have not even been 
launched, and the outcome of such negotiations depends on what 
the parties want. It would be wrong to discuss partial 
components at this time. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Udi Segal] </F>
  [Excerpt] Israel will demand from the United States 
military superiority along the northern border within the 
framework of any agreement on a Golan Heights withdrawal, 
political sources in Jerusalem disclosed at the weekend. Israel 
will be opposed to strategic parity and will demand means to 
assure the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] qualitative 
superiority. Israel will demand demilitarization of the Golan 
Heights area from which it will pull back, and even beyond that 
into Syrian territory, but will insist on its demand that there 
will not be equal footing [last two words in English], which 
would mean demilitarization of the Upper Galilee. 
  The framework of the security package Israel will demand 
will 
include, as already reported, a demand for early warning 
stations deep inside the territory to be evacuated, a move which 
would permit a territorial concession. When Ambassador Itamar 
Rabinovich, head of delegation to the talks with Syria, meets 
his Syrian counterpart Muwaffaq al-'Allaf in Washington 
tomorrow, he will insist on first discussing the security 
arrangements. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay </F>
Gur by Itay Engel and Ya'el Dan--live] 
  [Text] [Engel] We first want to ask you about the report 
in DEFENSE NEWS, which says that Israel will demand Syrian 
demilitarization beyond the Golan Heights, right up to Damascus. 
Are you prepared to confirm or deny the report? 
  [Gur] All those reports are rubbish. No deliberations have 
yet been held on that, therefore anybody who quotes us is just 
making things up. 
  [Dan] Do you also call rubbish a report we aired this 
morning that Israel is demanding military superiority and not 
parity with Syria? 
  [Gur] Everything reported on Israel's detailed position on 
the security arrangements in an agreement with the Syrians is 
complete and utter nonsense. 
  [Engel] Can you then tell us what instructions the Israeli 
delegation is receiving on the security aspects? 
  [Gur] I cannot tell you what instructions they are 
receiving, but I will tell you that we have not reached the 
stage of discussing the details of security arrangements, 
therefore I do not understand how people believe those rumors. 
The main problem is that the Syrian president has refused to 
specify how he views the peace, therefore we are not prepared to 
enter into any negotiations or go into any details on our 
position until we know what peace we are talking about. That, 
of course, includes everything that comes under the heading of 
security arrangements, and I reiterate: everything reported in 
our name on security arrangements is a figment of the 
imagination. 
  [Dan] But what can Israel theoretically demand on security 
arrangements for the Syrians to return to the Golan? 
  [Gur] Since I am deputy defense minister, I will not answer 
theoretical questions, commentators can do that. I can answer 
questions on policy, which is not dealing with any details of 
arrangements before we know what type of peace we are discussing. 
  [Engel] Can you then tell us that there is a political 
assumption in Jerusalem that without progress along the 
Israeli-Syrian track there will be no movement with either the 
Lebanese or the Jordanians? 
  [Gur] I think that if we take what the king has to say at 
face value, then to my regret, even if the Jordanians are ready 
to deal with the small print of the problems facing us -- and it 
has been said more than once that they can be overcome -- the 
king will apparently not want to sign a peace agreement before 
there is a comprehensive accord, which includes Syria. That, of 
course, makes progress in relations between the two states more 
difficult, and does not help our negotiations with the Syrians 
because what is needed there is a move by the Syrian president, 
and as much as I try, I find it hard to understand why he cannot 
say what peace he is talking about with us. 
  [Dan] A question about the compromise worked out between 
Peres and 'Arafat in Oslo so that only technological means would 
be used at the crossing points. Can we really make do with only 
mechanical, technological means without human intervention as 
security measures at border crossings? 
  [Gur] We have to differentiate between two things at the 
border crossings. One is the bridge crossing. In other words, 
Israel's overall security is our exclusive responsibility 
because it was agreed in the first Oslo paper that we are 
responsible for external security and overall security, 
therefore everything to do with defending the border against any 
danger is exclusively Israeli responsibility. The other aspect 
is to what extent we participate in the searches on people who 
have passed customs and have entry papers, to assure they have 
nothing dangerous on them. Technological measures could be used 
at that stage. I did not attend the latest talks between the 
foreign minister and 'Arafat. I can only say that no solution 
was found at the end of last week. If we are drawing closer to 
a solution, I welcome it.

  [Text] Major General 'Uzi Dayan, head of the IDF's [Israel 
Defense Forces] Planning Branch, said the IDF is prepared for 
what he called a rupture in the political process, which could 
lead to a limited war in our region. 
  In a briefing to military correspondents, Deputy Chief of 
Staff Amnon Shahaq said that under the IDF's 1994 work plan, the 
IDF will maintain the same level of alertness on the Golan 
Heights as it has had for the past few years. The reduction in 
the number of Hizballah attacks, Major General Shahaq said, is 
linked to the political process, in which Syria is 
participating, and there is no doubt that Syria will continue to 
use Hizballah according to its political needs, as it has done 
in previous years.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "Wiped the Smiles Off Their </F>
Faces"] 
  [Text] Some matters become boring to read and talk about 
just an hour after they are first mentioned. Such is the 
bombshell about the referendum. It is simply hard to believe 
that in such a short time, so many people said so many words 
about this unborn issue. A nonsense issue from beginning to end. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin does not feel he should ask the people 
anything, certainly not at this time, for the simple reason that 
he knows the answer himself. The answer is that he does not 
even think of surrendering to President al-Asad's unequivocal 
demand to get back all of the Golan Heights, down to the shores 
of Lake Tiberias. Not only does this contradict his preelection 
commitments and his concepts as defense minister, the price 
al-Asad has named as self- evident is not acceptable to Rabin in 
any event. 
  At the end of the "historic summit" day, at midnight on 16 
January Dennis Ross and Martin Indyk came knocking at the door 
of Rabin's Jerusalem home with a smile that, according to an 
eyewitnesses, was 20-inches long and 10-inches wide. According 
to the eyewitness, Rabin wiped the smile of their faces in 15 
minutes. He complained that the administration had lent its hand 
to al-Asad's demand on banning Israeli reporters. And how come 
al-Asad mentioned UN Resolution 425 as applying only to Israel 
when, according to its own words, it also applies to the Syrian 
presence in Lebanon? 
  Regarding the normalization clause, they said happily: We 
did it. [last three words in English] To which Rabin replied, 
somewhat disparagingly: You did it. [last three words in 
English] He meant that Clinton had done al-Asad's work for him. 
While al-Asad kept a poker face on certain issues, Clinton 
spoke about them. Rabin was certain the U.S. envoys came to 
brief him about the new things that al-Asad whispered in 
Clinton's ear regarding the nature of peace. To his surprise, 
but mainly to his disappointment, he heard nothing that the 
Israelis could not have seen on television. The envoys did their 
best to beautify al-Asad's intentions, providing complex 
Talmudic interpretations of his vague remarks. Rabin was left 
with the impression that, speaking on the issue of 
normalization, al-Asad still uses riddles. Yet, speaking with 
Clinton, al-Asad was very clear on the nature of withdrawal: No 
territorial compromise. He wants a withdrawal from every inch. 
This proves that when he so chooses, al-Asad -- sick or not -- 
suffers no problem in articulation. 
  The two American envoys left the prime minister's home with 
their wings clipped. Rabin asked them questions they could not 
answer: Does al-Asad understand that Israel will demand that he 
drastically cut back the Syrian Army deployment deep to the east 
of the Golan Heights? Has he agreed to precise mapping of the 
demilitarization lines combined with long-term dates? Has he 
realized that he will be asked to rid himself of most of his 
chemical weapons? President 'Ezer Weizman also deflated the 
spirits of the two emissaries when they dined with him. 
"Al-Asad maneuvered Clinton," he told them candidly, adding: 
"You may tell him that I said so." 
  Indeed, the impression was created here that Clinton, a 
novice in foreign affairs, is not too well versed in decoding 
seemingly innocent utterances. He misinterpreted al-Asad's 
condition for agreeing to close a deal with Israel as doing it 
in the framework of a comprehensive peace. This condition means 
that even if we get off the Golan Heights, there will be no 
normalization before we sign agreements with Lebanon and Jordan, 
finalize the status of the territories with the Palestinians, 
solve the problem of Jerusalem and, who knows, perhaps also make 
peace with Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. 
  Ross and Indyk also tried to sell their sweeping 
interpretation directly to the Israeli public. In an 
extraordinary move, they met the political correspondents and 
columnists, and gave interviews to Israeli television stations 
in an attempt to portray the Geneva summit as an incredible 
achievement. The impression here, however, is that the only 
achievement made during the summit was the rapprochement between 
the United States and Syria, which the two countries have an 
interest in promoting. Al-Asad shed crocodile tears when, 
during the press conference, he said that in every Syrian house 
there is a family mourning a son who fell "to defend Syria." 
This false presentation of the facts simply cries to high 
heaven. They fell because of Syria's repeated attempts to 
destroy the State of Israel; not to mention the 20,000 grieving 
families of the people slaughtered in Hamah on personal orders 
from al-Asad. The Syrian president does not feel there is a 
price for aggression. Just the contrary. He feels he deserves 
trophies and the royal treatment for failing to destroy Israel. 
It is also worrying that even the current friendly U.S. 
Administration wants us in borders that even UN Resolution 242 
does not call for. 
  This new beginning is not encouraging on the eve of the 
resumption of the Washington talks. Their commitment to the 
comprehensive settlement already made the Americans invite the 
Palestinians to the talks. If the negotiations tracks are 
joined, with Syria leading the way in coordination with the 
Americans, there is a justifiable fear that the administration 
might be tempted to pressure Israel to work according to a 
timetable, with terms set by al-Asad. The referendum affair, 
therefore, could be perceived not as a brilliant tactic, but as 
a surface-to-surface missile expressing Rabin's displeasure. 
The warhead of this missile carries a simple message: I have a 
mandate for territorial compromise with solid security elements; 
I would have no mandate nor a majority's support if the issue in 
question is returning to the 1967 borders -- so, let us ask the 
people. To be sure, Rabin has primarily placed constraints on 
himself. This shows us that along the long, very long way to 
peace with Syria, many a smile stands to be wiped off faces.

  [Excerpts] This morning's cabinet session was chiefly 
devoted to a comprehensive briefing by IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] intelligence elements. At the end of the session, 
Minister Yosi Sarid said that 1994 may yet turn out to be the 
most important year in the history of the State of Israel, 
during which peace agreements will be signed between Israel and 
all its neighbors. Ministers estimated that the intense 
political activities might heighten the efforts of terrorist 
elements to thwart the political process. Our correspondent Udi 
Segal reports on the political portion of the cabinet session: 
  [Begin recording] [Segal] The weekly cabinet session ended 
about an hour ago, and most of it was devoted to a comprehensive 
political-security briefing by IDF intelligence elements, headed 
by Chief of Intelligence Major General Uri Sagi. Based on these 
intelligence assessments, most ministers sounded cautiously 
optimistic. [passage omitted] 
  Minister Hayim Ramon believes that some components of the 
Iranian and Iraqi threat may be neutralized through political 
action on the Syrian track. 
  [Ramon] The most significant conventional threat is posed by 
Syria, of course. That is why it is so important to reach a 
peace agreement with Syria and extricate it from the circle of 
war. 
  [Segal] Turning to more immediate matters, the cabinet 
discussed the ongoing negotiations with the Arab partners, 
mainly the Palestinians, and the understandings reached by Peres 
and 'Arafat in Oslo. Cabinet ministers believe there is a 
chance for progress, but there are still numerous difficulties 
on the way to the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  [Construction Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer] The prevailing 
view, to which I fully subscribe, is that sooner or later we 
will overcome the difficulties and the Israeli-Palestinian 
agreement will get on the road. This cannot be said of the 
Syrian track seeing that, as you know, the talks are scheduled 
to resume tomorrow but because of the death of Hafiz al-Asad's 
son, Syria is having problems and an agreement may very well be 
delayed. However, I believe that after one or two sessions we 
will have enough indications about the seriousness of Syria's 
intentions. I believe that if he had not had enough reasons, 
al-Asad would not have met Clinton. 
  [Segal] Ministers Yosi Sarid and 'Uzi Bar'am asked the prime 
minister to explain to them why he sent Deputy Defense Minister 
Mordekhay Gur to announce his decision to hold a referendum 
about the Golan to the Knesset before notifying the cabinet. 
Rabin noted down their criticism. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 23 January 
adds that "the IDF intelligence briefings indicated a real 
Syrian commitment to the continuation of the political process. 
Several ministers expressed the view that a breakthrough in 
Israel's relations with Syria should be expected because 
Damascus was determined to extricate itself from the cycle of 
war, improve its relations with the United States, and enter a 
period of calm in the Middle East."]

<F P=106> [Discussion between political correspondent Shlomo Raz at </F>
the Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem and anchor Yisra'el Segal 
following the Peres-Musa meeting--live] 
  [Text] [Segal] After his meeting with Egyptian Foreign 
Minister 'Amr Musa, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said that a 
basis has indeed been created for an agreement between Israel 
and the PLO. Musa's meeting with top Foreign Ministry officials 
ended a short while ago, and Shlomo Raz reports: 
  [Raz] I would even take a greater risk than Foreign Minister 
Peres and state that, in fact, the problems between Israel and 
the PLO are very near solution. Some work on preparing drafts 
and formulations will be required, and Foreign Ministry legal 
adviser Yo'el Singer and the PLO's Abu-al-Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] 
have begun working on this. At the same time, in Peres upcoming 
meeting with Yasir 'Arafat next weekend, they will be able to 
finalize the issues of the procedures at the border crossings 
and the extent of the withdrawal from Jericho. That means that 
the first stage of the negotiations on Gaza and Jericho will be 
completed and, except for a few civilian issues, the 
implementation of the agreement can begin. 
  Shim'on Peres, Yosi Beilin, Uri Savir, and others met with 
Musa. After the meeting, which ended a few minutes ago, Peres 
was asked whether the agreement is really close: 
  [Begin Peres recording] I hope so. I believe we have a good 
opportunity to do this, but it has not happened yet. I would 
rather be careful and not describe things that have not yet 
happened as facts. At the same time, a basis was created which, 
perhaps, allows for the attainment of such an agreement. I 
believe 'Amr Musa gave us a picture of the way things are viewed 
on the Egyptian side, which is not much different from the 
Israeli view. [end recording] 
  [Raz] When Peres says that things look alike on both the 
Israeli and the Egyptian sides, he is referring to the fact that 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak met with PLO leader Yasir 
'Arafat yesterday. Hence, we can deduce what Musa is basing his 
optimism on, beyond what he is willing to share with us here. 
  Earlier today, Musa met with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. 
After that meeting, Musa said he brought a message from 
President Mubarak to Rabin. This discussion covered the whole 
range of negotiations with the Arabs but focused mainly on the 
Israel-PLO talks or, to be more specific, on the issue of the 
talks on Gaza and Jericho First, which will resume next week in 
Davos, Switzerland; the Taba talks, which are taking place at 
this time; the economic talks, which are to resume in Paris; 
and, naturally, the Washington talks. Musa spoke about the 
current set of talks: 
  [Begin Musa recording, in English] There are a set of talks. 
I hope, I even trust, that they will push forward the 
Israeli-Palestinian process. I must say that I am not 
pessimistic. [end recording] 
  [Raz] Musa says he is not pessimistic regarding this set of 
talks; however, speaking in closed forums, he said that he is 
very optimistic. The Egyptian foreign minister is currently 
having lunch, after which he will depart for Cairo after holding 
what has become routine meetings between Israeli and Egyptian 
officials, which stem from the willingness of all the parties to 
demonstrate that Egypt is playing a special role in the regional 
processes. 
  [Segal] Could we perhaps add today's remarks to what Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said yesterday about Israel's security 
stands beginning to yield fruit? Does this mean that they will 
be accepted? 
  [Raz] I believe we can say that. In general, the solution 
of the problem of the bridges and border crossings will be such 
that the control will, in fact, remain in Israel's hands, but a 
technical solution is being sought so that Israel's presence at 
the bridges will not be visible. 
  [Segal] Electronic means will be used. 
  [Raz] Electronic and other, perhaps less sophisticated, 
means that are not visible to the naked eye will be used. A 
senior Israeli political source called it the invisible man's 
technique: It sees but is not seen. The parties, therefore, met 
each other half way. Israel gave in on maintaining a physical 
presence but not on actual control. 
  The differences over the Jericho issue have not been bridged 
yet, but it would seem that the Palestinians are inclined to 
understand that Israel will not give them corridors to al-Nabi 
Musa or the Muratas baptism site. They will be allowed to 
construct a resort on Palestinian-owned lands on the northern 
shores of the Dead Sea.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin says that any 
agreement with the Palestinians must ensure Israel's security 
and defense needs. Beilin told Qol Yisra'el that both Israel 
and the Palestinians would like to keep to their agreed 
timetable, and he believes this is possible. He foresees an 
agreement with the Palestinians within two weeks. 
  Regarding Syria, Beilin hoped that President al-Asad would 
not allow the death of his son to interfere with his declared 
desire to reach a peace settlement during the coming year. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1105 GMT on 23 January 
carries a live interview with Beilin, in which he is asked 
whether Israel can sign an agreement with Syria without knowing 
what its future regime holds for us. Beilin responds: "We rely 
on ourselves. That has always been our answer, regardless of 
whether we are signing an agreement with al-Sadat, 'Arafat, or 
any other leader. We are not disbanding our security forces, 
and we will make arrangements which contain sufficient 
guarantees so that even if there is a change in regime it will 
not affect us."]

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Arye Kiesel] </F>
  [Text] A senior military source this weekend admitted that 
in the framework of the current timetable "it will be impossible 
to complete the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal plan by mid-April in 
accordance with the original plan." 
  The source added: "It is possible that we will need one or 
two more months to transfer the territory to the Palestinians 
smoothly." 
  Meanwhile the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is continuing to 
prepare for the withdrawal. Many reserve units have recently 
received call-up notices for February and March to implement 
"rainbow" plan -- the Gaza-Jericho withdrawal and redeployment 
plan. 
  IDF sources say: "We are continuing with the redeployment 
without any connection to the political negotiations. We want 
to attain a situation wherein we will be able to efficiently 
implement any political plan on short notice." 
  The military source confirmed that the IDF has sent call-up 
notices to transport, supplies, and other logistic units. He 
explained, however, that the implementation of the plan is 
dependent on the political echelon's approval. 
  The IDF has also completed its preparations for the release 
of more than 3,000 Palestinian prisoners in case a significant 
breakthrough is made on the Palestinian track. Among those 
slated to be released are sick and elderly prisoners, women, and 
prisoners who are not members of rejectionist front 
organizations and "who do not have blood on their hands." 
  The Finance Ministry has approved an allocation of 350 
million shekels for IDF redeployment following its withdrawal.

  [Text] The deputy chief of staff, Major General Amnon 
Shahaq, says the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will make no major 
changes in its order of battle this year in spite of the peace 
process and Israel's improving political and economic situation. 
The continuing arms build-up among Arab countries, the spread 
of Islamic fundamentalism, and an anticipated increase in 
terrorist activity require Israel to maintain its strength and 
alertness, says Shahaq. 
  The deputy chief of staff was speaking at a meeting this 
morning with military reporters, where he reviewed the IDF's 
plans for 1994. With more, reporter Alan Ben-'Ami: 
  Taking an overall look at Israel's strategic situation, the 
IDF sees three positive trends in three major areas for concern. 
On the plus side, the peace process continues, Israel's 
international standing and relations with other countries are 
getting better all the time, and the country's economic 
situation is steadily improving. Against this, a wary eye needs 
to be kept on the continuing arms build-up of Iran and Arab 
countries, especially with regard to nonconventional weapons. 
The spread of Islamic fundamentalism and the likelihood of 
increased terrorist activity are dangers to be addressed. 
  For the time being, then, the IDF will keep both eyes open 
and its powder dry. No significant changes will be made in its 
order of battle this year, and all branches of the armed forces 
will acquire sophisticated new weaponry and equipment. This 
will include planes and helicopters for the Air Force, 
antimissile systems for the Air Force and the Navy, the first of 
the Saar 5 type missile boats which are now under construction, 
and improved tanks, armored personnel carriers, and advanced 
artillery guns and rocket launchers for the Army. The emphasis 
will be to widen even further the all-weather and 
around-the-clock fighting capabilities of all three branches. 
  In addition to the training programs and exercises for the 
IDF's standing forces, training of reserve forces -- which has 
been erratic in recent years due to budgetary restraints and 
operational duties in the territories -- this would be stepped 
up and put on a more even keel. At the same time, reservists 
are likely to find themselves being called up for duty much 
less, although those in combat units will continue to bear the 
brunt of reserve service. 
  Antiterrorist activity and maintaining the security along 
Israel's border with Lebanon will continue to play a major role 
in the Army's day-to-day operations. Guerrilla and terrorist 
operations by Palestinian and Lebanese groups doubled in 
southern Lebanon last year, compared with 1992. There were 330 
hostile acts of one sort or another, compared with 170 the 
previous year, with Hizballah well ahead of other groups in 
attacks of one sort or another against the IDF and the South 
Lebanon Army. The forecast is for increased terrorist activity 
in the year ahead, both from Lebanon and also in the territories.

  [Text] Summing up 1993, defense establishment officials 
assessed that even after implementing the new arrangements in 
the territories, continuing instability and internal rivalries 
among the Palestinians may hinder efforts to reduce terrorism. 
  According defense sources assessments, the opponents of the 
peace agreement, especially members of Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement], will continue to attempt to obstruct the political 
process. The security sources noted that there had been an 
improvement in Israel's strategic situation and that the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] enjoyed clear superiority over its main 
foe, Syria. Damascus, nevertheless, had not abandoned the 
military option, and even if the peace process continued to 
progress at the present rate this could not guarantee that the 
Arab armies would either cut back in size or halt their military 
buildup. 
  As for Israel's relations with the United States, the 
sources 
explained that in future, domestic economic problems may have a 
detrimental effect on Washington's readiness to rapidly meet 
Israel's needs.

  [Text] Defense establishment sources said that Russia and 
eastern European countries are continuing to supply arms to the 
Middle East in order to earn foreign currency. According to the 
sources, the arms race would continue in the long run because 
there were cheap weapon stockpiles in eastern Europe and Russia. 
Additional countries, such as China and North Korea, had also 
begun selling arms to the region. The sources noted that 
increasing pressure from Western arms industries to produce 
weapons would lead to a continuation of the arms race. These 
trends would effect the scope of the threats that the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] would have to face over the coming years. 
  Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that 
according to the defense sources, Iraq remained in regional and 
international isolation and the efforts to supervise its nuclear 
capabilities continued. Iran was purchasing weapon systems and 
submarines and rapidly emerging as the main danger to the 
region. The Persian Gulf, the sources explained, would remain a 
source of instability and it could be safely assumed that Saddam 
Husayn's behavior would remain a constant cause of tension. 
  It was also reported that approximately 25 percent of the 
IDF's budget last year was earmarked for its military buildup, 
approximately 25 percent was spent on training, 10 percent on 
operational activities, with the remaining 40 percent going to 
maintenance and wages. 
  Last year, the Intelligence Branch focused on improving 
early 
warning capabilities, pinpointing threats, and coping with 
long-range challenges. The Intelligence Branch invested great 
efforts in supplying all the information needed for the 
political process. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 23 January 
carries a report by Yariv Ben-Yehuda about a briefing to 
military correspondents by Major General Amnon Shahaq and Major 
General 'Uzi Dayan, respectively the deputy chief of staff and 
the head of the IDF's Planning Branch. Referring to the IDF's 
work plan for 1994, Shahaq is quoted as saying that the plan 
"does not foresee changes in the deployment of the troops on the 
Golan Heights," and that "the entire security budget totals 
20.24 billion shekels."]

<F P=106> [Political correspondent Gadi Sukenik report] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Energy Minister 
Moshe Shahal met today in London for several hours with the 
energy minister of Qatar. The meeting was designed to promote a 
huge deal to export gas from Qatar to Israel and Europe. The 
future of the deal remains unclear. Our political correspondent 
Gadi Sukenik is in the Tel Aviv studio with further details: 
  Shim'on Peres arrived in London from Oslo this morning, 
Moshe 
Shahal flew from Israel. They apparently met at the Hilton Park 
Lane Hotel in central London and from there set out for a 
meeting with the Qatari foreign minister and several of his 
advisers. The reason for their meeting: a gigantic transaction 
worth over $1 billion. Qatar has natural gas which it is 
considering shipping in containers through the Red Sea to a 
special port which may or may not be constructed in Elat. From 
there the gas will travel through pipelines at the bottom of the 
Mediterranean Sea to Europe. The economic viability of all 
this, at least as far as Israel is concerned, is extremely 
doubtful. Natural gas can also be purchased from Egypt. The 
discussions in London were not about the deal itself, but only 
about the possibility of conducting feasibility studies to 
decide whether or not doing it is economically worthwhile. 
  Energy Minister Moshe Shahal has recently held a series of 
meetings on this matter, both within Israel and abroad. Shim'on 
Peres entered the picture because this deal may constitute, 
among other things, the first practical fruit of the peace 
process. But, to an even greater extent, Peres is getting 
involved with the aim of using this deal as a first-ever lever 
to promote further initiatives between Israel and the Arab world.

  [Text] Ambassador Suhayl Shammas, head of the delegation to 
the Washington peace talks, left Beirut today for Washington to 
participate in the meeting of the heads of delegations on 
Monday. Before his departure he said: 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] You are leaving 
today for Washington to take part in the 12th round of peace 
talks. What can you say about the Lebanese file you are taking 
with you to these talks? 
  [Shammas] Before answering this question, I would like to 
say 
why I am going to Washington. After consultations with the 
United States and Russia in their capacity as cosponsors of the 
peace conference that was launched in Madrid, Lebanon yesterday 
received through the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon an invitation to 
attend negotiations that will resume on 24 January at the level 
of delegation heads. On this basis, I am leaving Beirut today 
for Washington provided with a unified Lebanese political 
decision made with the information available to the government 
and after thorough coordination, which is natural, between 
Lebanon and Syria. This coordination was capped two days ago 
with the expanded summit in Damascus. I am going to Washington 
carrying the Lebanese people's aspirations and desire for an 
honorable peace that will safeguard Lebanese rights and bring 
about peace and security in the region based on a comprehensive 
solution and justice. The concept of a comprehensive solution 
was established and confirmed at the summit meeting between 
Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
In addition, a positive climate has been generated by this 
summit that we can use to push the peace process forward. 
  [Reporter] The Israeli response is still unclear, as 
President al-Asad, who paved the way for a fair and 
comprehensive peace, has said. How can you interpret this? 
  [Shammas] In fact, President al-Asad was extremely candid. 
He has committed himself to the peace process and answered 
every question with complete clarity. He declared Syria's sure 
commitment to the peace process and his desire for a genuine 
peace. He elaborated on the elements of peace, which I do not 
want to repeat. All I would like to say is that his clarity was 
sufficient and the topics he dealt with were clear and so the 
ball is now in the Israeli court. The Israeli prime minister, 
who on several occasions voiced his desire for peace, has to 
take the necessary steps within the framework of the one 
clarified at the joint news conference held by Presidents 
Clinton and al-Asad. I do not want to comment further on this 
issue. 
  [Reporter] In your view, this time will the U.S. role of 
full 
partner be more effective in pressuring Israel to implement the 
UN Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolution 425? 
  [Shammas] Resolution 425 is valid and is a basic factor in 
the Lebanese position. The press uses certain descriptions, 
which I can neither approve nor reject. What I want to say is 
that President Clinton declared in a loud voice that Syria is 
the key to peace. He used clear English terms that leave no 
room for misinterpretation or doubt. He said: Syria is the key 
[last three words said in English]. He used the article "the" 
[said in English] clearly. This word caused us problems because 
it was not used in Security Council Resolution 242 in its 
English text. The word was clearly used in Geneva this time. 
Such a stance by the U.S. President is significant. What 
counts is that all resources should be employed to lay the 
foundation for a comprehensive and fair solution. In a 
comprehensive solution, Lebanon will be protected, particularly 
because it entered these negotiations in close unison with 
fraternal Syria. This is not rhetoric but fact because as long 
as Lebanon and Syria are in full agreement, they will be safe 
and sound. 
  [Reporter] Will the 12th round of talks be held this month, 
Mr. Ambassador? 
  [Shammas] We are now going to Washington to resume 
negotiations at the level of delegation heads. The results of 
our contacts will decide if there is a point in holding a new 
round. So, watch what will happen in Washington. I would like 
to tell you that for a long time you are not going to hear my 
voice. This is the last time you will hear me; you will spare 
your listeners a dissonant voice. Thank you. 
  [Reporter] The Israeli ambassador to the United States said 
yesterday that Syria is the key to a Middle East settlement. He 
does not expect peace agreements with Lebanon, Jordan, and the 
Palestinians at this stage. What do you think? 
  [Shammas] We believe, and the Lebanese officials have made 
many statements at various levels that if progress is made on 
the Syrian track, all Arabs, especially Lebanon, will benefit. 
But I do not believe that the other negotiating tracks will be 
deadlocked; they will affect each other. The Americans believe 
that Syria is the key to a solution. If the head of the Israeli 
delegation to the talks with Syria, who is also Israel's 
ambassador to Washington, agrees, then this is perhaps a 
positive sign. But I do not necessarily agree with him about 
his other conclusions. [end recording]

  [Text] Progressive Socialist Party leader Minister Walid 
Junblatt has paid tribute to Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad's 
wisdom, position, and insistence on the rights of the Arabs, 
particularly the Lebanese. He said: President al-Asad conveyed 
the Arab demand clearly, rejected separate deals, and regarded 
every such deal as a failure. He held talks with the U.S. 
President from a position of strength, if one can say so. He 
promoted Arab prestige in this meeting. He proved that the 
Arabs have a legitimate right to wage a struggle and regain 
their land in Lebanon, Palestine, the Golan, and other areas. 
He held talks between two equals. The United States will have 
to act as an unbiased mediator to fulfill the Arab demand 
regarding the confirmation and implementation of UN resolutions. 
The ball is now in the court of the Americans and the Israelis. 
  In an interview published by AL-SHIRA' magazine today, 
Minister Junblatt said that President al-Asad discussed 
Lebanon's case on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 
425, which Lebanon is seeking to implement. President al-Asad 
emphasized the need for the Lebanese and Syrian tracks to be 
harmonious. If the Americans are able to give the Golan back to 
al-Asad or Syria and ensure the implementation of Resolution 425 
for Lebanon, the situation will, of course, be better. 
  Minister Junblatt called for a plan to improve the domestic 
situation to deal with normalization with Israel. He said: If 
normalization takes place, the Zionist presence will increase. 
Therefore, what is needed is a plan to strengthen the political 
and economic situation to prevent the Zionists from infiltrating 
through companies and cultural affairs. The Zionist presence is 
subversive and will penetrate into the Arab and Islamic society. 
It will attempt to cause division and strife. 
  Regarding the faction in Lebanon that will suffer most as a 
result of normalization with Israel, Junblatt said: There is 
fear for Lebanon because of fragile national unity, as the 
Zionists might attempt again to divide Lebanon and use previous 
agents or some new agents to undermine national unity. 
Therefore, there is concern about national unity. We want 
national unity to be based on Arab unity with Syria. 
Normalization presents a danger to Lebanon. Some may return to 
wanting sectarian mini states or cantons. 
  Minister Junblatt stressed the need for the government to 
adopt a clearer social policy. Rafiq al-Hariri still represents 
the promise for a political, economic, and reconstruction 
revival. But we call on the government and its head to take 
into account a very important issue--a clearer social policy. 
The government cannot remain without a social policy vis-a-vis 
the labor and farmers' unions, the elderly, and the poorer class 
in Lebanon, which is getting poorer because of the presence of a 
wealthy class that is getting wealthier. The government does 
not yet have a social policy.

  [Text] In an exclusive interview with our correspondent 
today, Mr. Haddadi, the Iranian ambassador in Kabul, described 
Iran's efforts to establish peace and stability in Afghanistan 
and entente cordiale between the warring groups in Kabul. 
  Describing the situation in Kabul as deplorable he said: 
Most foreign embassies have ceased their diplomatic activities 
in Kabul and government offices have stopped working. He added: 
Hospitals in Kabul are full of the injured from recent clashes 
and treatment centers are facing shortages of medicines and 
medical facilities. 
  Referring to the activities of our country's embassy in 
Kabul 
to establish peace in Afghanistan he said: So far direct talks 
have been held with the president, prime minister, and other 
leaders of Afghan mojahedin groups, on several occasions. The 
24-hour cease-fire in Kabul, and the evacuation of diplomats and 
people from the city are the results of those efforts. 
  Declaring Iran's preparedness to continue peace-seeking 
efforts in Kabul he said: A committee, under the auspices of 
the Iranian embassy in Kabul, is to review the existing disputes 
between the warring groups. So far the Afghan president has 
declared his readiness in that respect. Talks are to be held 
with the prime minister and other Afghan leaders.

  [Text] The fiercest war in and around Kabul entered 22nd 
day on Saturday [22 Jan] when rival Afghan parties continued 
attacking each other's positions with air and ground powers. 
  The Hezb-e-Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan] sources in 
Peshawar said that two Scuds were fired by Rabbani forces at 
Zakhira (dump), a civilian populated area between Charasyab and 
Logar. This place had been used by the Red Army and the 
Moscow-installed regimes in Kabul for dumping and storing oil 
for military purposes. 
  Meanwhile,the Hezb-e Eslami chief, Golboddin Hekmatyar told 
THE FRONTIER POST on telephone from his strong-hold at Charasyab 
that his rivals had not so far been able to target his military 
installations in and around Kabul. 
  He said that the Rabbani-Mas'ud forces were using Shindand 
base for serial attacks on his positions. He claimed that the 
Friday [21 Jan] serial bombings by the Rabbani forces on his 
strong-hold at Charasyab was not affective. He said that the 
radio and television being run by his party were operative as 
usual. 
  A newscaster of Hezb radio and television, Ahmed Shah lost 
his life when a rocket hit the building, housing the Hekmatyar's 
own electronic media system. 
  Meanwhile, it is learnt that three planes of Gen. Dostam, 
who 
is commonly known among the Hezb circles as Haji Dostam, landed 
at the Charasyab air base on Saturday. It is believed that the 
planes brought food and other essentials from Mazar-e Sharif. 
  The forces of Gen, Dostam are stationed near Shah Shaheed 
street and Bala Hisar fort. Both these places are close to the 
Charasyab. 
  The Hezb sources said that the oil supply to Kabul from 
Pakistan was continuing. The Afghan planes are seen at Peshawar 
airport everyday, the sources added. 
  According to independent sources the commander Shura met at 
Pul-e-Charkhi again on Saturday at the residence of Mullah 
Saddiq to bring a peace formula acceptable to the both parties. 
Meanwhile, it is learnt that the Hezb-e Eslami has asked all 
the Afghan banks in Pakistan and elsewhere not to entertain the 
orders of the Rabbani government. "The money in Afghan banks is 
not the personal property of Rabbani", said a directive issued 
by the Hezb to the Afghan bank managers. 
  Hezb sources also said that they were giving tough time to 
the Rabbani forces in and around Kabul. The sources rejected 
the government's claim that it had captured the old Microryan. 
  The Afghan embassy spokesman in Islamabad said on Saturday 
that 22 fighters of Hezb were killed on Friday when the Rabbani 
forces attacked Charasyab. The Hezb sources, however, rejected 
the claim. 
  The forces of Gen. Dostam killed 65 fighters of Mas'ud at 
Microryan on Friday during hand-to-hand fighting, the Hezb 
source said in Peshawar. 
  Afghan factions fought with rockets and artillery in the 
capital Kabul on Saturday, scuppering a ceasefire attempt by a 
group of guerrilla commanders, reports Reuter quoting Afghan 
sources. 
  Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami party, 
part of a rebel coordination council, blamed forces loyal to 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani for the failure of the ceasefire 
proposed by a council of Afghan commanders. 
  "The coordination council was keeping peace on Saturday in 
response to the commanders' council appeal before the other side 
floured it by rocketing a Hezb-e Eslami base near Charasyab, a 
Hezb spokesman said in Peshawar.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan 23 (AFP) -- An Iranian newspaper on 
Sunday [23 January] accused the Israeli and US intelligence 
services of masterminding the car crash in which Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad's eldest son, Basil, was killed. 
  "The Zionists are too anxious to deal with a Syria without 
another Hafiz al-Asad, so the incident raises many questions," 
said the daily KAYHAN. "We cannot exclude a role here for US and 
Israeli agents." 
  The newspaper said Basil was the most appropriate 
replacement 
for his father and Syria's "only hope" to continue the "tough 
political heritage" of Hafiz al-Asad, who has ruled the country 
for 24 years. 
  The paper added that Basil was his father's confidant, often 
chosen to launch secret negotiations on Hafiz al-Asad's behalf, 
particularly with the Lebanese Shiite Moslem fundamentalist 
group Hizballah. 
  Basil al-Asad, an Army major who was being groomed to 
succeed 
his 63-year-old father, died on Friday aged 31. He was buried 
on Saturday in the family's home village of al-Qardahah in 
northern Syria, at a funeral attended by several Arab leaders 
and some 100,000 mourners. 
  Basil's death came less than a week after Asad and US 
President Bill Clinton held a summit meeting in Geneva in a bid 
to revive the Arab-Israeli peace process, which Iran fiercely 
opposes. 
  In a condolence message to Asad on Saturday Iranian 
President 
'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani described Basil's death as a 
"tragic event."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Geneva Meeting"] </F>
  [Text] The meeting of the presidents of Syria and the U.S. 
in Geneva came to a close after about 5 hours on Sunday evening. 
After their negotiations the two presidents took part at a 
press conference. 
  Although the details of the negotiations have not yet been 
made available to the media, all evidences point to the 
conclusion that the American president could not get the Syrian 
leader to accept the American point of view as easily as he 
could prevail upon 'Arafat or his predecessor had been able to 
make Anwar al-Sadat yield to the American pressure. 
  The Americans have probably become accustomed to the idea 
that at the end of the cold war period and after the demise of 
their formidable rival, the former Soviet Union, they could 
summon any political leader from the Third World countries and 
dictate their policies to him. 
  However, the American diplomats' efforts of the past few 
months to lure Hafiz al-Asad to Washington have failed to bring 
about any concrete result. Hafiz al-Asad only consented to a 
meeting with the U.S. president in a third country. 
  In the course of the joint press conference, al-Asad held 
firmly to his rightful stance, demanding Israeli withdrawal from 
all territories occupied in 1967 six-day war or comprehensive 
peace settlement with all Arab countries at once. 
  It is worth mentioning that one of the most effective 
diplomatic stratagems employed by Israel in the past two decades 
has been to insist on separate, bilateral talks and settlements 
with individual Arab states. The obvious objective and natural 
consequence of that stratagem is of course to create discord 
among the Arab ranks. 
  In Geneva al-Assad exhibited his awareness of the fact that 
the American president's promises could not be relied on. 
  Clinton -- and George Bush before him -- had made many 
promises to 'Arafat. In practice, however, no serious step has 
been taken to restore to the Palestinian people any of their 
rights. The gap between what is promised by the American 
president and what is actually done by Tel Aviv leaders is 
extremely wide. 
  Interestingly the viewers of the joint press conference were 
only told by Clinton that Syria was seeking to normalize 
relations with Israel. 
  It would of course be quite unwise to pass a hasty judgement 
on the meeting between Al-Asad and Clinton before details of 
their negotiations are known. And in view of the cordial 
relations which exist between Tehran and Damascus, it is quite 
natural that Tehran should be expecting President al-Asad's 
special envoy in the coming days with details of the 
negotiations between the heads of America and Syria.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Al-Asad and Solitary Peace in </F>
the Middle East"] 
  [Text] Thousands of publications, dozens of radio stations, 
and hundreds of correspondents had gone to Geneva to cover the 
sensitive meeting between the U.S. and Syrian presidents. 
  To this list should be added a large number of political 
analysts from various countries of the world acting on behalf of 
many leaders and especially regional statesmen. 
  When the two heads of state appeared in front of the cameras 
for their news conference, many thought that they would utter 
explicit and frank words about the future of the peace process 
the United States has in mind. But neither of them did. 
  Al-Asad, as the leader of a country that sometimes acts 
hastily, stressed his country's former stances but in new terms, 
and promised that by next week he would send his foreign 
minister to Washington for a serious study of views. 
  Meanwhile, Clinton expressed satisfaction over his 
discussions with the Syrian leader. Reports from Geneva 
explicitly show that, contrary to their press communique, the 
two sides held frank discussions; and al-Asad's explicit 
statement that a partial peace in the Middle East is doomed to 
fail was an especially overt reference to the Camp David pact 
and to the Gaza-Jericho accord. 
  Thus, it is clear that Syria envisages its role as going 
beyond solely speaking for itself, so that the United States and 
Israel will not discuss the issue of the Golan Height alone. 
  The Syrians realize that if they discuss only the return of 
the Golan Heights, they can regain just a part of it and they 
will have to recognize Israel's existence. Thus, they have 
gathered together the various Palestinian groups and have taken 
the banner of struggle in their hands so that they can force the 
Americans to put pressure on Israel to withdraw from Golan. 
  Clinton, who has a trump card in his hands with the 
Gaza-Jericho accord, is hopeful about his future foreign policy 
in the Middle East, especially since he has full political 
accord with political leaders there. The factor that hindered 
Carter was that he had to cooperate with the extremist 
Likkudists, who traditionally incline toward the Republicans in 
the United States, while Clinton is dealing with Laborites. 
  Therefore, the current leaders in Israel trust the 
Democratic 
President of the United States. In view of this understanding 
between the two sides, Clinton hopes that he will be able to 
create a viable axis for Syria's entry into the Middle East 
compromise talks. While al-Asad has specifically put forth his 
country's conditions for participating in these talks, he 
prefers to continue the Washington talks in order to stabilize 
and at the same time strengthen his political situation. 
  What can be gleaned from the views expressed by the Syrian, 
American, and Israeli officials is that if al-Asad is prepared 
to accept peace, he will get the price he wants--and this is 
nothing less than the Golan Heights. 
  But the conclusion that Clinton drew from his meeting with 
al-Asad in Geneva was that the Syrian leader is a shrewd 
diplomat who is aware of his weak and strong points more than 
any other person. And probably the young U.S. President has 
expressed hopes that al-Asad will help him to succeed, hence the 
Syrian leader's remark that having hope is not a sin for the 
young, even if he is a president.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Syria in Zero Plus Zero"] </F>
  [Text] When the allies' war against Iraq ended, only the 
simple-minded could have believed that the Americans would leave 
the area. At the same time, it was also proved that there was a 
heavy price tag attached to their staying on, especially when 
more issues came to light and all the Muslims in the region and 
world public opinion found out that Iraq had been armed by the 
West. 
  The Arab countries met the heavy cost of the military 
expedition to the region. But it was the Westerners who got all 
the glory and the shaykhs who got all the disgrace. America, 
which was making plans for the future of the world and the 
region in view of the emerging signs that the Soviet Union was 
disintegrating, starting to create imaginary enemies for the 
shaykhs in a bid to gather them together in a extra-regional 
pact--that is, outside the Persian Gulf. Egypt was one of the 
staunch supporters of this plan and immediately announced its 
readiness to participate; and in order to legitimize this pact 
or gathering, the Syrian capital, Damascus, was chosen as the 
venue. And the pact came to be known as the six-plus-two pact. 
  After the Persian Gulf war, these eight countries met to 
draw 
up plans for a regional security strategy. 
  Now, after at least two years, the six-plus-two has neither 
put forth a plan nor does it have the guts to announce its 
dissolution, even though its recent session was also 
unsuccessful. 
  Meanwhile, the six Persian Gulf countries insist on their 
past beliefs and have fear in their hearts--a fear that is based 
on American analyses and assessments. But Egypt and Syria are 
an exception to this rule. 
  The Egyptians are dreaming of returning to the Jamal 
'Abd-an- 
Nasir era in the Arab world. However, they neither have the 
economic ability nor a leader like an-Nasir to do so. 
Therefore, they attend sessions on America's orders and 
heatedly speak about the process of Islamism in the region and 
about the possible threat of Islamic Iran, hoping to reap 
something from these efforts. But this is not so with Syria. 
  The Syrians accepted the six-plus-two pact because of their 
extensive differences with the Baghdad regime. However, they 
have nothing in common with the other members of the pact. They 
are aware of world diplomacy and of the need for independence, 
and they have adopted a completely progressive course. But the 
Syrian statesmen should also bear in mind that from America's 
point of view the six-plus-two pact is also considered as a club 
of friends who believe in the process of compromise in the 
Middle East. 
  Egypt attends the Damascus sessions because of Camp David, 
and the shaykhs attend the sessions because of their military 
pacts and complete concordance with America. Therefore, Syria's 
presence in such a gathering is a blow to the political prestige 
of an independent and progressive country. Of course, it will 
be a different matter if America succeeds in binding Damascus 
with Tel Aviv. But if not, then Syria will have no place among 
the remaining seven members of the pact.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid 
has said that at their periodic session in March in Damascus the 
Arab foreign ministers will study the lifting of economic 
sanctions on Israel. This announcement by the Arab League 
secretary general came after his meeting with U.S. Secretary of 
Commerce Ronald Brown and shows that the addition of this topic 
on the agenda of the upcoming Arab League foreign ministers' 
session was done because of U.S. pressure. 
  Political observers believe that U.S. pressure on the Arabs 
to lift the economic sanctions on Israel cannot be understood 
with any kind of logic, since the conditions that forced the 
Arab countries to boycott the Zionist regime 40 years ago still 
exist and, apart from the signing of a scrap of paper on 
Gaza-Jericho self-rule, no perceptible change has taken place. 
In other words, the Zionist regime continues to occupy Arab 
territories, is avoiding the implementation of Security Council 
resolutions, and has recently intensified the suppression of the 
oppressed Palestinian people without having any qualms. Thus, 
at a time when there is no new variant that can call for the 
lifting of the Arabs' sanctions on Israel, how can America's 
request be assessed? 
  There is no doubt that Washington-Tel Aviv relations have 
had 
a special characteristic since the establishment of the Zionist 
regime and that America's supportive attitude toward Israel can 
be assessed and understood only within this framework. Bill 
Clinton's meeting with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva 
last week to remove the existing obstacles in the Syrian-Israeli 
talks showed that America is the guardian and mouthpiece of 
Israel, a reality that the White House has not thought necessary 
to hide for a long time now. These sinister relations between 
Washington and Tel Aviv have rendered America partial, which is 
one of the most important obstacles that prevents Washington 
from playing the role of mediator in the solution to the Middle 
East crisis. 
  In view of such a situation, the signing of any type of 
agreement between the Arabs and Israel will definitely benefit 
the Zionist regime.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] Yasir 'Arafat, chairman of the PLO's Executive 
Committee, arrived in Saudi Arabia last night for the first time 
since the oil war. PLO relations with Riyadh and with the other 
members of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] deteriorated as a 
result of the PLO's support for Iraq's attack on Kuwait and its 
occupation of Kuwait; and this has had a detrimental impact on 
the PLO. 
  The GCC member states stopped their financial assistance to 
the PLO because of its stance in the oil war. Some 600,000 
Palestinians living in the Persian Gulf shaykhdoms were placed 
under severe pressure and about half of them had to return to 
Jordan. The voluntary tax, based on an agreement among the 
countries in the Arab League and levied on the Palestinians and 
deposited in the PLO's bank account, has been blocked. PLO 
officials allege that all these problems have led to a financial 
crisis for the PLO. Six months ago the PLO started warning of a 
financial crisis and stopped paying benefits to the families of 
Palestinian martyrs and the salaries of part of its military 
forces in Lebanon. 
  According to a PLO-Saudi Arabian agreement, during his visit 
to Riyadh 'Arafat will meet Saudi King Fahd. This meeting will 
probably be the prologue to an improvement in Saudi-PLO 
relations. Since 'Arafat approached Israel and the United States 
four months ago with the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord, PLO 
relations with GCC members have started to improve gradually and 
PLO embassies have been set up in all the GCC member states 
except Kuwait. 
  'Arafat's current trip to Riyadh will probably pave the way 
for similar visits to other GCC member states.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "In the Margins of a News Report"] </F>
  [Text] A German publication carried a sensational report 
alleging that Hojjat ol-Eslam Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni played a 
role in the suspicious death of an arms dealer years ago; citing 
the brother of the deceased, who is the governor of one of 
Germany's states, it threatened him with death. This is not the 
first time that Western circles and mass media have tried to 
create problems and commotions in pursuance of their 
anti-Iranian and anti-Islamic objectives. After some time 
during which Iran was portrayed as the culprit in the 
assassination of one of the defunct Democratic Party leaders, 
the German mass media and officials were forced--after extensive 
investigations--to officially admit the absence of proof on 
Iran's role in this assassination. 
  The French Government's recent release of two people who 
were 
accused of assassinating Kazem Rajavi, who was assassinated by 
unidentified persons, shows that such accusations cannot harm 
Iran's reputation. It seems that there are circles in the 
Western countries that are trying to create a commotion with 
baseless allegations and thus to provoke public opinion in 
Europe, especially in Germany, against Iranians and the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. 
  The remarks by (Barchal), governor of one of the German 
states shows that this propaganda policy against the Islamic 
Republic of Iran is continuing; according to a report published 
in BILD, (Barchal's) brother, who was an arms dealer, died in a 
suspicious manner years ago. The group in charge of 
investigating the case has claimed that an Iranian group was 
involved in the assassination of this person in Switzerland. 
But the BILD report gives no facts to prove that Iranian 
officials were involved in this act. It seems that in the 
current conditions such propaganda aimed at harming Iran's 
relations with European countries and especially with Germany is 
one of the major topics on the agenda of American, Israeli, and 
British espionage agencies. Calculated steps are needed to 
neutralize such extensive and calculated propaganda, which has 
been going on with specific objectives in mind. 
  For a governor of one of Germany's states to threaten to 
assassinate Hojjat ol-Eslam val Moslemin Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni 
is nothing but a terrorist act, and the German Government should 
clarify its stance on such threats.

  [Text] The special emissary to Afghanistan of the Foreign 
Ministry of the Islamic Republic of Iran has held talks with 
Afghan officials. He described the mediation efforts by the 
Islamic Republic of Iran to establish peace and tranquillity in 
Kabul as positive. 
  According to the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran's correspondent in Islamabad, Ebrahim Taherian, the special 
Iranian emissary to Afghanistan held talks with the warring 
sides in the country and returned to Peshawar in Pakistan. 
  During his three days of meetings in Kabul, he presented a 
verbal message from President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to the 
President of Afghanistan, Borhanoddin Rabbani and also a written 
message by the Iranian Foreign Minister, Dr. Velayati, to Prime 
Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar. He also held talks with the 
Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic Unity Party] Secretary General 
Mazari, and with the representative of the Jonbesh-e Melli-ye 
Eslami [Islamic National Movement] in Kabul. 
  Speaking to the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of 
Iran correspondent this morning, he stated: The Islamic 
Republic of Iran has mustered all its efforts to bring the 
leaders of all the parties involved in the conflict together in 
order to reach a rapprochement, and in this regard it is paying 
special attention to consultations with neighboring countries. 
  The special emissary of the Islamic Republic of Iran to 
Afghanistan added that in view of the efforts so far, the 
warring groups have agreed to select representatives who will 
meet as soon as possible. 
  Taherian added that the Islamic Republic of Iran intends to 
continue its efforts until there is some specific outcome. The 
special emissary of the Islamic Republic of Iran stated that in 
continuation of his assignment, he will commence talks with 
Pakistani officials in order to exchange views on how to reach 
an amicable solution to end the conflict in Afghanistan and to 
encourage the groups involved to compromise. 
  Each of the groups embroiled in the civil war in Afghanistan 
has set preconditions for ending the imbroglio. The spokesman 
for the Jami'at-e Eslami-ye Afghanistan [Islamic Party of 
Afghanistan] said in Peshawar that the President of Afghanistan, 
Borhanoddin Rabbani, has no intention of stepping down from his 
position. 
  According to the Central News Unit in Kabul, to implement a 
cease-fire among the hostile factions, the government will 
collect all the heavy weapons around Kabul. The spokesman for 
Borhanoddin Rabbani added that all the political and government 
centers of Kabul are under the control of the forces of the 
(?government) and former defense minister of Afghanistan, Ahmad 
Shah Mas'ud. 
  In any case, the most (?reliable) source of the Hezb-e 
Eslami 
[Islamic Party] announced in an interview in Kabul that the 
conditions laid down by opponents of Borhanoddin Rabbani's 
resignation remain in effect. They stress that until he steps 
down from his post as President, the struggle will continue.

<F P=106> [Political commentary: "Assistance to Afghanistan and the </F>
Issue of Mediation for Peace"] 
  [Text] While the mediation efforts for ending the 
sanguinary clashes in Kabul continue, the sides involved have 
propounded their conditions for terminating the conflict. 
According to the spokesman of the Hezb-e Eslami led by 
Golboddin Hekmatyar, the prime minister of Afghanistan, the 
conditions for ending the conflict are the resignation of 
Borhanoddin Rabbani from the post of president, the setting up 
of an interim government, the establishment of a national camp, 
and the calling of elections in six months. 
  The spokesman of the Jami'at-e Eslami, led by Borhanoddin 
Rabbani, also stressed that Rabbani should remain in his 
position as president and he set forth as the Government's 
condition that the opposition should remove their heavy weapons 
from around Kabul. Only then will the government agree to a 
cease-fire. 
  It appears from looking at these conditions that it is not 
going to be easy to find common ground for negotiations between 
the two sides. In fact, what has further exacerbated the 
situation is that the involved sides refuse to compromise on 
their conditions because of their sensitivity and the importance 
they attach to their own political status. It seems that unless 
there is some sort of flexibility and tolerance among the Afghan 
factions, there is a very slight chance of reaching any 
agreements on the basis of goodwill. 
  In any case, in the opinion of the observers of Afghan 
affairs, the change in the political situation in Kabul cannot 
help in restoring peace or promote any progress toward peaceful 
objectives, including elections. This is because as long as 
political goals are pursued through military force and weapons, 
an end to the war in the circumstances currently prevailing in 
Afghanistan is unimaginable. 
  In any case, experience proves that under such difficult 
conditions, Afghanistan's friendly neighbors have been able to 
motivate the warring sides to negotiate regardless of their 
irreconcilable conditions. It seems clear that the present 
clash in Kabul is bound to have the same outcome. 
  Meanwhile, according to the emissary of the Iranian Foreign 
Minister to Kabul, all the sides involved in the conflict have 
welcomed the mediatory actions of the friendly neighboring 
countries. Taherian, who met the leaders of the sides involved 
during visits to Kabul and Islamabad on Wednesday [12 January] 
said in an interview that it is difficult to convince the two 
sides to begin negotiations and stressed that the Iranian 
Foreign Ministry is seeking to establish common ground for 
mediation among all the Afghan warring factions by means of 
negotiations with Pakistani Foreign Ministry officials and those 
of all other Islamic countries.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Clashes between the joint forces of General Dostum 
and Golboddin Hekmatyar and forces loyal to Borhanoddin Rabbani 
continued in Kabul on Thursday and the rival groups invaded one 
another's positions with air attacks and long-range weapons. 
  Thus, a cease-fire which was due to be put into effect as of 
yesterday morning in Kabul was broken with exchange of scattered 
fire, and the opposition group's attacks against one another's 
positions. 
  Dispatches received indicate that the set cease-fire was 
proposed by a council of Afghan Mojahedin commanders. 
  The Coordination Council of the Islamic Revolution of 
Afghanistan on Wednesday January the 19th unilaterally announced 
that it will unconditionally accept the cease-fire conditions 
and will observe it as of 6 a.m. Thursday morning. 
  In the meantime, reports coming in from Peshawar, Pakistan, 
indicate that a four man team consisting of the representatives 
of Hekmatyar's Islamic Party, Dostum's National Islamic 
Movement, Mojahedin's National Salvation Front, and the Wahdat 
Party have arrived in Peshawar to hold talks with the 
responsible Pakistani officials, the Afghan parties, as well as 
theologians and the chieftains. 
  Based on this report, another group of Afghan commanders 
too, 
have decided to mediate between the opposition groups and 
supporters of Rabbani's presidency. 
  In the meantime, the United Nations yesterday called on the 
warring sides in Kabul to create safe corridors for relief 
assistance to tens of thousands of Afghans who have fled to the 
nearby cities from Kabul. 
  This is while the International Red Cross Committee has 
announced that clashes between hostile groups in Kabul has left 
600 dead and 7600 injured. 
  War in Kabul continues at a time when the leaders of the 
warring groups have not yet attained common principles on the 
division of power in a country, which has witnessed war for the 
past 15 years, and where military clashes in Kabul has led to 
the killing of a high number of innocent people in that country. 
  Despite mediation by the neighboring countries the clashes 
still continue. 
  Beyond doubt the bloody war which we have witnessed in Kabul 
over the past few days will not entail anything other than 
adding further dimensions to the ruins of 15 years of war. 
  Heavy losses arising from the spread of war and bloodshed 
has 
damaged the brilliant record of 14 years of struggle by the 
Afghan people and will leave its negative and unpleasant effects 
in the history of Afghanistan. 
  Evidently the new conditions which the present leaders are 
trying to obtain by making the use of military power will by no 
means solve the numerous problems faced by the Afghan people, 
for any solution to the problems, specially the political ones 
is legitimate only when the majority of Afghan people accept it. 
  On this basis, the present war whose most immediate result 
is 
spread of ruins, loss of resources, and waste of human force 
will not only not solve any problems of the disastrous stricken 
Afghan people, but will add to their problems. 
  At any rate, the meeting and talks between the four-man team 
and the Pakistani officials is a move aimed at putting an end to 
the clashes and establishment of peace in Afghanistan. 
  And it will be efficient only if all the warring factions 
participate in it. 
  Hence, if one of the warring sides does not take part in it 
the success of the measure has to be doubted. 
  Evidently, although efforts aimed at paving the way for 
meeting among the leaders of the opposition groups in 
Afghanistan may face problems in terms of putting an end to the 
war in Kabul, beyond doubt, perseverance of mediatory countries 
along with flexibility which political groups have to show will 
picture a promising outlook for the agonized Afghan people. 
  At any rate, we must draw the attention of the leaders of 
the 
warring sides to the reality that the experience of the past 21 
months in Afghanistan has shown that war is not the main 
solution to political problems in Afghanistan. 
  And that the continuation of clashes in Afghanistan will not 
entail any result other than increasingly the number of war 
victims who are mostly innocent people.

<F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati in </F>
Tehran on 21 January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The reappearance of the hidden 
imam [12th Shiite imam, believed to have gone into occultation 
in AD 874] requires certain preparatory stages. It will not 
happen without preliminaries and miraculously. The groundwork 
must be laid. That is probably why the period of absence [of 
the Hidden Imam] lasts so long. The groundwork must be laid. 
Some of the preliminaries are voluntary and some non-voluntary. 
  The non-voluntary parts relate to the fact that human beings 
keep moving in certain directions and running into obstacles. 
Human beings who are against cruelty, against war, against 
poverty, against ignorance keep falling into this or that 
person's trap. They keep being misled by politicians and power 
holders; they keep being pulled in different directions and keep 
running into dead- ends. They must experience many dead-ends 
and reach a point where divine leaders and the protectors of 
revelation are the only ones who can save and guide humanity. 
They must reach a stage where they are prepared for the 
acceptance of the hidden imam and God's caliphate. In other 
words, things must reach such a pass that humanity despairs of 
saving itself. Things must reach that stage and they are 
reaching that stage. We are moving in that direction. That is 
one part of the groundwork: the non-voluntary preparations. 
  The voluntary preparations: justice-seekers, worshippers of 
God and those who believe in this hidden imam must prepare 
themselves decisively. Certain movements must come into 
existence. Movements which oppose oppression, revolutions which 
oppose bullying must come into existence; revolutions which 
quest for God, revolutions which quest for Islam, revolutions 
which can make themselves heard throughout the world and declare 
their demands, saying: we do not want territory, we do not want 
water, we do not want money or power; we want justice and 
fairness. Revolutions must come into existence on the basis of 
right and justice. And they must break bullying powers, stand 
up to them, and make their own aims and ideals known to the 
world. They must lay the groundwork. These are the voluntary 
parts. These are the parts which impose duties. These are the 
parts which mean one must discard the mistaken idea that one 
should sit about until the hidden imam comes and sorts things 
out. No! The groundwork must be laid before his holiness 
reappears. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] AL-BA'TH says: The resulting grief from the loss of 
great individuals is equal to their greatness. For a father who 
has lost a son and a president who is leading a people who are 
his children, there are no limits to the tragedy of the 
unexpected death of Major Basil al-Asad. 
  After stating that the homeland has lost one of the most 
brilliant knights of the Arabs and the future, AL-BA'TH 
continues: Because of this tragedy, Hafiz al-Asad, faces one 
test as a man and another as a leader. He must overcome this 
tragedy so it will not turn into a test for the entire nation. 
Only tall trees are hit by strong winds. It is the fate of 
trees to live standing, to die standing, and to remain tall. 
  AL-BA'TH continues: When one stands before the grieving 
father to console him, he is consoled by the wisdom of a leader 
who yields to God's will. Perhaps in his deep grief, the whole 
world becomes unimportant in the eyes of President al-Asad. 
Yet, the whole world greatly appreciates his noble sadness and 
determination to move the region, which has offered the dearest 
sacrifices in the conflict, from the tragedies of the past and 
the present to a just, comprehensive settlement and future 
stability and prosperity. 
  AL-BA'TH continues: In the Geneva summit, leader al-Asad 
gained something indispensable for the Arab future. In 
Damascus, he lost something indispensable. In both cases, he is 
the man who has been acknowledged by the president of the 
strongest state in the world as the key to the settlement 
process and the Middle East future. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes: The [Middle East] issue is too great to 
be overshadowed by tragedies. President al-Asad is leading a 
crucial Arab battle. He has grabbed a historic opportunity to 
restore Arab rights as necessitated by pan-Arab constants in an 
age of tremendous international changes. He is deeply saddened, 
but he does not stop working wisely and firmly. Enduring his 
grave wound, he seeks to heal Arab wounds.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: The meetings of the heads of the Arab 
and Israeli delegations to the Washington talks are due to begin 
today amid cautious optimism. 
  Although U.S. officials expect positive results this time, 
the previous experience with Israel has not been encouraging. 
Furthermore, since the historic Geneva summit between Presidents 
al-Asad and Clinton and the emphasis it placed on a 
comprehensive and just solution on all fronts, the Israelis, 
represented by their prime minister and their negotiators, have 
continued to cast doubts on the results of the summit as well as 
Syrian intentions. They then aggravated the situation by 
calling for a referendum on the Golan -- as if the Golan is not 
occupied Syrian territory that Israel usurped by force in 1967. 
  Since the end of Geneva summit, observers agreed that the 
ball is now in Israel's court since Israel has committed itself 
to peace requisites within the framework of a real and honorable 
peace. The observers believe that Syria had contributed to the 
peace process despite all the obstacles created by Israel. 
  Likewise, the observers agreed that this referendum game of 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is nothing but a maneuver 
to curb the momentum of the peace process and its requisites. 
Throughout history, no occupier had ever conducted a referendum 
on a land that does not belong to it. What, then, about the 
case of the Golan -- in which UN Resolutions have upheld its 
Syrian identity, declared all Israeli measures concerning it 
null and void, and urged Israel to fully withdraw from it? 
  The success of the Washington talks, expected to be held 
today, depends on a positive Israeli position devoid of 
maneuverability and procrastination. In fact, the UN 
resolutions that were adopted as the basis of the peace 
settlement in the region do not leave any room for ambiguity. 
There is no room for all these Israeli maneuvers on this 
subject. 
  It is true that the negotiations usually face ups and downs, 
but there are basic principles that should be respected and 
translated into a tangible results, foremost of which is land 
for peace. Land does not mean part of the Golan, south Lebanon, 
or the West Bank. It means all of the Golan, south Lebanon, and 
the West Bank. Security guarantees should be mutual, especially 
since Israel is the one that threatens the Arabs, not vice 
versa. Had Israel committed itself to these principles, peace 
would have prevalent in the region by now. 
  The Washington talks have always been confronted with 
Israel's strange interpretations of Security Council resolutions 
and its deceptive concepts of security guarantees. The Arabs, 
and the whole world, understand that the Security Council 
resolutions mean full withdrawal from the occupied territories. 
Israel is speaking about partial and phased withdrawals. The 
Arabs understand security as mutual guarantees, and Israel wants 
to disarm the Arabs and to add more weapons to its already 
lethal arsenal. The Arabs understand peace as just and 
comprehensive, one that includes all fronts; Israel wants a 
phased peace that will not end occupation and does not lead to 
the withdrawal of its aggressive forces. This is the crux of 
the problem, and there is no solution to this disagreement 
unless Israel bows fully to the resolutions of international 
legitimacy and accepts the exchange of all occupied land for 
peace. 
  Syria and all Arabs are looking forward to a real and 
honorable peace--the peace of the brave about which President 
al-Asad spoke. Al-Asad has asked Israeli leaders to rise to the 
level of this peace. The Arabs are engaged in new talks today 
out of their faith in peace and they are counting on the 
international community taking action on its responsibilities. 
Eventually, the Israeli procrastination that has lasted for 
more than two years must come to an end.

<F P=106> [By 'Assaf 'Abbud from Damascus] </F>
  [Text] In the first Syrian comment on the al-Asad-Clinton 
summit, Jubran Kuriyah, official spokesman for the Syrian 
Presidential Office, has described the summit outcome as 
"positive and encouraging." He added that this outcome will 
reflect on the overall Middle East peace process as well as on 
Syrian-U.S. ties. 
  Kuriyah went on to say that the outcome of the summit will 
also pave the way for the resumption of the peace talks on the 
basis of the land for peace principle and UN Resolutions 242, 
338, and 425. High-level Syrian sources have informed AL-ITTIHAD 
that the next few days will witness intensive meetings in 
Damascus. The meeting due to be held between Presidents al-Asad 
and al-Hirawi today is expected to be followed by a visit to the 
Syrian capital by King Husayn of Jordan, the sources added. 
  In response to a question by AL-ITTIHAD on the Syrian 
position regarding the U.S. proposal to deploy U.S. troops on 
the Golan, the sources said that this position is contingent on 
Israeli's acceptance to withdraw from all occupied Syrian 
territory.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "International Legitimacy and 
the Need To End Israeli Disdain," AL-BA'TH writes: The results 
of the Geneva summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill 
Clinton have undoubtedly provided new prospects for the efforts 
to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the region. The 
summit has placed the entire peace process in its correct 
framework and stressed the need to achieve progress on all 
tracks of the peace talks. 
  The paper adds: If things go as they should in the 
Washington talks, scheduled to resume next week, then the just 
and comprehensive peace can certainly be achievable. 
  The paper stresses that after the Geneva summit, Israel not 
only failed to change its rejectionist positions, but also 
fabricated new obstacles to place on the path of the forthcoming 
Washington talks. The paper notes that this confirmed that the 
Tel Aviv government continues to refuse to work in accordance 
with the resolutions of international legitimacy and the 
principle of land for peace to achieve the just and 
comprehensive peace in the region. 
  The paper adds: The world, particularly the United States, 
has acknowledged that separate and partial solutions will not 
bring the kind of peace which the world community is seeking to 
achieve. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: It is now imperative for the 
world community, represented by the United Nations, to put an 
end to Israeli disdain for the world's security and peace, and, 
consequently, work on rehabilitating this organization, which 
was founded to spread peace and security in the world. We say 
this because Israel is the only party that has not yet 
implemented any of the UN resolutions. 
  On the same subject and under the headline "Hope," 
AL-THAWRAH 
says: The Geneva summit came in response to the call for the 
just and comprehensive peace, which has been a Syrian objective 
since the launch of the Corrective Movement. It is also true 
that the summit marked a major qualitative action that rose to 
the level of the challenges and aspirations of the nation. 
President al-Asad has carried the worries of the nation, 
embodied its hopes, expressed its objectives, and spoken on its 
behalf. 
  The paper stresses the need to concentrate on rescuing the 
peace process from the state of inaction and stumbling and 
moving it to a new phase, based on a driving force drawn from 
President Bill Clinton's statement that his country is 
determined to do all it can to achieve the just and 
comprehensive peace in the region through the implementation of 
the pertinent UN Security Council resolutions and the 
land-for-peace formula. The paper stresses that such a move 
will raise great hopes that the peace process can be placed on 
the track charted in the Madrid conference to bear fruit this 
year. President Hafiz al-Asad hopes this year will be the year 
of genuine peace, the just and comprehensive peace. 
  The paper also notes that progress in the peace process must 
put an end to the various Israeli methods of deception and 
maneuvering and the avoidance of the principles of the just and 
comprehensive peace and the UN resolutions. 
  AL-THAWRAH concludes its editorial by stressing the 
soundness 
of the Syrian view, saying: Has Syria not said at the early 
stages of the peace process that the battle for peace, is just 
like war, and has its requirements, principles, and conditions? 
Has Syria not fought that battle with the skill of the peerless 
leader who took it upon himself to carry the task of defending 
the rights of the entire nation. Who else but leader al-Asad 
can wrest the nation's rights and correct its march in the most 
difficult circumstances and the most complicated positions?

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] After U.S. President Bill Clinton stressed the 
sincerity of the Syrian approach to achieve a just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East, Israel, through its 
prime minister, has resumed the campaign of casting doubts which 
it began right after the Geneva summit. It claimed that Syria 
has not announced its intentions toward peace frankly, and that 
in light of this ambiguous Syrian stand, Rabin has no choice but 
to hold a referendum on the Golan. Rabin's claims, as well as 
those of other Israeli officials, do not stand up to any test 
because the whole world has applauded Syria's sincere and 
positive stand. In fact, it has termed its stand a basic 
contribution to pushing forward the peace process and to saving 
it from its current stumblings. The truth is that what annoys 
Rabin is Syria's adherence to a just, honorable, and 
comprehensive peace which President al-Asad called the peace of 
the brave. Israel does not want to negotiate on equal footing, 
but wants others to negotiate from a position of weakness, 
submission, and capitulation. Neither does it want an honorable 
peace, but a humiliating peace which entrenches its control of 
the region's resources, and its military and economic hegemony 
on it. From this premise, it seeks to seize as much occupied 
territory as it can for purposes of expansion on the one hand, 
and for purposes of threat and blackmail on the other. Rabin's 
plan to hold referendum on the Golan falls within this 
framework, for the occupiers' referendum does not cancel the 
everlasting fact that Golan is Syrian territory. Neither does it 
abrogate the international law, which does not only recognize 
the Syrian identity of the territory, but also obligates Israel 
to withdraw its forces and to return all the Golan to its owners 
and people. 
  Had occupation been able to cancel the identity of 
territory, 
most of Europe would have turned into German territory, or 
Germany itself would have vanished as a state and nation and 
become part of another country. Instead of harping on doubts 
and intentions, Israel should move to real action for peace and 
implement the land for peace formula. Israel has thus far not 
complied with the implementation of the UN Security Council 
resolutions or with withdrawal from the occupied territories. 
It is talking about concessions, whose nature and dimensions 
are not known to anyone. Withdrawal from the Golan does not mean 
concessions, for the Golan is occupied Syrian territory. It 
means compliance with the UN Security Council resolutions, the 
principles of the international law, and the essence of the 
current peace process. Despite this, Syria offers peace in 
return for withdrawal. Peace is a great event that provides 
security, safety, and tranquility for all the region's states. 
  Since 1948, Israel's rulers have been crying and calling for 
peace with the Arabs. So, why are they trying to evade peace 
today if they are really sincere, and there cries are not simply 
a cover for their hostile and expansionist schemes? The kind of 
peace Syria is calling for is a just and comprehensive peace, 
the true peace which is accepted by peoples. Such peace 
necessitates Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied 
territories and its recognition of Arab rights. Israel's 
acceptance of this peace would provide security for all sides. 
However, separate deals and fragile agreements, which are full 
of arrogance, hegemony, and occupation, do not bring security or 
tranquility. Neither do they safeguard the present and the 
future. Regardless of the Israelis' attempts to cast doubts, 
the ball is in their court, and the world is waiting for them to 
take a stand that will live up to the aspirations and dimensions 
of a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.

  [Text] Addressing the Special Committee of the National 
Assembly on Kashmir in Islamabad today, the prime minister 
assured her government's every assistance in the observance of 
the strike on 5th February to express solidarity with the 
Kashmiri people. The chairman of the committee, Nawabzada 
Nasrullah Khan, presided over the meeting which was attended by 
Ms. Benazir Bhutto. The committee discussed and approved the 
action plan for the observance of the country-wide strike. 
  Referring to the secretary-level talks between Pakistan and 
India, the prime minister said from Pakistan's point of view, 
the talks have been a major success because India for the first 
time agreed to discuss the Kashmir issue as a separate agenda 
item of Pakistan-India parleys. By agreeing to our demand, 
India has also accepted the fact that the Kashmiri people are 
party to the issue which needed to be solved in accordance with 
their wishes. The prime minister said the talks failed to make 
any headway due to Indian intransigence. We had asked India to 
take several steps to reduce repression. India failed to do so, 
leaving no option for Pakistan but to go to the human rights 
commission in Geneva with a view to mobilizing international 
community to pressurize India to improve the human rights 
situation in Kashmir. 
  Ms. Benazir Bhutto regretted the dualism of the United 
Nations in implementation of its resolutions. She said Pakistan 
had supported UN resolutions on the Gulf war and Somalia to 
strengthen the United Nations' role. The prime minister said 
the issue of Kashmir continues to be on the United Nations' 
agenda. There should be one law for all, she said and 
emphasized that if the UN resolutions could be applicable 
elsewhere in the world, they should also be applied in the case 
of the Kashmiri people. 
  Speaking on the occasion, the chairman of the Special 
Committee of the National Assembly on Kashmir, Nawabzada 
Nasrullah Khan, said participation of the prime minister in the 
meeting reflects the importance the government attaches to the 
cause of Kashmir.

  [Text] Prime Minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto will address the 
nation this evening. She will take the nation into her 
confidence on national issues and inform it of the steps the 
government is taking on behalf of Kashmir. The prime minister's 
speech will be broadcast on TV and radio at 1430 GMT. Talking 
to newsmen in Islamabad last evening, the prime minister stated 
categorically that the government will fully support the strike 
called by the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee on 5 
February to protest the atrocities against the Kashmiris in the 
occupied territory. She said that the strike call will be 
considered an appeal by all the parties because the appeal has 
been made by the Kashmir Committee, which is comprised of both 
ruling and opposition members of parliament. She said that her 
government has decided to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN 
human rights organization so as to secure world support for the 
early implementation of the UN resolutions on Kashmir. 
  Ms. Benazir Bhutto said that Pakistan has never refused to 
hold talks with India for a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir 
issue. However, she added, that talks cannot be held in a 
situation in which Kashmiris are being oppressed and supressed 
by Indian forces. She asked how the talks can be held in a 
situation in which arrested Kashmiri leaders have not been 
released and the siege of the Hazratbal shrine is still 
continuing. 
  The prime minister said that 600,000 Indian forces are 
deployed in occupied Kashmir, which means one soldier is 
deployed for every four Kashmiris. Such a situation cannot be 
helpful for a purposeful dialogue. She said that the Indian 
Government should take steps to reduce atrocities in occupied 
Kashmir. 
  Noting the seriousness of the Kashmir problem, Ms. Benazir 
Bhutto said that the issue is linked to future global peace. 
Political stability in the region also depends on the cessation 
of human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. She urged the 
United Nations and other world bodies to consider the Kashmir 
issue as a human rights issue. The prime minister said that it 
would be unjust if the UN resolutions were not implemented. The 
prime minister said that Pakistan has always supported the UN 
resolutions, including those on Kuwait, Somalia, and Bosnia. 
Pakistan hopes that other countries will support it on the 
Kashmir issue. 
  Sheikh Rafiq Ahmad, Pakistan People's Party [PPP] secretary 
general, has said that his party has decided to launch a massive 
campaign to apprise the people of the importance of the rights 
of Kashmiris and the government's policies. In a statement in 
Lahore yesterday, he said that the PPP will hold seminars and 
rallies to focus light on the present situation in occupied 
Kashmir and to draw international attention to the Kashmiri 
brethren. He said that the government has a clear and concrete 
policy on Kashmir.

Article Type:BFN 

  [Text] Islamabad -- The Foreign Office on Saturday [22 Jan] 
reacted with caution to reports that "signals were emanating 
from Moscow regarding its stand on Kashmir which were quite 
disturbing for the Indian government." 
  A senior official commented: "We are checking the report 
which is based on the contents of a confidential letter from 
President Boris Yeltsin to Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. We 
have contacted our High Commissioner in New Delhi, Mr Riaz 
Khokar and, in a couple of days, we should be in a position to 
give a formal reply." 
  The official added that he was surprised that such a 
confidential letter between two heads of state could have found 
its way into a newspaper article. The view in the Foreign 
Office is that if the report is true then the letter may have 
been sent to New Delhi before the Foreign Secretary-level talks 
between the two countries were held early this month. 
  According to the report in the Indian press which was 
prominently displayed in the media here, Russia has expressed 
its concern over grave violations of human rights and asked New 
Delhi to solve the Kashmir problem in accordance with the wishes 
of the Kashmiri people. 
  Earlier when Boris Yeltsin had visited India, he had 
reportedly spoken of Occupied Kashmir as part of India which had 
disturbed Islamabad. It was only after a clarification from 
Moscow that Islamabad announced that there was nothing new in 
Moscow's policy on Occupied Kashmir. 
  One view which prevailed in the Foreign Office was that 
recently the United States and Russia have shown similarity of 
views on many issues. "Both US and Russia want India and 
Pakistan to continue dialogue and both (in the past) have 
approached the two neighbours to come to the negotiating table," 
said the official. "But what we cannot tell right now is 
whether there is really a qualitative change." 
  Earlier, a senior US official Robin Raphael had visited 
Moscow after a visit to Islamabad and the growing US concerns in 
the region were a topic of discussions. Later, during Bill 
Clinton's visit to Moscow recently a joint statement spoke of 
peace in the region. 
  Before waiting for any formal reply from the government, the 
All Parties Hurriyat Conference in a press release has hoped 
that the Russian advice would convince India to stop its reign 
of terror. While applauding the Russian stance on Kashmir, the 
statement said that the change was due to advent of democracy in 
Russia which resulted in this human and conviction-oriented 
stand. 
  Meanwhile, the official at the Foreign Office said that 
there 
was some indication that the six non-papers that India had 
promised to send to Pakistan would arrive here sooner than 
expected. "Earlier, the Indian Foreign Office had said that they 
would send them after nearly four months," commented the 
official. 
  The Foreign Office says that New Delhi had to do so because 
Islamabad had seized the initiative and sent them two non-papers.

  [Excerpt] Islamabad -- While the question of F-16 aircraft 
to Pakistan Air Force is still in doldrums, the Russian 
government has offered to Pakistan the sale of SU-27, and MiG-29 
planes which they claim are equivalent if not superior to the 
American jet fighters, well informed official sources told 
PAKISTAN OBSERVER here Friday [21 Jan]. 
  The Russian manufacturers, [words indistinct] team of Air 
Force experts and navigators to visit Russia to evaluate, 
conduct flying tests and examine the battle worthiness of the 
aircraft offered to Pakistan. The Russian authorities have 
asked that the Evaluation Team of the Air Force should visit 
their country between January 15 to February 15. 
  It is believed that the Air Force has mentioned that SU-27 
and the MiG-29 aircraft must be equipped with air-to-air 
missiles, air defence system inclusive of radars, both 
high-powered and low-looking, and air defence weapons. 
  The invitation from the Russian government which indicates 
their willingness to provide these sensitive aircraft is indeed 
a breakthrough in the relations between Pakistan and Russia, the 
sources said. 
  It would be worthwhile to state the Indian government had an 
agreement with the former Soviet Union restraining the latter 
from supplying any defence equipment to Pakistan. After the 
dismemberment to the Soviet Union this covenant continued to be 
in operation. The Pakistan Foreign Office had been making 
hectic efforts to run a new leaf in the relations between 
Pakistan and Russia. The recent intimation from Russia is 
indeed a reflection of the fact that the snow has melted. 
  Although nothing can be said for certain but it is believed 
that Pakistan Air Force will shortly select its team of experts 
to proceed to Russia to evaluate the aircraft. The latest 
negotiations would [words indistinct] of F-16 aircraft but also 
the offer by France and Sweden. 
  What is interesting to note in this connection is that the 
Russian offer includes technology and training offer guaranteed 
supply of spares and accessories together with maintenance of 
the aircraft. 
  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is visiting Moscow this year 
and it is expected that before her departure the homework on 
this subject will be completed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorials: "Arab Nationals Living in Pakistan"] </F>
  [Text] Mustafa Hanafi, the Egyptian ambassador to Pakistan, 
has said in an interview that his government has formally asked 
Pakistan to arrest and extradite 10 persons who have been 
involved in subversive and terrorist activities in Egypt. These 
persons include an Egyptian named (Muhammad Mustari) who was 
involved in an attack on the Egyptian prime minister. 
  During the Afghan holy war, youths of several Arab countries 
had fought, along with the Afghan mojahedin, against the Soviet 
Union and the Communist Afghan forces and the United States had 
been providing them arms. However, after the end of the Afghan 
holy war, there was no justification for those Arab nationals to 
overstay in Pakistan and the Pakistan Government was duty-bound 
to send them back to their homelands under an appropriate action 
plan. The Pakistani nation recognizes the services of these 
Arab mojahedin, but the Pakistan Government cannot provide any 
support and assistance for the struggle they wish to launch in 
their respective countries, nor would the people of Pakistan 
like to see Pakistani soil being used for their respective 
political battles. They create problems for us and defame 
Pakistan in the international community. Therefore, these Arab 
nationals can be requested not to create problems and 
difficulties for us and leave for their respective homelands 
immediately. If these people have any differences with the 
governments of their respective countries, Pakistan is not at 
all interested in them nor is it our problem. The Pakistan 
government ought to say the same thing to the Arab governments 
that we had neither invited their nationals nor are we providing 
them shelter. In view of the situation that has developed along 
our northwestern border, it would be only hypothetical to say 
that these Arab nationals are still staying in Peshawar. They 
may be living under the umbrella of any Afghan organization, but 
Pakistan is being held accountable for them. We should, 
therefore, deal with this entire problem very cautiously.

  [Excerpt] As a result of an attack by armed men on a 
gathering of Shiite Friday [21 Jan] worshippers in Pakistan's 
Punjab Province, at least 20 worshippers were killed or injured. 
Following the attack, the leader of Pakistan's [Shiite] Ja'fari 
movement issued a statement condemning the attack and declaring 
three days of public mourning. Our colleague Khameneh reports 
from Pakistan: 
  [Khameneh] As a result of an attack by armed men on a 
gathering of Shiite Friday worshippers in Pakistan's Punjab 
Province, at least 20 worshippers were martyred or injured. In 
the course of the attack, four armed men, who were riding on two 
motorcycles, threw a grenade at a crowd of worshippers in a 
mosque in the Mozafargar region and opened fire using 
Kalashnikovs. As a result, five of the worshippers were killed 
and at least 15 severely injured. 
  Pakistan's Ja'fari movement issued a statement tonight, 
condemning this crime and declaring three days of public 
mourning to honor the memory of those martyred. 
  Allameh Seyyed Sajed Ali Naqavi, the leader of Pakistan's 
Shiites, also issued a statement severely condemning the savage 
attack and describing it as an act of terrorism perpetrated by 
sectarian elements. In the statement, the leader of Pakistan's 
Ja'fari movement described the Wahhabi association known as the 
Sahabah Corps as the main element behind fanning sectarian 
disputes in that country and warned that lack of due care and 
the lack of a rapid response by the government to the elements 
behind such crimes may evoke a strong reaction from Pakistan's 
Shiite community. [passage omitted]

  [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton received His Majesty 
King Husayn and Her Majesty Queen Nur at the White House 
yesterday evening. Afterward, the two leaders held a closed 
meeting, which was followed by an expanded meeting attended by 
several officials on both sides. 
  The conferees reviewed various regional and international 
issues and his majesty gave a detailed explanation of Jordan's 
position on the peace process, particularly concerning the 
recent developments of this process. He affirmed Jordan's 
commitment to achieving a comprehensive, lasting, and just peace 
in the region in accordance with the formula of the Madrid 
conference based on Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 
425. 
  They also discussed various aspects of relations between the 
two friendly countries and the need to consolidate these 
relations in order to reach the highest levels of cooperation in 
various fields. 
  In welcoming His Majesty King Husayn to the United States, 
the U.S. President stressed the deep historic relations between 
the two countries, and appreciated his majesty's continued 
efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East. 
  The U.S. President also commended the Jordanian democratic 
march and expressed appreciation for his majesty's efforts to 
entrench and enhance it. He referred to the great efforts he 
personally is making to reduce Jordan's economic difficulties 
and to help Jordan overcome these difficulties--the foremost 
being its foreign indebtedness--by supporting the Jordanian 
economy. 
  President Clinton affirmed U.S. interest in supporting and 
promoting the Jordanian Armed Forces, and stressed his 
appreciation of Jordan's prominent role in maintaining security

<F P=106> ["Transcript" of King Husayn's interview on CNN's "Evans and </F>
Novak" program conducted in Washington; broadcast on 22 January] 
  [Text] Q: Do you think President Clinton and the United 
States ought to take a more active role in trying to resolve 
this impasse over the West Bank, Jericho and Gaza that 'Arafat 
is having with Israel? 
  A: I believe that the United States is already taking a very 
active role in trying to bring about peace in the region. And I 
hope that we'll see some results soon. 
  Q: But, Your Majesty, our secretary of state, Mr. 
Christopher, has just recently said in Oslo, where he went to 
the funeral of the foreign minister of Norway, that this is not 
the U.S. role. This is the role of Israel and the Palestinians. 
Do you agree with that? Shouldn't the U.S. do more, sir? And 
did you not advise the president to do more when you saw him on 
Friday [21 January]? 
  A: Obviously the United States is a very important element 
in helping parties in the region arrive at peace. But in terms 
of the Oslo agreement, it was an agreement reached between 
Israel and the PLO and the Palestinians. And I really hope that 
they can work out all the details that are needed with the help 
and support of the United States, and all of us, in fact. 
  Q: But you don't want President Clinton and the State 
Department to do any more in an effort to push this process 
ahead than they're doing now. Is that what you're telling us, 
sir? 
  A: What I'd like is exactly the opposite. I'd like 
continued interest and concern and the spirit of a partnership 
to continue to exist and manifest itself in the difficult times 
ahead at this year [as published], very crucial moment. 
  Q: Your Majesty, Yasir 'Arafat, the head of the PLO, has 
come in for some criticism on the way he has conducted the 
negotiations with the Israelis. Do you personally have 
confidence in Mr. 'Arafat? 
  A: I think that this is up to the Palestinians to decide, 
his Palestinian constituency. But I have tried to advise him, 
to the best of my ability, to try to realise that he has a 
changed role now. He represents Palestinains both in the 
occupied territories and in the diaspora. They should all be a 
part of the coming phase in terms of their views and feelings, 
particularly those who have endured 26 years of occupation; and 
at the same time, hopefully that we'll be able to delegate 
responsibility so that people are able to see progress and 
movement in dealing with the many problems that should be 
addressed, particularly when withdrawal begins. There has to be 
immediately a qualitative change in the lives of people that 
means the beginning of peace. 
  Q: Do you think he has taken that advice that he should 
alter and change his role? 
  A: I believe that essentially this is what he has heard from 
me in the frankest possible way. He has also heard it from and 
is hearing it from many friends of Palestine, the Palestinian 
cause, and Palestinians themselves. 
  Q: There have been published reports that many Arab leaders 
are unhappy with Yasir 'Arafat for demanding Palestinian 
independence. Do you share that point of view? 
  A: No, I don't share that point of view at all. I believe 
that it is the right of the Palestinians to decide what their 
future fate should be and that is a achoice, as far as we are 
concerned in Jordan, that was made in 1974 at the Rabat Arab 
Summit when all the Arab states supported Palestinians and 
recognising the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of the 
people of Palestine. And we accepted that and have supported it 
ever since. 
  Q: One last question on that point, sir. It's been reported 
that you had issued a virtual ultimatum to Yasir 'Arafat, saying 
that he should be more conciliatory, more cooperative in the 
negotiations. Is that true? 
  A: We have had recently some very frank exchanges, and I 
hope that they have helped. Certainly they have helped in 
getting us to a point where we have agreement on a number of 
essential elements regarding Palestinian-Jordanian relations and 
our role in helping the people in the occupied territories 
regarding banks, for example, that are in the open. 
  Q: Your Majesty, the foreign minister of Syria, Mr. 
al-Shara', journeyed to Amman, the capital of Jordan, in the 
last few days to report on his meeting, on President al-Asad's 
meeting with President Clinton, to your brother Crown Prince 
Hasan. Tell us, sir, what did the two presidents agree to? 
  A: I have the impression that the meeting went very, very 
well, that there were very frank talks. And I believe that the 
Syrian position has been made clear by President al-Asad in the 
terms of a real desire and commitment to the cause of a just, 
durable peace, a comprehensive peace; but also that Syria is 
prepared to ratify a peace treaty when it recovers its lost 
territory and when that problem is solved. 
  Q: Well, do you think it surprising, in view of what you 
just said, that the Israeli government, from Prime Minister 
Rabin on down, has been very, very cautious in assessing the 
Clinton-al-Asad meeting in Geneva? They don't seem very 
impressed. 
  A: I believe that the results of the meeting were very 
encouraging. This is what I've heard from President al-Asad. 
I'd spoken to him before and I have heard from him since, and 
also from President Clinton, whom I had the pleasure of meeting 
a short while ago. 
  Q: So can you tell us, sir, that you would expect some kind 
of beginning of serious negotiations for Israel to get off the 
Golan Heights and for Syria to give Israel true peace in the 
next few weeks?" 
  A: I hope that this would be the case. 
  Q: Hope. But what's your prediction? 
  A: I don't have all the details, but I believe that 
negotiations are going to begin very, very shortly. And I think 
they will be at much more serious and determined level. 
  Q: Just one more on that, Your Majesty. Are you convinced 
that Israel, in fact, will withdraw from the Golan Heights 
entirely? Are you convinced of that, sir? 
  A: I know that the Golan Heights are of a Syrian territory. 
And obviously the question is territory for peace. That's part 
of 242. But beyond that, how it will be worked out is something 
for the negotiators, I believe, to ascertain. 
  Q: You met on Friday with President Clinton. You have been 
critical in the past of some American Presidents for tilting too 
much toward israel. How do you assess President Clinton in that 
regard? 
  A: I am most impressed. I believe that he is a genuine 
person. He has already got at the tips of his hands all the 
information regarding the area. He has studied. He's looked 
into all the problems, the different points of view. And I 
believe that he is determined to do whatever he can, together 
with the United States, to help bring about a just, honourable, 
lasting peace in our region. 
  Q: Do you think he has a mindset that is even-handed as 
between the Arab side and the israeli side? 
  A: I believe he has great integrity and he's able to see the 
different views. And the challenge, I suppose, is to try to 
reconcile them in the times ahead. 
  Q: Continuing to look at the overview, sir, is this a--have 
the Arabs and the Israelis embarked on an irreversible procedure 
toward peace, or are we at a critical phase now that it could go 
either way, in your opinion? 
  A: As far as I am concerned, I am totally committed for it 
to going one way, and that is the way towardes peace. I think 
that if it goes any other way, it would be the end for the 
entire region. 
  Q: It would be a disaster? 
  A: It would be a disaster. 
  Q: Well, let me ask you this, Your Majesty. If the 
PLO-Israeli talks cannot get back on track and there can't be a 
deal on Jericho and Gaza and the beginnings of Palestinian 
independence, will you sign a treaty with Israel, between Jordan 
and Israel? Can you wait forever for the Palestinians? 
  A: Sir, we started at the same point in time. We started at 
Madrid; we, the Palestinians and all the other parties to the 
conflict. Later on, Oslo saw the Palestinians move ahead and 
assume their own responsibilities regarding their rights on 
their soil. We supported that. We ratified the agenda. So we 
are moving on our own, really. We are looking at this agenda 
and we hope that we will cover all the items there. 
  We have a difference, I believe, with Israel in the fact 
that 
we have been invited to ratify a peace treaty. We would like to 
see what that peace treaty contains, and we would like to work 
up from the issues that are there to have the crowning 
achievement be the peace treaty. When we are ready and when our 
efforts are successful and completed, I believe we would have 
peace. 
  Q: Would you say to us, sir, there is no chance of Jordan 
ever signing a separate peace treaty with Israel under any 
conditions if the negotiations on the West Bank and Gaza are 
unsuccessful? 
  A: I certainly hope they will be successful, and I certainly 
hope at the same time that we will be able to cover the 
Jordanian-Israeli differences and problems that beset both 
sides. And obviously there is a dimension that links us to the 
Palestinian- Israeli effort at this stage. I hope things will 
move, and I'm sure they will move. 
  Q: Your Majesty, excuse me. It is impossible that you 
would sign a treaty with Israel without progress and some kind 
of a solution on the West Bank. Is that what you're telling us? 
  A: Let me put it another way. I believe that a solution is 
coming, and I believe that we will ratify a peace treaty 
probably at the end of this year or maybe next year. 
  Q: Your Majesty, one of the low points, perhaps the lowest 
points in the long and friendly relationship between your 
Kingdom and the United States, came during the Gulf war. Do you 
feel now that the United States should take a more positive 
attitude in trying to make peace with Iraq and Saddam Husayn, or 
do you think that's impossible? 
  A: I wouldn't care to comment on this particular problem. I 
certainly have worried and have been very, very deeply concerned 
about the fate of the people of Iraq so far in their suffering 
that grows. But I'm sure this problem will be resolved. 
  Q: Are you ever in touch with Saddam Husayn? 
  A: I haven't been in touch recently. 
  Q: One other point, Your Majesty. The Iranian government 
has sent a very large diplomatic mission to your country, to 
Amman, the capital of Jordan. it's headed by an ambassador who 
was active in the takeover of the U.S. embassy in 1979 and who, 
I am told, participated in the planning of the attack on the 
U.S. embassy in Beirut. is there any chance sir, as I'm told, 
that you would like that mission from Iran reduced because the 
fundamentalists who occupy that embassy are not for peace, they 
are against peace? 
  A: Nothing has happened in that direction so far. And the 
ambassador is in Jordan and he's behaving as an ambassador 
should so far. But we are watching, obviously, the dimension of 
our relations with Iran. We would have liked them to be based 
on an agreement, clear at the highest levels as to where the 
green lines are, where the red lines are, where our differences 
are. And I hope that this will come at some point. But in the 
meantime, we will not permit our country to be jeopardised in 
terms of its internal sovereignty. 
  Q: Are they agitating? 
  A: I don't think they are at the moment. We haven't seen 
anything that would suggest that. 
  Q: Your Majesty, the United States secretary of commerce, 
Ron Brown, was in Cairo on Thursday and he said the following: 
"The Arab Boycott of Israel is coming apart." Do you agree with 
that? 
  A: I think inevitably it will come about in te context of 
progress towards achieving peace. But there are several areas 
that have to be covered. If you talk about, for example, Jordan 
and Israel, we have to work out a balance in terms of our trade 
and our -- they have a protectionist approach towards their 
products. [sentence as published] They have denied us the 
chance that they would wish for their products to come into our 
area. All these things have to be worked out, particularly with 
regard to the Palestinian dimension. But regarding foreign 
companies operating in the area, I think that is changing and 
altering in the right direction. 
  Q: Do you think that progress can be made there before an 
agreement, peace agreements are signed? 
  A: Regarding outside companies? 
  Q: Yes. 
  A: I believe it's happening gradually. 
  Q: Your Majesty--excuse me, sir. Your Majesty, B.B. 
Netanyahu, the head of the Likud party, was in Washington this 
past week and made the statement that if he were prime minister, 
he would not return one inch of land on the Golan Heights to 
Syria. Would you tell us sir, do you think a switch in party 
control in Israel would endanger the peace process? 
  A: If this is their approach, obviously it would. 
  Q: It would. 
  A: It would yes. 
  Q: Could you amplify that, sir? 
  A: Well, then it would mean that a very serious obstacle 
would be placed in the path of peace. And what we are searching 
for is a comprehensive peace in the region, which includes 
Syria, lebanon, Jordan, the Palestinian dimension, Israel, 
together with everyone else. 
  Q: And Prime Minister Rabin's immediate political future 
depends on success, doesn't it? 
  A: I believe that.

  [Text] Doha, 23 Jan (WAKH)--Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has said that Jordan has reiterated to 
U.S. President Bill Clinton its position on the peace process, 
which is based on the need to achieve comprehensive, just, and 
durable peace on the basis of the Madrid conference formula, 
which is grounded in UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, 
and 425. 
  In a statement to the newspaper AL-RAYAH published here 
today, al-Majali, who is accompanying King Husayn on the 
latter's current visit to Washington, indicated that there is

this issue. 
  In reply to a question, Dr. al-Majali expressed full 
satisfaction with the the economic agreement recently signed 
between Jordan and the PLO, saying: "This agreement is 
realistic. It will yield immediate benefits to the Palestinian 
side."

  [Text] Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has said 
that during his visit to Washington His Majesty King Husayn 
discussed with the U.S. Administration all aspects and tracks of 
the peace process. 
  Al-Majali said his majesty emphasized Jordan's commitment to 
the principle of a comprehensive lasting, and just solution on 
the basis of UN resolutions. 
  In a telephone interview with the Qatari newspaper AL-RAYAH 
in Washington, al-Majali said consultation between Jordan, 
Syria, and the other Arab parties is based on the comprehensive 
nature of the solution and the realization of peace on the basis 
of the resolutions of international legitimacy and the 
land-for-peace principle. 
  The prime minister described the U.S. role in the 
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations as effective and positive, 
pointing out that the U.S. Administration, led by President 
Clinton, is playing the role of an honest broker between the 
Arabs and Israel. 
  On the recent Jordanian-Palestinian agreement, Dr. al-Majali 
expressed full satisfaction with what has been reached, pointing 
out that coordination between the two sides is continuing in all 
fields. 
  As for Jordan's relations with the Gulf states, the prime 
minister said Jordan is honestly and sincerely seeking the best 
possible relations with all Arab countries, especially the 
brothers in the Arab Gulf states. 
  The prime minister welcomed the agreement reached on 
resolving the political crisis in Yemen, pointing out the 
Jordanian pan-Arab constants in the Arab political action.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Our Constant Political Principles for a Just </F>
and Comprehensive Peace"] 
  [Text] After his meeting with U.S. President Clinton at 
the White House yesterday, His Majesty King Husayn was eager to 
stress Jordan's support for all efforts being made to achieve a 
just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the Middle East. His 
majesty also stressed the call to achieve this objective quickly. 
  The Jordanian-U.S. summit was a great opportunity to 
exchange 
views on developments of the Middle East peace process and the 
results of the contacts and meetings held to promote this 
process, including the recent Syrian-U.S. meeting in Geneva, in 
order to plan for the next move in the upcoming bilateral talks 
aimed at achieving a peace that would secure the Arab rights and 
entrench the bases of security, stability, and cooperation in 
this turbulent region. 
  Now that efforts are focusing on achieving the real 
objectives of the peace process, laxity in the negotiations and 
removing them from their true course would create more obstacles 
and complications that might waste this precious opportunity and 
push the entire region back into a whirlpool of endless 
conflict. The repercussions and threats of such a conflict 
would undermine regional and world security. 
  Thus, King Husayn was eager to stress the importance of 
gaining time and speeding up the peace steps and translating 
them into realities on the ground, based on international 
legitimacy and its resolutions in a way that will secure a 
comprehensive and just peace that would return the occupied 
territories and the usurped rights to their owners in addition 
to establishing an equitable, balanced, and fair political and 
economic order throughout the Middle East. 
  With regard to the Jordanian-Palestinian coordination, his 
majesty's emphasis on this positive coordination as part of a 
comprehensive peace embodied the continued Jordanian support for 
the Palestinian people and their legitimate representative, the 
PLO, to regain their territories, rights, and sovereignty. 
  The real desire for peace according to the principles and 
terms of reference of the Madrid conference, which His Majesty 
King Husayn and His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad stressed 
in their meetings with President Clinton, as well as the Arab 
parties' response to the bases of such a peace, with all its 
political, economic, and legitimate dimensions, would both place 
the United States before its moral and political 
responsibilities to promote the peace process and remove it from 
the procrastinations and deviation which Israel employs in each 
phase of negotiations and on all tracks. Such procrastination, 
however, has not yet succeeded in foiling the peace process or 
pushing it to a deadlock. Israel wants such a deadlock, but the 
United States has thus far ignored this.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "In Order To Change Arab View of U.S. Strength"] </F>
  [Text] With the approach of the Jordanian-U.S. summit, 
which was described by the prime minister as important in terms 
of its timing and its implications, we would like to remind the 
U.S. Administration of the reasons for the way the Jordanian 
people and the Arab peoples view the United States, despite the 
distance that separates us. Over the past few decades, U.S. 
policy has dealt with us through Israel's viewpoint and backed 
aggression from which we are still suffering. Whenever we try 
to show our admiration for the U.S. Administration's interest in 
human rights and its rejection of violence and terrorism, we 
find out that it is still far from being fair in the way it 
takes an interest in these rights and in the way it defines 
violence and terrorism. 
  Instead of being a source of inspiration for many peoples to 
promote the principles of freedom on which its first revolution 
was founded the United States has become, in the view of many 
peoples, as well as our Arab people in particular, an example of 
a dominating force supporting the killer against the victim. 
  Today, as the United States calls for bringing about peace 
and stability in our region, it is expected to prove that it 
really wants such a fair, comprehensive, and lasting peace. 
However, we reaffirm that the current image is not impossible 
to change, particularly if the United States eliminates the 
reasons behind this image by getting Israel to change its 
negotiating position on peace, which will not succeed unless it 
is just and comprehensive, and by ending Jordan's suffering and 
the blockade, which is deeply affecting Jordan and its people 
and which is harming the fraternal Iraqi people following the 
Gulf crisis, as the U.S. Administration knows well. 
  Jordan, severely harmed by the region's events since the 
establishment of Israel, expects the United States to turn over 
a new leaf and compensate Jordan for all its burdens and the 
damage caused to it over decades of crises and conflict, in 
which the United States was biased in violation of its declared 
principles of freedom, human rights, and the need for security 
and stability. We hope that this superpower will not remain a 
captive of its own power isolated from the human dimension, 
without which power means tyranny and cannot be beautified in 
the eyes of nations, regardless of its size.

<F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "Jordan Confirms Its Request To </F>
Reduce Number of Iranian Diplomats"] 
  [Excerpt] Amman--Official Jordanian sources yesterday 
confirmed Jordan's request to Iran to reduce the number of its 
diplomats in Amman in the wake of the attack on the house of 
Jordanian Ambassador to Tehran Yasin Istanbuli. 
  The sources told AL-HAYAH that Talal al-Hasan, minister of 
state for foreign affairs, had summoned the Iranian ambassador 
and informed him of the Jordanian request to reduce the number 
of Iranian diplomats at the embassy as a result of the attack on 
the Jordanian ambassador's house some two months ago. The 
sources pointed out that among the other reasons for the 
Jordanian request is that the number of Iranian diplomats in 
Amman "exceeds by far the number of Jordanian diplomats in 
Tehran." 
  Well-informed sources have said that there are more than 30 
Iranian diplomats in Amman, compared with three Jordanian 
diplomats in Tehran. It was not possible to learn the name of 
the Iranian ambassador in Amman. When AL-HAYAH contacted the 
embassy, the employee on duty told AL-HAYAH to contact the 
embassy again on Saturday because he did not have the authority 
to reveal the ambassador's name. The authoritative sources said 
that the Jordanian Government "was not satisfied with the way 
Iranian authorities handled the attack on the Jordanian 
ambassador's house." They pointed out that the ambassador's 
house in Tehran was burgled two months ago. The sources also 
emphasized that Jordan has been seeking to improve relations 
with Iran since diplomatic relations were restored in 1991, 10 
years after their severance following the breakout of the 
Iraq-Iran war. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Amman--AL-RA'Y has learned that the Jordanian 
Foreign Ministry has asked the Iranian Foreign Ministry to 
reduce the number of its diplomats in the Iranian Embassy in 
Amman. 
  There are more than 35 diplomats in the Iranian Embassy in 
Amman, while the Jordanian Embassy staff in Tehran numbers no 
more than three. 
  The Jordanian Foreign Ministry's request, which aims at 
creating a balance between the two countries' diplomatic 
missions, will not affect the existing fraternal relations.

  [Text] An informed Jordanian source yesterday denied 
reports that Jordanian forces will be sent to Yemen in the 
coming weeks. The source said these reports are groundless. 
  The source added that Jordan is primarily interested in the 
perpetuation of security and stability in fraternal Yemen and is 
eager to seek an appropriate negotiated solution to the Yemeni 
crisis within the framework of dialogue and understanding among 
the Yemeni leaders. 
  The source emphasized that the Jordanian Arab Army will not 
hesitate to come to the brothers assistance if needed; that it 
is an army for all Arabs, and that it works only for Arabs 
interests. The source said: The issue at hand is that the 
Yemeni leaders have asked the Jordanian Arab Army's general 
command to offer its expertise and advice within the framework 
of a comprehensive plan to reorganize the Yemeni Army's units. 
Thus, during Royal Court Chief al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir's 
visit to Yemen last Monday, Staff Major General 'Id Kamil 
al-Rawdan, assistant chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for 
Operations and Training, accompanied al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir 
to study the Yemeni plan in this respect.

  [Excerpt] Acting Prime Minister Dr. Ma'n Abu-Nuwar has 
denied that Jordan has signed any accord with the PLO other than 
the economic accord which was signed on 7 January. This 
statement, which he made to SAWT AL-SHA'B, is contrary to what 
was reported by news agencies and some papers that a security 
accord was recently signed between the Jordanian and Palestinian 
sides. 
  Mahmud 'Abbas, also known as Abu-Mazin and a member of the 
PLO Executive Committee, said--in a telephone interview SAWT 
AL-SHA'B conducted with him in Tunis--that the Palestinian 
leadership had discussed the draft security accord prepared by 
the territory, border, and security committee, which is 
considered one of the most important committees of the Joint 
Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Committee and which was formed 
before the Palestinian-Israeli accord was signed. He added that 
the Palestinian leadership sent the draft security accord to 
Major General Fahkri Shaqquraq, chief of Palestinian 
intelligence, who is currently in Amman. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Across the country, tomorrow's event is the national 
consensus conference on which the Algerian people are pinning 
high hopes to bring the country out of its current crisis. The 
national conference crowns numerous rounds of talks in the 
framework of a national dialogue. Various political and social 
forces took part in this dialogue, except representatives of the 
dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] which the National 
Dialogue Commission had promised to involve in the last round of 
talks. However, nothing has been revealed yet on the results of 
the contacts which the Dialogue Commission has held with the FIS. 
  On the eve of the start of the national consensus 
conference, 
numerous political parties continue to announce their 
participation in this conference. Thus the Islamic Society 
Movement, HAMAS [Islamic Resistance Movement], has announced its 
participation. The leader of the movement, Mr. Mahfouz Nahnah, 
said at a press conference that the participation of his party 
was aimed at achieving several objectives, one of which was to 
contribute to the containment of the current crisis. Mr. 
Mahfouz Nahnah explains these objectives to our colleague Ahmed 
Khida: 
  [Begin Nahnah recording] The executive bureau of HAMAS 
movement, which has been appointed by the movement's national 
consultative council, has decided to take part in the national 
conference in order to achieve the following objectives: 
  1. To contribute effectively to the containment of Algeria's 
stifling crisis. 
  2. To find suitable and practical formulas which would 
lead to the legitimacy with the drawing up of an agenda for the 
next elections. 
  3. To discuss formulas aimed at tackling the security 
crisis and find ways to ensure political detente through 
political means. 
  4. To expose the conspiracies, the manipulations and the 
methods aimed at excluding some people, aggravating the crisis 
and maintaining the status quo in the service of narrow 
interests, be they the interests of the authorities or those of 
the parties. Narrow interests are pursued at the expense of the 
blood of the innocent people, their property, and honor and at 
the expense of the country's higher interest. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Four of Algeria's six main political parties are 
boycotting the national conference which opens today. Former 
President Ben Bella's Movement for Democracy in Algeria has also 
decided not to attend. [passage omitted] 
  All the boycotting parties have denounced the conference as 
a 
put up job with its outcome decided in advance by the 
authorities. Hocine Ait Ahmed, president [as heard] of the 
Socialist Forces Front, had this to say: 
  [Begin Ahmed recording] The conference organized by the 
authorities is a pseudo-conference. I believe that not only can 
we not conceive of a transition based on a fire that is raging 
and spreading but also that it would be too facile and stupid 
not to involve the Islamic movement in the government, thus 
forcing them into an underground existence and turning them into 
heroes with clean hands. 
  For the past 30 years in Algeria we have not been engaging 
in 
politics but rather in plotting and scheming. This national 
conference has been brought about solely to endorse what has 
already been decided behind the scenes, by what I call the 
family conclave. Organizations and persons determined beforehand 
are going to be imposed on us. What is being pursued is a 
policy of the fait accompli, hence the utmost contempt in which 
it is held by Algerian public opinion and by the political 
parties. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with ambassador to Israel Muhammad </F>
Basyuni in Tel Aviv by Shihatah Abu-al-Majd in Cairo; place and 
date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Abu-al-Majd] Good morning Mr. Ambassador. 
  [Basyuni] Good morning. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] The timing of Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa's 
visit to Israel is significant. It is part of extensive 
Egyptian activity to promote the Middle East peace process and 
coincides with the start of Arab-Israel talks in Washington. 
What were the results of this visit? 
  [Basyuni] Actually it was a successful visit, during which 
all the outstanding problems concerning the borders, crossing 
points, the area of Jericho, security arrangements and movement 
on the roads in Gaza were reviewed. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Specifically, was there any response from 
Israel on meeting the Palestinians' demands as far as these 
issues are concerned? 
  [Basyuni] There is response from both sides, because both 
are 
doing their best to overcome the difficulties. Thus, there is a 
mutual desire to reach an agreement. It is not an easy problem. 
The path is not strewn with roses, but is full of problems. But 
with effort, perseverance, and mutual desire, Egypt is trying to 
reach solutions satisfactory to both sides. The problem has 
persisted for a very long time, and we are trying to find a 
solution to it so that we can start implementing the agreement 
and begin the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Then, the 
Palestinian authorities can begin to assume power on the ground. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Minister Musa naturally has brought back 
Israel's views to convey to President Mubarak and the 
Palestinian leadership... 
  [Basyuni, interrupting] Minister Musa has managed to bring 
the views closer over the crossing points themselves and the 
procedures to be followed there, while maintaining the dignity 
of the Palestinians passing through them. He discussed very 
minute and complicated details and tried to solve these 
problems; he discussed the best way to cross, and how to 
increase the area of Jericho as much as possible. All these 
issues were discussed in detail by Minister Musa. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] You said Minister Musa was successful in his 
discussions of these issues. What tangible effect this will 
have? 
  [Basyuni] Both sides accept the Egyptian views. As you know, 
we are not negotiating on behalf of the Palestinians or 
Israelis. We are trying to bridge the gap in views, offer new 
ideas, and use our past negotiating, security, and 
administration experience to give advice and try to overcome the 
problems in a bid to achieve the desired goal. As for the talks 
themselves, president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres will resume them in Switzerland on Saturday night 
[29 January]. 
  [Abu-al-Majd] Let us move to the Israeli-Syrian track and 
Rabin's proposal to hold a referendum on withdrawal from the 
Golan. How do the Israeli parliamentarians and ordinary people 
view this proposal? 
  [Basyuni] Actually I do not want to interfere in Israel's 
internal affairs or political map. I will give you my own 
personal views. Proposing a referendum is very shrewd. The 
objective is to gain the support of those who object to a 
withdrawal from the Golan, whether they are from the ruling 
coalition or the opposition. Concerning the ruling coalition, 
there are approximately seven Labor MK's [Knesset members] who 
object to full withdrawal from the Golan. There are also six 
MK's from the Shas religious movement who back the government 
but are not part of it. 
  Rabin said that should an agreement involving a major 
withdrawal from the Golan or abandonment of settlements be 
reached, he would opt for a referendum. This means that Prime 
Minister Rabin intends to take steps and make decisions that go 
far beyond the Labor Party's electoral program. Thus, his 
promising a referendum indicates that the decisions he is about 
to make will far exceed the electoral program. In such a case, 
the opposition cannot continue to object to a full withdrawal 
from the Golan until an agreement is reached, because Mr. Rabin 
promised he would opt for a referendum if an agreement involving 
a substantial withdrawal from the Golan is reached [sentence as 
heard]. 
  I believe that if an agreement is reached, it will be a 
package deal based on a comprehensive solution. By this I mean 
that it will not be an agreement with Syria alone, but there 
will also be an agreement with Lebanon, Jordan, as well as on 
full self-rule for the Palestinians. Thus, Israeli citizens 
will be voting in a referendum on a comprehensive peace deal -- 
full peace with Syria, with Jordan, with Lebanon, and full 
self-rule, as well as mutually acceptable security arrangements 
in exchange for their full withdrawal from the Golan and the 
other occupied Arab territories.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Egypt has renewed 
its efforts to resolve the Lockerbie crisis between Libya and 
the West. It had stopped these efforts for about a month after 
the disappearance of former Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur 
al-Kikhya. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Egyptian Information 
Minister Safwat al-Sharif's sudden visit to Tripoli and his 
meeting with Libyan Leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi were part of 
these efforts. 
  According to informed sources in Cairo, Egypt conveyed to 
Libya France's willingness to start a dialogue with Libya on 
means of resolving the crisis. That is what French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe had conveyed to Cairo, during his recent 
visit, in response to the Egyptian proposals calling for a 
direct dialogue similar to that held with Britain at the 
beginning of the crisis. 
  The sources also revealed that, in a reply message from 
Chairman al-Qadhdhafi to Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, Libya 
officially confirmed that it had nothing to do with al-Kikhya's 
disappearance and that it was perfectly willing to cooperate 
with Egypt to find out what happened to him. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in Banghazi on 18 </F>
January -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God. First I would like to greet 
you, brothers, and thank you for the glorious reception you gave 
me and with which we challenge the enemies. The welcome given by 
the people of Banghazi is one of the important messages which we 
said we would be sending to the enemies during these days. 
[applause] These days we see the entire world focusing its 
attention on what is going on in Libya. We receive delegations 
from Arab and foreign countries. They all tell us how their 
countries are surprised by the revolutionary phenomenon in Libya 
and the Libyan people's challenge and revolution; official as 
well as popular delegations come to Libya and draw our attention 
to the fact that the entire world is aware of what is going on 
in the land of Libya these days. Some of them say that this came 
as a surprise to them and to the world. As far as we are 
concerned it is not a surprise, as we know ourselves and know 
the times when we come out to challenge or to sacrifice 
ourselves. Some time ago there were U.S. and British bases and 
the Italians in Libya; Libya was totally subjugated in 1970--in 
1969--to foreign control. Libya had signed a 99-year treaty 
which allowed American forces to be stationed on Libyan soil. 
The treaty was signed with [King] Idris al-Sanusi; its effect 
was that until it ran dry the oil would remain in the hands of 
the American companies and one British company. They forgot that 
they were occupying a land that belonged to martyrs, heroes, and 
honorable people whose families fought the Italians for long 
years with limited resources. The Americans, the British, and 
the West have no farsightedness; they do not ready history. They 
are always deceived and are always taken by suprise by the 
people. [passage omitted] Even when they established their 
bases in Libya and signed a 99-year treaty -- look how they 
disregarded and belittled us. How could they sign a 99-year 
treaty which would allow them to remain in Libya? How come? Has 
Libya no people? Has Libya no generations of people? The 99-year 
period mean three generations; that is to say, they passed 
judgement on all these three generations as being submissive and 
capitulationist, and accepting the American presence for at 
least 99 years, to be renewed for a further 99 years. [passage 
omitted] 
  When the Westerners heard a deputy, a minister, an 
ambassador, a prince, a counsellor, a king, or a head of 
government speaking they imagined that all the Libyan people 
were like him -- submissive and ready to sell out their homeland 
in order to fill their bellies, welcoming the Americans, the 
British, and the Italians, keeping Libya under the control of 
American bases for 99 years while the oil remained forever in 
the hand of the American companies. This shows that the 
Westerners are simpletons, unable to look ahead and incapable of 
genuine analysis. Otherwise the Westerners would have said 
that those people who are around us -- ministers, counsellors, 
and so on -- do not represent the Libyan people. [passage 
omitted] 
  These days we Libyans have felt that there was a greedy 
attempt being made against us by the Western states. This in 
fact has made us angry; we have taken to the streets and squares 
in challenge. We felt that 25 years after the revolution the 
West has forgotten what the revolution did and imagined that a 
country where a revolution has taken place is like any other 
country that has surrendered. The Arabs made the Western states 
and the Israelis entertain ambitions against them because they 
accepted a humiliating and shameful surrender -- a surrender 
which is shameful to the Arabs and their history. They 
unlimitedly, unreservedly, freely, and unjustifiably compromised 
the future and dignity of the Arab nation. The Arabs competed 
against each other to offer unconditional recognition to the 
Israelis. There was no need for that. We have hope that we 
will emerge from the confrontation victorious, and that we will 
deny the enemies their opportunity. Despite this revolution of 
anger by the Libyan people and the language of challenge, Libyan 
diplomacy and politics at all levels -- legal, political, 
economic, and intelligence, and so on -- are working day and 
night to win the battle at the levels of politics, diplomacy, 
economy, intelligence, and so on. 
  But we should not make excessive demands for a friendly 
solution and understanding because then winning will become 
worthless. If a triumph is achieved through being nice or being 
submissive, it will be of no value. I believe therefore that 
the Libyan people have actually felt that matters have reached 
such an point that we cannot continue in a friendly way as this 
will be useless and of no value, even if we win the case 
peacefully. We are taking a serious stance and showing that we 
do not always ask for peace, friendship, amity, and so on. No, 
this is not necessary. If you -- the West -- do not want 
friendship, then to hell with you; we will no longer regard 
ourselves as having good relations with you. Let the good 
relations go to hell. I have, brothers, said this in public 
speeches. It was not Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi who said it; it was 
God himself who said: Neither the Jews nor the Christians will 
be satisfied with you until you follow them. When they dictate 
to you and you carry out their orders they will be satisfied 
with you and accept you. They issue the orders and you will 
carry them out. This is what God himself said. See how 
conditional it is as God said: until you follow them. 
Otherwise, neither the Jews nor the Christians will be 
satisfied with you. The Jews and Christians today are the the 
Israelis and the Western states. [passage omitted] 
  The West is waging a civil war in the streets of Egypt. 
'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman who is waging a civil war in the streets 
of Egypt is with U.S. intelligence who are supplying him with 
money and...[pauses] Algeria -- the Algerian black hand is 
waging a war in Algeria -- this is common knowledge. It is the 
same black hand that tried to kill [as heard] Ahmed Ben Bella at 
the Ittihad hotel in Tripoli before...[pauses] during the days 
of the Algerian revolution. It is the same black hand that is 
now taking revenge on Algeria; that is, France is fighting 
Algeria now. 
  I want to tell you that when you hear leaders or anyone, 
even 
me, one day talking about friendship or such a thing, these 
friendly countries or... [pauses] No, we, as a people, should 
understand that this language could be a diplomatic one but in 
reality we never ever had any ambition that the Americans, the 
French, or the English could become friends of ours. They will 
remain our enemies until the Day of Judgement [applause] and if 
they find a weakness in us or an opening they will penetrate it. 
  You have seen the proof of that. Did they not go to Chad, 
contact Libyan POW's there, give them money, keep brainwashing 
them for several months, and subject them to all kinds of 
pressures until they persuaded them and took them away? Some of 
them came to their senses and returned from Nigeria, some 
returned from Zaire, and some came to their senses, escaped, and 
returned from the United States. There are some who still remain 
out of Libya. We do not know who is unable to return, who is 
under pressure, who is locked up, or who is being brainwashed. 
Look, who are the evildoers now? Has anyone gone to U.S. 
soldiers anywhere to bring them over to Libya? They are the 
ones who went to our sons in Chad and brought tension between us 
and Chad. Let us not get taken in or allow anyone to come and 
deceive us. 
  They say al-Qadhdhafi has got you into trouble with the 
United States and involved you in problems; why is he hostile to 
the United States? Are we hostile to the United States? Did we 
go to Vietnam to ask them to hand over to us the U.S. POW's whom 
they were holding so that we could take them over to Libya and 
train them against the United States? Or was it the Americans 
who went to Chad and asked the Chadians to give them the Libyans 
whom they were holding so that they could be mobilized against 
their country? It did not work, we found out. [crowd chants] 
  With America, the Western states, and the Israelis, it is 
not 
a question of seeking them in peace, in war, or in 
confrontation. No, they have very, very clear ambitions; you 
either accept their ambitions or you become their enemy, even if 
you turn the other cheek or keep quiet. See what they have been 
doing with us, and we have been keeping quiet. They have been 
pursuing us and seeking us out. They want to control the Arab 
homeland, destroy the revolution, destroy the unity of the Arab 
nation, and destroy Yemen's unity. They have to take the oil 
and control the regions where there is oil. They have to 
control the strategic regions. [two-minute break in reception] 
  When we asked about the story, they said that after the 
crash of their airliner over Britain, the Americans announced 
that anyone who would provide them with information on the crash 
would be given $1 million; that is, 300,000 Libyan dinars. 
Ju'akah [witness in Lockerbie case] told them: Give me the $1 
million and I will provide the information. They told him to go 
to them. He is a Libyan married to a Maltese woman and was 
living in Malta. He went to America. U.S. intelligence put him 
in jail and told him that he had to stay in jail until he 
testified before a court. 
  He asked for the $1 million. They replied: What $1 million? 
You are an important witness and have to stay in jail. He asked 
them: What will happen to me after the trial? They said: We 
cannot release you after the trial, because after the trial you 
might say that you were lying to us, that we enticed you, and 
that you had your eyes on the $1 million. You might change your 
testimony and create problems. 
  There was an interview between the Americans, Americans from 
U.S. intelligence, and some journalists. They were asked about 
Ju'akah's fate. They said that his fate was sealed. He will 
spend the rest of his life in a U.S. intelligence prison. 
  When the Libyans heard of this name, they started asking 
about Ju'akah's origins until they found out that he was from 
Suq al-Jum'ah in Tripoli. [passage omitted] Suq al-Jum'ah 
people met and found out in fact that there was a family named 
Ju'akah. I had met with these people in a large tent similar to 
this one. So the Ju'akah family was summoned and told by Suq 
al-Jum'ah people: your son told lies to the Americans. He told 
them that Libyans had caused the Lockerbie airplane crash. We 
are going to burn you, your house, and your plantation. The 
poor family said: We will kill our son when we find him. We 
disown him. The family went and brought his medical record, and 
said that he had been in a psychiatric hospital. [passage 
omitted] Then the Arabs of Zawiyat al-Mahjub started to 
investigate and they had meetings to see if the Ju'akah family 
were really from Zawiyat al-Mahjub; if this were so, they would 
have found the family members, homes, and farms. They had 
decided to burn them after pouring oil over them. They told me 
that there was an error and that Ju'akah was not from Zawiyat 
al-Mahjub. They said that he was from an area close to Ghmatah. 
When they hear the news in Ghmatah, they would start to look 
for them and if they found a family called Ju'akah to whom he 
belonged they would want to destroy and burn them and their 
home. This is tragic. It is tragic that serious things of this 
kind should take place. However, I, personally, cannot prevent 
that from happening. No one can prevent it because the masses 
are like a sea; if thousands of people storm a house of treason, 
they can storm, crush, burn and knock it down. [passage omitted] 
Despite the fact that these are dangerous things which might 
take place without anyone -- even the police -- being able to 
prevent them, when thousands of people march on a house, or a 
plantation, or a tribe, or families, they can tear them up into 
pieces without anyone being able to offer them protection. The 
reason is that the Libyan people cannot in fact bear this kind 
of thing. How, when we are in a state of confrontation against 
the enemy, could someone go to sell us? Some stray dog, a spy, 
an apostate, someone who is ready to sell his country for his 
interests, goes and sells us like a traitor. There are 
barricades between us and the Americans. We are on one side and 
they are on the other. How could you jump over barricades and 
go to the other side? 
  These are dangerous and very frightful things. Anyone who is 
considering treason, now thinks about it a thousand times, and 
even if he manages to flee, and offers himself in sacrifice, he 
knows that his family, his home, his plantation, and all his 
property will be destroyed, burned, and walked over by the 
masses. The angry masses might march over them and destroy them. 
[applause] 
  The fact is that treason is no longer an easy thing. This 
is the positive thing. The Libyan people set up this practice 
and made a decision, not through the legal system -- judges, 
prosecution, and courts. The Libyan people made a decision and 
set a rule which consists in attacking treason, putting it under 
siege and attacking it with a view to destroying it. The target 
would not be the person only, but his family too. [passage 
omitted] 
  In fact these are all dangerous threats which originate from 
the masses against whoever thinks of treason. Now, as long as 
this is a basis rule that has been established by the Libyan 
people and a decision that has been taken by the Libyan people, 
everyone should take these threats seriously. Everyone should 
please pay attention to his family, his kids, his relatives, and 
himself. You would not only be taken to the public prosecution 
and to court and get capital punishment, a life sentence or 
other punishment for being a traitor or a spy; you should also 
think of the family, the traitor's family, and home which have 
become endangered. [passage omitted] 
  Yes, these threats have become dangerous. Please, everyone 
who is present here should inform those who are not. No one 
could prevent the masses' revenge. By God, we can no longer 
guarantee the safety of the family, relatives, or possessions of 
traitors. People are right; that is, if a traitor's family comes 
from a given tribe, then the tribe would disavow them so that 
treason could be contained in that family. The tribe would 
destroy them, and tell them: You have dishonored us. [passage 
omitted] 
  There are other things which are no less serious than going 
over to the United States and selling oneself. It is all 
treason; you will see. Considering that so far the battle has 
not been a battle of guns, missiles, aircraft or similar things. 
The battle has begun, but it is a cold war. I wish it were a 
heated battle. Perhaps with rifles and machine guns, the 
Americans would not be at peace and would feel unsettled, and 
finally withdraw as they are doing now from Somalia. 
  The threat is that in a cold war the enemy might win without 
your noticing it. The enemy might occupy your home, your 
street, your mind, your stomach, your farm, and your shop 
without your being aware of it. How? Trading in dollars 
constitutes treason, pushing down the value of the Libyan dinar 
constitutes treason, smuggling out Libyan products constitutes 
treason, smuggling out medicines constitutes treason, smuggling 
out food constitutes treason, smuggling out fuel and petrol 
abroad constitutes treason. By God, brothers even going for 
treatment abroad, tourism and spending money in Switzerland... 
[pauses] you have heard from your radio what Switzerland has 
said. It has said that it will implement the sanctions against 
Libya. You should keep quiet at least, Switzerland, because 
Libyans always say: Switzerland, Switzerland, Switzerland. 
Those who need medical treatment want to go to Switzerland and 
millions have been spent in Switzerland. Listen to what 
Switzerland has been saying. It has not said that it was 
benefiting from Libyans -- from whom it has taken millions -- 
but it has said that it wants to implement sanctions against 
them and freeze Libyan assets if found. Did you or did you not 
hear about this? [passage omitted] 
  Those who have been playing havoc in the country through 
nepotism and corruption are traitors. But who is doing this? 
Is there a solution for this? Any solution will come from you. 
Those things are being carried out by you; and it is up to you 
as free men. [crowd chants] If I were the one doing these things 
I would stop straight away here in front of you, but it is not 
me. They are being carried out by members of the public, by 
free citizens. It is, thus, up to you to stop anyone who is 
caught smuggling anything, like that one who was caught at the 
harbor trying to smuggle medicine to Syria. [passage omitted] 
  Treachery is not merely those spies, who. we caught the day 
before yesterday, or those stray dogs. Your children, who have 
joined the Muslim Brotherhood, are also traitors; those of them, 
who have joined heretics, are also traitors. 
  Those calamities which are called Atonement and Flight, the 
Call, al-Jihad, the Party of Liberation, and the Muslim 
Brotherhood -- did they exist during the era of the prophet or 
during the era of 'Umar? Did they exist when were fighting the 
Italians? If they did exist we did not know about them. Even 
of they had existed no one would have followed them because 
hundreds of denominations have always existed. [crowd chants] 
[passage omitted, including one-minute break in reception] 
  The spies whom you have caught were found to be responsible 
for many rumors which we have been hearing on the street. This 
was done on the orders of U.S. intelligence; rumors which were 
hatched by U.S. intelligence, taught to them [the spies] who 
were then asked to spread them in the Libyan streets to 
undermine the Libyan people's morale, make the Libyan people 
doubt their revolution, their ability to revolt, and their 
capabilities, so that the Libyan people would weaken before 
America, Britain, and France, hand over their sons, accept to be 
ranked among the agents and those who have surrendered, and 
again surrender their oil and their land to the enemies. 
  The rumors that we used to hear; they [the spies] have now 
admitted that they were spreading these rumors at the 
instigation of U.S. intelligence. They say: They told us to 
spread a rumor against so and so; distort this and distort that; 
do this and do that. This is known to us; it is not strange to 
us. 
  When rumors emerge, we know that there is a black hand and 
foreign intelligence is behind them. However, we are not so 
stupid as to repeat them. What, repeat them and destroy our 
homes and dig our own graves? This is what would hurt and mean 
that we are stupid people. America wants us to repeat rumors. 
America has hatched and spread them in our streets. 
  The hashish you hear about -- this is on the orders of the 
Western states. Israel runs narcotics farms. Hashish is 
planted in Palestine and directed against the Arab countries. 
The Israelis have said: If there is no war of missiles, let us 
have a hashish war. We cannot accept the existence of an Arab 
nation; Israel has to extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the 
Gulf, not from the Euphrates to the Nile. The Jewish state must 
extend to North Africa and include the whole of Syria. 
  Brothers, the drugs, the hashish, come in sealed boxes and 
organized containers under the seals of a state. These are 
missiles and bombs which they drop on Arab shores from Morocco 
to Egypt to Syria. The farms are in Palestine. It is strange. 
This should have been said a long time ago; at least people 
should have known about it. They talk about hashish as if it 
has come down from the sky. Do they not know that it is a plant 
that grows in Palestine? Who grows it? The Jews grow it. Why? 
So that they can destroy the Arab nation. It is clear. 
  America is fighting in Latin America; the United States 
invaded Panama because of hashish. So why don't you invade 
Palestine and the Israelis, and destroy the hashish farms? No, 
because the West is in agreement with the Israelis; the hashish 
farms in Palestine are weapons against the Arabs. No one can 
touch those farms. [The West tells the] Israelis, grow hashish 
and distribute it in Arab countries and we will pay you. 
America is paying a billion [currency not specified] just for 
them to plant hashish and send it to Libya and Morocco. 
[passage omitted] 
  If you take a box of hashish from Libya and leave it on U.S. 
shores, and if they know it is from Libya, they will hit you 
with missiles. We are submissive; bring in hashish, distribute 
hashish, trade in hashish, taste hashish and get used to 
hashish. [passage omitted] 
  The Americans, the English, and the French have been hit 
hard. They changed their tune when they saw a sea of Libyan 
masses with al-Qadhdhafi. They said: We used to think that 
al-Qadhdhafi did not have people supporting him and his people 
were ready to surrender. [crowd chants slogans] This is what 
has deterred and frightened them and made them change their tune 
recently. By God, their tune has changed, brothers. The Arab 
rulers began to contact me and said: Please calm the situation 
down a little bit. They were frightened. Each one got in touch 
with me. Some contacted President Husni Mubarak and said to 
him: Your relations with al- Qadhdhafi are good. Please tell 
him to calm the situation down a little. What is this 
revolution he started in Libya? This revolution is motivating 
the masses against us. Please, Mu'ammar, calm down a little. 
[applause, chanting] Yesterday a delegation from Egypt came to 
see me. The delegation said that the reception given to me in 
Banghazi was intimidating. [Al-Qadhdhafi laughs; applause]

<F P=106> [Interview with Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the </F>
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), by 
Riyad Mansur in Amman; date not given] 
  [Text] [Mansur] The al-Asad-Clinton summit has clarified 
the situation and it may push the peace process forward. As a 
leader of the Palestinian opposition, how do you view the summit? 
  [Hawatimah] The Geneva summit has once again emphasized that 
U.S. Middle East policy still operates on a double standard. 
The U.S. President announced that he was for a comprehensive 
and just solution in accordance with the resolutions of 
international legitimacy. But when it comes to the tangible 
agenda, we immediately notice the use of double standards. The 
U.S. Administration is ready to do that on the Golan front, 
Lebanon, and the occupied Jordanian territories. The same also 
applies to the occupied Palestinian territories. 
  This was clear in the Geneva summit talks, and was also 
tackled during the al-Asad-Clinton news conference. Clinton 
stressed his administrations' commitment to international 
legitimacy and the principle of land for peace regarding the 
Golan, southern Lebanon, and Jordanian territories, but he 
adopted the Oslo accord, which conflicts with the resolutions of 
international legitimacy. Replying to questions on settlement in 
the occupied territories, he said that these territories were 
disputed areas, in conflict with Resolutions 242 and 338 and 
with other Security Council resolutions. 
  This double standard was also clear when he replied to a 
question on implementing Security Council resolutions on Iraq, 
while Israel ignored Resolutions 242 and 338. He used two 
standards--the standard of the heavy club and comprehensive 
destruction for Iraq and the standard of bypassing everything 
that might embarrass Israel. At the same time, he left the door 
open for the settlement process, which was condemned by Security 
Council resolutions as illegitimate and illegal, in addition to 
turning the Palestinian territories into disputed areas. 
  The Syrian side adhered to a comprehensive withdrawal in 
return for peace and to the unity of all the tracks in the peace 
process, because all the occupied territories are Arab and are 
subject to international resolutions. This shows the big 
mistake 'Arafat made when he moved from secret talks in 
Washington to secret talks in Oslo, struck a partial agreement, 
and accepted all the Israeli peace conditions without regaining 
an inch of land. He approved the Oslo accord and recognized 
Israel's right to exist in accordance with Rabin's conditions, 
as well as normalization and security and economic cooperation, 
without getting anything in return. This conflicts with the 
principle of land for peace. 
  This reveals the extent of the crime committed by the Oslo 
team when it accepted all the Israeli conditions. Thus, the 
Palestinian territories became, as Clinton and Israel put it, a 
disputed area in violation of the principle of land for peace. 
Regarding the Gaza-Jericho agreement, pressure is being 
exercised in the Taba talks regarding secondary issues like the 
crossing points, the redeployment of the occupation forces, and 
the areas that will not be controlled by the Israeli forces, as 
well as the alternative Palestinian conditions. All these 
secondary issues will fall, and insistence on the principle of 
land for peace will survive. This necessarily requires the 
cancellation of the Oslo accord and the return to the peace 
negotiations based on international legitimacy and halting the 
settlement process. Israel is drawing up plans to make a 
complete geographic and demographic change in Arab East 
Jerusalem in two years, after which no Arab East Jerusalem land 
will be left for negotiations. In addition, the settlement 
process is going on in the West Bank and Gaza. Therefore, we 
have warned against falling into the trap of recognition, 
normalization, and security and economic cooperation, which are 
Israel's peace terms, without securing withdrawal from occupied 
Palestinian territories in accordance with Resolution 242 and 
other Security Council resolutions and without solving the issue 
of the refugees in accordance with UN Resolution 194. 
  [Mansur] Nothing has yet been implemented from the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. Will there be an Israeli withdrawal, or 
will things remain the way they are? 
  [Hawatimah] Even 'Arafat himself could not drink the poison 
of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and is trying to escape from it, 
using superficial issues. We therefore call for that agreement 
to be annulled; for a return to the home of national unity, 
which is the strongest weapon in our hands against occupation 
and settlement; and for the negotiating equation to be rebuilt 
on the basis of the land-for-peace formula, which is the 
complete opposite of the Oslo formula. 
  After the Geneva summit, the Israeli Government is playing 
two very serious games, and we warn against them. First, the 
Israeli Government's statement on declaring Syrian sovereignty 
over the Golan Heights in return for a clear Syrian statement on 
readiness to accept normalization, the exchange of diplomatic 
and commercial ties, and the opening of borders. We remind 
everyone of the success Israel achieved by pushing 'Arafat to 
such a statement. Israel has managed to get all Israeli 
conditions without relinquishing an inch of land. We also 
remind everyone of the example of southern Lebanon. Since 1978, 
Israel been making statements about Lebanese political 
sovereignty over south Lebanon, saying that it does not covet a 
single inch. However, Israeli occupation has continued since 
then. 
  Declaring Syria's political sovereignty over the Golan 
Heights is similar to the Israeli declarations on Lebanese 
sovereignty over south Lebanon. Israel must recognize the 
principle of withdrawal and then set a timetable for that 
withdrawal. 
  The example of south Lebanon is flagrant. For 15 years, 
Israel has been declaring that Lebanon has political sovereignty 
over south Lebanon -- that is probably why it set up the South 
Lebanon Army. Israel has also been stating that it does not 
covet a single inch of Lebanese territory or a drop of Lebanese 
water. However, it has been more than 15 years and we have 
still not seen Israel withdraw its occupation troops from a 
single inch of south Lebanon in compliance with Resolution 425. 
  Therefore, the Arab states should learn from the south 
Lebanon experience and from the deep abyss into which the 
advocates of the Olso agreement have fallen. The Arab states 
should not fall in the trap of a declaration of political 
sovereignty over their territory in exchange for normalization 
and ties because this means accepting the Israeli conditions 
without withdrawal from a single inch of the occupied Arab 
territories. South Lebanon is an example. They should also 
not fall in the Oslo agreement abyss -- to accept normalization 
in return for farfetched illusions. 
  We also warn the Arab states against attempts to deal with 
the Oslo team. The Tunis team is now trying to involve itself 
again in the Washington talks. Washington is now pressing to 
promote the Tunis team and the agreement on the separate 
Gaza-Jericho agreement by inviting that team to Washington 
despite the fact that it has no work there. This team already 
has an agenda for negotiations over proposals for choosing a 
self-rule administrative council. The real objective for that 
team's trip to Washington is to provide a cover for the Oslo 
agreement, which is now drowning, and to give it an umbrella by 
the cordon states. 
  Israel's second dangerous game is its threat to put the 
question of withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights, south 
Lebanon, and Jordanian territory to a referendum. These are 
occupied territories that should be vacated as provided for by 
UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Under a referendum, 
the Israeli public opinion would be in a position to override UN 
resolutions. The principle of referendum lends the Golan 
Heights, south Lebanon, and Jordanian territory the status of 
disputed rather than occupied land, the future of which would be 
a matter for the Israeli public opinion. The Israelis are thus 
extending the crime committed by the Oslo agreement to other 
Arab fronts. The Oslo agreement has, virtually, turned the 
occupied Palestinian land into disputed territory. This is 
because the agreement satisfies Israel's peace terms even before 
it ceded a single inch of land or acceded to the principle of a 
pullout from the occupied Palestinian territory as envisaged by 
UN resolutions. 
  [Mansur] The Israeli Government has hinted that unless 
'Arafat accedes to Israel's terms, it will quicken the pace of 
the talks with Syria. What do you think? 
  [Hawatimah] This is not the first time that Israel has 
sought to use intra-Arab contradictions to its advantage and 
capitalize on parochial and isolationist attitudes in the Arab 
arena. The idea is to promote its occupation of Arab land. 
Israel has applied the same tactic since the sixth round of the 
bilateral Washington talks. In August, 1992, the Israelis 
created the impression that the road was clear for progress on 
other tracks by way of getting the Palestinian leadership in 
Tunis to run after secret talks in Oslo behind the backs of 
'Arafat's negotiating team in Washington. Let's remember that 
the Washington negotiators were mostly unwilling to make the 
kind of astonishing concessions 'Arafat was pressing Haydar 
'Abd-al-Shafi to make. Throughout the negotiating exercise in 
Madrid, Washington, and Oslo the Palestinian and other Arab 
peoples were kept in the dark. What took place in Oslo were 
secret negotiations held behind the backs of the Washington team 
and Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, who began to balk at the considerable 
amount of concessions the Tunis leadership wanted him to make. 
  The Arab parties must beware of these Israeli tactics. 
Otherwise, they will fall one after another and be made to go 
along with Israel's terms for a settlement, without any of the 
UN resolutions stipulating an Israeli pullout from the occupied 
Palestinian territory being honored. 
  [Mansur] Some say that the U.S.-Syrian Geneva summit will 
lead to a peace agreement between Syria and Israel. As a leader 
of the Palestinian opposition, how much room will you have to 
operate on Syrian territory? 
  [Hawatimah] Whether Syria reaches an agreement or not, this 
is Syria's business. We hope that narrow regional interests and 
views will not take precedence over the common national and 
pan-Arab interests of our people to struggle to end the 
occupation, dismantle the settlements, exchange land for peace, 
and implement the resolutions of international legitimacy. Such 
befuddling arguments have been going on for years. They will 
continue after the Geneva summit. 
  Those who try to depict the situation as if the Palestinian 
movement depends on administrative offices in the Arab capitals 
are under a great illusion. Whether these administrative 
facilities remain or go, this will not affect the genuine 
Palestinian democratic forces that call for a balanced and 
comprehensive peace on the basis of full withdrawal in return 
for full peace. Actually, some of these facilities are no 
longer provided. For us in the DFLP, this is a very minor 
issue. We exist within the organizational, popular, political, 
professional, and armed ranks of our people inside the occupied 
Palestinian territory and in the diaspora. Our offices exist 
inside the hearts of the people, their homes, and in several 
social, trade, and professional institutions in the occupied 
territories, which have been in existence for over 25 years. 
Our people's camps in the diaspora are the arenas in which our 
organizations operate. Also, the homes in the camps are our 
offices. It is useful to have administrative facilities in the 
Arab capitals. However, should some constraints be imposed on 
us, this will not affect us. This is a minor issue, because the 
democratic and nationalist forces of opposition exist in the 
occupied territories, the camps, and the diaspora, and not in 
administrative offices in this or that capital. 
  [Mansur] Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi is now leading an 
opposition movement for democratic reforms in the PLO. What can 
you tell him? 
  [Hawatimah] I have said, and I say again, that we welcome 
the person who discovered 'Arafat's dictatorship 26 months late. 
We tell him that if he really wants to democratize PLO 
institutions, make collective decisions, and reestablish 
Palestinian national unity, then he should join the democratic 
and nationalist opposition, spearheaded by the DFLP. Now, we 
have a unified central command for the 10 factions. We will 
operate by having reference to popular legitimacy at conferences 
at home and abroad and by electing leaders from the base to the 
top by democratic means. 
  I tell Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi that his major mistake was that 
after the eighth round of the peace talks, he did not declare a 
halt to the bilateral talks and boycott the multilateral talks. 
'Abd-al-Shafi made another mistake when he traveled to Tunis. 
He came back sad and disappointed. He said that he was sure 
this time that the decision was in the hands of one person. 
Therefore, he can now return to the people and the masses, 
along with us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Taysir Khalid, member of the PLO Executive </F>
Committee and of the Political Bureau of the Democratic Front 
for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), by 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Khatib--place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Al-Khatib] Why did you consider the summit 
between the Syrian and U.S. presidents in Geneva positive? 
  [Khalid] The summit itself is an important event. It 
reaffirms Syria's role in achieving a political settlement after 
the U.S. Administration tried to marginalize this role, 
especially after the signing of the Oslo agreement, and tried to 
show that a settlement could be conducted according to U.S. 
plans. 
  The events reaffirmed Syria's importance in conducting a 
political settlement. Moreover, the summit affirmed basic 
principles since the aim is to achieve a comprehensive 
settlement. The U.S. Administration reiterated, through Clinton, 
its commitment to a comprehensive peace based on Resolutions 242 
and 338, which stipulate Israel's withdrawal from all the Arab 
territories occupied since 1967, and on Resolution 425, which 
stipulates Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon, as well as 
the land-for-peace principle. These bases were violated when 
the Oslo agreement was signed and through the statements 
delivered at the signing ceremony. Therefore, we considered the 
reaffirmation of these bases as something important. 
  Despite the positive aspect of this summit, we, as a 
democratic front, were hoping that the Syrian side would address 
the Palestinian dimension of the conflict and of its solution. 
We were also hoping that a solution would be based on the 
national legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. This was 
absent during the Syrian-U.S. summit. 
  [Al-Khatib] Some say that you adopted this stand in 
accordance with the political, geographical, and leadership 
stand in Syria. How do you respond to this, especially since the 
issue of the 10 opposition factions was on the agenda of the 
summit between the two presidents? 
  [Khalid] We are always asked these questions and we have 
responded to them in the past. Our policy, as a democratic 
front, is not governed by the factor of geographic location in 
this country or that. Our standard is to adhere to the higher 
national interest of the Palestinian people. The DFLP has never 
submitted to anyone. We were often involved in political and 
non-political differences with some Arab countries, especially 
Syria, concerning Palestinian decisionmaking. This was in the 
1970s and 1980s, particularly when there was a rift in the PLO 
ranks and we were centered in Damascus. At the time, we did not 
consider the geographic dimension in making our decisions, but 
we basically considered the interest of the Palestinian people 
and we frankly announced our stand toward the Syrian policy. 
  In any case, the summit is not a magic key for a political 
settlement. This summit reaffirmed bases which could be a key 
toward progress on the various negotiating tracks, including the 
Syrian-Israeli track. The Israeli statements after the summit 
confirm that negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track are not 
easy, not to mention that the Israeli lobby in the United States 
is exercising pressure to diminish the weight of U.S. 
affirmations expressed by President Clinton. Therefore, we say 
that fears about how this summit will affect Syria's relations 
with the Syrian-based opposition forces are highly exaggerated. 
We are not at all worried about this summit and its results. 
  [Al-Khatib] What are the requisites for achieving progress 
on the Syrian-Israeli track with relation to the Palestinian 
opposition forces? And why don't you practice your opposition 
from within the future Palestinian authority? 
  [Khalid] Our experience with Syria is long. We and our 
Syrian brothers learned lessons from this experience. In the 
past, Syria closed down the DFLP offices between 1983 and 1988 
on the day leader Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir] was martyred. 
Despite this, the DFLP remained unshaken and did not retreat. 
The closing of its offices did not affect its weight among the 
ranks of our Palestinian people. On the contrary, the DFLP's 
effectiveness and respect increased among our Palestinian people. 
  We in the DFLP will continue to be an independent force that 
does not submit to anyone. Even if we assume that Syria is 
doing what you are assuming, we are convinced that this will not 
affect our stand, role, and weight. This also applies to our 
comrades in the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
and the Hamas movement. Whoever has an entrenched and deep 
rooted presence within the ranks of his people does not take 
such calculations into account. 
  As for the second part of your question, we will not take 
part in elections for the future self-rule agencies because the 
agencies that will emanate from these elections will have only 
one mission; that is, political responsibility toward the 
agreement reached in Oslo. The Oslo agreement is receiving 
opposition because it closed the doors to our people's right to 
return, to self-determination, and to establishing an 
independent state. Moreover, this agreement only seeks to turn 
the occupied territories into protected areas under Israeli 
control. However, we will definitely wage our political battles 
with those who signed this agreement. We will do so through 
wide participation in all the self-rule authorities that are of 
a popular nature, such as student, cultural, and professional 
unions as well as chambers of commerce, municipal and village 
councils, and clubs. We will go through with these elections in 
order to create a state of double authority between the 
administrative self-rule agencies and institutions and bodies 
that emerge from elections that have nothing to do with 
implementing the Oslo agreement. We will continue our struggle 
on the ground to prevent actual implementation of this agreement. 
  [Al-Khalid] What do you think about the PLO's recent call to 
restore dialogue and coordination with Syria after the Geneva 
summit? 
  [Khalid] The PLO leadership behaved unilaterally when it 
held 
secret negotiations in Oslo behind the backs of the Palestinian 
people, of their legitimate institutions and national factions, 
and of the Arab parties to the negotiations. In practice, the 
Oslo agreement was a form of separate political settlement. 
This leadership is responsible for the Arab reactions, for 
striking at Arab coordination, and for holding secret 
negotiations. As for now, we do not know on which common 
denominators coordination can be held. We call for canceling 
the Oslo agreement and returning to national constants. If this 
happens, then it is natural to call on the Arab countries, 
especially Syria, to return to coordination with the Palestinian 
side in order to reach a comprehensive solution on all fronts.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Israel and Post-Geneva Tricks"] </F>
  [Text] Yitzhaq Rabin's government is trying to exploit 
Arab contradiction and the lack of coordination among the Arab 
parties participating in the peace process. One time it says it 
is going to give precedence to the Syrian track over the other 
tracks, and other times it says it is going to focus on making 
the self-rule negotiations in Taba a success because it cannot 
divide its interests and make concessions on two tracks all at 
once. 
  While Rabin announced Israel's agreement to the "principle" 
of withdrawing from the Arab Syrian Golan Heights, Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres warned the Palestinians that Israel may 
give precedence to its negotiations with Syria over the 
negotiations with the PLO. He said: "We have several options, 
and we can change direction by moving from the Palestinian track 
to the Syrian track, whereas the Palestinians have no other 
option." 
  These Israeli threats would not have been made had it not 
been for the present regrettable estrangement between the Syrian 
and Palestinian sides since the announcement of the signing of 
the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. 
  Just as the Israeli Government is trying to exploit the 
Palestinian side's weakness, it is also using the same maneuvers 
with the Syrian side and trying to undermine the successful 
summit meeting held in Geneva last Sunday between Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. 
  The Israeli response to the Syrian commitment to peace and 
to 
all its results--like exchanging ambassadors and trade relations 
and opening borders in return for Israel's withdrawal from all 
the occupied Arab territories--was suspicious and cautious. It 
is represented in the prime minister's statement about 
conducting a referendum before agreeing to withdraw from the 
Golan Heights. 
  Proposing the referendum idea is part of the old Israeli 
tactic designed to thwart any Arab peace plan. Rabin's 
government knows well that the Syrian president has put the ball 
in its court, as attested by the leader of the sole superpower 
in the world, the United States. It is trying to get out of 
this dilemma by looking for ways out that enable it to play for 
time and to obstruct the driving force resulting from the Geneva 
meeting, hence it has come out with the referendum idea. Thus 
all that is being said in Israeli circles about disagreements 
over this question is merely a kind of throwing dust in the eyes. 
  So all these Israeli maneuvers should not fool the Arabs, 
especially the Palestinians and the Syrians. Because it is 
untrue that they have no other options as Rabin and Peres say. 
On the contrary, the Arabs of the occupied territories and the 
men of the Islamic national resistance in southern Lebanon are 
daily carrying out the most important option through their 
daring operations against the occupation. 
  What is required is to restore organized coordination among 
the Arab parties participating in the peace process as soon as 
possible in order to close any gap through which the Israeli may 
infiltrate to sabotage the peace process and exploit Arab 
contradictions and differences.

<F P=106> ["Remark" column by Hasan al-Kashif: "The Golan and the </F>
Referendum"] 
  [Text] The Clinton-al-Asad agreement on the Golan has 
raised an open and hot debate in Israel, not in Syria. In his 
reply to the settlers' opposition to the principle of withdrawal 
from the Golan and the possibility of dismantling and evacuating 
the settlements there, Rabin proposed a general referendum to 
decide on the dispute over the future of the Golan. 
  Clinton's promises and pledges to maintain Israel's military 
edge over the Arabs are not enough. All the guarantees and 
concessions that Hafiz al-Asad offers are not enough. Because 
the Jew, who has become an Israeli, does not look at his huge 
gains in land, security, and superiority, but raises media and 
political battles concerning the tiny issue of the land of 
others that he will relinquish after imposing too many 
conditions. 
  The settlers do not feel secure about the future despite the 
U.S. proposals for deploying U.S. forces in a buffer zone in the 
Golan, in which U.S. military bases will shoulder the tasks of 
warning and security that are shouldered by the settlements at 
present. 
  To the Jew, who is skilled in blackmail, the U.S. presence 
in 
the Golan is a gain for Washington, and Israeli military power, 
which was created through U.S. support, is also a gain to 
Washington and its Middle East policy. Therefore, the U.S. 
policy of giving orders that will be applied by Arab rulers 
engaged in the settlement does not suit the rulers in Tel Aviv 
or the Israeli settlers. 
  According to U.S. plans for establishing a U.S. peace in the 
Middle East through Israeli-Arab agreements and through 
subjecting the rule of the Arab agents to the security, 
military, and economic needs of Washington, the Arab rulers 
should apply the U.S. orders. 
  We have not heard from a ruler participating in the 
settlement any promise to conduct a referendum on reconciliation 
with Tel Aviv, on establishing normal relations with it and on 
relinquishing most of the land of Palestine and some nearby Arab 
territories. 
  While we hear the enemy, which the colonialist West set up, 
speak about referendums on the fate of a land that does not 
belong to it, we do not hear Hafiz al-Asad asking the people of 
Syria about their opinion. This is because he knows well the 
Syrian people's opinion of their enemy, which is occupying some 
of their land and the whole of Palestine. Al-Asad also knows 
the opinion of the Syrian people on his regime, his personality, 
as well as his pan-Arab, international, and internal policies. 
  The strangest thing is that Hafiz al-Asad is opposed to the 
idea of a referendum, about which Rabin spoke to his settlers. 
This is because to al-Asad, the subject is really about 
agreements between presidents, with which the Syrian people have 
nothing to do, despite the fact that the Syrian people are the 
owners of the land. By this premise, why should the Israelis 
have an opinion on this subject? 
  This time we agree with Hafiz al-Asad's viewpoint. It is 
true that the Syrian people have nothing to do with al-Asad's 
agreements with Washington and Tel Aviv, because the Syrian 
people are innocent of these agreements and of al-Asad's signing 
of these agreements.

the Culture and Information Ministry: "Beware of the Patient 
Man's Rage"] 
  [Text] The UN Security Council issued a routine statement 
on 18 January in which it renewed the unjust blockade for 60 
days. As in the previous statements, the majority of the 
Security Council could not justify the continuation of the 
blockade. 
  This time, however, the ambassadors of some member states of 
the Security Council expressed strong protests. The Chinese 
ambassador called strongly for the lifting the blockade, while 
the ambassadors of Spain, Brazil, and Nigeria reiterated this 
stand. The French ambassador, as well as the British 
ambassador, noted the positive stands adopted by Iraq. Despite 
this, the Security Council issued a statement, without 
introducing any amendments, because of the U.S. ambassador's 
insistence on this. The U.S. ambassador expressed her 
government's concern over the security of Iraq's neighbors. 
  We, in Iraq, realize that the blockade no longer has any 
justification, and our friends realize this, as well. Now, the 
camp of the enemies has begun to collapse and some of its 
members have become aware of the dangerous political game played 
by the managers of U.S. interests and their agents in the 
region, who are besieging Iraq at the expense of their people 
and at the expense of the interests of other nations and 
countries. 
  We also are aware that the Americans want us to guarantee 
the 
security of the bandits, the rulers of the Kuwait governorate 
and Saudi Arabia. They want us to relinquish the rights of our 
people and nation in Palestine, imagining that the wisdom and 
necessity of implementing the Security Council resolutions -- 
despite their injustice -- will make Iraq accept whatever it is 
asked for. 
  The Iraqis will not say more than what leader Saddam Husayn 
said on the third anniversary of the aggression: They will not 
turn wisdom into a prelude for weakness and despair. The Iraqis 
will not remain silent at the continuation of the blockade and 
the violation of Iraqi airspace. We will never abandon our 
people in northern Iraq. If we become certain -- despite our 
patience and the good offices exerted by our friends to end the 
abnormal situation resulting from the blockade and the 
violations of Iraqi sovereignty in the north and south -- we are 
capable of bringing the game back to the beginning. [sentence 
as published] We are the original people in this region and we 
are the ones who own everything on our land. We will not allow 
the agents, lowly people, or coveters to encroach on what we 
own, on our rights, and on our dignity. As the leader said, the 
punishment of the criminals will be an eye for an eye and a 
tooth for a tooth. The Arabs say: "Beware of the patient man's 
rage."

<F P=106> [Editorial by Abu-Sirhan: "The Gap"] </F>
  [Text] Two events attracted the attention of the Iraqis 
over the past two weeks. The people expressed pride in these 
two events and talked about them in their private discussions. 
The first of these events is the leader president's meeting 
with the Armed Forces command members and his explanation of 
events in the Mother of Battles, and the second is his 
excellency's speech on the third anniversary of the great 
confrontation. 
  After the speech was carried on the TV screen the evening of 
16 January, the dollar prices rose to 160 dinars [D]. The 
dollar prices continued to rise against the dinar over the past 
two days, reaching D169 at 1400 on 19 January, and up to D171 by 
the end of that day. 
  This shows that our enemy, which has not been able to wrench 
anything from us and failed to realize a clear military victory 
or a historical triumph, as the leader president said, has made 
some gains in the arena of the economic battle. Therefore, we 
have retreated a step. This shows that there is always a gap 
between the leader and his way of thinking on the one hand and 
the implementing tools on the other. The following facts 
explain this: 
  When the new cabinet took office and made a number of 
decisions, the dollar price jumped from D68 to D80. Later, the 
dollar jumped to D150, dropped to D130, and continued to range 
between D130 and D135. Now it stands at D171. The real danger 
is that while in the past decisions reflected various aspects, 
they now reflect only the political aspect in isolation from 
other aspects because our departments commit mistakes in dealing 
with the blockade and the continuous pressure from abroad. 
Political decisions now are associated with economic facts that 
are not in harmony with them. They do not go hand in hand to 
realize their target. This prompts us to deal with this issue 
seriously, with extreme precision, and with an academic 
intelligence [dhaka' akadimi] coupled with the actual 
conditions. Why? 
  The UN Security Council statements say: "Two months have 
elapsed since the Security Council issued its resolution on 
long-term monitoring of Iraq. Twelve months must pass in order 
to ascertain Iraq's goodwill and be able to discuss or lift the 
embargo." 
  The statements of the French have become so ugly, exactly 
like their treatment of strangers in their land. Their 
statements are like their behavior and the behavior of their 
president, Mitterrand the supercilious, who is completely 
connected with the morals and behavior of those who ruled the 
Fourth Republic. 
  Let us consider the following: In the past, when the dollar 
was exchanged for D30, we made our observations in a newspaper 
column. When it reached D60, we held a discussion, which did 
not last more than 15 minutes, to express observations and point 
out the negative aspects of the rising dollar prices. When the 
dollar price exceeded D100, we held a one and a half hour 
discussion to make some observations. If we want to discuss the 
current conditions, we will have to spend no less than two or 
three hours in order to propose solutions. This means that those 
who are responsible for implementing decisions do not benefit 
from these observations. Their work is confused. This is proved 
by the fact that after every meeting of the ministerial 
committee charged with the economic conditions, the dinar slumps 
further and further. 
  Therefore, we suggest that each ministerial portfolio be 
dealt with in accordance with its achievements. And this is 
directly connected with the dinar and dollar prices, because 
this issue is casting a dark shadow and is affecting the daily 
life of the citizen. Therefore, the following yardstick should 
be the slogan: A rise in the dollar price means failure and a 
drop means success. 
  The proof that there is a difference between the source of 
the decisions, which is the comrade leader, and the mode of 
thinking of the implementers is that his treatment of the rise 
in the dollar was quick and had a clear effect on the life of 
the citizen; namely, increasing the citizens provisions. This 
method is much better than economic measures that could have 
been taken and whose results would only appear in the long run 
without the citizen feeling them because of the rise in the 
dollar exchange rate.

  [Text] New York, 25 Jan (INA) -- Iraq has protested to the 
United Nations against the U.S. U-2 spy plane's violation of its 
airspace under the pretext of conducting aerial surveys for the 
UN Special Commission. 
  In a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
yesterday, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said that 
on 3, 17, 18, and 19 of January, this plane overflew large areas 
of Iraq and then headed back for its base in Saudi Arabia. 
  The letter reiterated Iraq's belief that this plane is being 
used for purposes other than those specified by the Security 
Council and that its activity prejudices Iraq's security and 
sovereignty.

  [Text] Violence broke out again in south Lebanon at 1630 
today when Israeli forces directed a concentrated, fierce 
bombardment against villages and towns in the south. Our 
correspondent 'Ali Dawud has the details. 
  [Begin Dawud recording] The occupation forces have stirred 
up 
the security situation and increased their attacks. The 
occupation forces artillery shelled numerous villages in 
al-Nabatiyah and the central sector in the morning and in the 
afternoon. The shelling of al-Tamiriyah killed one citizen and 
inflicted extensive damage to houses and property. 
  The occupation forces escalated their attacks and artillery 
fire against southern villages at 1600 today. Shells fell in 
Zawtar al- Gharbiyah, Zawtar al-Sharqiyah, Qa'qa'iyat al-Jisr, 
Frun, and al- Ghanduriyah towns and on the suburbs of Kafr 
Rumman, Tulin, Majdal Silm, al-Sawwanah, Qabrikha, al-Tamiriyah, 
and Safad al-Battikh. These areas came under bombardment from 
various large-caliber and long-range guns and scores of shells 
landed on them this evening. 
  The fierce shelling coincided with helicopter flights over 
the al-Litani River basin. It was continuing at 1715. 
  Before noon today, the occupation forces' artillery 
stationed 
in al-Shumariyah and al-Zaffatah shelled the outskirts of Zawtar 
al- Gharbiyah and Zawtar al-Sharqiyah towns and al-Litani River 
basin. Shelling in the morning and the afternoon covered Majdal 
Silm, al- Sawwanah, Qabrikha, Wadi al-Hujayr, Khirbat Silm, and 
Tulin. Citizen Hasan 'Ali Amin 'Awali was killed in al-Tamiriyah 
and many homes were damaged in the villages. 
  Bra'shit, Shaqra, and Majdal Silm towns and Wadi al-Saluqi 
came under bombardment this morning. The resistance men 
retaliated this afternoon by attacking the militia [South 
Lebanese Army] positions in 'Alman and al-Shumariyah and 
detonated an explosive charge under a Lahdist patrol on the road 
leading to these two positions. 
  The resistance men this morning attacked positions of the 
enemy and its agents in Bra'shit, Bayt Yahun, Saydun, and 
al-Suwayda'. Casualties among the personnel manning these posts 
were not known because the occupation forces' security cordon 
around the area. [end recording]

  [Text] Our correspondent in Rashayya reports that an 
armored Israeli unit consisting of a tank and 15 soldiers 
advanced 1 km north of the border strip from its positions on 
the hill of Kawkaba. The force raked the area of Qilya and 
Dallafah with heavy machine guns for one hour. No casualties 
have been reported. 
  Meanwhile, our correspondent in Tyre cited arrivals from the 
border strip that the Israeli forces reinforced their positions 
in the western and central sectors with artillery batteries, 
tanks, and personnel carriers. This followed the recent 
resistance operations against a number of joint Israeli-South 
Lebanese Army posts. 
  In a related development, Israeli warplanes flew over the 
western and central sectors today, breaking the sound barrier.

<F P=106> [Tariq Ibrahim report: "Disagreements and Rancors Among </F>
`Masses' of Lebanese Hizballah; `Iranian' Wing Contests 
Fadlallah `Jurisprudence,' Political Independence"] 
  [Excerpts] Beirut -- It is no longer a secret that the 
death of the supreme Shiite authority Mohammad Reza Golpayegani 
in December has provoked a direct confrontation between Muhammad 
Husayn Fadlallah, the Shiite cleric, and the Qom seminary in 
Iran. This crisis has affected the relationship between 
Fadlallah and Lebanese Hizballah, which is supported by Iran. 
The wing opposed to Fadlallah has succeeded in causing 
organized "confusion" among its followers and supporters, both 
in the southern suburb and Beirut. It seems that they have for 
some time time been preparing a "bill of indictment" against 
Fadlallah, pending Tehran's "verdict." 
  The indictment includes the following: 
  -- His public assertion of the weakness of the historic 
Shiite story about the misdeed of Fatimah al-Zahra', daughter of 
the prophet (peace be upon him) and wife of 'Ali Bin-Abu-Talib, 
to Caliph 'Umar Bin-al-Khattab. 
  -- His opposition to the possible takeover of the supreme 
authority position by 'Ali Khamene'i, guide of the Islamic 
revolution, when the current authority Mohammad 'Ali Araki dies. 
  It is said that a video was sent to Tehran, showing 
Fadlallah 
attacking Khamene'i. 
  The first accusation is considered a violation of the common 
Shiite belief, and the second has been exploited for political 
ends in order to place the accused in a direct confrontation 
with Khamene'i. [passage omitted] 
  The other aspect of this dispute is reflected in the context 
of talk of the need for the "Shiite scene" in Lebanon to remain 
separate from the religious leadership in Tehran. Maybe what 
Ja'farite Mufti in Lebanon Shaykh 'Abd-al-Amir Qabalan said on 
10 December 1993, namely that "the Islamic republic [of Iran] is 
responsible for safeguarding the authority's affairs," is part 
of the bid to tighten the noose around Fadlallah's movements in 
Lebanon. 
  Fadlallah rejects this dark and tense picture of his 
relationship with Tehran. He attributes everything said about 
his differences with it to "people trying to fish in muddy 
water." He says that anyone who tries to raise such issues is 
trying to "foment sedition." He does not rule out that the 
"intelligence service" could be behind this. Actually both 
Fadlallah and the Iranian leadership are trying to reunite the 
scene. Fadlallah may admit the existence of an overt battle 
that is not in his favor with Iran. While others believe that 
Tehran cannot abandon its relationship with Fadlallah, who has a 
"distinctive" position at both the Islamic and Shiite levels.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin believes that there 
will not be a breakthrough in the deliberations on a peace 
agreement with Jordan in the coming months, but there will be 
progress on other issues. The Jordanians, Mr. Rabin said, have 
raised three issues: water, border demarcation, and refugee 
return. Israel has made it clear that there is nothing to 
discuss on the refugee issue since that belongs to the 
negotiations with the Palestinians, and even then only in 
discussions on the permanent settlement. Mr. Rabin also said 
there are signs that the gaps are closing in the deliberations 
with the Palestinians, but that we have to be careful and not 
make overly optimistic statements. He also said that even if an 
agreement is reached in Foreign Minister Peres meeting with 
'Arafat in Davos, there will still be a need to discuss economic 
issues in Taba and Paris. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports 
that the prime minister made the remarks when he left the 
Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 24 January 
quotes Mr. Rabin as saying that "the peace process with Syria 
will be decided this year. In a recorded passage, Mr. Rabin 
says: `I have no doubt that 1994 will decide which direction 
developments take in the longer run -- especially with Syria and 
perhaps with other elements in the Arab world: whether there 
will be peace or deadlock and tension, with all the subsequent 
ramifications, but not necessarily war in late 1994.'" 
  The report quotes Mr. Rabin as also saying "he does not want 
to forecast what the direction will be, but the present 
circumstances give peace a chance. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir 
reports that on leaving the Knesset House Committee, Mr. Rabin 
was also asked about Major General 'Uzi Dayan's remarks that a 
rupture in the process with Syria could lead to war. Rabin said 
the use of the word war was unfortunate, and he would have been 
more careful in his remarks."]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Anat Peleg] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's meeting with about 
2,800 high school seniors at the Mann Auditorium in Tel Aviv 
ended some 30 minutes ago. His entrance, as well as his 
remarks, was met with mixed reactions: applause along with boos. 
  We are tomorrow's soldiers, the students said, asking the 
prime minister how al-Asad's Sunday [16 January] news conference 
in Geneva affected his view of the essence of peace with Syria. 
The prime minister replied that President al-Asad's remarks did 
not meet his expectations. I was disappointed with the fact 
that President Clinton alone replied to the question on the 
nature of peace, Rabin said, but we will pursue the negotiations 
with Syria because we want to be able to look your parents 
straight in the eye. Under the Labor party platform, we are 
committed to act toward peace. 
  To the students' surprise, he dissociated himself from his 
pre-election statement that the Golan is an inseparable part of 
the State of Israel: 
  [Begin Rabin recording] You say that before the elections, I 
promised that the Golan Heights is an inseparable part of 
Israel. Show me where it was that I promised this before the 
elections! What did I say? [applause and boos] Never mind, 
never mind. [end recording] 
  He added: We have discussed territorial compromise, and we 
will act to achieve it. What are the red lines that warrant 
Israel's backing out of its agreement with the PLO? In his 
reply, Rabin warned of the implications of such a step: 
  [Begin Rabin recording] When a legally elected government 
signs an agreement but does not abide by it, you should know 
that the next day, Arab countries would see it as a license not 
to abide by their agreements with us. [applause] Nothing is 
more serious than that. [end recording] 
  The young people wanted to know how the prime minister will 
react to soldiers' disobeying orders to evacuate settlers in the 
territories. Rabin replied that disobedience motivated by 
political considerations would be the end of the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces]. 
  He chose to conclude with praise for the unique dedication 
and loyalty of Israeli youths, who go through compulsory army 
service duty as if they were volunteering.

  [Text] Major General Amnon Shahaq, deputy chief of staff, 
today briefed the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. 
Shahaq, who also heads the Security Committee of the Taba talks, 
said that the talks will resume on 31 January, provided that 
issues currently in disagreement will be settled in the upcoming 
meeting between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat. Our Knesset correspondent Tamar Asalem reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Asalem] Maj. Gen. Shahaq, deputy chief 
of staff, like all the other persons involved in the peace 
talks, is waiting for the results of the Peres-'Arafat meeting 
next weekend. Shahaq said that the prime minister and the 
foreign minister were briefed this morning about the Army's 
security stands, which will be presented in the meeting with 
'Arafat. If indeed agreements are made over the weekend, the 
Security Committee of the Taba talks will reconvene as soon as 
31 January. 
  Gen. Shahaq addressed the claim that Fatah Hawks have been 
joining Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and taking part in 
terror attacks against Israel: 
  [Shahaq] We have witnessed cases where some of those 
identified with the Fatah Hawks said they do not accept the PLO 
or Fatah authority, that they are quitting the organization, and 
that they will continue to fight against us. We, at the same 
time, stated that we will continue fighting them until we catch 
them. 
  [Asalem] Shahaq added that the PLO does not yet have full 
authority over the field, and cannot impose its will on 
individuals who quit Fatah. In any event, Shahaq said, the IDF 
will be in charge of capturing the fugitives until April. I do 
not know what status they will have in the eyes of the 
Palestinian police force, he added. 
  Gen. Shahaq stated that a real war is being waged in south 
Lebanon. 
  [Shahaq] This is war, waged daily in more than one way by 
more than one organization -- not just Hizballah fights us and 
the SLA [South Lebanese Army] there. The IDF and the SLA 
soldiers carry the burden of this war in south Lebanon. 
  [Asalem] Shahaq said that the number of incidents in the 
north has doubled last year, in comparison to 1992. 
Nevertheless, over the past several weeks, there has been a 
decline in the volume and nature of Hizballah activity. The 
Army explains this by the fact that Syria had pressured 
Hizballah before the Clinton-al-Asad summit last week. 
  Regarding Syria, Gen. Shahaq addressed himself to the 
remarks 
by Major General 'Uzi Dayan [that war may break out this year if 
the peace talks fail], and said that he fails to understand the 
storm they caused. According to Shahaq, Dayan was not 
presenting an evaluation of the situation, rather he presented 
working assumptions of the Planning Branch, which is a routine 
matter. 
  To conclude, Shahaq was asked about his personal stand 
regarding the fact that members of the Knesset committee have 
occassionaly been wondering about the involvement of military 
men in peace negotiations. Shahaq answered that he does not 
have a problem with this and, should he have a problem with it, 
he will present it to the appropriate officials. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by 'Eran Klein] </F>
  [Text] The defense establishment will receive a special 
allocation of 325 million shekels to finance the redeployment in 
Gaza and Jericho. An agreement to this effect was reached this 
week by top Finance and Defense Ministry officials. 
  The source of the allocation has not been established yet, 
but Finance Minister Avraham Shohat announced yesterday that he 
will refuse to approve a supplementary budget and that the funds 
will have to be created by changing the present budget 
priorities. 
  Under the agreement, 250 million shekels will be allocated 
for the evacuation and the construction of new headquarters, for 
new fences and roads, and for other evacuation-related expenses. 
Approximately 25 million shekels will be allocated for 
settlement security in the current year and about 25 million 
shekels for settlement security next year. The settlements in 
question are those situated in the territories and along the 
Green Line. 
  The Finance Ministry has rejected the demands for additional 
allocations from the defense establishment and other elements. 
It is believed in Jerusalem that the top Finance Ministry 
echelons may decide at some stage to finance some of the 
expenditures from the budget that had been earmarked for 
fighting the intifadah.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent in Jerusalem Nadav Shragay] </F>
  [Text] A joint governmental and Jerusalem Municipality 
committee of experts states that unless a series of activities 
involving construction and expansion is implemented in the 
greater Jerusalem area, the city will become a "deadend city," 
with Arab building activity closing in on the city from the 
south, north, and east. 
  An interim report submitted by the committee deals with the 
area that was to be included in the greater Jerusalem area by 
the national unity government in 1987 -- from Bet El in the 
north, Hebron in the south, Mitzpe Yeriho in the east, and Bet 
Shemesh in the west. The report states that "Jerusalem will 
wither" unless large areas within the greater Jerusalem area are 
treated as areas set aside for the city's expansion. 
  The classified report was submitted two days ago to Mayor 
Ehud Olmert and three of his aides -- Uri Lupoliansky, Me'ir 
Porush, and Shmu'el Me'ir -- who are in charge of planning and 
construction at the Jerusalem Municipality. 
  According to the committee's figures, 1.125 million people 
-- 
55 percent of them Jews and 45 percent Arabs -- currently reside 
in the greater Jerusalem area. Some 47 percent of the greater 
Jerusalem area residents -- 72 percent of them Jews and 28 
percent Arabs -- live in Jerusalem proper. The committee 
assesses that by 2010, the weight of the Arab population in 
Jerusalem itself will grow to 31 percent, with 69 percent Jews. 
  According to the report, 48 percent of the greater Jerusalem 
area population -- 90 percent of them Arabs and 10 percent Jews 
-- lives outside Jerusalem proper today. An additional 5 
percent of the population resides in "the rest of the district," 
mainly in the western part of the greater Jerusalem area. 
  In one of the working papers submitted to the directors 
general committee on Jerusalem in the last few years, it was 
stated that "it will be necessary to operate in the greater 
Jerusalem area -- within the city's municipal borders and beyond 
them -- on the basis of two different sets of laws. At the same 
time, it will be impossible to act toward maintaining a 
demographic balance and to expand construction within 
Jerusalem's municipal area without implementing compatible, 
albeit different, moves across the Green Line." 
  The interim report submitted by the committee outlines such 
moves. One of the experts involved in the Greater Jerusalem 
area planning work has said that what is involved here is a de 
facto annexation of the area surrounding the city, even if this 
is camouflaged in various formulations. 
  According to the expert, the obvious intention is to award 
the Jerusalem area a special status within the framework of any 
possible future arrangement on the West Bank. Even if this area 
will not be under the jurisdiction of Israeli law, it will have 
a clear, practical link to Jerusalem. 
  In order to attain this objective, the committee recommends 
expanding Ma'ale Adumim in the direction of Jerusalem; linking 
it territorially to Pisgat Ze'ev; linking Giv'at Ze'ev to the 
Ramot neighborhood; and expanding the 'Etzyon Bloc toward Betar 
and the 'Adulam region. 
  The committee recommends that road No. 45 from Modi'in to 
'Atarot in northern Jerusalem be built immediately and that all 
the land necessary be expropriated toward that end. The 
committee's plans call for creating "joint Jewish-Arab zones" 
for industrial and tourism projects between Modi'in and 'Atarot 
along road No. 45. 
  The committee also recommends separating Arab and Jewish 
residential areas and treating the greater Jerusalem area as a 
unified functional space with open borders and a joint economic 
framework with Jerusalem. 
  The committee's steering team, which is continuing the 
greater Jerusalem area planning work, is headed by Shemaryahu 
Kohen, formerly head of the Jerusalem District in the 
Construction and Housing Ministry, and Professor Adam Mazor.

  [Excerpts] The fate of yesterday's Knesset vote on the 
opposition resolution over the future of the Golan Heights 
remains in question, with the Likud threatening legal action 
against the Knesset speaker. Knesset Speaker Shevah Weiss has 
decided to refer the matter to the Knesset's legal adviser. 
  The Likud statement, calling for a continued Israeli 
presence 
on the Golan, was defeated by one vote, but four opposition MK's 
[Knesset Members] said their votes were not registered even 
though they pressed the correct button in the electronic vote. 
Now Knesset Speaker Shevah Weiss says he is willing to hold the 
vote again next week, if both sides agree, but as David Ze'ev 
reports, the Likud wants him to change the result without a 
revote. 
  [Begin Ze'ev recording] Likud caucus chairman Moshe Qatzav 
says he is considering going to the High Court if House Speaker 
Shevah Weiss does not reverse the outcome of the plenum vote on 
the statement over the future of the Golan Heights. The 
coalition declaration of the Labor party and the Meretz bloc at 
the end of the Golan debate was endorsed without controversy. 
It said simply that the Knesset registers before it the 
government's position on the Golan Heights as stated by Deputy 
Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur earlier in the debate. But the 
statement by the opposition -- Likud, Tzomet, and the National 
Religious Party -- borrows terminology from the Labor platform, 
a move to embarrass the government. It calls for maintaining an 
Israeli military and settlement presence on the Golan. It 
failed by one vote, but four opposition MK's say their votes 
were not registered, and, in fact, on the Knesset computer sheet 
their names do not appear. [passage omitted] 
  There are two issues at stake. One is a Knesset rule which 
says that the House speaker must change the result of a vote 
accordingly if Knesset members inform him of a problem after the 
voting procedure has been completed. That is the point 
emphasized by the Likud's Moshe Qatzav, who says the House 
speaker is distorting the will of the Knesset. But the speaker 
counters with what he says is the dangerous precedent that would 
be established if MK's start complaining that the computerized 
voting system sometimes gives the wrong result. [end recording]

  [Text] There has been an upheaval in the Union of Local 
Authorities in Israel. Karmi'el Mayor 'Adi Eldar has emerged 
victorious in the struggle to head the union. Eldar belongs to 
the Labor party. He won with a small margin of votes over his 
predecessor, Likud activist Maxim Levi. The third candidate, 
Eli Landau from Herzliyya, garnered 23 votes, later claiming 
that by drawing votes away from Maxim Levi he had influenced the 
results. 
  Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, who 
directed Eldar's election campaign, said that it was the Arab 
vote that had proved decisive. The voting turnout was 100 
percent. 'Adi Eldar, the elected chairman, praised Maxim Levi 
for exhibiting fair play. He said that he would enact changes 
in the Union of Local Authorities in Israel, noting that from 
now on all local council heads and mayors in Israel would work 
together.

  [Text] The National Religious Party [NRP] has submitted a 
motion of no confidence in the government over the decision to 
evict yeshiva students from the ancient Jericho synagogue. The 
case involves a building the Civil Administration plans to 
renovate and open to the public as an archaeological site. 
  Knesset Member Hanan Porat, one of the initiators behind the 
motion, says the prime minister has told his aides that he does 
not want the yeshiva to remain on that site under autonomy. 
Members of the improvised Jericho yeshiva have decided to guard 
the place in shifts in a bid to prevent eviction by the Army. 
This was reported by our correspondent Ron Nesi'el.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Major General Yitzhaq 
Mordekhay, commander of the Northern Command, told our army 
affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David tonight that Hizballah has 
been trying for 24 hours to escalate the confrontation in 
Lebanon. 
  [Begin recording] [Ben-David] Now that the meeting with 
President Clinton is over, have the Syrians let the reins loose 
again in Lebanon? 
  [Mordekhay] It was anticipated that on the day the talks 
open in Washington they will escalate the situation and try to 
make Hizballah and the confrontation in Lebanon the top news 
item, since this has usually been the way they have acted when 
talks begin. I believe we have the necessary answers and the 
confrontation continues in the security zone. 
  [Ben-David] Do you think that as long as the negotiations 
continue and no progress is made there the Syrians will continue 
to conduct the war in Lebanon? 
  [Mordekhay] We believed in the past and still believe that 
if the Syrians want, they can significantly restrain Hizballah 
activities in south Lebanon against the security zone, the SLA 
[South Lebanese Army] and against Israel. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1900 GMT on 24 January 
reports that "SLA soldiers managed to foil a terrorist attempt 
to overtake an SLA outpost in the 'Alman al-Shumariyah area in 
the security zone. Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that 
Hizballah fired mortars and katyushas at the outpost, and under 
cover of the shelling tried to capture the post, but were warded 
off. An SLA soldier was killed, and two were wounded in the 
attack. IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and SLA troops pursued the 
terrorists."]

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Three reports in Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ and 
one in Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on 20 January carry 
data presented by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] on the number 
of incidents and casualties during military activity in 1993. 
  A report from the Knesset by Gid'on Alon and Tzvi Zrahya on 
page A6 of HA'ARETZ cites a report presented yesterday to the 
Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee by Major General 
Yoram Ya'ir, head of the IDF Personnel Branch. According to the 
report, "45 IDF soldiers were killed in enemy activity last 
year; 26 of them were killed in the security zone in south 
Lebanon and 19 were killed in the territories of Judaea, 
Samaria, and the Gaza Strip." The figures indicate a 
"significant rise in the number of IDF casualties from enemy 
activity; 24 soldiers were killed in 1992, and 11 in 1991." 
  Gen. Ya'ir further reports that, compared to 37 fatalities 
due to accidents in 1992, 17 IDF soldiers were killed in 
accidents in 1993, according to the following breakdown: seven 
soldiers were killed in military traffic accidents, five in 
operational accidents, three in gun and ammunition accidents, 
one in a labor accident, and one other was electrocuted. "Gen. 
Ya'ir noted with satisfaction that not a single soldier was 
killed in training accidents last year (as compared to 10 
fatalities in 1992)." The report cites Gen. Ya'ir as saying 
that "despite the efforts the IDF has made to prevent suicides, 
38 soldiers committed suicide last year (31 standing Army, four 
career soldiers, and three reservists)." Ya'ir notes that in 
only two of the cases, a direct link was established between the 
suicide and the soldier's military service. 
  Knesset correspondent Gabi Bron and military correspondent 
Arye Kiesel write on page 13 of YEDI'OT AHARONOT: "In 1993, 
there was a dramatic rise in reports of 'near casualty' in IDF 
accidents: 1,080, as compared to several hundred in 1992." The 
report further says that "in 1993, there was a dramatic drop in 
the number of aerial accidents in the IDF, when compared to the 
dozens of such accidents in the 1970's and 1980's. The damage 
caused by fatal aerial accidents last year stands at $14 
million, as compared with $170 million in damages by the end of 
the 1970's." 
  Citing data presented by "officers at the Central Command 
summing up last year's statistics," HA'ARETZ military 
correspondent Eytan Rabin writes on page A5: "In 1993, there 
was a rise in the number of armed terror attacks against Israeli 
targets in the territories. At the same time, there was a 
48-percent drop in the total number of terror attacks, as 
compared to 1992." Rabin says that "the majority of terror 
attacks in the territories in 1993 was directed against the 
Jewish settlers, and 15 of the 20 military and civilian 
fatalities were killed in armed attacks." The report cites the 
following figures for last year: there were 994 attacks against 
IDF troops and collaborators, as compared with 1,917 in 1992; 
16,253 stone-throwing incidents and riots were registered in 
1993, compared with 19,627 in 1992; and in 1993, the IDF 
arrested 4,410 Palestinian residents. 
  The correspondent adds that, leading last year's armed 
terror 
attacks, were fugitives from the various terror organizations. 
He adds that the security forces managed to foil "a large 
number of attacks by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. The 
number of these attacks rose after the closure was imposed on 
the territories." The report adds that most of the Hamas 
fugitives were killed in IDF operations or suicide attacks last 
year. The report adds that "153 incidents in which settlers 
rioted were registered in 1993. Of them, seven included the use 
of fire arms, and damage was caused to 34 cars and 10 houses." 
  Eytan Rabin cites another IDF document on page A1 of 
HA'ARETZ, which says that in 1993, 400 Palestinians were hurt in 
the West Bank; 64 of them were killed, 50 were seriously 
injured, and 286 were lightly to moderately injured. "The 
document indicates that between July and December 1993, eight 
Palestinian children under 10 years of age were shot by IDF 
troops, and at least two of them were killed." "An internal 
Central Command document" adds the following breakdown of 
Palestinian casualties of IDF fire: "21 aged between 11 and 16; 
49 aged between 17 and 22; 30 aged between 23 and 35; and 23 
were over 35 years old; at least two were over 80." 
  "IDF data for 1993 indicates that 13 Israeli civilians were 
killed in shooting incidents in the territories, three were 
seriously injured, five were moderately wounded, and 19 suffered 
light injuries."

  [Text] The Defense Ministry denies reports that it has 
proposed to turn Haifa Port into the home base of the 6th Fleet 
in the framework of the guarantees Israel will receive in 
exchange for withdrawing from parts of the Golan Heights. The 
denial was made in reaction to claims by Tzomet Knesset Member 
[MK] Eli'ezer Sandberg, who resides in Haifa. Our correspondent 
Shulamit Schmerling reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Schmerling] Tzomet MK Eli'ezer Sandberg 
fears that the Haifa Bay will be exposed to possible leaks of 
radioactive materials or even to a nuclear disaster if Haifa 
Port becomes the U.S. 6th Fleet's home base: 
  [Sandberg] A home base means the long-term physical presence 
of nuclear-powered vessels and ships carrying nuclear weapons in 
Haifa Bay. I queried the defense minister about this issue; I 
also asked whether the ongoing negotiations regarding turning 
Haifa Port into a home base for the 6th Fleet are somehow tied 
to Israeli promises of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights and 
meant as a sort of alternative security guarantee. 
  [Schmerling] The Defense Ministry's answer to the residents 
of Haifa is that there are no negotiations with the Americans on 
turning Haifa Bay into a home base for the 6th Fleet as an 
alternative in the event of a possible withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights. The Defense Ministry confirmed, however, that 
nuclear-powered vessels and submarines have visited Haifa Bay 
dozens of times. They have taken all possible precautions, 
however, while keeping the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, the 
Environment Ministry, and the Ports Authority informed and 
involved. The Defense Ministry promises that now, too, all the 
necessary measures are being implemented to make sure there are 
no leaks and disasters resulting from radioactive materials.

  [Text] Israeli circles in Washington welcome the 
anticipated appointment of Dr. William Perry as the next U.S. 
secretary of defense. President Clinton announced Dr. Perry's 
nomination yesterday, but it still requires congressional 
approval. The Israeli sources said that William Perry has 
evinced an extremely fair and professional attitude in all 
contacts with him over the last year in his capacity as deputy 
secretary of defense.

  [Text] Egypt is interested in selling gas to Israel and is 
concerned about the possibility that Israel will purchase 
natural gas from Qatar. The two countries have decided to set 
up a joint committee early next month to examine the possibility 
and feasibility of importing gas from Egypt. 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that 
following 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' and Energy Minister Moshe 
Shahal's meetings with Qatari representatives in London, it has 
transpired that Qatar is interested in implementing the deal 
with Israel, but its economic viability is still being examined.

  [Text] Energy Minister Moshe Shahal has turned down an 
offer from Russia to sell nuclear technology to Israel. The 
minister has just returned from a visit to Russia, which 
included a tour of a nuclear power plant. The minister 
explained why he refused the offer: 
  [Begin Shahal recording] I am not in favor of entering or 
buying existing technology for nuclear power plants. I think 
that Israel and probably the world will have to wait many years 
for a new technology, a safer technology. The Russians 
mentioned that in the past, during the time when Professor Yuval 
Ne'eman was the minister of energy and afterwards in a meeting 
with Prof. Amnon Rubinstein, there were talks by the Israeli 
Government to have a sort of a joint venture for a nuclear power 
plant. I mentioned and I explained our policy that we are more 
interested in the scientific question, in cooperation together 
maybe with Russia and the United States, but for future 
technologies, not the existing ones. Basically, I would say the 
government is not involved in buying energy supply as it was 
some years ago. I explained the new structure that we have 
here. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Sharon Sade] </F>
  [Excerpts] U.S. President Bill Clinton's announcement that 
Israeli companies may bid for civilian tenders in the U.S. space 
industry was received by the Israeli defense industries with 
restraint and doubt. 
  Defense sources yesterday commented very cautiously 
regarding 
the practical implications of the U.S. announcement. Although 
they estimate that it implies a technological and political 
breakthrough, it is still early to determine whether Israel will 
be able to immediately reap the benefits of the decision. 
[passage omitted] 
  According to defense sources, Israel's involvement in the 
U.S. space market was nearly frozen last year by the State 
Department -- backed by the Pentagon -- when it tried to enter 
the market. 
  According to the sources, Israel needs to begin getting 
involved with the U.S. market now by seeking new business 
partnerships with local elements, and bidding jointly for the 
tenders. Even then, the sources said, there is no guarantee 
Israeli companies will win. Therefore, the declaration that 
this new approval would create many jobs in Israeli and U.S. 
needs to be qualified. [passage omitted]

  The incident took place a short time ago. The man who was 
stabbed, aged about 60, was working in his orange grove near the 
junction when an Arab, apparently a laborer working in the area, 
suddenly attacked him with a knife. The man died a few minutes 
later. The assailant fled, and large police forces are 
conducting a manhunt for him.

  [Text] Relaxed and optimistic, Yasir 'Arafat yesterday 
spoke with two Israeli journalists covering Holst's funeral in 
Oslo. 
  "I hope the meetings with Peres will bring about a 
breakthrough in the negotiations," said the PLO chairman. Asked 
by the YEDI'OT AHARONOT correspondent whether he is close to a 
decision on signing the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, 'Arafat 
responded: "The decision is not only mine. There is another 
side, too." 
  Asked for his assessment on the effects of Basil al-Asad's 
death on the Israeli-Syrian negotiations, 'Arafat answered: "I 
do not know. I personally lament the death of Basil. I knew 
him when he was still a boy, when al-Asad was a major in the 
Syrian Air Force. I deeply regret his death." 
  'Arafat was asked whether Syria is heading for a separate 
agreement. His answer: "Al-Asad took care to convene the Arab 
leaders prior to departing for Geneva in order to receive their 
blessing. This is the way to practice politics!" 
  'Arafat said there are still four issues under discussion 
between Israel and the PLO. 'Arafat's aides -- Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh, Akram Haniyah, and Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] -- 
sounded a little more optimistic. Haniyah said the first 
meeting with Peres increased his optimism regarding the chances 
for an agreement. 'Abd-Rabbuh said: "God willing."

  [Text] The emergency session of the National Council of War 
Veterans opened in the Aurassi Hotel in Algiers today with a 
speech delivered by the chairman of the Higher State Council 
[HCE] and secretary general of the National Organization of War 
Veterans. 
  In his address, 'Ali Kafi dealt with the current situation 
in 
the country and the national conference scheduled for next 
Tuesday and Wednesday [25, 26 January]. Over to you, Mahfud. 
  [Mahfud] 'Ali Kafi said that the national conference was 
nothing but the result of great efforts that have been made 
since 1992 and thus the HCE had the duty to open the doors for a 
meeting with all the parties in the dialogue in order to consult 
in depth about the crisis, so that strong foundations can be 
laid for the Algerian state. 
  'Ali Kafi added that the HCE was keen to preserve the 
dialogue and its aims were to sum up the views of the parties in 
the dialogue within a draft formula for the national platform, 
which permits the achievement of a national consensus, i.e. the 
evolving national proposal. 
  The HCE chairman and secretary general of the National 
Organization of War Veterans did not hide the fact that some 
parties engaged in one-upmanship and maneuvering during the 
increasing events experienced by the country. He also wondered: 
At the expense of whom is this behavior taking place? 
  He said that history would not have mercy on wavering people 
and those who maneuver and sometimes conspire against the 
Algerian nation. In this context, 'Ali Kafi called on parties 
to go to the conference and on everyone to work to make it 
successful by giving new hope to the Algerian people through a 
serious dialogue and concessions by all parties and to stand as 
one against whoever wants to destroy Algeria. 
  He said in particular: 
  [Begin Kafi recording] We say to all parties on the eve of 
this conference: Enough messing about, let us all go to the 
conference with everyone working to make it successful, to give 
new hope to the people who are looking at us and suffering. We 
must make this conference successful and we must give hope in 
order to restore the trust between the citizen and his party, 
and the citizen and his state, so that the political and social 
life of this country can return to normal. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Speech by leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at the opening </F>
session of the General People's Congress in Surt--live] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God. First of all, good morning 
to all of you. On the basis of an invitation from the General 
People's Congress [GPC] secretariat, I have come to attend this 
opening session. However, my fear is that foreign journalists 
and some observers might think that the GPC is a parliament and 
that I am a president. They are used to the traditional protocol 
whereby the head of state chairs the opening session of 
parliament. [passage omitted] 
  Regrettably, there are those who purposely practice 
blackouts 
on the people's authority and the people's direct democracy as 
part of the war against small peoples' aspirations and their 
attempts to liberate themselves, and as a way of belittling 
peoples by insisting that only big powers can impose their 
views, and that anything other than that is dictatorship. There 
are some hirelings who are paid to write and talk with a view to 
smearing people's authority. [passage omitted] 
  Other countries should take this experiment from us and 
benefit from it by learning from the Libyan people. Instead, 
they ridicule us from their arrogant, imperialist, and 
disdainful stands. Normally, they should encourage a small 
people seeking liberation. On the contrary, they are hostile to 
the Libyan people and deride their experiment, so much so that 
they do not talk about the people's congresses. 
  You have journalists here. Wait and see what they will 
write. They will not refer to the people's congresses and the 
people's authority. First, they will say the Libyan parliament. 
Then, some will say people's committees, and this is very 
deceitful. [passage omitted] 
  We are exposing the rancor and ill intentions of the Western 
colonialist powers and their lackeys, the hireling newspapers 
and agent rulers. We just want to expose them so that the 
people will read these newspapers and listen to the radios and 
laugh at them--the Voice of America, for example, when it says 
al-Qadhdhafi the dictator. This is a great country, supposed to 
be respectable, and peoples are expected to listen to its radio. 
When a Libyan listens to the Voice of America he falls on his 
back laughing when he hears it talk about al-Qadhdhafi, the 
Libyan dictator. 
  Thank God, this is a privilege and a blessing enjoyed by us 
Libyans in this country--love and brotherhood, and this is the 
unbeatable force with which we face up to the enemies. They 
have now realized that for Libya to be defeated, several million 
people, four or five million Libyans must first be defeated, one 
by one. But in other countries, if they topple a president then 
that is it, perhaps the people... [pauses] or they could incite 
a people against a president, or cause the defeat of a party in 
elections, forge elections and bring in another party against 
it, involve people in the farce of pluralism, bring economic 
pressure to bear against them, and threaten them militarily so 
as to cause the fall of a ruler, a government, or a party. 
[passage omitted] This would not exist in Libya where there is 
no foundation for it, because in Libya there is neither party, 
nor sect, nor ruler, nor government. 
  These facts give strength to the Libyan side. They give us 
determination and self-confidence that we will win in any 
confrontation, and they undermine the will of the enemies. 
[passage omitted] We are determined to enter into a 
confrontation and we are 100 percent confident in victory in the 
end, no matter how long the battle may be, and it should be 
long. [applause] [passage omitted] We would have thought, after 
the insignificant Reagan, that the American administration--the 
current republic or democracy--we, and all reasonable people, 
would have thought that, had there been a conscience in this 
world, America would apologize to the Libyan people and to the 
families of the innocent victims--children and women in Benghazi 
and Tripoli--that it would give compensation to those who accept 
it, and be sorry for all its life toward the Libyans and mankind 
for having committed a horrible barbaric massacre against 
children in 1986. On the contrary, here they are, forgetting 
all this and pursuing us again, threatening us, laying siege 
to us, and seeking more human victims. This means that 
conscience is dead. This is a dangerous moral decline in the 
world and in big powers. [passage omitted] 
  They are holding us responsible for Lockerbie--the Pan-Am 
crash--as if our sons who died in 1986 were mice, and your sons 
are human beings. What is our link with an airplane that 
crashed in the North Pole? Even if we did this, they should 
still be ashamed and keep quiet. They should say: we killed the 
Libyans' sons in their sleep. It was a mistake. Reagan was 
crazy and insignificant. He did a great deal of harm to the 
American reputation in the world. He committed a horrible crime 
that made America speechless and very embarrassed. Let us turn 
a blind eye to Lockerbie even if the Libyans are behind it. 
Despite the fact that we did not do it, they are still after 
us. They are holding us responsible no matter what. [passage 
omitted] 
  The UN Security Council asked Libya to cooperate with a 
French investigation and Libya expressed its readiness to 
cooperate with the French investigation and informed France. 
France refused the investigation out of solidarity and linked 
the UTA issue to the Lockerbie question. What is the link 
between UTA in Niger and Pan-Am at Lockerbie? 
  France does not want a solution and took a stance which 
contradicts that of the UN Security Council. If there were a 
real UN Security Council which was not under Western hegemony, 
it would meet and pass a resolution against France, declare 
Libya not guilty, and drop this aspect from the resolutions and 
the issue, considering that Libya has fulfilled its commitments 
toward France and it is the latter that refused. After that the 
council would have to condemn France. [passage omitted] 
  Yesterday, Dr. Swire, the chairman of the Association of the 
Lockerbie Airliner Victims, made a proposal and said that The 
Hague was an approriate place for the trial, and should the 
English want to hold this trial, let them move to The Hague. 
This is the chairman of the Lockerbie victims association who 
said this. 
  They are telling the world: We, the U.S. and UK Governments, 
are under pressure from the Lockerbie victims association, at a 
time when the chairman of the Lockerbie victims association is 
saying before the world: I am not obstinately attached to a 
trial in Scotland, and even The Hague is an appropriate place. 
So, their argument is no longer valid. 
  Should someone claim responsibility for Lockerbie now, they 
would not be able to recognize their mistake. Because they have 
already involved the Security Council against Libya, it would 
not be able to deal with an unidentified criminal. Let us 
suppose that one person was involved in the Pan-Am explosion 
over Lockerbie, they would obliterate all the facts, because 
this would put them in a very embarrassing position. How could 
the Security Council be involved in an issue because it was told 
that a country was behind it, and all of sudden an unidentified 
person claims responsibility for this act? How could the 
Security Council issue resolutions against this person? Would 
it deprive him of spare parts? Would it break off diplomatic 
relations with him, with Carlos for example? The Security 
Council would become a joke in this case. Consequently, no 
matter how much evidence there might be, the Security Council 
would not heed them, on the orders of the Western countries, so 
that they would not get into difficulties in front of the world. 
It must be Libya. Even if another country were proved to be 
involved, they would not admit it. It must be Libya. 
  This is what made the Libyan people angry; this is what made 
them revolt, and prepare for confrontation. This issue has 
become one of defiance, confrontation, and blatant injustice 
which can only be met with resistance. [passage omitted] 
  There is yet another factor that had prompted the Libyan 
people to engage in revolution. Now they are saying that the 
Libyan people are escalating the crisis, al-Qadhdhafi is 
escalating the crisis. Indeed we have been more patient than 
Job. There is a saying which says: Job's patience is adoration 
of God, and a fools' patience is silly. We have been patient 
for a long time, and it is you [the West] that are escalating 
the crisis. [passage omitted] After all this patience, 
perseverance, give and take, our brandishing an olive branch, 
cordiality, and even courting of the Western states, they 
surprised us with Resolution 883 or I do not know which number. 
Then they say the Libyans are escalating the crisis. But why 
you are escalating the crisis? What do you want? 
  Yesterday, the UN commissioner told our foreign secretary: 
you are escalating, and this is unsettling. But you, for your 
part, are not you escalating? Very nice, you want us to retreat 
while you escalate the crisis. So long as there is escalation 
we must face up to escalation, and so long as there is 
confrontation we must face up to confrontation. The Libyan 
people have been wronged and must confront and resist 
wrongdoing. [applause] 
  What made the Libyan people angry too was something at the 
pan- Arab level. Brothers, these days we are hearing a slogan 
being raised and we are required to carry it out. It is very 
grave. It is the slogan of land for peace. This is the gravest 
slogan. This misleads the revolution from Syria to Mauritania, 
not just in Libya. O Arabs, the slogan of land for peace is 
grave. It means that it legitimizes and permits occupation for 
the realization of other objectives: you occupy land and then 
pose the condition you want. If you meet their condition they 
give you the land back. This is very serious. [passage omitted] 
  This is the gravest of slogans. The slogan of land for peace 
is the gravest of slogans and it must be torn up even at the 
price of millions of Arabs and a sea of blood. This slogan 
should be torn asunder. It is a very serious slogan as far as 
the future of the Arab nation is concerned. Land for peace? 
First, according to the UN Charter acquisition of land by 
force is not permitted. Therefore, the Jews have no right to 
occupy Sinai or the Golan or southern Lebanon. They should 
withdraw from these territories unconditionally. This was 
approved by the world from the first day--the world said that 
there should be an unconditional withdrawal. The withdrawal from 
Sinai, the Golan, and southern Lebanon has no connection at all 
with the question of Palestine. 
  They should withdraw from Egyptian territories 
unconditionally; the enemy should withdraw from the territories 
of Syria, otherwise Syria should fight this enemy to make it 
withdraw unconditionally--either Syria fights this enemy or this 
enemy withdraws from Syrian territories. This has no relation 
whatever with recognition at all. The same applies to southern 
Lebanon. With regard to the West Bank, this is part of Jordan. 
Gaza is part of Egypt. In 1967 some Egyptian territories were 
occupied--Sinai including Gaza. Gaza belongs to Egypt. 
Throughout the years it belonged to Egypt. It was not 
Palestinian land before 1967. It is Egyptian territory. The 
West Bank belongs to Jordan as far as the armistice line. It 
was occupied when it was Jordanian territory in 1967. 
  The same thing applies to the Golan--it is Syrian territory 
which was occupied. Therefore it is the right of Syria, Jordan, 
and Egypt to unconditionally retrieve their territories because 
they were occupied by force. They will be supported in this by 
the entire world. It is serious when someone deliberately 
intends to occupy your land in order to impose conditions on 
you. This is very serious. The Palestinian question has not 
been solved; no one has touched it, either in Gaza, or in 
Jericho, or anywhere else. Jericho is a spot in the West Bank 
and the latter belongs to Jordan and was occupied in 1967. 
Jordan has the right to demand unconditionally all its 
territories which were occupied in 1967. Syria should insist on 
the return of the Golan unconditionally. This has no connection 
whatsoever with the Palestinian question because the Palestinian 
question existed and the struggle for it existed long before the 
occupation of the Golan. Sinai was occupied while the 
Palestinian question was in existence; the question had no 
connection whatever with the occupation of Sinai. The 
Palestinian question has existed since 1948 and before, while 
Sinai and the Golan were occupied in 1967. Lebanon was occupied 
recently--in 1982, or what? Yesterday they occupied southern 
Lebanon. It has nothing to do with the question of Palestine. 
Tomorrow they may say: who has not recognized us? Libya, 
Algeria, Iraq, Sudan, and so on. They have not recognized us. 
All right, go and occupy part of their territories. Land for 
peace--we give you your land which we occupied and you establish 
peace with us. This is very serious. I am astonished--and I 
call on the Ba'th Party which is ruling Syria--this pan-Arab 
party for the sake of which people were imprisoned and young 
people lost their future in the 1960's, while people died for 
it; it used to be the party raising the banner of Arab 
nationalism. It was the one which fought in Palestine. 
It is not possible that the end of the Syrian Ba'th Party would 
be recognition of Israel in exchange for the Golan. The Golan 
should be returned either through the United Nations or through 
war. The Syrian people have the right to fight to recover the 
Golan. [passage omitted] 
  The Libyan people are ready to embark upon a long battle. By 
God, even if we all die we will not accept this injustice; we do 
not accept land for peace or the recognition of Israel at all. 
We recognize the democratic Palestinian State which encompasses 
Jews and Arabs. Israel is an innovation which we do not know, 
the Israeli world does not exist in geography. [passage 
omitted]. 
  Brother ambassadors, tell the rulers who now are racing to 
embrace Israelis and please the West that they might regret it; 
perhaps America will blow up like the Soviet Union and you might 
get up one morning and not find it there. Anything is possible 
to God, and he can do this. We only believe in God who has the 
power. [applause] 
  You might get what happened to those who were worshipping 
Moscow and were saying: The great Soviet Union, the red 
universe, the red flag will cover the earth and there is nothing 
but Marxism-Leninism. The god of the Soviet Union died; the poor 
people became orphans looking for someone to protect them. They 
asked for God's forgiveness saying that they were not 
communists. [passage omitted] Have no fear as your enemy, in 
the first place, is an exploiting capitalist who will collapse. 
Do not say that this enemy is on the ascendant. The enemy is 
descending. It is on its deathbed. The entire West is 
experiencing death. It is covered with a thick cover but it is 
collapsing from within. [passage omitted ] Your enemy is made 
of glass and will break and destroy itself. 
  There is now a struggle for Serbia. They are divided over 
Serbia. It may appear to be a dangerous struggle and break-up 
in Europe over Serbia, beginning with Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Naturally the issue does not concern Bosnia-Herzegovina. All 
the others are in agreement regarding the liquidation of the 
Muslims. All of them--Russia, America, and so on --have decided 
not to recognize a Muslim people in Europe; Europe is 100 
percent Christian--this is what they have decided. 
  As for the Arabs, they should accept a Jewish state in 
Muscat and a racist Israeli state at that, armed with nuclear 
weapons. America is pursuing North Korea and says to it: We 
should inspect your installations; you should not have nuclear 
weapons. Why does not America pursue the Israelis who have more 
than 200 nuclear warheads? These are the things which make the 
Libyan people angry. He who does not become angry is without 
conscience; he is a slave. Anyone seeing this arrogance would 
get angry. Is it logical to see them pursuing Korea and 
leaving the Israelis? They should pursue all those who have 
nuclear weapons. Look at the racist policy. When they saw 
South Africa becoming a black country, they began to [word 
indistinct] its nuclear capability. When the whites had that 
country they turned a blind eye to it although they knew that it 
was about to manufacture nuclear weapons. [passage omitted] 
  Recently they came to Egypt and said that that country 
should 
sign a treaty banning the manufacturing of chemical weapons. 
Egypt told them that the Israelis have not signed anything, not 
even the treaty banning the proliferation of nuclear weapons, 
and now you are asking us to sign the treaty banning the 
manufacture of chemical weapons. I do not sign. If there is a 
state most feared by the Israelis it is Egypt. Egypt was the 
first Arab state to recognize the Israelis and so on, but the 
real cultural defiance felt by Egypt is not felt by any other 
Arab country. Egypt knows that along its border there is a 
traditional enemy. [passage omitted] 
  Take American justice and this young man Clinton; he is a 
good man and a man of peace--he does not hate anyone in the 
world, but the poor man must believe the policies the Americans 
are involving us in when they tell him to go after Libya, or 
Korea, or wherever, because they have nuclear weapons. Who 
believes him if he does not pursue the Israelis? No matter how 
good he may be, the poor man is the victim of the imperialist 
policy; they treat him as they did Kennedy. They may get rid of 
this poor man as they did Kennedy. If he does not go along with 
them they will get rid of him. 
  The CIA, the American Central Intelligence Agency--I hope 
someone brave will come along one day and disband and destroy 
it. It is this that sabotaged the world; this notorious agency 
has brought the United States into disrepute and the whole world 
into disrepute. It has undermined the world. It is like 
woodworm and poison. It played havoc with governments and 
regimes and the economy, the dollar, and currencies and 
everything. It is behind the undermining of the entire world. 
One hopes that a brave man will come along and do something and 
deliver America and the American people and the world of this 
nightmare called CIA. It has spread its nets everywhere. You 
are aware of all this. Your sons might be among those caught in 
these nets. Everyone in this whole world is worried about his 
children lest they get caught in the CIA's nets. The CIA is 
like a deadly disease. The CIA forges money, the dollar, and 
the currencies of the whole world. It has long arms and it has 
devilish plots. [passage omitted] How can Clinton escape from 
it, the poor man? How can he free himself of it, no matter how 
good a man he may be or how much he is a man of peace? How can 
he get rid of this nightmare short of dissolving it? If he did 
this, he would be able to breathe easy. 
  There are some imperialist quarters which are very, very 
dangerous and against freedom and peace. They are to be found 
in America and the West and are more powerful than Clinton, more 
powerful than his administration, and more powerful than anyone 
who loves peace. If Abraham Lincoln or George Washington came 
back to life they would be powerless unless they destroyed and 
dismantled these nightmares. [passage omitted] 
  The same applies to America. If the National Security 
Council is not dismantled, and the White House which is like the 
Kremlin and the CIA which is like the KGB, no one, not the 
American people, will be liberated. What kind of freedom is 
this when they have these organizations? It is all lies if they 
say that have a free people, a free press. It is all lies. 
These claims are continually made by the West. They are the 
dictatorial regimes. Yet they accuse us of dictatorship. 
  Generally, they are beating the drums of confrontation with 
us. And not only with the Libyan people but with all the East. 
They are getting ready for a crusade. You must know that, 
after the end of communism, they decided to terminate Islam, the 
East, and the Arab nation. That is the gist of it. 
  They changed their tactics. They were confronting the Soviet 
Union, confrontation in Berlin, and now it has shifted to Rome. 
It has become North and South. It has become East and West. 
The East means the Islamic East--that is, the Arabs, or rather 
the Arabs first. The front line is the Arabs. The Arabs must 
be attacked and destroyed. Afterward they will go deep into 
Asia and all those countries. All their actions and their 
"Satanic Verses" have a great significance. We must not meet 
Abu Nidal or Ahmad Jibril. I very much regret that they have 
not accepted the invitation for them to come over here. They 
are supposed to accept the invitation and come so that I can 
meet them publicly. They are meeting with the leaders of the 
IRA and yet they forbid us to do so. They receive the author of 
"The Satanic Verses" who insulted Islam. Today they are making 
dancing dresses with Koranic verses printed on them in France or 
the nightclubs of France. One wonders if the Arabs or those who 
are defenders of Islam would protest to France or break off 
relations with France. They would not dare. [passage omitted] 
  We are warning the Egyptian people against those who have 
opened fire, the Algerian people against those who have opened 
fire, the Sudanese people against those who have been opening 
fire, the Lebanese people who are being trampled on, the 
Palestinian people who are being treated like a flock of sheep, 
and the Syrian people whose land is being occupied until it 
recognizes them. Tomorrow they will occupy Damascus so that they 
can impose more conditions on the Syrian people. We are warning 
all these people. 
  They destroyed Iraq and it was they who got Iraq into the 
Kuwaiti mess. It was they who destroyed Kuwait, and 
particularly Kuwait's oil. It was not even Saddam who set fire 
to Kuwait's oil. It was set on fire by America. All the 
technology which was used in burning Kuwaiti oil was Western 
technology. It was deliberate and intentional. They were the 
ones who set it on fire. They collaborated with Iraq, provided 
it with experts, gave it the capabilities, and told Saddam to 
set Kuwaiti oil on fire for reasons which concerned only them. 
Iraq would need a whole year to be able to set Kuwaiti oil on 
fire. It was a Western and an American action. It was 
intentional. It was America who plotted for Iraq's occupation 
of Kuwait. It told Iraq: In order to reward you for your war 
against Khomeyni we reward you with Kuwait. Take Kuwait. All 
this in order to destroy Iraq. These things are quite clear. 
  We are determined to live with dignity over our land. We can 
never accept living on this earth while we are lacking in 
sovereignty. One of us is a slave and the other is a master. 
We will fight this. We prefer death to acceptance of being 
their slaves, or surrendering to them, or allowing them to 
impose their injustice on us. Right is turned into wrong and 
vice versa. 
  They want to solve the Lockerbie case; there are a hundred 
solutions on the table. [passage omitted] 
  They can go wherever they wish to go. We have decided that 
we do not need the oil. Oil has now become like any other 
commodity. Today we are selling a barrel of oil at $10 while 
production costs are $6 per barrel. It means that a barrel of 
oil brings in $4. This is nothing. What can we do with $4? 
Today we are more or less living without oil because a barrel 
of oil is worth $4. [passage omitted] If we sell the water of 
the great man-made river we get double the price of the oil. 
  France does not want a solution. So be it. They do not want 
friendship. Let there be hatred. They do not want peace; let 
peace go to hell. What are we? Are we more desirous of peace 
or friendship than they are? What is our relationship with them 
? We do not need them. That is it. We have decided definitely 
to do without oil. If it continued, well and good, and if it 
did not--definitely we have made our decision to live without 
oil and live in the manner that suits us. 
  Today, we have electricity and this and that and air 
conditioning units; they must not think our independence and our 
freedom are dependent on them. When it comes to the real thing 
and the issue becomes an issue of dignity and an issue of 
existence and an issue of the future and they want on encroach 
on us, to hell with all these things. We shall go back to back 
to burning logs and do away with electricity [words indistinct 
drowned by applause] [passage omitted]. 
  Now they are asking why Libya has been escalating the 
situation. They are doing so because they are afraid that such 
an escalation would spread to other Arab countries and other 
peoples. 
  What they would like to see is that when they attack the 
rest 
should surrender. Once there is someone who says no, there 
should be no surrender, others might follow suit. They might 
say: Look, here is someone who has not surrendered; why then 
should we surrender?. And thus a new awakening might begin. 
  Yes, we should be exporting our people's revolution to the 
rest of the Arab nation because a sin is being committed there. 
First, the slogan Land for Peace must be burned. All right, 
peace requires a price so let us motivate the Arab nation to pay 
the price. Here we are not warmongers, as they have been 
claiming, nor are we calling for the destruction of Israel or 
anything like that. 
  However, the word Israel is a strange name which we do not 
comprehend. What we know is Palestine; Jews and Arabs should 
live in Palestine in a democratic state. We said this before. 
Peaceful solutions should mean, furthermore, that nuclear 
weapons and weapons of mass destruction must be removed from the 
Israelis. A democratic state, like that in South Africa, must 
be created; we should organize free elections and allow the 7 
million Palestinians to return because as long as the 7 million 
have not returned there will be no solution to this problem. 
  The Golan is, however, another problem; it is Syria's right 
to demand its return or to fight until its land has been 
liberated. But no one should ask it to recognize Israel at all. 
Syria has every right to liberate the Golan inch by inch and no 
one has any right to ask it to recongnize Israel. This is its 
land; it was occupied in 1967. What is dangerous here is 
linking the two things together. [passage omitted] 
  I would like here to salute the Libyan people for their 
pan-Arabism and for understanding the aims of the plot, as well 
as for their readiness for confrontation. We have no other 
choice than a confrontation; we have no choices left. But if 
they are looking for a solution with us they are welcome. If 
they choose peace we will reciprocate. Peace be upon you. 
[crowd applauds, chants]

  [Text] Surt, 23 Jan (MENA)--Abu-Zayd 'Umar Durdah, 
secretary of the General People's Committee--a title equivalent 
to prime minister--has praised Egypt's role and President 
Mubarak's sincere attempts to support Libya and ease the 
blockade imposed on it. 
  In a statement to journalists today, Durdah said cooperation 
with Egypt continues in all fields, especially the security 
field, noting that Egypt's security is also Libya's security. 
  On the fate of [kidnapped former foreign minister] Mansur 
al-Kihya, Durdah stressed that this issue is nothing but a 
suspicious attempt to undermine Egyptian-Libyan relations and to 
complete the blockade imposed on Libya. 
  Durdah did not play down the effects of the UN Security 
Council sanctions on the Libyan economy. He said Libya is now 
preparing its budget, taking these sanctions into consideration. 
In its own way it is trying to maintain the defense allocations 
and subsidies for next year the same as they were in last year's 
budget. 
  The General People's Congress committees have continued 
their 
discussions for the second day to draft and prepare the 
resolutions of the basic people's congresses. These resolutions 
will be announced tomorrow, while the final session of the 
General People's Congress will be held on Tuesday [25 January].

  [Text] Islamabad, Jan 23 (AFP) -- Afghan President 
Borhanoddin Rabbani Sunday [23 Jan] said he would allow the 
nation to choose a new leader, stressing that the country's 
war-ravaged situation would have to determine how this is done. 
  In a nationwide broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, Rabbani 
said he would accept the people's choice. 
  The embattled president, whose 18-month tenure ends in June, 
did not say if he was ready to immediately step down, as 
demanded by his rival, Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar. 
  Hekmatyar is allied with Uzbek warlord and former communist 
general Abdol Rashid Dostam, who staged a coup attempt on New 
Year's Day. The bloody power struggle continues to rage in 
Kabul three weeks after the failed coup. 
  "I am offering the people (the right) to choose a new 
leadership," Rabbani said, adding that the country's turbulent 
situation would have to dictate the manner in which this is 
accomplished. 
  A new leader could be chosen either through a consultative 
council of elders or through elections, Rabbani added. 
  However, he said if the nation opted for elections, the 
war-ravaged country would need assistance from the United 
Nations or the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC). The 
president did not set a deadline nor did he elaborate the 
mechanism. 
  Rabbani said the January 1 coup had been orchestrated 
outside 
of Afghanistan. "It was an external conspiracy," he said. 
  But he did not identify any foreign power. 
  The president's speech came as Kabul was plunged into one of 
the fiercest battles since he assumed office. 
  Rabbani said his forces would be ready to stop fighting 
against the mujahedeen of Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic 
Party of Afganistan] faction, "but the battle with Dostam troops 
would continue until the communist militia surrendered or was 
crippled." 
  "We can not allow conspirators to seize power by force," he 
vowed.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 23, IRNA -- The meddling of the West in 
northern Iraq is threatening the security and integrity of Iraq 
and its neighbors, commented KAYHAN HAVAI. 
  In its latest issue, the bilingual weekly referred to the 
crimes committed by Jalal Talebani's Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan (PUK) against members of the Islamic movement in 
northern Iraq. 
  According to the weekly, the PUK "attacks were seen as an 
attempt by Talebani, under the aegis of the U.S. and its allies, 
to squeeze groups who have no sympathy towards his pro-Western 
approach." 
  Noting that the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) has remained 
neutral in the conflict, it said there remains no doubt "about 
the meddling by U.S., Britain and France whose troops are 
serving their national interests in Iraq's northern no-fly zone." 
  It referred to Talebani's Washington visit in 1992 and his 
talks about establishing an opposition government in the 
northern no-fly zone. 
  Stressing that Washington's policy is to get rid of Kurdish 
groups, it said "the West makes use of Kurds as a leverage to 
put pressure on Saddam Husayn's government and influence 
developments in Iraq. 
  "To any analyst there is an important question unanswered. 
If there are troops to protect Kurds from attacks by Saddam's 
army in the northern no-fly zone for humanitarian reasons, why 
are there no troops to protect Shiite Muslims in marshlands in 
southern Iraq for the same reason?" 
  It said that Washington considers Muslims as troublesome and 
dangerous for America's interests and perhaps for this reason 
the anti-Iraq alliance abandoned the idea to topple Saddam's 
regime. 
  The weekly concluded that there is no accurate evidence to 
prove that the West supports the establishment of an independent 
state for Kurds but that their meddling in northern Iraq is 
threatening the regional security and integrity.

  [Text] Cairo, 23 Jan (MENA)--Palestinian president Yasir 
'Arafat arrived in Cairo early this morning on a short visit to 
Egypt. 
  'Arafat said in an arrival statement that he will brief 
President Husni Mubarak on the results of his meeting with 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Oslo. 
  'Arafat emphasized the importance of persistence to reach an 
agreement with Israel for the meticulous implementation of the 
Declaration of Principles, which was signed in Washington on 13 
September. 
  He said that there are many obstacles that have prevented 
the 
implementation of the agreement until now. We expect the 
Palestinian-Israeli talks to continue to overcome the obstacles, 
he added. 'Arafat said that he is hoping that President Mubarak 
will make efforts to remove these obstacles. 
  He noted that he will pay a visit to Saudi Arabia today to 
perform a mini-pilgrimage and meet with Saudi officials.

  [Text] Commenting on Foreign Minister Peres' meeting with 
Yasir 'Arafat in Oslo, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said 
Israel's insistence that security is a matter of principle is 
beginning to show results. The prime minister was speaking in 
Jerusalem to a large group of rabbis from the United States. He 
said agreement had been reached with the Palestinians on some of 
the issues, but not on control of the crossing points. Jack 
Katzenell reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Katzenell] Prime Minister Rabin said 
Israel and the Palestinians are near an agreement on some of the 
issues. For example, control of the roads to and from the 
Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip. But, there was still no 
agreement on the border crossing points. He said Israel must 
retain control of the Jordan bridges to check for arms or 
explosives and determine who is allowed to pass. 
  [Rabin] We don't want that influx of Palestinian refugees, a 
quarter of a million, will cross the passes because it is 
written in the DOP [Declaration of Principles] that the question 
of the refugees, that it has to be negotiated once we'll reach 
negotiations on the permanent solution. It is excluded to be 
dealt with during the creation of the interim period. 
  [Katzenell] More than 300,000 Palestinians and other Arabs 
visit the territories every summer, Rabin said. We welcome 
them, but we must know when they enter and whether they have 
left. Otherwise, we shall have a quarter of a million or half a 
million refugees returning in the interim period, and this is 
not sanctioned in the Declaration of Principles. 
  Turning to the negotiations with Syria, Rabin said President 
al-Asad has not yet clarified what he means by peace; whether he 
means open borders, diplomatic relations, and encouragement by 
the two governments of normal relations between the peoples. We 
do not expect al-Asad to come to Jerusalem as President al-Sadat 
did, Rabin said, but he has to understand better the way the 
Israeli people think. 
  [Rabin] Unfortunately, if you watch the last press 
conference in Geneva in which the two presidents, Clinton and 
al-Asad appeared -- in the press conference al-Asad didn't do 1 
percent of what al-Sadat did in coming to Jerusalem. It was 
President Clinton that answered Wolf Blitzer, and not President 
al-Asad. 
  [Katzenell] Rabin said he has invited al-Asad to Jerusalem 
10 times or more. I am willing to meet him in Damascus, in 
Jerusalem, anywhere on the globe, the prime minister said, 
without preconditions, except what has already been agreed 
between us. [end recording]

  [Text] Kabul, 22 Jan (MENA)--Mohammad Yunus Qanooni, head 
of the Afghan Defense Ministry's Political Department, has 
announced that the Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union] leader 
'Abdol Rasul Sayyaf is making earnest efforts to conclude a 
peace agreement between President Borhanoddin Rabbani and his 
opponent Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar and establish a 
cease-fire in the country. 
  In a statement to MENA's Kabul correspondent, Qanooni said 
that President Rabbani has no objection to starting discussions 
with Hekmatyar to resolve their dispute and that he is also 
willing to begin immediately forming election committees for 
elections to be held in six months. 
  The Afghan official described Hekmatyar's demand that the 
president resign as "unacceptable and part of the political 
maneuvering that Hekmatyar uses whenever he finds himself in a 
weak position." 
  Qanooni added: We have become accustomed to such maneuvers. 
Formerly Hekmatyar demanded the resignation of Defense Minister 
Ahmad Shah Mas'ud as a condition for solving all disputes with 
President Rabbani. President Rabbani was appointed by the Shura 
Council. 
  Qanooni pointed out that Hekmatyar cannot set conditions, 
because he cannot achieve a military victory. 
  The head of the Afghan Defense Ministry's Political 
Department said that President Rabbani will not accept any good 
offices to reach a cease-fire with the forces of the communist 
General Abdol Rashid Dostam who is considered a remnant of the 
former soviet rule of Afghanistan. 
  Qanooni added that the call to jihad which the Afghan 
president made against Dostam and which was responded to by all 
the country's mojahedin and ulema "must be implemented and 
cannot be retracted." 
  Asked about the results of the military clashes between the 
president's forces -- which include the forces of Ahmad Shah 
Mas'ud, the forces of Isma'il Khan, and the Jami'at-e Eslami 
[Islamic Society] forces -- on the one side and Dostam's forces 
on the other, Qanooni said that Dostam has lost more than 75 
percent of his positions inside and around Kabul. Additionally 
250 of his troops were killed and 960 captured. 
  He pointed out that the success of President Rabbani's 
forces 
in capturing the Microryan area and purging it of Dostam's 
forces had made it possible for them also to capture Miranjan 
Hill and Bala Hesar. He explained that these two positions were 
Dostam's last two positions around Kabul. 
  Asked to comment on international and regional attitudes to 
the current events in Afghanistan, Qanooni said that according 
to his own information, Moscow was seeking to replace the 
country's Islamic system with a regime loyal to it. At the same 
time, several regional powers believe that Hekmatyar was the 
most suitable person to help them attain their objectives in 
Afghanistan. 
  He added that Hekmatyar realized after the battles of Tagab 
and Sorubi that he would not be able to face President Rabbani's 
forces alone and therefore he sought an alliance with the 
communist General Abdol Rashid Dostam. 
  The head of the Afghan Defense Ministry's Political 
Department noted that the Western countries had adopted a 
wait-and-see attitude awaiting the consequences of Hekmatyar's 
and Dostam's "coup attempt". He pointed out, however, that they 
realized after one day of fighting at the beginning of the year 
that President Rabbani's regime was not an easy target. 
  On the current situation, Mohammad Yunus Qanooni said that 
President Rabbani's forces have evident superiority in Kabul, 
the areas surrounding it, and in northern Afghanistan.

  [Text] Peshawar, Jan 22 -- A four-member delegation, 
representing the four-party alliance fighting against Rabbani 
forces in Kabul, which had arrived in Peshawar on Thursday [20 
Jan], is expected to hold meetings with Afghan leaders based 
here on Sunday [23 Jan]. 
  According to reliable sources, the delegation which had been 
sent by Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar to explore 
avenues for finding a lasting solution to the Afghan imbroglio, 
could not meet Mowlawi Yunus Khales and Mowlawi Nabi Mohammad, 
chief of his own faction of Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of 
Afghanistan] and Herakat-e Enqelab-e [Islamic Revolution 
Movement], respectively, on Friday [21 Jan] and Saturday [22 
Jan] due to some unknown reasons. 
  The delegation, which comprises Abdol Hadi Arghandwal of 
Hezb-e Eslami, Hashamatollah Mojaddedi, a representative of Prof 
Sebghatollah Mojaddedi's Afghan National Liberation Front, Dr 
Talib of Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party], and Dr Abdol Karim 
Zaray of militia warlord Rashid Dostam's Jonbesh-e Melli Eslami 
[National Movement], Afghanistan, also intends to meet President 
Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to 
convey to them a personal message from Hekmatyar and to inform 
them of the four-party coordination council's stand on the 
fighting in Kabul. 
  Meanwhile, a spokesman for Hezb-e Eslami, Ustad Qaribur 
Rahman Saeed, said that reports appearing in section of the 
Press on Saturday about the destruction caused by bombing in 
Charasyab were exaggerated. 
  Talking to DAWN by telephone, Saeed said that, in fact, the 
Rabbani forces were left with very limited air power after the 
recent bombings and there was no question of their jets hitting 
Charasyab with such severity as was reported. He denied that 
Hezb controlled radio station, Payam-e Azadi, and a TV booster 
were destroyed. "Only a rocket had fallen there which did not 
cause as much damage as was claimed by the enemy," he maintained.

  [Text] A great deal is expected of the draft project, whose 
fate will be decided the day after tomorrow [25 January] when 
its content will be put to the national concord conference. 
Here is Lutfi Charait to talk about this draft project: 
  [Begin Charait recording] The interim period is defined by a 
preliminary project which will be presented the day after 
tomorrow at the national concord conference. The project, after 
having been the subject of a widespread debate, was amended in 
the last few days and presented to the parties to the dialogue. 
  However, what the does the project contain? The draft 
project defines the political, economic, social, and security 
aims. It also provides the basis for allocating powers during 
the interim stage and preparing the conditions and necessary 
laws enabling a return to the electoral track. 
  The project includes 53 articles on allocating powers. The 
general measures confirm that the interim stage will extend to a 
maximum of three years. The constitution remains the legal 
basis for the draft project. 
  The general powers of the state during the interim period 
are 
embodied in the presidency of the state, the government, and the 
provisional national council. 
  The presidency of the state will be composed of a chairman 
and two deputies. The bureau of the conference will recommend 
leaders after consultation between the authority and the parties 
to the dialogue. 
  If the chairman dies or resigns or if the chairman is unable 
to carry out his duties, he will be replaced after consultation 
with the Higher Security Council and the chairman of the 
provisional council. 
  The provisional national council consists of 180 members who 
would be approved by the conference. The government is 
responsible to the provisional council. 
  The project in its new formula calls for the Amezeghian 
dimension to be considered as an essential basis of national 
heritage. In addition, religion cannot be used for partisan 
purposes. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report from the "With the Events" program] </F>
  [Text] An economic delegation led by the governor of the 
U.S. state of Massachusetts met with several Palestinian figures 
today to discuss with the possibility of extending economic 
assistance to the residents of the territories. Our 
correspondent Sa'id Mu'addi has compiled the following report on 
the issue: 
  [Begin recording] [Mu'addi] The U.S. economic delegation 
headed by Massachusetts Governor William Weld met with Faysal 
al-Husayni, economist Dr. Samir 'Abdallah, and Dr. Hazim 
al-Shunnar in east Jerusalem at noon today. The talks addressed 
economic issues, the means of developing the territories 
economically, and possible financial investment by U.S. firms in 
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This delegation is made up of 
representatives from 22 U.S. firms in various areas. 
  At the conclusion of the meeting, Weld said that his visit 
is 
aimed at exploring investment opportunities in the region, 
particularly in the areas of tourism, financial investment, 
infrastructure development, and construction projects, such as 
hotels, communications facilities, and modern technologies. The 
delegation is comprised of representatives from 22 firms, he 
added. Weld noted that these firms are interested in developing 
the territories economically. 
  [Weld, in English] We are looking for opportunities in 
areas, 
such as tourism, such as financial investments, possibly 
construction, either of infrastructure or hotels, 
telecommunications, and information technology. 
  [Mu'addi] During the meeting, no agreements were signed 
between the two sides. Weld said he hoped that the U.S. firms 
will be able to make financial investments in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip. 
  [Weld, in English] We didn't sign any agreement in there. 
But we are hopeful that we will be able to participate in 
investments in the area, in the territories, in the West Bank 
and Gaza. 
  [Mu'addi] During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on 
current issues, particularly the peace process. 
  [Al-Husayni] As the governor has just said, this session of 
talks addressed political issues. Several questions and 
inquiries have been made about economic issues. Consequently, 
the talks were couched in generalities. I believe that it was 
positive. The delegation demonstrated a good understanding of 
the situation in the territories. 
  [Mu'addi] Has the issue of investment in the West Bank and 
Gaza Strip from Massachusetts been raised? 
  [Al-Husayni] Such details have not been discussed. I believe 
that such issues can be discussed in subsequent talks with 
businessmen and firms. 
  [Mu'addi] Since you have recently returned from a visit to 
Saudi Arabia, could you tell us about the outcome of your visit? 
  [Al-Husayni] I believe that the outcome is good and 
positive. 
Undoubtedly, it has helped improve and enhance the ties between 
Saudi Arabia and the PLO. We hope that the visit by brother 
President Yasir 'Arafat to Saudi Arabia will consummate the 
outcome reached during my visit. 
  [Mu'addi] What about Saudi aid to citizens in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip? 
  [Al-Husayni] As a matter of fact, Saudi Arabia has always 
been concerned for aiding the Palestinians. I believe that now 
an opportunity has been created for greater and firmer support 
in light of the current developments we are experiencing, 
particularly with regard to Jerusalem. 
  [Mu'addi] Faysal al-Husayni said he hoped that an agreement 
between the Israelis and Palestinians will be reached, and that 
both sides will embark on the implementation of the joint 
Declaration of Principles in the Gaza-Jericho First accord. 
  [Al-Husayni] We hope that these talks will come to a 
successful conclusion so that we may embark on the 
implementation of the provisions pertaining to the interim 
phase, and so that we may have the opportunity to begin talks on 
the final status. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Sana' 'Atiyah] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Palestinian leaders demanding a more 
democratic decision-making process within the Palestine 
Liberation Organisation (PLO) are preparing for national 
conferences to discuss amending a draft constitution for the 
Palestinian authority in an autonomous West Bank and Gaza Strip, 
Palestinian sources said Wednesday [19 January]. 
  The conferences, due to be held in the occupied territories 
and Amman within two weeks, are expected to draw hundreds of 
Palestinian leaders representing different political factions, 
unions, chambers of industry and commerce in the West Bank and 
Gaza and experts in different fields, according to the sources. 
  The aim of the conferences, according to one of the 
organisers, Taysir 'Aruri, is to hold in-depth discussions on 
the draft constitution and come out with recommendations for 
amendements to be submitted to the PLO leadership. 
  A committee representing the reformists, headed by Haydar 
'Abd-al-Shafi, had discussed the draft constitution with PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat early this month. The reformists 
insisted on "democratising" the decision-making and delegating 
more authority to other Palestinian leaders. During four 
meetings with the PLO chairman, the committee succeeded in 
convincing Mr. 'Arafat that the draft needed amendments. 
  Mr. 'Aruri said that the leadership also agreed to publicise 
the draft, to be implemented during the interim period, and open 
it for discussion before referring it to the 107-member 
Palestine Central Council (PCC). 
  "The aim is to engage in in-depth discussions of the draft 
constitution and recommend the appropriate amendments so that it 
does become a democratic constitution," Mr. 'Aruri told the 
Jordan Times in an interview. 
  He described the document as vague and insisted that 
contradictions existed between the jurisdictions of the chairman 
of the Executive committee, the president of the elected 
Palestinian council in the autonomous areas and the president of 
the executive authority there. 
  "There are too many unclear articles in the constitution 
which need clearing up," Mr. 'Aruri stressed. 
  Another example of contradiction in the draft constitution 
which concerns Palestinian and international human rights 
organisations is in articles 11 and 59. While article 59 
stipulates that "each person has the right to life and the death 
penalty is prohibited," article 11 states that "a death penalty 
will not be carried out except after the president's 
endorsement, and all such sentences will be presented to him by 
the president of the council (government) with a 
recommendation." A footnote adds that "this article will be 
cancelled if the death penalty is cancelled." 
  The reformists--who include members of Mr. 'Arafat's 
mainstream Fatah movement, the Palestine People's Party (PPP) 
and Yasir 'Abd-Rabuh's Democratic Front (FIDA) in addition to 
independent personalities--are seeking to create a Palestinian 
constitution that would guarantee public freedoms and human 
rights. 
  "There must be no text that gives rights to any person or 
body extraordinary jurisidiction to impose exceptions on laws 
that would guarantee human rights," said Mr. 'Aruri, a member of 
the reformist follow-up committee and member of the PPP. 
  He said the reformists would attempt to come up with an 
amended version of the draft document to "guarantee a state of 
law, a modern constitution that would qualify us to enter the 
21st century." 
  The reformist movement, which began with a petititon signed 
by 116 prominent Palestinian personalities, is also seeking to 
become a permanent body that would ensure continued 
democratisation with the PLO leadership. Mr. 'Aruri said that a 
permanent committee will be elected in a secret ballot soon, 
which would act as a body that would work towards "making the 
best of the (Sept. 13) Declaration of Principles (DoP)" between 
the PLO and Israel. 
  He added that much of the movement's activity was taking 
place in the occupied territories, headed by Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, 
and continued to draw more people to its fold. 
  "We are currently involved in intensive contacts with many 
intellectuals and leaders from different factions inside the 
occupied territories and in the diaspora." Mr. 'Aruri said. 
"We are working towards turning what we already have into a 
permanent democratic movement, perhaps a democratic bloc, which 
we expect would become a major pillar in the political 
Palestinian map." 
  The reformists also expect to attract different leaders from 
the opposition factions. such as Hamas and the Popular and 
Democratic fronts, "who do not agree with the unrealistic 
political slogans of torpedoing the peace talks," Mr. 'Aruri 
said, adding that there were such personalities in the 
opposition who seek to "make the DoP work in the best interests 
of the Palestinian people." 
  A number of opposition members were among those who signed 
the petition demanding reform, and a substantial number do not 
share their factions' views on trying to destroy a peaceful 
settlement in the occupied territories.

<F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi] </F>
  [Text] Damascus -- The "leadership committee" in the 
Alliance of Palestinian Forces opposed to the Gaza-Jericho 
agreement began its first meeting yesterday to discuss the basic 
issues deferred when the alliance was announced prior to the 
Syrian-U.S. summit early in the month. 
  Palestinian sources have told AL-HAYAH that the leadership 
committee is discussing four fundamental issues. The sources 
pointed out that the "10 factions" have agreed on political 
tasks, "not a political program, and tasks are less binding on 
participants than a program." The sources added that "after 
strenuous efforts we formed the alliance and determined its 
tasks. We did not discuss the political program question, so 
that no faction will be under a total obligation and so that 
this program will not conflict with its own." 
  On the issues dealt with at the leadership committee 
meeting, 
the sources said that disputed questions include the tasks of 
the popular congresses, the share of every independent faction, 
the position on the phased program for 1974 [as published], and 
the factions' relationship with the National Islamic Command of 
the Intifadah. 
  The Palestinian sources said that "the Islamic Resistance 
Movement (Hamas) stresses that the popular conferences to be 
held inside and outside [the occupied territories] should not be 
granted any organizational capacity and that their role should 
be confined to the political and propagandistic aspects "opposed 
to the Palestinian-Israeli agreement." 
  The sources said that the representation ratio for every 
faction in the leadership committee "has been deferred until 
further notice, because it tends to provoke disagreement among 
the factions more than any other issue. The same applied to the 
position on the international resolutions." 
  The sources said that Hamas representatives reject these 
resolutions and do not comply with them or with the phased 
Palestinian program. And that they believe that this program 
"is being used by (Palestinian President Yasir) 'Arafat as a 
cover for all he is doing now, on the basis of the status quo 
policy."

  [Text] In a session today, the National Assembly's Arab and 
International Relations Committee hosted Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf. The minister gave a briefing on Iraqi 
policy concerning relations with neighboring Arab countries and 
the latest political developments concerning the unjust blockade 
imposed on the Iraqi people. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf explained that thanks to the 
instructions of leader President Saddam Husayn, the Iraqi policy 
has yielded good results at the current stage, especially with 
respect to the change in the policies of some international 
powers. He hoped that the next stage will witness more positive 
developments in terms of understanding the nature of the 
existing conflict in the region in a manner that will contribute 
to bolstering regional security, stability, and prosperity, and 
to countering the challenges posed to the region's peoples.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin left this morning for 
Strasbourg, where he is to address the European Parliament. 
Before leaving, Rabin held consultations with Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres in preparation for Peres' meeting with PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Davos, Switzerland. 
  The discussion was long and detailed, and was attended by 
Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur, IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] generals, and Environment Minister Yosi Sarid, who will 
accompany Peres in Davos. It was stressed that Israel would 
retain control of the external crossing points; there would be 
no PLO presence on the Jordan bridges. At the terminals, Israel 
would retain the right to check any person or object that gave 
grounds for suspicion; however, every effort would be made to 
make Israeli control of the terminal less visible.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 24 Jan (MENA)--Two Palestinian officials 
have attributed the postponement of tomorrow's meetings of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Security Affairs Committee until next week 
to the ongoing political efforts to eliminate the obstacles to 
the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chairman of the Palestinian delegation to 
the Taba talks, has stated that the Palestinian delegation was 
forced to postpone the talks to make room for the political 
efforts to eliminate the obstacles. 
  In a statement to MENA today, Sha'th commended the role that 
President Mubarak is playing to eliminate the obstacles and 
boost the peace effort. He remarked that Foreign Minister 'Amr 
Musa's visit to Israel and his talks with Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres were within the context 
of Egyptian efforts to eliminate the obstacles. He explained 
that Musa carried to Israel a Palestinian paper outlining the 
Palestinian vision of how to resolve outstanding issues. He 
hoped Israel would respond positively in this connection. 
  Sha'th added that Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat would 
return to Cairo tomorrow to meet President Mubarak and 'Amr Musa 
and discuss the Israeli reply, which Musa brought back with him.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Ahmad </F>
Al Khalifah by Bari'ah 'Alam-al-Din in London "yesterday"] 
  [Text] ['Alam-al-Din] What are the most important aims of 
your current visit to Britain? What issues have you discussed 
with officials in London, and what are the aims of your visit to 
the United States, which begins tomorrow? 
  [Al Khalifah] Actually my current visit to London is a 
regular working visit organized between us and the British 
Defense Ministry. The meetings held yesterday, Monday, with 
Jonathan Aitken, minister of state for defense procurements, and 
then Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind are regular meetings 
which occur once a year in Bahrain or in London. 
  And as I said, these are regular visits and meetings which 
do 
not lead to "military deals," as you journalists like to portray 
them. Even if they do lead to deals and agreements, we military 
officials are known for saying little. 
  ['Alam-al-Din] So what can be said about the results of the 
meetings held yesterday? 
  [Al Khalifah] A memorandum of understanding was signed 
yesterday between us and them to organize joint exercises and 
cooperation in the exchange of military personnel between the 
two states. 
  ['Alam-al-Din] Does your visit to the United States tomorrow 
(today) fall within the same framework as your visit to Britain? 
  [Al Khalifah] The visit to the United States is similar to 
the visit to Britain. It is aimed at organizing joint 
cooperation between the United States and Bahrain. 
  ['Alam-al-Din] Can Bahrain's cooperation with the United 
States and Britain be put in a single framework? 
  [Al Khalifah] Our cooperation with Britain is older. 
However, our dealings with the two states are conducted on the 
same level. They are two major states and each has its 
influential role in the security of the region, the Gulf region. 
  ['Alam-al-Din] How would you assess the results of the Gulf 
Cooperation Council [GCC] summit held in Riyadh last month with 
regard to Gulf security? 
  [Al Khalifah] The summit and its results were a success at 
the military level, as the leaders endorsed all the defense 
ministers' recommendations without any omissions, amendments, or 
reservations--proof of complete success. 
  ['Alam-al-Din] What stage has been reached in the plan to 
build and develop the "Peninsula Shield Force"? 
  [Al Khalifah] There is a reorganization process under way to 
reinforce the Peninsula Shield Force on the basis of the 
recommendations I mentioned. 
  ['Alam-al-Din] Some people are calling for a limit to the 
Gulf states' spending on armament, saying that the weapons they 
are buying exceed their capability. What is your opinion? 
  [Al Khalifah] I can talk about the State of Bahrain in 
detail and about my brothers in the GCC states generally and say 
that we are newly independent states, and it is obviously a 
national duty to build up our armed forces. Every citizen 
should participate in performing this duty in order to defend 
the homeland. And any efforts made in that direction -- in an 
organized manner -- are bound to to lead to the desired results. 
  I do not believe that the Gulf states are arming themselves 
beyond their security needs. On the contrary, they need every 
item of armament purchased in order to confront the dangers 
surrounding them, which far exceed their armament programs. 
  ['Alam-al-Din] How do you view the situation of the 
Bahrain Armed Forces? And are you satisfied with their position? 
  [Al Khalifah] Defense in Bahrain -- under the supervision of 
their highnesses the head of state, the heir apparent, and the 
prime minister -- has the lion's share in the modest general 
budget. 
  And praise be to God, we have -- with our own capabilities 
and the help of our brothers in the GCC states -- achieved the 
basic structure with regard to the establishment of Bahrain's 
defense force in terms of the three corps: ground forces, air 
force, and navy. That is, in a manner sufficient to defend 
Bahrain against any threat. 
  There is a need for further capabilities whose achievement I 
am discussing with the British and U.S. Governments. 
  ['Alam-al-Din] When will the Gulf possess a joint military 
force capable of repulsing any foreign aggression against any 
GCC state, even at the initial stage of this aggression? 
  [Al Khalifah] Some people always say that the work of the 
GCC defense ministers is characterized by slowness. To this we 
can respond that, if we study NATO's history, we will find that 
it took its defense ministers decades to assemble and unite its 
forces after World War II. And there are European states which 
still have not joined NATO. And there are states which have 
joined it in a semiofficial way, like France, which is not a 
proper member, even though it has to fulfill certain NATO 
commitments for geopolitical reasons. 
  Thus I believe that the steps we have taken with regard to 
building systems, laws, and military arrangements in the Gulf 
are effective and fundamental. So it can be said that all this 
will lead to the uniting of the military forces. And the 
Peninsula Shield Force is the basic nucleus for joint and 
unified military cooperation. 
  ['Alam-al-Din] Some people in the West expect World War III 
to break out in the Gulf region within the next five years. Do 
you believe this expectation to be correct, and, if so, how can 
it be tackled? 
  [Al Khalifah] That saying proves that preparedness for war 
is the best means to prevent the breakout of war. This is 
because any enemy who sees that the person he is planning to 
attack is preparing to defend himself is bound to reexamine his 
calculations, and vice versa. 
  We hope that the page of wars will be turned, that peace 
will 
prevail, and that the peoples will enjoy stability. What we 
have suffered from the two recent wars is enough. 
  ['Alam-al-Din] Why has talk about the establishment of an 
Arab military industry stopped? 
  [Al Khalifah] Maybe money and material capabilities are the 
first reason for the faltering of military industrialization in 
some Arab states, such as Egypt. 
  As for the GCC states, there is still interest in military 
industrialization, and the issue is on the negotiating table. 
There is a nucleus for military industrialization in the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia. It will develop with the passage of time. 
  ['Alam-al-Din] How is peace expected to affect regional 
security in the Middle East? 
  [Al Khalifah] As is known, Israel is a state which is not 
comfortable under peace, by virtue of its political structure 
and as a group of individuals gathered in our region from 
various parts of the world. This is why they want to continue 
the occupation atmosphere in Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and 
Jordan and at the same time to seize the economic initiative 
from us and to invade our countries economically just as they 
have invaded them militarily and in human terms. 
  We hope that Israel has now decided to be serious in the 
framework of the peace process. We also hope that they have 
discovered that they have no life except within the framework of 
a comprehensive and just peace. We in the Gulf states leave the 
Palestinians to make their own decisions, and we support 
everything they have decided for themselves. We also support 
the peace process and believe as military officials that there 
can be no peace as long as the enemy continues to occupy our 
Arab territories. 
  ['Alam-al-Din] What about other threats? 
  [Al Khalifah] As long as the Gulf region contains 65 percent 
of world oil reserves, the threats to it will continue to exist. 
What sort of peace or security can be established when Israel 
has more than 200 nuclear bombs in its military arsenal. 
  When you ponder this reality your confidence in peace is 
bound to waver. However, we hope that the endeavors being made 
will secure just solutions, strip Israel of its nuclear weapons, 
and eliminate this type of vile and destructive weapon from our 
region as a whole.

cultural problems of the country were discussed during the joint 
session of the cabinet and Majles deputies, which was held last 
night in the presence of President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  Our correspondent reports that during this session, 
President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani expressed satisfaction on the formation of 
the joint cabinet-Majles deputies' session and underlined the 
need for coordination and the exchange of expert information 
between the legislative and executive branches before debates on 
the state budget at the Majles open session. 
  The president said that the government's economic policies 
conform to the wishes and directives of the esteemed leader. 
Stressing the need to implement these policies to achieve 
development and progress and end the budget's dependence on oil 
income, he stated: During the first Five-Year Plan, many of the 
country's serious problems were solved, and with the full 
support of the esteemed leader, the Majles, and the clergymen, 
and with the extensive presence of the patient and resistant 
people of the country who have always displayed their political 
and social maturity in the various aspects of the Islamic 
revolution, during the Second Five-Year Plan steps will be taken 
toward economic progress and decreasing the people's welfare 
problems. 
  During the session, which was held at the president's 
office, 
Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri also described the joint session of 
officials from the executive and legislative branches as 
significant because joint efforts and collective exchanges of 
views on the country's current and future problems are useful 
and significant. Listing the activities of the various Majles 
commissions during the reconstruction era, he stressed the 
Majles deputies' support for the views and directives of the 
founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, His Eminence Imam 
Khomeyni, may his soul be sanctified, and of the esteemed leader. 
  During the session, several Majles deputies also spoke about 
political, economic, social, and cultural issues.

  [Text] LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] watchers in 
Colombo were yesterday convinced that the recent fire bombing of 
the Tiger Organization's Eela Nadu office in Paris was an overt 
signal to Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran to desist from 
carrying out the execution of his one time deputy Gopalaswamy 
Mahendraraja alias Mahattaya earlier scheduled yesterday. 
Mahattaya and around 120 of his followers including Dilip Yogi 
were to face execution yesterday on the orders of Prabhakaran. 
This date was confirmed [words indistinct] LTTE's coordinating 
committee in Paris headed by Lawrence Thilakar and the Sri 
Lanka's high commission in London received written confirmation 
of the impending executions. 
  Meanwhile, reports reaching Colombo say that Tamil residents 
abroad were supporting Mahattaya and Yogi and made every effort 
to prevent their execution including bringing it to the notice 
of the Human Rights Commission as well as with foreign 
governments so that pressure could be exerted on the LTTE in 
this regard. There has been several repeated, but yet 
unconfirmed reports that Mahattaya has already been executed. 
Other reports place the date of execution as January 16 believed 
by analysts to be a congenial day because it is Mahattaya's 
birthday and the first anniversary of the Indian Navy's 
interception of the LTTE's ammunition ship in which incident 
Sadasivam Krishnakumar, alias Kittu, was reported to have 
committed suicide in January last year. 
  Eighteen LTTE frontliners who participated in the attack on 
Pooneryn camp complex including (Kartik) and (Kaushalia) have 
surrendered to the Police Special Task Force. Military sources 
said that they decided to surrender as a protest against 
Prabhakaran's decision to execute several LTTE leaders including 
Mahattaya and Yogi. They have also decided to cooperate with the 
government in elections to the local bodies in the East and have 
expressed their gratitude to the government for its concern over 
[word indistinct]. (Kartik) was in charge of the operation in 
which 23 soldiers of the Mandewa camp was killed [words 
indistinct]. (Kaushalia) was in charge of training youth Tigers.

<F P=106> [Article by Talal Salman--quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] The watch is Swiss, the time is Arabic, and the era 
is American. The watch controls the dates and commits the two 
presidents from two different worlds and two different eras to 
succeed. Like enmity, failure does not need a summit meeting. 
It could lead to inability or to a lack of desire to reach the 
summit. Or perhaps it could lead to an attempt to unilaterally 
control the plain, the slope, the mountain, and the summit 
together. 
  At 1000 (Swiss time) of that depressing European Sunday, 16 
January 1993, they stood at two of the three doors of the UN 
hall that had so often witnessed meetings between adversaries 
seeking an unavoidable agreement. U.S. President Bill Clinton 
stood at "his door" for a minute or two, awaiting his "partner" 
in the meeting, his eyes full of curiosity to finally see the 
"shrewd" man about whom he had heard and read a lot. 
  Who would make the first step and move toward the other? 
Formalities seem basic in some cases. However, the "symbol of 
change" in this "American century"--a term used by his 
predecessor George Bush, who won wars and lost the 
presidency--did not stop for long at this point of etiquette. 
When he started to walk, he noticed that the "shrewd" man was 
ahead of him in the first step toward the "third era" and the 
world of the common language. They moved forward with a bit of 
caution. They met, according to protocol, in the middle of the 
space, the middle of the hall, the middle of the road between 
reality and hope, between today and tomorrow in its assumed 
image. They shook hands, each one pressing the right hand of 
the other. The handshake took a long time, to enable those who 
could not see well to see and those who wanted to adjust the 
lenses of their cameras to photograph the event. They were also 
trying to break the ice of the first meeting between those 
coming to it from equal distances. 
  In matters of courtesy, the man from the "East" always 
excels. Thus, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad asked the first 
question that deviated from the prepared text. The question was 
about Clinton's long, multi-segmented journey to the world of 
the old enemy, namely the "socialist camp under the great Soviet 
Union." 
  This was the proper prelude to starting the "original" talk 
after the photographers, journalists, and the members of the two 
delegations had left, surrounded by multinational, multilingual, 
and multi-labelled security men and those whose curiosity 
overwhelmed their self-respect and who sought to see "that 
moment" even though they were not among the invitees. 
  On the two sides of the old wooden table in the big hall, 
only six men remained: the President, his secretary of state, 
his adviser for national security, and two interpreters in the 
background. [sentence as published] 
  From what point could the trip begin, and how could it end 
when its map had no points of reference? 
  From international to regional to bilateral topics and back 
again. It was as if the talk were taking place inside 
cylinders, where borders could not be drawn between topics that 
intertwine and intermix so that it was impossible to 
differentiate between topics on the basis of their priority. 
There was no "secondary" topic in such a meeting, the topic of 
which was the Arab-Israeli conflict. The region, which was Arab, 
will remain Arab even if its name is changed and the 
geographical term of the others is used instead of the identity 
of its Arab people. Such a name change is also used by those 
who have supposedly absolved themselves of this region and 
joined the future--the new world order. 
  There is no common ground, either in geography or in 
history. Where then would you put the other man; compare him to 
the color of your eyes or the darkness of your complexion? 
  The battle for existence is infinite. Peace is just another 
stop or a new page. But "the book" is too big to be summed up 
or abridged. It is harder still to write the ending. 
  The Arab region has no "localities;" it is at the core of 
the 
world. For centuries it was the heart of the world. It might 
not be its head anymore, but it still occupies its heart. It is 
"the small celestial body that contains the greater world in its 
folds." 
  How can the inheritor of the land of all religions, 
messages, 
and prophets forget its name, descent, and the heritage the 
earth has kept: Is there a single location, city, mountain, or 
river that has not forced itself into one of the three holy 
books and taken a place of prominence? 
  Where does Washington stand compared to Damascus, Jerusalem, 
Nazareth, Bethlehem, Mecca, Medina, or Baghdad? That is, if we 
forget Tyre, Sidon, Jubayl, Ugarit, Ra's Shamrah, and Babylon 
and Nineveh and Thebes before them or with them. 
  We have to admit that the Arab region is no longer "the 
world" or the "center of the world." However, we cannot forget 
that throughout its history it was the heart of the world, the 
ambition of the world, or the one-way road between "the center" 
and the world. Not only did it give the world its three holy 
religions, but it also made some of its empires, many of its 
civilizations, and the memories that the computer is now 
swallowing and almost wiping out. 
  But the world cannot live without memories, particularly in 
a 
region blazing with a conflict, most of whose roots go back, 
whether truly or falsely, in history. The old religious legend 
is being employed in the service of the newly made political 
interests. 
  Had Bill Clinton been "an ordinary American," Hafiz 
al-Asad's 
task would have been much harder: What is the common ground 
between a born "politician" and "ideologist"--in whose memory 
history lies, provides his dreams and hopes, and controls much 
of the shape, objectives, and slogans of his policies--and that 
smart-looking young American man who is fond of playing the 
saxophone? 
  But Bill Clinton is a graduate of Oxford. Europe inherited 
the world from the Arabs through the Turks. In Europe in the 
1970's, Clinton became "a politician" and was infected with the 
germ of history. Politics lies in history; it begins and ends 
in history and, drawing strength from it, rejuvenates both 
itself and history. 
  How seemingly far apart are these two men, who sit opposite 
each other now to reach an agreement? Each comes from a past so 
different from the other that they contradict. One was forced 
to take up war as a profession to protect his land, people, and 
role, while the other resisted war and demonstrated against it 
to attain similar goals in his country. 
  The war veteran is now facing the former fighter against 
war. 
  The first fought for survival and the second fought against 
war to survive. 
  The first went to wars that were imposed on him many times 
and where he had no choice in the matter, except once, and no 
freedom to specify the place, time, or weapons used, even though 
other parties controlled the results of these wars in 
anticipation of another unjust war that was going to be imposed 
on him. 
  The second one took it upon himself to prevent an unjust war 
his country was waging against others under the pretext of 
national security and providing progress and security for 
humanity. The results of this war backfired. Now, from his 
position as president, he is trying to present an image of the 
beautiful American as an alternative to the disgusting picture 
of the ugly American that has mobilized all peoples against the 
strong heir--teeming with righteousness and potential--of the 
old and worn out colonizer who has retired and become obsolete. 
  The wound does not need any rhetoric, but the wounded man is 
not silent. He voices his pain. Thus, President al-Asad did 
not disappoint Clinton's expectations. He had to review the 
bloody chapters of the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict. He 
also paused a long time before the bitter experiences of the 
attempt to re-establish an equal relationship with the United 
States throughout the past quarter of a century. 
  He had to say everything all at once. He had to review the 
nature of the struggle and its history, while concentrating on 
and always reiterating the role this conflict has had in the 
relationship of the Arabs with the West in general, and the 
United States in particular. However, at certain times, he had 
to speak in professorial tones and to explain and recount the 
facts in great detail while relying heavily on many things he 
had heard from Clinton's predecessors, Nixon, Carter, and Bush 
(with talk in the third person about Ronald Reagan, whom he did 
not know personally, although he knew a great deal about him and 
heard from him expressions conveyed by a series of 
envoys--expressions that neither please nor ease the mind). 
  Clinton learned from al-Asad what he did not know and what 
he 
did not intend to happen. This is why he not only asked not to 
be judged according to the mistakes of other U.S. officials, in 
particular Henry Kissinger, Philip Habib, George Schultz, and 
before him Alexander Haig. He admitted publicly that "he 
learned and understood the meaning of peace as President al-Asad 
wants it." He began to understand the sensitivity in the 
relations between the Arabs, who have entered the struggle with 
Israel, and Israel, regardless of the political differences 
between their regimes which create borders between their 
"states" and "public" stances. 
  [Al-Asad] "I make no distinction between the Golan Heights 
and southern Lebanon, and between the occupied parts of 
Palestine or Jordan. The issue is not like a man who has 
preferences, and prefers one of his many wives over the others. 
To me, it is one Arab land and no part of it is more valuable 
than the other. What I demand for one part, I demand for all 
parts. This is essential. It is all one territory for one 
nation. This fact reveals the secret behind the inability of 
unilateral solutions or peace treaties to terminate the historic 
struggle between the Israelis and the Arabs. This is why we 
insist on just, comprehensive, and permanent peace. Peace is not 
peace unless it is comprehensive. Before you, there have been 
three experiments that did not succeed in making peace and did 
not end the struggle: Camp David 1978 with Egypt under 
al-Sadat; 17 May 1983 with Lebanon under Amin al-Jumayyil; and 
the Gaza-Jericho agreement with Yasir 'Arafat on 13 September 
1993. 
  "This is enough to show that separate solutions, no matter 
how many there are, cannot make peace. It could be in Israel's 
interest to exploit moments of weakness by some Arab officials 
to grab their signatures on agreements that might never see the 
light of day. But what interest does a great country like yours 
have in being biased and being a party to this conflict, knowing 
that this would make your country lose its role as an 
international authority, honest broker, and a full partner in 
the making of peace? 
  "It would not be peace if it were imposed through coercion 
and force. It would only be a humiliating agreement if it is 
dictated by an occupier who is proud of his victory which cannot 
last forever. Likewise, the defeat of the vanquished cannot 
last forever, particularly since he is the owner of the land. 
He was born on this land and was not brought to it from abroad. 
His connection with this land is permanent and firm. He does 
not forget this land and he will never be forgotten by it. It 
belongs to him and he belongs to it. There is no other 
alternative. He was not brought to this land from another 
history or from other places. He was born on this land and he 
will continue to adhere to it. He got his name from his land 
and the land got its name from the Arabs." 
  Perhaps this prompted Clinton to say in his statement and 
then in his answers to the numerous journalists' questions that 
he "had learned from President al-Asad." He humbly backed down 
on the old "golden" description of the Jericho agreement, which 
is only "a first step for laying the foundation for solving the 
problem." 
  Therefore, it is not possible to have separate solutions or 
to use the Gaza-Jericho accord as if it were the happy ending of 
a movie with many actors and full of battlefields like the 
Arab-Israeli conflict. 
  It was the conflict that opened the road for the Soviet 
Union. Washington was the hope, but it withdrew from its role. 
The Soviets seized the opportunity and departed from their 
position, which initially supported the creation of Israel, and 
drew closer to the Arabs to the extent of participating with 
them in confronting the alliance that had been forged between 
Tel Aviv, which believes in the Torah, and secular Washington, 
which defends democracy and human rights. 
  Realizing this fact must yield fruits so that it will be 
possible to establish new relations between Syria's al-Asad and 
the United States in "the new era," the era of changes and a 
quest for certainty, the era of the one power and its new world 
order, the era of Bill Clinton. 
  But rectification is necessary to avoid the recurrence of 
the 
historical mistakes: 
  "We want to have good relations with you. But this cannot be 
started if the desire and decision is made by one side. Such 
good relations can only be made by a joint decision from the two 
sides. We do not try to sell to you or buy from you a used car 
that becomes idle and obstinate rather than moving forward. We 
want good relations that are not governed by accusations over 
suspicions, or by those who want our misunderstandings to 
continue to influence your decision. Accusing us of sponsoring 
terrorism and putting our name on the list of terrorist states 
is only an attempt to terrorize you and govern your foreign 
relations. We are absolutely not your enemies, and we want you 
not to look at us as your enemies. Our behavior toward you has 
been governed by our reaction to the decisions made by your 
previous administrations. 
  "As much as the Americans are optimistic about your 
commitment to change, we hope that the change will include your 
stand on the Arab-Israeli conflict in general, and on us in 
particular. You seek peace, which is what we demand. Anyone who 
has suffered the bitterness of war and the agony of sacrifice 
appreciates the value of peace, but peace requires two parties. 
  We went to Madrid with your guarantee and under your 
sponsorship, together with the Soviets who later became 
Russians, with the hope that the Israelis would respond to this 
call for the peace of the brave. But peace did not materialize 
and Shamir tried to wreck the process by adopting extremism, 
which undermined the conference. Here Rabin is trying to abort 
the attempt to establish a comprehensive and just peace by 
luring the PLO leadership into a vague agreement, which, in our 
view, compromises and stalls the peace process. A sound 
solution cannot be achieved in secret with the exclusion and at 
the expense of other parties. 
  There can be no peace in Palestine or peace for the Israelis 
if Israelis continue to occupy part of Syrian national soil, 
part of Lebanese national soil, and part of Jordanian national 
soil, not to mention the Palestinian land they occupy. 
  "The role of the United States as a full partner and 
impartial mediator is fundamental and dominant, but a separate 
agreement annuls this role. You ascertained by yourselves that 
the dazzling ceremony, in which everyone was requested to 
participate, does not end a conflict that filled pages in the 
past and does not guarantee a future that provides new 
generations with hope for a better tomorrow. 
  "What is the problem between Syria and you? "We often hear 
the Americans talk about the links of Arabs, in general, and 
Syria, in particular, to terrorism or to terrorist groups. Who 
said the work to liberate the occupied land can be called 
terrorism? If this were true, the American Revolution could be 
regarded as terrorism. Didn't you fight those you considered 
occupiers and colonialists? Were George Washington and his 
comrades terrorists? 
  "Frankly, we can say that much of our behavior was a 
reaction. We suffered occupation and aggression and our dignity 
was humiliated, and we reacted. Why then should the cause be 
ignored and the outcome be put on trial? 
  "Do you want the peace process to succeed? Peace is our 
demand but are the Israelis ready? You know the answer better 
than we do. What we know and feel and what is happening on the 
ground is not reassuring. Your role is necessary as a guarantee 
for us and for them. You must assert your commitment to this 
role, which made us go to Madrid. We then were surprised by the 
Israelis carving their way to Oslo behind our backs. But where 
is Washington? 
  There is nothing wrong with citing incidents from personal 
history to deduce points that could strengthen the principled 
stand. 
  It is an opportunity to drop that accusation that has stuck 
to the name and almost become a part of it. 
  "I believe we can reach some agreement on defining and 
describing terrorism. Your starting point at the summit stems 
from your known position on the Vietnam war. You rejected 
'military service' and dodged the draft. You then marched in 
demonstrations against the U.S. role in Vietnam. You reached 
the climax in defying your government and traveled to Moscow, 
the capital of the evil empire, as it was called later by U.S. 
President Ronald Reagan. In Moscow, you publicized your 
position with no thought as to the repercussions. 
  It is a glorious position and you deserve to be saluted for 
it. 
  However, let me ask you the following: Did you, at that 
time, consider the Vietcong fighters terrorists? Not at all. 
You used to view what the U.S. Army was doing as an unjust war, 
if we wish to avoid the word terrorism. 
  "By the same logic, how could the Palestinian youth fighting 
against the Israeli occupation army to liberate his land be 
described as a terrorist? He is a fighter and not a terrorist. 
Who has the guts to accuse the youth who is fighting the 
Israeli occupier to defend his house and life in southern 
Lebanon, whether he belongs to Hizballah or any other Lebanese 
resistance organizations, of being a terrorist. Whoever resists 
the occupier in his land, whether Syrian or Jordanian, is a 
fighter against terrorism and cannot be categorized as a 
terrorist. Whoever helps these people cannot accept being 
accused of harboring terrorism. In fact, we need to raise the 
question why international legitimacy and the superpowers, who 
have a special responsibility toward peace in the world, do not 
intervene to stop the oppressors in their tracks. 
  "We are victims of terrorism, and it is natural for victims 
to unite so long as the terrorism of the strong continues." 
  It is not important whether the young President was 
convinced 
or not. What is important is to pinpoint the situation and 
present the real picture. 
  In one of his answers to questions by journalists after the 
meeting, the young President referred to the issue that was a 
point of dispute. He said discussions over this issue lasted 
about an hour "without our attempting to solve it now." Thus, 
they left this issue up to the deliberations of the joint 
committee that was formed comprising the foreign ministers of 
the two countries, as part of other issues that need to be 
looked into and agreed upon. Otherwise, each side would have to 
accept the stand of the other without blackmail, sanctions, or 
international slander. 
  Authorization with regard to the Lebanese issue is absolute 
on both the official and realistic levels. However, Hafiz 
al-Asad is accurate and reserved in his use of this direct 
authorization. National logic helps here as in any other 
proposed topic. Facts, in their entirety, are results of the 
original struggle, including Resolution 425. This is why he 
listed it directly after the other two--Resolutions 242 and 
338--which have to do with the Israeli occupation of other Arab 
territories. He linked them all to the land-for-peace and 
Madrid formulas to reach an acceptable settlement. 
  The strength of the presentation by President al-Asad was 
apparent in the conclusion the U.S. President reached after he 
made a naive response to a question about Lebanon. Clinton cut 
short his response to another question and said that one of his 
aides had drawn his attention to the ambiguity of his response 
to a previous question on Lebanon, a response that could have 
insulted the Syrian president. He then went on to explain that 
response. 
  The subject of Lebanon was prominent in the talks, it was 
discussed as a full party in the peace process and as a state 
with sovereignty, independence, and a political formula, which 
was developed during the al-Ta'if conference. The subject of 
Lebanon was prominent when they discussed the resistance and a 
just, comprehensive, and permanent peace. 
  President al-Asad introduced the subject of Lebanon by 
explaining the nature of the relations between the "one people 
in two states" and how they share a joint fate, which is 
apparent in the Brotherhood, Coordination, and Cooperation 
Treaty. This is a treaty that ensures the joint interests and 
benefits of the two countries through their two "states." It 
does not have anything to do with emotions or the desire to 
impose hegemony and control. 
  The subject of Lebanon had to be prominent when the 
discussion turned to the "fiery introduction" to the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, namely Israel's "invasion with fire" 
waged against south Lebanon. Later on it was learned that this 
invasion was carried out to divert attention from what was 
happening in Washington. 
  That was an excellent opportunity to confirm that anything 
but a unilateral solution would be at the expense of the other 
parties in the struggle. The results of this struggle have 
affected everyone and everyone needs to participate in 
formulating an acceptable political settlement. 
  Note: Before the joint news conference, U.S. Ambassador to 
Damascus Christopher Ross approached me and inspected the 
journalists' identity card pinned on my chest. The card 
informed everyone that I was a member of the Syrian delegation. 
He read my name in a tone of someone who had just discovered a 
military secret. He then tried to play down the whole issue with 
a personal joke, but my answer was natural: But your president 
is in there talking about all of Lebanon, present and future, 
with President al-Asad. 
  The veteran diplomat said: Do not misunderstand me. I am 
not protesting. I am merely trying to link the concept to the 
actual picture. 
  During the news conference, and after the numerous 
references 
in the U.S. President's answers to Lebanon and Syria's role 
there--in fact, his references to Syria's key role in the region 
and its peace--I turned around looking for Ambassador Ross. He 
met my eye with a wide smile and a nod of the head indicating 
agreement on what we had not disagreed about in the first place. 
  President al-Asad did not waste the opportunity. Washington 
is an essential party and the objective is to receive guarantees 
that its President is unbiased. There are no delusions that 
Clinton will be biased toward us. The important thing is for 
Arab logic to be heard fully, clearly, frankly, and directly. 
The important thing is for us to shake his former confidence 
and to force him to search for a balance that clears him from 
absolute bias toward Israeli logic, which imposes its hegemony 
on the area around it. 
  It is Hafiz al-Asad's school of political strategy. You 
should know the person you are talking to very well and let him 
know you. In order to let him to know you, it is not wrong for 
you to explain your stance using history, personal accounts, 
experiences of others, and your experiences with others. 
  Hafiz al-Asad knows how to present himself; not as a master 
but as a highly experienced adviser. He managed to use language 
that a man like Bill Clinton understands. The impact was clear 
from the young president's conduct and statements when both men 
addressed journalists. Clinton used phrases that he had just 
heard from the "wise man" who extended a hand of friendship from 
the world's oldest capital. 
  Bill Clinton is preparing himself to be the image of the 
future: He is handsome, tall, young, and has a vision and an 
ambition to make history. And history's widest door is in the 
east, and the strongest and most prominent man holding the keys 
to the east is Hafiz al-Asad, the man with whom the U.S. 
President sat for four hours and 20 minutes and still wanted 
more. They sat again for an hour or more, upsetting the travel 
schedule and increasing tension in the worried city of Tel Aviv. 
  Bill Clinton was an embodiment of the new land. But, he 
found out that his interlocutor is not in the past, he is in the 
present. The Israelis cannot be in the past, present, and future 
at the same time. 
  No one, alone, can be the world. 
  Hafiz al-Asad succeeded in bringing Damascus closer to 
Washington and vice versa, and in making Clinton's ambition the 
driving force in the peace talks with Israel. He removed most 
of the mines on the road between the two capitals and wrested 
recognition of his decisive future role. He is not like the 
others, and none of those who signed or were invited to sign 
tomorrow is like him. He is the closest to the image of the 
true "Arab." Leaning on this strong position, he speaks, 
changes contexts, and helps set priorities straight. 
  From now on, it is going to be Clinton's battle with the 
Israelis. The battle actually started in the plane that flew 
Clinton back to Washington, as we were told by some White House 
journalists. But the actual battleground will be in Israel 
itself. What happened in Geneva is too serious for Israel to 
accept and too solid for it to reject or cancel. 
  The next few days will show the seriousness of what happened 
in the too quiet Swiss city. Geneva's history may record that 
the city witnessed the most important step on the road toward a 
settlement of the long, bloody conflict between the Arabs and 
the Israelis, and that Hafiz al-Asad succeeded in shaking 
Israel's constants, which had overwhelmed Bill Clinton's memory 
and had guided his political movement. 
  This is another long and bitter battle, but it is not 
"against" the Israelis and Americans at the same time. It is 
being launched to clarify the border between the two so that 
peace can be established in the "taboo land," which might have 
room for the Arabs in the future. 
  When my Syrian colleagues at the press conference gave me 
the opportunity to ask my question, which was filled with 
criticism of the U.S. President, I knew that I would not get a 
serious answer. But the important thing was to pose the 
question: 
  "The United States says that it supports a comprehensive 
solution and a just peace. But its policy on the issue of the 
Arab-Israeli conflict has been at times ambiguous and almost 
biased. It has sponsored and is sponsoring all the unilateral 
agreements, the last of which was the Gaza-Jericho agreement, 
which you personally sponsored at an international celebration 
held at the White House. 
  "Before that, there was the bitter experience of Lebanon in 
the 17 May (1983) agreement. 
  "The United States used force in the war against Iraq but 
has 
refrained from extending enough support for the international 
resolutions that concern the Arabs, including Resolution 425 on 
the Israeli occupation of some Lebanese territories, the 
resolution on the [Palestinian] deportees, and all the other 
resolutions on Palestine. 
  "In light of the summit talks, how can you explain all 
this?" 
  President Clinton overlooked the substance of the question 
and was content with a general and ambiguous answer. But his 
answer included a clear signal, when he said: "I believe that 
all the parties in this process recognize that peace cannot be 
achieved unless we can bring all the tracks together and make 
them successful. President al-Asad spoke very skillfully today 
during our meeting. He spoke about the situation in Lebanon and 
Jordan. He said that even if the problems with Israel are 
resolved separately, this should still be part of a 
comprehensive solution and all the problems between Israel and 
its neighbors--Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria--must be solved." 
  Of course, I was not expecting Clinton to criticize the 
overall U.S. policy toward the Arabs or to point out the fact 
that the U.S. Administration has double standards when it comes 
to justice and to the implementation of international 
resolutions and that it does not always fulfill its pledges. 
  I thank those in Geneva who gave me some of their time 
(since 
each press delegation could only ask three questions). I also 
thank those in Beirut who have said that we do not belong to 
Lebanon and that our media do not belong to the Arabs with Syria 
at their heart.

  [Text] Kathmandu, Jan 20 (AFP) -- Visiting Japanese Foreign 
Affairs Vice Minister Shozo Azuma met with Nepalese Prime 
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala for an hour of bilateral talks 
Thursday, a foreign ministry source said. 
  Koirala and Azuma also discussed Japan's Asia-Pacific 
regional policy, the source added. 
  The vice minister, who arrived here early Thursday, signed 
two separate agreements to assist in improving facilities at 
Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport and the construction 
of the Tripureswore-Bagmati bridge. 
  The existing bridge was built with help from India, but has 
been weakened by heavy traffic. 
  The Japanese official also had an audience with King 
Birendra 
late Thursday at the royal palace. 
  A Japanese Embassy spokesman said the main purpose of 
Azuma's 
visit was to promote goodwill and mutual understanding and 
strengthen relations between the two countries. 
  Azuma is scheduled to leave Friday after attending the 
inauguration of another bridge here, which Japan also assisted 
in building. 
  He is to make stops in India and Pakistan at the weekend 
before returning to Japan.

  [Text] Nouakchott, 20 Jan (AFP) -- Mauritanian security 
forces have arrested an undisclosed number of people for fraud a 
week ahead of local government elections in the West African 
country, the Interior Ministry said Thursday [20 January]. 
Those arrested came from both the ruling Democratic and Social 
Republican Party (PRDS) and opposition groupings and will be 
charged for making use of forged identity papers to enable 
people to vote twice, the ministry said. Such fraud undermined 
the "rigorous procedures" employed in drawing up the voters' 
rolls and indelible ink will be used during the January 28 
elections to prevent double-voting, a ministry statement added. 
  Two parties are taking on the PRDS, which is presenting 189 
lists of candidates at the polls. The main opposition Union of 
Democratic Forces (UFD) is presenting 60 lists and the Union for 
Democracy and Progress (UDP), 19. Independent candidates are 
standing on 57 lists. 
  During the campaign, which began this week, a magistrate's 
office was burned down at Akjout in the west of the country, 
fighting broke out between party activists at Aleg in the south, 
and a district administrator resigned at Kiffa, 600 kilometres 
(370 miles) south of Nouakchott, to protest against what he 
called attempts at fraud by the PRDS. 
  Observers here expect a close race in the capital and have 
not ruled out a run-off round of voting. In the provinces, 
strong support for Hamdy Ould Moukhnass's UDP has been reported 
from the large eastern towns of Aioun and Tintane, while the UFD 
has widespread backing among the non-Moorish black peoples of 
the south.

  [Text] Nouakchott, Jan 20 (AFP) -- The head of the 
Mauritanian Association for Human Rights, which is unrecognised 
by the authorities, has been arrested for alleged incitement to 
agitation, an informed source said Friday [21 January]. 
  Sheikh Sadibou Camara, who is also a member of the executive 
of the opposition Union for Democracy and Progress (UDP), is 
accused of saying that descendants of former slaves whose 
parents had lost trace of them had been sold. 
  Under Mauritanian law any reference to a return to the 
country's traditional practice of slavery is considered 
prejudicial to national unity and banned. 
  The UDP for its part said Camara's arrest Thursday followed 
contacts he had with the human rights organisation Agir Ensemble 
(Act Together) in condemning the conduct of the campaign for 
municipal elections on January 28.

  [Text] With four days to go for the municipal elections in 
Mauritania the opposition is already crying wolf. It has 
denounced the attempts of massive fraud made by the Nouakchott 
government. 
  In connection with these elections, Sheikh Sadibou Camara, 
influential leader of the opposition, was arrested on 20 
January. Sadibou Camara is also the chairman of the Mauritanian 
Human Rights Association. For Camara's lawyer, Fatimata Mbaye, 
this arrest is connected with his fight against slavery in 
Mauritania: 
  [Mbaye] Professor Camara is a well-known figure whose 
activities are no secret to anyone. He is not only a human 
rights activist, but also takes part in the UN efforts to fight 
slavery. He is also a member of the board of administration of 
a nongovernmental antislavery organization. It is therefore 
quite normal for Prof. Camara to stand against slavery. What is 
really interesting is that Prof. Camara's arrest occurred around 
the time that the Acting Together and the International Human 
Rights Federation joint delegation arrived in Mauritania -- a 
delegation which received authorization at the Mauritanian 
Embassy in Paris -- only four days after getting this 
authorization. 
  Like every Mauritanian who is at all aware of the 
Mauritanian political atmosphere, we quite understand the 
reaction of the Mauritanian authorities inasmuch as Prof. Camara 
is an influential personality who plays quite an important role 
in his party, the Union for Democracy and Progress, by 
attracting a large number of activists. This is just another 
violent act which the authorities have perpetrated on our new 
democracy. 
  Prof. Camara's arrest has, since this morning, raised a 
general outcry within the international community. Here is the 
reaction of the chairman of the International Human Rights 
Federation, Daniel Jacob: 
  [Jacob] I have sent a telegram to the Mauritanian head 
of state asking him to release the professor immediately because 
he was arrested as a result of his human rights activities in 
Mauritania. We are contacting immediately the UN working group 
on this disappearance -- on this arbitrary detention -- and on 
this situation which we consider as particularly serious 
because, according to the information in our possession, the 
main accusation against Prof. Camara is first, he continued to 
head an association that did not have the required authorization 
and second, and above all, he gave information to the 
investigation mission of the international federation which was 
in Mauritania last week. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Given the fact that reports 
reveal that he was being detained in extremely difficult 
conditions, do you think you have other means of pressure that 
can make the Mauritanian Government soften its stand and release 
him immediately? 
  [Jacob] I personally wrote to Colonel Taya asking him 
to understand that the international organizations that finally 
adopted a relatively lenient attitude owing to some progress in 
the promotion of freedom of opinion, are perhaps going to revise 
their stand and then complain to the French Government. 
  Here is another reaction from Gaita Motou, an official of 
the 
research bureau of Amnesty International in Paris: 
  [Motou] We launched what we call an urgent program of 
action in (?collaboration) with all our sections and groups of 
persons working on our urgent program of action asking them to 
contact the Mauritanian Government and demand the release of 
Prof. Camara since 21 January. 
  [Reporter] The accusation often leveled against Amnesty 
International is that it remains in its Paris or London bureau 
to criticize the public authority in Africa. In this particular 
case, have you sent a mission to Mauritania to see the 
conditions in which Prof. Camara is being detained? 
  [Motou] This accusation leveled against us is quite 
unfounded. In the case of Mauritania, we tried to go there to 
express our concern, but we have never received any answer. We 
think that intensifying the pressure that we have been bringing 
to bear on the Mauritanian Government since 21 January might 
make it change its mind.

Civilian Affairs Committee, tasked with transferring civilian 
powers from the Israelis to the Palestinians in accordance with

for today until next week. 
  Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, head of the Palestinian radio and 
television corporation, which is still under formation, has told 
MENA that in its two sessions yesterday the committee discussed

Government has earmarked $30 million to set up this important 
facility. 
  The one-day session in Taba of the Civilian Affairs 
Committee, under Lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi on the Palestinian side 
and Gadi Zohar, head of the Israeli Civilian Administration in 
the West Bank, is the fastest round of talks yet held between 
the two sides. 
  The Security and Civilian Affairs Committees are scheduled 
to 
resume their sessions in Taba next Monday [31 January], by which 
time the diplomatic maneuvers that Egypt is carrying out with 
Israel to overcome the obstacles to the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement will have been clarified.

Nabil Sha'th and comprised of Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq 
al-Yahya, commander of the Palestine Liberation Army; Hasan 
'Asfur; and Dr. Camille Mansur met today in Cairo to discuss the

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ambassador to the United States </F>
Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, head of the Jordanian delegation to the 
peace talks, in Washington, by Kassab Samawi in Amman; on 24 
January -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Samawi] Dr. Fayiz, since the last round of the 
peace talks, the peace process has witnessed rapid and extremely 
important developments. The most important of these 
developments were the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli 
Declaration of Principles and the mutual recognition, as well as 
the Arab-U.S. summits, foremost of which were the meeting which 
was held between His Majesty King Husayn and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, and the Syrian president's meeting with the U.S. 
President. Can you tell us about the impact of these 
developments' on the peace process? 
  [Al-Tarawinah] There are many points. Of course, there are 
positive signs, particularly that all sides have announced their 
commitment to the peace process itself. However, we want to 
clarify the bases and to further test intentions and the 
negotiations process itself. This is because there are detailed 
issues. There are also relevant principles. Therefore, the 
summit meetings are positive developments. Moreover, there were 
developments that made the situation more ambiguous, 
particularly the talks on the Palestinian-Israeli track. Based 
on this, we must test intentions, at the level of the 
negotiators, to define the nature and form of the next round of 
negotiations. We still insist on a full track that proceeds 
simultaneously with the other brothers, based on the Madrid 
formula and the terms of reference. Of course, we should take 
into consideration all the developments that have taken place. 
As for us, since we initialed the agenda on 14 September 1993, 
we have never had the chance to discuss items on this agenda. 
This is why we are concerned about a full track that proceeds 
simultaneously with the other brothers in order to be able to 
begin discussion of the details on the agenda. 
  [Samawi] Recent Arab-U.S. summits focused on the need for 
the 
U.S. Administration to play a more effective role in the peace 
process. What are your expectations regarding the U.S. role. 
  [Al-Tarawinah] The U.S. role at this stage, concerning 
consultations among heads of delegations, will be a facilitative 
role regarding preparation for and facilitating the meeting 
itself. However, taking into consideration that they are the 
cosponsor of the peace talks, we will update them. There will 
be direct contact with them. At the end of the consultations, 
which we do not know how long they will take, we and the U.S. 
side will hold a joint assessment in order to decide on the next 
stage. The U.S. side is tirelessly trying to create an 
atmosphere where all sides would eventually achieve progress. 
However, they will not directly participate in the meetings of 
the heads of delegations. They will take part in the assessment 
process at the end of the meeting. Each party will also hold 
separate consultations with the U.S. side.

  [Excerpt] Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli 
delegation to the talks with Jordan, has welcomed King Husayn's 
remarks regarding his desire for a warm peace with Israel. The 
king made these remarks during a meeting with Jewish leaders in 
Washington. Mr. Rubinstein reacted to the king's remarks during 
the opening of the 12th round of peace talks in Washington. Our 
correspondent Arye Golan reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Golan] On the very day in which the 
unofficial meetings between the heads of the Syrian, Jordanian, 
Lebanese, and Palestinian tracks took place, King Husayn held 
his first meeting ever with Jewish leaders in Washington. When 
asked for details regarding Crown Prince Hasan's remarks to 
YEDI'OT AHARONOT on a warm peace, King Husayn said this includes 
economic cooperation between Israel and Jordan, joint projects 
in the Jordan Valley, a joint Jordanian-Israeli-Egyptian 
electricity grid, a road passing from Jordan to Egypt via Elat, 
etc. 
  Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation, was 
naturally satisfied with these remarks: 
  [Rubinstein] Every remark by a senior Jordanian official -- 
especially the king himself -- regarding the contents of peace 
is an encouraging sign for the upcoming talks. Naturally, we 
welcome these remarks, but we could add to the king's list some 
other issues that could be dealt with in the negotiations. We 
would also like to hope that the rate of progress will meet our 
expectations. 
  [Golan] All its goodwill notwithstanding, it is clear that 
Jordan is not rushing to sign a peace treaty with Israel because 
of what is referred to here as regional constraints -- namely, 
Syria and the Palestinians. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] A new round of Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, the 
first since last September, began in Washington last night. No 
information was released on the first session of these talks. 
Details are in the following report: 
  For the first time since the start of the Arab-Israeli peace 
talks in Washington two years ago, these negotiations are being 
held outside the U.S. State Department headquarters, at an 
unspecified venue, amid total secrecy and away from the media. 
Only the heads of the Jordanian, Syrian, Lebanese, Palestinian, 
and Israeli delegations participated. Their movements were also 
kept secret. 
  The U.S. State Department said only that the negotiations 
were held about 1.5 km north of the State Department in the 
hotel district. A U.S. State Department spokeswoman said that 
the talks will achieve better results if there is emphasis on 
the need to put progress ahead of publicity. She added that 
this form of negotiations allows the parties to explore each 
other's views in a totally calm manner. 
  The only statement about last night's session came from 
Itamar Rabinovich, head of the Israeli delegation to the 
negotiations with Syria. He said the first meeting with the 
Syrians was held in a serious and positive atmosphere, adding 
that he got the impression that the two sides are hoping to 
achieve progress. However, he said, they also have a lot of 
work to do and it is not possible to expect a breakthrough soon. 
  Asked about the United States' role, the State Department 
spokeswoman said that the Americans held regular dialogue with 
the concerned parties on resuming these talks, and they will 
definitely be ready to hold new talks and discussions.

  [Text] Riyadh, Jan 25 (AFP)--PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat has 
sealed a reconciliation with Saudi King Fahd in a bid to revive 
political and financial backing from the oil-rich Gulf 
monarchies, Palestinian officials said Tuesday. 
  "This meeting was a success. It opens a new page in 
relations between the two sides," said an aide to 'Arafat. 
  King Fahd and the PLO chairman spent an hour on Monday 
"reviewing bilateral relations and developments in the Middle 
East peace process, especially the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy 
negotiations," he said, declining to be named. 
  Saudi television showed footage of the meeting but there was 
no comment from officials in Riyadh, which has spurned the PLO 
for the past three years for siding with Iraq during the Gulf 
crisis. 
  "King Fahd expressed his support and that of the Saudi 
Government to the Palestinian cause and people," senior PLO 
official Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh told reporters. 
  A Palestinian diplomat added: "The meeting was very friendly 
and it helped to blow away the summer storm in bilateral 
relations. The future is promising." 
  On Tuesday, 'Arafat met Prince Salman Bin-'Abd-al-Aziz, who 
is the emir of Riyadh and an influential member of the royal 
family who heads a Saudi committee in charge of collecting funds 
for the Palestinians. 
  'Arafat later visited the mausoleum of the Prophet Muhammad 
in the western town of Medina and was to leave for Egypt to meet 
President Husni Mubarak for further talks on the launch of 
Palestinian self-rule. 
  On Sunday, he made a pilgrimage to Islam's holiest shrines 
in 
Mecca. 
  Since the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, 'Arafat was not 
welcome in Saudi Arabia because of the Palestinians' support for 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. 
  Saudi Arabia, which had been the PLO's principal financial 
backer, cut off its annual 85.5-million-dollar subsidy in 
retaliation. 
  'Arafat last met King Fahd on August 8, 1990, six days after 
the invasion, and failed to persuade him to agree to an "Arab" 
solution to end the crisis instead of a Western military 
intervention. 
  The king spurned 'Arafat's initiative, and a US-led 
multinational coalition used Saudi Arabia as its launching pad 
for "Operation Desert Storm" which drove the Iraqis out of 
Kuwait in February 1991. 
  Fellow Gulf monarchies also cut off aid to the PLO, 
triggering a financial crisis within the organisation. 
  But the Saudi authorities allowed Prince Salman's committee 
to continue its work after the war, collecting 10 million 
dollars a year in voluntary contributions and deductions from 
the salaries of Palestinian workers. 
  By 1993 the kingdom had begun to soften its stance, pledging 
100 million dollars to help implement Palestinian autonomy 
starting in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank region of Jericho. 
  "Relations with Saudi Arabia are a top priority for us," a 
Palestinian diplomat said. 
  Attempts for a reconciliation a year ago fell apart when 
'Arafat received the "Mother of All Battles" medal from Saddam 
in Baghdad. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organisation is anxious to restore 
close ties with the kingdom, which is seen as the leader of the 
Gulf Arab states and would be a powerful ally as the PLO tries 
to launch its self-rule deal with Israel. 
  In September, 'Arafat visited Oman, the first Gulf monarchy 
to ease strains with the PLO. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain 
and Qatar have also improved ties, but Kuwait insists on an 
official apology before it "forgives" 'Arafat.

His Majesty King Husayn Bin-Talal of the Hashemite Kingdom of

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas by </F>
AL-DUSTUR correspondent Salih al-Qallab in Aden; date not given] 
  [Text] [Al-Qallab] We have noticed that the subcommittee 
formed to follow up on the implementation of the accord document 
has not yet donce anything. Are there any obstacles in its way? 
  [Al-'Attas] On the contrary. The committee began its work 
yesterday (the day before yesterday) in the afternoon. It has 
drawn up a program to discuss what it is going to do. The 
committee is now discussing the venue for the endorsement of the 
agreement. Jordan and the Sultanate of Oman have been suggested 
as possibilities for the signing ceremony. We proposed Jordan 
in light of His Majesty King Husayn's concern about the crisis 
and his efforts to resolve it. The same goes for Sultan Qabus 
and many other brothers and friends. 
  After dealing with this point, the committee will move on to 
another. It will name the people who will attend the ceremony 
on Arab and international levels. This will give the ceremony 
more weight, since an international presence represents one of 
the guarantees for implementation of this agreement, which is 
the outcome of immense efforts made by all parties and political 
forces in Yemen. 
  In addition to these two tasks, the subcommittee should 
study 
security arrangements, so the leaders will be able to go to 
their workplaces. The question of security is very important 
and the entire Yemeni nation is preoccupied with it. The 
subcommittee also has to think about how it will go about 
implementing the accord after its endorsement and how to prevent 
any obstacles that could be presented by the parties harmed in 
the process. 
  [Al-Qallab] Do you think that some parties which signed the 
agreement are trying to go back on what they have signed and are 
trying to procrastinate? 
  [Al-'Attas] All the parties that signed the agreement have 
continued to welcome it and assert the need to implement it. 
  [Al-Qallab] Some Arabic newspapers have reported that House 
of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar 
has some reservations about the document, even though his party 
has signed it. Is this true? 
  [Al-'Attas] Yes, this is true. I have also noticed that the 
AL-SAHWAH newspaper, which speaks for the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping, reflects something like this. These reservations were 
announced during the drafting and discussion of the document. 
However, after consultations and exchange of views, it was 
drafted without any reservations. I have to say here that after 
we drafted the document and while we were still in the 
conference hall, we noticed that some papers were circulated 
with new reservations, but these reservations were not accepted 
by the parties to the dialogue. 
  [Al-Qallab] When you say papers, do you mean the letter 
reportedly sent by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar to the 
subcommittee? 
  [Al-'Attas] Not at all. The letter of Shaykh 'Abdallah came 
before this stage, and was welcomed by the dialogue committee. 
However, we noticed that SABA' (the official Yemeni News Agency) 
did not report the fact that the dialogue committee welcomed the 
letter when it disseminated a report about the subject. 
  [Al-Qallab] The topical question one poses here and 
everywhere is about the nature of the challenge this document 
faces? 
  [Al-'Attas] This is not the first document that has been 
signed and not been implemented. However, it differs from the 
others because it will bring about major changes in Yemen, and 
will set Yemen on the right and sound path not only with respect 
to unity, but also with respect to the establishment of a modern 
state of institutions. 
  The big challenge we face is how to get support for this 
document and work together within a broad national framework to 
implement its provisions. 
  Here, I must point out that there are forces which have 
started to work against the document and its implementation. In 
my opinon, these forces will try more viciously in the future to 
abort what has been agreed upon. Therefore, we should secure 
Yemeni popular guarantees and even Arab and international 
guarantees to foil the attempts of these forces and to have our 
country take the required step forward. 
  [Al-Qallab] Does this mean you expect some sort of action by 
the opposition forces to block the road to the implementation of 
this document? 
  [Al-'Attas] There is no doubt about this. That's why we 
propose Arab and international guarantees because we expect 
military action to harm the agreement and move in the opposite 
direction. 
  [Al-Qallab] We heard that a plane carrying foreign oil 
experts was hijacked two days ago while it was on its way from 
Sanaa to Sirwah and that there is tension on the military level 
there. Is this true? 
  [Al-'Attas] These acts are carried out by the forces which 
oppose unity. These forces revealed their real faces 
immediately following unity. They carried out several actions 
harming security and targeting Yemeni national figures, 
particularly Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders and cadres and 
some leaders of the General People's Congress [GPC], and figures 
from other parties. 
  In addition to this, these forces targeted oil companies, 
and 
what happened the day before yesterday is part of this ongoing 
series. 
  [Al-Qallab] Is the issue of the plane over, and have the 
hijackers given themselves up? 
  [Al-'Attas] No. Efforts are still under way. It is known 
that two days before the hijacking of this plane, another plane 
was hijacked. This reminds us of the incident of the kidnapping 
of the U.S. diplomat. As soon as he was released, a German 
national was kidnapped. 
  If you ask why these things occur, I will tell you it 
because 
the way we handle those who commit such deeds is wrong. For 
example, when a tribesman carries out a kidnapping, the 
authorities placate him instead of arresting him and taking him 
to court. This encourages others to do the same thing. This is 
one of the points on which I have not budged as I have 
repeatedly rejected placating kidnappers when they commit the 
crime of hijacking. 
  [Al-Qallab] We notice that you talk about those who carry 
out such acts as if they were ghosts. You are not giving names. 
Who are those people behind the kidnappings, explosions, and 
assassinations? 
  [Al-'Attas] We know the names and affiliations of those 
people, but we avoid talking about them because we are doing our 
best not to harm any party directly unless we are sure. You 
know that a person is innocent until proven guilty. The problem 
is that some people are trying to obstruct the activity of the 
judiciary, which should pass an honest, impartial judgment. 
  Giving a more active role to the judiciary would spare us 
many problems, especially concerning the trading of accusations 
between the major powers. For example, a certain party could be 
accused of being behind a certain incident, but the court could 
prove its innocence, and thus sedition would be prevented. 
  [Al-Qallab] Who is preventing the judiciary from playing its 
role? 
  [Al-'Attas] Last August, I addressed a letter to the 
Presidential Council asking for either the arrest of those who 
are carrying out the explosions and assassinations -- who 
include Armed Forces officers -- or sacking the Interior 
Ministry command, because it is not implementing the 
instructions it is receiving from the Prime Ministry. The 
government could also resign. The result was that only one 
person from the southern provinces was arrested and the police 
and security agencies in the southern and eastern provinces 
carried out their duty while the police in other provinces did 
not do anything. 
  [Al-Qallab] The YSP Central Committee -- and you are a 
member of the YSP Political Bureau -- has made a decision on the 
return of some ministers and senior officials to Sanaa. 
However, we see that you are still in Aden. Is this a position 
you have adopted? 
  [Al-'Attas] I am here for private reasons. 
  [Al-Qallab] You were the target of an assassination attempt 
a while ago, did you find out who was behind the attempt? 
  [Al-'Attas] Of the dozens of attempts that took place in 
Sanaa over a two-year period, my bodyguards managed to arrest 
one of the culprits while he was placing a large explosive 
device near my house. At the time, I was meeting with my 
deputies. Had the explosion occurred, it would really have been 
a disaster. The strange thing is that the emergency service was 
notified in advance that an explosion had occurred, but the 
ambulance went to another location by mistake. That person was 
caught in the act. Several reports were then sent to the 
Interior Ministry about the incident, but the reports were 
changed after they arrived at the ministry. It was later 
discovered that there was a great infiltration of the security 
agencies. I can say for sure that this applies to other 
attempts against several senior officials and some nationalist 
figures. I want to say that if the security question is not 
settled, things will get worse. 
  [Al-Qallab] You have said that you are staying here in Aden 
for private reasons. But in light of what you have just said 
and of the attempt on your life, and after you have been 
prevented from entering the capital of your country, I believe 
that your refusal to return to Sanaa is a glaring sign of 
protest. Is this true? 
  [Al-'Attas] Of course, this is absolutely true. This is 
because the continuation of this situation has very grave 
consequences for Yemen. It is difficult to go ahead when 
matters, including those concerning expenditure, are decided 
behind the back of the prime minister. 
  [Al-Qallab] We have heard that some 20 billion Yemeni riyals 
have been counterfeited. Is this true? 
  [Al-'Attas] First, I would like to say that there have been 
no cases of Yemeni bills being counterfeited. However, there 
have been some cases of other currencies being counterfeited. 
  [Al-Qallab] Can you give us examples? 
  [Al-'Attas] Yes. There have been cases of Saudi riyals and 
U.S. dollars being counterfeited. These two currencies are 
being used [in Yemen]. 
  [Al-Qallab] If the document is signed but not implemented, 
will you remain in office, with the situation that you have 
described in mind? 
  [Al-'Attas] By God, I explicitly say that if the document is 
not signed, or signed but not implemented, I cannot stay in 
office. 
  [Al-Qallab] In this case--if the document is not signed, or 
signed but not implemented--do you not have fears for the unity 
of Yemen? 
  [Al-'Attas] This document is the last chance. If it is not 
signed and implemented, then no one can predict the volume of 
the catastrophe that will befall Yemen. Hence, I say that we 
refuse for the document to be accepted only in an attempt to 
abort it. 
  [Al-Qallab] I heard that your party has decided to 
unilaterally implement the document in the areas under your 
control even if the document is not signed? 
  [Al-'Attas] In practice, especially concerning local 
government, some steps can be taken in this regard. 
  [Al-Qallab] In the past, you--the YSP--were accused of being 
atheist and communist. Now, you are accused of being pro-Saudi 
and pro-Kuwaiti. Why are these charges made? 
  [Al-'Attas] These are nothing but political vituperations. 
Time has proven that these charges are unfounded. At this 
point, I would like to say that the YSP wants good relations 
with the neighboring states in the Arabian Peninsula. I also 
say that despite the known circumstances, our stance on the Gulf 
crisis has been clear. 
  [Al-Qallab] Will Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid return to 
Sanaa before the document is signed? 
  [Al-'Attas] Never. He will not return before the document is 
signed.

<F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah] </F>
  [Excerpt] Aden -- Brigadier General Khalid Baras, 
chairman of the National Committee stemming from the Hadramaut 
national conference in Yemen, has called for the amendment of 
the "document of pledge and accord" before it is signed. That 
was the first reaction to the document announced by the National 
Dialogue Committee for the settlement of the crisis between 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid. Brig. Gen. Baras also requested a percentage of 
the oil royalties for Hadramaut. Observers fear that that 
demand might hinder the agreement as the Follow-up Committee 
holds its first meeting today to name the venue and set a date 
for the signing of the agreement by the Yemeni president, vice 
president, and House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. 
  In his capacity as chairman of the national conference in 
the 
governorate of Hadramaut, Brig. Gen. Baras told AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT that the document was not as broad as we had expected. 
He urged reconsideration on the question of the percentage that 
the governorate or district should get of the oil and mineral 
wealth it produces and of its fishing resources, no matter how 
small. 
  Speaking on behalf of the Hadramaut Governorate, the biggest 
governorate and richest in oil, fish, and agricultural products, 
Brig. Gen. Baras said that giving a reasonable portion of the 
revenues of the wealth produced by each governorate to that 
governorate was a point included in the recommendations and 
demands of the Hadramaut national conference held in 
mid-December. 
  Baras is a veteran politician who recently resigned from the 
General Committee (Central Committee) of the General People's 
Congress led by Yemen's president because of the party's 
policies resulting in the country's crisis. He said: The 
districts should be granted more powers including promulgation 
of laws to safeguards many rights of the inhabitants. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Hammud Munsir] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sanaa--The preparations for a meeting of the 
leaders of Yemen's ruling coalition parties to sign the document 
of pledge and accord are facing numerous difficulties, the most 
significant being disagreement over the venue. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned from highly placed political 
sources in the government coalition that the committee charged 
with making the arrangements for the meeting continued its 
deliberations in Sanaa yesterday under the chairmanship of 
Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib. 
It held its first meeting the day before yesterday but failed 
to reach agreement because of the vast difference between the 
proposals submitted by the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [YSP] and 
the General People's Congress [GPC]. 
  The sources confirmed that the YSP suggested holding the 
meeting for signing the document in the Jordanian capital Amman 
under Arab and international sponsorship to guarantee 
implementation of the agreement as the basis for building the 
Yemeni state. The GPC, however, initially rejected that 
proposal and insisted that the signing should take place in any 
Yemeni city. 
  A high-ranking GPC source has told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih expressed willingness to sign the 
agreement with his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Sanaa, Aden, or 
any other Yemeni city, but he does not want to go abroad because 
he does not want the issue to assume an international dimension. 
Political sources close to the coalition leadership, however, 
have stated that the GPC agreed late yesterday to the meeting 
being held in Amman provided that the president and Vice 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid return to Aden, after which the 
president would return to Sanaa. 
  Asked why al-Bid insists on remaining in Aden even after the 
signing, YSP officials told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the mere 
signing of the agreement would not eliminate the reasons which 
led the YSP leaders to leave Sanaa, especially the security 
reasons. They emphasized that the implementation of the 
provisions of the agreement should be the grounds for their 
return. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ayatollah Khamene'i received President Saparmurad 
Niyazov on Thursday evening, 6 January. Niyazov's delegation, 
President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, and (?Neshati), who is a member of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran's delegation, which will hold talks 
with the visiting guests, attended the meeting. Ayatollah 
Khamene'i described Turkmenistan's declaration of independence 
as a divine blessing for the people of that republic and said he 
is convinced that the foundations of Turkmenistan will be 
gradually strengthened. 
  Khamene'i described Turkmenistan's rich natural resources 
and 
10 million hectares of productive land as an opportunity for 
that republic to become developed. In addition, Khamene'i drew 
President Niyazov's attention to the opposition of exploitive 
forces to the improvement of cooperation among the regional 
countries and pointed to the importance of establishing friendly

between the two countries are essential. He asserted: 
Turkmenistan's people are making an effort to restore their

  [Text] President Saparmurad Niyazov's visit to Tehran was 
aimed at following up on the agreements concluded between Iran 
and Turkmenistan when President Hashemi-Rafsanjani visited that 
republic in October 1993. During his stay, President Niyazov 
visited Esfahan, [name indistinct], Shiraz, and [name 
indistinct] island and became closely acquainted with Iran's 
economic opportunities and issues. Undoubtedly, the two 
countries' economic approach and resources can improve economic 
exchanges and cooperation between them. 
  The signing of some 20 cooperation agreements between Iran 
and Turkmenistan is very important for their bilateral 
relations. With these agreements we will try to quickly remove 
the effects of the 70-year long separation. In view of this, 
the protocol the two countries signed on cooperation in the 
supply of oil and natural gas, the establishment of sea and air 
links, and exchanges of agricultural products, commodities, and 
visitors is an important document. 
  The fact that Iran and Turkmenistan share a common border 
gives us an opportunity to intensify our economic and cultural 
interaction. The common historic and cultural ties between the 
two sides may further promote their relations. 
  Meanwhile, Iran is a bridge between Turkmenistan and the 
other republics in Central Asia and with the Persian Gulf and 
the Indian Ocean. Considering the efforts of several Western 
countries following the USSR's collapse to impose their economic 
policies on the republics of Central Asia, including 
Turkmenistan, the improvement of those republics' relations with 
the regional countries, particularly the Islamic Republic of 
Iran, will be in their interest, for it will result in closer 
economic relations in which expansionist objectives have no 
place. 
  Turkmenistan has rich oil and natural gas resources. In view 
of that, it could have a special place among the republics in 
Central Asia. As for culture, Turkmenistan has been separated 
from its cultural roots as an Islamic country for more than 70 
years but it has prepared the necessary conditions to return to 
its true nature and foundations. The establishment of a network 
of cultural relations and channels between Iran and Turkmenistan 
will be one of the first steps the two countries will take in 
the future. 
  The protocol between the two countries also calls for 
exchanges of students and experts, the establishment of 
libraries, book fairs, and cultural contacts, all of which 
indicates that Tehran and Ashgabat are determined to strengthen 
their relations. 
  It must be recalled that Turkmenistan became a member of the 
Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO] and other bodies 
established by the littoral countries in the Caspian Sea region 
after the USSR collapsed. As stressed by the members of those 
organizations, participation in their activities, particularly 
in economic activities, is very important. Turkmenistan's 
opportunity to export its natural gas to foreign countries 
through Iran will play an important role in its effort to 
improve its economy. Meanwhile, the linking of Turkmenistan's 
railway system with those of Iran will enable that republic to 
reach Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkey; and that will give it 
an opportunity to reach the regional and international markets. 
Undoubtedly, the establishment of links with the region and the 
other parts of the world will not only serve Turkmenistan's own 
interests but also promote cooperation for economic development 
among the regional countries.

  [Text] Vladimir Kazimirov, Russia's special envoy on the 
Karabakh problem, arrived in Tehran last week to hold talks on 
the Karabakh problem and convey his country's views on the 
solution of the dispute between Azerbaijan and Armenia. He held 
talks with Iranian Foreign Ministry officials and other 
government representatives on that crisis. 
  The Caucasus has been the site of political and military 
clashes for more than five years. Regardless of the mediation 
efforts of several countries, the clashes and tension in that 
region have not subsided. On the contrary, they have increased. 
Reports have said that a large percentage of Azerbaijan's 
territory has been occupied by the Armenians. More than 40,000 
innocent people in Azerbaijan have either been killed or wounded 
and more than 1,000,000 others have been evicted from their 
places of residence to become refugees. In addition, the 
national monuments and establishments of the two sides have been 
destroyed as a result of the war, in which neither side stands 
to gain anything. Obviously, the prolongation of the present 
state of affairs will lead to destruction and weaken the two 
countries. 
  Considering the need for the establishment of security and 
peace and the removal of the crisis in the region, several 
countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, have made an 
effort to hold talks with the warring sides to end the fighting. 
In fact, several international organizations have urged them to 
hold bilateral talks to find a political way to end the clashes. 
In view of that, the objective behind Kazimirov's visit to 
Tehran was aimed at establishing an identity of views with the 
Islamic Republic of Iran's officials on the situation in the 
Caucasus and finding a way to end the clashes in 
Nagorno-Karabakh. It will be recalled that the Islamic Republic 
of Iran's officials have tried political initiatives to persuade 
Azerbaijan and Armenia to resolve their problems right from the 
very beginning of the clashes. In fact, they have taken 
positive steps in that direction. 
  The alteration of recognized borders through the use of 
military pressure is unacceptable in the world. The maintenance 
of territorial integrity is regarded as a most important 
principle for peace and security. In view of that, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran has urged all the countries to resolve their 
problems through talks and reconciliation. 
  The political experts are convinced that the coordination 
that may be established between the Islamic Republic of Iran and 
regional organizations and foreign countries, Russia in 
particular, will be an effective step to end the war in 
Nagorno-Karabakh.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Solitude Means Vulnerability"] </F>
  [Text] How can a strong and effective alliance be formed in 
the Middle East? 
  In order to find the answer to this question, there are a 
few 
things that are clearly taking shape in the world today and that 
we should take into consideration. 
  There are no barriers today, and radio waves are rapidly 
moving to every corner of the world. An expert in 
telecommunications technology spoke about the possibility of 
receiving more than 160 television channels in Iran that are 
beamed by three satellites from space. 
  Information and intelligence barriers, too, have been 
breached and it is very difficult to keep anything a secret. To 
put it better, there is no such thing as confidential 
information and if information is kept secret in one society, 
another society somewhere else may come to know about it. 
  Under such conditions, isolation is tantamount to gradual 
destruction. Japan has become active in Asia and has extended 
the hand of friendship to Korea, China, and other countries in 
East Asia. Why? 
  Many reasons can be listed. While Japan is a member of the 
G-7, it is also thinking of joining other alliances with its 
neighbors so that it will not be alone. And even though it is a 
big economic and technological power, it nevertheless takes into 
consideration possible dangers in the future. There was a 
report in THE WASHINGTON POST, which is known to reflect the 
views of the White House, that: "America's war with Iran is 
imminent." Referring to remarks by a Pentagon official, the 
newspaper added: "For some time now, America has been making 
the necessary preparations for a possible war." The same 
Pentagon official also referred to America's stance on the 
expansion of Iran's influence in Muslim countries in Africa and 
Asia and said: "Iran's influence is so strong that Clinton had 
to apologize to the Muslims of the world for the few minutes 
that he met with Salman Rushdie." 
  Their fear is because of the Islamic Republic's influence. 
If this influence is condensed and gathered into an alliance, 
will anyone in the world be able to entertain thoughts of a 
possible war? 
  In forming the alliance, we should not be satisfied with 
slogans alone. There should be a clear and genuine political 
strategy. Thoughts and ideas can be put into action only when 
they conform to the realities of the world today. 
  We can clearly see the sensitivity of the issue when we put 
the above news item next to the following news item: "The 20th 
Israeli-American session for military and political coordination 
in dealing with crises and in fighting terrorism opened in 
Jerusalem yesterday." 
  Such sessions have been held every two years [as published] 
since the signing of the strategic agreement between Israel and 
America in 1983; and various issues such as the dispatching of 
American materiel, arms control in the Middle East, and stopping 
Iran's maneuvers are discussed and decisions are adopted. 
  When such political-military processes are taken into 
consideration, the need to form an alliance in the Middle East 
becomes more and more obvious. We should look at the past, at 
the future, and at the coming centuries and adopt a policy that 
is effective and free from fanaticism, sloganeering, and 
contradiction. 
  Solitude in the world today means gradual vulnerability.

officials have once again accused Iran of involvement in 
Bakhtiar's assassination. London radio reports that officials 
of the French public prosecutor's office have said that Iran 
placed the necessary facilities at the disposal of Bakhtiar's 
assassins. 
  Recently France released two Iranians from French prisons. 
Following this, Paris became the target of harsh criticism by 
the United States, Britain, and some other Western countries.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Jordan has promised to closely study the 
status of U.S. firms subject to the secondary Arab boycott of 
Israel, but there will not be a blanket removal of companies 
from the so-called blacklist for the time being informed sources 
said Wednesday [19 January]. 
  The sources, commenting on ongoing contacts between the 
Jordanian government and European and American governments 
seeking to end the secondeary boycott, said Jordan did not feel 
that the time is opportune to removing the secondary list 
altogether. 
  "Jordan has promised a case-by-case consideration of the 
companies involved on the basis of its own national interests 
and the interests of the company involved, but it will not 
extend a unilateral removal of the secondary boycott at this 
point in time, said one source. 
  The primary Arab boycott of Israel bans Arab dealings with 
Israeli companies as well as companies based elsewhere but owned 
partly or wholy by the government of Israel or Israeli nationals. 
  The secondary boycott applies to companies that deal with 
Israel or have investments in Israel or use Israeli components 
in their products. 
  The U.S. and several European countries have adopted 
legislation to punish companies complying with the requirements 
of the Arab Boycott of Israel Bureau. 
  In simpler terms, it means that any company providing a 
certificate that it is not Israeli-owned and its products do not 
include Israeli components and the ship carrying their products 
does not call at Israeli ports could face stiff fines. These 
documents are required by the Arab government enforcing the 
boycott, and consignments unaccompanied by these certifications 
could be denied entry altogether into their countries. 
  A lifting of the secondary boycott was one of the key themes 
of a recent visit to the Middle East by U.S. Secretary of State 
Ron Brown, who held talks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, the 
occupied territories and Egypt. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Israeli Referendum is an Avoidance of </F>
Peace Requirements"] 
  [Text] In a step showing how much he opposes peace, Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin hastened, after the positive 
results of the al-Asad-Clinton summit, to announce his decision 
to hold a public referendum on the issue of withdrawal from the 
occupied Golan Heights should initial agreement be reached with 
Syria on this issue. 
  This is as if Yitzhaq Rabin is telling the Syrians ahead of 
time that any agreement that might be reached with them will 
ultimately be subject to this referendum novelty, which is 
unprecedented in Israel. This already cancels the issue of 
negotiating over the Golan or any other territory if the Israeli 
Government is not authorized to decide on withdrawal. 
  Indeed, what could Yitzhaq Rabin negotiate about with any of 
the Arab parties if the final say will be for the Israeli man on 
the street, whom we already know is inclined toward extremism 
and intransigence, and whom we now realize is obsessed with 
expansion after all the racism and racist grudge all Israelis 
have been raised on? 
  It was hoped the U.S. reaction would be in line with the 
Western democratic traditions which authorize the elected 
governments to make decisions based on the conventional 
parliamentary majority. However, statements by the new U.S. 
ambassador to Israel contradict this rule adopted by countries 
that champion democracy. He expressed the United States' 
support for Yitzhaq Rabin's new notion, which is a direct blow 
to all the agreements reached in Geneva just a few days ago. 
  The public referendum which Rabin is calling for is a new 
Israeli evasion of the requirements of the peace process. It 
also torpedoes the well known bases for negotiation. This is 
especially true as long as the Arabs are negotiating with a 
government that is giving up its authority to make decisions and 
is leaving agreements that could be reached up to the mood of 
the man on the street who could push an agreement one way or the 
other based on the personal whims of his leaders and through 
instigation and racist mobilization, all the effective tools 
which Israel owns.

  [Text] Amman--A joint Jordanian-American committee on 
military cooperation will meet in Washington next week for the 
first time since 1989, informed sources said Wednesday [19 
January]. 
  They said the committee, co-chaired by the chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff of Jordan and an assistant secretary of 
the U.S. Defence Department, will discuss a broad range of 
issues, including American military assistance programmes for 
the Kingdom, joint exercises and training for Jordanian 
servicemen. 
  Also discussed will be Jordan's military needs, including 
spare parts for American equipment already in use by the 
Kingdom's Armed Forces. 
  The sources noted that next week's meeting, which will 
follow 
talks between His Majesty King Husayn and President Bill Clinton 
at the White House on Friday, would be the first after the 
1990-91 Gulf crisis strained Amman-Washington relations. 
  Prior to the crisis, the commission used to meet annually in 
Washington or in Amman to work out the year's cooperation 
programmes. 
  Jordan depended on the U.S. for all its defence needs for 
nearly 30 years until 1987, when Congress turned down a $1.6 
billion arms package for the Kingdom, promoting Amman to turn to 
France and the Soviet Union to meet its requirement. 
  Washington maintained a minimum level of military assistance 
to Jordan throughout the years, including training programmes 
for Jordanian servicemen and joint military execises. 
  Following the Gulf war, the U.S. administration has released 
more than $35 million in military aid to Jordan after overcoming 
congressional hurdles related to Jordan's adherence to and 
enforcement of the international sanctions against Iraq and 
overall Arab-Israeli peace-making. 
  The strain in bilateral ties resulting from the Gulf crisis 
was gradually mended after mid-1992. King Husayn met with 
President Clinton at the White House in June 1993, sealing 
reconciliation. 
  Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, who headed for 
Washington Tuesday to join the Jan. 21 White House meeting 
between the King and President Clinton, said that 
"Jordanian-American relations are continuously improving... 
after traces of the Gulf crisis were removed." 
  Dr. al-Majali said earlier that during the King's meeting 
with President Clinton he would raise the issue of American 
military assistance for Jordan. 
  No precise figures were immmediately available on U.S. 
military assistance. A State Department document dated July 
referred to $10 million in military aid for the fiscal year 
ending September 1993. It was not known whether this has been 
released. 
  Jordan and the United States have held at least three joint 
military exercises in the southern desert and the Red Sea since 
the end of the Gulf war over Kuwait in February 1991. 
  The meetings of the joint commission will be attended by 
senior officials from all branches of the U.S. defence 
establishment, including the army, navy and air force, as well 
as representatives of the Central Command. 
  General Joseph Hoar, head of the Central Command, was in 
Amman last week in what was described as a routine visit. 
  Gen Hoar, who succeeded Gen Norman Schwartzkopf after the 
war 
of Kuwait, has visited Jordan at least twice before and during 
joint American-Jordan military exercises.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>
  [Text] Amman--An unprecedented American Rabbinical 
delegation left Jordan Friday [21 January] after visiting 
tourist sites and exchanging views with Jordanians in a mission 
billed as an expression of support for the Arab-Israeli peace 
process. 
  The tour group of 80 rabbis, including eight women, 
representing 1.5 million American Jews affiliated with 850 
synagogues, was described by its spokespersons as totally 
different in orientation and ideology from their hardline 
counterparts in Israel. 
  Those who might have taken their cue from the images that 
appear on Israel television and expected to see a group of 
long-bearded men wearing religious garb, armed with prayer books 
and humming hymns under their breath were in for a surprise. 
Most of the group's members looked more like business 
executives than religious men. 
  The visit was not without its controversies either, Shaykh 
Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman Khalifah, spiritual Leader of the Muslim 
Brotherhood movement, condemned the visit saying "this soil has 
not been stepped on by a jew since the time of Caliph 'Umar" in 
the eighth century. 
  "Our past experience has proved that Jews in the West 
plotted 
against Palestine," said Shaykh Khalifah, who also carries the 
title of the deputy secretary-general of the broader Muslim 
Brotherhood movement in the Arab World. The visit of the U.S. 
rabbinical team, he said, means a "plot against Jordan." 
  "This visit is not acceptable to us at all," he said in a 
statement. 
  Officials said the group was treated as a regular tour team 
with the only exception that extra security was provided to the 
delegation. 
  The group said its very visit to Jordan symbolised a 
yearning 
for coexistence and justice. 
  "We believe our very presence here is a story," said Rabbi 
Ammiel Hirsch, executive director of American Reformist Zionist 
Association (ARZA) and the team's leader. "We are here to 
support the peace process, and we want it brought to a 
satisfactory, comprehensive, permanent settlement." 
  Rabbi Hirsch speaking in an interview at the 
Intercontinental 
Hotel where the team stayed, said the delegation's mission was 
to "listen, to learn and to convey our impressions to public 
opinion." 
  "We are not politicians and are not an official delegation," 
said Rabbi Hirsch. 
  But, he added, "We are not a general kind of group. It is 
historical for us. To my knowledge there was never this kind of 
a group coming to Jordan..." 
  He implied that the impressions that the Rabbis carried home 
from Jordan and elsewhere in the region would have a strong 
bearing on the views of their congregations. 
  By and large, according to delegation sources, a significant 
number of the group members supports the establishment of an 
independent Palestinian state while others believe that the 
shape of a Palestinian entity is better left to direct 
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. 
  "We have met with ordinary Jordanians in al-'Aqabah and in 
Petra, and also with academics here," said Rabbi Hirsch, in his 
mid-30s. "We are very grateful for the generous hospitality that 
the Jordanians are giving us...they are very warm and friendly 
people..." 
  The rabbi voiced confidence that the peace process would be 
successful. "We obviously know very well. There is a great 
excitement in the region, in particular in Jordan, and there is 
a conviction that there be mutual social and economic benefits 
from a settlement. We would like to contibute to that process 
if we can, and that is why we are here." 
  He said the delegation was hoping to be received by His 
Royal 
Highness Crown Prince Hasan, but the meeting did not materialise 
because of scheduling problems. 
  Rabbi Hirsch said the American Jewish community was in touch 
with Arab-American leaders in order to "establish the kind of 
communications that were not established before." 
  Asked how he viewed internal Israeli opposition led by 
hardline rabbis against the peace process. Mr. Hirsch said: "I 
am not a politician and that is not why we are here. We are 
here because we support the politicies of the current Israeli 
government... a territorial compromise in exchange for a 
comprehensive permanent settlement in the Middle East. We 
support that very, very strongly." 
  The tour group arrived in Israel early this week and 
proceeded to the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, but a meeting 
with the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators there did not take 
place. 
  From Taba the group travelled to Nuwaybi' to catch the ferry 
to al-'Aqabah and then visited Petra. 
  The delegation visited Ma'daba and the nearby Mount Nebo 
Thursday. It crossed the King Husayn Bridge Friday morning.

  [Editorial Report] Amman SHIHAN in Arabic, in its 22-28 
January issue publishes on pages 8-9 an approximately 2,500-word 
interview with Jordanian Health Minister 'Abd-al-Rahim Malhas, 
who says he has effectively resigned his post to protest the 
government's leniency toward "the pharmaceuticals mafia," and 
those "who allow them to break the law." 
  In the interview, the minister explains the violations 
committed by importers of foodstuffs and medicines and accuses 
them of importing material unfit for human consumption and low 
quality and "rotten" food. He also notes that these importers 
and merchants have strong connections and "money to buy people, 
newspapers, and everything else." He also hints at differences 
with the prime minister over the way to handle the dispute with 
the merchants and importers.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ishaq al-Farhan, secretary general </F>
of the Islamic Action Front in Jordan, by Salim Badawi; place 
and date not given; from the "The Event" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Farhan] In fact, our opposition to Israel is an 
opposition in principle. This is because we view Israel as a 
mob of invaders who came from various parts of the world to 
occupy a land that is not theirs and a homeland that is not 
theirs. It has been the homeland of Arabs and Muslims for 14 
centuries. The Jews who existed in Palestine at the beginning 
of this century were a minority of no more than 5 percent. They 
have lived peacefully with the Arabs and Muslims for 14 
centuries. In principle, we are not against Judaism as a 
religion nor against the Jews as a race. We are against a 
country being occupied by foreigners. Those invaders are new 
colonialists who were supported by Britain at the beginning of 
the century and by the United States in the middle of the 
century. Thus, the Zionist plan converged with the Western 
colonialist plan to colonize Palestine. Therefore, in 
principle, those are rejected people in our homeland. 
  [Badawi] So you are against any peaceful settlement in the 
region? 
  [Al-Farhan] It is not like that. We are constant advocates 
of peace, but not when our territory is occupied by force. 
Therefore, the real solution to the Palestine question is to 
allow the Jews who lived with us for 14 centuries to stay and to 
evacuate to their own countries the Jews who came as invaders 
from overseas and from over 70 countries in the world. 
Indigenous Jews and their children and the Christians and 
Muslims of Palestine would remain. The deported Palestinians, 
who are over 4 million--not only the 400 deportees who returned 
last year--should return to their country. Afterward, in a 
democratic way, if the West is really democratic, the 
Palestinians--Muslims, Christians, and Jews--should be left to 
determine their future so that they would have equal 
opportunities and would rule themselves by themselves. 
  [Badawi] Mr. Ishaq al-Farhan, in light of the results of the 
Jordanian elections on the domestic level and in light of the 
recent Geneva summit on the foreign level, do you not feel that 
your opposing stand is being isolated? How do you expect your 
activities to be affected? 
  [Al-Farhan] In fact, true democracy has room for both 
supporters and opponents. We are a political party operating 
under the Jordanian Political Parties Law and under the 
Jordanian Charter and Constitution, which adopt democracy and 
democratization which allow everybody to express their views no 
matter how different they may be. We are neither permanent 
rejectionists nor permanent supporters of the policy of any 
government. Our opposition or support depends on stands 
themselves. With respect to the Palestine question, we have our 
known stand, which is widely respected. At the same time, we do 
not resort to violence to impose our stands. Hence, we believe 
that we are being logical with ourselves, and that others must 
be logical with us. We do not have a problem here in Jordan 
with the regime in terms of agreement or disagreement. This is 
because we view matters in a practical and realistic manner. At 
the same time, we act according to our constant and deep-rooted 
policy. As for the regional or Western circles that want to 
plot against us, we hope that they will understand the democracy 
which they advocate, and leave us alone to resolve our problems 
by ourselves. 
  [Badawi] So, what is the strategy of your future opposition. 
In other words, what are you wagering on in the future to 
reverse the current peaceful, negotiatory trend? 
  [Al-Farhan] We believe that as long as an inch of 
Palestinian 
territory is under occupation, the Palestinian resistance inside 
the Palestinian territory will continue until the occupation is 
removed from the Islamic Arab territories, headed by Jerusalem. 
We believe that irrespective of the nature of the self-rule 
that the Palestinians will attain, they will avoid any civil 
wars or domestic disputes, especially if they adopt democracy 
and shura among themselves so that they would act in harmony 
with themselves and set a starting point for the building of 
their future state, which would be supported by the neighboring 
Arab countries, especially Jordan. We are wagering on the 
assumption that proceeding from their colonialist and 
expansionist logic, the Jews will try to impose their economic 
and political hegemony on the region. Thus, they will be hated 
in the region. After they failed to impose their military 
hegemony, they will not be able to achieve their political, 
economic, educational, and cultural objectives of a greater 
Israel in the region. We are also wagering on the balances of 
power. We have recently seen how the Russian power crumbled and 
how Russia became a thing of the past. Also, we believe that 
American and European public opinion will show more 
understanding of our issue, especially if we hold fast and 
explain this issue and continue to explain it for the next 
decade. Then, the world military, political, and ideological 
balances of power may change in our interest.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Maryam M. Shahin] </F>
  [Excerpts] Amman--Two leftist political parties Wednesday 
[19 January] announced their decision to merge after months of 
negotiations between party cadres. The Jordan People's 
Democratic Party (JPDP) and the Jordanian Democratic Popular 
Unity Party (JDPUP) disclosed that their executive committees 
had agreed on a merger after a meeting late Tuesday. 
  In what was an expected move, the JPDP and JDPUP decided to 
begin their merger by creating a coordination committee for 
their respective executive committees. 
  "These have been long-standing plans and now we are 
beginning 
their implementation," said 'Azmi al-Khawajah, the secretary 
general of the JDPUP. "No one is quite sure how long it will 
take, but we are very serious about the merger. 
  The announcement follows months of negotiations between the 
two parties whose members ran on a joint six-person ticket for 
the November legislative elections. Only one of the 
joint-ticker candidates, Bassam Haddaddin of the JPDP, was 
successful in his bid for a seat in Parliament. Mr. Haddadin is 
a al-Karak deputy. 
  The two parties are Jordanian off-shoots of the Palestinian 
parties, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
(DFLP) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
(PFLP) respectively. [passage omitted] 
  For now the leadership post will rotate among 'Azmi 
al-Khawajah and JPDP Secretary General Taysir al-Zibri. The two 
parties hope that a timetable and framework will be worked out 
between the two groups by mid-February. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Islamabad, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Forces trying to oust 
president Borhanoddin Rabbani have put forward an eight-point 
plan to restore peace in Afghanistan, it was reported here 
Tuesday [25 Jan]. 
  The plan, besides a ceasefire, calls for the resignations of 
both President Rabbani and his rival Prime Minister Golboddin 
Hekmatyar and the transfer of power to an interim council until 
general elections can be held, said the official Associated 
Press of Pakistan (APP). 
  The formula was presented to Pakistan Foreign Minister 
Sardar 
Assef Ahmed Ali Monday [24 Jan] by a representative delegation 
of the Afghan Coordination Council which comprises factions 
opposed to the year-old Rabbani government. 
  It groups Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of 
Afghanistan], Uzbek general Abdol Rashid Dostam's Jonbesh-e 
Melli or National Movement, the National Liberation Front of 
former president Sibghatullah Mojaddedi and a Shiite faction of 
Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party]. 
  During the meeting which lasted 90 minutes, the council 
"responded positively" to a Pakistani proposal for a regional 
conference on Afghanistan to resolve the crisis. 
  Pakistan wants Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the Central 
Asian republics bordering Afghanistan to attend a regional 
conference. 
  In a nationwide broadcast Sunday [23 Jan] Rabbani thanked 
Pakistan, Iran and Saudi Arabia for their efforts to end the 
three-week-old bloodshed in Kabul but said his forces would 
fight on against Dostam's militia until they surrendered. 
  Rabbani said he was ready to give the Afghan people the 
right 
to choose a new leadership through elections or by convening a 
traditional assembly of Afghan elders.

  [Text] Afghan leaders have responded positively to 
Pakistan's proposal for hosting a regional peace summit or 
regional peace conference on Afghanistan. This was stated by 
the foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, while talking to 
newsmen in Islamabad today prior to his departure for Tehran to 
attend ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] ministerial 
meeting beginning tomorrow. He said the representatives of 
Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party], Jonbesh-e Melli [National 
Movement], Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party], and Jabha-e Melli 
[National Liberation Front] put up a seven-point proposal for

said it is a matter for the Afghans to decide. 
  The foreign minister said he will brief the ECO foreign 
ministers on the latest developments in Afghanistan and human 
rights violations by Indian occupation forces in occupied 
Kashmir. The ECO council of ministers will consider a broad 
range of subjects, including the establishment of ECO trade and 
development company, shipping company, airlines, and insurance 
company.

conference will be possible if all the Afghan sides agree to a 
cease-fire. He said Pakistan has heard the point of view of 
both sides in the conflict in Kabul and told them that Pakistan 
has no favorites and it stands with the Afghan nation. At this 
stage, if all Afghan parties need Pakistan's help for 
reconciliation, it is available. 
  The Afghan prime minister, Mr. Golboddin Hekmatyar, has 
welcomed Pakistan's proposal to convene a regional peace 
conference. 
  In Afghanistan itself, there are reports of sporadic 
fighting 
between the warring factions in Kabul. Both sides used 
artillery and rocket fire on each other's positions in Pul-e 
Mahmoodkhan, Bala Hesar, and Microryan.

  [Text] Islamabad: The government after a meeting with a 
delegation of important Afghan leaders on Monday [24 Jan] 
concluded that their positions remained inflexible and that they 
during a meeting with the Foreign Minister, did not demonstrate 
any flexibility on a ceasefire. 
  The five-member Afghan delegation include Dr Hashmetullah, 
ANLF, son of Sibghatullah Mojaddidi and leader of the 
delegation, Dr Talib, Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party], Abdul 
Hadi Organdiwal, Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], 
Mr Zari, Jonbesh-e Melli [National Movement], and Haji Mangal 
Hussain, Hezb-e Eslami. The foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad 
Ali was assisted by the Foreign Secretary Sharyar M. Khan, DG 
Afghan Desk, Kazi Humayun, Director Mr Aslam and Ambassador in 
Afghanistan Amir Usman. [names and titles as published] 
  Senior officials at the Foreign Office said it was 
significant that the Afghan leaders themselves had included a 
representative of General Dostam. "This means recognition for 
Dostam by the Afghans themselves and now all parties and forces 
inside Afghanistan are represented", the sources added. 
  The delegation which represented parties opposed to 
President 
Rabbani continued to insist that it would be only after the 
resignation of President Rabbani that Prime Minister Golboddin 
Hekmatyar also leave his office. 
  Source said, "government seems determined to continue to 
keep 
borders closed as this will give it some leverage against the 
Afghans. The Afghan leaders must realise that they cannot keep 
on fighting and sending their women and children here. Now the 
foreign donors are not helping and Pakistan still has the 
refugees for the last thirteen years." The sources said that 
there have been repeated suggestions by the foreign office to 
the government to open up the borders. Meanwhile, the Afghan 
leaders discussed with the foreign office the different formulas 
they have to bring about a lasting ceasefire inside Afghanistan. 
  Some of these steps include 1) resignations of the President 
and Prime Minister, 2) evacuation of all military groups from 
Kabul, 3) security of Kabul to be given to commanders of Kabul, 
4) the leaders should meet to form an interim government, 5) the 
interim government should call a Shoora. PPI adds from 
Peshawar: The Saudi ambassador to Afghanistan, Sheikh Ukabi 
held an important in camera meeting here with three prominent 
personalities from different Afghan mojahedin factions and 
discussed at length the possibilities of bringing an end to the 
ongoing bloody war for the capture of Kabul. 
  The secret meeting between Saudi ambassador, the political 
advisor to Hezb-e Eslami Qazi Muhammad Ami Waqad, Governor of 
Nangrahar Province of Afghanistan, Haji Abdul Qadeer and 
Commander Jalaluddin Haqqani of Hezb-e Eslami Yunus Khalis was 
held here in univerisity town at the Saud Red Crescent Society 
office.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on </F>
24 January; place not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the most compassionate and the 
merciful. My dear countrymen, peace be upon you. At the time 
of the establishment of Pakistan, the founder of Pakistan, the 
great leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah said Kashmir is the jugular 
vein of Pakistan. Ever since independence day, the hearts of 
the Pakistani people are with the people of Kashmir till today. 
The settlement of the Kashmir issue in accordance with UN 
resolutions for the Kashmiri people has been the cornerstone of 
our foreign policy. 
  Announcing my priorities after being elected prime minister, 
I described the settlement of the Kashmir issue as my foremost 
priority. Only a day after taking my oath as prime minister, I 
went to Cyprus in order to hold discussions with the 
Commonwealth leaders on the Kashmir problem. During my minor 
pilgrimage to Mecca, I drew the attention of the rulers of Saudi 
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates toward Indian atrocities in 
Kashmir. The Kashmir problem remained a priority for the 
government even during my visits to Iran, Turkey, China, and 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Thank God the world is 
getting apprised of the human rights violations in Jammu and 
Kashmir. India, until now, has not refrained from using every 
inhuman machination to crush the Kashmiri people's movement. We 
initiated a dialogue with India to bring home our stand to the 
world. The objective of the dialogue was to find a solution to 
Kashmir issue by peaceful means, not by violence, and in 
accordance with the UN resolutions. We hoped India would lessen 
tyranny and repression in occupied Kashmir, but, regrettably, 
this was not done. As many as 50 innocent people were martyred 
in Sopor only a day after the announcement of the start of the 
new round of negotiations. The announcement about the lifting 
of the siege of the Hazratbal Shrine was not found to be 
correct. Even today, Indian forces are present around this 
sacred shrine and are destroying its sanctity. Despite 
negotiations, Indian atrocities continue in occupied Jammu and 
Kashmir. India's objective appears to be something different. 
By staging the show of a dialogue, India wants to distract 
international public opinion and attention from its atrocities 
in order to crush the Kashmiri people's struggle free of 
international pressure. This is not acceptable to Pakistan. We 
cannot leave our Kashmiri brothers and sisters alone nor can we 
allow the intensification of repression under the cover of 
negotiations. India will have to end tyranny and repression in 
the Kashmir Valley to prove its sincerity. Negotiations will 
remain devoid of any results until the number of Indian troops 
in the Kashmir Valley is reduced, until innocent Kashmiris are 
released from Indian jails, and until international human rights 
organizations are allowed to go into Kashmir. 
  My dear countrymen, we will continue the process of 
mobilizing international public opinion against India's 
continued atrocities against our Kashmiri brethren. Pakistan 
will identify human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir at 
the UN Human Rights Commission. I, myself, will put forward 
Kashmir's case at the Human Rights Commission on 1 February. 
The objective of our efforts is to mobilize international 
public opinion and to awaken the international conscience. We 
know that international public opinion adopts double standards 
on certain occasions. The world community has not been able to 
take any effective step in connection with Bosnia; and even in 
case of Kashmir, the world's record is not that good. We, 
however, have to continue our political, diplomatic, and moral 
efforts in this changing world. We are confident that these 
efforts will ultimately be crowned with success and the 
Kashmiris will definitely achieve their right of 
self-determination, God willing. We know that nobody can crush 
the spirit of freedom. 
  When the Indian foreign secretary came to Pakistan, I told 
him that negotiations with us will be fruitful only when India 
is ready to find a political solution to the Kashmir problem; 
but Kashmir is presently burning. The Kashmiris are being 
massacred indiscriminately. As soon as the Kashmiri people 
adopted the path of struggle to achieve freedom from Indian 
subjugation, a reign of terror was let loose against them. 
Youths, children, and the aged are being made targets of 
violence. They are being made the targets of bullets in spite 
of the fact that they are unarmed. 
  Women are molested and thousands of innocent people are put 
behind bars. May I ask what is their fault? Their only fault 
is that they demand the right of a plebiscite. Giving them the 
right of plebiscite was decided by the United Nations as far 
back as 1948. Both India and Pakistan are committed to this 
decision. India has deployed 600,000 troops in the Kashmir 
valley to deny the Kashmiris the right of a plebiscite. Two 
more divisions are now being sent there. After all, how many 
more troops will they send there? When the United States could 
not control Vietnam by its forces; when the Soviet Union could 
not control Afghanistan; how can India overcome the Kashmiri 
fighters? India cannot hide its failures by raising a new iron 
curtain [preceding two words in English] in the new world. 
Amnesty International, Asia Watch, Physicians for Human Rights, 
International Federation for Human Rights are only a few 
organizations who have provided documentary proof of the Indian 
atrocities. Members of Parliament of various countries have 
raised their voice against the human rights violations in 
Kashmir. These voices are getting louder with the passage of 
time. 
  We will also raise our voice in unison with the Kashmiri 
people's voice to carry forward their movement. The Kashmiri 
people's anguish is our anguish. Their struggle is our 
struggle. To express solidarity with this struggle is our 
obligation as well as our right in accordance with international 
law. We constituted the National Assembly's Committee on 
Kashmir to express solidarity with the Kashmiri people's 
struggle and to draw the attention of international public 
opinion to the Kashmir issue. All political parties are 
represented in this committee, which is a proof that the 
Pakistani nation has complete ideological solidarity on the 
Kashmir issue. The committee is headed by the veteran 
politician, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, whose political experience 
is a treasure for all of us. The National Assembly's Committee 
on Kashmir has decided that a total strike will be observed in 
Pakistan, Azad Kashmir, and the occupied Jammu and Kashmir on 5 
February. The Government of Pakistan fully supports this 
decision. While supporting this call, I appeal to the people of 
Pakistan, Azad Kashmir, and the occupied Jammu and Kashmir to 
observe a protest strike on 5 February. This strike will 
provide proof that the Kashmiri people want to settle the 
Kashmir issue through a plebiscite in accordance with UN 
resolutions. 
  Kashmir is a jugular vein of Pakistan, and we will not allow 
our jugular vein to be trampled upon by brute force. The 5 
February strike will show to the world that the people of 
Pakistan and our Kashmir brothers and sisters are inseparable 
nations. The present democratic government considers Kashmir 
not only a part of Pakistan's history, but also its heritage. 
The people's government has the same stand on Kashmir as that 
of the founder of Pakistan, Great Leader Mohammad Ali Jinnah, 
and as that of the people's leader -- Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The 
people are aware that in the past the people's leader, Zulfiqar 
Ali Bhutto, had infused new life into this issue and highlighted 
it at the international level. I will move forward with your 
help, taking with me the mission [preceding word in English] of 
these two personalities. I as a mother, sister, and daughter 
understand the sorrow of every mother, sister, and daughter of 
Kashmir and offer prayers for the success of every father, 
brother, and son of Kashmir. I want to assure the Kashmiri 
brothers and sisters that the people's government considers the 
freedom of Kashmir a sacred duty. We want every Muslim of this 
soil to live an honorable and free life. A Muslim, whether from 
Bosnia, Palestine, or Kashmir, does not live a complete life 
without freedom. Today every Muslim wants to see Kashmir 
independent and, God willing, that day is not far when Kashmir 
will be with us. I want to assure all of you that whatever 
happens, no power on earth can prevent us from extending moral, 
diplomatic, and political support to the Kashmiris in their 
movement. The blood of martyrs is proof that we will not 
deviate from this pledge. 
  Long Live Pakistan.

  [Excerpt] The fourth meeting of foreign ministers of member 
countries of the Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO] began 
in Tehran today with a speech by President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  At the opening ceremony, the president stressed the need for 
regional cooperation and collective effort as a crucial strategy 
for the region's economic development and for coping with the 
difficulties arising from global political developments. Our 
correspondent reports: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said 
that, through strengthening and promoting our economic 
cooperation, we can present new models of cooperation for 
developing our economic infrastructure and for securing a 
lasting development, so as to reduce our economic dependence on 
the developed countries. 
  Referring to the region's potential in view of its vast 
geographical boundaries, its rich natural resources, manpower, 
extensive markets, great capacity to attract capital and 
technology, and its many other valuable resources, the president 
said: Politics and economics are two vital factors affecting the 
destiny of states. Both of them, by influencing one another, 
could secure the region's economic development; that is, the 
main objective of the ECO. This would be a factor enabling the 
member countries to enjoy greater power to maintain their 
economic independence and to take charge of their own destiny. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani pointed out: Many of the member 
countries' national plans can be prepared in such a way that the 
upgrading of the level of regional relations would accelerate 
overall cooperation. The president added: The grounds for 
cooperation, endorsed and approved in two documents of practical 
plan and long-term planning, are very appropriate and useful. 
If implemented, they would meet major needs of the member 
countries in the important fields of communication, trade, 
industry, culture, science, agriculture, and infrastructure 
across the region. 
  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani went on to refer to the Islamic 
Republic of Iran's stances based on respect for international 
borders, the peaceful resolution of political disputes, the 
peaceful solution of internal discords in other countries, the 
prevention of tyranny and injustice, and the defense of the 
justified rights of human beings. He declared: We wish to see 
the ECO members enjoy security and tranquillity too. May the 
constructive approach of combining thoughts and cooperating with 
the nations of the region manifest itself in the speedy 
reconstruction of their countries. He added: Along this path 
the Islamic Republic of Iran would not refrain from undertaking 
any efforts, and it expects the other ECO members to employ all 
their efforts for this purpose. 
  The president continued: Unfortunately the arrogant powers 
do 
not care about ending tensions and destructive regional 
conflicts in the Third World as long as their own interests are 
not threatened. On occasion they even fan the flames so as to 
realize their satanic objectives and to pursue their 
illegitimate interests. The Tehran session is, therefore, an 
appropriate opportunity for an exchange of views on political 
situation of the region, to restore stability and security.

  [Text] After the speech delivered by the president at the 
meeting of foreign ministers of the Economic Cooperation 
Organization [ECO], a ceremony was held transferring the annual 
presidency from Pakistan to the Islamic Republic of Iran. Having 
become the meeting's chairman, Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati delivered a speech on the reasons for holding the 
meeting and ways in which ECO members can cooperate. 
  Mr. Velayati said: In order to achieve its aims, ECO needs 
to 
benefit from the experience and financial and technical 
cooperation of specialist and international organizations. In 
this connection, it is willing to provide part of the costs of 
implementing joint projects. The foreign minister said that 
progress will not be possible unless ECO members make serious 
and constant efforts. He added: It is vital for the 
organization to find new ways to expedite decisionmaking and the 
implementation of projects. He also said that the Islamic 
Republic of Iran is of the opinion that part of the region's 
fundamental needs will be met with the commencement and 
expansion of the activities of institutions affiliated to ECO, 
such as the bank for development and commerce, the reinsurance 
company [bimeh-ye etteka'i], ECO's science foundation, ECO's 
cultural foundation, the shipping and airline transport 
organizations, as well as other planned ECO organizations. 
  Our correspondent's report states that the session continued 
with speeches delivered by a number of other participants.

  [Text] My colleague had an interview with Foreign Minister 
Mr. Velayati on the sidelines of the Economic Conference 
Organization [ECO] ministerial session. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] The fourth session of the 
ECO Council of Foreign Ministers has opened in Tehran with the 
presence of more than ten delegations from the member countries. 
Mr. Foreign Minister, could you briefly explain what issues have 
so far been discussed in the meeting, and what is the expected 
outcome of this consular [as heard] meeting? 
  [Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. As you know, ten countries have participated at high 
level -- mostly at the level of foreign ministers -- in this 
very meeting. 
  In this meeting we will review what the Council of Deputies 
[deputy ministers] have discussed and the different committees 
and commissions during last year, before the third foreign 
ministers' meeting. And these foreign ministers' meetings have 
been held in Iran, in Pakistan, in Turkey, in different Central 
Asian countries, and the Caucasus. We have had many committees 
and commissions. And those committees and commissions they have 
made many decisions. We have to approve all these decisions. 
And this is the final approval. According to the Izmir Treaty, 
the main decisions should be made in the Council of Ministers, 
which consists mainly of the foreign ministers of these 
countries. We do hope that we can adopt a timetable for next 
year and all projects that we are going to fulfill in different 
countries in connection with the ECO. 
  [Correspondent] When and where will the next session of the 
ECO foreign ministers be held? 
  [Velayati] Usually, the interval between the ministerial 
meetings is one year. So, we expect that the next ministerial 
meeting will be held one year from now, after one year. But, as 
far as the venue of the meeting is concerned, I have to say that 
this decision should made during this session. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you very much. [end recording]

  [Text] A two-day meeting of the Economic Cooperation 
Organization [ECO] foreign ministers began in Tehran yesterday. 
Addressing the meeting on behalf of Foreign Minister Najmuddin 
A. Shaikh, the Pakistani ambassador to Iran drew the ministerial 
council's attention to the atrocities being carried out by 
Indian forces in occupied Kashmir and the serious human rights 
violations there. He said that the world cannot remain a silent 
spectator when innocent Kashmiris are being massacred and their 
houses set on fire. He said that Pakistan wants a peaceful 
settlement of the Kashmir dispute. It will not, however, 
deceive the international community by holding meaningless talks. 
  The acting leader of the Pakistani delegation also referred 
to the killing of innocent citizens in Afghanistan and expressed 
Pakistan's grave concern in this regard. He discussed the steps 
Pakistan has taken to achieve the ECO's objectives, saying that 
the Karakoram Highway will be reinforced to withstand the heavy 
traffic moving from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to China. 
  Earlier, inaugurating the meeting, Iranian President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani highlighted the need for regional cooperation 
to achieve collective self-reliance and economic development.

  [Text] Tehran, Jan. 25, IRNA -- Foreign ministers of the 
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) here today reviewed 
topics in relation to transportation and communications between 
the 10 member states. 
  A detailed plan presented by ECO's transportation ministers 
in Almaty last November is becoming operational now. 
  As Azerbaijan republic and the Central Asian states joined 
ECO in 1992 following their independence from Soviet rule, the 
organization has taken big strides in an effort to cooperate 
with other international organizations. 
  Afghan Foreign Minister Arsala proposed that ECO establish a 
center for surface transport and transit between member states. 
  Foreign minister of the Republic of Azerbaijan Gasan Gasanov 
said the joining of the seven new regional countries to the 
organization makes it all the more capable. He said mutual 
trust among members was necessary to promote the business ties 
within the ECO. 
  Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said his government 
attaches special importance to relations with neighboring 
countries, while the Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan, Tuleutai I. 
Suleymenov, proposed the formation of a mercantile development 
bank of member states this year. 
  The Kazakh foreign minister said his country is to embark on 
its national development plans this year and looks forward to 
closer cooperation with ECO. 
  The Kyrgyz official to the fourth ECO foreign ministerial 
which opened this morning, said his country was keen on 
supplying member states with electricity. 
  The total power generation in Kyrgyzstan totals 143 billion 
kilowatts per hour, which he said, is a mere 10 per cent of the 
vast potential of the country. 
  Tajikistan Foreign Minister Aliyev for his part favoured the 
setting up of an ECO financial body and said his country will 
study the suggestions made at the session. 
  Pakistani Foreign Ministry representative, Najmuddin Shaikh, 
called for strengthening of infrastructural projects in member

<F P=106> [Report from Washington by Natan Gutman] </F>
  [Excerpts] Israeli sources said that the first day of 
talks in Washington between the heads of the Syrian and Israeli 
delegations was positive. According to the sources, Muwaffaq 
al-'Allaf, head of the Syrian delegation, demonstrated an 
encouraging approach, although there was no room to talk of 
progress. 
  Itamar Rabinovich, the head of the Israeli delegation, told 
al-'Allaf that the two issues which the talks had focused on up 
til now -- the question of withdrawal and the nature of peace -- 
have already been sufficiently discussed and progress was made 
on them; therefore, Rabinovich would now like to move on to the 
issue of security arrangements on the Golan Heights. Israeli 
sources refused to interpret these remarks or to say whether 
they mean that Syria and Israel have already reached agreement 
with regard to withdrawal and the nature of peace. [passage 
omitted] 
  The meeting between Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich and chief 
Syrian negotiator Muwaffaq al-'Allaf lasted approximately 90 
minutes and dealt primarily with procedural issues. Rabinovich 
opened the discussion by expressing condolences on behalf of the 
Israeli Government over the death of Basil al-Asad, son of the 
Syrian president. Rabinovich later sought to discuss future 
security arrangements on the Golan Heights. It was reported 
that no progress was made on this matter and that there was no 
change in the Syrian positions. [passage omitted] 
  The peace talks on the other tracks were scheduled to resume 
at around midnight, Israel time. Upon arrival in Washington, 
Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation to the talks 
with Jordan, said that he had brought detailed plans to fill the 
Jordanian-Israeli agenda with content in order to help transform 
it into a real peace agreement. Rubinstein was accompanied by 
experts in the fields of water, environmental studies, and 
economics. 
  Major General Dani Rothschild heads the Israeli team to the 
talks with the Palestinians. Rothschild is supposed to 
negotiate opposite Sa'ib 'Urayqat, his Palestinian counterpart. 
Rothschild reiterated the prime minister's position that no 
progress can be made at the Washington talks before the problems 
holding back the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho First 
agreement are resolved. The Washington talks on the Palestinian 
track will focus on election modalities in the territories and 
the powers of the autonomy council. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mr. Muwaffaq al-'Allaf, Syria's chief delegate to 
the Washington talks, has reiterated the parameters of the 
Syrian position underscored by President Hafiz al-Asa at the 
Geneva talks with President Bill Clinton. Mr. al-'Allaf 
underlined the need for a settlement embracing all Arab fronts 
and Syria's rejection of any proposals that do not provide for 
the entire Golan Heights to be handed back to Syria. 
  At last night's session with his Israeli counterpart Itamar 
Rabinovich, al-'Allaf outlined the Geneva summit proceedings and 
developments since.

<F P=106> [Report by Caroline Faraj] </F>
  [Text] Heads of the Arab and Israeli delegations 
participating in the bilateral peace negotiations are continuing 
their consultations and coordination meetings to discuss the 
possibility of holding the next round of talks at the U.S. State 
Department. 
  As State Department Deputy Spokesman Christine Shelly said 
on 
Monday [24 January], the talks on the level of heads of 
delegations will continue over the next few days. 
  Reached by telephone in Washington, Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, 
Jordanian ambassador to the United States and head of the 
Jordanian delegation to the bilateral talks, told AL-RA'Y: 
Yesterday's talks were held separately with the head of each 
delegation. My meeting with chief Israeli delegate Elyaqim 
Rubenstein lasted only 15 minutes. It was a preparation for 
what we may discuss in the coming days. 
  Dr. al-Tarawinah stressed that on the second day of talks 
with the Israeli side, which will be held at the U.S. Department 
of State, the Jordanian side will concentrate on the clauses of 
the joint Jordanian-Israeli agenda, which was signed on 14 
September 1993. He said: As heads of delegations, we cannot 
discuss the details. Therefore, talks will be confined to the 
agenda and to the way we can proceed along the track in the same 
past order, that is, in the presence of the three working 
groups--the water, environment, and energy group; the refugees 
and economy group; and the security and border group. Dr. 
al-Tarawinah added: When the Arabs collectively decide to begin 
the next round of talks, these groups will discuss topics on the 
Jordanian-Israeli agenda all at once and in a manner that will 
cover all topics. 
  Asked if Jordan will prioritize its talks with the Israelis 
by beginning with the simple issues and avoiding the 
controversial ones, he said: We try to avoid prioritization. 
The three joint working groups will discuss all issues 
pertaining to each committee. All in all, these issues cover all 
topics of the agenda. These discussions will take place at the 
same time because all the agenda topics are important for Jordan. 
  He stressed that the date of the next round has not yet been 
discussed between the heads of delegations and the U.S. 
Administration, which is sponsoring the talks. 
  The State Department deputy spokesman had earlier said talks 
between the heads of the Arab and Israeli delegations are 
informal, but more feasible as the parties can probe each 
other's ideas away from pressure.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Jan (MENA)--Secret talks opened this 
evening between a Palestinian and Israeli delegation on 
implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The Palestinian delegation includes Ahmad Quray', alias 
Abu-'Ala', the head of the PLO Economic Department; Dr. Nabil 
Sha'th, Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser; Sa'id Kamal, the 
Palestinian ambassador in Cairo; and Zuhdi al-Qidrah, Fatah's 
representative in Cairo. 
  The Israeli delegation includes Yuri Savir, director general 
of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and Yo'el Singer, legal adviser 
at the Foreign Ministry. 
  Palestinian sources close to the meeting have stated that 
the 
talks, which have just started, might postpone the work of the 
Security and Civilian Affairs Committees due to be held in Taba; 
they could even replace them. 
  The Israeli delegation is carrying Yitzhaq Rabin's reply to 
the Palestinian paper that Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa carried to 
Israel on resolving differences regarding the implementation of 
the self-government agreement in Gaza and Jericho. 
  The talks are likely to continue tomorrow, probably until 
Thursday [27 January]. Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat is 
following the talks, which are being held in a hotel in the 
Heliopolis suburb, a few meters from his residence at the 
al-Andalus Palace.

<F P=106> [Ibrahim Humaydi report: "'Abd-al-Majid Tells AL-HAYAH: </F>
1994 Year of Peace in Region; Israel Will Withdraw Completely 
From Golan, Southern Lebanon"] 
  [Excerpts] Damascus -- Arab League Secretary General Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has stressed that 1994 will be the year of 
peace in the region, "even though I do not know the mechanism of 
the negotiation" between the Arab and Israeli delegations. And 
that Israel will withdraw from the occupied Arab territories." 
He pointed out that the Arab states are agreed on the principle 
of reconciliation among themselves and that the issue of lifting 
the Arab boycott of Israel will be referred to the Arab League 
Council in March at a request from U.S. Commerce Secretary 
Ronald Brown because of the U.S. companies' support for the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement, which 'Abd-al-Majid believes a 
"preliminary" step toward peace. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said in a statement to AL-HAYAH that the 
Arab boycott still stands with regard to Israel, "because its 
causes still exist, namely its occupation of Arab territories." 
  He pointed out that U.S. Secretary Brown asked the Arab 
League to lift the third-degree boycott by U.S. companies that 
played a role in bolstering the Gaza-Jericho agreement in the 
context of the U.S. aid for the agreement. The "issue will be 
referred to the Arab League Council, because it was the council 
which issued the boycott decision, hence only it can revoke it." 
However, he stressed that the U.S. secretary did not broach the 
Arab boycott of Israel, which is classified as first degree, 
"and the Arab League Council is free to take the right decision, 
and we understand the U.S. request." [passage omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Majid said that peace "will be established this 
year, 
but I do not know the negotiation mechanism for me to say 
exactly when." He stressed that he has "no doubt at all that 
Israel will withdraw completely from the Golan, and from 
southern Lebanon as well." [passage omitted] 
  On Arab reconciliation the Arab League secretary general 
said 
that all Arab states are agreed on the reconciliation 
principles. "But some of them say it is not the right time and 
we need some measures." He said that the "the countdown for the 
dispute has begun, and reconciliation is a sensitive issue in 
every Arab country. However, there has to be openness for the 
sake of reconciliation, which is not impossible." [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [By Nadim Kawash] </F>
  [Text] Abu Dhabi, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Arab economic reforms 
have failed to stop a steady flight of capital from the region 
due to inadequate financial policies and weak stock markets, a 
senior Arab economic official said on Tuesday [25 January]. 
  As a result, overseas assets by the 22 Arab League members 
have far surpassed their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at a time 
when they badly need funds to finance reforms, said Usamah 
al-Faqih, chairman of the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF). 
  By the end of 1992, Arab investments abroad, mainly in Japan 
and the West, exceeded 650 billion dollars while the combined 
Arab GDP stood at a round 450 billion dollars, he told a 
conference on Arab economic reforms here. 
  "Despite economic achievements made in some Arab countries 
due to the reform programmes and efforts being exerted in 
others, our stock markets still need a comprehensive structural 
development," he said. 
  "There is a general weakness in the legislative and 
organisational structures in the markets as well as the absence 
of secondary exchanges, market-makers and qualified personnel in 
the financial, auditing and legal functions associated with the 
stock markets." 
  Only 10 of the Arab states have official exchanges but 
activity in such markets have remained relatively small due to 
political instability in some members and lack of incentives and 
information about trading institutions. 
  In the oil-rich Gulf, turnover in most of the stock markets 
is among the lowest in the region due to high government 
ownership, a tendency for long-term investment and restriction 
of dealing to nationals. 
  Egypt, Jordan, Algeria, Morocco and other Arab nations have 
embarked on reforms to heal their economic problems, mainly 
large foreign debt, slow growth, low investment, unemployment 
and deficits in their budgets and balance of payments. The four 
countries owe more than 70 percent of the total Arab debt of 
over 150 billion dollars. 
  The problems have persisted though Arab states have received 
more than 370 billion dollars in loans and other forms of cash 
over the past two decades. Experts blamed instability, 
mismanagment of funds and state control. 
  Al-Faqih, a Saudi, said his Abu Dhabi-based Fund was setting 
up a data base to link Arab stock markets, where around 1,100 
banks and companies trade their shares, with a market 
capitalisation of 35 billion dollars in 1992. 
  He said the base, which would provide information on trading 
institutions in all member states, would start operation this 
year. He urged Arabs to step up reforms and those without stock 
markets to open floors. 
  "Despite reforms by some members, chronic deficits in the 
internal and external balances remain an obstacle for growth, 
and even stability, in Arab economies, with the latest figures 
showing the deficit in Arab budgets reaching around 15 percent 
of the GDP," he said. 
  "This underscores the need for redressing financial policies 
and developing stock markets in the Arab world in order to 
create a framework capable of attracting national and foreign 
investment and stimulating the private sector to play a greater 
role in economic and social development." 
  United Arab Emirates (UAE) minister of state for financial 
and industrial Affairs Ahmad al-Tayir, who opened the two-day 
conference, said financial policies in the region needed to be 
improved to ensure the success of reforms and cushion foreign 
influences on the domestic economy. 
  "Arab states, including those in the Gulf, should give 
financial instruments a greater role in economic growth and in 
reducing the impact of foreign factors like the decline in 
demand for their exports," he said. "This could not be done 
without upgrading their stock markets."

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" to AL-ITTIHAD] </F>
  [Text] Cairo -- AL-ITTIHAD has learned that, during his 
meeting with the irrigation ministers of the Nile basin 
countries at the end of their technical meetings in the Egyptian 
capital, Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa discussed the 
political aspect of the Nile water issue, particularly some 
basin countries' cooperation with Israel in water and irrigation 
projects. The foreign minister voiced special interest in what 
is taking place in Ethiopia and Kenya, where a considerable 
number of Israeli irrigation and dam experts are working. He 
proposed that Egypt provide the two countries with Egyptian 
experts. 
  Musa told the ministers that, despite peace and 
reconciliation between Egypt and Israel, it is not in the basin 
countries' interest to permit external parties to tamper with 
the Nile waters. 
  He explained that under no circumstances would Egypt 
tolerate 
any harm to its water resources because this is "a life or death 
issue" for Egypt. Therefore, he added, it is better for experts 
from Egyptian and the other Nile basin countries to cooperate to 
implement projects in these countries, as such a cooperation 
will ensure the interests of the countries in which projects are 
implemented, as well as those of Egypt in which the Nile river 
ends. Employing Israeli or European experts, he said, may open 
the door for foreign interests to play a destructive role in the 
water issue. 
  The Egyptian foreign minister pointed out that his country 
had informed all parties involved, including Israel and the big 
powers, that the Nile waters issue is not a subject of any 
Middle East multilateral negotiations or any Middle East 
cooperation in the water area and that it concerns no one except 
the basin countries themselves. 
  In another development, Egyptian Irrigation Minister 
Engineer 
'Abd-al-Hadi Radi told AL-ITTIHAD that alleged reports from 
Khartoum, or other capitals, on Sudan requesting new 
negotiations on sharing the Nile water by Egypt and Sudan are 
absolutely unfounded.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hasan al-Turaybi, general secretary of the </F>
Arab-Islamic People's Conference, by Pierre Darcourt in 
Khartoum; date not given -- first two paragraphs are LE FIGARO 
introduction] 
  [Text] The Manshiyah district of Khartoum, in the eastern 
part of the Sudanese capital. A sober building bedecked with 
bright red bougainvilleas. This is the home of Shaykh Hasan 
al-Turaybi, general secretary of the Arab Islamic People's 
Conference. The man the Western chancelleries, Egypt, and Saudi 
Arabia accuse of "leading a veritable Islamic International from 
the Middle East to the Maghreb," led us into a drawing room with 
walls covered with verses from the Koran. His slender figure 
was wrapped in a wide white galabiyah, his bronzed face framed 
with a neatly trimmed gray beard, his head covered with a silky 
turban, his smile was dazzling and his eyes sparkling with 
intelligence. 
  During three hours of conversation, this linguist who is 
regarded as an authority among well-read people in the Muslim 
world, spoke in excellent French interspersed with unexpected 
signs of humor. It is difficult to imagine that this affable, 
erudite person, holder of a masters' degree from Oxford 
University and a doctorate in law from the Sorbonne, should be 
regarded as one of the most dangerous men in the world, the 
leader of a "new empire of evil" in Washington's eyes. 
  [Darcourt] Who are you, Shaykh al-Turaybi? 
  [Al-Turaybi] It is for you to choose. For my enemies I am 
the "green devil," the "guru" of Islamic extremism. For my 
friends, I am Shaykh al-Turaybi, a title which the Sudanese 
confer on a man of age and knowledge, a man of religion. To 
understand better who I am, I must talk about my background. I 
was born on 1 February 1932 in Kassala in north-east Sudan, a 
village close to the Ethiopian border, by a whim of the 
itinerant career of my father, who for 30 years had the job of 
qadi, or Muslim judge. My father had graduated from the faculty 
of religious sciences in Omdurman, which explains my attraction 
to Koranic and legal studies. 
  Our family is descended from a famous line of religious 
dignitaries. My ancestor Daf'allah, a renowned sufi, created a 
Koranic school in the center of the country, frequented by many 
disciples, and founded the village of Turaybi which has born his 
name for 300 years. My wife Wisal al-Madi is the direct 
descendant of Muhammad Ahmad, the Great Madi, who swept the 
British troops from Khartoum in 1885. It was during those 
terrible assaults that Gordon, British governor general of 
Sudan, was killed. The Madi had called on his faithful, the 
al-Ansar, to fight against "the foreign infidels and the impious 
Turks" to establish in Sudan the kingdom of God based on the 
precepts of the Koran. The first Sudanese nationalism was born 
with him. 
  [Darcourt] You studied abroad for seven years. Which 
impressed you most, Britain or France? 
  [Al-Turaybi] France, without any doubt. I spent two years 
in Britain. Long enough to complete a master's degree and no 
more. And I continued my studies in Paris. At that time, going 
to France was already an act of independence in opposition to 
the British colonialists. The whole Sudanese elite was then 
focused on London. English was still the official state 
language. I stayed in France from 1959 to 1964. My wife was 
with me and speaks excellent French. We have six children and 
our first son was born in Paris. During my stay, I was struck 
by the courtesy of the teachers and the comradeship of the 
students. There was no segregation. I was excited by the 
richness and precision of the French language, the culture, the 
history of the revolution, the relations between church and 
state, and the study of the different constitutions. I was not 
focused exclusively on my law studies. I went to the national 
library, I visited museums. During the university vacations, I 
went to Strasbourg, Toulouse, and Albi, to Germany, and Italy. 
I think that the world is like a book of which you have only 
read the first page until you have left your own country. 
  [Darcourt] How did you enter politics? 
  [Al-Turaybi] My first public engagement was to launch a 
campaign for the emancipation of Sudanese women and to give them 
the right to vote. I thought that they should play a full part 
in building a new Islamic society, well-anchored in its century. 
They also needed to be taken from the exclusive confinement to 
domestic tasks. It was a difficult enterprise, but those 
reforms succeeded. 
  [Darcourt] You are the founder of the Arab-Islamic 
People's Conference, which holds its congress in Khartoum each 
year. Are you satisfied with its work? 
  [Al-Turaybi] The scale of this meeting is a unique event in 
history. More than 500 delegates representing 56 countries from 
four continents -- Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America -- 
took part in it. Nobody was excluded. Among the delegates were 
around 20 leaders of the Sunni clergy; muftis from Bosnia, 
Greece, and Albania; the rector of the Grand Mosque in Paris; 
German imams; several mullahs; imams from the United States, and 
others -- Belgians, Spanish, French -- many women; and even 12 
American bishops in the framework of the Church-Islam dialogue 
which we launched last year. This conference primarily aimed to 
mobilize the largest number of groups and prominent individuals 
to reconcile the Muslims divided among the four corners of the 
world and unite them in face of those who are relentlessly 
hostile to them. Consensus was reached on a firm will: To 
raise the idea of God in face of American society in which the 
supremacy of commercial materialism backed by an overwhelming 
military power leaves room for no faith in divine law. 
  [Darcourt] During the conference, the United States was 
clearly named as "Islam's mortal enemy..." 
  [Al-Turaybi] The arrogance of the United States which has 
become the only world superpower offends us. It subjects 
countries which refuse to bow to its diktats to a harsh economic 
blockade. This is true of Sudan, which is deprived of all 
development aid, and blacklisted for "violation of human rights 
and collaboration with terrorist organizations." 
  [Darcourt] This is also true of Libya... 
  [Al-Turaybi] The situation is different. Nobody is accusing 
us of having blown up airplanes, and we respect the embargo. 
Colonel al-Qadhdhafi has been in power for a quarter of a 
century. He started his national socialist revolution inspired 
by al-Nasir, then he launched his revolution of the Little Green 
Book. He apparently no longer believes in it. His current 
preoccupation is to unite the tribes. But the Americans are 
stepping up the pressure on his entourage and will continue to 
stifle Libya. This is only a remark, but al-Qadhdhafi is likely 
to end up in the next cell to General Noriega, the former 
dictator of Panama. 
  [Darcourt] Sudan is regarded as one of the hubs of 
international terrorism... 
  [Al-Turaybi] These accusations are unfounded. Sudan, 
devastated by a civil war which has been going on for 10 years 
and which is costing it $1 million per day, does not have the 
money or material resources to maintain guerrillas abroad in 
Egypt or Algeria. On the other hand, where U.S. interests lie, 
attacks on democracy are never condemned. Take the example of 
Saudi Arabia: It is a country without a constitution in which 
nobody votes, governed for more than 60 years by an absolute 
monarchy, the king and...3,500 princes of the blood covered with 
dollars. For the Americans, Saudi Arabia, the main holder of 
the world's crude oil reserves, is an untouchable preserve. 
  [Darcourt] France was not attacked once during the 
conference... 
  [Al-Turaybi] We have no complexes about France. It did not 
colonize Sudan. France has major assets for becoming the 
preferred interlocutor of the Muslim peoples once again -- its 
feeling for law, its influence in Africa, its knowledge of the 
Arab world, and its advanced technology. We are happy that our 
government chose Air France, and not British Airways, to serve 
Khartoum; Paris, and not London, as the main stop; and that 
Sudan Airways, our national company, bought Airbus planes and 
not Boeings. 
  [Darcourt] Among the delegations invited to the conference 
were several members of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], of 
whom Abdallah Hannas was the spokesman. The FIS' armed groups 
are stepping up summary executions of foreigners on Algerian 
territory... 
  [Al-Turaybi] This conflict is starting in the same way as 
the FLN's [National Liberation Front] Algerian war, by 
assassinations, outbreaks of violence, and very harsh police 
repression. Every time I met a member of the FIS I always said 
to him: "Have you spoken with France?" He replied: "Out of the 
question." I insisted: "You must talk, open a dialogue. Your 
country is in danger of breaking up. If you come to power by 
force, 3 million or even 4 million Algerians will probably flee 
like boat people to the French coast." 
  France, already disturbed by the problem of immigrants, will 
not be able to receive them. This chaos must be avoided, a 
compromise must be found, and an agreement reached. For the 
time being, you see, these armed groups are not controlled, the 
FIS is a passionate movement without a precise program and not 
yet structured. The first line is harsh. The second line is 
intelligent. After two years of discussion, I have been able to 
persuade them to talk with France and the FLN. Serious contacts 
have taken place in Germany, in the United States, and in Sudan. 
The civil war is a bad fever which must be brought down at all 
costs.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Husni Mubarak marking Egyptian Police </F>
Day at the Police Academy in Cairo -- live] 
  [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
Dear brothers and sons, soldiers, and officers of the police: 
  It was not strange for the Egyptian police to choose one of 
the greatest days of national struggle to mark its day and for 
us to remember the sacrifices of honorable men who gave their 
lives in the line of duty. They defended their position to the 
last man to make this day a national holiday for all Egypt, a 
day that elevates the value of duty, shows the meaning of 
sacrifice, and emphasizes the determination of a people to stand 
fast. 
  The steadfastness of a limited number of policemen in 
Ismailia on 25 January 1952 against the foreign occupation 
forces and their courageous resistance of the aggression until 
the end was a glorious chapter in the epic of our national 
struggle. They stood fast in the face of military forces 
equipped with all types of heavy weapons. They chose to die 
defending their small post to show the steadfastness of all 
Egypt in the face of the occupation's arrogance and violence. 
They were a splendid symbol of the steadfastness of a nation 
that rejects submission and surrender. They were an eternal 
example of a splendid national courage that rejects coercion and 
violence. They were a true embodiment of a great Egyptian call 
to defend the dignity and honor of the homeland. 
  The Egyptian police chose this great day in the history of 
Egyptian patriotism to emphasize the meaning of devotion and 
sacrifice and to emphasize the commitment of this longtime 
national institution to the objectives of national struggle. 
Policemen are a part of the fiber of this people. Their duty 
is to defend the people's hopes and aspirations; guard the 
security of every citizen; protect citizens' honor, freedom, and 
property; safeguard the country's stability; maintain respect 
for the law; restrain the oppressor; assist the needy; defend 
society against the evils of outlaws; and fight illegal 
profiteers, drug traffickers, mishandlers of the people's 
interests, and those who dare to tamper with the country's 
security and stability. 
  This sublime and noble message is not easy to carry out. 
Only those who are able to give of themselves and sacrifice can 
shoulder its burdens and difficulties, those who are ready to 
sacrifice for the sake of the country, those who do not hesitate 
to confront the most difficult dangers to defend the security of 
every citizen, and those who compete to sacrifice their lives to 
fulfill their duty. 
  The sacrifices of Egyptian policemen, represented by the 
events of January 1995, are continuing every day in numerous 
forms of heroism and sacrifice while defending the people's 
right to a secure and stable country, which should be not 
affected by the designs of a deviated and blinded group. This 
group has launched a war against its country, destroying its 
economy, undermining its interests, and killing and wounding 
many innocent victims without any restraint from religion or 
conscience. 
  Righteous police officers and soldiers have been martyred. 
They have offered their blood to defend the right of every 
Egyptian to a safe homeland that protects his present and 
future. Some of them were martyred in confrontations sparked by 
the growing criminal inclinations of those groups. Others were 
treacherously martyred, fired at while going about their daily 
business only because of their affiliation with a national 
agency whose primary responsibility is to maintain the 
homeland's security and stability. 
  Brothers and sons, police officers, and soldiers: I am fully 
confident that all of Egypt is joining us today as we celebrate 
a national day associated, in history and meaning, with the 
sacrifices of honorable men who were, and still are, pioneers in 
confrontation and sacrifice. They are doing all they can to 
confront an imminent danger that is laying in wait for the 
future of the homeland, a danger linked to the conspiracies of 
known foreign forces that do not want Egypt to have stability or 
progress, forces that use local individuals and groups whose 
conscience is blind to the interests of the homeland. 
  Society has discovered the truth of the police prediction 
made long ago that those groups seek to impoverish Egypt and 
hinder its progress in favor of foreign forces that want our 
country to remain burdened with the problems of unemployment, 
poverty, and a lack of job and investment opportunities so that 
it will not contribute to human progress. 
  First and foremost, those groups are a tool of sabotage and 
destruction. Their other role is to block Egypt's democratic 
march and undermine the achievements of successive Egyptian 
generations that have struggled throughout history to turn this 
homeland into a beacon of faith and a torch of science and 
culture. Their aim is to frighten and force darkness onto the 
mind of the nation and turn the homeland into a large prison, 
where there is no place for opposition or debate and no room for 
divergent views or opinions except under guillotines. 
  The objectives of those groups have been revealed. They rid 
themselves of any deterrent from religion or conscience and 
continue with their growing criminal inclination, committing 
extremely shameful and horrible acts. Their true face has been 
flagrantly exposed to all: They are merely hired gangs shedding 
the blood of innocent people and violating the interests of the 
majority of our silent people. They kill for the sake of 
killing, unconcerned with the fall of scores of innocent victims. 
  Police officers have never hesitated to confront the groups 
of terrorists. They have waged the confrontation battle boldly 
and courageously, enjoying the support of a great nation that 
has realized the dimensions and dangers of the conspiracy. The 
people have strongly supported their police officers, protecting 
their backs, blessing their efforts, and helping them as much as 
they could. 
  The people have helped chase the culprits and have led 
police to the dens of saboteurs. At the decisive moments, the 
people have closed their ranks in calling for uprooting 
terrorists, who seek to impoverish Egypt, destroy its national 
economy, and disrupt its security for external goals and do not 
care about the interests of the homeland or the people. The 
masses have closed their ranks while paying tribute to victims 
from the police and the people, openly announcing their decision 
to confront terrorism, the enemy of God and the homeland, while 
condemning its abominable crimes and raising their voices 
against its atrocities, which run contrary to heavenly messages 
and human values, target innocent victims, and waste the 
homeland's present and future. 
  This increasing cohesion between the people and the police 
in 
the face of terrorist groups shows whoever has vision and 
insight that terrorism has no future on this good and tolerant 
soil, that it is inevitably doomed to fail and recede, and that 
it will remain isolated and besieged until it is uprooted. 
Terrorism has no future on this ancient land because its 
abominable deeds and crimes are carried out by aberrant groups 
that have broken away from the national unanimity. They are at 
odds with the spirit of the people, run contrary to the people's 
nature, and undermine their interests. A minority who is 
isolated from the national mainstream will not be able to 
humiliate the will of the people or dictate to this noble nation 
a fate that has nothing to offer but ignorance, despotism, 
oppression, and poverty. 
  Brothers and sons: The Egyptian people's decision to side 
with their police marks a decisive development in the 
confrontation with the phenomenon of terrorism because the 
security of any homeland cannot be fully and properly attained 
without cooperation between the people and the police in 
combating crime, exposing corruption, and uncovering criminals. 
The awareness of each citizen of his responsibility for the 
security of the country and his realization of the importance of 
assisting police officers in their mission will ensure stability 
in every part of the country, broaden the respect for the law, 
and keep crime to a minimum. No matter how capable the state 
may be in intensifying security measures on Egyptian streets, it 
has limits that are difficult to go beyond. Police cannot put a 
security guard in every part of the country, but each citizen 
could contribute toward maintaining the security of the 
neighborhood he lives in. By doing this we could contain 
terrorism in limited areas that are easy to narrow down. 
Cooperation between the police and people is important because 
of several other factors. The most important factor is that it 
is the duty of the police to provide security for each Egyptian 
and that police officers are part of the people and are doing 
their duty toward their families. 
  We all must remember that security is not just the 
responsibility of the regime or of those in charge of it. It is 
also the responsibility of each citizen to help protect his 
livelihood, honor, children, life, and property. It is the 
responsibility of society now and in the future. 
  Brothers and sisters. The arm of the state is strong and 
capable of uprooting the terrorist elements in the quickest time 
possible. But we do not want to invalidate the rule of the law 
and we refuse to bypass our national commitment to let our ways 
and means of combating terrorism remain confined to the 
framework that protects our democratic choice. 
  Police behavior toward the enemies of the homeland will 
remain civilized and governed by the rule of law and will remain 
above the methods of revenge. The police will not punish anyone 
for a crime committed by someone else but will put the whole 
matter into the hands of a fair and honest judiciary that is not 
subject to any authority other than conscience and the law. 
  The recent terrorist incidents that aimed to frighten 
society 
and to destroy the homeland's structures could have been the 
excuse for stringent emergency measures that strengthen the 
police force's ability to confront the terrorist elements and 
cut short the time needed for the confrontation. But we refused 
to do this out of respect for the rule of law, the authority of 
the judiciary, and human rights. We refused to do so out of 
belief in the ability of the democratic course to confront 
terrorism if all the efforts of society combine to confront this 
phenomenon and the political responsibility of the parties and 
the national action institutions rise to the level of commitment 
to the homeland's supreme interests. This great cooperation 
between the police and the people is now available. 
  The fact is that some of our national parties have taken a 
step in the right direction. They condemn terrorism and 
strongly call for eliminating its lairs, causes, and roots. 
Only some of the enemies of democracy, who still hide behind 
false slogans that propagate terrorist ideas and actions, have 
remained outside this national consensus. 
  Brothers, before the referendum on the new term of office, I 
called for a statewide national dialogue in which all national 
parties and forces take part in order to define clearly the 
priorities of national action in light of the circumstances and 
the challenges that the homeland is going through. My objective 
from this dialogue -- and it is still my objective -- is to 
reach a national agreement that will position the issue of 
security and stability correctly among the national action 
priorities because society will not have the opportunity to 
advance along the course of economic or social reform in the 
absence of stability. Stability is the basis and the support 
for a democratic and capable homeland that is not distracted 
from continuing its progress by ambition, the chaos of 
conflicts, or the struggle between forces. 
  In my comprehensive speech at the recent opening of the 
People's Assembly's parliamentary session following the 
referendum, I urged that the objectives of the national dialogue 
should extend to include a scientific, objective, and 
comprehensive concept of Egypt's future at the start of the 21st 
century. My aim has been and still is that this comprehensive 
concept should lead to a widely based national accord committed 
to the homeland's supreme interests and rallies the efforts of 
all forces behind the homeland's strategic objectives about 
which there can be no argument. The political parties, national 
forces, public action establishments, intellectuals, and those 
who care about the homeland's future responded positively to the 
call for a national dialogue. I believe that this dialogue 
could be a good opportunity to achieve a comprehensive vision 
that goes beyond our narrow party interests, places our national 
priorities in their right place, and draws the dividing lines 
that no one should go beyond for the sake of protecting this 
homeland's interests. 
  We are not trying to remove the differences among the 
various parties, nor do we want to abolish points of divergence 
in their views and programs. It is in divergent programs and 
views that the meaning of democracy lies. In essence, democracy 
is a dialogue between opposing views to attain the truth or 
agree on common objectives. 
  From this national dialogue, we do not seek to abolish 
differences in views, but we call for respecting the priorities 
and principles of the democratic action, which suppose a minimum 
level of agreement among the various parties on the homeland's 
high interests when it faces one of its main challenges. 
  Brothers and sons, police officers and soldiers: We are not 
the only ones suffering from terrorism. In many countries, 
there are terrorist groups led by disobedient ones, mutineers, 
and outlaws. Despair eroded their souls, and frozen minds 
prevented them from keeping up with the developments of the age. 
They were turned into a destructive force against their 
homelands. They wanted to obstruct society, antagonize history, 
and move backward to escape the burdens of the future. 
  But these groups soon disappear without achieving anything. 
They are scattered remnants that do not represent a basic trend 
in society. Perhaps the difference between one particular 
situation and another lies in the ability of each society to 
prepare itself to confront the phenomenon through firm, 
unwavering national unanimity--one that does not tolerate 
ambiguity or compromise, and is not spoiled by a sinful desire 
to use the situation to achieve small party interests, often at 
the expense of the society. 
  I do not need to stress the importance of our national 
consensus on the issue of stability. The message of security 
and stability is never separable from the message of economic 
and political construction. Without stability, it is impossible 
for democracy or the economy to flourish, and it is impossible 
for us to aspire to a strong state capable of meeting its 
people's demands. 
  This is the fact that we must keep before our eyes; it is a 
fact that cannot tolerate denial or one-upmanship. I am 
confident that the wave of terrorism will recede and vanish in 
the face of our national consensus and the determination of the 
great Egyptian people to eradicate this phenomenon. Then, Egypt 
will continue the march of construction and development, more 
strongly and vigorously, under a safe and stable umbrella where 
investment capabilities are redoubled, the tourism boom is 
restored, new projects are spread over every inch of this 
homeland, and all efforts are devoted to a fair and continuing 
development that takes into consideration Egypt's less-developed 
geographic regions and the slums most in need of services. 
  The wave of terrorism will be broken and will disappear 
through the sacrifices of the heroic men who offered their dear 
souls so that this homeland will remain, as it has always been, 
safe and stable, built by the hands of its virtuous sons--hands 
that do not know destruction, only construction. The country 
will continue its message as a beacon of light and culture, with 
a history that has produced a succession of intellectuals, 
thinkers, creative people, and esteemed ulema and judges. They 
have been the conscience of this nation, spreading the values of 
justice, enlightenment, and support for life. 
  The sacrifices of these martyrs will remain a beacon 
exuding the values of sacrifice and loyalty, embodying the 
offerings of brave men who defended the people's right to live, 
and immortalizing the loyalty of a great people who will 
continue to remember with gratitude their heroic and innocent 
sons. Greetings to the policemen who continue to offer 
sacrifices in defense of the security of every citizen. 
Greetings to their innocent martyrs who offered their souls to 
redeem a homeland aspiring to security, stability, and progress. 
Greetings to other martyr citizens who treacherously fell 
victim to abominable crimes, including innocent children in the 
age of flowers, youths who were sources of hope for their 
relatives and homeland, and ordinary innocent Egyptians. 
  Brothers, the forces of treachery and darkness cannot 
undermine this high edifice built by the Egyptian people with 
their sweat, sacrifice, and struggle. The Egyptians have 
realized great construction and progress, which will not be 
obstructed by terrorist crimes that the whole people have 
denounced when they discovered they are seeking to ruin this 
edifice and squander the homeland's interests. We have agreed 
on building a free and democratic society that respects the 
right to disagreement within the framework of a real multi-party 
system and that gives full opportunity for opinion and 
counter-opinion. The achievement of this goal has not been easy 
under the difficult circumstances that could have eroded our 
nascent democracy. However, we have stood fast and fought. We 
now have a correct democracy, the course of which is being 
strengthened day by day. This democracy is based on a 
multi-party system, a free press, and an independent judiciary. 
We have agreed on establishing a society capable of fulfilling 
the people's demands and harnessing their resources. This 
society is pervaded by mutual confidence and does not deny the 
opportunity for participation to any citizen. The achievement 
of this goal has not been easy in a society governed by vestiges 
and shackles trying to pull it backward and squander its 
strength. 
  We now have a society capable of shouldering the burdens of 
the future, a society that opens the doors of participation for 
whoever wants to enter, and that accepts any contribution that 
increases its strength and potential. We have agreed to build a 
society not governed by the complexes of the past. This society 
looks forward to the future, upholds a just peace, seeks to 
reclaim its pioneer position in the world, and extends bridges 
of cooperation to all. The achievement of this goal has not been 
easy in an Arab and international climate permeated by 
apprehensions and doubts. We now have an open society that has 
relations with all states and that plays its vanguard role in 
the Arab world as a force for justice and solidarity. It 
spreads the umbrella of peace over the whole region. It lifts 
Egypt's banners high. 
  We have agreed to build a strong state having a national 
deterrent force, thus preserving the homeland's destiny and 
protecting its peace and security. Achieving this goal has not 
been easy in difficult economic conditions. We now have armed 
forces capable of undertaking their national tasks, defending 
peace and participating with rare efficiency in preserving 
national security and world peace. 
  Officers and men, let us be confident that falsehood will 
retreat because truth is bound to triumph and falsehood cannot 
survive in a country full of light, riches, and faith that 
labors for a better future for its future generations. 
Falsehood will not stand a chance of surviving in this good and 
tolerant land. It will remain outcast and isolated and pursued 
by the people's anger and wrath until it recedes and disappears. 
  The wave of terrorism will retreat and break by virtue of 
the 
valiant men's courage and the awareness of a nation that cannot 
be deceived by falseness and perversion so that Egypt will 
become again, as it always has, a safe and secure country. This 
is Almighty God's promise. Peace and God's mercy be upon you. 
[applause]

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Jan (MENA)--Palestinian president Yasir 
'Arafat has praised President Husni Mubarak's efforts to 
surmount the obstacles to the prompt, sure implementation of the 
Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. 
  Following a two-hour meeting with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
today, 'Arafat said that the latest Egyptian effort in this 
regard was Musa's visit to Israel, where he discussed the 
outcome of the meeting in Oslo between 'Arafat and Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  'Arafat said President Mubarak and his foreign minister 
deserve credit and gratitude for their efforts, which have 
boosted the Palestinian cause. 
  We expect and hope to overcome the obstacles still facing 
the 
Declaration of Principles within the next few days, 'Arafat 
said. He added that important talks will be held tonight between 
Israeli officials who will arrive in Cairo tonight and the 
Palestinian delegation. The talks will continue tomorrow and 
may go into Thursday and Friday if needed. 
  'Arafat pointed out that Musa returned from Israel with 
important results. The Palestinian president said the Israeli 
delegation that will arrive tonight is the same delegation that 
accompanied Peres to the Oslo talks last week. 'Arafat said the 
Palestinian delegation is eager to see what the Israelis will 
bring to the Cairo talks. 
  On his visit to Saudi Arabia, 'Arafat said he was pleased 
with it and with the meeting he held with Saudi King Fahd, 
custodian of the two holy mosques. He described his talks with 
King Fahd as good, constructive, and positive. He said he 
explained everything that has been achieved in the peace talks 
and thanked the king for his efforts to stimulate the peace 
process. 
  The Palestinian president said he asked King Fahd to 
continue 
exerting efforts on the international, Arab, and regional levels 
on behalf of the Palestinian people, their cause, and the sacred 
cause of Jerusalem. 
  Musa said 'Arafat talked with President Mubarak on the 
telephone. And Mubarak was in constant touch with us during the 
talks we held tonight, he remarked. 
  The Egyptian foreign minister said the arrival of the 
Israeli 
delegation in Cairo tonight for talks with the Palestinian 
delegation to explore ways to overcome the remaining problems is 
a new and satisfactory development. 
  He revealed that he will meet 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign 
Minister Peres in Davos, Switzerland. Musa added that efforts 
to settle the remaining problems will continue in the next few 
days.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad 'Abd-al-Bari] </F>
  [Text] Investigations by the security organs have revealed 
that Samir Isma'il Salih, a Palestinian student attending 
al-Azhar Institute in al-Zaytun, had strong links with Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement]. "Coded" messages issued by the 
Hamas leadership in the occupied territories were found in 
Salih's possession. The messages contain instructions from 
Hamas for suicide operations to be waged against policemen in 
retaliation for what the group called repressive measures 
against brothers in jihad in Egypt. 
  A responsible security source told AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I's 
legal 
editor that preliminary information indicates a foreign security 
service has infiltrated Hamas and is steering it toward 
supporting to terrorists locked in armed confrontation with the 
Egyptian security organs, in an effort to destabilize Egypt. 
  The security source said that Hamas, while involved in 
supporting Egyptian terrorists, remains unaware of being 
infiltrated by the foreign security service. 
  The source disclosed that the raid on a terrorist stronghold 
in al-Ma'sarah [a southern suburb of Cairo] came after 
investigations showed that a number of individuals living in 
that area had been involved in attacks against policemen. 
  One notorious terrorist, Tharwat Hajjaj, however, managed to 
escape the police dragnet, together with his wife and three 
children. Two others, Muhammad Ahmad Farhan and Samir Salih, 
were captured. 
  The source added that the Egyptian security service had 
information showing Hamas' support of terrorists but lacked 
material evidence. The arrest of the Palestinian student 
provided us with that evidence, he stated. 
  [Cairo AL-JUMHURIYAH in Arabic on pp 1, 4 of its 22 January 
issue says: "A high-ranking security source has denied a press 
report on the involvement of a certain Palestinian organization 
in terrorist acts in Egypt. The source said that terrorist 
Samir Salih has been living in Cairo for some time and that 
terrorists succeeded in recruiting him."]

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Jan (MENA)--AL-AHRAM writes that the 
United Nations' efforts to disarm Iraq, which are part of the 
preparations to implement long-term monitoring of Iraq's 
armament, again raise the issue of controlling nuclear, 
conventional, and nonconventional armaments in the Middle East. 
  The paper recalls the Security Council resolutions that said 
disarming Iraq should be part of a process to rid the Middle 
East of all weapons of mass destruction and to establish a new 
security order in the region. 
  While acknowledging that the effort to control armaments in 
the region is primarily linked with an Arab-Israeli settlement, 
the paper, in its editorial today, adds that the part of these 
resolutions that has been implemented involves Iraq alone. 
  AL-AHRAM stresses that the Iraqi threat, which some parties 
used as an excuse in the past, no longer exists. It adds: 
Further, achieving progress in the efforts to control armaments 
will necessarily create a better climate for boosting the 
overall settlement process.

  [Excerpts] Most areas in southern Iraq are facing 
deteriorating security and economic conditions amid reports of 
escalating jihad operations by the Islamic resistance forces 
against the security and intelligence services of the tyrant 
Saddam. 
  Travelers from southern Iraq told our correspondent that 
al-Basrah and adjacent areas were recently the scene of jihad 
operations, which claimed the lives of several of the tyrant's 
security and ruling party officials, including a senior party 
official in al-Basrah. [passage omitted] 
  The travelers added that Islamic resistance fighters 
hijacked 
the car of the regime's interior minister and its driver in 
December 1993. Following this daring operation, they released 
the driver and asked him to convey a threatening message to the 
criminal Interior Minister Watban. [passage omitted] 
  According to our exclusive news reports, the regime of the 
tyrant Saddam has been imposing what looks like a military siege 
on Baghdad and its environs. Republican Guard brigades are 
deployed in al-Rashidiyah, al-Suwayrah, and along the road to 
al-Ramadi. 
  Our sources add that the regime's organs of oppression have 
conducted extensive arrests of innocent citizens since the 
beginning of January. Recently, the arrests were conspicuous in 
al-Hillah after this city was cordoned-off by Republican Guard 
brigades. The arrests were on a scale not seen the suppression 
of the eternal Sha'ban [March 1991] uprising.

Husnu Kaftan in Baghdad on 25 January -- recorded; in Arabic 
with superimposed translation into Turkish] 
  [Text] [Kaftan] Mr. Minister, the talks in connection 
with the Karkuk-Yumurtalik oil pipeline were held between the 
Turkish and Iraqi foreign ministry officials in Ankara on 8-9 
January. As you know, the UN resolutions still stand. How will 
this problem be resolved? 
  [Al-Sahhaf] As you know, the under secretaries of the 
Turkish and Iraqi Foreign Ministries met in Ankara upon the 
invitation of the Turkish side. The oil pipeline issue was 
particularly discussed during the Ankara talks. The crude oil 
in the pipeline must be emptied out and the pipeline must be 
refilled to prevent rotting and to maintain it. We have been 
suggesting this to the Turkish side for a long time. We should 
not wait any longer. Turkey suffered great economic loss 
because the pipeline was closed down. The international 
economic embargo imposed on Iraq greatly affected Turkey as 
well. Turkey suffered great damages. Turkey can extract 
certain resolutions from the United Nations to compensate for 
its losses.

  [Text] Jordanian Transport Minister Adib Halasah has 
affirmed that the Iraqi people's steadfastness under leader 
President Saddam Husayn in the face of the treacherous 30-state 
aggression has thwarted the imperialist-Zionist schemes to 
undermine Iraq's sovereignty and national unity. 
  During a meeting with the Babil deputy governor today, 
Halasah indicated that stepped-up hostile conspiracies against 
the march of great Iraq were the inevitable outcome of the 
growth of Iraq's pan- Arab role in the efforts to rehabilitate 
the Arab nation's values and principles and confront external 
ambitions in the region. 
  The Jordanian minister visited the historical city of 
Babylon 
and acquainted himself with its archaeological and historical 
sites.

continue to make base facilities available to American, British, 
and French aircraft to violate Iraqi airspace. A letter from 
Iraq's permanent Arab League delegate to its secretary general 
also points out that the action poses a serious threat to Iraq's 
sovereignty and national unity. 
  Last Friday, Saturday, and Sunday [21, 22, 23 January], 
these 
aircraft mounted 148 sorties, having taken off from Saudi and 
Kuwaiti bases. 
  Iraq's delegate asked that the letter be circulated among 
the

  [Text] Baghdad, Jan 26 (AFP) -- The UN's deputy disarmament 
chief on Wednesday wound up a "very productive" mission here to 
discuss long term monitoring of Iraq's weapons programme. 
  American Charles Duelfer, deputy head of the UN Special 
Commission (UNSCOM) disarming Iraq under Gulf War ceasefire 
resolutions, spent five days here preparing next week's visit by 
his boss Rolf Ekeus. 
  "The discussions have been very productive" on implementing 
Security Council Resolution 715, which orders long term 
monitoring of Iraq's weapons programme, Duelfer said as he left 
for New York via Cyprus. 
  The surveillance programme is the next UN step following the 
destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction after the Gulf 
war of January-February 1991. 
  Ekeus arrives next Wednesday to discuss long-term 
monitoring, 
but has said he is unlikely to recommend a lifting of sanctions 
before the end of the year. 
  Iraq has been lobbying hard for an end to the embargo 
imposed 
after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. 
  Duelfer had talks with General 'Amr Rashid, head of the 
military industrialisation organisation, and visited several 
military sites. 
  Setting up the monitoring "is a complicated procedure which 
will require the sustained efforts of both the government of 
Iraq and UNSCOM" he said. 
  "Iraq has provided additional detailed information on 
facilities which we are evaluating." 
  His talks here covered details of the monitoring, including 
inspections, sensors and cameras. 
  Iraq agreed to the surveillance in November after rejecting 
it for three years. 
  "Significant progress has beenb made and much remains to be 
done" Duelfer added. 
  A team of 16 inspectors led by Russian Nikita Smidovitch 
arrived with Duelfer on Friday for a 10 day inspection mission.

<F P=106> [Dispatch from Washington by unidentified correspondent] </F>
  [Excerpt] Washington is certain that the Arab-Israeli peace 
talks will resume. Despite the media blackout imposed by the 
U.S. State Department on the talks, the first meeting between 
heads of the Lebanese and Israeli delegations Suhayl Shammas and 
Uri Lubrani was tense because of Lubrani's remarks before the 
meeting. Lubrani reiterated the same Israeli stand, which 
sidesteps UN Resolution 425 and instead talks about a 
Lebanese-Israeli peace treaty. Ambassador Shammas once again 
voiced Lebanon's rejection of Israel's suggestion, adding that 
such remarks are bound to obstruct the U.S. endeavors to bridge 
the gap in views. 
  However, the second meeting between Shammas and Lubrani was 
more positive than the first. The heads of the Lebanese and 
Israeli negotiations got to the core of the talks. 
Specifically, they discussed the agenda of the coming round of 
talks scheduled for early next month. 
  According to reports leaked to our radio, the discussion 
focused in part on a possible mechanism to give momentum to 
bilateral negotiations in the coming round which, according to 
U.S. expectations, must be different from previous rounds in 
terms of the need to produce practical results. In this regard, 
the head of the Israeli delegation once again proposed the 
establishment of a Lebanese-Israeli joint military committee to 
discuss issues related to withdrawal and security in the border 
zone. 
  According to reports available to our radio, the Americans 
have a solution for this issue. It somewhat goes along with 
both the Lebanese and Israeli views. The U.S. draft solution 
could be summed up as follows: It goes along with Lebanon's 
demand while taking the Israeli position into consideration. In 
this regard, U.S. might provide guarantees of Israel's 
withdrawal from Lebanese territory, but it would be a phased 
withdrawal to gradually ensure security in the south. The last 
phase of Israel's withdrawal from the south would go hand in 
hand with the last phase of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan. 
  The U.S. proposal also goes along with Israel's demand, but 
it takes Lebanon's views into consideration. In this regard, 
committees may be formed, but they will not be called military 
or security committees. Instead, they will be called 
specialized committees and be composed of military and 
non-military figures and will be part of the negotiating teams 
and not separate from them. This is the U.S. draft solution that 
peace coordinator Dennis Ross may offer during a possible 
meeting with the heads of the Arab and Israeli delegations at 
the end of this week. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister al-Hariri will conclude his visit to 
Britain and return to Beirut in a few hours. He will attend a 
parliamentary debate tomorrow. In London yesterday, Prime 
Minister al-Hariri met with British Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd, who hosted a dinner in his honor. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri has urged Arab investors to invest 
in Lebanon. He told foreign reporters that Lebanon will not 
sign a peace agreement before Syria and Jordan do. He pointed 
out that there is an agreement with Damascus not to proceed 
separately. He noted that the issue of Syrian troops in Lebanon 
will be discussed in light of the results of the negotiations 
with Israel. Here is a dispatch from our correspondent in 
London, Khalil Fulayhan: 
  [Begin Fulayhan recording] Prime Minister al-Hariri has 
stated that if Yasir 'Arafat wishes to visit Lebanon, he should 
apply for an entry visa. The prime minister was answering a 
question during a news conference held last night at the Foreign 
Correspondents Club in London. 
  He was asked: How could 'Arafat be asked to apply for a visa 
to Lebanon and is Ahmad Jibril asked to do the same before he 
comes to Lebanon to inspect his troops? Prime Minister 
al-Hariri answered: I have not seen his passport. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri added that U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher had told him that the al-Asad-Clinton summit was 
successful and good, adding that he hopes 1994 will be a year of 
peace. Al-Hariri pointed out that resettling the Palestinians 
in Lebanon is impossible for us to accept, and this is a 
principled stand. 
  Asked if he was ready to meet Rabin after attempts to bring 
Rabin together with other Arab leaders have succeeded, Prime 
Minister al- Hariri said: This is not a personal issue. I am 
not ready to meet Rabin before a peace agreement is concluded. 
The Israelis must withdraw first, and then we can discuss the 
issue. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Muhammad Shuqayr report: "Al-Hariri Tells AL-HAYAH: Talks </F>
To Deal With Ways of Developing Cooperation"] 
  [Excerpts] Beirut -- Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri 
arrived in London yesterday as head of a ministerial delegation 
on the first official visit to Britain by a Lebanese prime 
minister since 1975. During his three-day visit al-Hariri will 
hold talks with senior British officials, first and foremost his 
British opposite number John Major. The talks will deal with 
political, economic, and reconstruction issues in addition to 
the possibility of contributing to bolstering the plan to equip 
the Lebanese Army and internal security forces. [passage 
omitted] 
  Before departing for London, Prime Minister al-Hariri told 
AL-HAYAH that he is going to discuss with senior British 
officials, first and foremost Major and competent ministers, in 
the presence of Lebanese ministers, aspects of cooperation 
between the two countries in various spheres in the light of the 
plan prepared by the Lebanese Government to rehabilitate vital 
facilities, proceeding from the plan to begin the development 
and rebuilding process. 
  The prime minister expects the talks to include current 
political issues, bilateral relations, and the stage reached in 
the peace talks in the Middle East region in the wake of the 
success achieved in the Syrian-U.S. summit held in Geneva 
recently between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton. 
  He said that he and the delegation accompanying him are 
carrying files related to all that concerns Lebanon with regard 
to economic cooperation and the role Britain could play at this 
level, in addition to holding meetings with businessmen and 
representatives of British companies. 
  Prime Minister al-Hariri said that the government -- through 
the Defense and Interior Ministries -- has programs to modernize 
the weapons of the Lebanese Army and internal security forces, 
"taking account of our current conditions, which suggest that 
facilities should be offered to enable us to pay for the new 
equipment supplied to us." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] London, AL-HAYAH -- Lebanese Prime Minister 
Rafiq al-Hariri began his official visit to Britain yesterday. 
A series of meetings culminated in a meeting with British Prime 
Minister John Major. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH, al-Hariri said that British 
officials are interested in developing bilateral relations, 
especially in work spheres. They are also interested in 
bolstering the Army and internal security forces. He stressed 
their support for Resolution 425 in order to liberate southern 
Lebanon from the Israeli occupation. 
  Al-Hariri pointed out that the policy pursued by Lebanon in 
the [peace] negotiations has produced positive results so far. 
He stressed that no one can conclude an agreement on Lebanon, 
nor can anyone conclude an agreement at Lebanon's expense. He 
said that participation in multilateral negotiations before 
progress is achieved in the bilaterals would harm Lebanon more 
than its nonparticipation in the multilaterals. He stressed the 
need to adhere to Resolution 425, "because it is the legal 
foundation for the Lebanese negotiator." 
  He pointed out that his government is working to tackle the 
peace challenge, to stand fast, and to rebuild the 
infrastructure without waiting for aid, despite its importance. 
Talking about the criticism campaign against the government, he 
said that the major part of it does not take account of the 
concept of the democratic process. "It is criticizing figures 
rather than programs."

  [Text] 'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has said 
that UN Security Council Resolution 425 has faded from 
international and U.S. memory. The UK foreign secretary may, 
out of pity, pay lip service to that resolution; other 
politicians elsewhere may do the same. However, the issue, with 
its serious political aspects, is linked to the actual 
circumstances of U.S. policy. The United States is using its 
clout to ensure that the UN recommendation makes no mention of 
Resolution 425. This resolution is losing its relevance with 
the passage of time. 
  Speaking in a television interview, Fadlallah called on 
Lebanese officials to exhibit toward the resistance the same 
commitment shown by President Hafiz al-Asad. Lebanon is 
drifting aimlessly and its political life is coming unhinged, he 
stated. 
  Fadlallah said that Geneva summit has created a new 
atmosphere, but atmosphere alone is not enough. The summit may 
grease the wheels of the negotiations and cement Syrian-U.S. 
ties. The Arab region is in a state of flux, he remarked.

<F P=106> [Interview with Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli, former secretary </F>
general of Hizballah, by Muhammad Shuqayr in Beirut; date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] [Shuqayr] Do you have a position in Hizballah? 
  [Al-Tufayli] I do not have an official position in 
Hizballah. As is known, I have given up official positions for 
some time. However, I am with them through thick and thin. I 
am always their brother. I prefer not to go into details. It 
is an internal affair. 
  [Shuqayr] It is said that you secluded yourself before the 
parliamentary elections? 
  [Al-Tufayli] I avoid talking about that issue in the media. 
I had my own view, and my brothers had their own view. It was 
an exceptional case. At any rate, please allow me not to 
address this issue in press statements. [passage omitted] 
  [Shuqayr] What is your position on the post-peace stage? 
  [Al-Tufayli] In order for us to be in the picture the 
question should be seen from all angles. There are a group of 
proposals in the region about the post-peace stage, like the 
question of resisting normalization peacefully. Some quarters 
are dealing with this question and setting conditions for it. 
What is important is not for me to look at the issue, program 
it in my mind, and form a beautiful picture of it. What is 
important is reality. 
  The question of resisting normalization through peaceful 
means and nonconfrontation with the Arab regime is not 
practical. Because the Lebanese regime clashed with those 
opposed to the Gaza-Jericho agreement at a time when it was 
opposed to this agreement. It killed and wounded many of them 
without any justification. It has ignored the case, not 
bothering to investigate it, despite its promise to do so. I 
was right in my position toward the regime and the government, 
and there is no need for me to reiterate it. 
  As for the second point, resisting normalization peacefully 
means in practice economic, informational, and diplomatic 
competition, and so on. Competitiveness between the Arab and 
Western markets is nonexistent, especially if we note that the 
U.S. economy serves the Zionist economy. And the United States 
has on several occasions reiterated its promise to guarantee 
prosperity for the Zionist economy and fight any Arab boycott. 
This means that competitiveness -- even in its weakest forms -- 
is not possible, because we do not have anything with which to 
compete with the Western economy. We daily wait for the sea to 
feed our children, that is what the West sends us.... 
  Thus resisting normalization after peace -- and in such a 
manner -- is impractical. [passage omitted] 
  [Shuqayr] What do you mean by saying that resisting 
normalization will lead to clashes with the regimes? 
  [Al-Tufayli] For example, in the form of a demonstration in 
an Arab street condemning a political sin, and, as a result, the 
authorities confront it. Or in the form of an article by a 
writer, which the authorities may regard as a threat to its 
security, stability, and peace with the enemy, hence they resort 
to punishment, pursuit, and judgment, especially as we know that 
our regimes cannot accept criticism, so how can they be expected 
to allow major opposition to take place? 
  I would like here to point out that I do not mean military 
opposition, because I do not believe that there should be 
military opposition to the existing policy in Lebanon, because 
that would not serve the issue of liberating Palestine and our 
country. On the contrary, it would thwart the liberation march. 
I say that it is our duty to bear all psychological and 
physical pressures the regime may exert and to focus on the 
confrontation with the enemy, whatever the price. Even if that 
leads to formal trials, executions, and so on. 
  I am for carrying out operations against the Zionist entity 
and the symbols of this entity, even if the price is the 
execution and killing of the mujahidin by Arab regimes. That 
should not prevent them from continuing their resistance. 
  [Shuqayr] How can a peace in which Lebanon is a partner 
alongside Syria be reconciled with your call for launching 
military resistance? 
  [Al-Tufayli] We as a people are entitled not to comply with 
any treaty by which the Lebanese regime abides. We must 
continue to resist our enemy by all military means despite the 
Lebanese regime's opposition. Even if the entire world joins 
the peace process. Our duty and task is to complete the march 
of confrontation and liberation against the Zionist entity. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Shuqayr] This position may cause a clash with the allies, 
specifically Syria. 
  [Al-Tufayli] I am not talking about the present situation 
and conditions. I am talking about an assignment for all Arabs 
and Muslims inside and outside Lebanon. I am saying that these 
should be assigned to continue the liberation march. We in 
Lebanon are part of this march. I do not claim that we can 
liberate Palestine, let alone southern Lebanon, on our own. I 
say that continuing the march in Lebanon and elsewhere 
represents a start for a big tendency in the long term, in order 
to reunite ranks in the framework of a major liberation 
operation. That requires a great deal of work and changes. 
This is what I meant. [passage omitted] 
  [Shuqayr] So you are for a new form of armed struggle? 
  [Al-Tufayli] Of course, I am for armed struggle anywhere. 
  [Shuqayr] But conditions are not favorable? 
  [Al-Tufayli] I believe they are, and they will be more 
favorable after peace is established. Egypt remains the biggest 
proof of this. In my view, the anger and bombings the Arab 
world is experiencing are the natural result of the stage of 
peace and normalization with the Zionist entity. The more the 
regimes move toward peace, the more the peoples move away from 
them and toward liberation. 
  [Shuqayr] So you are for returning to the situation that 
existed in Beirut in the past. 
  [Al-Tufayli] I do not mix up questions, and we must 
distinguish between what is Western and what is Zionist, which 
remains a target for us as fighters, militarily, diplomatically, 
economically, or informationally. 
  [Shuqayr] Even if it is decided to establish diplomatic 
relations? 
  [Al-Tufayli] Of course we will resist that diplomatic 
presence. But we should not touch the other diplomatic missions 
or communities. Nor should any establishments -- except those 
belonging to the Zionist entity -- be hit. [passage omitted] 
  [Shuqayr] But you will in the end clash with Syria, on the 
grounds that it will support legitimacy to prevent operations 
after liberation? 
  [Al-Tufayli] When I see a Zionist target, I will hit it. 
And if the price for that is my martyrdom, so be it. I will 
not cause any problem with anyone. I have caused a problem for 
myself. I have never fought against the Lebanese Army or the 
Syrian Army. I fought against the Jews and patiently withstood 
the results. 
  [Shuqayr] Is that a personal opinion, or does it represent 
Hizballah's position? 
  [Al-Tufayli] True, these are personal views. 
  [Shuqayr] Did you not raise this opinion in Hizballah? 
  [Al-Tufayli] That issue should not be discussed through the 
media. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by territories correspondent Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Text] Speaking at a news conference at al-Watani Hotel in 
East Jerusalem, Faysal al-Husayni, who recently returned from a 
visit to Saudi Arabia said: "The main goal of the Palestinian 
delegation in negotiations with Israel is to establish an 
interim rule that will incorporate the foundations for the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the 
future," noting that "no amount of pressure or repressive 
policies, such as land expropriation and the systematic 
violation of the spirit of the agreement will help Israel 
prevent this, and Israel must take this fat into account if it 
seeks to achieve real peace. If the peace process fails," 
al-Husayni asserted, "this will not be good for the future of 
democracy in Israel or for the country's very existence." 
Al-Husayni explained that "Israel may be able to enforce its 
presence to a certain degree in the future by using force; 
however, it should bear in mind that whoever lives by the sword 
is also destined to die by the sword." At the news conference, 
Israel was accused of systematically expropriating land in the 
territories and expanding settlements, even after the signing of 
the Declaration of Principles with the Palestinians on 13 
September. 
  The news conference was organized by four bodies, including 
the Palestine Geographic Research and Information Center, which 
belongs to the East Jerusalem association of Arab studies headed 
by al-Husayni; the Palestine Human Rights Information Center; 
The Saint Ives Society for Human Rights (a Catholic 
organization); and the committee for land research. 
  The representatives of these bodies accused Israel of 
expropriating 46,000 dunams along the Green Line and around 
Jerusalem for military and public use after the document of 
principles had already been signed, of expanding the settlements 
of Daniyel and Bet El by another 1,025 dunams. They also 
claimed that Israel had set up eight nature reserves on the West 
Bank, paved eight roads leading to settlements; initiated two 
development projects, encompassing 5,520 dunams, in settlements 
in the Hebron area; and forcibly evicted 46 extended families 
from the expropriated lands as well as destroying 63 houses. 
  The Palestinians claimed that Israel was employing three 
main 
methods to implement its settlement policies, which indicated 
that it had no intention of withdrawing from the territories. 
One of these methods focuses on development activity and on 
formulating new master plans to expand existing settlements (for 
example plans that were prepared for the settlements of 'Anatot, 
Tapuah, Qedumim, and Qiryat Arba'). 
  Another method is defining certain areas as "nature 
reserves," "green areas," and "open areas," in order to prevent 
the Palestinians from using the land for agriculture and 
construction purposes. The areas that were so defined, the 
Palestinian representatives claimed, are later used to build 
settlements. The Palestinians gave Rekhes Shu'fat as an 
example. This settlement was first defined as a "nature 
reserve" and later used to construct homes for ultra-Orthodox 
Jews. 
  The Palestinians complained that since the signing of the 
Oslo agreement, numerous wide-ranging plans for an Israeli 
"Greater Jerusalem" have been formulated in a similar fashion, 
while the Palestinians are being prohibited to build in these 
areas. They pointed out that since September 1993, eight areas 
near Ramallah, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Hebron, and Nabulus have 
been declared natural reserves. 
  The third method used by Israel is based on laying the 
infrastructure for the future expansion of settlements and their 
linkage with Israel.

  [Text] Damascus, 25 Jan (MENA)--A Palestinian official has 
praised Egypt's experiment in building new cities, adding that a 
Palestinian technical team will visit Cairo shortly to discuss 
this experiment with a view to applying it in Gaza and the West 
Bank. He noted that the Palestinian National Authority intends 
to build 13 new cities in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jericho areas. 
  Dr. Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, PLO Executive Committee member and 
head of the PLO Economic Department, has noted that the 
Palestinian economy is in bad shape as a result of the 
destruction sustained by the infrastructure at the hands of the 
Israeli occupation authorities. 
  Speaking to a MENA correspondent, Dr. al-Nashashibi pointed 
out that the first stage of rebuilding the infrastructure 
requires more than $365 million. He added: We need 80,000 
housing units urgently to provide housing for low-income people, 
who suffer from a major housing problem. 
  On the economic development projects in Palestine, Dr. 
al-Nashashibi pointed out that a Palestinian bank for industrial 
development will be set up with a capital of $100 million. He 
added: We have prepared an investment law and a law for 
companies, and we welcome private and joint enterprises by Arab 
investors. He noted that the port of Gaza will be modernized 
and a floating dock will be urgently built, adding that the 
Netherlands has agreed to share 40 percent of the costs of this 
project, which amounts to $50 millions. He noted that contacts 
are under way with Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, France, 
Britain, and Greece to finance infrastructure projects separate 
from those financed by the World Bank. 
  Dr. al-Nashashibi stressed that the Palestinians are in 
urgent need of 130 megawatts of electricity in Gaza and 220 
megawatts on the West Bank, noting that there are contacts with 
Egypt in this regard. 
  On Palestinian-U.S. relations, the Palestinian official 
noted 
that the Americans have promised to consider financing some 
projects other than those financed by the World Bank and the 
donor countries. They also promised to abrogate all laws enacted 
by Congress banning dealings with the Palestinians, to give 
Palestinian officials a chance to meet with U.S. businessmen, 
and to open U.S. markets to Palestinian products, he added. 
  Concluding his remarks, Dr. al-Nashashibi added: We need to 
create 50,000 jobs urgently. He noted that there are 100,000 
unemployed, representing 75 percent of the work force. He 
added: We will conclude an economic agreement with Egypt soon to 
encourage Egyptian construction companies to carry out projects 
in the West Bank and Gaza. 
  Dr. al-Nashashibi left Damascus at noon today after taking 
part in the meetings of the Arab Agricultural Development 
Organization, which concluded its work here last night.

transfer the headquarters of popular federations from Tunis to 
Gaza and Jericho upon taking over power from the Israelis. 
  It is worth noting that Tunis became the headquarters of 
eight Palestinian federations following the PLO's departure from 
Beirut in 1983. They are the federations of writers; lawyers 
and jurists; teachers, women, workers, engineers; doctors, 
pharmacists, and dentists, and farmers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Gaza -- Fatah yesterday stressed its principled 
opposition to the interrogations and killings being carried out 
in the Gaza Strip. The organization states this should only be 
done through a general and national agreement based on a 
centralized leadership decision to preserve the Palestinian 
cause. 
  In a statement distributed in Gaza, Fatah reiterated its 
demand from all organizational cadres to halt such acts because 
they harm the people's interests. It called on the Palestinian 
people, including all their popular organizations, to be alert 
and aware, with extreme patriotism, of all the conditions around 
them.

  [Excerpt] Jerusalem -- Three Palestinian factions allied 
within the PLO's framework and supportive of the peace process 
and the recent Palestinian-Israeli agreement have declared their 
intention to formulate a joint action program that enhances 
their joint role in defense of the PLO, supports their political 
positions, and develops popular rallying around those positions. 
  In a statement issued yesterday by their representatives, 
Fatah, the Palestinian People's Party, and Fida [Palestinian 
Democratic Union] announced that an expanded and urgent 
leadership meeting will be held to discuss and approve the joint 
action paper and create a suitable mechanism for implementing it 
to encompass all regions and principal organizations belonging 
to the three factions. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has 
stated that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's meeting with 
King Fahd was not genuine, but artificial. It added that the 
Tunis [PLO] leadership thinks the world supports it at a time 
when the Palestinian Oslo group began to split up. Hamas said 
the U.S. Administration is trying to activate the Syrian track 
to make up for the stalled Palestinian track. 
  Official Hamas Spokesman Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah urged Dr. 
Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi to join the Palestinian opposition because 
it is the origin. He accused Faysal al-Husayni of representing 
a phenomenon opposed to that of his father. He urged him to 
stop following this path and return to the road followed by 
'Abd-al-Qadir al-Husayni, the martyr of Palestine. 
  Ghawshah told SAWT AL-SHA'B that no force can prevent Hamas 
from performing its duty and struggling against the Israeli 
occupation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] London, QUDS PRESS -- A Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] spokesman has denied Hamas' connection in any way with 
attacks launched by fundamentalists against government targets 
in Egypt. 
  A responsible Hamas source said that talk about Hamas' link 
with a captured fugitive in an ambush set up by the Egyptian 
police in Cairo's suburbs last week is totally fabricated and 
baseless. This sort of talk is devoid of logic and credibility 
and falls within framework of the deliberate campaign of 
distortion against Hamas' positions in the Arab world. 
  The source reiterated that Hamas' armed activity is limited 
to resisting Israel. He pointed out that Hamas does not carry 
out this sort of activity against any Arab or foreign party. 
Such activity is not a Hamas strategy.

<F P=106> [Interview with Taysir 'Aruri, member of the Political </F>
Bureau of the Palestinian People's Party by 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Khatib; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Al-Khatib] In your opinion, why have the Taba 
talks faltered, and what solution do you propose? 
  ['Aruri] I think that the impasse in the Taba negotiations 
is 
caused by the very nature of the agreement reached in Oslo 
between the Palestinian and Israeli sides. This agreement 
allows for many interpretations. In addition, the Declaration 
of Principles was drafted hastily, since the negotiators in Oslo 
were in a hurry to announce it. Moreover, the impasse is a 
result of the way the negotiations are being conducted and the 
fact that the Israeli side is seeking more and more concessions. 
We should not be surprised if the negotiations in Taba and 
elsewhere face similar problems and if the Palestinian side 
offers more concessions. I hope that this will not happen. 
  What worries me most about the ongoing negotiations is the 
question of the Israeli settlements in the Oslo agreement. I am 
not playing down the question of the crossings and others, since 
this question has to do with sovereignty. However, transforming 
the Gaza settlements from an isolated, separate area into a 
connected area, regardless of the name, will certainly entrench 
the existence of these settlements on the ground. Let alone the 
territories that will be added to these settlements to form a 
so-called security belt. This is the most serious question in 
the Taba talks. I regret to say that this question is not being 
given enough attention. 
  [Al-Khatib] So you are not optimistic at all? 
  ['Aruri] The way the negotiations are being conducted by the 
Palestinian side bodes an uncomfortable future which raises many 
fears regarding the progress of negotiations and the future 
solution. 
  [Al-Khatib] The Palestinian People's Party has a certain 
view of President Yasir 'Arafat's unchallenged control of the 
negotiations. This prompted your party to withdraw from the 
negotiations committee. What are you going to do if President 
'Arafat continues to pursue this approach? Do you have any 
plans to talk to the 10 factions? 
  ['Aruri] You should not forget that our position originally 
stems from our party's support for the peace process and the 
negotiations as a means of resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
We also subscribe to the Madrid terms. We still think that the 
peace process could lead to a Palestinian state and to national 
independence if the Palestinian side acts wisely. Therefore, 
our dispute with President 'Arafat and the parties to the 
negotiations has to do with the approach and how the 
negotiations are being conducted. If the negotiations are not 
carefully conducted, then this will have dire consequences for 
the Palestinian people. We support those who are against the 
Declaration of Principles, since this idea is open to all 
possibilities, starting with bolstering occupation and ending 
with independence and the establishment of a state. It is our 
job, therefore, to change the way the political process is being 
conducted and to change the decisionmaking process. Toward this 
end, we are prepared to talk to our allies in Fatah and to talk 
to all other Palestinian forces. We do not believe in boycott 
as a form of political action. We are prepared to talk to 
everybody, including the 10 factions. However, we will talk to 
them as one faction and not as a group. Our party does not plan 
at all to join the group of 10. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Beware of Lack of Coordination with Damascus </F>
and Amman] 
  [Text] All elements of the Arab negotiating side have 
their significance, role, and centrality in the peace process. 
The key to peace is not only in the hands of the Palestinian 
element. This fact should not be absent from the minds of the 
Palestinian leadership, which signed an agreement with Israel 
before the others. This signing does not mean that we should 
ignore the importance of coordination with the Arab side's other 
elements, foremost of all Amman and Damascus. 
  Enhanced coordination with Jordan and Syria must continue 
and 
proceed on the highest levels. Any rift with this or that side 
should be avoided and no issue or stance should outweigh the 
importance of coordination with the Jordanian and Syrian sides. 
  True, the Palestinian side's decisionmaking is independent, 
but this does not mean that the Palestinian leadership should 
"turn its back" on fraternal Syria and Jordan. A rift with them 
or sufficing with a fragile and pretentious coordination harms 
the Palestinian cause and position and gives Israel an 
additional opportunity to pursue positions rejected by the 
Palestinian side. Moreover, rifts and lack of coordination 
constitute an element of pressure in Israel's hands against the 
Palestinian side. Beware of hostility with Damascus and beware 
of lack of strong and serious coordination with Amman.

Article Type:BFN 

<F P=106> ["Political commentary" by Yahya Rabah, Palestinian </F>
representative in Sanaa: "Illusions of Exile and Realities of 
the Homeland"] 
  [Text] By now, the Palestinian opposition factions must 
have realized, beyond any doubt or ambiguity, that the 
PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles agreement is an 
established fact, and that the ceiling of the required and 
legitimate struggle is how to embody the Palestinian reading of 
this agreement to try to rid it of its drawbacks and build on 
its positive aspects in the interest of the Palestinian people. 
  Speaking about foiling the agreement is no more than talk 
meant to justify avoiding the battle waged by the Palestinian 
people now to establish their national entity, lay the 
foundations of an independent Palestinian state, and open all 
practical, objective doors toward achieving all Palestinian 
rights. 
  We hope that our brothers in the Palestinian opposition 
factions would end their escape, based on the following facts: 
  First, the room for maneuver of these factions is getting 
smaller, despite their recent statement in which they said that 
the Palestine question is an Islamic and pan-Arab affair. All 
Arab and Islamic countries, in line with their interests and 
strategies, deal with this question, at best, through a national 
and regional perspective. Perhaps, we are now at the threshold 
of a stage in which these factions will not find a place for 
their own security except in a Palestinian safe haven. 
  Second, it is the policy of these factions to adhere to form 
rather than substance, and this cannot last long. We have 
noticed that, during the recent meetings of these factions, they 
avoided discussing any issues of substance. They only agreed on 
formalities that do not give an accurate reflection of reality, 
such as the illusion that collective leadership and democratic 
action lie only in equal representation and periodic leadership. 
To stress that this question has to do with formalities and is 
not in line with reality, we say that the alliance between the 
Democratic Front [for the Liberation of Palestine] and the 
Popular Front [for the Liberation of Palestine] on the one hand 
and Hamas on the other, which was implemented during the Bi'r 
Zayt University elections, was not observed in the elections of 
the Islamic University in Gaza. This is a natural thing. The 
Hamas Movement, for example, would not play the game of an 
alliance in form only all the time. This is in light of its 
size. This means that hard realities shall always conquer weak 
alliances. 
  Third, Palestinian public opinion wants the Palestinian 
factions to gear their national resistance capabilities toward 
development by adopting a practical approach for action, and not 
by escape. This is especially true since the banner of 
Palestinian national dialogue is held high by the legitimate 
leadership of the Palestinian people, the PLO leadership, and by 
a major, broad current of our people, particularly in the main 
arena of the homeland itself. 
  Based on the above, we wish the Palestinian opposition 
factions would end their state of national loss, which they 
brought on themselves as a result of adhering to the language 
and conduct of the past and as a result of their dependence on 
realities which they thought are fixed and would not change. 
The truth is these realities are changeable and complex. 
  Whatever they do, the opposition factions are part of our 
national struggle and entity, and we care for this part. We do 
not want to see those factions blown away by the winds outside 
time and space. We do not want the Palestinian opposition to 
establish their existence on an illusory island which is, in 
reality, the back of a sleeping crocodile that will awake and 
drown the illusory island. Yes, the banner of dialogue and 
participation is held high. For the first time in history, we, 
Palestinians, are going to a homeland of our own that carries 
our name to start our life. Perhaps reality does not match 
one's expectations. However, participation in building the 
homeland, no matter how modest, is a thousand times better than 
illusory heroism in alliances in exile, which will not last 
long.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ali Kafi, chairman of the Higher State Council, </F>
at the opening of the national conference on consensus at the 
Club des Pins in Algiers -- live] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. Prayers and peace be upon the noblest of 
messengers. 
  Ladies and gentlemen: We are meeting here today at the 
national consensus conference to continue the dialogue which we 
started in September 1992. We are hoping that dialogue at this 
conference will reach its desired goal; that is, the removal of 
the country from the current crisis in order that normal life, 
tranquillity, and peace may return to Algeria, which will then 
be able to continue its development process in an atmosphere of 
security. My Lord, make this land secure [Koranic verse]. 
  I am sure that this is the expectation and the yearning of 
all Algerians who are placing their hopes in our conference. 
Hence, it is our duty to rise to our responsibility and deliver 
what is required. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the Higher State Council [HCE] has 
shouldered its responsibilities during a very difficult stage. 
[Words indistinct] it has to face up to a complicated and 
critical situation which resulted from the poor management of 
the transition to democracy brought about by the Constitution of 
February 1989. This laid down a new political system for 
building the state, for the management of the country, and for 
the organization of the political society. This was in addition 
to the roots of the crisis which led to the tragic October 
events and the elements of which continued in existence. The 
absence of control over the new political system led to the 
haphazard application of the Constitution, which made the 
situation more critical. The organization of the election 
contest, whether at the local or the national level, showed the 
fragility of the administration and the state structures, 
leading us to chaos. The logic of the street overcame the logic 
of the state and opened the way to all possible pitfalls. All 
this led to the crisis of the establishments resulting from the 
resignation of the head of state by the end of the term of 
office of the People's National Council. This required the 
setting up of the HCE with the aim of guaranteeing the 
continuation of the state and completing the remaining 
legislative term. The urgent and circumstantial conditions that 
the HCE faced and the critical situation that existed then did 
not make the HCE cut short its task by merely covering the 
constitutional vacuum. It had to address the real problems of 
the country, clarify views with the political, economic, and 
social partners as well as the national cadres, search for ways 
of liquidating the crisis at its roots, and prepare the 
conditions for the creation of a qualitative transformation in 
the country's march. 
  We found ourselves facing a political crisis which had 
resulted from a lack of control over the transition process, the 
strong and active presence of elements and practices of the 
previous regime, as well as the ossified mentalities which fear 
and reject change. We were also facing an economic crisis, the 
main features of which were heavy debts, stagnant economic 
growth, and inefficient enterprises in addition to smuggling and 
speculation which are bidding to dominate the markets. We were 
also facing an acute social crisis represented in the great 
delay in any response to the needs of the population, 
particularly in the spheres of employment and housing; this has 
been a cause of concern to young people and has led to a loss of 
confidence in the future. 
  While we were facing this multifaceted crisis, the tragic 
assassination of the martyr Mohamed Boudiaf, may God bless his 
soul, took place. He was one of the prominent leaders of the 1 
November revolution who gave his life for the sake of our dear 
homeland's advancement. [passage omitted] 
  With that tragedy there was an escalation of savage 
terrorism, destructive to the country's material, human, and 
moral resources and aimed at blocking the path to any real 
effort to find effective solutions to the complex problems we 
are facing. Terrorism has created a security situation that is 
threatening the nation's unity and destiny. 
  This tragic situation did not discourage the HCE from going 
ahead with dealing with the crisis at its roots. The HCE 
initiated a wide and comprehensive dialogue with political 
parties, popular organizations, associations, and national 
figures. The option was neither circumstantial nor tactical; it 
was a strategic option and a cautious attitude toward political 
practice, running the government, and organizing social 
relations. 
  We were aware from the outset that dialogue was the more 
difficult path to take, but it was the right path to deal with 
the roots of the crisis and prevent its repetition. Serious and 
difficult dialogue requires patience and stamina, enabling us to 
instill the concepts and culture of dialogue and overcome 
violent methods in every field of social and political activity. 
  Dialogue was very difficult in an atmosphere of violence and 
terror, which was destructive, and in a difficult security 
situation. It required us to leave the concept of a single 
party and monopoly behind and enter the era of pluralism which 
dictates, by its very nature, the acceptance of conflicting and 
contradicting ideas and proposals. 
  Despite the will and the determination of the HCE to make 
the 
national dialogue successful and allow it to attain its sought 
after aims, however, some parties, with much regret, have taken 
a negative attitude toward the dialogue; they have even 
boycotted the conference. By such a stance, they are trying to 
make the nation miss a golden opportunity. They have put their 
narrow partisan calculations, even personal ones, before the 
interests of the nation. Such a stance runs counter to the 
concept of democracy we have been trying to implement. 
  In these decisive circumstances in the history of the 
nation, 
we place the responsibility before national public opinion, 
which is aspiring to security and stability. Despite all of 
this we continued the dialogue with insistence and methodology. 
And here we are meeting today, thanks to that conduct, in a 
national conference for reconciliation. This in itself is a 
great acheivement we should cherish and take care of. 
  In the midst of the economic crisis and its pressing 
elements, while the critical economic situation was imposing 
itself forcefully and urgently, and after extensive studies and 
wide consultations, the HCE had furnished the tools that enable 
our economy to rise again on modern bases and criteria. It 
passed the new investment law which is characterised by 
flexibility, encouragement, and adequate guarantees for national 
and foreign investment. 
  In response to economic and social partners, the HCE issued 
a 
law on the setting up of a national economic and social council 
as an extensive and appropriate framework for consultations on 
and dealing with various issues posed by national development 
during a phase of transition to a new economic system, taking 
into consideration the principle of social justice and the state 
of the underprivileged groups in society. It made the 
appropriate decisions regarding the management of debts with 
international financial institutions and the provision of fresh 
possibilities to stimulate the national economy. [passage 
omitted] 
  In the international domain, and proceeding from this 
promising starting point, we have taken part in all important 
regional and international meetings. We have resisted the 
attempts to isolate our country which were made by some parties 
who exploited the temporary crisis through which the country is 
passing. 
  The pressure of events and the impetuous reactions and 
passions which they generate have not diverted the HCE from 
exerting the efforts necessary to overcome the present 
difficulties and from searching for a new proposal for running 
the country on scientific, technological, rational, and modern 
foundations. 
  The transition to this new proposal makes it necessary for 
sincere patriots to face up to the basic challenges and all the 
exertions, patience, courage, creative thought, and working 
methods that they demand. We have been able to face up to the 
situation by mobilizing the dynamic forces of the country and 
sincere citizens. 
  On this occasion, we pay our respects to the martyrs of 
violence and terrorism and we praise the Armed Forces, the 
security services, the cadres, the workers, and the citizens who 
are determined that the state will continue and that 
institutions and the country's affairs will go on as normal. 
  Ladies and gentlemen: Regardless of what is being said about 
the present situation and notwithstanding the difficulties 
facing us, the current problems are more than just problems of 
the power struggle; they are in reality problems of a society in 
transformation, a society that greatly aspires to qualitative 
changes and to a comprehensive development -- a society which 
ought to reconsider itself in order to find the best means for 
organizing its life and bring about progress and prosperity to 
its members. 
  This shows that the crisis is not an easy one; it also shows 
the enormity of the efforts which have to be exerted in order to 
resolve it. However, such a solution will not be found through 
a decree, through some improvised measures, or during a short 
period, nor will it be within the power of a single group or 
bloc; it should be carried out by the nation as a whole. It 
will not be attained through a comprehensive and long-term 
strategy. 
  It is, however, obvious that such a solution will, 
inevitably, only take place once institutional problems have 
been resolved through the holding of multiparty presidential and 
legislative elections within the framework of the new political 
framework which we have been trying to establish upon the 
principles of republicanism. These principles which have 
unanimously been agreed upon, and stipulate pluralism, freedom 
of the press, individual and collective freedoms, human rights, 
and the alternatn of the principle of power by holding general 
elections. 
  The organizing of the election contest on these bases and 
principles is the method which leads to the solving of the 
institutional problem, and this is the target of the 
transitional phase which has become acceptable by way of 
dialogue as means for reaching a national consensus. In order 
to succeed in this experiment and build the new political system 
it is inevitable that we should confront the following 
challenges: 
  1. Our capability to overcome the security challenge, as 
without the liquidation of violence, the restoration of 
security, and the country's stability, it is impossible to 
realize democracy no matter what efforts we make, irrespective 
of our intentions. 
  2. As for the building of a modern strong state, how can we 
build the state and give it its status and at the same time 
consolidate democracy? The state is a system and a collection 
of behavior patterns and values. Also democracy, the building 
of a democratic system cannot be done in a fragile state, nor 
the building of a strong developed state without a democratic 
system. 
  3. How can we build democracy and realize the development 
project? There can be no development without democracy which 
permits the full usage of the nation's energies and 
capabilities. There can be no democracy in deteriorating 
economic and social situations. 
  4. Our initiative in building a democratic system and a 
developed generation deeply rooted in the nation, and 
infiltrating the values and identity of our people, is a system 
which will not be isolated from positive international 
experiments. This means that we create the change which is 
imposed by the transformation currently taking place at the 
national and international levels, boycott the past methods and 
practices, and at the same time maintain our foundations, 
experience, and historic origin. 
  5. Define, establish and consolidate Algeria's position in 
the new world order which is about to take shape amid the 
ongoing stormy changes and ways of enabling it to assume its 
normal role as an active and effective state at the 
international level. This requires response to all the 
challenges. It would be possible to build our own special and 
creative experience through these challenges in the framework of 
the development of modern human experiences. Success will not 
be a gain only for Algerians; the same as the great 1 November 
revolution, it will be a gain for all the peoples aspiring to 
freedom. It is neither our right nor anyone else's right to be 
the reason for depriving the Algerian people of achieving this 
pioneering experience. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the building of the political system 
which we are endeavoring to construct and the overcoming of the 
challenges we are facing constitute a basis for the evolving 
national project [mashru'] to the building of which all 
Algerians are contributing. The national project draws its 
strength and its principles from the spirit of the evolving 1 
November revolution. 
  It is certain that our success in moving to the new 
political 
system and in establishing a successful democracy in security, 
prosperity, and stability is a fresh rebirth or a rebirth and a 
renewal of the 1 November eternal revolution. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, all the difficulties not withstanding, 
the Algerians are against adventurism and violence. They are 
capable of conducting dialogue and living in security in the 
shadow of national unity. They are committed to their faith and 
tradition, and are open to the outside world. They are heading 
with confidence towards the future. 
  Today at this conference we all have to rise to the level of 
our historic responsibility and leave behind personal and 
temporary accounts regardless of their justifications. We have 
to work with a unified and profound will to get the country out 
of the current situation and take it to the land of safety. All 
of us bear full responsibility in that respect. 
  The conference is not the end of dialogue. The dialogue will 
continue in all forms and with the spirit of honesty, 
credibility, and responsibility. We have to firmly establish 
the principles of dialogue, consultation, and solidarity and to 
eliminate once and for all all manifestations of violence which 
are alien to our society, religion, and homeland and sow the 
seeds of hope. We have no right to deny the Algerians males and 
females this hope. 
  May God guide us toward the good of our nation and the unity 
and safety of our homeland and may peace and God's compassion 
and blessings be upon you.

<F P=106> [Address by Interior Minister Selim Saadi at the opening of </F>
the national conference on consensus at the Club des Pins in 
Algiers -- live] 
  [Text] In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate, 
prayers and peace be upon the noblest messenger. 
  President of the Higher State Council [HCE], Chairman of the 
national conference, sisters and brothers. The multifold crisis 
that our country is currently experiencing is the result of the 
bankruptcy of the management, the political management of the 
country during the last decade. The violation of the basic 
rules of political management, whether consciously or 
unconsciously, for a long time has led to the deterioration of 
the state and its apparatus. For over a decade, improvisation, 
demagoguery, and manipulation have become part of the system of 
government. Moreover, the economic, social, and cultural reform 
process, which the country went through during the sixties and 
seventies, despite some setbacks, and which was an important 
gain for our people, has gradually become a subject of 
retraction through illogical and irresponsible acts and behavior. 
  The weakening, unsettlement, and deterioration of government 
have led to its retreat and return to political, economic, 
social, and cultural backwardness, as well as to the widespread 
absence of security. The security situation that was prevalent 
on the eve of the declaration of the state of emergency in most 
of the provinces, particularly in the great residential 
complexes, was a source of concern for various reasons. The 
public security was threatened alongside the deterioration of 
the public authorities' capabilities and the prevalence of chaos 
and confusion in all sectors. Faced by this rapid deterioration 
of the political, social, and security atmosphere, the national 
forces -- aware of the fatal danger that was lurking over 
Algeria -- decided to halt this destructive process and declared 
a state of emergency. Despite the noticeable progress as a 
result of declaring a state of emergency to restore law and 
order, the forces of evil have not stopped. They have committed 
terrorist, barbaric, and destructive crimes, some of which I 
recall: the assassination of the government's representatives, 
war veterans and martyrs' sons; the assassination of ordinary 
citizens, men, women, mothers, children, young and elderly; the 
assassination of foreign nationals who came to our country to 
contribute to the economy of the country; the plundering and 
sabotage acts against financial institutes, post offices, and 
public and private enterprises; the daily robbing and stripping 
citizens of their money; sabotaging collective complexes; and 
setting fire and destroying administrative and economic public 
enterprises. 
  These savage actions are being carried out by people who 
claim to be religious and use religion as a political means. 
They are being carried out by a small band of perverts and 
persons who have judicial records, who harbor hatred -- the 
enemies of the homeland -- whose hearts are still pained to see 
Algeria independent, and who act as if they are on enemy soil. 
They are receiving support from certain countries which are 
living under oppressive and backward regimes and do not conceal 
their intention to spread this type of regime to Algeria. 
  To foil this subversive process, the public authorities 
carried out a series of actions to protect individuals and 
property and to put an end to this disease at its roots. The 
security forces, the state cadres, and the local communities -- 
and here we should not forget to stress their great sacrifices 
and their devotion, as well as their altruism in serving the 
country's sublime interests -- have implemented practical 
security measures to protect individuals and their property. 
These are particularly manifested in the following: 
undertaking the protection of installations of public economic 
establishments and public administrative departments; the 
protection of foreign missions, foreign establishments, and 
foreign employees who are present on the national soil; the 
protection of individuals, establishments, and public and 
private bodies; the consolidation of the local public security; 
and searching and putting an end to the perpetrators of criminal 
acts. 
  The fact that some political forces have not condemned the 
subversion of the economic, social, and cultural institutions 
that independent Algeria has achieved at an exorbitant price and 
through great sacrifices, is regarded as an act of treachery, 
which the next generation will not forgive. 
  History will judge all those who kept silent: Their silence 
is shameful. They kept silent while repugnant crimes were being 
committed against national assets and innocent citizens, namely 
state employees, the mojahedin, and the foreigners who came here 
to participate in the development of Algeria. Irrespective of 
the political differences between us, the people's gains assume 
the quality of sacredness and should not be at the center of 
political dealings and point scoring. 
  In the light of these events it appears necessary and 
inevitable that the state should retrieve its self-respect and 
authority. As a matter of fact we cannot build democracy 
without a strong state based on stable structures which 
guarantee the continuity of the state and protect it from 
politically irresponsible by-ways and deviations. 
  Proceeding from this [passage indistinct] which adopts 
scientific and rational methods which works in the interest of 
the citizens, and undertake their tasks in the best way 
possible. This is a condition for the continuity of the 
Algerian state. The planned reform aims at the following: a 
better balance between objectives; centralization or 
decentralization; greater protection for officials from 
oppression; consolidation of oversight by the state to avoid 
discrepancies in local management with regard to the laws and 
procedures which are in force by reviving the supervision bodies 
at all levels; in consultation with local representatives 
reviewing where necessary the administrative division of the 
municipalities and districts in an effort to give more 
effectiveness and a better response to citizens' needs; 
consolidation of organization and improvement of the financial 
management of local communities to achieve a better management 
of financial resources. 
  The weakening of [words indistinct] of the state, capable of 
undertaking the major public tasks, and the absence of objective 
legalized standards and of a just and rational standard 
concerning the assumption of very senior posts have led to the 
emergence of nepotism, of favoritism based on region, and 
especially of building up an entourage, which led to loyalty to 
the state being replaced by loyalty to men. This led to evident 
instability in the very senior posts, thus obstructing the 
continuity of the state and its institutions. 
  The current reform, which basically depends on restoring 
self-respect to the administration, aims at creating a total and 
immediate ban on nepotism, whether based on personal 
relationship or regionalism, and of the use of entourage. 
  In conclusion, it should be said that the modern state which 
we want to build requires efficiency, ethics, and tireless work 
as we have to raise the challenge anew so that we will not 
remain isolated from the march of civilized progress. Our 
country still possesses human and material capabilities which 
allow it to build a modern and strong state -- a law-governed 
state -- which will move the wheel of political development 
forward and facilitate entry into a real democracy and an 
economic, social, and cultural development within the framework 
of a free and organized economy. 
  It is time for all national forces in the country to unite 
our efforts to contribute to the work started by the public 
authorities to put an end to terrorism and establish law and 
order, and to contribute also in building a strong state 
guaranteeing success in the march toward political democracy and 
economic revival which will promote the prosperity of Algeria 
and make it a country where life is enjoyable -- an Algeria 
whose voice will be heard and respected by other nations. 
  Through our unity and by placing Algeria above every 
consideration, we will overcome all obstacles and triumph -- God 
willing -- over anyone who diverts us from our path. May God 
bring us success for the good of our country. Peace and God's 
mercy and blessing be upon you. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report on the economy by Economy Minister Mourad Benachnou </F>
at the conference on national consensus at the Club des Pins in 
Algiers -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Mr. Chairman of the Higher State Council; Mr. 
Chairman of the National Dialogue Commission; Mr. Head of the 
Government; ladies and gentlemen: The government has carried 
out, since its formation, an analysis of the financial and 
economic situation in the country in order to detect the 
underline factors which would help in slowing, if not stopping, 
the deterioration. As such, the situation is characterized by 
the following features: 
  A spiral inflation which has grown by about 2 percent per 
month for the widely consumed goods; 
  A quasi-end to job creation and the loss of job 
opportunities 
in all sectors of production as a result of lack of investment 
and the bad management of the economy. Thus, unemployment, 
which is rife among youth, was on the increase; 
  A financial situation was characterized by a deficit in the 
public sector of the economy, a matter which compelled the 
treasury to pay off part of this sector's debts; 
  A sharp deficit in the budget: It was much more than what 
was 
estimated at the beginning of the year. It was the result of a 
drop in the oil revenues, in particular, as a result of a drop 
in the oil prices in world markets, in addition to a decrease in 
ordinary tax revenues, given the decline in the production and 
service sectors of the economy; 
  A sharp imbalance in the balance of payment which led to 
restricting imports and controlling through the use of rules and 
laws scares foreign currency resources. This led to a grave 
scarcity of the intermediate goods which are destined to the 
productive apparatus. [passage omitted] 
  Two-pronged activity was undertaken to re-organize the 
economy: A corrective activity directed towards the achievement 
of a balance between the available resources and domestic and 
foreign expenditures. [passage omitted] 
  An economic revival activity which was aiming at creating 
productive working posts and consequently reducing unemployment 
through investment, the revival of the economic apparatus, 
regaining the confidence of the private economic operators and 
the reorganization of the distribution net work. 
  The success of this revival activity requires a progress in 
economic reforms and its implementation has to begin, 
particularly in the fields that include special initiatives and 
the sectors which have significant repercussion on the economy 
such as the building sector. Around these two axes, the most 
important activities of the government in the economic, 
financial, and monetary spheres were presented in this brief 
round-up. [passage omitted] 
  Generally speaking, the in-depth analysis of the 
government's 
activities and its intervention should show that the scope of 
its activities have focussed on reforming and stimulating the 
economy. Concerning economic reforms, under this title comes 
the current relations with the IMF aimed at achieving a plan of 
economic stability, dealing with foreign debts and introducing 
measures to reduce the budget deficit. 
  Regarding relations with the IMF, the government decided 
since its appointment to resume negotiations with the IMF in 
order to draw a plan for stability. This decision was based on 
the following estimated factors: The main features of the state 
of the internal and external finance are an increasing deficit 
in the budget as a result of the decline in the petroleum 
revenue and increasing difficulties in securing financial cover 
for imports through external financing at reasonable cost. 
  The restoration of internal and external financial 
equilibriums, I mean a return to an economic policy financed by 
the existing resources, is the only way to control inflation, 
boost the economic apparatus, promote private investment, reduce 
speculative economic activities, and launch actions for the 
creation of productive and permanent jobs for young people. 
  Thus, the government is determined to face up to the 
country's economic and financial situation. There was no 
suitable remedy [as heard] to improve growth and create jobs. 
These facts have led to the resumption of talks with the 
International Monetary Fund. It is worth mentioning in this 
respect that these talks were never interrupted. The government 
has given these talks a clear objective and it has drawn up a 
strategy of negotiations with the IMF taking into account the 
particular circumstances which the country is going through. 
  This objective was announced from the very start and the 
idea 
is to achieve a program for economic stability. As a result of 
this strategy these negotiations have moved in a direction which 
allows our country to benefit from the support and understanding 
of our international partners with a view to persuading the IMF 
to take into account our country's special situation and also to 
pool its own financial resources to help us in our efforts to 
revive the economy. It is worth noting that the government was 
anxious not to start negotiations with the IMF before informing 
its social partners, workers and trade unions. The government 
thus presented the analysis which led it to choose this path and 
also the strategies of the negotiations [as heard] which will 
follow. 
  The talks with the IMF consisted of three stages. In the 
first stage, there was a joint analysis of the country's 
economic and financial situation. This analysis led to in-depth 
discussions last September in Washington between government 
representatives and senior officials in the IMF. In the second 
stage, the two sides agreed to define the economic, financial, 
and monetary measures which the government would adopt to 
stabilize the economy. The talks relating to this stage were 
held in Algeria in the first two weeks of December 1993 between 
a team of Algerian experts and a team of IMF experts. The 
objective sought by the two sides was mainly to reach an 
understanding on elements of the economic policy which should 
include a structured program in order to improve the country's 
economic and financial situation. 
  In the third stage, the two sides agreed to lay down 
criteria 
on which these various elements should be based with a view to 
achieving the desired economic and financial results. They also 
agreed to discuss these criteria on the strength of technical 
reports prepared by the two sides. 
  The elements of the plan of stability which received 
financial support from the IMF must be tackled during this 
stage. Intensive work had been undertaken to prepare for these 
negotiations both at the level of the government and the 
technical bodies. The technical aspects of relations with the 
IMF are considered to be under control. They attracted the 
attention of the directors of the economy concerning the correct 
Algerian viewpoint with regard to the soundness of its program 
which will be put before the IMF. These directors have 
expressed their approval and support after Algeria reached 
agreement with the IMF. [passage omitted] 
  The government in its negotiations with the IMF provided for 
itself a negotiating margin to enable it to stringently and 
clearly undertake this plan which would have positive effects on 
social strata. In this framework, one can explain the measures 
that had been taken recently with the General Union of Algerian 
Workers [UGTA] within the framework of social protection. 
[passage omitted] 
  With regard to the problem of foreign debts, foreign debts 
at 
the end 1993 stood at $25.9 billion. It is expected that 
servicing these debts in 1994 would cost $9.3 billion out of 
which 7.1 billion dollars are earmarked for the loans and $2.2 
billion as interest. 
  The revenues from exports during the same year could be less 
than the cost of servicing the debts. As well as being heavy in 
terms of the economy's ability to sustain servicing them, the 
main feature of Algeria's foreign debts is that they are of very 
short terms and they must be settled within a period of three 
years. The heavy weight of the debts had increased as a result 
of the drop in the revenues from the exports of carbohydrates 
coupled with the continuing fall in the price of a barrel of oil 
and this doubles the efforts to tackle it. The search for a 
negotiated solution with the creditors to reduce foreign debts 
must take place through a deal with the IMF. However, this 
entails results which are known beforehand and effects that can 
be undertaken. As far as the budget deficit is concerned, 
the government has paid great importance to reduce the budget 
deficit which has resulted from a number of economic 
complications; it is matter which should be taken seriously. 
  The financial year 1993 was ahead of the forecast; a matter 
which has enabled the government to take measures to reduce this 
year's deficit, which is estimated at 12 percent of the GDP. 
However, as far as 1994 is concerned a number of measures, 
which would allow a reduction of the deficit to an acceptable 
level, around 3.6 percent of the GDP, have been taken. Although 
this should still be considered a high level given the 
inflationary trends in the economy this figure can, however, be 
achieved through the following measures: 
  Cuts in a number of secondary expenditure which would be 
coupled with further rationalization of other expenditures. 
  An increase in ordinary tax revenues; which will be achieved 
only through a program to combat tax evasion. [passage omitted]. 
The use of some of the money, which has been set aside for the 
past few years. [passage omitted] 
  Encouraging investments in the framework of the small and 
medium-sized companies thanks, in particular, to the law on 
investments directed mainly at the private sector. 
  Enforcing the finance law of 1994. 
  Facilitating the objection of foreign financing. 
  As far as the law on investments and encouraging small- and 
medium-sized companies are concerned, and regarding the 
financial situation of the country, it is difficult to lay down 
a strict program of economic research. The economy, however, 
has the potential to have vitality instilled into it, and this 
potential has not been fully exploited. For this, it needs 
individual initiative as this is based on restoring confidence 
in the private sector in particular. 
  Since it was appointed, the government has adopted a number 
of measures aimed at not marginalizing the private sector. 
[passage omitted] 
  Protecting national production was the subject of measures 
aimed at raising duties on some products. All import 
restrictions would be lifted on those products which might 
compete with national products. 
  Measures had also been taken to encourage products destined 
for export by reducing customs duties imposed on raw and 
semi-manufactured materials used in the manufacturing of 
products suitable for export. 
  In the same context, and in order to encourage economic 
activities by companies whose capital allows for the sharing of 
risks between numerous investors in a single project, the tax 
index on the companies' profits had been reduced from 42 percent 
to 38 percent in the present financial law. 
  Concerning facilities for acquiring hard currency, in 
addition to these measures, which are of a legislative nature 
and which reflect the government's desire to encourage the 
revival of economic activities, the sum of 60 million American 
dollars in cash was made to the banks to cover the needs of the 
private sector for imported materials and spare parts. 
  Within the same context, the special committee received 
instructions to grant permits for obtaining foreign financing 
for the import requests submitted by the private sector to 
obtain products for the sectors considered of priority, such as 
the construction sector. 
  To these measures was added the settlement of the problem of 
the loss in exchange rate incurred by some private investors as 
a result of the devaluation of the dinar in 1991. 
  All these emergency measures would pave the way for the 
solid 
revival of the productive activities of the sector of small and 
medium enterprises. 
  The adopted economic policy forms a sovereign national 
choice 
which is responsible and which was taken after a lot of thinking 
and adapted to the serious challenges of the current situation. 
This policy, the essential points of which have already been 
presented, has been completed and consolidated, particularly 
with tight and realistic plans, to correct the course of 
national or local public enterprises whose problems have been 
identified. These enterprises will have to adapt their methods 
of management to the new situation which is characterized by 
special requirements. 
  In order to allow it to bear fruit, this policy was adopted 
as a method of work in reorganizing the national financial 
resources. This policy constitutes a rational choice for a 
successful move to a market economy since numerous elements of 
such an economy have already been put in place. This policy 
requires a continuous effort, discipline and a firmness which 
does not tolerate shortcomings. In addition to the basic 
choices which meet the requirements of the present time, the 
reform and the revival of the economy depend on an collective 
effort since they will guarantee a return of growth and restore 
hopes for a regained prosperity to be shared out among everyone. 
God's peace and mercy be upon you. [applause]

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The conference's official 
spokesman stated that 1,235 people participated in the 
conference. [passage omitted] 
  The official spokesman Abdelkader Bensalah affirmed further 
that the disbanded Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] is not present 
in the conference. However, contacts, which are still 
continuing, have taken place but they have been very difficult. 
The first signs are nonetheless encouraging. The following are 
excerpts from the statement of the official spokesman of the 
conference: 
  [Begin Bensalah recording] As far as the Islamic tendency is 
concerned, I would like to say to you here that such a tendency 
is not present at the national dialogue conference, contrary to 
whatever has been said or published. On this occasion, however, 
it is necessary to inform you that contacts have taken place 
with this tendency. Such contacts are still continuing but they 
have been difficult given the particularities of this tendency. 
However, the first signs of these contacts have been 
enouraging. [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, there is intense activity in the corridors of the 
Palais des Nations. There are consultations, contacts, rumors, 
and reports on the personalities who could be appointed for the 
transition period. Nobody can at this stage confirm or deny 
these reports. Some parties have even held meetings on the 
sidelines of the conference. Tension became so acute at times 
that some participants stayed outside the conference hall. 
  In a nutshell, this conference is shrouded in suspense as 
several assumptions are being made. Some say the conference has 
failed or will fail, while others say this conference is a 
prelude to a serious dialogue. The rest say that the conference 
will remain open and that the remaining partners to the dialogue 
may join. 
  This evening, the text of the draft proposal on the platform 
for a consensus on the transition period was handed out to the 
participants and journalists. The article which was amended a 
second time and which has attracted everybody's attention is 
article six of section one on the presidency of the state. This 
article says: A head of state will be in charge of the 
presidency of the state. The head of state can appoint one or 
two deputies. The two deputies will assist the head of state in 
the tasks assigned to them by him. The head of state will be 
appointed by the Higher Security Council. This last point is 
reported to have caused huge disagreements between the 
participants and the bureau of the conference represented by the 
National Dialogue Commission. 
  It is also reported that some parties may withdraw from this 
conference to protest this amended article six of the draft 
proposal on the platform. All these reports give an idea of the 
general atmosphere here at the Palais des Nations and constitute 
food for discussion for all journalists and political analysts. 
Thank you. We will be back at 2000 [1900 GMT].

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified correspondent at National Conference </F>
news conference by National Conference spokesman Abdelkader 
Bensalah] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Good evening ladies and 
gentlemen, 1,235 people participated in the national conference. 
The official spokesman of the conference has announced that the 
dissolved Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] is not present in the 
conference, contrary to the rumor. The conference is setting up 
its committees. Only two hours ago, HAMAS [Islamic Society 
Movement], the PRA [Party of Algerian Renewal], and the MDRA 
[Democratic Movement for the Renewal of Algeria] withdrew from 
the conference. [passage omitted] 
  The conference proceedings were opened by Youcef Khatib, 
chairman of the National Dialogue Commission, with a welcoming 
speech in which he said: 
  [Begin Khatib recording] This not the time for one-upmanship 
or bargaining because the issue concerns first and foremost the 
fate of Algeria. The present circumstances thus require unity of 
ranks to confront all the challenges facing the country. Oh 
brothers and sisters, we do not doubt at all and everybody has 
got the good intention. However, the required results from all 
parties have not been realized completely despite the efforts 
made by the National Dialogue Commission. In my name and on 
behalf of all the members of the National Dialogue Commission, I 
thank all the parties which have dealt with us with all 
seriousness and sincerity." [end recording] [passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Abdelkader Bensalah, conference 
spokesman] 
The idea of the National Dialogue Commission was right from the 
beginning, to go into the depth of the matter and find out its 
facts with precision and caution in light of its importance and 
seriousness. The Commission has always had the conviction that 
dealing with this matter required time and patience at the same 
time. The Commission has, through its endeavors toward this 
Islamic tendency registered tangible results, the most important 
of which is represented in the latter's acceptance of dialogue 
as a principle and as a political method to deal with this 
problem and the need to arrive gradually at its solution. From 
these premises, the Commission has embodied this option, i.e. 
that of continuing dialogue when it included it in the platform 
for national consensus. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] The official spokesman concluded his speech 
by stressing the need to adhere to dialogue as a positive means 
to ensure its continuation and deepening by the transitional 
bodies, considering that the dialogue is a pressing need for 
dealing with all parties. After this, opportunity was given to 
journalists to ask questions, and the national spokesman 
declined to answer some of them considering that they were 
premature. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The event today is the holding of the national 
consensus conference. In its first day, the proceedings were 
held this morning in an open session addressed by Higher State 
Council Ali Kafi, after the conference was opened by Youcef 
Khatib, chairman of the National Dialogue Commission. This 
afternoon's proceedings are being held behind closed doors. We 
will now try to get in touch with our correspondents at the 
Palais des Nations with the latest developments: 
  [Correspondent] Yes, Rachid. Ladies and gentlemen, God's 
peace and mercy be upon you. This afternoon's proceedings come 
in in two different forms, namely what goes on inside the hall 
behind closed doors and what goes on behind the scenes, 
including the unofficial reports which have been circulating 
about the identity of the next head of state. Things are also 
happening inside the hall for news conferences where three 
personalities have turned up so far, and they were the 
rapporteur of the National Dialogue Commission, the leader of 
the Party of Algerian Renewal, and the leader of HAMAS (Islamic 
Society Movement). 
  The journalists, who have been kept away from the conference 
hall, have tried to find out whether the report on the 
appointment of the next head of state is true. According to 
rumors, the incumbent will be [former foreign minister] 
Abdelaziz Bouteflika. The report has not been confirmed or 
denied by official quarters. However, what is certain is that 
the text of the draft proposal on the platform for national 
consensus has been amended on the issue of the head of state who 
will now be appointed by the Higher Security Council. [passage 
omitted] 
  The rapporteur of the National Dialogue Commission was very 
reluctant to reply to some questions particularly those relating 
to the reported appointment of Abdelaziz Bouteflika. He only 
said that replying to such a question would be premature. 
  This afternoon's session was also marked by the news that 
two 
other parties, the Party of Algerian Renewal and HAMAS [Islamic 
Society Movement], have also withdrawn from the conference. Our 
colleague Mohsin Slimani will clarify the reasons of these 
withdrawals in the following report: 
  [Slimani] Indeed. The Party of Algerian Renewal and HAMAS 
movement, which took part in today's proceedings, have announced 
their withdrawal from the national conference for different 
reasons. Nourredine Boukrouh, the leader of the Party of 
Algerian Renewal, indicated at a news conference that the 
national conference has lost its credibility in that the 
participants have found themselves in a position of mere 
listeners. Boukrouh added that his withdrawal was also due to 
the fact that the crucial decisions were taken in advance behind 
the scenes, as he put it. He further said that the head of 
state was also appointed behind the scenes. 
  Despite its opposition to the way the conference has been 
organized, the Party of Algerian Renewal said that it considers 
itself concerned by the real dialogue which he urged the new 
head of state to open with representatives of the dissolved 
Islamic Salvation Front. In the same context, but for different 
reasons, HAMAS movement leader Mahfouz Nahnah announced the 
withdrawal of his party from the conference. However, Mahfouz 
Nahnah said that his movement is committed to a dialogue in 
which all the active sides will take part. As regards the 
political forces, the leader of the Islamic Society Movement 
held the political parties also responsible for the failure of 
the national conference, which everybody is talking about now. 
Likewise, Nahnah held the authorities responsible for that too. 
On the whole, Mahfouz Nahnah regarded the participation of 
HAMAS as positive since it enabled him to reiterate the 
principles of his party and it revealed to him the dimensions of 
the conference or what he described as some actions [as heard]. 
The national conference, Nahnah said, is devoid of any 
political aspect as a result of the decision of the major 
parties to boycott the conference. He added that he has refused 
to adopt such an attitude saying: We do not want to be the 
attendants of any political movement. [passage omitted] 
  Here follows an excerpt from the statement made by Mahfouz 
Nahnah, leader of HAMAS movement: 
  [Begin Nahnah recording] We hoped, from the beginning, that 
the dialogue would be national, as I said, and political and not 
based on groups and associations. The conference could well 
benefit from these groups and these associations, but we believe 
that these cannot be the core of the dialogue in the absence of 
the partners to the dialogue. We also believe that this 
operation is unlikely to achieve the minimum that would maintain 
the value of this dialogue. However, we strongly believe that 
this national conference -- supposedly national and supposedly 
political -- has now whetted the appetite of those who wanted to 
join a wider dialogue in the future so as to sow hope, spread 
compassion, reassure the masses yearning for security and 
stability, and put Algeria in its rightful place among the 
peoples and the nations. For the aforementioned reasons, we 
announce, on behalf of the HAMAS delegation and after taking 
part for a whole day, our withdrawal from the proceeedings of 
this conference, and not our withdrawal from an open, broad, 
comprehensive and in-depth dialogue. [end recording] 
  [Slimani] In the same context, we will now listen to the 
statement made by Noureddine Boukrouh, leader of the Party of 
Algerian Renewal: 
  [Begin Boukrouh recording] We are not concerned by the 
results of this conference, we will not get involved in the work 
of the committees which have been set up, and we are withdrawing 
from the conference this evening. We did not want to do it in a 
sensational way and surprise people. We decided against that 
and we gave our analysis not in a sensational way because 
we are people keen on analysis and we are coherent 
[italicized words in French]. We tried to do it in the best 
possible way. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Correspondent] The rapporteur 
of the National Dialogue Commission [Abdelkader Bensalah, 
official spokesman of the national conference] confirmed that 
the dialogue is continuing and that the conference is not the 
end of it. 
  [Begin Bensalah recording] This conference is not an end 
itself but is a means in the framework of the dialogue which 
will continue even after the convening of this conference. 
[passage omitted] [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] But other information has appeared following 
the statement of the commission's spokesman. These carried 
other signs which could be promising. Shaban Lunak. 
  [Lunak] We were not mistaken in our previous reports, but 
we, 
like other men of information at the Palace des Nations, 
followed the first hours of the proceedings of the national 
consensus conference. We are still under the spell of the 
surprise which could happen. All readings and analyses have 
moved from the limits of possible optimism to the thunderbolt of 
eminent failure. [as heard] [passage omitted] 
  After what has been said about this issue, we can say today 
that the contacts which took place between the constituents of 
the dissolved Islamic Salvation Front and the National Dialogue 
Commission took place without any mediators, parties or 
independent figures, as was rumored. [passage omitted] 
  [Algiers Radio Algiers Network in Arabic at 2300 GMT on 24 
January, in another report on the conference, adds: "We have 
learned that the Islamic Arab Rally has decided to suspend its 
participation in the national conference."]

  [Text] Our correspondent has informed us that the National 
Constitutional Rally, which is a coalition of 11 parties, has 
decided to withdraw from the conference after it became clear 
that parties which have a say in the procedures were absent. It 
is also expected that two committees will be set up, one in 
charge of the national consensus platform and the other one in 
charge of the institutions of the transitional period.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hocine Ait Ahmed, secretary general of the </F>
Socialist Forces Front, by unidentifed correspondent in Paris -- 
live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Civil peace is still a dream in 
Algeria. The national conference which opened in Algiers today 
is national in name only. The major parties are boycotting it. 
Our guest, Hocine Ait Ahmed will tell us why. [passage omitted] 
  Hocine Ait Ahmed, you are in Paris, and not in Algiers. Why 
are you boycotting the conference? I recall that you are the 
secretary general of the Socialist Forces Front. 
  [Ait Ahmed] Listen, we started to take part in the dialogue 
aimed at organizing this conference. It appeared that there was 
no dialogue, neither on the form nor on the substance; it was a 
monologue. Those who were in charge of conducting this dialogue 
did not want to make concessions. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Why don't you take the opportunity of this 
conference to say it openly and publicly in front of all the 
media? 
  [Ait Ahmed] We said a long time ago that missing the 
opportunity offered by this conference was an enormous political 
mistake. It was we, if you remember, who called for a national 
conference two years ago. The way we perceived the conference 
was that it should be composed of the army, which is the real 
power with the power of decision, and the representative 
parties. It was up to the conference to establish the new 
structure and the presidential body. As soon as we were certain 
that all the transition structures and the form that the 
presidency would take were already decided upon behind the 
scenes, and that we would be there for the sole purpose of being 
a rubber stamp... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] What you say means that dialogue 
is impossible. So does this mean that you are giving a free 
hand to extremists of all kinds? 
  [Ait Ahmed] Listen, the jokes...[pauses] It is the regime 
that is giving ammunition to the extremists. They have showed 
the most stunning disdain of the people in staging a farce in 
the name of a national conference. 
  [Correspondent] Is Algeria in a civil war? 
  [Ait Ahmed] Algeria is not in a civil war but it is running 
the risk of getting there. It is not in a civil war because the 
Algerian people do not wish to embark on such a path. One side 
of the Algerian population is not taking arms against another, 
whatever the effort of the regime to involve the population. 
  [Correspondent] Still, could it happen? 
  [Ait Ahmed] Well, all the ingredients are there, above all 
the high cost of living and a social situation whose extent one 
cannot imagine. 
  [Correspondent] You are asking for democratic elections. 
  [Ait Ahmed] Yes. 
  [Correspondent] What if these democratic elections result in 
favor of the enemies of democracy, that is, the fundamentalist 
militants? 
  [Ait Ahmed] The whole problem lies there. This is the 
pretext the regime used to justify the coup d'etat, to say there 
will not be civilian peace without us. Well, not only have they 
failed to establish civil peace but they also indefinitely 
postponed the return to the democratic process. Now it is clear 
that after a two-year transition resulting from the democratic 
process, they want to extend it to another three-year 
transition. This is proof that they do not want any democracy; 
therefore the country is running a higher risk of total collapse. 
  [Correspondent] What do you expect from France and Europe? 
  [Ait Ahmed] Listen, we expect Europe to apply the law. The 
principle of respect for human rights and the democratic 
principles are for everyone. We have seen big movements of 
solidarity with the people of eastern Europe in the West. As 
far as Algeria is concerned, it is as if its people do not 
deserve any attention. It is true that the Algerian problem 
should be solved by the Algerians, by all sides. We notice that 
the regime has not ceased asking for financial and economic aid. 
It cannot ask for favorable treatment for itself and at the 
same time for a discriminatory one for the people. Human rights 
and democracy should triumph in the country. 
  [Correspondent] In one word, Mr. Ait Ahmed: Are you 
pessimistic? 
  [Ait Ahmed] I am pessimistic if the international community 
continues to be fooled by the regime. But I am completely 
optimistic if the means to establish democracy are given to us. 
There are democratic forces in Algerian society. All they need 
is the means to express and freely organize themselves. I am 
ready to commit myself. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you Mr. Ait Ahmed for the interview.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "On Eve of Dialogue Conference in </F>
Algeria: Bouteflika `Only Candidate' for Presidency?"] 
  [Excerpts] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Competent organs in 
Algeria are working to open the national dialogue conference 
tomorrow, Tuesday [25 Jan], despite the decision by the National 
Liberation Front [FLN], the Socialist Forces Front, the Islamic 
Salvation Front, and a number of small parties not to take part 
in it. [passage omitted] 
  Political and media circles in Algeria are asking on the eve 
of the national conference about the "new successor" of 'Ali 
Kafi, chairman of the Higher State Council [HCE], whose term 
terminates on 31 January. 
  Abdelaziz Bouteflika (foreign minister in the days of the 
late President Houari Boumedienne and member of the FLN Central 
Committee) is still the name mentioned in official state circles 
in Algeria, especially after his meeting with the military 
establishment and his "temporary" nomination to lead the 
transitional phase. 
  A reliable source has told AL-HAYAH that the military 
establishment has accepted the conditions set by Bouteflika. 
They are: 
  1. To appoint him by the military establishment as 
president, and that his appointment should not be based on a 
proposal from the national conference scheduled to be held 
tomorrow. 
  2. To grant him all the powers granted to the president of 
the republic in accordance with the present Constitution. He 
does not accept the formula for collective power sharing 
represented in the five-member Higher State Council or the one 
proposed in the "document on the dialogue terms," which 
stipulated the existence of one or two vice presidents. 
  3. To work in accordance with the present Constitution, 
which should not be amended. And the "document on dialogue 
terms" should not be adopted as a new constitution. 
  4. To grant him full powers to appoint or dismiss the prime 
minister. 
  5. Not to impose on him the formula proposed in the 
"document on dialogue terms" with regard to the transitional 
national assembly appointed by the parties, organizations, and 
associations participating in the national conference. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Algiers, Jan 26 (AFP) -- Algerian former foreign 
minister Abdelaziz Bouteflika has turned down a proposal to 
become the country's president for a three-year transitional 
period, an official spokesman said Wednesday [26 Jan]. 
  Bouteflika, 59, who served under the 1965-78 presidency of 
Houari Boumediene, had been mooted as the man most likely to 
take up the post, with the approval of the armed forces. 
  Abdelkadar Bensalah, spokesman for a national conference 
organised by the government but boycotted by all the main 
political parties, announced that the gathering, meeting for the 
second and final day, "has been informed of this refusal."

  [Text] The battles in Afghanistan have subsided. Our 
correspondent reports on the latest developments there: 
  Sources from the two warring sides present contradictory 
reports about the outcome of battles during the last two days. 
Both sides, however, confirm that battles in Kabul during the 
last 48 hours have left hundreds of people dead or injured. An 
official of the Ministry of Intelligence and Culture [as heard], 
who is close to the Afghan president, said today: Forces 
opposing the government have been forced to retreat from the 
positions they occupied on the first day of the battles. 
Furthermore, he said, 200 fighters of the [Afghanistan Islamic 
Revolution] Coordination Council have been killed. 
  Meanwhile, a spokesman for Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of 
Afghanistan] said that in the battles during the last two days a 
number of areas, such as the Microryan residential estate, the 
senior officers' training complex, Hidgah mosque and parts of 
the Hudkheyl area have been captured by the forces of the 
Coordination Council. He added: A large number of forces loyal 
to the government have been killed or wounded in the process, 
and tens of corpses still litter the battle grounds. The 
spokesman also announced: A Scud surface-to-surface missile was 
fired from Mazar Sharif toward positions held by Sayyaf's Hezb-e 
Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union] forces in the Karizmir area, 
near Paghman. He added: Paghman, situated west of Kabul, has 
also been bombarded by General Dostam's aircraft. 
  Meanwhile, reports indicate that during yesterday and today 
a 
Coordination Council delegation to Islamabad met and conferred 
with the ambassadors of France, America, Russia, and England, 
the UN envoy in charge of Afghan affairs, and an Islamic 
Conference Organization delegation. It was announced that these 
meetings with foregin ambassadors and envoys are taking place in 
order to enable the Council to explain its stances, while at the 
same time it is hoped that ways of establishing a cease-fire in 
Kabul will be achieved through these meetings.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Israeli statements reeking of 
stubbornness, shiftiness, and threats were made on the eve of 
the talks between chief delegates to the Washington peace talks. 
General 'Uzi Dayan said: If the peace talks remain in crisis, 
the Israeli military is braced for the contingency of war. Gen. 
Amnon Shahaq said he did not foresee any change to the status of 
the occupied Golan Heights this year. Uri Lubrani, the chief 
Israeli negotiator with Lebanon, said those pressing for 
implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 425 do not care 
for peace. 
  Observers a re unanimous that the Washington talks are about 
exploring ways to terminate Israeli occupation of Arab 
territories and bring peace to the Middle East. They are agreed 
that as long as Israel continues to balk at the requirement of a 
complete withdrawal, peace will remain an impossibility. The 
Arabs did not join the peace process or go to Washington to 
appease Israel or indulge its wishes. They went to get their 
occupied territories back and promote an enforcement of 
pertinent Security Council resolutions. Syria wants the entire 
Golan Heights back. Lebanon and Jordan also want to regain 
sovereignty over their occupied territories, no matter how small 
these may appear to be. Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, 
and 425 -- the mainstays of any fair and universal settlement in 
the Middle East -- require an immediate Israeli pullout from the 
occupied Arab territory and an end to settlement activity. What 
is the point of the Washington talks if they are not about 
finding ways to implement these resolutions, remove the 
occupation, and clear the path to peace? Does Israel really 
think that the Arabs will define the shape of peace they want 
before the Israelis make a public commitment to a complete 
withdrawal as called for by UN resolutions? 
  Those who talk about peace being in crisis and raise the 
specter of war are not interested in making peace. If the peace 
is in crisis, this is thanks to Israel itself. It is thanks to 
Israeli stubbornness that the two-year-old Washington talks have 
hit an impasse. Had Israel proved receptive to a global 
inclination for peace, Middle East peace would now be an 
established fact. The Geneva al-Asad-Clinton summit has charted 
the course of true peace and given added strength to 
international efforts to that end. 
  If only Israel would end its intransigence and begin to act 
as if is bound by Security Council resolutions instead of 
creating obstacles and threatening a referendum on the Golan and 
talking about a crisis that may erupt in war. The shortest 
route to peace lies in the implementation of the underpinnings 
of the peace process -- Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, 
and 425, which are best summed up in the land-for-peace formula. 
If Israel has trouble relinquishing its expansionist blueprints 
and handing back the occupied Arab territories, how can it 
realistically expect the Arabs to concede their land, rights, 
and tradition, and bow to aggression, when they are impatient to 
see peace established so that they can return to their land and 
homes? 
  Syria has called for the peace of the brave. Israel must 
realize that unless it displays a degree of courage commensurate 
with the cause of peace, Middle East peace will remain an 
unrealizable dream. However, belligerence and saber-rattling on 
the one hand and courage on the other are strange bedfellows. 
But if the Israelis reconcile themselves to hard facts and stop 
showing racial hatreds and belligerent tendencies, they will be 
truly courageous. All the world is waiting for the Israeli 
rulers to adopt a positive stand in keeping with international 
law and the sanctity of the cause of peace.

  [Text] Gentlemen: The Washington talks among heads of 
delegations concerned with the peace process in the Middle East 
are continuing. Syria, through the head of its delegation, 
reiterated its firm stand toward the bases of a just and 
comprehensive peace. It reaffirmed that the full return of the 
occupied Syrian Golan Heights to the homeland is a basic 
condition for the success of ongoing efforts. In fact, Syria's 
stand from now on does not need any explanation or 
reaffirmation. It has been the same stand since the launching 
of the U.S. peace initiative that led to the Madrid conference. 
It is the same stand expressed in the Syrian working paper 
presented during the sixth round of the Washington talks, which 
is still the only acknowledged working paper on which the talks 
are conducted. It is also the same stand embodied by President 
al-Asad at the Geneva summit when he called for the peace of the 
brave--a peace that removes Israeli occupation and restores 
usurped rights to their owners. 
  During the Geneva summit, Syria, represented by President 
al-Asad, categorically, unequivocally, and clearly expressed its 
commitment to achieving a just and comprehensive peace and its 
response to all the requisites of such a peace. Meanwhile, 
Israel so far has not taken the anticipated and necessary step 
to push the peace process forward, that is, through an 
announcement of its full willingness to withdraw from the 
occupied Arab territories. Indeed, what we heard from Israeli 
officials does not foster optimism. These officials sought to 
cast doubts on Syria's intentions and on the use of the Geneva 
summit. They proposed holding a referendum in the Golan, as if 
the occupiers have the right to hold a referendum on territory 
that has been Syrian since time immemorial and that remains an 
inseparable part of Syria. About 150,000 Syrian evacuees are 
waiting for peace to prevail in order to return to the Golan and 
live normal lives in their homes and territory. 
  The head of the Israeli delegation to the Washington talks 
said that the atmosphere was positive and encouraging. This is 
because Syria affirmed its absolute commitment to an honorable 
peace in the Middle East. However, it also affirmed its 
adherence to a comprehensive solution on all the conflict's 
fronts and to the return of the Golan Heights to its people. In 
fact, it is impossible to talk about positive and encouraging 
atmospheres without an Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal 
from the Golan and without Israel's actual involvement in the 
peace process by fully responding to the Security Council 
resolutions and showing willingness to meticulously implement 
these resolutions. Israeli officials so far have not promised a 
full withdrawal, but instead have talked about a form of 
withdrawal. Syria, as everyone knows, will not relinquish an 
inch of its territory or any of its rights. It will never accept 
a compromise solution in the Golan that leads to sharing this 
Syrian territory and rewarding the aggressor for his aggression. 
  Syria responded to the U.S. request to resume the Washington 
talks on the level of chief delegates. This is because the 
United States is absolutely and clearly committed to the 
comprehensiveness of the solution, to the Security Council 
resolutions, and to the land-for-peace principle. U.S. 
President Bill Clinton reaffirmed these commitments. He said 
that a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East is a 
first priority for his government and that the United States 
will exert every effort possible to achieve the desired 
honorable peace. Here, we should recall that during the Geneva 
summit, President Clinton supported President al-Asad's call to 
achieve the peace of the brave and considered it the only way to 
achieve stability in the region. 
  The United States is playing a major role in pushing the 
peace process forward and rendering it a success. Hence, the 
positive results people are eagerly anticipating depend on 
Israel. When the latter abandons its policy of evasion, 
prevarication, and procrastination, puts an end to its useless 
maneuvers such as the idea of holding a referendum on the Golan, 
and pledges to implement the Security Council resolutions and to 
end the occupation, only then will peace be at hand. 
  Peace serves the interest of all. It serves the interest of 
the countries in the region, the world community, and the United 
States itself. The stability of the world stems from the 
stability of the Middle East. It is no coincidence or 
complement that peace in our region is at the top of the U.S. 
Administration's list of priorities.

general and the depth of relations between the Armed Forces of 
the two friendly countries in particular. He noted the need to 
support and develop the Jordanian Armed Forces to enable them to 
assume their significant role of protecting security and 
stability in the region and preserving the democratic march in 
Jordan. 
  His majesty reviewed with the U.S. secretary designate the 
positive developments in the peace process, stressing the need 
to achieve the just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the 
Middle East region, which was for decades victim to conflict and 
tension. 
  His majesty voiced satisfaction with the progress of talks 
in 
the joint Jordanian-U.S. military committee and urged the U.S. 
side to show more understanding of the needs of the Jordanian 
Armed Forces and the need to develop them in order to enable 
them to bear their responsibilities in protecting security and 
stability in the region. 
  For his part, the U.S. secretary of defense designate 
stressed that his country understands and appreciates Jordan's 
prominent and important role in protecting security and 
stability in the region and contribution toward peace in the 
Middle East. He also voiced appreciation of the role played by 
the Jordanian Armed Forces in this regard and his country's 
interest in supporting and developing these forces to enable 
them to continue to shoulder their responsibilities. He 
stressed that the U.S. team on the joint U.S.-Jordanian military 
committee will work hand in hand with the Jordanian team to 
specify the means of backing and developing the Jordanian Armed 
Forces. 
  The meeting was attended for Jordan by Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam 
al-Majali, the prime minister; al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, chief 
of the Royal Hashemite Court; Marwan al-Qasim, his majesty the 
king's political adviser; Dr. Fayiz al-Tarawinah, Jordan's 
ambassador in Washington; and General 'Abd-al-Hafiz Mar'i 
al-Ka'abinah, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
  The meeting was attended on the U.S. side by General 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff; Frank 
Wisner, deputy secretary of defense for political affairs; and a 
number of U.S. Defense Department officials.

  [Excerpt] His Majesty King Husayn today received Qatari 
Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al Thani at 
his place of residence in Washington. 
  During the meeting, his majesty stressed to the minister the 
need for Arab coordination, as well as the need to revive 
solidarity and unify the stands and views of the Arab brothers, 
particularly at this critical phase in the life of the Arab 
nation. He said the challenges facing the nation dictate that 
efforts and energies should be pooled together to ensure the 
minimum level of Arab solidarity and coordination that would 
benefit all peoples of the nation, strengthen the ties existing 
among them, and protect the interests of the nation and its 
future generations. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Text" of a meeting between King Husayn and several leaders </F>
of the U.S. Jewish community in Washington on 24 January -- 
recorded; in English] 
  [Text] [Husayn] Ladies and gentlemen, it really is a 
pleasure for me to have this opportunity together with [Queen] 
Nur, the prime minister of Jordan, members of our Jordanian 
group on this visit to Washington, to meet with you, and I hope 
that in the spirit of friendship and optimism that we have for 
the present and the future regarding the tremendous and 
important developments that have occurred of late in our part of 
the world, which I hope will see us coming together as the 
children of Abraham in a land and an area that has had such an 
impact on civilization and on mankind [sentence as heard]. I am 
happy that this meeting takes place, and I have had the pleasure 
in the past, from time to time, to meet some of you. I 
certainly hope that we will meet again regularly, that we will 
convey also my feelings of determination, on one hand, and total 
commitment to the cause of a just, honorable, lasting peace that 
future generations can live with, can protect, can enjoy in our 
region; our determination to achieve this goal; and our optimism 
despite the difficulties over the fact that there is no other 
option. There is no other alternative. The growing realization 
of this fact in our region, amongst all peoples, and beyond 
that, it's our duty to do whatever we can for the generations to 
come beyond, to give them a better chance, to give them a better 
life, to give them what they deserve long after we are gone. 
  We welcome you to this meeting, and we hope that we will 
convey to our friends in the United States our greetings and the 
essence of our hopes and determination to make progress toward 
the attainment of peace. Rather than continue myself now any 
further, I would like to give everyone the opportunity, and to 
start -- well some of you might have known whenever we have met 
in the past -- to start a dialogue and maybe to answer any 
questions that you may have. Once again, you are most welcomed. 
Thank you so much. [applause] 
  [Unidentified speaker] Your majesty, we (?met) with you a 
number of times in the past, in the 80's, and also at occasions. 
It was very clear to us, as it has been to the State of Israel, 
that the Kingdom of Jordan, under the right circumstances, was 
ready to enter into peaceful arrangements with the State of 
Israel, even as you made clear to us every time we met that it 
is not for Jordan--it was not for you--to negotiate on behalf of 
the Palestinians. An obstacle has been removed. There is now 
someone to negotiate with. And may I now, on behalf of all of 
us here, simply wish your majesty and her majesty the queen a 
life of good health, a long life, and a life which sees where 
you and we can see, not only that the State of Israel and the 
Kingdom of Jordan are living in peace together, but that both of 
them are living in a peaceful and prosperous Middle East. I 
don't want to ask you any questions, but if I can be of help in 
finding those who do.... Mr. (Smarling). 
  [(Smarling)] Your majesty: Last Friday, the crown prince had 
an interview that was published in the Israeli press. And he 
said some words that were very moving to us and also--we 
know--to many Israelis. The crown prince said we want a warm 
peace with Israel, and he mentioned some of the projects--the 
economic projects--that would be part of a warm peace. Could 
you elaborate a little bit on this, about what a warm peace 
means to you? And what would be some of its components? 
  [Husayn] Thank you very much indeed, Sir. And once again, 
may I thank you for your comments and say how happy I am, Sir, 
that we meet again under these circumstances here in Washington 
at this very exciting and very, very interesting moment. You 
are quite right, Sir, in terms of the problem as it evolved. We 
have always sought, to the best of our abilities, to promote the 
cause of a just, comprehensive peace in our region. After the 
adoption of Security Council Resolution 242, we tried our very 
best to see its implementation through. That, unfortunately, 
was not possible at the time. Israel looked at us as a country 
that had been one that had actually occupied another land and 
had been driven out of it. In 1974, an Arab summit saw the whole 
Arab world respond to a Palestinian wish that they speak for 
themselves regarding their future. And so we acceded to that, 
and I have honored our commitment there ever since. Our Israeli 
neighbors, at a certain moment in time, following 1974, started 
to ask us to be the negotiating partner over Palestinian affairs 
and Palestinian fate and future. But it was impossible. So it 
has taken all these years until finally Madrid, following the 
tremendous events that occurred in our world and the growing 
realization in the area that we must really resolve this 
problem. Madrid, and we provided the umbrella for the 
Palestinians to enable them to speak for themselves. And 
Moscow. And the multilaterals. And then Washington. And, as 
you say, September 13th, a tremendous step forward. And I have 
described it as a very courageous one by Israel and by the 
Palestinians in terms of mutual recognition and the beginning of 
a process. So we supported that and will continue to support 
it. And again, Sir, we have, in terms of the facts, 
we've....[pauses] Go back to Madrid, we started at the same 
point, all of us, all the parties concerned. Palestine and the 
Palestinian cause has been very, very close to our hearts and is 
[words indistinct]. September 13th is of great significance 
because it saw the Palestinians move on their own and begin a 
process. September 14th saw us ratify an agenda that had been 
held back until we saw some progress on the Palestinian-Israeli 
dimension. The agenda is not a peace treaty. The agenda is 
areas of concern to all of us. But we hope very sincerely that 
we will see progress on all the items in that agenda as rapidly 
as possible to arrive at satisfactory answers and solutions to 
all the problems there. We have suggested that we will 
implement whatever we agree upon, that there should be symmetry 
-- the problems should be placed in baskets here and there. But 
we should ensure that we sensitize people to the results of 
peace and to the promise of peace as we move along. 
Unfortunately, in the minds of some, this might have created 
the impression that we are talking about arrangements, 
agreements here and there that would be implemented, but that we 
are not committed to ratifying a peace treaty. I would like to 
say categorically here that we are committed, at the end of the 
process, once we have resolved all these problems, that the 
crowning achievement will be the ratification of a peace treaty. 
  I don't believe there is any contradiction between that 
fact and the fact that we have always sought a comprehensive 
settlement in the region and that we will work and do our utmost 
to ensure that that comes within that context as well, so that 
the whole area moves from where we are to where we should be--to 
where we should have been. 
  The areas of concern, Sir, are many. But, let me give you an 
example of what my brother, probably, had in mind, and what I 
have examined with my colleagues, what we have talked about in 
Jordan. For example, we have a border problem, and in particular 
in the southern area, the Dead Sea right down to the Gulf of 
al-'Aqabah. Well, in the period after 1967, Israeli forces sort 
of moved into Jordanian territory without war, without fighting. 
For security reasons, we couldn't do very much about it at that 
time, but we registered the fact. We would like to see progress 
made as soon as possible to resolve this particular problem--the 
problem of territorial sovereignty, of border demarcation and 
delineation. We are calling for a committee to look at this 
subject as rapidly as possible, and I hope that this will lead, 
obviously, to meetings on the ground there at important high 
levels. Once this is done--as opposed to suggestions that maybe 
Jordan can lease land--Jordan cannot. This is Jordanian land. 
Then, we will look at the whole Rift Valley as an economic 
unit, and we will look at everything that we can do to make it 
so. To see what benefits can be derived of our joint efforts to 
make that one of the most important elements of the coming 
peace, be it in terms of mineral resources, in terms of 
communications, in terms of the environment, in terms of -- so 
many other elements that would come along, as well. 
  This is something that we hope will happen and will begin to 
see realized sometime soon, and this leads onto the 
environmental questions, fighting desertification and dealing 
with that. Another area is water, and that is very, very 
important to all of us. So, again, we hope that very, very soon 
we will concentrate on that and see what can be done to ensure 
that the future is bright, at least in terms of the rights of 
all of us, on one hand, and then what can be done beyond that 
because I don't believe that the resources available in the area 
are sufficient to all of us. This is a problem that is very 
much on our minds. We cannot ignore it, and we have to look at 
other ways and means by which we can provide the water that is 
needed within our region. 
  In the Camp David accords, there is an area or an item that 
deals with a road that would link Egypt, and therefore Arab 
North Africa, with the Arab World and that would pass through 
Elat. We have suggested recently that: Why not? Let us look at 
that at this time and, hopefully, see what can be done because 
that will be a very important step forward, as well. There are 
many other related issues and possibilities. Nothing has been 
settled, nothing has been discussed, maybe, in-depth as yet, 
but, for example, we were looking at linking our national grid 
system with the Egyptian one through a cable under the Gulf of 
al-'Aqabah. Do we need to do that now? Or can we look at a much 
more logical way of approaching this particular problem? 
Tourism, movement of people. 
  These are just some areas which my brother probably touched 
on in his thoughts as he made the statements to the Israeli 
paper, I believe the YEDI'OT AHARANOT, if I am not mistaken, in 
Amman. The other important element, of course, is the question 
of people. I think we all know that Jordan has borne the 
results of every disaster that has beset our area and our region 
and has had an impact on the Palestinians, our brethren. We are 
very anxious to see what can be done and to bring about a change 
in the quality of life. The priority has to go, obviously, to 
Gaza and the West Bank, to the occupied territories. But beyond 
that, we have to look at the whole region and what can peace 
bring with it. On the human level in that regard, there is a 
pending problem, as well, which we hope to address, and that is 
the reunification of families, in terms of those who legally 
should be reunited with their families in the occupied 
territories. There is so much that is being done, so much that 
we are doing to the best of our abilities, in every area, and I 
hope that the results, not only of our efforts, but of the 
commitment and efforts of all concerned, will produce the 
results that all of us hope, something entirely different and 
may be too difficult for me to speak about in terms of 
limitations or scope at such a meeting. 
  [(Sigmond)] You stressed in your comments the importance of 
comprehensiveness, and you said that you would like to see the 
whole area move from where we are to where we ought to be. In 
the past, this principle of comprehensiveness has served as an 
element to moving the area from where it is to where it ought to 
be because of the reluctance on the part of many of the players 
to take initiatives that would move the process forward for fear 
that the rest of the Arab world is not moving along. To what 
extent do you believe in the light of the agreement on September 
13th, more recently the meeting between President al-Asad and 
President Clinton and what was said there, to what extent does 
this free bilateral movement that is not dependent on the most 
common denominator in the region? Could you speak to us on that 
subject? 
  [Husayn] Thank you very much indeed, and I once again very 
happy indeed that the level of confidence in the area and 
dialogue that is going on at this time is something that I have 
not seen over the years. If you take Jordan and Syria, for 
example, we are constantly in touch. I am very happy to hear 
the results of the meeting between President Clinton and 
President al-Asad. I have every confidence that there is, on 
behalf of the Arab parties concerned, a total desire and 
commitment to the cause of a just comprehensive peace. So I 
personally see that it is going to begin to manifest itself 
hopefully sometime soon in terms of real progress on other 
tracks. But in that regard, I wanted to make it abundantly 
clear. As far as we are concerned, we are moving. We started 
at the same point. We have the same objective. We are moving 
on our own to deal with all the problems that we have to deal 
with and address, leading to the ratification of a peace treaty 
as a crowning achievement. We would certainly hope and pray 
that our efforts will also succeed in encouraging others to move 
and in seeing other movement in a meaningful way so that we 
arrive at our objective that we have sought for so long, of a 
comprehensive peace. But regarding the seriousness of the 
Jordanians in terms of the negotiating process now, we are very 
serious, we are determined, and we will put our best efforts to 
see rapid movement and achieve results. The timeframe is beyond 
me to be able to determine at this stage, but I hope it would 
not be long before we see that happen. So, in other words, we 
are not tying ourselves down to anything except the 
determination to move and more rapidly. We hope and we believe 
and we will work for our efforts to result in peace, and, at the 
same time, hopefully we will see that not only on the Jordanian- 
or Palestinian-Israeli track but also regarding Syria and 
Lebanon so that we have finally what we have always sought, a 
comprehensive peace in the region. In other words, we are our 
own masters in terms of our fate and our destiny. We are 
determined to do whatever we can, but we believe that in the 
interest of all and future generations in the region and in the 
interest of the security of all the coming generations, we have 
to work for a comprehensive peace. That does not mean that we 
should wait until everybody else deals with their problems, we 
are also approaching these problems very, very seriously. 
  There has been some ambiguity or some difference of opinion 
or some cause for confusion. We have been called upon to ratify 
a peace treaty. Some suggestions were that we should ratify it 
on this visit of mine, here, on the occasion of my visit to the 
United States for a medical checkup. And very frankly my 
friends, I don't believe this is the right approach. We do not 
ratify a peace treaty and then begin to negotiate what it should 
contain. We negotiate and work out all the problems so that you 
don't have any left once you have peace. And this is the way we 
are going about. Thank you, Sir. 
  [Al Moses] Al Moses, your Majesty. Could you foresee 
Jordan's role in the territories in the intermediate period and 
beyond. Is federation still a concept that has been [word 
indistinct]. Will Jordan have a significant economic role, 
beyond simply having the dinar the official currency. Do you 
foresee Jordanian banks as being the principle banking 
institutions in the territories; education for school children 
coming from your Ministry of Education and [words indistinct] so 
that you have a cultural, economic, and in time perhaps 
political bond between the territories and the Kingdom of 
Jordan, or do you see an independent Palestinian state that has 
friendly relations but is independent, culturally, economically, 
and politically with the Kingdom of Jordan? 
  [Husayn] I can only see, based on the very close relations 
of 
members of one family in that region, that the future will see 
us coming closer together. But with all due respect to all 
those who have suggested federation or confederation or any 
other formula at this stage, I have asked for example President 
'Arafat to drop that from his vocabulary when he talks with me 
the term confederation, because this does not come, Sir, as a 
result of the wish of an individual or even a group of people. 
This has got to be something that develops and matures over 
time. We are very, very close together, but there has been a 
lot of damage done over the years. Many misconceptions, many 
impressions that we had designs over the fate of our brethern. 
We had supported them and we will continue to support them to 
the best of our ability, will help. And the future has to be 
something that is built from the grassroots upwards. 
  So in the coming phase, I see our role as one of supporting 
Palestinians to the best of our ability, in every way we can, 
and helping them to move ahead and hopefully, eventually, people 
will work out what the relations ought to be. I personally 
believe that in Palestine, as is the case in Jordan, there is a 
yearning for democracy, there is a yearning for institutions 
that insure that people have a say regarding their future, that 
this is inevitable, this will come about. So may be it is 
premature to speak about how it will all shape up but I am sure 
the links and the ties are there and they will develop and grow. 
  In the meantime, as far as Jordan is concerned and all 
members of our Jordanian family, regardless of their origins, we 
shall remain one family. And we shall remain determined to 
ensure that nothing touches this fact in any form or way, 
adversely. If and when people have another option, have another 
choice, individually or collectively, then we will look at that 
and they are free to do whatever they wish. Jordan, as you 
know, is the only Arab state that shared everything with its 
Palestinian brethern and members of the Palestinian family. And 
again, we do have problems in terms of the long run. We have to 
ensure that people--if we are talking about the legalities of 
it--have the right to either return or be compensated or return 
and be compensated, or certainly be compensated. But somehow we 
hope that in the context of peace, in the context of movement to 
change the shape of things in our area, we will see a 
difference, we will see a change in the quality of life for 
people. We will see them have more chances to live the kind of 
life that they deserve, we will see the narrowing of gaps, and 
therefore, the removal of fears and suspicions that existed over 
so many years. We will see the children of Abraham come 
together in that part of the world and everywhere. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Your Majesty, many of us around the 
table who have been a kind of antidote to those in our community 
who would encourage the abandonment of the peace process, we 
ourselves were encouraged in September that, at the beginning of 
the process, we would see the alleviation of the Arab boycott 
against Israel in very serious ways. We understand that it is 
on the agenda of a meeting of the foreign ministers--we have 
read soon--and I wonder if you could please give some of your 
own insight and observation on the possibility of any level of 
that boycott being officially removed at that time, to help us 
out with our community. 
  [Husayn] Sure, Sir, and I think that it's a good idea to 
discuss this in the following way and may be to clarify again 
some of the misunderstandings about it. Sir, if you look at the 
Palestinian-Israeli dimension, or Jordan, Palestine, and Israel, 
it is something different to the boycott, let's say, of 
companies that have subsidiaries in Israel. I think that that 
kind of situation that might have lasted in the past is probably 
on the way towards being removed and addressed. But we have 
problems which, again, we have to discuss in the times ahead and 
it is I think an item of concern for us and hopefully will be 
part of the coming negotiations. For example, Sir, and 
practically since 1970, Israeli restrictions on Jordanian 
exports to the occupied territories has cost Jordan $2 billion, 
deficit. As a result of these policies, Israel has gained a 
trade surplus of 7.5 billion. So, what I'm trying to say is 
that we have two problems here, Sir. How do we address them, we 
hope that we will address the immediate one as it concerns us, 
and certainly the other one as it concerns other international 
concerns. I think that is being resolved very, very soon. I 
hope we will address this one to see that the protectionism that 
exists does not affect adversely the other side, and we have to 
work out something new and I hope that this will be addressed 
very, very soon. 
  [(Lynne Lev)] Your Majesty, one of the concerns that I think 
we all have in terms of how this will move forward is the 
increase in violence and the growth of fundamentalists? Could 
you respond to that and how you see it playing out and what can 
be done to reverse fundamentalists? 
  [Husayn] I believe, Madam, that this is the greatest 
challenge that we face on probably either side of the divide at 
this stage. There are those who believe that we must carry out 
our responsibilities now and bear them in terms of 
responsibility towards future generations. And there are those 
who, may be, live in the world of yesterday or today and cannot 
see what this opportunity means. I believe as we make progress, 
God willing, we will pass through this difficult phase and we 
will see that the peace camp on both sides gains the upper hand 
as it produces results that affect the future of peoples, all 
our people, in all the times to come. The challenge is there. 
The problem is one of sometimes despair or lack of vision or 
too much trauma of what has happened so far. But let's hope and 
pray that we can pass through that phase as rapidly as possible. 
And I believe that we have the capability and we have the 
determination and the staying power to go through it and see the 
breaking of a fresh dawn, a new dawn in our entire region and 
our lives. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Your Majesty, you have painted a bold 
and encouraging picture of the (?word) peace, and I think that 
this dialogue will contribute to the climate and momentum that 
will keep the specific negotiations moving forward. Not 
everyone in the Middle East is committed as you are to a 
comprehensive peace. I wonder if you might reflect a bit on the 
role of Iran in the current discussions taking place in the 
Middle East. 
  [Husayn] I wouldn't know what to say in this regard, Sir. 
Iran is outside the immediate area of the problem that we are 
trying to address. They may have their views. They haven't 
shared them with us, officially. Nor have we had the chance to 
debate them with them. But I believe that resolving our problem 
removes the root cause of instability in that entire region. 
And if you would look at the past many, many years, the problem 
has been the ladder to power by many ambitious individuals or 
groups that sought to gain power. 
  Again referring to the question of fundamentalism or 
extremism, I am very happy to see that, over a number of years, 
there is an interfaith dialogue that is covering much ground. 
And I think all of us realize that many acts and actions, taken 
in many different parts of the world, sometimes in the name of 
faith and religion, are so alien to everything we believe in and 
to the teaching of our religion. So let us hope that what can 
happen in our area can positively affect the rest of the world. 
It was a beacon. It was the source of illumination for the 
world in the past. Let us hope that this will happen again. It 
is worth our very best efforts, and hopefully we will succeed in 
making our contribution. 
  [Rabbi (Sapisti)] Your Majesty, could you reflect for a few 
moments on the role of the United States in the short run, what 
might it do to be helpful in enhancing the chances that the 
accord will be implemented and peace agreements will be signed? 
But in the long run, what role do you think the United States 
needs to play--militarily, politically, and/or economically--and 
what are some of the cautions that you give to the United States 
about things that it might be tempted to do that might be 
counterproductive? 
  [Husayn] It is very difficult for me to cover all these 
areas, Sir. But I think that, for a long period of time, the 
message we have heard in our part of the world is that we in the 
area need to address our own problems and that the United States 
is a partner. We welcome that, obviously, and welcome the help, 
assistance, concern, and interests of friends throughout the 
world. I believe that the United States is in a unique position 
now, shouldering so many responsibilities the world over. So we 
hope that they will continue to help to the best of their 
abilities and help us all move toward the establishment of a 
just, lasting peace that we have sought for so long. 
  I think, Sir, that in the context of peace, again, the 
opportunities are going to be tremendous for people the world 
over to benefit from the results of peace, on the moral level, 
on the human level, on every level. And the area could see us 
working together with our friends here and elsewhere in the 
world in trying to bring and succeeding in bringing about the 
kind of change that is in the interest of all our people and the 
future generations. 
  The military dimension of the problem again is being 
discussed in negotiations at this stage to create the kind of 
balance that has to be addressed to remove the threat 
of--hopefully in time--of weapons of mass destruction, wherever 
they may be, and to remove the cause for spending so much on 
military armaments at the expense of everything else and the 
needs of people. But the United States will continue to have a 
very, very important role to play, and we hope that we will 
encourage them to do so, realizing at the same time our own 
responsibilities directly in this matter. 
  [Unidentified speaker] Your Majesty, I believe I am quoting 
correctly, you said that before the treaty is consummated you 
must negotiate. That is a model that I believe Israel has tried 
to enforce in its relations with Syria. What Syria apparently 
wants is to have a treaty before the negotiations, and that has 
been a great obstacle because the word normal has been used but 
nobody knows exactly what normal means to the Syrians and what 
normal means to the Israelis. And I wonder, because--as I 
understand what you have said--Syria is a part of comprehensive 
peace for the region, and I'd like very much for you to comment 
on Syria's positions with regard to any future peace treaty with 
Israel. 
  [Husayn] I can't speak for the Syrians, nor would I presume 
to do so. But I am in constant touch with them, and I believe 
that the recent statements that we have heard are a reflection 
of what I know personally and they have gone far more than has 
ever been the case there in the past, in terms of clarity and in 
terms of a real determination, to also seek the goal that all of 
us are seeking. So I hope [words indistinct] that the coming 
phase will see some real progress regarding the Syrian-Israeli 
dimension, regarding the Lebanese-Israeli dimension, and 
certainly as far as we are concerned, I think we are just about 
to start once again. Today in fact? [laughter] 
  [Unidentified speaker] May I, Sir, first of all thank you 
for 
this opportunity to speak with you, for your candor, and may we 
all be present with you when you have achieved the crowning 
achievement, as you have described it, ratifying the peace 
treaty, and may it be soon. 
  [Husayn] That is our hope, God willing, Sir. [applause]

  [Text] Iraq has agreed to supply Jordan with all its needs 
of crude oil and refined products in 1994. Minister of Energy 
and Mineral Resources Walid 'Asfur also said on his return to 
Amman after talks in Iraq that he also discussed with Iraqi 
officials the prospect of setting up a pipeline between Jordan 
and Iraq after the lifting of UN sanctions against Iraq. 
  Mr. 'Asfur said he also discussed the possibility of setting 
up an oil refinery in the Port of al-'Aqabah after conducting a 
feasibility study on the project. Iraqi oil exports to Jordan 
are exempt from UN trade sanctions. During the visit, Mr. 
'Asfur also discussed with the Iraqis other aspects of oil 
industry cooperation, including drilling and exploration.

  [Text] Amman--Jordan and Iraq have agreed to study 
possibilities of building an oil pipeline to link Iraq with the 
port of al-'Aqabah after International sanctions on Iraq are 
lifted, an official statement said Tuesday [25 January]. 
  The statement, issued by Minister of Energy and Mineral 
Resources Walid 'Asfur to the JORDAN NEWS AGENCY, PETRA, said 
the agreement to conduct a feasibility study for the project was 
part of an accord Mr. 'Asfur and his Iraqi counterpart Safa' 
Hadi Jawad signed in Baghdad earlier this week. 
  The statement did not give details of the project except 
that 
the agreement also include building a refinery at al-'Aqabah 
based on studies on Jordan's consumption beyond the year 2010. 
In the meantime, Iraqi supplied oil in excess of Jordanian 
consumption would be exported. 
  PETRA quoted Dr. 'Asfur as saying that the project aimed at 
securing Iraqi oil supplies in a "quicker and safer manner once 
the sanctions are lifted." 
  The findings of the feasibility study will be submitted to 
the government of the two countries for approval, he said. 
  During his visit to Baghdad, Dr. 'Asfur also held talks with 
other senior Iraqi officials and attended a meeting with the 
energy ministers of Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Turkey on linking the 
power grids of the five countries in a regional network. 
  The agreement signed in Baghdad by Dr. 'Asfur and Mr. Jawad 
also renewed an arrangement under which Jordan will buy four 
million tonnes of crude and fuel oil from Iraq during the year 
1994. 
  This would roughly mean a daily supply of 50,000 barrels of 
crude oil and 25,000 barrels of fuel oil--Jordan's full needs of 
imported energy. 
  According to industry sources, part of the oil will be 
supplied free of cost and the rest at market prices. 
  The Iraqi oil supply to Jordan is exempt from the sweeping 
international sanctions imposed against Iraq following its 
August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. 
  Dr. 'Asfur also discussed with the Iraqi officials 
possibilities of exchange of expertise in oil and mineral 
exploration in cooperation with Jordan's natural resources 
authority and conducting studies on the al-Rishah gas fields 
near the Jordanian-Iraqi border. 
  The al-'Aqabah pipeline project appears to be a dusted-off 
version of a plan Jordan and Iraq abandoned in the mid-80s after 
Israel refused to provide an international undertaking not to 
attack the installations. 
  The Israel refusal, which was demanded by both Jordan and 
Iraq, [as published] prompted the U.S. Eximbank to refuse a $550 
million loan for the project, which at that time was estimated 
to cost $1 billion. 
  The project was considered at the height of Iraqi oil 
exports 
through al-'Aqabah when part of the Iraqi oil exporting 
facilities were crippled during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. 
  It envisaged laying a 1,000-kilometre long pipeline of 75- 
centimetre diameter from the H-3 pumping station in Iraqi 
territory near the border and down south through the desert to 
al-'Aqabah. 
  The H-3 station was part of a pre-1948 pipeline that pumped 
Iraqi oil across Jordan to the Mediterranean port of Haifa in 
British Palestine. 
  According to industry sources, the Iraqi part of the 
pipeline 
remains largely intact. Parts of the line in Jordanian 
territory near al-Mafraq have been destroyed. 
  Another project under consideration in the late 80s was 
taping an Iraqi pipeline with the Saudi oil port of Yanbu at 
midway and building a link with al-'Aqabah. This project 
envisaged the linkage in Saudi territory near the border with 
Jordan in the south and would have substantially reduced the 
cost when compared with the earlier proposal. 
  Officials said the project, which at one point appeared to 
have been all but finalised, was no longer under consideration.

<F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Transport Minister Adib Halasah headed for 
Baghdad Monday for high-level talks with Iraqi officials on 
issues related to the flow of Iraq-bound cargo through Jordan 
and the operations of a joint transport company. 
  Mr. Halasah and his Iraqi counterpart Ahmad Murtada would 
cochair the annual board meeting of the Iraqi-Jordanian Land 
Transport Company (IJTLC) and review the company's 1993 
operations and draw up plans for the next year. 
  The meeting will also finalise the 1993 report and annual 
accounts of the company, owned by the Jordanian and Iraqi 
governments, officials said. No details of the company's 
financial status were immediately available. 
  However, the officials said, the company's operations have 
been adversely affected by the continuing international 
sanctions against Iraq. Before the sanctions were imposed in 
August 1990, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the company 
largely depended on transporting Iraq-bound cargo unloaded at 
al-'Aqabah to Iraq. 
  The company continued to survive after the imposition of the 
sanctions on Iraqi imports of food and medicine exempt from the 
sanctions, but the overall volume of such cargo has decreased 
gradually, with Iraqi government agencies as well as private 
sector merchants turning to Iranian, Lebanese and Turkish ports 
for their imports to avert the costly delays incurred while 
importing through al-'Aqabah. 
  The delays and higher freight charges are caused as a result 
of what importers describe as overzealous enforcement of the 
sanctions by inspectors aboard warships patrolling the Red Sea. 
  During his talks in Baghdad, Mr. Halasah, who is accompanied 
by the Jordanian board members of the IJLTC and senior company 
officials, is also expected to raise Jordan's concerns over 
further decline of Iraqi imports through al-'Aqabah following 
the reopening of Iraq's Gulf port of Umm Qasr in November, the 
officials said. 
  While on a visit to Amman in late November, a senior Iraqi 
transport ministry official was reported to have assured Jordan 
that there was "a political decision" not to let the reopening 
of Umm Qasr affect Iraq's imports through al-'Aqabah. 
  But a campaign launched in Baghdad to encourage private 
sector importers to use Umm Qasr through incentives such as free 
fuel and bunkering, and guidelines given to shippers to use 
small-size vessels suitable to the Gulf port's capabilities have 
fuelled Jordanian concrns. 
  In one case, the Australian Wheat Board was requested to use 
two 25,000-tonne ships to carry 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Iraq 
instead of one 50,000-tonne vessel. Umm Qasr can only handle 
vessels up to a 25,000-tonne capacity. 
  Jordanian shipping agents however, expect a minimum level of 
Iraq-bound cargo to pass through al-'Aqabah. 
  "Umm Qasr is suitable for Iraqi imports from the Far East," 
said a shipping agent. "But volume of Iraqi purchase from the 
Far East is not much anyway. The bulk of Iraqi imports is from 
Europe, and this has to come through al-'Aqabah." 
  Furthermore, said the agent, many shipowners are reluctant 
to 
send their vessels to Umm Qasr because most international 
insurance companies either refuse to extend coverage to the 
vessel or demand high premiums. 
  Umm Qasr lies in an area where the threat of mines planted 
during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war as well as the war over Kuwait 
remains high. 
  The Jordanian Shipping Agents Association (JSAA) has called 
on the government to cooperate with the shipping sector to 
devise a package of incentives to attract shipping lines to use 
al-'Aqabah.

  [Text] The visit by the U.S. commerce secretary to Jordan 
has raised many questions among the Jordanian public on the 
purpose and nature of the visit at this critical phase, 
especially since the U.S. secretary made visits to Jordanian 
factories in a move interpreted by observers as direct 
intervention in Jordanian industries, particularly 
pharmaceuticals. 
  Other sources stressed that the visit was directly linked to 
the peace process and the writing off or reducing the Jordanian 
debts, which was the most important issue on the agenda of last 
week's summit between Husayn and Clinton. 
  While press sources stressed that the visit by the U.S. 
commerce secretary resulted in a government promise to end the 
Jordanian boycott of Israel, acting Prime Minister Dr. Ma'n 
Abu-Nuwar stressed to AL-BILAD that ending the boycott was not 
at all raised by the Jordanian or U.S. parties in the recent 
talks in Amman. He also said the reports published on this 
issue are totally unfounded, especially since the Americans know 
full well the true Jordanian firm stand on this issue -- that 
there should be a joint Arab position on the boycott. 
  In another development, the visit by a group of 83-rabbis, 
who toured Jordan from Amman to Petra, has drawn various 
reactions. Most people voiced concern that the normalization 
period has started already before any genuine guarantees to 
return the occupied Jordanian territories have been obtained and 
away from the comprehensive solution emphasized by the Jordanian 
Government. This was denied by Minister Abu-Nuwar, who stressed 
to AL-BILAD that this delegation was a tourist group, just like 
any other tourist group that visits Jordan. He said the 
competent authorities dealt with the delegation in that 
capacity, especially since members of the group were carrying 
U.S. passports that did not show any link to Israel or contain 
stamps to indicate that they had previously visited Israel. 
  Regarding the official receptions accorded to this 
delegation, Minister Abu-Nuwar stressed that they were not 
received by any official. 
  Away from Abu-Nuwar's statements, various Jordanian parties 
and public figures issued strong statements warning the 
government against falling into the trap of normalization with 
Israel and calling for confronting that normalization, which was 
started by the government and which means full submission to the 
Jewish state.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Amin] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Central Bank of Jordan [CBJ] has decided to 
give initial licenses to certain banks to reopen their branches 
in the towns of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, which have been 
closed since 1967. The move follows the Cabinet's approval of 
the move and the signing of the Jordanian-Palestinian economic 
accord, which regulates the financial and economic ties between 
the two parties. 
  CBJ Governor Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-Nabulsi yesterday told 
AL-DUSTUR that the CBJ has given initial licenses to five 
Jordanian banks to reopen branches in the occupied Palestinian 
towns as follows: 
The Arab Bank: Two branches, one in Nabulus, one in Gaza. 
  The Jordan Bank: One branch in Janin. 
  Jordan and Gulf Bank: One branch in Nabulus. 
  Jordan National Bank: One branch in Nabulus. 
  Arab Land Bank: Two branches, one in Bethlehem, one in 
Gaza. 
  Dr. al-Nabulsi noted that these licenses are initial, and 
the 
banks that are allowed to open branches must complete all 
measures and file all the necessary documents. 
  AL-DUSTUR learned that these branches will start their work 
after gaining the approval of the Israeli monetary authorities 
in accordance with the agreement reached through the 
Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli economic committee meetings in 
Washington. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Out of the government's concern for the citizen's 
health and safety and the security of his food and medicine 
supply, the Council of Ministers, which held a session under 
acting Prime Minister Dr. Ma'n Abu-Nuwar, devoted a considerable 
part of its morning session to discussing the food and medicine 
issue in detail. It heard two detailed reports by the supply and 
health ministers. 
  In light of this and in reply to a question posed by the 
JORDAN NEWS AGENCY on this issue, the acting prime minister said 
that the government, since it was formed, has been working to 
serve the citizen and to provide him with the best health, food, 
and environmental conditions. He added: The food and medicine 
control process has always been continuous and active. However, 
there are some gaps and complications, and some times there are 
conflicts between powers that encouraged certain people to 
exploit this control process. 
  Some time ago, the Health Ministry began work to achieve the 
highest degree of health and preventive guarantees. The health 
minister's remarks fall within this framework. 
  Dr. Abu-Nuwar added: Redressing the health and medicine 
situation and checking for negligence and attempts to tamper 
with this situation is a basic issue. The government will 
accept no violation or negligence in this regard. The 
government will not excuse anyone and will take every possible 
measure to deter violators. To guarantee this, the Council of 
Ministers has decided to form two ministerial committees. The 
first committee will discuss food affairs and is chaired by the 
supply minister. Specialized experts will be included as members 
of this committee, whose task is to discuss the food issue, 
including importing, transporting, storing, distributing, and 
pricing foodstuffs. The second committee will discuss medicine 
affairs and is chaired by the health minister. It will discuss 
the medicine issue, including its fitness for human consumption, 
as well as importing, controlling, and pricing medicines. The 
two ministerial committees will submit their report to the 
Council of Ministers as soon as possible. 
  The acting prime minister stressed that Jordan is a country 
that attaches great importance to safeguarding the citizen's 
health and preventing all exports that do not meet Jordanian and 
international food and medicine standards and specifications. 
  The acting prime minister said: The government appreciates 
the concern of the majority of our honest merchants for the 
interests of the citizen and the homeland, as well as that of 
the majority of workers in the health field. However, it will 
never tolerate any violation, exploitation, or any attempt to 
tamper with the citizen's health, food, and medicine security, 
which is happening among a very limited segment of workers in 
this important field. 
  The government has already begun work on a host of legal and 
administrative measures to meet and achieve these important 
objectives in order to upgrade the level of health control on 
food and medicine in the service of the citizen and the homeland.

<F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Ayman al-Safadi] </F>
  [Text] Amman--Spokesmen and presidents of parliamentary 
blocs and committees today hold a "crucial meeting" to study 
allegations by Minister of Health 'Abd-al-Rahim Malhas that a 
good quantity of food and medicine sold in the country do not 
meet standards and specifications. 
  Acting Speaker of the Lower House of Parliament 'Abd 
al-Razzaq al-Tubayshat called the meeting after some deputies 
demanded that the House hold an emergency session to discuss the 
minister's statements that first appeared in a weekly tabloid 
Thursday [20 January]. 
  About 30 other deputies demanded that the House hold a 
general discussion of the government's regulations on the entry 
of food and medicine to the market. 
  Dr. al-Tubayshat told the JORDAN TIMES Sunday that the 
meeting would agree on the steps that the House would take to 
investigate the minister's allegations and whether an 
extraordinary session will be held. He said the issue would be 
on the agenda of the house when it meets Wednesday. 
  Parliamentary sources said the House was divided on whether 
a 
parliamentary investigation committee should be set up to look 
into the minister's statements that appeared in a lengthy 
interview in SHIHAN Arabic-language weekly. 
  The sources said that some deputies wanted to hear the 
government's response to the minister's statements before a 
course of action is decided, with some arguing that the issue 
should be handled by the judiciary. 
  "The issues addressed by the minister, if proven true, means 
that the health of people is in grave danger. They point to 
real financial, administrative and political corruption that 
require the government to take immediate, firm and fundamental 
measures. They also require that the representatives of the 
nation support the minister," said 30 deputies in a request to 
hold a special session to discuss the minister's allegations. 
  Dr. Malhas told the JORDAN TIMES Friday that there was a 
deficiency in laws governing the sale of food and medicine in 
the market, pointing to the need of laws that would protect 
consumers. 
  He charged that a "mafia" of food and drugs merchants were 
violating the few existing laws that regulate the distribution 
of food and medicine. He said these merchants were resisting 
the new regulations the Ministry of Health has introduced to 
ensure that food and drugs sold in the market meet certain 
standards and specifications. 
  SHIHAN quoted Dr. Malhas as saying that a good quantity of 
food and medicine that reach the market "is the garbage of the 
industrialised world and is unfit (for human consumption)." 
  But Dr. Malhas told the JORDAN TIMES Friday that the weekly 
"blew (his remarks) out of proporition." He said SHIHAN 
"sensationalised" his statements. 
  President of Pharmacists Union Husam al-Din Mismar Sunday 
denounced the Minister's allegations and urged the government 
and the House to investigate remarks he made "against 
pharmacists." 
  In a front-page newspaper advertisement, Mr. Mismar sought 
to 
assure people about the safety and efficiency of drugs sold in 
the country. 
  Mr. Mismar, a former director at the pharmacy and medicine 
control directorate at the Ministry of Health, said the 
directorate examines and registers all drugs before they go into 
the market. 
  Dr. Malhas told the JORDAN TIMES that some of the ministry 
officials who are supposed to inspect drugs are pharmacists who 
own private pharmacies, pointing to a conflict of interest. 
  Former Minister of Health and serving Deputy Muhammad 'Addub 
al-Zabn said that all drugs that go to the market were examined 
by specialised committees at the Ministry of Health. 
  "The Ministry of Health is a scientific institution and it 
can never allow the importation of medicines unless they meet 
certain specifications," said Dr. al-Zabn. 
  Dr. al-Zabn said Dr. Malhas should have asked Parliament or 
the government to initiate laws if he saw a need for such laws. 
  The pharmacy and drug control directorate was established in 
the early 1980s by the then minister of health, Dr. Zuhayr 
Malhas. 
  Conflict between the ministry and the phamacists' union goes 
back to 1987 when Zayd Hamzah, then minister of health, insisted 
that pharmacies be attended by registered pharmacists. 
  Dr. Hamzah also banned the sale of medicine without 
prescriptions, except for "over the counter" drugs. 
  Informed sources said the ban was introduced to limit the 
sales of addictive drugs. 
  In his interview with SHIHAN, Dr. Malhas said that "pressure 
was applied," to overrule a Higher Court of Justice verdict that 
said pharmacies should be run by pharmacists in whose names they 
are registered. 
  The council for the interpretation of laws has overruled the 
court's verdict on the basis of a 1975 ruling that says 
pharmacists should not be in charge of their own pharmacies. 
  Dr. al-Zabn said that food shipments were also examined by 
specialised committees before being allowed into the country. 
  Other sources familiar with the situation, however, said 
that 
the inspection of food was the responsibility of various 
government ministries and departments and that that allows for 
confustion and inefficiency. 
  One source said that there were previous attempts to have 
one 
agency responsible for the examination of food "but 
unfortunately there was a power struggle (among the various 
bodies) and the effort never succeeded." 
  Sources pointed to the controversy over cooking fat 
shipments 
that did not meet specifications but were sold in the market in 
1989 as evidence of the inefficiency of some of the departments 
entrusted with inspecting food sold in the Kingdom. 
  "Only a thorough investigation can end the controversy 
created by the minister's statement," said a source familiar 
with the issue on the condition of anonymity. 
  "What the minister said is dangerous," he said. "it has to 
be 
investigated." 
  "Parliament is taking the matter very seriously. It will 
take the proper action on it," said Dr al-Tubayshat.

  [Text] Amman (Petra)--His Royal Highness Crown Prince 
Hasan, the Regent, Wednesday called for the establishment of a 
religious institute whose main task would be the promotion of 
inter-faith dialogue in the Middle East, since this region is 
the source of monotheistic religions. 
  In the concluding session of the 11th Islamic Christian 
dialogue which was organised by the Royal Academy for Islamic 
Civilisation Research in cooperation with the Vatican council on 
promoting relations with other faiths, Prince Hasan said such an 
insitute would contribute to crystallising thoughts and ideas 
promoting the cause of peace in the region. 
  Conveying to the participants in the dialogue the greetings 
of His Majesty King Husayn, Prince Hasan stressed the need to 
expand the participation of youth in inter-faith dialogue and to 
make such meetings include the participation of all segments of 
society other than the elite only. He said that he believes 
university and college curricula should include ideas and 
concepts affirming the importance of inter-faith dialogue. 
  Statements issued by the Vatican condemning the occupier and 
aggressor at any time and in any place had contributed to 
shedding light on the tragedies of many people, including the 
Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Prince said. 
  The Crown Prince proposed making the Mediterranean Sea 
linking the Arab World and Europe instead of being a sea 
splitting the two. 
  "Some people are ignorant about the essence of the Islamic 
message and accuse it of extremism at a time when 80 per cent of 
the world's refugees and displaced persons are Muslims," Prince 
Hasan said. 
  Cardinal Francis Arinze, president of the Vatican council on 
promoting relations with other faiths, also addressed the 
gathering held at the Royal Court, saying the two-day conference 
signified the depth of understanding between the followers of 
Islam and Christianity, who represent more than half of the 
world's population. 
  "We should all work for the good of humanity to create a 
better world and make a brighter future for all people," 
Cardinal Arinze said. "Providence had brought us here and 
facilitated the holding of this dialogue at the present time in 
history to work together seriously to achieve this goal through 
the exploitation of all available means, including the media, 
which as we have seen in the past, had the greatest influence in 
making it easier for us to achieve our goals." 
  The cardinal voiced hope that this meeting will be an 
incentive for the participants to be more prepared for the next 
meeting which will be held in 1995 in Rome under the motto: 
"Religion and the Environment." 
  The Vatican official voiced admiration of the special 
relationship between Muslims and Christians in Jordan and 
commended the Islamic-Christian joint culture which represents 
the accumulation of centuries-old relationships distinguished 
for justice and peace. 
  The cardinal presented Prince Hasan with the Arabic 
translation of old scrolls as a token gift.

<F P=106> [Address to nation by President Shankar Dayal Sharma; place </F>
and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] Fellow citizens, sisters, brothers, and dear 
children of India! Tomorrow our nation celebrates Republic Day. 
On this auspicious occasion, I have great pleasure in extending 
to you my warmest greetings and felicitations. Our Republic Day 
is a day of national resolve, a time to contemplate our position 
as a nation in relation to the world around us and to introspect 
upon our duties as individual citizens in enhancing and 
safeguarding the gains of freedom. 
  As we enter the 45th year of our republic, each of us must 
realize and act upon the realization that increasingly the world 
of today will test our every sinew and faculty, virtue and 
ideals, every system and sector. More than ever before common 
sense and clean understanding of present realities enjoin that 
we must organize ourselves to stand on our own resources -- 
human, institutional, material and spiritual. Indeed, we shall 
have to strive ever harder unitedly and with self-reliance to go 
from strength to strength, howsoever difficult the task may be. 
  For three centuries past, the history of the world has been 
determined by the relations between a few nations, even though 
they were involved in varying groups and in different periods in 
confrontation and war with one another. The waging of a valiant 
and principled struggle for equity and human dignity as in our 
country and other parts of the world was a crucially important 
trend in this context. In the present times and the future, the 
main features of the world's political economy will be molded by 
those nations which lead in science, technology and 
industrialization and occupy the commanding heights in global 
trade and commerce. 
  Today the world is at relative peace, threat of 
confrontation 
having been dramatically lessened and instead the scope for 
friendship and mutual collaboration having been enlarged. The 
leading nations are well-poised to cooperate in fashioning the 
emerging world order. Powerful and far-reaching initiatives in 
this direction are under way. A new global balance is being 
adjusted as between the continents of America, Europe, Africa, 
and Asia. A framework of guarded globalization including 
elaborate regulatory parameters is under settlement. New 
regional and zonal groupings are also assuming shape. 
Prestigious international organizations are facilitating 
peaceful establishment of the new environment for nations and 
peoples around the globe. 
  Friends! These developments impinge upon the lives of each 
of us as individuals and as citizens of one nation. Together, 
we must respond to the challenge and prove our mettle. Let us 
fully appreciate that within us we have the wherewithal to 
achieve positive dynamic transformation. Our nation has a 
tremendous wealth of talented and dedicated men and women 
comparable with and even superior to the best in the world. Our 
being wedded to democracy and having absorbed and gained fuller 
sensitivity to the concepts, processes and needs of democratic 
governance is an advantage of profound importance. We have 
built, gained experience in, and developed the institutional 
infrastructure and mechanisms of parliamentary democracy at the 
federal, state, district, taluka [revenue district] and village 
levels. We must impart greater qualitative and quantitative 
impetus to true democratic decentralization and augment 
political democracy with economic democracy. This would create 
the channels and scope for releasing and galvanizing the 
creativity and manifold genius of our vast human resources. 
Prudently husbanded, our remarkable range of biodiversity and 
mineral wealth, human talent, institutional structures and 
strategic location on the globe can spell rapid self-sustaining 
growth and development. 
  At the heart of this endeavor, we must uphold clearly and 
fully our great national values. The dignity of every human 
being, individual freedom, rights and duties, equality and 
social justice, service and selflessness and resolute commitment 
to materialize these must inform our tasks. Let us heed the 
voice of our sages and saints and learn the lessons from our own 
history. 
  Pluralism, oneness and equality are intrinsic elements of 
our 
heritage and comprise a source of national strengthen of 
enormous importance. For centuries, we have absorbed and 
reflected upon the truth of the oneness, of the inner doctrine 
and purpose of all religions. Let there now be full 
manifestation of this realization in our day-to-day actions in 
the social, political and economic areas of national life. 
  Friends! We Indians have to comprehend that the world is 
fast entering a new chapter in its history in which the modern 
imperatives of patriotic duty have to be analyzed, grasped and 
fulfilled by each citizen in his or her sphere of existence and 
service. The kisan, the jawan and the mazdur [peasant, soldier, 
laborers], our artisans and entrepreneurs, scientists, 
engineers, teachers and doctors, writers, poets and artists, 
representatives of the people, the judiciary, the civil service, 
and the armed forces, and especially the women of India, all of 
us must ponder over and perform with utmost devotion our 
respective individual and collective duty. 
  The father of our nation -- Mahatma Gandhi -- had said: I 
Quote: I want India to realize that she has a soul that can rise 
triumphantly above every physical combination of a whole world. 
Unquote. Our victory will be on the strength of our dedication 
to truth, nonviolence and unflinching constructive effort 
arousing the conscience of the world and the moral and ethical 
force of democracy in nations and peoples of the East and of the 
West. 
  India seeks peace, friendship, and cooperation with all 
nations and peoples, especially our neighbors in the 
subcontinent and other countries in Asia with whom we have ties 
of kinship and culture. We are committed to the wellbeing of 
all humanity and performing a creative role in world affairs. 
Equally, we shall zealously guard our freedom and national 
sovereignty and integrity. The government and the people of 
India shall brook no interference in this respect. 
  Friends! Let us strive to fulfill the dreams of those who 
gave their all for India's freedom and render service such that 
for generations hence our nation may regard us too as having 
done our duty well. Tomorrow, on our Republic Day when we 
unfurl the national tricolor, let us salute our flag of freedom 
and pledge ourselves to the glory of India and the good of all 
humankind. 
  Jai Hind [Hail India].

Atal Behari Vajpayee, has said that the government should 
demonstrate its clarity of purpose and foil the evil designs of 
Pakistan on Jammu and Kashmir. In a statement in New Delhi 
today, the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader said Mrs. 
Bhutto's call for a Pakistan bundh [strike] on the fifth of next 
month cannot cover Kashmir as it is an integral part of India.

"Tackling Kashmir Issue"] 
  [Text] All these years the Government of India took the 
position that the Kashmir issue had been settled legally and 
historically and that no dialogue was necessary on this score. 
But since 1984, particularly more recently, unimaginative and 
wooden nature of its Kashmir policy has led to a weakening of 
this position internationally. Pressures have mounted to such a 
degree that the matter could not be left in abeyance any longer. 
There has been an emergence of many new but important 
peripheral issues. By handling these badly it has strengthened 
Pakistan's position, so much so that Islamabad has been 
encouraged to ask the Human Rights Commission to send a 
fact-finding mission to Kashmir to investigate the violation of 
human rights by the Indian Army and the para-military forces in 
the valley. 
  Even when these peripheral issues are resolved and the wood 
cut to be able to see the trees, the main Kashmir issue will 
remain and will need to be tackled effectively. But the 
periphery must be addressed first: 
  (I) There has been a failure to start a political process in 
the State of Jammu and Kashmir, especially the valley, without 
the intervention of non-Kashmiri political parties in the 
valley, a failure to end President's rule and have an elected 
government. 
  (2) There has also been a failure to win over the voting and 
the non-voting population in the valley which is getting sick of 
the terrorist activity and would be willing to go back to the 
pre-1984 position of staying with India, provided that (a) fair 
and free elections are conducted; (b) a coalition government is 
not imposed on the people of Kashmir and (c) adequate economic 
and employment opportunities are provided to Kashmiris both 
within and outside the State. 
  (3) Owing to incursions by military and men from across the 
Line of Control into the valley, despite the presence of the 
army and the para-military forces at the border and elsewhere, 
there has been a failure to deal effectively with the terrorists 
and militants. There has at the same time been a failure to set 
up a Human Rights Commission early enough to demonstrate to the 
world that India does not condone atrocities by anybody. 
  (4) There has also been an unwillingness to allow various 
critics such as the human right groups, Congressmen and Members 
of Parliament from other countries to visit the valley and to 
see for themselves what is happening. 
  (5) When the population in the State of Jammu and Kashmir 
and 
specially in the valley became totally dissatisfied and the 
international community became a scathing critic on all the 
above counts, there has been a failure to start a dialogue with 
Pakistan and the various interested groups in Kashmir, giving 
the world a strong impression of adamance and total rigidity 
which aroused the international community further and enabled 
Pakistan to capitalise on this adamance of the Indian Government 
and unrest among the people. 
  As international community is getting seized of the Kashmir 
issue and agitations and pressures are mounting, India has had 
to concede a dialogue -- which incidentally has been provided 
for in the Simla Agreement as well as in the earlier U.N. 
resolution. Our Kashmir policy has always been halting and 
Pakistan has been taking full advantage of this. However, with 
some dynamic thinking and action it should be possible for the 
country to get rid of the peripheral problems, win over 
international opinion and deal with the main issue from a 
position of strength. 
  It would appear that some of the following measures would 
have to be taken in order to achieve a position of strength: 
  (a) The composition of the newly-established Human Rights 
Commission could be strengthened further, in order to avoid some 
criticisms, and the Commission could be asked to deal firmly and 
fairly with every case of human rights violation and atrocities. 
  (b) Human rights groups and other interested groups and 
individuals who wish to visit Kashmir should be allowed to go 
there freely and see things for themselves. The positive impact 
of having seen things for themselves and even adverse reports by 
these observers would be far more positive for India than the 
abominable suspicion generated by the clamour that India does 
not open the area for a fair observation as it has numerous 
things to hide from the world and is actually condoning the 
atrocities by its security forces and others. Such visits, if 
permitted freely, would bring out openly the killings, the rape 
cases and other atrocities committed by the terrorists and their 
allies too. If Pakistan has been sending men and arms in huge 
quantities across the border, visits to the valley by 
international observers and human rights groups can easily bring 
out this phenomenon and open the eyes of the world than any 
assertion by the Government that such incursions actually exist. 
There is no doubt that India has incontrovertible evidence of 
many such intrusions, and is said to have handed over evidence 
to Pakistan more than once. But anything that India can 
demonstrate regarding such intrusions can ever equal the 
effectiveness of the proof provided by international observers. 
  Once a strong Human Rights Commission functions in a fair 
manner and identifies and punishes the offenders, and once free 
access to the disturbed areas is available to the international 
institutions and groups, India should publicise these facts in 
world forum and get rid of the sharp criticism that it has had 
to face. This will improve the credibility of India's arguments 
which in themselves are good enough but are being demolished 
owing to the emergence of the secondary and peripheral factors. 
  (c) Pakistan has been asking for a dialogue on Kashmir but 
India has been refusing it. Now that under heavy pressure or 
whatever India has agreed to a dialogue, another irritant which 
bothered the international community has been removed. The 
dialogue should focus on the alternative ways of tackling the 
basic issue of Kashmir. India's position has all the 
possibilities of being substantiated and a solution around 
accepting the Line of Control will not be found to be the least 
acceptable among the various alternatives. 
  (d) By far the most important element in the settlement of 
the Kashmir issue would be the generation of new signals to the 
Kashmir population to the effect that the political process will 
soon be revived, that elections will be held, that a democratic 
set-up will be in place, at any rate in the valley, that the 
Kashmiris will be able to govern themselves as freely as the 
Maharashtrians and Tamil people without an external party 
breathing down their neck, and that adequate employment 
opportunities would be made available to them within as well as 
outside Kashmir.

  [Text] The Indian ambassador to the United States, Mr. 
Sidhartha Shanker Ray, has conveyed to the U.S. Administration 
New Delhi's concern over President Clinton's views on the human 
rights situation in Punjab. Mr. Ray met the U.S. assistant 
secretary for South Asian affairs, Mrs. Robin Raphel, in 
Washington yesterday and discussed in detail President Clinton's 
letter to a Democratic Congressman, Mr. Gary Condit. 
  The External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi had sharply 
reacted on Sunday [23 January] to the development which comes in 
the wake of the series of negative pronouncements by the U.S. 
authorities on issues like Kashmir, human rights, and Punjab. 
Meanwhile, a U.S. official in Washington has said that Mr. 
Clinton's letter did not contain anything anti-Indian or sought 
to encourage secessionist elements. According to the official 
Mr. Clinton had mentioned that the situation in Punjab has 
improved and that there have been regional elections leading to 
the restoration of the local government and the level of 
violence in the state also declined. 
  A United States delegation has appreciated the working of 
the 
National Human Rights Commission set up in the country recently. 
A 12-member delegation consisting of two associate justices of 
the United States Supreme Court, four U.S. circuit judges, and 
five lawyers visited the National Human Rights Commission in New 
Delhi today. The chairman of the commission, Mr. Justice 
Ranganath Mishra, informed the visiting dignitaries that the 
commission will soon publish its own regulations and make people 
aware of its working procedures. The delegation has 
specifically appreciated the commission for taking suo moto 
cognizance of human rights violations and for its steps to order 
independent inquiries into various cases. 
  The Punjab chief minister has criticized President Clinton 
for his comments. Talking to our Chandigarh correspondent, Mr. 
Beant Singh, said the U.S. President is ill-informed about 
Punjab. The Sikhs are fully enjoying democratic rights in the 
state. Reacting to the alleged violations of civil liberties, 
the chief minister said he himself and the majority of the 
elected legislators, sarpanchas [head of village council], and 
panchas [village council member] in villages are Sikhs and the 
state government is curbing militancy and not civil rights. Mr. 
Beant Singh invited the U.S. President to Punjab to see for 
himself the smooth running of democracy in the border state.

  [Text] Cairo, 25 Jan (MENA)-- Shaykh Fahim Bin-Sultan al- 
Qasimi, secretary general of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC], 
has affirmed that the Arab boycott of Israel will continue until 
the original causes for it have been removed and Israel has 
withdrawn from all the occupied Arab territories. He noted that 
the bilateral boycott [muqata'ah thuna'iyah] can be ended 
gradually if progress is made on the basis of goodwill 
initiatives. 
  At a press conference he held this afternoon on the 
sidelines 
of the second international conference on challenges facing the 
Arab world amid world changes, Shaykh al-Qasimi said that there 
is no fear of Israeli penetration of Gulf markets if a 
comprehensive peace is achieved. He remarked that the GCC 
states will not be a "piece of cake" for Israel. 
  On the GCC stand on Iran's occupation of Tunb al-Sughra, 
Tunb 
al- Kubra, and Abu-Musa--the three islands of the United Arab 
Emirates-- al-Qasimi pointed out that the GCC will refer the 
matter to international organizations if Iran and the Emirates 
do not resolve the dispute. 
  Asked about the varying stands the GCC states adopted on 
Iraq 
and Iran, al-Qasimi emphasized that the GCC summit resolutions 
on these matters are binding to all members. He pointed out 
that varying views do not mean that these states are divided. 
Each state is entitled to its own views and what counts is for 
all these views to serve the GCC's interests, he said. He added 
that any contact between a Gulf state and either Iran or Iraq is 
in the GCC states' interest because these contacts seek 
solutions to the problems involving these two states. 
  On the GCC stance on borders among Gulf states, Shaykh Fahim 
remarked that the GCC is not a unique case and that these 
matters are on their way to a solution. 
  Answering a question on increasing the number of the 
Peninsula Shield troops, al-Qasimi stated that the GCC has 
agreed to increase the troops from 8,000 to 17,000 and to 
develop united military and communication systems. 
  Shaykh al-Qasimi added that the Gulf states must develop a 
common vision of cooperation. He also said that the Damascus 
Declaration leaves defense cooperation between Gulf states and 
both Egypt and Syria up to each individual state. 
  Al-Qasimi answered a question on the visit the Omani energy 
minister paid to European and East Asian states to negotiate a 
reduction in oil output. He said the visit produced encouraging 
results and that he received a report from the Omani minister, 
affirming that the responses were very reassuring. He remarked 
that a reasonable reduction in the oil output will contribute to 
price stability.

  [Text] Kuwait, 26 Jan (KUNA) -- A Kuwaiti daily asked today 
how Yasir 'Arafat could forget the sins he committed against our 
kith and kin in Saudi Arabia when al-Dammam, Dahra, and Riyadh 
were being hit by the missiles of Iraqi sin while he placed his 
hand into the hand of his friend Saddam Husayn, and was the 
first person to believe that the path leading to the liberation 
of Jerusalem passes through Kuwait, then Saudi Arabia, and then 
the rest of the Gulf countries. The daily AL-ANBA' said in its 
leader today that "'Arafat is saying that he has placed the 
responsibility of the al- 'Aqsa Mosque on the custodian of the 
two holy mosques, as if King Fahd and his honorable people 
needed to be reminded by a vile person about this 
responsibility. The late King Faysal Bin-'Abd- al-'Aziz paid 
with his life for this responsibility and was assassinated, 
precisely because he had announced that he shouldered the 
responsibility for al-'Aqsa Mosque and that he was committed to 
it." AL-ANBA' asked: "Would be unjust to 'Arafat to remind him 
of the day when he knelt before his master Saddam, sang the 
praises of the occupying Iraqi Army, and said he wished that he 
had part of that occupying army in order to remain in Kuwait for 
60 days [as received]?" 
  PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat said in press statements 
following 
his arrival in Riyadh last Sunday that he placed the 
responsibility of the al-'Aqsa Mosque on the custodian of the 
two holy mosques.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in </F>
Jeddah by 'Abdallah Nasir al-Shahri in Riyadh "the day before 
yesterday evening"] 
  [Text] [Al-Shahri] Why did you arrive in Jeddah later 
than originally planned? 
  ['Arafat] I went to console my brother President Hafiz 
al-Asad after the martyrdom of his son, hero Basil al-Asad. I 
stopped over in Cairo on my way here. 
  [Al-Shahri] What will you say to the custodian of the Two 
Holy Mosques? 
  ['Arafat] I will say a lot of things. I will ask him to 
shoulder the responsibility for al-Aqsa Mosque, and I am certain 
he is capable of shouldering this responsibility. 
  [Al-Shahri] What will you say to the Saudi people? 
  ['Arafat] We will continue to move together until we pray in 
al-Aqsa Mosque. 
  [Al-Shahri] But you were not with this people during the 
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait? 
  ['Arafat] I hope that issue will be brought to a close. I 
said that we will pray together in al-Aqsa Mosque. 
  [Al-Shahri] Fine. You met with Peres in Oslo. Did your 
talks with him achieve any progress? 
  ['Arafat] There has been no progress. However, we agreed to 
continue the talks this week in order to bridge the gaps between 
us. 
  [Al-Shahri] Opposition to your policy continues to increase 
inside and outside the PLO. 
  ['Arafat] We are a democratic state, and every person is 
entitled to say whatever he likes. We respect others' views. 
  [Al-Shahri] Kuwaitis say that they have recently discovered 
weapons and skulls inside the Palestinian embassy. What is your 
opinion? 
  ['Arafat] Brother, it was a machine gun and a pistol 
belonging to the ambassador. They must not say that. 
  [Al-Shahri] What about the skulls? 
  ['Arafat] They must not say that. They are dummies made out 
of plaster for first aid training. 
  [Al-Shahri] What will you tell them if they insist these 
corpses exist? 
  ['Arafat] Let them prove it. 
  [Al-Shahri] Will your Gulf tour be limited to the Kingdom, 
or are you going to visit other states like Kuwait, for example? 
  ['Arafat] If I am invited, I will visit them. 
  [Al-Shahri] You did not tell me what you are going to say to 
the Saudi people? 
  ['Arafat] Respected brother, I answered your question. I 
said we will head for al-Aqsa Mosque together. By the way, why 
are you interrogating me? Good-bye.

<F P=106> [Report by Shafiq al-Asadi] </F>
  [Excerpts] Abu Dhabi--Diplomatic sources in Abu Dhabi [UAE] 
have reported that statements by Iranian Interior Minister 
Mohammad 'Ali Besharati reflect clear inconsistencies in his 
country's position on its dispute with the UAE over three 
strategic islands in the Gulf. Besharati described the dispute 
between Iran and the UAE over "some islands" as "simple" and to 
be solved "by dialogue." He added in a press conference in Doha 
yesterday, Saturday, that relations between Iran and the UAE are 
"good" and have always been good. 
  Observers think that Besharati's statements, in spite of the 
fact that they represent the moderate side of Tehran's position 
on the dispute over the islands, do not offer the truth about 
the details of the conflict between the UAE and Iran and are not 
a "suitable" position from which to arrive at a peaceful 
settlement through direct dialogue. 
  These observers pointed out that Besharati is talking about 
solving the dispute over "some islands" without naming them, and 
that it is known that he means the island of Abu Musa, which has 
been administrated by a memorandum of understanding between the 
two countries since 1971. The Iranian interior minister does not 
mean the Greater and Lesser Tunb Islands, which Iran occupied in 
1971. In spite of the fact that Besharati's position "is 
lacking" and does not offer any practical steps leading to a 
direct dialogue with the UAE on the matter of the three islands, 
in the opinion of Gulf political circles it is a more advanced 
position than that of the Iranian foreign [policy] position. 
[passage omitted on Iranian official statement] 
  Observers indicate that Besharati's statement about good 
relations with the UAE is a new element in the Iranian lexicon 
and will permit contacts to be made with some parties in the 
Iranian leadership in Tehran. It appears that the politicians in 
the UAE are well versed in the inconsistencies in Tehran, since 
the UAE's ambassador in Tehran, Muhammad Ahmad Bu-Rahimah, has 
met with the Iranian interior minister, who affirmed after the 
meeting that "the differences with the UAE are simple." However, 
political circles in Abu Dhabi do not see such a meeting as a 
dialogue with Tehran, because the Iranian position, with all its 
factions, is not considered suitable to conduct a direct 
dialogue to arrive at a peaceful solution to the islands issue. 
  UAE Foreign Minister Rashid 'Abdallah al-Nu'aymi states that 
any meetings with Iranian officials, among them his meeting with 
'Ali Akbar Velayati, the foreign minister, on the international 
and regional conference level, are "contacts" and not "a 
dialogue." The UAE conditions such a dialogue on Tehran's 
decision to deal with the three islands in it. [passage omitted 
on history of the dispute] 
  Political circles state that the position of Iran on the UAE 
islands issue will have a great impact in determining the 
Iranian role and cooperation with the other countries of the 
region in maintaining security and stability. The eight states 
that signed "the Damascus declaration" support the UAE's 
position on the islands issue and its settlement by peaceful 
means. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Reports by Hammud Munsir in Sanaa and Lutfi Shatarah in </F>
Aden: "Military Arrangements With Foreign Participation To 
Ensure Signing of `Pledge Document'"] 
  [Text] Yemeni opposition sources have stated that a number 
of officers from the armies of Jordan and Oman have arrived in 
Yemen to take part in coordinating the security arrangements for 
the official signing of the "Pledge Document" for resolving the 
Yemeni crisis, also with the participation of the U.S. and 
French military attaches in Sanaa to eliminate the risk of a 
military clash between the forces of the General People's 
Congress and the Yemeni Socialist Party, the two parties to the 
crisis. 
  Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum, leader of the Patriotic Forces Union 
and chairman of the National Dialogue subcommittee making 
arrangements for the signing of the "Pledge Document," has told 
AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the alleged controversy over the 
subcommittee was unfounded and that it did not receive 
instructions from any party. He said that work was proceeding 
toward completion of the arrangements, but opposition sources 
warned that the situation was moving toward confirmation of the 
existing undeclared secession or toward some kind of foreign 
trusteeship for the country. 
  Denying the opposition's claims, Shaykh Abu-Luhum said the 
arrangements committee is considering all possible options and 
is eager to reach agreement on a venue and date for the signing 
"on the basis of comprehensive national grounds, for it is 
structured to include the coalition parties, the opposition 
parties, and the independent patriotic forces." 
  He said that the document "belongs not to any particular 
parties or political forces but to the Yemeni people who have 
blessed and supported it because it covers public issues." 
  Meanwhile, sources close to Shaykh Muhammad Bin-Naji 
al-Ghadir, chairman of the Higher Council of the Yemeni tribes 
"Saba'" and chieftain of the Khawlan tribes, have confirmed that 
he was able to bring about the release of the helicopter 
belonging to the American company Hunt Oil, which operates in 
the governorate of Ma'rib, its pilot, and the Indian expert who 
was with him, after giving the Bani-Jabr tribe (of Khawlan) two 
Toyota vehicles. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the 
Presidential Council, has asserted that the accord document 
reached by the Political Forces Dialogue Committee is a document 
of national consensus. It also represents a new social contract 
to rectify the course of Yemeni unity and formulate new bases to 
build a modern Yemeni state in which security, justice, 
stability, and development prevail. 
  In a speech he delivered this morning to the commanders of 
military units, security agencies, and [words indistinct] in the 
commercial and economic capital, Aden, he said the accord 
document reflects the Yemeni people's strength and their 
possession of resources and capabilities that render serious, 
responsible dialogue a means of finding solutions to problems, 
away from violence and threats to use force. The accord 
document also confirms that the Yemeni people have chosen the 
path of democracy, peaceful, democratic action, and heeding the 
voice of reason to address the challenges and overcome the 
obstacles facing the process of unity and democracy. 
  The vice chairman of the Presidential Council stressed the 
importance of implementing the items contained in the accord 
document. He pointed out that the historic value of this 
document lies in the ability of the masses to translate it into 
concrete reality in all walks of life. 
  He added that this major national mission requires the 
efforts of all sincere national forces that seek to build a 
state with institutions where law and order prevail and 
democracy and development are achieved. 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice chairman of the Presidential 
Council, urged the commanders of military and security units to 
be the first to implement the accord document and to set a good 
example of how to run units, enhance the principle of 
discipline, and implement their assigned programs and plans 
tirelessly. He also urged them to improve the living conditions 
and boost the morale of the personnel of their institutions and 
[words indistinct] to enable them to perform their duties by 
defending the homeland and safeguarding its achievements. He 
further urged them to demonstrate a serious, sincere position 
toward the issues of the people and the homeland. 
  The meeting was attended by Defense Minister brother 
Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir and several military 
commanders.

  [Text] The military committee has continued its field 
visits to the southwestern axis by visiting the 25th Brigade 
[words indistinct] and meeting the commanders and troops. 
  During the meeting, brother Staff Lieutenant General [words 
indistinct] General Staff for operations and head of the 
committee, addressed the commanders and troops. At the outset, 
he conveyed the greetings of brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme 
commander of the Armed Forces, and 'Ali Salim al-Bid, vice 
chairman of the Presidential Council. He also reviewed the 
military committee's efforts and duty of inspecting the military 
situation. He said the drawbacks produced by the transitional 
phase with regard to the Armed Forces and its personnel should 
now end. He urged pooling all efforts to overcome all negative 
phenomena in all military aspects in light of the accord 
document which hopefully will remedy all ills. 
  He further urged the commanders and troops to assume their 
national responsibilities in the current decisive circumstances 
and to do whatever would restore trust and brotherly 
communication between troops as a condition for the cohesion of 
the ranks of the Yemeni Armed Forces. 
  During the meeting, the members of the military committee 
also spoke about the importance of Yemeni unity as a historical 
and national gain. They stressed that Yemeni unity is not up 
for bargaining. They said the current national issues in the 
Yemeni arena are national political issues and not differences 
between the two parts of Yemen. 
  They also emphasized that safeguarding Yemeni unity is the 
duty and goal of all honorable people in the Yemeni arena. They 
further stressed that responsibility for national security is a 
prime duty of the state of unity and its institutions. This 
duty is primarily the responsibility of the units and formations 
of the Yemeni Armed Forces, which should be redeployed on this 
basis so as to enable the homeland to have a unified identity. 
  Also during the meeting, the unit commanders welcomed the 
military committee, affirming that the commanders and troops are 
aware of their national responsibilities and the Armed Forces' 
duty to protect Yemen.

  Ali Alatas conveyed a message to the brother president from

  For his part, the chairman of the Presidential Council

special and historical relations based on Islamic brotherhood, a 
cultural dimension, and trade between the two countries. He 
also affirmed our country's eagerness to promote these ties to 
achieve the hopes of the two peoples. He noted that there are 
many opportunities to develop cooperation, especially in 
investment. In this regard, he said our country's investment 
law provides a good climate and gives guarantees and good 
opportunities for investors in all fields. 
  The brother president also asked the Indonesian foreign 
minister to convey his greetings to President Suharto and his

  [Text] The head of the U.S. CIA organization has explained 
that Washington is watching Tehran's policies intensively. In 
his report to the information committee [as heard] of the U.S. 
Senate, James Woolsey claims that the Islamic Republic of Iran's 
administration is seeking to consolidate its military base and 
describes Iran as the most crisis-generating spot for the United 
States in the coming years.

<F P=106> [Station commentary: "Bill Limiting America's Participation </F>
in Overseas Operations"] 
  [Excerpts] Any day now, the U.S. Congress will debate a new 
Republican bill about the method of America's participation in 
interventionist operations. The bill imposes restrictions on 
America's military presence on the international scene and also 
America's role in the UN. [passage omitted] 
  The imposition of such restrictions takes place when America 
is emerging from an era of defeats in her interventionist 
policies. The failure of America's hypocritical interference in 
Bosnia and the disgraceful departure of American soldiers from 
Somalia and Haiti forced that country's authorities to minimize 
such defeats by creating a legal mechanism. 
  Although the bill is presented to the congress by the leader 
of the Senate Republicans, far from being tantamount to 
opposition to the performance of the Democrats abroad, it is 
aimed at maintaining America's superiority and global domination 
-- a superiority and domination attained at less cost and lower 
casualties. For that reason the American statesmen intend to 
involve the Congress, in addition to the government and its 
representative, in decisionmaking at the United Nations on 
participation in overseas operations. Under the bill, the 
Congress should be involved and before the government votes for 
interventionist activities at the Security Council, it should 
consult members of Congress. 
  The Congress claims that it approved the bill on America's 
membership at the United Nations on the condition that it be a 
fully fledged partner in that organization's financial and 
military decisionmaking. That claim reveals the fact that, to 
preserve her status, America has always deferred any fundamental 
effort to the United Nations. For that reason, after the 
failure in various operations and the inability to finance them, 
she asks the United Nations to pay all the expenses relating to 
the provision of military forces, equipment, and transport 
operations. 
  According to the leader of the U.S. Senate Republicans, the 
joint U.S.-UN operations in Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti showed 
that it is not in America's interests to allow the United 
Nations to determine the country's foreign policy. In his view, 
the bill will not resolve all the existing differences between 
America and the United Nations but, through the participation of 
the congress in fundamental decisions, it will result in 
America's interests on foreign policy being safeguarded. 
  Here, one could say that giving credit to the United Nations 
would mean something only when it makes decisions in line with 
the policies of that country, and the decision of the Security 
Council to send forces would only be practical for America if 
the cost of the operation is incurred by that organization, with 
a minimum of U.S. soldiers lost.

<F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>
  [Text] As you know, the 12th session of talks between the 
governments involved in the Middle East crisis and Israel 
started yesterday afternoon. Following the signing of the 
'Arafat-Tel Aviv accord, these discussions faced a stalemate for 
four months. But after the meeting between the U.S. President 
and his Syrian counterpart in Geneva, a new round of talks has 
begun. The special characteristics of and the outlook for the 
new round of talks are discussed by Ne'matzadeh, an expert in 
the News Research and Commentaries Group. 
  [Begin Ne'matzadeh recording] In the name of God, the 
almighty and merciful. Good morning, dear compatriots. 
  This round of talks is largely on the level of the heads of 
the Arab delegations from Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine 
and Israel. The most important development compared with the 
previous 11 rounds is that this one is being held away from the 
propaganda atmosphere and the mass media, such that they have 
been described as completely confidential talks. 
  Even though the head of the Israeli delegation has said that 
the mass media and propaganda are being avoided because of the 
useless or harmful role played by propaganda in previous rounds, 
some political observers believe that this new tactic represents 
a middle line between Israel's insistence on completely 
confidential talks and Syria's insistence on open discussion. 
Perhaps the outcome of the discussions between the United 
States and Syria in Geneva on Sunday was to select this middle 
line: Open talks but far from the mass media and propaganda. 
  The other characteristic of this round is that no one has 
stated when the talks will end. The current round of talks in 
Washington is significant and sensitive, because of its links to 
last week's meeting between al-Asad and Clinton. The talks 
resuming after a long interruption was the most important 
outcome of the discussions between the United States and Syria. 
Thus, the failure of the current talks or, to be more fair, 
their becoming routine will only mean the defeat and failure of 
the United States in this phase. 
  The countries participating in the talks, particularly 
Israel 
and Syria, which are considered to be the major sides in this 
round -- while trying to preserve the optimistic propaganda 
atmosphere created by the Geneva meeting--cannot hide their 
concern over the behavior and motives of the other side and have 
started blaming the possible failure of the talks on the 
self-centered and expansionist policy of the other side. 
  Irrespective of Syria's efforts during the Geneva meeting 
and 
afterward to display its goodwill and support for a peaceful 
Middle East solution, Israel has not held back from reacting 
negatively to the al-Asad-Clinton meeting. Thus, the success of 
the current round of talks depends on the outcome of a 
tug-of-war involving Syria's fundamentalism, Israel's behavior, 
and U.S. pressure. 
  Of course, the futile pattern of 'Arafat's experience in his 
unending talks with Israel and his wasted dreams is no secret to 
the sides sitting at the negotiating table with Israel. The 
bombing of south Lebanon by Israel in tandem with the 
commencement of the 12th round of Washington talks shows that 
Israel insists on showing its aggressive nature to the 
negotiating sides that have entered the negotiations with the 
Zionist regime and that it is very hopeful of leaving the talks 
with its hands full, helped by Washington's support. [end
