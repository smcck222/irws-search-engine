  [Text] Minsk, 30 Dec -- Belarusian Prime Minister 
Vyacheslav Kebich said today that "interaction with Russia is 
the cornerstone of the republic's policy." 
  "We firmly believe that people need to follow our course 
toward an economic union within the CIS framework, a single 
ruble zone with Russia, and coordinated customs space as an 
opportunity and necessity to live and work in a civilized way," 
he said today at a reception for diplomats accredited in Minsk. 
  The premier said: The basis of our foreign policy is giving 
up force and a threat of force and giving up nuclear weapons. 
"We were the first among the former USSR republics and among the 
world's states in general, who, without putting forward any 
preliminary conditions to the world community, began nuclear 
disarmament. By doing this, we laid our own little brick in the 
common foundation for European and international security. At 
the same time, we are not expecting any gratitude from the world 
community. The main thing for us is trust, mutual 
understanding, and an opportunity for full-blooded international 
cooperation," he said.

Shushkevich--recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed citizens of the Commonwealth of 
Independent States! My passionate desire is that under no 
circumstances do we ever discard the better things we had in the 
past. It seems to me that we have all the preconditions to use 
them, to regenerate and strengthen them on a new and fundamental 
basis. We are able to cooperate in a worthy fashion; each 
nation can take care of itself. But it would be senseless in 
some ways if there were no cooperation. I would say this: The 
great community we had before must not be lost under any 
circumstances. A worthy, legal basis of cooperation must be 
created, and this is being done within the framework of the CIS. 
The Commonwealth must be established as conceived at Viskuli 
[the Viskuli agreement which was reached at Belovezhskaya 
Pushcha and named after the government residence in Brest oblast 
where talks took place] as cooperation of the cultures, the 
peoples, and the economies. One must say that our mutual 
relations must not be guided by rulers or ideological dogma. We 
must join together in that popular upsurge of friendship which 
always existed. 
  On behalf of the Republic of Belarus, the leadership of the 
Republic of Belarus, and the people of the Republic of Belarus, 
I would like to wish you a happy New Year, would like 1993 to be 
the last difficult year of reform for you, and hope that in 1994 
we achieve what we are striving for, that each person can be 
master of his own fate. We are not alone in the process of 
transforming totalitarian structures into democratic ones, and 
if China and the Baltic countries can manage a good showing in 
the development of industry and the economy, I would like this 
to be achieved by all CIS countries. We have sufficient 
intellectual potential and enough patience for this, and I am 
convinced that 1994 will bring us new successes. I wish you a 
happy New Year, a happy 1994 and the years after it! I wish you 
happiness and joy and all the best that life offers!

  [Text] President of the Republic of Moldova Mircea Snegur 
today granted an interview to our radio station. Referring to 
the main events next year in Moldova -- the 27 February 
elections and the adoption of the new constitution -- Mr. Mircea 
Snegur said that the two events mark new steps toward the 
democratization of society. 
  The important problems that have to be solved next year 
include the improvement of the image of the Republic of Moldova 
in the world and of the domestic political situation, especially 
the situation in the eastern and southern rayons of Molodva, and 
the speeding up of the economic reform process. 
  In connection with the sentence pronounced in the trial of 
the Ilascu group, President Snegur recalled that, from the very 
beginning, the Presidency had done all that it could to have the 
detainees transferred to the appropriate constitutional bodies 
in Moldova; he said that he was optimistic about the case's 
outcome. 
  Mr. Snegur also emphasized the need to re-establish the 
four-way mechanism to seek a peaceful solution to the situation 
in the Dniester region. 
  As for the year to come, President Mircea Snegur expressed 
the hope that the obstacles that have emerged so far in 
relations between Romania and the Republic of Moldova will be 
overcome more successfully. He also expressed the hope that 
these relations will continue to develop.

<F P=106> [New Year's address by President Mirca Snegur "to Mayak </F>
listeners" -- recorded] 
  [Text] The Republic of Moldova ends 1993 on an optimistic 
note. We have had a peaceful year. We have gathered a good food 
harvest. We have moved forward along the path of economic 
reforms. It is sufficient to say that privatization has begun. 
A national currency -- the Moldovan lei -- has been introduced. 
I think that these are good grounds for optimism and a good 
starting point for the new year, 1994, on which we are placing 
great hopes. Especially because recently the meeting of heads 
of CIS states agreed on new ways toward economic integration and 
the creation of conditions for the normal functioning of the 
national economies. 
  On behalf of the people of Moldova, I congratulate all the 
people of the world from my heart on the new year of 1994. I 
wish you all strong health, great happiness, peace, and 
prosperity. 
  Happy New Year.

  [Text] In his New Year's message, President Mircea Snegur 
emphasized that a political shortfall is the reason for the 
tense situation in the eastern rayons of the republic. He 
denounced the separatist ambitions of the leaders in Tiraspol 
and reaffirmed his determination to ensure the territorial 
integrity of the state. We will not tolerate blackmail, 
pressure, and interference from outside, President Snegur also 
said. 
  Recalling the dependence on suppliers of material resources, 
especially energy resources, and the acute problem of markets 
for the sale of products, Mircea Snegur affirmed that these 
factors have raised, first and foremost, the need for adherence 
to the CIS economic union. He added, however: Our position is 
a single one, namely that Moldova will participate solely in the 
activity of the economic structures of the CIS. I have also 
reaffirmed this position at the recent meeting in Ashgabat. 
  President Snegur also talked about the elimination of the 
consequences of totalitarianism, the democratization of the 
entire public activity, the promotion of political and economic 
reforms, and about the transition to a market economy.

  [Text] According to President Mircea Snegur, 1993 has been 
not easy for Moldova. 
  Receiving members of the diplomatic corps, accredited to 
Moldova, in Chisinau on Thursday night for a New Year he 
mentioned among the country's main problems the unresolved 
issues on Transdniestria and Gagauzia (southern Moldova), the 
shortage of goods, growing prices, and falling population 
incomes. 
  However, these setbacks, in his opinion, are compensated by 
obvious rewards, including the passage of democratic laws, the 
introduction of a national currency, and the population's 
growing confidence in irreversible reforms.

  [Text] I wish to use this opportunity provided by Ostankino 
to address all the residents of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States, all its citizens. I want to wish you all a happy New 
Year. I would also like to say this to you: My dear 
compatriots! No, its not a slip of the tongue. Indeed, we all 
come from a common fatherland. Even though today we are 
separated by the borders of independent states, we have been 
brought up on the same land. A land bathed in our forefathers' 
sweat and blood. They worked on this land, on this field. They 
raised children, they believed in a better future. Special 
relations, special ties were established between the peoples of 
the former Soviet Union, binding together the hearts of all the 
people, and it was this that helped our fathers, our peoples, 
leaders of our states, to find the best solutions for the sake 
of the common people. 
  Times are not easy for us now, but I am convinced that we 
will find ways toward prosperity; we cannot fail to find them. 
I believe in the wisdom of all the peoples of the former Soviet 
Union; therefore I believe we will find them. 
  Now I want to address you all with just one thing. I want to 
wish that we all retain the friendly ties we had and still have; 
to retain them in the year 1994, to retain them in order to 
quench the fire of fratricidal war in the former Soviet Union so 
that 1994 becomes a year of mutual trust, a year of 
rapprochement, not one of divergence. We have nothing to 
quarrel about. I favor moving toward prosperity through 
unification, through mutual help, through setting up a common 
market space. 
  Happy New Year, dear compatriots.

and date not given; from the "Mir" broadcast -- recorded] 
  [Text] Despite the fact that people are experiencing the 
hardships of the transitional period, as we call it, and that 
these hardships still exist, well, as the saying goes, hope is 
always the last thing to die. So I would like all Commonwealth 
states to look to the future with optimism. Why? Because the 
people who belong to the former Soviet Union have experienced 
many hardships. 
  I should very much like 1994 to be, for all the peoples, a 
year of insight, the year of the realization that only unity, 
only the preservation of the friendship that did nevertheless, 
exist in the former Soviet Union between the peoples, and [the 
preservation] of the wisdom that has always existed in our 
peoples -- that is what will lead to prosperity. 
  Be that as it may, life moves on. Whatever happens, we are 
doing everything to improve people's lives in the future. So I 
urge wisdom, prudence, calm, respect by every person for the 
person next to him, respect by people for one another, and 
respect by states for one another. 
  Today ultimata have to be removed from the vocabulary. Today 
one must speak with the language of understanding, the language 
of cooperation, and the language of mutually beneficial trade. 
  I wish everyone happiness and health. I hope that in every 
family there is prosperity, and that 1994 brings every family at 
least some small joy.

  [Text] President Nursultan Nazarbayev addressed the peoples 
of Kazakhstan with a New Year's message. He said: Despite the 
difficulties of the present period we managed to preserve our 
republic' main asset -- public and political stability, civil 
and interethnic accord. This is the cornerstone on the basis of 
which we succeeded in avoiding economic and political upheavals 
and we can confidently face the future. Maintaining such an 
atmosphere is most valuable and we can be proud of this. It 
could facilitate the process of reforms in our society. 
  I am grateful to you, my compatriots and like-minded people, 
for your support. By the powers, that have been given to me by 
the Constitution and you, I guarantee observation of the 
principle of equality and liberties of all people, irrespective 
of nationality, religion, and social status. Kazakhstanis 
should not worry about their future and the future of their 
children. All of us have a common motherland, the Republic of 
Kazakhstan, and we should think about its prosperity. The 
current year should become one of the more important stages on 
this path. I wish optimism, wisdom, and strength to each 
Kazakhstani and each family so as to undergo all the trials with 
credit. Happy New Year, my dear compatriots.

  [Excerpts] President Nursultan Nazarbayev has been 
interviewed by the information agency POSTFACTUM. The interview 
raised issues of dual citizenship and the language policy of our 
republic, prospects for integration processes in the CIS, the 
forthcoming elections to the parliament of Kazakhstan, and the 
personnel policy at the highest echelons of power. [Words 
indistinct] all Kazakhstanis are interested in the president's 
position on these issues. KAZTAG, having received this 
information through its own channels, presents it to the wide 
circle of readers. 
  If the Russian-speaking community in Kazakhstan does not 
have 
any problems, then why does the republic refuse to adopt a law 
on dual citizenship -- especially as Russia does not want to 
abandon its intention? 
  Our Constitution does not allow dual citizenship, said the 
president. But this is not what concerns people. In 10 months, 
154,000 Russians arrived in Kazakhstan, including 54,000 from 
Central Asia. There are those who are leaving the country. At 
present, migration has increased by [words indistinct] of 
Kazakhstan. This year, 300,000 of them left the country. The 
balance is not in our favor. But if we take the embassies of 
the United States, Israel, and other Western countries -- 
citizens of Russia queue there for exit visas and leave the 
country forever. Why don't we talk about this? To use 
emigration as an argument is political populism. 
  People are worried about a different thing. I have been told 
the following -- during the time of the present policy, which is 
pursued by Nazarbayev -- there is no reason for us [Russians] to 
worry. But we [Russians] should think about the future of our 
children. I do understand these people and therefore, by my 
statute, several amendments to the Constitution have been made. 
In particular, the original version says that the closest 
relations of Kazakhstanis wishing to move [word indistinct] have 
to wait from five to 10 years for citizenship. At present, the 
documents for getting citizenship should not be examined for 
more than six months. Apart from this the term during which 
Kazakhstanis should make up their mind with regard to 
citizenship, is extended until 1 March. 
  By the way, said Nazarbayev, I have sent to Boris Yeltsin 
and 
Viktor Chernomyrdin a draft agreement on the main principles for 
obtaining citizenship in Kazakhstan and Russia. I think we will 
sign it. 
  In accordance with this document, the negotiating sides 
pledge to urgently adopt relevant legislature that will simplify 
the procedure for obtaining citizenship both by Kazakhs and 
Russians. Their applications should be examined for no longer 
than six months from the day of submission [words indistinct]. 
I believe that this agreement will eliminate all problems. 
There is nothing there to divide Russians and Kazakhs. 
  Journalists displayed interest in the issue of the second 
language. [passage omitted] 
  Our Constitution enshrines that Russian is the language for 
interethnic communication, noted Nazarbayev. The main law 
clearly stipulates that the language for interethnic 
comminication is used along with the state language. [passage 
omitted] 
  Kazakh, the language of 8 million people, is on the brink of 
extinction. Due to this we have been forced to elevate it to 
the status of the state language. Russians themselves spoke 
about the need for that. [passage omitted] 
  POSTFACTUM asked President Nazarbayev to touch on the issue 
of international integration. 
  You know, I believe in prosperity through unification and 
not 
disintegration, said the president. Well I have not succeeded 
in maintaining the ruble zone. There is nothing we can do about 
it. We are not to be blamed for this. As an economist, I 
understand the Russian side but as a politician, I do not. The 
strategic loss of the ruble zone is Russia's loss. [passage 
omitted] By the way, said Nazarbayev, a draft of an economic 
union agreement belongs to Kazakhstan, a draft of the defense 
union has been submitted by Kazakhstan. A proposal to eliminate 
inter-state barriers has been put forward by Kazakhstan. You 
cannot lay any claims. This is my position -- useful contacts 
should not be disrupted. 
  Have you ever been reprimanded for a pro-Russian policy? 
  Yes, he admits. We do have our own nationalists. 
Fortunately there are not many of them. [passage omitted] 
  We are wrongly accused for pumping resources out of Russia. 
We have been told that in the old days, without Russia we would 
not survive. Now we neither depend on Russia for power supplies 
or for food. On the contrary, Russia owes more to Kazakhstan 
than Kazakhstan to Russia. [passage omitted] 
  Does Kazakhstan intend to take into consideration the 
Russian 
experience in elections? 
  Naturally we are going to take into consideration the 
experience of Russia, said the president. But we have a 
slightly different situation from Russia. [passage omitted] 
  During the news conference, journalists asked him about a 
rumor that is circulating in Kazakh political circles: That 
Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko is going to resign. 
  I do not have any intention to replace the prime minister, 
said the head of state. I do not think that any government has 
gained anything from replacing their prime ministers three or 
four times. The frequent change of prime ministers led to the 
situation that there is nobody in these republics with whom you 
can have business. In addition, Tereshchnko is an experienced 
leader. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Kazakh Foreign Minister Taleutay Suleymenov praised 
the Ashgabat Declaration at a news conference in Almaty Thursday 
[30 December]. 
  He highly appreciated the pledge made by CIS member states 
not to interfere into one another's internal affairs, respect 
one another's territorial integrity, never apply economic 
pressure and fight expansionism, chauvinism and ethnic enmity. 
  Suleymenov also stressed the importance of Ashgabat 
decisions 
on the setting up of a Commonwealth economic union. 
  "We should follow the example set by Western countries," he 
emphasized. In his view, if the CIS economic union is a 
success, a transnational currency may be negotiated.

Ministry] 
  [Text] The main issue for Kazakhstan in the military sphere 
is close military cooperation with the Russian Federation, 
according to an address by Kazakhstani Defense Minister Sagadat 
Nurmagambetov to the military department collegium. We quote 
from KAZAKHSTAN SARBAZY -- WARRIOR OF KAZAKHSTAN. Realistic 
conditions for such cooperation do exist, the minister stressed. 
The legal basis for this is the document on friendship and 
cooperation between Kazakhstan and Russia.

  [Text] Kazakhstan is as yet the only state in Central Asia 
that has adopted its own military doctrine. The document 
expounds a system of views on preventing war and on the 
development of national armed forces. Specialists consider 
Kazakhstan's military doctrine to be defense oriented and 
propose cooperating with the CIS countries and tackling common 
tasks in the military sphere. Multilateral and bilateral 
intergovernmental agreements and treaties should serve as the 
legal basis for interaction with the CIS countries in the 
defense sphere.

  [Text] Tajik and Afghan officials met at Sherkhan, a town 
in northern Afghanistan on the border with Tajikistan, on 
Wednesday [29 December]. Taking part in the meeting were Tajik 
Foreign Ministry officials, members of the Parliamentary 
Commission on Tajik Refugees' Repatriation and representatives 
of Afghanistan's National Islamic Movement, led by General 
Abdurashid Dustum. 
  The influential general controls large areas in northern 
Afghanistan on the border with Tajikistan. 
  His envoys are reported to have informed the other side of 
Kabul's readiness to put him in charge of Sherkhan. 
  His emissaries assured their Tajik counterparts that Dustum 
would do all he can to restore a transit camp for Tajik refugees 
at Sherkhan. In their words, Dustum's units will guarantee the 
safe return of Tajik fugitives to their homeland. 
  More than 50,000 Tajiks fled into Afghanistan at the peak of 
military hostilities there in 1992.

  [Text] The situation is still calm on the Tajik-Afghan 
border. The Russian troops stationed in Tajikistan informed 
INTERFAX, however, that the calm would be temporary. 
  The military link this with the positive results of Afghan 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani's visit to Tajikistan at the end 
of 1993, with the cold and snowy weather in the mountains and 
with rifts between Afganistan's various political forces. 
  A few days ago, two thirds of the Kazakh battalion operating 
in the territory of the Khorog border-guard unit in accordance 
with last year's Minsk agreement, were removed from Tajik 
territory. However, no replenishments have arrived yet, all of 
which may weaken this section of the Tajik-Afghan border.

  [Text] The chairman of the National Security Committee of 
Tajikistan, General Saidamir Zukhurov, has said that there is no 
real threat of Tajikistan's seizure from the outside, since the 
republic has enough forces to rebuff an aggression. 
  In an interview with Interfax Thursday, he said that the so- 
called "Tajik government in exile" does not present any threat 
to the republic's legitimate authorities. However, it will 
trouble the country and destabilize the social and political 
situation. 
  Zukhurov said that the Dushanbe authorities are prepared for 
talks with both the armed and political opposition. "It is up to 
them to have their say," he said.

  [Text] Tajikistan's Parliament has lifted the curfew in 
Dushanbe, Kurgan-Tyube, Kulyab, and Kalininabad as of midnight 
January 1 at citizens request because the situation in the 
cities has returned to normal. 
  The curfew and state of emergency were declared in the 
capital on January 6, 1993 and were imposed on Kurgan-tyube, 
Kulyab, and Kalininabad on March 30, 1993 to restore law and 
order, guarantee the citizens safety, confiscate weapons from 
illegal armed groups, curb pillage and other heinous crimes. 
  The curfew was in effect from midnight till dawn. 
  The state of emergency is still in force. 
  As Nikolay Majar, a senior interior ministry official, has 
told Interfax, not later than January 6, 1994, the state of 
emergency must be either lifted or prolonged since the decree on 
it is valid only for up to one year.

<F P=106> [New Year's message from President Saparmurad Niyazov in </F>
Ashgabat -- recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed friends and citizens of our Commonwealth. 
On the eve of the new year I send my best wishes for happiness 
and prosperity to everyone, to every family, to every region, 
and to every country. The end of the outgoing year and the 
results of the Ashgabat meeting of the Commonwealth heads of 
state have brought hope that in the interests of our peoples we 
can cooperate to mutual advantage. 
  The first steps in this direction have been taken. Openness, 
equal partnership, trust and the preservation of economic ties 
will help us overcome the difficulties. 
  As the new year approaches, everyone imagines peace in their 
own way. We in Turkmenistan are concerned not just about our 
own problems, but also about problems that arise for our 
Commonwealth partners. We are happy at every success of theirs. 
Turkmens say that peace and prosperity in the house of your 
neighbor are your peace and prosperity. So on this new year's 
eve, on behalf of the Turkmen people, I wish all of you peace 
and prosperity. 
  Let the new year bring you happiness, joy, and health. A 
happy new year to you!

  [Text] In his new year address Turkmenistan President 
Saparmurad Niyazov said that "most wishes and aspirations" of 
the country's residents for 1993 had materialized "with the help 
of Almighty Allah." 
  "Our country has met its targets in both the political and 
economic fields. Independent Turkmenistan which chose positive 
neutrality to be the overriding principle of its foreign policy 
has established itself in the CIS and other international 
organizations as a country which follows unswervingly its own 
road and has succeeded in reducing the world tension. By its 
courageous political and economic steps Ashgabat has on numerous 
occasions been in the center of attention," Niyazov said. 
  He added that it was necessary that relations with 
neighboring Iran, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan and Russia 
be based on mutual respect and equality. 
  "We are pleased with establishment of a new level of 
relations with the Russian state, he emphasized. When the 
Russian president stayed in Turkmenistan we signed important 
treaties which will maintain and improve the earlier good 
relations with the great neighbor and start equal, mutually 
beneficial cooperation." 
  Niyazov described the introduction of the national currency, 
the manat, as one of major events and expressed confidence that 
the manat will consolidate in 1994. (The official rate of 
exchange is now 601 ruble per manat - IF). 
  The president also said that the government had developed a 
concept of oil and gas production in the country until the year 
2020. As its own oil and gas policy are put into effect, 
Turkmenistan "will reach the level of developed countries," he 
emphasized. 
  In Niyazov's words, Turkmenistan's armed forces "will never 
be the cause of trouble for other countries" but "will not allow 
disturbing the peace and well-being in the republic."

  [Excerpts] Turkmenistan's President Saparmurad Niyazov left 
for a visit to the Islamic Republic of Iran early yesterday 
morning. Here is a report by our correspondent from Ashgabat 
Airport: [passage omitted] 
  [Begin Niyazov recording] [Words indistinct] we will visit 
many cities of Iran, we will meet people, we will meet Turkmens. 
We hope that the two peoples will live in peace and will not 
think about their tomorrow. We have important agreements 
between the two states on completing the railroad, on 
transporting gas; we have separate agreements on various 
branches of economy. During this visit, the issue of the border 
between the two countries is among the agreements to be signed. 
These are for the benefit of the Turkmen people. We are trying 
to help the Turkmen people to live without any worry. We wish 
this for the Iranian side, too. Therefore we will sign that 
agreement. We are very happy that the Iranian state and its 
president, our brother Rafsanjani, invited us. This is an 
important invitation [words indistinct]. This visit of ours is 
historical. I hope that this trip will enable the two countries 
to have continuous economic relations and [words indistinct]. 
[end recording] 
  President Saparmurad Niyazov was seen off at the airport by 
Sahatmuradov, speaker of the Turkmenistan Assembly, and other 
officials.

  [Text] In a surprise move, the Uzbek Government has 
suspended the publication of two Russian newspapers, PRAVDA and 
RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA. No formal explanation has been given. 
  Since the two papers are printed in Tashkent, the decision 
has affected subscribers not only in Uzbekistan but also 
Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and parts of Kazakhstan and 
Turkmenistan. 
  Local observers say RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA may have been punished 
because of its carrying of an article about LDP [Liberal 
Democratic Party] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in its December 
24 issue.

  [Text] All the people seeing out the old year and seeing in 
the New Year have their own problems, worries and experiences 
which are different from others. But I am convinced of one 
thing: All of them are united by the feeling that they wish 
peace and well-being, they wish well to, first, their families, 
children, close friends and relatives, the kray and the land 
they live on, the land which unites us all. 
  We should realize this can be achieved only if we are 
together. Only cooperation and mutual understanding can make 
this possible. We are practically destined for integration. 
  This New Year's Eve night I would like to address all the 
people. I wish to say the following: 
  People: Be vigilant! 
  People: Be happy!

  [Text] New Delhi January 3 TASS -- Uzbek President Islam 
Karimov is to arrive in Delhi on Monday afternoon for the 
beginning of a three-day official visit. The visit is expected 
to include the signing of six agreements which will determine 
the further development of Uzbek-Indian relations, in particular 
in the commercial and economic spheres. 
  Karimov is expected to hold talks with Indian Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao which will touch upon a wide range of bilateral 
and international questions. The Uzbek leader is also scheduled 
to give a speech at a meeting of the Confederation of Indian 
Industry. 
  As the "NATIONAL HERALD", a paper known to be close to 
Indian 
government circles, pointed out, "Uzbekistan desires to 
cooperate with India in the industrial and trade sectors in 
order to stimulate its privatisation process and the transition 
to a free market economy". Therefore the Uzbek delegation 
includes the heads of recently privatised key enterprises in the 
Middle Asian republic, according to the paper. 
  In its turn, India is ready to offer wholehearted help to 
the 
friendly ex-Soviet republic during this difficult transitional 
period of economic restructuring, the "NATIONAL HERALD" declared.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste comments to 
correspondent Uku Toom on the latest statements in connection 
with the withdrawal of Russian forces from Estonia. As is 
known, Russia has expressed a readiness to withdraw the forces 
from Estonia by 31 August 1994. 
  [Begin recording] [Toom] How do you assess that statement by 
Svirin [head of the Russian delegation for talks with Estonia on 
troop withdrawal] that Russia has already presented to Estonia a 
schedule of withdrawal of forces on 2 (?September)? 
  [Velliste] This corresponds to the truth, altogether, and 
Svirin has improvised a little on the theme of the schedule, 
that he has, by word of mouth, presented (?some considerations) 
approximately when [word indistinct] could go. But this has 
been a very approximate guidance, nothing has been put in 
writing and presented on paper. 
  [Toom] The Estonian Progress Party held a news conference 
and 
expressed doubts on the subject of all these talks. The 
Progress Party somehow casts suspicion about some kind of secret 
protocols with these talks, that Russia has demanded something 
as compensation for the withdrawal of forces, and that Estonia 
has probably promised in connection with, for example, the 
forces' pensioners. 
  [Velliste] If there was a secret protocol it would very 
quickly be revealed. There is no (?reason for) [word 
indistinct] in a democratic state. We have not a single 
essential thing that would not reach the newspapers, [words 
indistinct] (?in the nearest time) newspapers. Some kind of 
secret protocol could, in general, (?be checked) [words 
indistinct] living in a democratic state. [end recording]

  [Text] Tallinn, Dec 30, BNS - The Estonian Interior 
Ministry reports that the earlier announcement about the 
cessation of registration of Soviet passports for foreign travel 
on January 1 was erroneous. 
  Soviet foreign passports of foreigners living in Estonia on 
the basis of residence permits or as settlers who moved to the 
country before July 1, 1990 are registered in local bureaus of 
the citizenship department. A stamp of the department as well 
as an official stamp are put on the first page of the passport 
which is also signed by a bureau official. 
  A registered passport remains valid until July 12, 1995 or 
the end of the residence permit. 
  The Interior Ministry has advised persons planning foreign

<F P=106> [Report on interview with President Guntis Ulmanis by Mert </F>
Kubu in Riga; date not given] 
  [Text] Riga -- The Baltic countries must be given at least 
the status of associate members of NATO if they are to be able 
to feel secure after the Russian elections. Moral and economic 
support from Sweden and the other Nordic countries is also 
necessary in the new situation which has arisen, Latvian 
President Guntis Ulmanis, 54, said in an interview with DAGENS 
NYHETER. 
  In President Ulmanis' view the Latvians will not be able on 
their own to get the Russian troops to leave the strategic radar 
base in Skrunda in southwestern Latvia. World opinion and 
perhaps a third country in the West should help to put pressure 
on Moscow and Yeltsin. 
  It is the presence of the Russian troops which is the 
biggest 
problem in Latvia. It is true that the situation has improved 
somewhat recently as a result of "silent withdrawal." This week 
it was reported that the number of Russian troops had fallen 
from 17,000 to 13,000. But Moscow is also demanding to be 
allowed to keep the radar installation for at least another six 
years. The Skrunda installation, whose task it is to give early 
warning of intercontinental missiles, is not only a political 
problem. It is also destroying the environment because of its 
powerful magnetic fields. The trees in the woods are withering, 
animals, birds, and even people are being affected. 
  Ulmanis received DAGENS NYHETER at his temporary residence, 
an imposing patrician villa in Riga. The house has been lent by 
a Latvian woman who lives in exile in France. The president's 
security guards checked our bags. His office is enormous, the 
floor in front of his desk like a small dance floor. 
  Ulmanis had just returned from this week's crisis meeting of 
the three Baltic presidents in Tallinn. Concern after Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's great electoral success is great in the Baltic 
region. At the meeting the presidents -- Estonia's Lennart 
Meri, Lithuania's Algirdas Brazauskas, and Latvia's Ulmanis -- 
agreed on a common strategy and an appeal to the rest of the 
world. 
  Has President Ulmanis himself met Zhirinovskiy? 
  "No, never, nor do I want to meet him." 
  The response was rapid. 
  "Obviously we are worried that the Russian Liberal Democrats 
won so many votes. But life goes on. Now we will have to 
adjust our policy. I would like NATO to undertake a real 
analysis of the Russian election result and abandon its passive 
policy vis-a-vis the Baltic region." 
  "Partnership for peace" is not enough. A first step toward 
security is that the Baltic countries be given the status of 
associate members, Ulmanis said. He is hoping for much from the 
NATO summit early in the new year. 
  What does he expect of Sweden and the Nordic area? 
  "Moral support, to begin with, and this is something that is 
not so insignificant. But we must also be given help to put our 
economy in order, with capital investments and support with 
credits." 
  Are not the requirements in the proposed new citizenship law 
not too strict vis-a-vis non-Latvians? People will have to have 
lived in Latvia for at least ten years, be able to speak 
Latvian, and also annual quotas will be introduced limiting how 
many people can acquire citizenship. 
  No, President Ulmanis does not think so. The draft law is 
still undergoing its first reading in parliament. It will now 
be scrutinized by international organizations, including the 
Council of Europe. Ten years is perhaps a long time, he 
admitted, adding that he could perhaps imagine a "golden mean." 
But on one point it is impossible for the Latvians to give way: 
the language requirement. New citizens must be able to speak 
Latvian. 
  As a boy Ulmanis was deported to Siberia. What does he 
remember? 
  "A lot of snow. Very cold. I cannot remember ever 
satisfying my hunger. We were always thinking about a small 
country far away, about Latvia where the cows were brown and the 
meadows green and where people lived in harmony. That helped us 
to survive." 
  Guntis Ulmanis was clearly moved. "These are still painful 
memories," he explained. 
  So why has almost no one been brought to trial in the Baltic 
region for crimes against human rights during the years of 
occupation? 
  He believes that this is due to the fact that the communist 
period meant so much suffering, terror, and blood that people 
have still not gotten enough distance from it to be able to 
judge the guilty objectively. 
  "But the moment when we will be capable of doing so is very 
near," Ulmanis said. 
  What sort of Christmas is the Latvian people expecting? In 
the shadow of the Russian election result? With many poor 
people, even children begging on the streets of Riga? Rising 
crime? 
  Things are not easy for the old, the pensioners. Nor will 
all the farmers have a good Christmas, the president admitted. 
But he still hopes that Father Christmas will come to all, that 
people will light candles and forget the nationalists' successes 
in Russia. Despite everything Christmas 1993 is better 
economically than Christmas 1992. Economically Latvia is at 
rock bottom, but it is no longer sinking. Now things are 
starting to move upwards.

  [Text] Latvia intends to clearly formulate its proposals 
connected with the possibility of letting Russia maintain its 
radar station in Skrunda in the near future. Riga hopes that 
negotiations on this issue will continue, Foreign Minister 
Georgs Andrejevs told Interfax. 
  He deplored the circumstance that in 1993 Latvia and Russia 
did not succeed in reaching agreement on the main issue -- 
Russian troops withdrawal from Latvia. 
  However Russia's new initiatives aimed at stepping up the 
withdrawal of the remaining military units are a positive 
factor, the minister said. (Interfax's note: Russia proclaimed 
its willingness to withdraw its troops from Latvia before August 
31st, 1994, if it maintains control over the radar station in 
Skrunda for another six years). 
  Andrejevs also expressed concern about the circumstance that 
most Russians living in Latvia cast their ballots for Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party and for communists. "We 
have no illusions in regard to the sentiments of many Russians 
living in Latvia. Our practice shows that what motivates them 
is the desire to reverse the course of history and return to the 
recent past, not the striving for democracy," he said.

  [Excerpt] Riga, Dec 30, BNS -- The Latvian Cabinet granted 
the state police and the Home Guard temporary rights to search 
transportation vehicles, their drivers and passengers on the 
basis of grounded suspicion, beginning Dec. 31. 
  The government motivated the decision with the increasing 
abuse of firearms and explosives in the republic and the fact 
that criminals often use cars as means of transportation.

  [Text] Vilnius, Dec 30, BNS - The problem of Russian 
military transit through Lithuanian territory was a key topic in 
radio debates Thursday between Justas Paleckis, presidential 
foreign policy adviser, and Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the 
parliament's rightist opposition. 
  Paleckis said a solution acceptable to Lithuania, "which, of 
course, cannot be unilateral because interests must be 
coordinated," should be attained with the help of international 
organizations. 
  Landsbergis said Lithuania should not conclude any military 
treaties with Russia, to avoid the legalization of military 
transit. Lithuania can give permission for Russian transit in 
each separate case, he said, but denied allegations of wanting 
to completely ban military transit through Lithuanian territory.

<F P=106> [Report by Tamara Nikolayeva in the "Lithuania" column: "A </F>
Year Ago They Were Dissatisfied With Landsbergis and Now With 
Brazauskas. The Incumbent Authorities Have Little Time To 
Fulfill Their Pledges"] 
  [Text] Social tension in Lithuania is mounting. It is 
hard to tell to what extent this is due to the difficult 
situation in the socioeconomic sphere and to what extent to the 
artificial fanning of passions by representatives of the right 
opposition. Meanwhile, the industrial and agricultural 
production decline continues in the republic. The minimum wage, 
pensions, and student grants, with the start of the heating 
season when the owner of a two-room apartment has to pay more 
than 70 lits (an average pension) for public utility services, 
have lost any meaning even as a source of purely biological 
survival. At the other pole of society whole fortunes are 
emerging. At the same time, the basis of civilized capitalism 
-- a broad middle class -- is not being formed at all. 
  In November alone there were two major actions aimed against 
government socioeconomic policy. One of them was organized by 
pensioners and invalids, the other by land owners who even with 
falling production cannot sell even a small part of their output 
owing to the shrinking of the domestic market. Nor can they get 
any money for the products sold from the monopoly processors. 
  The social and economic complaints of both are quite 
understandable. Having served their purpose as a cause to 
express protest, however, they are now increasingly moving into 
the background under the pressure of political slogans and 
demands, the main ones being the resignation of the republic's 
present leadership, and early Seimas and presidential elections. 
  Seimas Chairman Cheslovas Yurshenas stated that the 
"rightists" have issued a challenge to the legally elected 
authority, taking advantage of the natural discontent of the 
people owing to the economic difficulties. The ruling majority 
in the Seimas assessed the November protest actions as the first 
patently demonstrated wish to overthrow the government after the 
"leftists'" one-year spell in office. The right opposition 
paper LETUVOS AYDAS is increasingly playing up the idea that 
early elections are simply vital. The independent TV-3 channel 
from Kaunas is conducting purposeful day-to-day propaganda 
against the republic's leadership. 
  The rightist opposition's trumps in this political game are 
indexation of the population's bank deposits and 
Lithuanian-Russian relations. The first card is apparently a 
sure win: Will there be many people capable of rejecting a 
100-fold indexation of deposits, as proposed by the right 
opposition in the person of former premier Gediminas Vagnorius? 
  The other trump -- Lithuanian-Russian relations -- in 
contrast to the first, is not such a "win-win" as before, when 
Russian troops were still in Lithuania. Most people in 
Lithuania understand the present leadership's aspiration to 
establish normal mutually advantageous economic relations with 
Russia, and this is being persistently demanded also by 
Lithuanian industrialists and entrepreneurs. Nonetheless, any 
positive shifts in Lithuanian- Russian relations are interpreted 
by the "rightists" as a "secret conspiracy with Moscow" and the 
intention by the authorities to fall into the Russian sphere of 
influence. The right opposition party, the Fatherland Union, 
created on the foundations of Sajudis and led by Vytautas 
Landsbergis and Gediminas Vagnorius, has expressed its concern 
over the accords reached in the course of a recent meeting in 
Vilnius between the Lithuanian and Russian presidents on setting 
up a commission to corporatize the gas pipeline passing across 
Lithuanian territory as well as two major Lithuanian enterprises 
using Russian raw materials -- Azotas in Ionava and Nafta in 
Mazheyka. The "rightists" interpret these accords as a threat 
not only to the economic but also political independence of 
Lithuania. 
  In the thick of the power struggle the "rightists" are not 
inclined to reckon either with considerations of economic 
expediency or the need to preserve social stability in order to 
overcome the crisis. Presumably the "rightists" suppose that at 
the present stage of the crisis there is every reason to hope 
for their advent to power through early elections. In this 
context the "leftists," incidentally, stated that last year's 
early elections, too, were staged by the "rightists" but the 
winner was the Democratic Workers Party of Lithuania [DWPL]. 
Today, however, the situation in Lithuania has changed 
substantially. At that time there was disappointment with the 
ruling Sajudis' policy and today the disappointment is no less, 
but this time with the DWPL. Of course, this party has received 
an unenviable legacy but its social policy pursued over the year 
has proved to be very far removed from its election pledges. 
  Nonetheless President Algirdas Brazauskas' popularity rating 
is still fairly high, running at least 10 points ahead of 
Vytautas Landsbergis'. The "leftists" have stated that they are 
not going to part with power until 1996 and that they will do 
everything to fulfill their election promises and lead the 
country out of the crisis. The "rightists," however, are 
pressing for a referendum to be held on the issue of early 
elections. Only if the present ruling majority, as represented 
by the DWPL, manages to adjust its social policy, will the idea 
of early elections possibly pass away, deprived of fertile soil.

  [Text] Having violated the cease-fire reached with the 
Russian mediation, the Azerbaijani troops have been launching 
constant attacks for the last two weeks now all along the entire 
front in Karabakh. 
  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Defense Army press service 
reported that the defensive positions in Mardakertskiy Rayon in 
the north, and those in Martuninskiy Rayon to the south have 
been coming under attack for the last day. The Karabakh Army 
units are successfully resisting the pressure of the Azerbaijani 
formations in both sectors. 
  The NKR Defense Army spokesman provided the following 
information concerning the enemy's losses since the Azerbaijani 
Army launched its latest offensive: Six Azerbaijani tanks and 
four armored cars were hit. Five captured tanks have already 
been repaired. The number of Azerbaijani troops and officers 
killed reach 700. 
  Some 42 soldiers were killed and three tanks destroyed on 
the 
Karabakh side. 
  In the opinion of the military observers, the huge losses 
suffered by the Azerbaijani Army are ascribed to the inclination 
of the new Azerbaijani leadership to achieve some military 
breakthrough for certain domestic political reasons. The same 
sources said that haphazardly formed and poorly trained 
infantrymen are being used in active combat operations against 
the Karabakh positions. 
  Another offensive was launched against the Karabakh 
positions 
to the north of Mardakertskiy Rayon at around 0730 this morning. 
After having lost two tanks and 40 infantrymen, the Azerbaijani 
units were forced to retreat to their initial positions.

  [Text] The Armenian Foreign Ministry sent a note to the 
Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry yesterday. The message states: 
Armenian Republic's rayon centers and settlements in 
Noyemberyanskiy, Idzhevanskiy, Tavushskiy have been subjected to 
unprecedented shelling by Grad launchers and long-range 
artillery from Azerbaijan's Tauzskiy and Kazakhskiy Rayons as of 
1030 on 29 December. 
  Certain sectors along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, 
particularly Sisianskiy Rayon, were also subjected to artillery 
shelling during the day. 
  Considerable material damage has been inflicted on these 
rayons. Material destruction has been caused, and there are dead 
and injured among the peaceful population. 
  Against the background of the large-scale offensive that was 
launched against Nagorno-Karabakh on 21 December, Azerbaijan's 
military operations cannot be interpreted as anything other than 
a renunciation of the process of peaceful resolution of the 
Karabakh problem and another attempt to drag Armenia into the 
war. 
  The Armenian Foreign Ministry is making a firm protest to 
the 
Azerbaijani side, stressing that such a policy is dangerous for 
the stability of the entire region and does not conform with the 
position of the international community. 
  By rejecting the efforts of the CSCE's Minsk Group, the 
peacemaking mediation of the Russian Federation, and the UN 
Security Council resolutions, Azerbaijan has virtually isolated 
itself from the international community. 
  By firmly rejecting such a political stance by the 
Azerbaijani side, the Armenian Foreign Ministry is authorized to 
declare that Armenia reserves the right to respond in a like 
manner if these operations are repeated. 
  At the same time, we appeal to the sagacity of the 
Azerbaijani side and call on it be realistic and resolve its 
problems with Nagorno-Karabakh exclusively through peaceful 
means and in conformity with the internationally accepted norms.

  [Text] On 29 December, in the evening, Armenian President 
Levon Ter-Petrosyan had four telephone conversations with the 
president of Azerbaijan, Mr. Heydar Aliyev. The Armenian 
president demanded from his Azeri counterpart to stop the 
bombardment of the Noyemberyan, Idzhevan and Daush districts of 
the Republic of Armenia at once or else the Armenian side will 
similarly respond to the Azeri side. 
  The ARMENPRES news agency, quoting Armenian Defence Ministry 
sources, said that after the telephone conversation of the 
Armenian president with Aliyev the bombardment of the 
northeastern districts of Armenia stopped at once. The 
situation there is reported calm during the night and during the 
day.

<F P=106> [New Year's message from President Levon Ter-Petrosyan to </F>
the Armenian people--live] 
  [Text] Dear compatriots, I do not want to hide the fact 
that it is difficult to make an appropriate (?toast) to the 
presidential message on the occasion of the new year. 
  I want to analyze the current situation without any 
(?intention) of self-justification or escaping criticism. 
  In my yearly report to the parliament a few days ago [words 
indistinct]. I think that deputies should be generally 
satisfied with the (?explanations) given. 
  The situation in our newly independent state is very [words 
indistinct]. Not only our daily tables but also the festive 
tables are poor or almost empty. And we could still face new 
difficulties and even graver days. Hard work [word indistinct] 
will remain an inseparable part of our lives for a long time to 
come. 
  This is the result of the state's emergence from the fall of 
empires. [words indistinct] Scores of years are needed for the 
creation of a secure and prosperous state. If anyone promises 
you something else, do not believe him. They have fed you for a 
long time with talk of miracles, but miracles happen only in 
fairy tales. 
  At present, as a people and government we are solving one 
single problem: evading the (?revival) [word indistinct] of the 
Soviet Union. We must note with utmost pride that we are 
successfully solving that problem. That success is evident in 
Armenia's balanced foreign policy, the full governability of the 
situation, and the internal stability in the Republic. The 
(?collapse) of any of these three political factors is fraught 
with far graver consequences than the ones generated by price 
increases and the fall in the standard of living, which are 
temporary phenomena that can be corrected. 
  Armenia's successes [words indistinct] become more 
conspicuous when compared to the countries sharing the same 
fate. It is an undeniable fact that not only Georgia, 
Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, which were more or less at our 
level, but also strong Russia could not escape internal tremors. 
  Armenia's success was not mere chance, but above all the 
result of wisdom displayed by the people and hard work by the 
state structures. Despite all the defects and shortcomings, the 
state's role cannot be (?denied) in this success. While proudly 
noting this fact, we must protect and deepen this valuable 
success in the coming year because times are still very 
dangerous and the situation is extremely (?complex). 
  At this moment I do not want to touch on current affairs, 
such as the stabilization of industry, regulation of the 
currency circulation, promotion of trade, elimination of 
irregularities, economic reforms, and wage indexation. This is 
not because I do not think that these problems are important, 
but because it is impossible to talk about them since other more 
fundamental problems are the main cause of these difficulties. 
  The first is the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict, 
or more correctly, the establishment of peace in 
Nagorno-Karabakh. Despite the success of the Karabakh 
self-defense Army, the continuation of the war is fraught with 
serious danger that threatens the Armenian people's security and 
prosperity. 
  Because of the war, Armenia is being subjected to a blockade 
imposed not only by Azerbaijan and Turkey but also by 
international financial organizations, who are imposing open and 
covert sanctions. Therefore, to talk about Armenia's economic 
development and improvement in the people's living conditions is 
tantamount to engaging in self-delusion or political 
speculation, which is being successfully implemented by certain 
opposition forces. Because the war is continuing, no 
substantial improvement can be made in the Republic's economy 
and the people's standard of living no matter who is in power. 
  The Armenian authorities' position on the Nagorno-Karabakh 
conflict has been and continues to remain the same: The 
peaceful settlement of the conflict and a mutually agreed upon 
solution. The Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh authorities have 
given a positive reply to the CSCE Minsk Group's peace plan, as 
well as to the mediation initiative of the Russian Federation. 
Therefore, the establishment of the peace depends not on the 
Armenian side but on Azerbaijan's position and on the 
coordination of the peace efforts of the international community 
and Russia. I can inform you that there is movement that 
inspires hope in both directions. 
  The second fundamental problem facing us is the adoption of 
the Armenian Constitution. Its centerpiece is the legislative 
guarantee of human and civil rights, the clear division of 
power, and the ensurance of the unimpeded and effective 
functioning of the government. At first glance this problem 
looks academic, in view of the burden of numerous daily 
problems, but it also has practical significance. The adoption 
of the Constitution will undoubtedly discharge the atmosphere of 
the political conflict and will give the opportunity to [word 
indistinct] redirect our people's spiritual and intellectual 
potential towards constructive and creative labor. 
  And, finally, the third main problem affecting our normal 
course is to ensure energy independence for Armenia. Under the 
conditions of the blockade, the work on this matter means 
continuing to find alternate energy sources. We hope that the 
drilling work to find the Republic's underground resources will 
begin soon. However, the possibility of reopening the Armenian 
nuclear power plant is the most concrete and realistic source of 
energy. The preliminary work connected with its reopening has 
already been completed and I want to inform you with pleasure 
that in the opinion of experts this work is (?satisfactory). 
The production of power by the nuclear plant is scheduled to 
begin toward the end of next year. 
  That is peace, Constitution, and nuclear power plant; these 
are our slogans for the new year, 1994. 
  Happy new year to you.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Armenian Government in Yerevan; </F>
date not given] 
  [Text] Armenian Deputy Prime Minister Vigen Chitechyan and 
Armenian State Minister Gagik Shakhbazyan are in Tbilisi for 
talks with Georgian leaders on repairing the bombed gas pipeline 
and improving freight transportation. 
  The Azerbaijani Army used insolent force against the 
representatives of the Armenian leadership, the Georgian 
experts, and the security forces who had gone to repair the gas 
pipeline that was blown up on 24 December in the Azeri-inhabited 
region in Georgia's Marneulinskiy Rayon, north of Armenia. In 
this way, the Azerbaijani Army virtually prevented the start of 
repair work on the gas pipeline. 
  The Armenian Government views this action as a gross 
interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. Such 
interference creates tension that is fraught with new and 
unpredictable consequences for the region. 
  The Government of the Armenian Republic hopes that the 
Georgian authorities will take the appropriate measures to 
prevent infringements by the Azerbaijani side and that the 
Azerbaijani leadership will refrain from carrying out acts of 
sabotage in another country that directly affect Armenia's vital 
interests.

  [Text] Yerevan, December 29 (SNARK) -- Today the Armenian 
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan has a phone talks with Eduard 
Shevardnadze, the Head of the Georgian state. As SNARK was 
informed at the press-center of the Armenian president, a 
problem of cargo conveyance for Armenia and the restoration of 
gas pipe-line damaged in the Marneul region in Georgia was 
discussed. 
  In the opinion of most observers, transit Armenian cargo's 
plundering has got in Georgia a kind of official character. As 
a result, hundreds of railroad cars and trucks don't get [to] 
their destination places in Armenia. Georgia takes the most 
part of gas from Turkmenistan, for which Armenia has already 
paid in gold. Vazgen Sargisyan, the Armenian state minister, has 
said recently that "the Armenian government has to feed not only 
Armenia but also Georgia."

  [Text] The center of Sociological Research at the Armenian 
Academy of Sciences headed by Gevork (Bobosyan), based on the 
opinion polls conducted in November and December 1993, have come 
to the conclusion that about 80 percent of the urban population 
of Armenia are incapable of purchasing the basic foodstuffs 
after the introduction of the national currency, the dram. 
  The level of monthly income is insufficient to buy the 
necessary food in the minimal amounts. One kilogram of butter, 
1kg of sugar, 1kg of cheese, meat, and at least 5kg of potatoes, 
to say nothing of the expenses (?and) public utilities 
transportation, and which is most important today, kerosene and 
wood for heat. 
  According to the experts at the center the coming indexation 
of wages will lead to greater forestalling increase in prices on 
the market which will only make things worse. [sentence as 
heard] The state of the Armenian economy nowadays is such that 
a sweeping indexation of wages for all budget enterprises 
without a differentiation by the level of income will result in 
further decrease in living standards the growth of inflation and 
the fall of the dram rate. In such a situation it would be more 
advisable to redistribute the money reserved for indexation and 
spend it on guaranteed rationing of basic foodstuffs in minimal 
amounts at least for that part of the urban population whose 
income is not higher than 100 drams per family member. 
  The introduction of food cards for low income families 
proposed by the analysts of the center will not affect the other 
groups of population (?so it) would not promote the further 
growth of prices and hyperinflation. On the contrary, it will 
to some extent soften the disastrous situation we are facing 
this winter.

of Agdam, Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry said. 
  The Armenians concentrated most of their attacking troops, 
supported by 20 tanks and armored personnel carriers, in the 
area between Agdam and Barda. The Azerbaijani army has put up a 
stiff defense, the ministry said. It said the Armenians, in the 
past 24 hours, had lost three armored vehicles, two cannon and 
one Grad multiple-rocket launcher. 
  Fighting was also raging on Friday around the border between 
Fizuli and Beylagan Districts, where Armenian forces were 
attacking Azerbaijani positions near the Agburun strategic 
height.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement by the Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign </F>
Affairs; date not given] 
  [Text] Armenia's armed aggression against Azerbaijan 
continues to bring misfortunes to the Republic's people. The 
recent intensification of the aggression is yet another 
confirmation of Armenia's [words indistinct]. 
  Armenia is making an effort to occupy new areas in 
Azerbaijan 
in total disregard of the peaceful initiatives made by several 
international organizations and foreign countries. Massing 
reinforcements and heavy military hardware, the Armenian Armed 
Forces intensely shelled Azerbaijan's Kazakhskiy, Tauzskiy, and 
Akstafa Rayons and the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic's Sadarak 
Rayon with rocket launchers and artillery units during the past 
few days. The wave of shelling began on 26 December. More 
than 100 Grad rockets and (?artillery shells) fell on 
Azerbaijan's peaceful border towns and several quarters in 
Kazakh City. Consequently, many peaceful people have been 
killed and several schools, medical centers, and means of 
transportation have been destroyed. 
  The Armenian Armed Forces, supported with armored vehicles, 
have prepared to launch an attack from the previously occupied 
Agderinskiy, Agdamskiy, and Fizulinskiy Rayons. Regardless of 
the losses they have suffered in their attacks earlier, they 
have not abandoned their attempts. In addition to the acts of 
violence, our republic is also being subjected to a ferocious 
propaganda campaign, which is being waged not only by Armenia's 
media organs but also by the parliament of that republic. The 
objective behind their unfounded statements and reports is to 
camouflage Armenia's policy of aggression against Azerbaijan and 
mislead the world on the situation. 
  The Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs is convinced that 
Armenia will be completely responsible for the consequences of 
the intensified aggression against Azerbaijan. The aggression 
will lead to new losses and create additional misfortunes for 
the peoples of the two countries. 
  Azerbaijan urges the United Nations and international 
organizations to condemn Armenia's aggression and impose 
political and economic sanctions against that republic.

15 km north of the Sarsan water reservoir but were contained by 
Azeri troops. However, there was further fighting there on 
Sunday. 
  The source said the Armenians lost two tanks and one 
artillery piece in Saturday's battle close to the towns Geranboy 
and Ter-Ter. However, nearby Azeri villages came under heavy 
artillery fire from Armenian forces on Sunday morning. 
  Last night, a number of Azeri villages in the Belagan region 
were brought under rocket fire by Armenian units. But no word 
is given of casualty or destruction. 
  President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan on Saturday issued a 
decree to award a large group of officers and men for 
"successful defense operations," the defense ministry said.

  [Text] The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry has accused 
Armenia of escalating hostilities in Nagorno-Karabakh. In its 
statement published today, the ministry points out that this "is 
another evidence of the annexationist policy" pursued by Yerevan. 
  The ministry stated that "all responsibility for the new 
round of hostilities entirely rests with Armenia whose actions 
doom the people of Azerbaijan and its own people to new victims 
and sufferings" calling on the world community to condemn the 
Armenian aggression and impose efficient political and economic 
sanctions against it. 
  The statement points out that the Armenian side neglects 
peacekeeping efforts by both international organizations and 
individual states attempting to seize more territories of 
Azerbaijan. 
  The ministry said Armenians had been shelling and rocketing 
the bordering districts of Azerbaijan situated in the north-west 
of the republic since December 26 as well as the village of 
Sadarak belonging to the Nakhichevan autonomous republic. 
Armenian units undertook an attempt to launch an offensive on 
the north and south of Azerbaijan. The ministry said civilian 
villages suffered heavy damages from hundreds of shells and 
rockets leaving victims and destroying homes, schools, hospitals 
and transport communications.

  [Text] Baku (December 31) TURAN -- "Ankara will not agree 
to ship the oil tankers through the Bosporus", said the 
Ambassador of Turkey to Azerbaijan, Altan Karamanoglu, to a 
Turan's reporter. 
  The matters concerning the ways of Azeri and, in prospect, 
Kazakhstani oil to Europe has yet to be considered. Russia 
suggests that oil should be shipped to the Black Sea's port of 
Novorossiysk and then by tankers to Europe. However, Turkey 
disagrees saying that this variant is oecologically dangerous. 
  "We can not put at stake ten-million Stambul city", said the 
Ambassador Karamanoglu. 
  Turkey as well as a number of the countries suggest that 
Azeri oil should be shipped to the port of Iskenderun 
(Mediterranean Sea) through the oil pipe-line and then by 
tankers to Europe. Azerbaijan insists on laying the pipe-line 
through Iran, Nakhichevan and Turkey.

<F P=106> [Interview with cosmonaut Valeriy Baberdin by Sergey </F>
Turchenko; place and date not given: "Unemployment in the 
Skies"] 
  [Text] Our country has always been a great space power. 
No one can, or ever will, dispute its pioneering role in space. 
Admittedly, this applies to the "accursed communist past." The 
blessed "democratic" present has relegated the state to the 
backwaters of space research. The year now ending -- the year 
of the triumph of Yeltsinism -- has been particularly dreadful 
in this respect. State programs for the development of 
cosmonautics have totally withered away. The "Energiya" Science 
and Production Association, that major achievement of 
contemporary civilization, is on the verge of bankruptcy. There 
is unemployment among cosmonauts. The end of the year has 
brought a further extremely cruel blow directed against the 21st 
century: the signing by U.S. Vice President Gore and 
Chernomyrdin of what is for Russia a shackling agreement on 
creating a joint orbital station that will be the biggest ever. 
This was the subject with which we kicked off our conversation 
with cosmonaut and researcher Colonel Valeriy Vasilyevich 
Baberdin. 
  [Baberdin] If you look no further ahead than today, the 
agreement seems to be to Russia's advantage. The economy is in 
such a plight that the state is unable to properly subsidize the 
space industry. Our superhigh-technology production units are 
coming to a standstill or are on the verge of shutting down, and 
tens of thousands of highly professional specialists are 
threatened with unemployment. And now the Americans are 
offering $400 million to build the "Alpha" orbital station, as 
they call it. This may breathe life into our space complex for 
a while. But the question is the price we will pay for this 
temporary revival. Let us try to weigh up everything. 
  The development of cosmonautics in the USSR and the United 
States took different routes. The Americans got carried away 
with the shuttle and did not develop orbital stations. Now they 
have realized how necessary these are for research activity. 
They have calculated, pondered, and reflected: It is too 
expensive to start from scratch, it is considerably cheaper to 
utilize Soviet experience and potential, which are now available 
to them. 
  First, America does not have the technology for constructing 
stations in orbit. Only we have it. Second, the Americans have 
not developed sufficiently cheap and at the same time efficient 
carrier rockets to take the components and modules of a station 
into orbit. We still have the world's best fleet of such 
rockets. Third, they have no methods for training cosmonauts for 
long stints in an orbital station. Their missions last two 
weeks, ours last six months, a year, or even more. All these 
unique technologies and methods will go to them as a free gift 
together with the station we have contracted to build. 
  [Turchenko] But "Alpha" is intended as a joint venture, so 
we too will use the station.... 
  [Baberdin] I'm afraid there's a lot of eyewash here, just as 
there is with the numerous commercial joint ventures that have 
proliferated in Russia. It's not a matter of my own misgivings. 
Many specialists in Zvezdnyy [Gorodok] and the "Energiya" 
Science and Production Association are voicing serious fears in 
this regard. I received confirmation of them the other day from 
a conversation with a U.S. TV journalist specializing in space 
topics. He was frank. The United States is telling taxpayers: 
Look, Gore managed to reach agreement with Chernomyrdin and we 
have saved a lot of money. In the long term control of "Alpha" 
will be transferred to Houston, and missions to it will mostly 
be flown by shuttles on U.S. programs. 
  [Turchenko] So do we risk entering the 21st century with 
our main flight control center in Houston and an auxiliary one 
in Kaliningrad outside Moscow? 
  [Baberdin] It is even possible our center may become merely 
a museum, like the Cosmonaut Training Center. According to this 
project of the century, which will take practically all our 
space resources, Houston will also train our payload 
specialists, as the Americans call them. The point is that in 
the shuttle there is an upper deck housing the crew and a lower 
deck for the "passengers" -- the payload specialists who are 
being taken to work at the station. I am afraid we may all find 
ourselves on the lower deck of the U.S. craft in both the 
literal and metaphorical senses. 
  [Turchenko] Well, we are going to pay all too high a price 
for these $400 million. Incidentally, the figure is noteworthy. 
That is precisely the size of the contract that was being 
readied with India for the sale of carrier rocket technologies. 
But the Americans twisted our government's arm and forced it to 
abandon this contract. 
  [Baberdin] Correct. From that same conversation with an 
American TV journalist I learned that the United States is using 
"Alpha" to harness us to it mainly in order to prevent the 
spread of space technology. Obviously we lost nothing as a 
result of the Indian option, we merely gained, including that 
same sum of 400 million, whereas now.... There is also 
something else that is clear to me as a cosmonaut awaiting his 
turn for a mission: The "Alpha" project promises even more 
persistent unemployment among Russian cosmonauts. 
  [Turchenko] To what extent is that a factor at present? 
  [Baberdin] I cannot give precise figures, but I can offer a 
broad estimate. t present among cosmonauts alone there are 
around 15-16 people awaiting their turn for a mission. But 
there are also sizable reserve groups of specialists who have 
completed the training course. I will mention just a few. A 
detachment of women cosmonauts was once created on the basis of 
the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems. The intention 
was to put an "all-female crew" into space. Economic problems 
made all this a remote prospect. A group of young scientists 
underwent training for research work in space. They too are no 
longer wanted. The military department designed its own "Almaz" 
orbital station. A subunit of military engineers was trained to 
work on it. Just a handful of them went into space; the rest 
had no luck. There are doctors in a similar position. The Test 
Flight Institute picked a subunit made up of the best test 
pilots and trained them for two years on "Buran" and...a halt 
has now been called. So just estimate how many space unemployed 
we have, so to speak. At the same time we have been forced to 
sell places in craft and the orbital station to foreign 
cosmonauts. 
  [Turchenko] But Russia at least has access to the results of 
their research? 
  [Baberdin] No. All materials are stored on diskette and our 
foreign colleagues take the experimental data with them. The 
only plus is that they usually leave us the research apparatus 
they have used in token of gratitude. Moreover, in preparing 
this apparatus for missions, our specialists acquire skills in 
using it. 
  [Turchenko] The year 1993 is drawing to its end.... Our 
country always used to proudly sum up the results of the space 
year, which were usually truly impressive. What about nowadays? 
  [Baberdin] There is a certain amount of momentum from past 
achievements and successes. As is well known, for several 
months know Vasiliy Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov have been 
working selflessly in orbit. But this year there was an 
incident that could not have happened before. Viktor Afanasyev, 
Yuriy Usachev, and Valeriy Polyakov were supposed to go up to 
the "Mir" station back in the fall. But the carrier rocket was 
not ready. The "Progress" plant had made the casing, but the 
engines.... The Samara Engine Plant had ceased producing them 
because it was on the verge of bankruptcy, like "Progress," 
incidentally. Now they have found in store Russian State 
Committee for Hydrometeorology carrier rockets designed to 
launch "Meteor" satellites. Attempts are being made to adapt 
one of them for a manned craft. But it is capable of placing 
only a two-man crew in orbit. We have been forced to postpone 
the mission until 1994. A search for a solution to the problem 
is now under way. 
  [Turchenko] Yes, this is indeed a new chapter in our 
cosmonautics. What are your forecasts for the future? 
  [Baberdin] Until we grow a little wiser, we will build a 
station in order to develop American space travel. Such is the 
lot of a state that has suddenly decided to kiss goodbye to its 
own great history and to the status of a world space power and 
is voluntarily following in the wake of foreign interests.

<F P=106> [Interview with Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir </F>
Zhirinovskiy by unidentified correspondent in an office setting; 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Astrologer Pavel Globa] I am stating this with full 
responsibility, 1994 will be worse than 1993. It will be worse, 
much worse. Civil war is the only thing we will not have. 
There will be no dictatorship. Everyone is bracing themselves 
for a dictatorship, claiming that Zhirinovskiy will come to 
power now and there will be a dictatorship. No, he will not 
come to power, do you understand this? Zhirinovskiy will not 
rule, there will be a coalition. In the future, strange as it 
may sound, this coalition will acquire a civilized form. In 
1995, I do not see Zhirinovskiy having such a huge effect on 
politics any more. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Will Pavel Globa's forecast 
regarding Vladimir Zhirinovskiy come true? We will see. Some 
of his predictions are already coming true, as it appears. The 
year of 1993, which had apparently brought Vladimir Volfovich 
Zhirinovskiy a triumphant election victory, prepared for him 
some unpleasant surprises as well. Zhirinovskiy's foreign tour 
was not exactly strewn with roses. The Bulgarian authorities, 
in simple terms, forced the leader of the Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] out of the country, and the German 
Government straightforwardly refused him a visa. [Video shows 
Zhirinovskiy speaking to an unidentified correspondent in an 
office sitting under an emblem showing an eagle holding in his 
beak a banner with the slogan: Freedom, LDP, Law, and hovering, 
in burning sun rays, above a big white schematic map that 
includes Alaska, all of the former Soviet Union, Finland, and 
extending some way westward into Europe, with Russia written on 
it in capital letters] 
  [Zhirinovskiy] This is normal political life -- politics do 
not exist without it. To grant a visa or not to grant a visa, 
to welcome or not to welcome. It all depends on who has arrived 
in the country. All Bulgarians are unhappy with their life, and 
in me they have seen the opportunity of another president 
appearing in Bulgaria, of a new political leadership. This 
provoked hatred and anger from the local political elite who are 
in power in Bulgaria today -- these werewolves, chameleons, 
former communists like Zhelu Zhelev and his team. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What about Germany? In 
principle, is the refusal to grant a visa connected with 
Bulgaria in any way? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, it is all connected. When Germans saw 
the Bulgarian people warming up to me in such a way -- thousands 
of people chanting Russia, Russia -- they were afraid that if I 
cross the border into Germany, I will agitate German public 
opinion in favor of other forces, not those who are in power in 
Germany. They had already refused me a visa in September, so 
this is not the first time. 
  They refused me a visa in September when I was going to a 
convention of the German People's Union, so I picketed the 
German consulate. Two hours later, the consul phones me here 
and says: God forbid, Vladimir Volfovich, please remove the 
pickets, we are issuing your visas. So the visas were issued 
and I went there. Same thing now: The collegium of Germany's 
Foreign Ministry is having a meeting to figure out what to do. 
We have refused him, right, but what if he becomes president in 
the spring? Relations between Russia and Germany will be much 
worse. Germany is in a state as it is, with Turks and other 
problems. That is politics for you. 
  I was in Europe, and what a shame. All the brothels are full 
of Russian women. What have we brought up our daughters for? 
All brothels, bars, night clubs and discos -- anywhere where 
one jumps into bed for shillings, francs, or marks -- Russian 
girls are there. This is a shame! 
  [Unidentified correspondent] But here in Moscow as well... 
  [Zhirinovskiy interrupting] I agree, but that is in our 
motherland. At least the girl will come back home after work. 
Over there, a girl works as if in a zoo. They come to the zoo 
to watch, let us say, a lion or a kangaroo. Same here: She is 
sitting there, half naked, and turns over 50 clients a day. 
That is different: It is one thing to go to bed here, once a 
week, if one is short of money for a dress, for instance, and 
another thing to work day in, day out. An Austrian, or a German 
or French girl will not work every day. There are Thais, 
Filipinos, Argentinians -- and Russians. Rich, isn't it? This 
is a monstrous, revolting thing -- in two and a half years, to 
turn the country into a dustbin, into a latrine -- and to push 
the young ones into prostitution. It is time to smash all this 
as quickly as we can.

<F P=106> [Ravil Mustafin article under "Opinion" rubric: "The Arab </F>
East: Compass of Security"] 
  [Text] The visit to Moscow by Kuwaiti Defense Minister 
Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah, the signing of the intergovernmental 
agreement on cooperation in the military sphere, and the 
subsequent exercise by ships of the two countries in the Persian 
Gulf have elicited lively comments both in the East (the Arab 
East, above all) and in the West. 
  The first thing they noticed was that Russia is striving for 
a colossal arms market. Kuwait, which intends to spend 
approximately $12 billion over 10 years on acquiring weapons, 
really does represent a highly favorable trading partner. Well, 
it would be the height of hypocrisy to deny that Russia is 
motivated exclusively by altruism [sentence as published]. The 
Arab East is of definite interest to us also from the viewpoint 
of replenishing our more than meager currency reserves. 
Particularly since it seems that we will not receive any 
palpable aid from the West. The fears of the United States, 
Britain, and France, which have taken up key positions on the 
arms markets, about a possible Russian breakthrough into this 
territory are indeed understandable. 
  It seems to me that the chief thing is not only and not so 
much the financial opportunities which the arms trade promises 
as the fact that Russia is at last starting to aspire to (or, at 
any rate, is making a serious bid for) the role of one of the 
guarantors of the security system in a very difficult region of 
the globe. At the same time, Russia is also taking care of its 
own interests. If only because of our geographic proximity to 
the southern borders of the CIS, there exists a real danger of 
the spread, or "overflowing," of instability across our borders. 
To be more precise, the simple configuration of the potentials 
for conflict in the Caucasus (the "Caucasian knot") and in the 
Persian Gulf region could produce a totally different quality of 
confrontation in this segment of the "arc of crises." 
  Moscow has a vital interest in preserving peace and 
stability 
in this region also because the Gulf zone is the source of such 
terrible dangers as narcotics trafficking, an uncontrolled arms 
trade, and so-called extraterritorial threats. Finally, some 
states are drawing up ambitious plans to create weapons of mass 
destruction. Their possible use close to the borders of Russia 
and the CIS is fraught with very unpredictable consequences. 
Moreover, from the military viewpoint the presence of 
unfriendly forces in the region could in time become a lever to 
exert pressure on our country. 
  In our view Saudi Arabia can be the main link in the system 
of security in the Persian Gulf region. Whereas prior to the 
war in the Persian Gulf the balance of power here was maintained 
chiefly thanks to the Iranian-Iraqi standoff, now there is 
hidden, indistinct rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The 
Saudis, who for a long time preferred to act exclusively by 
peaceful means, have decided to try independently to create 
armed forces capable of responding to any regional challenge to 
their security. 
  The bitter experience of proximity to such dangerous 
countries as Iraq and, to some extent, Iran has made Riyadh make 
substantial corrections to its defense concept. In practice 
this has resulted in huge military purchases thanks to which 
Riyadh has become the world's biggest arms importer. It 
accounts for more than one-third of all the arms supplied to the 
third world. 
  The Saudis should not, however, be condemned for 
overmilitarization. They have something to defend and the right 
to defend it. Particularly as the arms being acquired and the 
building of the army are aimed not at expansion (the Saudis have 
no need of other people's property -- they have more than enough 
of their own) but defense. Once bitten, twice shy. 
  Of course, the growth in the strength of the Saudi Army's 
armed forces is limited by the country's total human resources, 
which are comparable with Iraq's but considerably inferior to 
Iran's. In addition, Saudi generals have no experience of 
waging combat operations. In practical terms, the army has not 
come under fire. It will take many years to create really 
battleworthy armed forces. No wonder, in this connection, that 
the Saudis' defensive concept is geared above all to support 
from the U.S. armed forces. 
  Of course, Riyadh's close ties with Washington determine a 
certain regional preponderance of forces in favor of the United 
States. Therefore Russia's more active -- to one degree or 
another -- participation in the regional security system would 
meet Moscow's interests. But this is not the only reason. 
Riyadh, being the official custodian of the chief Islamic holy 
places in Mecca and Medina, is opposed to religious extremism in 
politics. Possessing indisputable authority in the world of 
Islam, it could also play a more active role in settling local 
conflicts on CIS territory, particularly in the so-called new 
Muslim states. 
  I believe that these arguments will suffice to acknowledge 
Russia's right to be concerned about peace and security in the 
Arab East.

  [Text] The key to reaching a settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina lies in Belgrade. That is why Russia's 
Western partners, such as European Union members, refuse to 
support Moscow's call for suspending and subsequently lifting 
sanctions against Yugoslavia, a high-ranking official from the 
Russian Foreign Ministry told Interfax. 
  Russia works on the assumption, he said, that after the 
signing of an agreement on settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
sanctions should be suspended and gradually lifted as the 
agreement begins to be implemented. "Unfortunately, such an 
agreement failed to be signed at the Geneva round of talks 
attended by spokesmen for all the warring sides -- Serbs, 
Muslims and Croats -- and by the foreign ministers of European 
Community countries. The reason for this was the dispute over 
territories between Bosnian Serbs and Muslims," the diplomat 
said. 
  As a result Bosnian Serbs are losing in tactical terms. 
Western analysts see in their actions, not without grounds, 
elements of the plan to form "Greater Serbia," that is join the 
Serb-populated areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina to Yugoslavia." 
  According to Interfax's interviewee, a clear stand taken by 
Belgrade could put an end to fears felt by the West and draw the 
lifting of sanctions nearer. "It's obvious that the pressure 
Belgrade could exert on Bosnian Serbs with a view to signing a 
peace agreement as soon as possible would draw nearer not only 
an end to the bloodshed in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also the 
lifting of sanctions against Belgrade and Yugoslavia's return to 
the world community," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jurij Trushin, representative of the Russian </F>
Federation in Macedonia, by Moscow correspondent Mirce 
Adamcevski; place and date not given: "Macedonian Policy -- the 
Future in the Balkans"] 
  [Text] Moscow, December--The Russian Federation has 
recently appointed Jurij Petrovich Trushin [name as published] 
as its permanent representative to the Republic of Macedonia. 
He is a professional diplomat, involved in the Balkans for 20 
years. His dissertation was on the Balkans, and he has also 
written a number of scientific works related to this region. He 
has spent more than 10 years working in the diplomatic service 
in Bulgaria. This year, he has been engaged in the global 
problems of that part of Europe. He has been professionally and 
scientifically linked to the Balkans for more than 20 years. 
  [Adamcevski] Mister Trushin, how do you view your 
appointment to the post of permanent representative of the 
Russian Federation in Macedonia? 
  [Trushin] This appointment to Macedonia is a great honor for 
me. The Macedonian people are few in number, but have a deep 
and old culture, and if we look at the history of the Balkans, 
it cannot be disassociated from Macedonia. Moreover, our two 
peoples are closely connected through close blood, religious, 
and historic links. As you know, Russia was christened (it 
accepted Christianity) and became a Christian country through 
the great merit of the Ohrid Exarchate. We know that Kiev 
Russia had strong relations with Ohrid. There are numerous 
other examples in history when the two countries and peoples had 
active cooperation. From that aspect, it is a great honor and 
duty for me to be appointed to Macedonia. I say great duty 
because, unfortunately, the history of the Macedonian people was 
carried on in such a way that many in Macedonia know a lot about 
Russia, but only a few in Russia know about Macedonia. That 
will be one of my basic goals, to get to know that country 
better and to bring the truth about that people to the brotherly 
Russian people. 
  [Adamcevski] You have now touched the next question. What 
other aims will be basic to your activities? 
  [Trushin] I have already mentioned them: The intensification 
of the traditional friendship and cooperation between our two 
peoples. The second goal is to get to know the history and 
culture of that people, to study the present situation, and to 
inform my leadership, my government, my people. One of the most 
important goals of my stay in Macedonia, as a representative of 
the Russian Federation, will be to make our people, our country, 
realize the guarantee of stability and independence of the 
Macedonian people. The policy conducted by Russia in Macedonia 
should contribute to stability and peace in that country. In 
brief, these will be the goals during my stay in Macedonia. 
  [Adamcevski] What is your opinion of the present situation 
in Macedonia within the framework of the Balkans? 
  [Trushin] I think that the policy led by President Kiro 
Gligorov, who enjoys great respect in our country, and this has 
been confirmed during the numerous discussions and meetings I 
have had with my leadership, is the best policy, because his 
policy is directed toward good neighboring relations with the 
neighboring countries. That is an example of how the future 
policy in the Balkans should be, despite the fact that this is 
the time when Macedonia is surrounded by furious passions, wars, 
and interethnic disputes. Thanks to its leadership, thanks to 
the fact that the Macedonians are a very peaceful people, of 
good intentions, it can be said that Macedonia has succeeded in 
being the only states of former Yugoslavia to have avoided those 
events. Here, I think that this policy of peace, good 
neighboring relations, and cooperation with the neighbors, in my 
opinion, is the main orientation in the policy of Macedonia. On 
that plan, Macedonia will always have support from Russia, from 
our government, and leadership. 
  [Adamcevski] Can you tell us about your views on the future 
development of the situation in Macedonia? 
  [Trushin] It is ungrateful to forecast policy. However, the 
way it seems to me, the fact we are now witnessing a broad 
process of recognition of Macedonia by the European countries, 
by the world, proves a full recognition of the peaceful policy 
of Macedonia. My opinion is that the line of international 
recognition of Macedonia, neglecting the known difficulties, 
represents a chance for Macedonian perspectives, for overcoming 
those difficulties, for it becoming a full and equal member of 
the world's community on its road to civilized development. 
  [Adamcevski] What will be your role and the role of the 
Russian Federation in that direction? 
  [Trushin] If we reduce all that to Russian-Macedonian 
relations, I would like to mention that Russia was the first of 
the superpowers to recognize Macedonia. It recognized its 
independence on 4 August last year, by the act of our President 
Boris Yeltsin. Then our Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev paid a 
visit to Macedonia, followed by his deputy Vitaliy Churkin. In 
implementing the act of President Yeltsin, official inter-state 
relations were established between the two countries and 
respective representatives were appointed. My leadership has 
entrusted me with the task of going to the spot and learning 
about the situation in Macedonia, and then I am expected to 
submit adequate proposals to our leadership and government in 
compliance with the development of the situation. 
  [Adamcevski] What is your opinion of the presence of the UN 
forces in Macedonia? 
  [Trushin] Our line in that direction is clear and 
consistent. If those forces contribute to the development of 
stability and the reinforcement of peace in Macedonia, to its 
economic growth and security, we can then welcome such a 
presence. 
  [Adamcevski] However, some Russian media said that Russia 
had abandoned the Balkans, asking about the reason for the 
presence of the Americans there, that is in Macedonia. 
  [Trushin] First of all, we look at the presence of the 
Americans within the framework of the UN forces. On the other 
hand, I think that such an aspect appears as a remnant of the 
ideological concept of the division of the world between the two 
superpowers. Now, we are developing a Russian policy on the 
indispensable Partnership for Peace, for which we meet 
understanding in the Western world. Therefore, any actions, 
Russian, U.S., or some other countries', must contribute to the 
reinforcement of stability, of good neighborliness. The 
ideological remnants must be excluded from these actions, as 
well as the confrontations and the division of the world between 
two systems. That is why we consider that our role, I would 
say, in assisting Macedonia, will mean a continuation in the 
direction followed hitherto. If the U.S. policy leads to 
stability and development in Macedonia, we shall welcome it and 
we shall cooperate with the Americans. 
  [Adamcevski] You know that a great part of the Macedonian 
foreign trade exchange was linked to the USSR, that is Russia. 
What will you do, now that the exchange has been lowered, to 
promote this situation? 
  [Trushin] With the breaking up of the USSR and Yugoslavia, 
the traditional trade relations have been remarkably weakened. 
It does not affect only the former republics of the USSR and 
Yugoslavia, because it is a larger process. Let me note that 
Macedonia was the only one of the former Yugoslav republics that 
imported more than it exported to the USSR. This is a very 
significant detail. Our analyses show that there are 
possibilities for increasing Macedonian exports to Russia. Our 
side is pleased to show great interest in textiles and small 
industry. Our large market is interested in tobacco, in shoes, 
and in many other products bought in Macedonia. There is a 
mutual interest with the Macedonians, too. Now that the economy 
is being restructured, it is very important to start direct 
links and contacts between the respective companies. In that 
framework, I view my mission in Macedonia as a possibility for 
promoting economic cooperation to a higher level. It will be a 
great contribution if Russia helps Macedonia get back on its 
feet. That is extremely valuable. For that purpose it was 
decided, right after my appointment, to also appoint an economic 
counselor to Macedonia. It demonstrates that we have put the 
issue of foreign trade relations in the first place. 
  [Adamcevski] Would you like to add something I have failed 
to ask about? 
  [Trushin] I would like to say that the characteristic of my 
mission is that, compared to representatives and ambassadors 
appointed to, so to say, "worked out" countries, I am starting 
an unusual mission in that aspect. Unfortunately, that was due 
to history itself, therefore there are no experts on the 
Macedonian language, on the Macedonian history, and so on. 
Therefore, in addition to my everyday obligations, I shall be 
also learning the language, the country.... In that 
perspective, my contacts with Macedonian historians, linguists, 
and people of culture, will play a great role for me. On that 
plan, we must use the links among the scientists of the two 
countries, as well as the existing potentials. There are such 
ideas now. When it became clear I was going to Macedonia, I was 
visited by some representatives of the intelligentsia, the mass 
media, some scientists, and they came out with the idea of 
opening a Russian House in Macedonia, which would be the only 
one in the Balkans. Therefore, it would be a Russian House 
accumulating the spiritual wealth of the Russian people, which 
we would generously share with our brothers, the Macedonian 
people. This idea has already been accepted by Macedonia. I 
have already had meetings with your eminent writers and artists. 
The government circles have also accepted it with pleasure and 
approval. It will be the first step in introducing the two 
peoples that have traditional and cultural links. There are 
also other ideas, but this is the first major one, and I, as the 
first representative of the Russian Federation, would like to 
realize it. I think it will also be well accepted by the 
neighboring countries. I think they will have an understanding 
for that, so that we can expand the cooperation. 
  And finally, I would like to wish the Macedonian brotherly 
people success in overcoming the present difficulties and in 
making Macedonia a flourishing state in the family of civilized 
nations.

<H5>  Promptness for Better Mutual Cooperation </H5>
  Yesterday, President of the Republic of Macedonia Kiro 
Gligorov received a protocol visit of the official 
representative of the Russian Federation in our country, Jurij 
Petrovich Trushin. 
  The Russian representative conveyed to President Gligorov 
the 
cordial greetings and new year's wishes of President of the 
Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin and the Russian leadership, 
emphasizing their readiness to promote further relations and 
cooperation with Macedonia in the interest of the two nations 
and countries, for peace and stability in the region. 
  President Gligorov expressed his gratitude and returned the 
greetings and wishes, emphasizing that Macedonia is following 
with great attention and pleasure the efforts of President 
Yeltsin and the Russian leadership to further democracy in 
Russian society and peace in the world. Gligorov also talked 
about the possibilities for, and interest in, an ample 
cooperation in all fields of mutual interest, based on the 
historical links between the two countries and on the democratic 
developments in both countries. 
  President Gligorov welcomed the opening of the Office of the 
Russian Federation in Macedonia and expressed his hopes that it 
would soon grow into an embassy. 
  Discussions were also held on the current issues regarding 
Macedonian-Russian relations, on the situation in both the 
countries, as well as on the situation in the Balkans. This was 
stated by the Cabinet of the president of the Republic of 
Macedonia.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Nikolayev article: "Russia's Peacemaking Role. </F>
What Will It Be?"] 
  [Text] At the Rome session of CSCE Foreign Ministers 
Council, the Russian delegation raised the question of giving a 
legitimate status within the CSCE framework to the peacemaking 
efforts of the Russian Federation and the CIS. While 
recognizing the existence of the real threat to international 
security emanating from the interethnic conflicts which are 
erupting in the former USSR and giving de facto approval to the 
actions of the Russian Federation, the Council of Ministers was 
nevertheless reluctant to give its forces the status of CSCE 
"blue helmets." 
  The Russian side's argument did not meet with understanding 
from a whole series of delegations, first and foremost Ukraine, 
a number of East European countries, Canada, and Norway. At the 
session, the opponents of the legitimation in international law 
of the actions of the Russian Federation's peacemaking forces 
raised the hypothesis of the revival of Russian "neoimperialism" 
and accused Russia of trying in this way to mask its true 
intentions with regard to the new division of the Eurasian 
continent. 
  It goes without saying that Russia, like any great power, 
has 
zones of traditional geopolitical interests and regions to which 
it gives paramount attention. Our approach in this regard is 
dictated not by an imperial ideology but by perfectly 
understandable pragmatic considerations. It is obvious that the 
creation in Russia of a successfully functioning market economy 
mechanism is impossible without ensuring that market's normal 
interaction. Russia's prime interest is in a normalization of 
the situation in the neighboring former Union republics not only 
in a military sense but also economically. It was 
considerations such as those which has motivated Russia's 
diplomatic efforts in New York, Rome, Brussels, and at other 
international forums where it formulated practical steps on 
peacemaking questions. 
  The charges of neoimperialism are groundless even if only 
because Moscow, by bearing on its shoulders the full burden of 
peacemaking in the post-Soviet area, is certainly not seeking to 
operate in isolation. On the contrary, collective actions are 
no less necessary in Nagorno-Karabakh, for example, than they 
are in Yugoslavia. Russia operates in the "hot spots" not only 
in its own interests but also in the interests of the whole 
world community. That was confirmed at the 48th UN General 
Assembly [UNGA] session and formed the main theme of the 
decisions of the CSCE Foreign Ministers' Council. 
  It is obvious now that there are no alternatives to 
increasing and strengthening Russia's peacemaking efforts in the 
area of the former USSR. For Russia, the question is not 
whether to engage in those activities or not. The question is 
how to make those efforts more effective by utilizing UN 
experience in regional conflicts and elaborating joint positions 
with the CSCE. Incidentally, the latter need was tacitly 
recognized by the participants in the Rome forum when they 
acknowledged the CSCE's failure to convene a peace conference on 
Nagorno-Karabakh. 
  Russia's peacemaking forces can offer evidence of the 
considerable, albeit not absolute, success of its actions in the 
Dniester region, Tajikistan, Ingushetia, and other regions. The 
creation and strengthening of Russia's peacemaking structures is 
being effected with the participation of the supreme councils of 
the CIS member countries. Incidentally, the CIS countries' 
joint peacemaking actions are carried out both on the basis of 
bilateral and multilateral interim accords and of the recently 
adopted "Agreement on the Groups of Military Observers and 
Collective Forces for the Maintenance of Peace in the CIS." 
  Our peacemaking efforts also have an enormous 
"humanitarian" advantage. Russians know best the specifics of 
the political situation, are able to understand the genesis and 
dynamics of a conflict, and are ready to effectively promote the 
long-term stabilization of the situation. 
  Russia, furthermore, is acquiring its own unique 
"fire-fighting" experience. For example, as distinct from the 
existing rules of the CSCE, it is becoming the practice here to 
enlist the opposing sides' forces in operations, and for our 
armed contingents to use military force, although it must be 
said not for the purpose of crushing the opposing sides in a 
conflict but for self-defense. 
  This of course does not mean that Moscow is trying in some 
way to crowd out potential foreign peacemakers. On the 
contrary, the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry memorandum on 
enhancing the CSCE's effectiveness in the peacemaking sphere 
proposes preparing and concluding a treaty on the principles of 
planning and implementing the kind of operations which would 
envisage the formation of a joint paramilitary rapid reaction 
corps and would create a common material base for operations. 
  While expressing full gratitude to the CSCE observers 
working 
in the conflict zones in Ossetia, the Dniester region, and 
Abkhazia it has to be acknowledged that the existing CSCE 
structures, geared as they are to the prevention of conflicts 
and the maintenance of peace by means of preventive diplomacy, 
cannot always give an adequate and rapid response to the 
challenges of the present day. The search for the optimum 
combination of the efforts of the CSCE and Russia, the 
elaboration of the status of operations, and giving material 
expression to that status will all take considerable time. 
Unfortunately, that is what we do not have. That is why at the 
48th UNGA Session and the Rome session Moscow's delegation 
raised with particular persistence the question of giving 
priority to easing the financial burden which the Russian 
Federation is bearing in connection with the implementation of 
peacemaking actions. 
  Clearly it has to be realized that in the specific 
post-Soviet area purely Russian peacemaking actions cannot be 
replaced by international financial support, no matter how 
extensive it may be, or by the participation of any group of 
countries in them. That view, it seems, is meeting with a 
certain understanding among the leading Western countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Leonid Mlechin: "Azerbaijanis Attack All Along </F>
the Front with the Aid of the Mojahedin and Put Moscow in a 
Difficult Position"] 
  [Text] Almost immediately after the New Year Russian 
diplomats will resume their peacemaking efforts in 
Nagorno-Karabakh, without particular hope of success, it is true. 
  For several days now the Azerbaijani troops have been 
attacking all along the Karabakh front line. In the north they 
have managed to advance some way. Both sides are suffering 
heavy losses. 
  The Azerbaijan army needs if not a real military success 
then 
at least the semblance of success. It is not clear what the 
ultimate goal is -- to reinforce their positions at the talks or 
on the contrary to wreck these talks? 
  The Russian diplomats are saddened by Baku's decision to 
start an offensive. The signing of the latest cease-fire 
agreement has been thwarted. All details had been agreed 
verbally but at the last moment the Azerbaijanis refused to sign 
the document. 
  It may be expected that in the very near future the Karabakh 
Armenians will try to seize the initiative and switch to a 
counteroffensive as a result of which some part of Azerbaijani 
territory will again be occupied. That will worsen the 
prospects of attaining peace. 
  Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian president's special 
representative, is again setting off for Baku, Yerevan, and 
Stepanakert. It has been decided to turn the page on the 
incident of the Armenian soldiers' shooting of his automobile in 
the Nagorno-Karabakh region. During the talk in Ashgabat 
between Boris Yeltsin and Armenian President Levon 
Ter-Petrosyan, the Russian president, we have found out, "talked 
through gritted teeth" and something in the nature of an apology 
was made. At any rate Minister Kozyrev has decided to interpret 
Ter-Petrosyan's words as an apology. 
  The Russian diplomats will insist that the leaders of the 
opposing sides come to Moscow -- here, outside the meetings 
environment, they are usually easier to convince. 
  Meanwhile the situation is obviously deteriorating. Only a 
month ago Academician Primakov, director of the Foreign 
Intelligence Service, was speaking of the activation of the 
Afghan mojahedin in this war. But he noted at the time that the 
reports at the intelligence service's disposal "attest to 
intentions more than to facts of participation right now." 
According to recent information from Moscow experts, 1,500 
Afghan mojahedin are taking part in the war on the Azerbaijan 
army's side and there will soon be more. 
  The Armenians also suspect that Turkey is taking part in the 
conflict. In early December IZVESTIYA's Yerevan correspondent, 
Sergey Bablumyan, reported that the Dashnaktsutyun party 
analytical center, citing the French special services, was 
warning that in mid-December Turkey was preparing a missile 
strike against Armenia's energy centers. The pretext was the 
presence on Armenian territory of bases of the Kurdish Workers 
Party, which is struggling against Turkey and Turks throughout 
the world. 
  The Dashnaktsutyun party's statement is most likely 
propaganda. Any military action against Armenia would put into 
operation the treaty on the CIS countries' collective security; 
that is it would pit Turkey against Russia. Turkish servicemen 
take no part in combat operations on the "Karabakh front," 
although it is known that they are engaging in the Azerbaijan 
army's combat training. Since Azerbaijan's accession to the CIS 
countries' collective security treaty, the appearance of foreign 
servicemen on its territory looks quite dubious. 
  As for the bases of the Kurdish rebels, the Russian Foreign 
Ministry knows only that this information has appeared in the 
Turkish newspapers, which of itself is not proof. 
Representatives of the Russian intelligence service unofficially 
doubt there are such bases, but officially they cite the absence 
of a mandate allowing them to work on the territory of the CIS 
countries. 
  The ally relations of the North American and West European 
countries within NATO do not prevent them -- thoroughly and 
while observing the proprieties -- from spying on each other. 
It would be logical to give Russian intelligence similar 
powers. The political and military leadership in Moscow is 
quite obviously in need of information, including that obtained 
promptly. And the intelligence assessments of the situation in 
republics neighboring on Russia should be made public in the 
most general form. The taxpayers have the right to know what is 
happening around Russia and to have the opportunity to judge 
competently how far Moscow's peacemaking efforts accord with the 
gravity of the situation in the conflict zone.

<F P=106> [Aleksandr Khokhlov report: "What Moscow Thinks About This"] </F>
  [Text] We asked Admiral Igor Kasatonov, first deputy 
commander in chief of the Russian Navy, to comment on the latest 
events concerning the Black Sea Fleet's property. 
  "Unfortunately, neither the strategy nor the tactics of the 
Ukrainian military leadership are changing. Russia is being 
systematically squeezed from the Black Sea region. Now Kiev has 
waited for the Ashgabat agreements to be adopted and `gone on 
the attack' on engineering establishments of the Black Sea Fleet. 
  "This action itself had no significance -- either militarily 
or politically. The installations would have been voluntarily 
transferred to Ukraine by the Black Sea Fleet in January 1994. 
Someone in the Ukrainian military evidently wanted to assert 
his own personal importance and to prove his 'devotion' to the 
republic's political leadership. 
  "Russian sailors have no intention of `taking' their 
installations back from the Ukrainian military. Let them use 
them. But I believe that these will `count against' Ukraine 
when the new documents on the Black Sea Fleet are signed."

  [Text] Russia's Foreign Ministry is not inclined to "take 
seriously" numerous statements by the leader of Lithuania's 
parliamentary opposition, Vytautas Landsbergis. To argue with 
him is as pointless as with the leader of the Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. This is how a 
high-ranking Russian diplomat dealing with Baltic problems 
commented on Landsbergis's recent statements concerning 
relations with Russia. 
  Addressing a news conference in Vilnius recently, 
Landsbergis 
criticized the present Lithuanian leadership for its "policy of 
rapprochement with the East". According to him, the "aggressive 
nationalism of Russia, whose policy had been identical to that 
of Zhirinovskiy who only speaks more openly, revealed itself in 
full lately". 
  "Such escapades on the part of Landsbergis no longer 
surprise 
anyone," said Interfax's interviewee. "They have become so 
biased and subjective, that they can hardly be taken seriously 
even in Lithuania itself," he noted. 
  The interview with the Russian diplomat will be published in 
more detail in tomorrow's edition of Diplomatic Panorama.

  [Text] Our commentator, Lidiya Padulina, suggests that we 
should touch upon a theme which is very topical at the present 
time -- relations between Russia and the Baltic countries. 
  [Padulina] It is not a secret that Russian-Baltic dialogue 
is 
difficult. This is how ambassador (Vasiliy Svirin), the head of 
the Russian delegation, estimates negotiations with Estonia. 
  [Begin (Svirin) recording] It is difficult for me to speak 
about the prospects of the negotiating process in 1994 because I 
am a head of the state delegation of Russia at the negotiations 
with the Republic of Estonia. The fact is that recently the 
Estonian side has been aiming to protract the negotiating 
process. Thus, a question is arising whether the Estonian 
delegation is going to stop the negotiations. We have the basis 
for such thoughts. On 17 November the Russian delegation made a 
proposal to hold the next round of negotiations in Moscow in the 
middle of December 1993. December is over but we have no answer 
despite our reminders. Thus, at the Russian-Estonian 
negotiations we have the same situation as at sport 
competitions: The ball is in the court of the Estonian team; we 
are waiting for its response. [end recording] 
  [Padulina] There is no such tension with Latvia as with 
Estonia. But there are the same issues at the agenda of 
negotiations. Ambassador (Aleksey Zotov) comments on them. 
  [Begin (Zotov) recording] The state delegation of Russia 
believes that the main issues of the negotiating process with 
Latvia are to complete the coordination of all documents which 
will determine the legal basis for the withdrawal of Russian 
troops. And the second series of problems is connected with the 
protection of rights of the Russian-speaking population. The 
Latvian leadership did not want to speak about this at our 
negotiations. They explained this by the fact that they did not 
have a law on the citizenship. Now this law has been introduced 
and is under discussion. We would like to hope that the fate of 
more than 1,000,000 Russian-speaking people who are permanent 
residents in this country will be decided according to the 
standards which Latvia has undertaken to respect when it joined 
the United Nations and the Conference of Security and 
Cooperation in Europe. [end recording] 
  [Padulina] As far as the most difficult question -- the 
withdrawal of Russian troops -- is concerned, we managed to 
reach agreement with Lithuania on this issue. Ambassador 
(Viktor Isakov) comments on the priorities in the 
Russian-Lithuanian relations now. 
  [Begin (Isakov) recording] I think that the negotiating 
process with the Lithuanian republic is going on normally. We 
have reached certain results. However, despite the signing of a 
trade and economic agreement with the Lithuanian Republic and an 
agreement on vehicle transport, our citizens and our 
organizations still have some difficulties in Kaliningrad when 
they cross Lithuanian territory. Because of this, the main 
problem will be to elaborate and sign an agreement on mutual 
visits and an agreement on transit which would replace 
provisional rules which exist now. We hope that the 
negotiations will be resumed in the near future. [end 
recording] 
  [Padulina] I spoke with these three Russian diplomats on 
telephone and asked them the same question: What do you expect 
in the new year? And I received rather different answers. As a 
whole they reflect the difficulties in relations between Russian 
and the Baltic countries. But all the same, I believe that the 
main reason is the accumulated estrangement and mistrust toward 
each other. Will we be able to have normal inter-governmental 
relations? In spite of everything the new year gives us such 
hopes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jean Foglizzo, head of the IMF permanent </F>
mission in Russia, by unidentified ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
correspondent; place and date not given: "The IMF Does Not Have 
any `Magic Figures'"] 
  [Excerpts] The IMF is not setting our country any 
conditions, it is merely demanding firm guarantees that the 
credits granted will be repaid. [passage omitted] 
  [Foglizzo] We help those countries which are experiencing 
difficulties in the sphere of foreign payments. On condition, 
of course, that their policy does not harm other states. Our 
job is to use money to the maximum advantage and enable a 
country to implement economic reforms on the one hand while, on 
the other hand, ensuring the repayment of the debt so that our 
depositors do not suffer a loss and have an opportunity to 
promptly invest their repaid resources in the economies of 
countries that need investment. This is the IMF's philosophy, 
these are the functions assigned to it by the world community. 
  We are adopting the same approach toward Russia. We need 
firm guarantees that the reforms here will continue to develop. 
The government's program designed to run through the end of 
1994 is now being implemented. It has been approved by the 
Council of Ministers Presidium and the prime minister. But how 
can we rely on that program when a detailed budget for next year 
has still not been prepared even now, at the end of December? 
In this case it is not a question of a tough stance by the IMF 
toward Russia but a desire to build our partnership on firmer 
foundations. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] What credits has Russia already received 
from the IMF? 
  [Foglizzo] An accord was signed 5 August 1992, granting 
Russia a so-called reserve credit of $1 billion. This is the 
main form of credit which the IMF issues to its members for the 
support of economic programs. It was received in full by your 
country by December 1992. During this year Russia has received 
a further $1.5 billion from the IMF. This is aid within the 
framework of the recently created program of finance for 
systemic transformations. It envisages the granting of credits 
to those countries which are switching to a market economy. The 
maximum credit of this type is $3 billion. When the IMF granted 
Russia the first 1.5 billion, we expected that it would receive 
the remaining 1.5 billion by October or November -- but that 
did not happen. In August the government was unable to adhere 
to the course of reforms agreed with and supported by us. There 
were many reasons for that. The main reason was the conflict 
between the president and the parliament which led to a 
destabilization of the situation. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Now this main reason has been removed. 
Does this mean that our country will soon receive the second 
part of the systemic credit? 
  [Foglizzo] That depends on the subsequent development of 
events. A program of urgent measures was elaborated this fall, 
designed to achieve financial stabilization. We approve it 
although perhaps not all of its details. Now the problem is to 
convince the other branches of power and the Russian people that 
there can be no solution to the crisis without such measures. 
  As I have already said, this year the government was unable 
to fully maintain the course of financial stabilization. Now 
the time has come to think about an action program for next 
year. I do not know what kind of program it will be. The IMF 
has no "magic figures" -- no universal budget deficit or 
inflation rate ceilings. The main point is that there must be a 
firm and unwavering desire for reforms, stabilization of the 
economy, and radical reduction of the rate of inflation. 
[passage omitted] 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Is the IMF currently holding talks 
with the Russian Government on further cooperation? 
  [Foglizzo] An IMF mission visited Moscow in the first half 
of December. Our specialists would like to come here again as 
soon as possible. But I do not think that there will be any 
serious negotiations until the question of the new parliament is 
finally resolved and the composition of the Russian Government 
is confirmed. We can hardly construct real plans for next year 
before 15 January. 
  U.S. President Clinton is due to arrive in Moscow soon. He 
will have talks with President Yeltsin. IMF Executive Director 
M. Camdessus has also been invited to Moscow. The IMF's 
subsequent activity in your country will depend on the results 
of this top-level meeting. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Clearly, work in Russia has brought the 
IMF more problems than it anticipated? 
  [Foglizzo] No, we are cooperating quite well with Russia. 
Of course this does not mean that all our efforts have been 
successful. But during this year we have come to understand the 
country better and have learned how various traditional 
mechanisms influence the economy. In your government we have 
found people who really understand the situation, who know what 
must be done, and who know how to explain the decisions that are 
made in a way that is accessible to the population. First and 
foremost this applies to Vice Premier and Finance Minister Boris 
Fedorov. 
  I think that Russia has changed enormously in the past year. 
Even the actual standard of the debates on economic questions is 
far higher now than it used to be. The privatization process is 
making quite successful and rapid progress. We are glad that 
the currency market has operated without interruption and that 
the rate of the ruble there has stabilized in the past six 
months. Markets in vouchers and other securities have been 
formed. This is an important factor for stabilization. 
  The structural reorganization of industry has begun. This, 
after all, is the key to a successful economic reform. 
Production is beginning to respond more flexibly to changes in 
the situation in the market. 
  New relations are developing between the government and the 
Central Bank. In May-June the IMF supported the agreement 
between them. Without that accord we could not have allocated 
the first $1.5 billion systemic credit to Russia. Our experts 
working at the Central Bank believe that in recent months 
relations between it and the government have improved somewhat. 
The Central Bank nevertheless does want to adapt, albeit 
cautiously at the moment, to the new market conditions. For 
example, the interest rate is currently 210 percent a year or 
17.5 percent a month whereas inflation in September-November was 
15 to 17 percent. This means that a positive interest rate has 
appeared in Russia for the first time. 
  There are also some alarming tendencies. For example, the 
raising of customs import duties. It is our hope that this is 
the exception rather than the beginning of a lengthy process. 
On the whole I believe that this year's balance has been 
positive -- inflation has fallen and the slump in production is 
slowing down even if it has not actually stopped. Thus there 
are grounds for optimism. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [New Year's Message by Georgian State Council Chairman </F>
Eduard Shevardnadze -- recorded] 
  [Text] In connection with the incoming new year of 1994 I 
would like to speak about the threats and dangers, which have in 
effect been hampering and opposing the formation of true 
independence and the establishment of democratic states. First, 
there is the economic recession and economic collapse. Given 
mutual support it will be possible to achieve the restoration of 
the old economic links and the establishment of new ones. Given 
mutual support and mutual solidarity and active help from the 
West it will be possible to make 1994 the beginning of economic 
recovery, the revival of all our economic life and on that basis 
an improvement in social conditions for each citizen of our 
countries. 
  Second, I have in the past had occasion to say that after 
the 
end of the cold war and the disintegration of the Soviet Union 
aggressive and bellicose separatism would become the main threat 
to peace and stability in various parts of the globe. We have 
experienced for ourselves what separatism means. It means 
thousands of people killed and shot dead and hundreds thousands 
of refugees. It means genocide and ethnic cleansing in actual 
reality. It seems to me that in 1994 we shall be able to 
achieve a real breakthrough in the fight against this evil and 
establish peace and stability in our countries. 
  Third, in recent years much has been said about the threat 
of 
approaching dictatorship and the revival of fascism. In 
Ashgabat it seemed to me that we have now realized the whole 
stern reality of the reconstruction of fascism, the spread of 
fascism. Once we have realized this I am confident that we 
shall beat fascism and beat this 20th Century plague. It seems 
to me that 1994 will be a crucial year in the fight against 
fascism. 
  Success in these three areas will bring peace and prosperity 
to each family within our independent and free states. I wish 
you happiness and prosperity. Thank you.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tengiz Pachkoria] </F>
  [Text] Tbilisi January 1 TASS -- Chairman of the Georgian 
Parliament Eduard Shevardnadze gave an interview to the 
republican TV and radio on the occasion of the new year. 
Assessing the situation in 1993, the Georgian leader mentioned 
both the negative and positive results of the economic and 
political development of the republic. Positive results include 
the end of the civil war in Georgia and the joining of the CIS. 
Shevardnadze described the joining of the new Commonwealth as 
one of the most significant events in the life of the republic. 
Speaking about negative results, he mentioned the tragedy in 
Abkhazia, the temporary loss of control and jurisdiction over 
some other cities and districts of Abkhazia, too hasty putting 
in circulation of the Georgian coupon on the territory of the 
republic and the deterioraton of the crime situation. 
  According to Shevardnadze, 1994 should become a year of the 
improvement of the economic situation in Georgia and the CIS in 
general, whose leaders understand full well that they can 
resolve the acute economic and other problems only by joint 
efforts. Shevardnadze is pinning much hope on the restoration of 
economic relations with the former USSR republics and on the 
establishment of new economic, political and other relations 
with the CIS member states. He said in his new year interview 
that 1994 should witness the end on the basis of justice of the 
conflict in Abkhazia, which, in his opinion, is guaranteed by 
the active work of international organisations, the CSCE, and 
the positive role played by Russia and other countries, which 
are friendly to Georgia, specifically, the U.S., Germany and so 
on. He expressed confidence that hundreds of thousands of 
refugees from Abkhazia, who are now living in other regions of 
the republic, in Russia and other CIS member states, will be 
able to return home. 
  He pointed out that 1994 would witness the adoption of a new 
Georgian constitution. If the new constitution is adopted this 
year, then parliamentary elections will probably be held in 1994 
too. Naturally, he did not mention the date of the elections.

  [Text] The Georgian head of state has issued an edict on 
securing order at oil-prospecting areas on the territory of the 
Republic of Georgia. 
  As from the beginning of 1994, oil prospecting, which will 
contribute to bringing the country out of the energy crisis, is 
planned to be carried out with the participation of foreign 
firms in the territory of the Republic of Georgia. In order to 
secure order at geological survey sites at the oil fields: 
  1. Full responsibility for the security of people engaged in 
work at the oil fields and the establishment of order in the 
corresponding areas will be given to the Georgian Ministry of 
Internal Affairs. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and the 
state Georgian Petroleum will sign an appropriate agreement and 
create proper conditions for police sub-units to carry out the 
assignment. 
  2. The Ministry of Internal Affairs will prevent any 
attempts 
by armed formations to obstruct establishment of proper order at 
oil- prospecting sites and refining installations. 
  3. The Georgian Ministry of Justice and the Procurator's 
Office will examine the state of the management of security at 
the installations and submit propositions about appropriate 
amendments to be introduced in the legislation to the Georgian 
parliament and the Georgian head of state.

<F P=106> [Decree issued by Georgian head of state Eduard </F>
Shevardnadze; place and date not given: "Georgian Head of 
State's Decree on Boosting Production of Small-Size Power 
Engineering Projects"] 
  [Text] The situation in the fuel and power complex of the 
Republic of Georgia being critical, large-scale development of 
small-size fuel and power engineering projects like small 
hydroelectric power stations, mini-works for processing coal and 
elements of its concentration, installations of non-traditional 
[word indistinct], and so on becomes particularly urgent because 
these require comparatively small investments, secure quick 
returns and, along with other measures, contribute to a quicker 
breakthrough in the energy crisis. 
  A number of interesting developments of this sort have been 
drawn up in the republic. However, so far, their implementation 
has proved to be impossible. In addition, no appropriate legal 
mechanisms have been created by legislative and government 
enforceable enactments, that will promote and encourage private 
capital and foreign investments, allotment of specific state 
credits for speeding up the creation of small power engineering 
installations, proper and timely reaction to propositions put 
forward by foreign investors, and so on. 
  In order to secure a rapid and large-scale development of 
the 
fuel and power projects: 
  1. The Georgian Cabinet of Ministers, together with the 
Georgian National Bank, will promptly scrutinize a project drawn 
up jointly by the U.S. Association of Resource Funds and the 
Georgian Association for Small-Size Power Engineering, 
stipulating the allotment of a long-term credit of (?20) billion 
U.S. dollars for the construction of about 200 small 
hydroelectric stations and will submit a motion enforced with 
appropriate guarantees. 
  2. Following propositions of the Georgian Academy of 
Sciences, the Georgian Mining Society and the Georgian 
Association for Small- Size Power Engineering will be approved: 
  (a) To manufacture fuel briquettes from coal, concentration 
material wastes and slag, and also to equip industry with works 
producing boilers and other heating devices for housing and 
public utilities that will use coal as fuel. 
  (b) To establish two small (?hydroelectric stations) at a 
Zhinvali [near Tbilisi] hydropower station reservoir and a 
buffer reservoir at Hudoni [western Georgia] that will secure 
the implementation of the program on the utilization of 
hydropower resources. 
  In response to this, the Georgian National Bank will provide 
the Georgian Association of Small-Size Power Engineering and 
affiliated specialized firms with credits of 3.5 billion coupons 
in 1994 for the period of three years, with an annual interest 
rate of 2 percent for the production of coal fuel briquettes and 
furnishing of industry for the production of heating devices and 
installations; 18 billion coupons for the construction of 
mini-hydroelectric stations, 2 billion of the total sum for 
1993, and 16 billion coupons for 1994 for a period of four years 
with the rate of four percent. 
  3. Georgian state departments Saknakhshiri [coal], Sakgazi 
[gas], Saknavtobi [petroleum], and the Georgian State Concern 
Navtobproduktebi [Petroleum products] will render assistance for 
the development of a proper material and technical basis for 
[word indistinct]. 
  4. The Georgian Ministries of Industry, Agriculture, and 
Foodstuffs Production, Trade, and Supply, as well as the State 
Committee of Air Transport and the Department of Highway 
Transport will render assistance to the Georgian Association of 
Small-Size Power Engineering and its affiliated firms in 
carrying out barter operations for importing small-size [word 
indistinct] and equipment to be mounted in them. 
  5. The Georgian Cabinet of Ministers, together with the 
Georgian National Bank, will stipulate the provision of 
long-term privileged credits for the development of small-size 
power engineering in 1994 and the following years, and establish 
a permanent control over the management of the funds. 
  6. The Georgian Cabinet of Ministers, along with the 
appropriate ministries and government agencies will, in two 
months time, draw up and submit for approval a draft legislative 
and other juridical and legal enactments, the implementation of 
which would promote the development of small-size power 
engineering in the republic.

  [Text] Tbilisi, 3 Jan -- IBERIA reports that in his address 
on Gudauta radio, Vladislav Ardzinba, leader of the Abkhaz 
separatists, said that he is skeptical about Georgian-Abkhaz 
consultations which are to be held in Moscow on 11 January. 
  "In Tbilisi, they do not want to reconcile themselves to the 
idea that Abkhazia will no longer be a part of Georgia. 
Abkhazia has won the war. And conditions are set by the 
winners not by the losers. It is only possible to talk about a 
treaty being signed by Abkhazia and Georgia as equal entities. 
Such a treaty will not in any way limit Abkhazia's sovereignty, 
since we are also planning to sign similar treaties with Russia 
and other neighboring countries. 
  "As for the return of the refugees, I believe that the 
Georgian side is using this issue for speculative aims. We 
prevent no one from returning home. However, many of those who 
are on the run do not have a clear conscience. They know well 
that nobody will forgive them their collaboration with the 
occupation army. Those who met Georgian troops with open arms 
will not be able to live in Abkhazia", Vladislav Ardzinba said.

  [Text] According to CONTACT INFORMATION AGENCY, Tengiz 
Sharmanishvili, deputy chairman of the Committee for Interethnic 
Relations and Human Rights, sent a letter to the Georgian 
Foreign Ministry. 
  The letter says: Russian news sources have recently 
circulated news of the Russian Government's decision to lift the 
economic sanctions imposed on Abkhazia. As of now, Abkhazia's 
towns and villages are receiving electricity without hindrance. 
  The Abkhaz committee for human rights and interethnic 
relations states that the Abkhaz side has several times breached 
the clauses of the Geneva memorandum on mutual understanding 
signed by Georgia and Abkhazia; it has not stopped combat 
actions against Georgians in the Kodori gorge, is settling 
scores atrociously with the peaceful Georgian population in the 
Gali rayon, and is not taking any measures for finding those 
missing and reburying the killed; it is doing virtually nothing 
for the return of those evicted from their own land. 
  The Russian Government's new year gift is nothing less than 
a 
breach of Resolution No. 876 of the UN Security Council and 
casts doubt on the implementation of the Geneva memorandum on 
mutual understanding.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Denis Perkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 24 Dec [date as received] -- "Russia can and 
must resolve the problem of settling the Georgian-Abkhaz 
conflict," thinks Sandro Kavsadze, chairman of the Georgian 
State Committee for Human Rights and International Relations. 
He made the statement at a news conference on preparations for 
the second round of the Geneva talks on the settlement of the 
Georgian-Abkhazian conflict scheduled for 11 January 1994. 
  "Our main aim is to settle the conflict by peaceful means. 
One cannot wait any longer because killings and deportation of 
people are still going on," Sandro Kavsadze stressed. 
  Summing up some results of the first round of the Geneva 
talks which were held at the end of November and beginning of 
December, he appreciated Russia's assistance in holding the 
talks. Among the results was the memorandum on Mutual 
understanding which included an obligation by the parties to 
refrain from using force for the period of the negotiations, an 
exchange of POW's based on the principle of "everyone in 
exchange of everyone," and measures for resolving the refugee 
problem. The talks also covered the necessity for Abkhazia's 
economic revival and recognition of its autonomous statehood by 
the parties. As regards the second point, the Georgian 
spokesman clarified that "Abkhazia should have an autonomous 
statehood, but the question is what statehood." 
  As for Russia's role in the conflict settlement, Sandro 
Kavsadze thinks the involvement of Russian armed forces under 
the aegis of the United Nations is necessary in order to create 
guarantees for security in the region. The Georgian spokesman 
stressed: "We are trying to convince Russia that there is no 
alternative."

<F P=106> [Interview with Borys Tarasyuk, deputy foreign minister and </F>
chairman of the National Disarmament Committee, by correspondent 
Mykola Marynenko; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Marynenko] [Words indistinct] deactivation of 
SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The situation 
alerted both people here in Ukraine and experts abroad, people 
everywhere. National-minded Ukrainian patriots asserted that 
Ukraine is finally stripping in front of Washington and Moscow. 
People abroad also reacted by shrugging their shoulders: Why 
did Ukraine start with the most modern nuclear missiles, and why 
do it when the well-known SS-19 missiles pose a greater 
environmental danger than the SS-24's? As you see, people 
everywhere, in Ukraine and abroad, are asking why. Would you 
try answering these questions? 
  [Tarasyuk] Thank you. Indeed there are many questions, and 
I will try to explain. In my opinion, it is in Ukraine's 
interests to convince our partners and friends that nuclear arms 
deployed on the Ukrainian territory -- operationally controlled 
from outside Ukraine, by the way -- cannot be used against them. 
  Proceeding from this, and also taking account of the 
Ukrainian Supreme Council's instructions on the need to ensure 
effective technical control over the nonuse of nuclear arms 
deployed on Ukrainian territory, our state's government is 
working on the so-called deactivation of strategic missile 
systems. Deactivation applies first and foremost to missile 
systems or nuclear warhead-carrying systems whose service life 
under guarantee is about to expire. The essence of deactivation 
is removing warheads, storing them in Ukraine at a significant 
distance from missile systems, and also essentially reducing the 
combat readiness of these systems. 
  I should add that it is not only SS-24 missiles -- which are 
more sophisticated, as you correctly pointed out -- that are 
subject to deactivation, but the SS-19 missile systems as well. 
This work is being carried out concurrently. This especially 
concerns SS-19 missiles, whose condition will soon pose a 
serious threat to Ukraine itself, and which we cannot service 
without Russia's help. 
  These measures are being taken to reduce the nuclear and 
environmental danger, and also to show the world community that 
Ukraine has no plans whatsoever to resort to nuclear blackmail 
in relation to any country, and that it is eager to reduce 
nuclear confrontation and increase confidence-building measures. 
  Finally, I would like to stress that these steps are not 
identical with the process of reduction in compliance with the 
START-I Treaty. Meanwhile, intensive talks are being held with 
a number of states, primarily nuclear states, with the aim of 
creating preconditions for the treaty to come into force. 
  [Marynenko] Thank you. One more thing in connection with 
the above problem. Credible sources have disclosed that there 
are plans to deactivate three more SS-24 missiles before the end 
of the year. Can you please deny or confirm this. 
  [Tarasyuk] I will neither deny nor confirm this report. I 
have provided information which confirms the grounds for this 
work to be carried out. As for how many missile systems have 
been deactivated to date, and how many will be deactivated 
tomorrow, that much I am not prepared to tell you. 
  [Marynenko] One more thing. You are probably familiar with 
the speech by people's deputy Mykola Porovskyy at the Supreme 
Council. This deputy linked the deactivation of SS-24 missiles 
with the fact that servicemen of the 43d Army failed to swear 
loyalty to Ukraine. Does this mean that it is a free-for-all? 
  [Tarasyuk] I would like to stress once again that the 
decision to deactivate missile systems was made in Ukraine, 
irrespective of the men servicing missile systems, the 
servicemen of the 43d Missile Unit. Therefore, I do not think 
there is any ground for concern about this. 
  [Marynenko] Is the deactivation of SS-24 missiles a direct 
result of the ratification of the START-I treaty by Ukraine's 
parliament? 
  [Tarasyuk] It is not a result, but a temporary measure taken 
to remove the concern existing in the world, first of all in the 
United States, over a threat facing its territory. Naturally, 
it is not a one-sided process. By carrying out the deactivation 
-- I stress this yet again -- we are not taking any measures 
related to the compliance with the START treaty because these 
processes are in no way equivalent. However, by so doing we are 
reducing nuclear confrontation, the combat readiness of these 
nuclear systems is being curtailed, and we are thus making it 
clear that we have no aggressive intentions whatsoever and, 
moreover, we do not control these missile systems. 
  Thus, we are sending yet another signal of Ukraine's 
peace-loving attitude and, in addition to this, proclaiming 
that, by following this path, we are defusing additional tension 
caused by keeping these missile systems on alert, since they 
consume a very large amount of electric power. I think this is 
another point for our state to consider today. 
  [Marynenko] Mr. Tarasyuk, you know that following Ukraine's 
early start in deactivating strategic missiles, there have been 
new attempts to put pressure on Ukraine. What has been done is 
not enough, it was said, all types of missiles must be 
deactivated, and this must be done overnight, immediately, with 
complete elimination. You know very well that such insinuations 
have been made. And again, for some reason, nobody is taking 
account of either our capability or our interests. Your 
comments, please. 
  [Tarasyuk] I will not comment on this. If you mean 
official reports, I know of no reports of any state demanding 
immediate deactivation. There is nothing like that. This 
process cannot be carried out overnight; it requires time, and 
it also requires certain material and human input. 
  As for the compensation for this process, as you know, a 
framework agreement was signed recently between the United 
States and Ukraine, which will make it possible, as soon as it 
takes effect, to start the process of using the first part of 
the money allocated for the nuclear arms elimination in 
accordance with the Nunn-Lugar provision -- that is, $175 
billion. 
  [Marynenko] Mr. Tarasyuk, I am sure you know about the U.S. 
Senate resolution concerning ratification of the START-I Treaty. 
As a diplomat you know that the treaty has more depth and 
foresight. Although it stresses the mandatory status of Article 
5 of the Lisbon Protocol, it allows for the possibility of delay 
in eliminating nuclear arms. But once Ukraine ratified START-I, 
they start saying the elimination has to be immediate. Your 
opinion, please. 
  [Tarasyuk] I assume you mean the U.S. Senate resolution 
concerning the START Treaty. Indeed, it is a sizeable document 
containing many provisions, including provisions under which the 
United States ratified the treaty and the Lisbon Protocol in 
full. 
  As for the ratification of this treaty by the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council, everybody knows that this ratification will 
come into force provided certain conditions are met. I will 
mention three of the major conditions: financial aid for the 
process of nuclear arms elimination; reliable guarantees of 
Ukraine's national security on the part of nuclear states; and 
third, compensation for not only strategic nuclear warheads but 
also nuclear warheads in the tactical nuclear weapons withdrawn 
from Ukraine as far back as last year. 
  The government is now working on this very issue so as to 
create conditions which would allow the Supreme Council to 
remove its objections concerning the force of this ratification, 
and to exchange instruments of ratification; only then will the 
treaty take effect. From that time on, Ukraine will assume the 
obligations which, of course, it must abide by. 
  [Marynenko] Esteemed Borys Tarasyuk, after the 
disintegration of the Soviet Union, as you well know, Russia 
became the new partner for the United States in Eastern Europe. 
International observers realize -- of course, as a diplomat you 
also realize -- that backing just one partner is no policy; it 
constitutes unbalanced tactics in international terms. These 
tactics can lead to complicated consequences. Still, one can 
understand the old U.S. tradition of backing the strongest 
partner. But for some reason, the United States to this day 
does not wish to see Ukraine as an important factor of the 
European process, as an extremely important international 
security zone, owing to Ukraine's special position in Eastern 
Europe. Do you think this current foreign policy of the U.S. 
Administration with regard to Ukraine is rather blindsighted? 
  [Tarasyuk] You have touched upon a very serious issue. 
Regarding our attitude to relations between the United States 
and Russia, we cannot, of course, be either pleased or 
displeased. The relationship between the United States and 
Russia is their affair. We should not give our appraisal of 
these relations. At the same time, you are right to say that we 
should not put up with the tendency to view relations with 
Ukraine through the prism of relations with Russia, as used to 
be the case and sometimes still is. That should indeed concern 
us, and we have voiced this concern to our partners more than 
once. 
  I do not think we can now say that the United States does 
not 
regard Ukraine as a partner. In my opinion, the U.S. 
Administration has changed its approach toward relations with 
Ukraine. The United States does regard Ukraine as a serious 
partner. Moreover, it regards Ukraine as a guarantor of 
stability not only in Central and Eastern Europe but in Europe 
as a whole. Government officials in the United States are 
increasingly speaking of Ukraine is a serious partner. 
  However, there is a certain gap between talk and action. So 
far, we have not bridged this gap. There is still a certain 
one-sidedness in relations between Ukraine and the United 
States, and this one-sidedness is marked by excessive emphasis 
on nuclear policy issues. We are extending efforts to rectify 
this one-sided approach to relations between our two states. 
This was discussed during several meetings between Foreign 
Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of 
State Christopher, and this has been the subject of numerous 
contacts between Ukraine and the United States at expert level. 
I think we will soon hear at least verbal denials that there is 
a one-sided emphasis in relations with Ukraine. 
  A high-ranking delegation is currently preparing to visit 
the 
United States to discuss bilateral economic relations between 
our states. I think that if the negotiations are successful, 
this will indeed launch a new stage in relations between Ukraine 
and the United States involving more extensive areas of 
bilateral relations, and this will prove to all that the United 
States indeed sees Ukraine as a partner. 
  [Marynenko] Thank you. To continue the theme of relations 
between Ukraine and the United States, it is common knowledge 
that the United States is one of the strongest, or rather, the 
strongest world power in terms of its economic and military 
potential. At the same time, although Ukraine has been 
independent for just two years, it is trying get closer to the 
United States, closer in terms of normal cooperation. You have 
just said that a Ukrainian delegation is seriously preparing for 
meetings in Washington at which a wide range of problems will be 
discussed, concerning, I think, not only nuclear arms and not 
only those wretched dollars Ukraine is allegedly trying to cadge 
from the United States for the elimination of nuclear arms, but 
fruitful and mutually beneficial cooperation. 
  Let us look at the U.S. position. You know U.S. President 
Clinton will soon pay an official visit to Moscow. At the same 
time he will visit half of Europe and so on. Ukraine is not 
included in Mr. Clinton's program. Naturally, we have no right 
to dictate the protocol and tell Mr. Clinton that he has to stop 
over in Ukraine. On the other hand, those who prepared this 
visit should have given the matter some thought, since there is 
a certain friction between the United States and Ukraine -- and 
I mean between the United States and Ukraine, not between 
Ukraine and the United States. Why not use the head of state's 
visit to Russia for at least a short meeting with Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk? Here, I think, we see a one-sided 
approach on the part of the U.S. Administration; here we see 
caution: Clinton is trying to consult with Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin before he receives the Ukrainian delegation. One 
can go on and on about the problem. What do you think as a 
diplomat? 
  [Tarasyuk] You are quite right about the U.S. President's 
forthcoming visit to Europe. He will visit a number of 
European, and not only European, states. A total of four states 
will be visited, including Russia, Belarus, and the Czech 
Republic. I must say that a visit requires the consent of two 
parties, and if one of the parties does not deem it possible to 
visit, due to schedule complications, naturally you need to look 
for reasons. 
  I can only express my personal ideas about this. You know 
that the United States was apprehensive about our Supreme 
Council's decision on the START I Treaty ratification and its 
attitude to the nuclear arms Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, 
I think this issue will soon be history. Top-level meetings 
between our presidents will take place, and it is only a 
question of time as to when and where. Whether Clinton will 
consult with Yeltsin on how to deal with Ukraine is hard to 
predict. I think there will be an exchange of views on the 
issue, but it is not for them to decide Ukraine's fate. 
Ukraine's fate is decided here, in Ukraine. 
  [Marynenko] Esteemed Mr. Tarasyuk, according to a 
declassified CIA report, no country, except for China and 
Russia, possesses land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles 
capable of reaching U.S. territory. Tell us please why 
Washington raised such a fuss around nuclear arms deployed in 
Ukraine? 
  [Tarasyuk] I know nothing about this secret [as heard] CIA 
report, but as far as I know from expert reports, there are 
intercontinental ballistic missiles in Ukraine capable of 
reaching U.S. territory, and this is a matter of special concern 
for the U.S. Government. It is actually SS-24 missiles that are 
capable of delivering warheads over such a distance. 
  [Marynenko] I am sorry, again, here is something trivial but 
true. The button, that is, control over these nuclear arms and 
these SS-24 missiles, is in Moscow. Ukraine has no control over 
these arms and has no right to launch them. Excuse me, but why 
not put these claims to Russia as one of the nuclear states? 
Why put these claims to Ukraine? Moscow papers are publishing 
charts that show Ukraine's current nuclear potential allegedly 
several times larger than that of England, France, and China put 
together, etc., etc., etc. They emphasize how many nuclear 
facilities we have, how many warheads, etc., etc. For some 
reason one thing is ignored: It was not Ukraine as an 
independent state that built and maintained this huge nuclear 
potential, but that it is a part of the nuclear potential of the 
monster the former Soviet Union used to be. 
  [Tarasyuk] It is absolutely true, Ukraine had and still has 
no operational control of the nuclear arms deployed on its 
territory. Ukraine cannot operate the launch of these missiles, 
and Ukraine does not seek such control, therefore, there are no 
grounds whatsoever to blame Ukraine for an allegedly posed 
threat. The so-called objectivity of the Moscow press, 
especially with relation to Ukraine, is all too familiar to us 
all. In this connection the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry press 
center issued a statement yesterday that emphasized the 
inadmissibility of the media of the Russian Ostankino television 
studios and Russian president's adviser (Migranyan) making such 
overtly provocative anti-Ukrainian remarks. Naturally, this is 
not conducive to the improvement of the atmosphere in the 
relations between our states; naturally, this does not improve 
the atmosphere for the settlement of these issues. But we must 
pay attention to the realities, and, whenever possible, expose 
false anti-Ukrainian campaigns in the media, especially 
concerning the fact that, as you said, Ukraine has no control 
over nuclear arms that, by a twist of fate, are based on its 
territory and in which the Ukrainian people invested a lot of 
labor, sweat, and money. They are based on our territory, and 
in order to make it clear that Ukraine does not threaten anyone, 
Ukraine has embarked on the process of deactivating, 
dismantling, and reducing the combat readiness of these missile 
systems. By this we shall prove our really peace-loving nature 
and show the entire world that it is not Ukraine that poses a 
threat. 
  [Marynenko] Thank you, Mr. Tarasyuk, for your sincere 
opinion 
on the above problem. But let us come down to earth and, as 
they say, dot the i's. I mean the nuclear arms problem. It is 
simple. Russia now wants to become the sole owner of nuclear 
arms in our region. They took away, and some say stole, our 
tactical weapons -- for which Ukraine has received not a kopeck 
so far -- they took away arms from Belarus, Kazakhstan, etc. 
And now, using all possible and impossible, official and 
unofficial, means of influence over the United States, Russia 
seeks to take away nuclear arms from Ukraine. Or is that only an 
assumption? What do you think? 
  [Tarasyuk] Well, I cannot comment on what Russia seeks. But 
I would like to say that we must not repeat the same mistake 
made when tactical weapons were transferred to Russia for 
dismantling and destruction. 
  [Marynenko] Excuse me, let us talk about Ukraine's stance. 
Ukraine trusted Russia and handed over tactical nuclear weapons 
so as to receive compensation. Confidence, as international 
observers say, worked, but it worked only on Ukraine's part. 
[filing to be resumed after 1000 GMT 3 Jan] 
  [Marynenko] Borys Tarasyuk, you said that some countries 
have already agreed to help us financially. Could you name 
these countries which are ready to help Ukraine in the reduction 
of its nuclear potential? 
  [Tarasyuk] Everybody knows now that the United States has 
made a decision, and not just in principle, but has already 
decided to grant the first part of this aid in the amount of 
$175 million. Financial and technical aid has also been offered 
by the governments of Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and a few 
other countries, but negotiations on this are continuing. 
  [Marynenko] Thank you, and with your permission I will allow 
myself to quote an interview by mathematician Muhammed Siddik 
Afghan, president of the Science and Research Center for World 
Philosophy and Mathematics. He is talking about Ukraine and its 
nuclear arms. I quote: Ukraine needs to keep nuclear arms, the 
scientist says, so as not to wind up defenseless before the West 
which, talking of security, is not eager to disarm itself. A 
weak state will not receive proper aid, either, the scientist 
believes. In any case, arms can be sold, and this is huge money 
which can be used to help the country's economy. What do you 
think? 
  [Tarasyuk] I must say that this scientist's conclusions 
happen to coincide with the stance of the Ukrainian parliament, 
the president and the government of Ukraine which insist that 
the cost of nuclear warheads which Ukraine will be handing over 
for their dismantling and destruction must be compensated. 
There are no differences on this. As for aid to weak states, 
experience proves that it is weak states which receive such aid. 
It would be difficult to imagine a strong, not only in 
military, but first of all in economic terms, state which 
receives aid from somebody. Aid is give to a weak state, of 
course, or to a state which has found itself in economic 
difficulties, which is the case with Ukraine. That is why, I 
think, having no working economy, an economy without clear 
outlines on the one hand, and at the same time seeking to keep 
nuclear arms, without either funds or specialists or capability 
to maintain them, would be illogical, and in this respect one 
may not agree with the scientist. 
  [Marynenko] Allow me to quote one more fragment of the same 
interview on Ukraine by Muhammed Siddik Afghan. He is convinced 
that in 1995-96 Ukraine will see the beginning of economic 
stabilization, and by the year 2000 Ukraine will become one of 
the prosperous countries of the world community. The only way 
out of the crisis, according to the mathematician's 
calculations, lies in close mutual relations among the countries 
of the former Soviet Union. Let me remind you that Mukhammed 
Afghan was the one who predicted a speedy end to the political 
carreer of Yegor Ligachev, in particular; he foretold that 
Gorbachev would be the last president of the Soviet Union and 
calculated Ukraine's independence back in 1990. Such are the 
predictions of the well-known scientist and mathematician. But 
the problem under discussion, the topic of our conversation with 
Borys Tarasyuk, chairman of the national disarmament committee 
and deputy foreign minister of Ukraine, deals with nuclear 
weapons -- so, nuclear weapons and one of the last questions, 
if you don't mind. 
  Mr. Tarasyuk, quite often they maintain here that Ukraine is 
striving for a nuclear-free status and this is being asserted at 
different levels. In your opinion, what formula of this status 
now meets Ukraine's national interests best of all? A difficult 
question, isn't it? 
  [Tarasyuk] May I clarify this question, if you don't mind? 
Ukraine is striving for a nuclear-free status and what form of 
this status is the best today for Ukraine? 
  [Marynenko] Yes, yes. What formula of this status can be the 
best and the most beneficial for us today? After all, we are an 
independent, sovereign state. 
  [Tarasyuk] Well, the decision on achieving a nuclear-free 
status in the future was taken in 1990. We know the political 
conditions under which this decision was taken. Taking this 
decision the Supreme Council of Ukraine reflected the opinion of 
the people of Ukraine which at that time still remained a part 
of the former Soviet Union. At that time this decision was 
perceived with great enthusiasm, and not only in our country but 
far beyond its borders. Eventually, Ukraine obtained genuine 
independence and at present it is building its independent 
domestic and foreign policies. The issue on the nuclear-free 
status arises from time to time during the discussion of the 
main issues of the domestic and foreign policies in Ukraine's 
parliament. I cannot recall even a single decision by the 
Ukrainian parliament dealing with this issue which would not 
confirm and would not contain a confirmation of Ukraine's 
intention to achieve a nuclear-free status. The question is 
when to achieve this status, during which period of time and by 
which way. Strictly speaking, it is on this issue that all 
experts now work on. Precisely this is the biggest problem now 
facing our state. 
  I would like to say that the achievement of a nuclear-free 
status, in my opinion, is a lasting process which will require 
great effort, and not only economic or financial effort, but it 
will also require a balanced approach which would take into 
account all technical, ecological problems and Ukraine's 
possibilities and, in my opinion, the term stipulated by the 
START-1 treaty, namely seven years, is, in our opinion, a 
realistic term for achieving such a status. 
  [Marynenko] Thank you. We have a rather difficult 
conversation today and the topic under discussion is very 
serious: the issue of nuclear armaments. And the last question, 
if you don't mind. 
  When the Supreme Council of Ukraine ratified START-1 experts 
in the West paid their attention not to this ratification, first 
and foremost, but to those reservations which were made by the 
Supreme Council during the ratification. So, they said that 
these reservations completely destroyed the ratification and 
Ukraine would never fulfil the START-1 treaty. What is your 
opinion? 
  [Tarasyuk] If one pretends he is deaf and turns his deaf ear 
to what had been said by the Supreme Council of Ukraine, then, 
of course, one can abandon hopes for any positive result and 
hence for the validation of the treaty and hence for the 
implementation of this treaty not only by Ukraine but by all the 
states, would-be participants in this treaty, in the provisions 
of this treaty. This is why I believe that the logic and 
reasons behind the reservations made by the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine now receive ever growing understanding throughout the 
world. Many scientists and representatives of governments and 
political figures point to the validity of the reservations made 
by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. This validity, the logical 
nature of these reservations made our partners arrive at the 
idea that it is necessary to work jointly so as to reach 
agreement concerning the search for mutually acceptable 
decisions which would help to remove these reservations. This 
is exactly what our government and representatives of Russia and 
the USA now work on. I think there are all grounds to believe 
that we shall be able [to reach mutually acceptable agreements] 
under condition that there is a search for compromises, the 
compromises which would be made not at the expense of Ukraine 
but with regard to Ukraine's national interests, only under such 
conditions is it possible to reach mutually acceptable 
agreements which will help us in the cause of persuading the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine that the reservations are being 
fulfilled.

  [Text] President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk addressed the 
Ukrainian people with New Year's greetings and congratulations. 
He said in part: 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording in Ukrainian, fading into English 
translation] The 1993 year was a difficult year for all of us. 
However, we succeeded in preserving three priceless things: 
peace, the integrity of our land, and democracy. Thanks to our 
peace-loving policy, flexibility, and wisdom of our people, we 
managed to preserve good neighbors and friends abroad. And now 
we have every ground to say that peace reigns supreme under each 
Ukrainian roof, in every Ukrainian home, throughout our great 
Ukrainian land. 
  Although we cannot boast of much success in economic 
reforms, 
but [as heard] the first serious steps have been taken. For 
instance, we succeeded in building the efficient armed forces 
which are capable of defending our sovereign state. Serious 
reforms have taken place in education, as well as in other 
spheres of our life. The Ukrainian Government and the Verkhovna 
Rada [Supreme Council] have done their best to stop the further 
development of crisis in economy and policy. 
  In this connection I would like to call upon all the 
Ukrainian people, political parties, and movements, as well as 
the structures of executive and legislative power, to unite 
their efforts for a successful settlement of the crucial 
problems in our life. 
  First of all, we have to find a just solution to the nuclear 
arms problem. We have to settle the issue concerning the Black 
Sea Fleet, which prevents us from establishing good-neighborly 
relations with Russia. I am sure that our northern neighbor 
will have enough wisdom and goodwill to continue cooperation 
with us in the name of the successful solution of these acute 
problems. 
  Let's unite our efforts in our striving for peace, 
democracy, 
and friendship. 
  I wish every Ukrainian family strong health, happiness, and 
well- being. Happy New Year! [end recording] 
  [Announcer] That was a New Year address to the people of 
Ukraine made by President Leonid Kravchuk.

  [Text] We continue now to broadcast greetings from CIS 
heads of state. Here are New Year greetings from Ukraine 
President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] It gives me great pleasure to 
address all people living in the CIS countries and beyond. I am 
convinced that if we had done this earlier, if each year we 
heads of state had had the opportunity to address people 
directly, there might have been greater mutual understanding, 
because everything -- life and day-to-day living -- has hampered 
us. 
  We should remember and guard like the apple of our eye 
everything good that was started by everyone and the great 
capital that we all possess -- namely, mutual understanding, 
cooperation, and the friendship between peoples which was forged 
in most difficult conditions and at most difficult times. 
  I would like to greet everyone on the occasion of the New 
Year and to wish them happiness and good health. I would like 
to emphasize that Ukraine will do everything it can to help 
resolve the acute problems that now divide us to some extent and 
give rise to certain misunderstandings between us. 
  The first of these is the nuclear problem, and we will 
definitely resolve it and find a way to mutual understanding. I 
can already see the beginning of such a wish on the part of the 
Russian leadership and on the part of the United States. 
  We will definitely solve the problem of the Black Sea. I am 
convinced that we will resolve other problems too. 
  We are gradually gaining experience in improving the CIS to 
a 
position where the structure will work for all of us. In this 
regard, Ukraine will do everything it can to see that here too 
there is mutual understanding, cooperation, and mutual support. 
  Ukraine is a state that has embarked on the path of peace, 
friendship, mutual understanding, and democracy, and we will 
continue to travel this path, strengthening ties and relations 
of good-neighborliness and mutual understanding with all states, 
and first and foremost with our neighbors. 
  I wish you well and wish you happiness by saying: [remainder 
of Kravchuk's address in Ukrainian] Let everything be well with 
you and with us! All the best to you all and good health and 
happiness! Happy New Year in 1994! May this year bring all of 
us happiness and peace and may our hopes be fulfilled! [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Rukh leader Vyachslav Chornovil by Arkadiy </F>
Romm under the "A Call to a Deputy" rubric; place and date not 
given: "There Is No Zhirinovskiy in Ukraine, But There Is Rukh"] 
  [Text] Rukh leader Vyachslav Chornovil has made public a 
memo prepared by the Ukrainian president's internal policy 
service for Leonid Kravchuk. It is probably on the basis of 
this memo that the president said recently that Rukh simply does 
not exist in Ukraine as a mass public political movement. We 
turned to Vyachslav Chornovil, a deputy of the Ukrainian Supreme 
Soviet, for an explanation. 
  [Chornovil] This document, which classifies parties 
according to one principle -- their loyalty to the president -- 
said: Rukh's potential is not above zero, except for some of 
the republic's western oblasts. The president was given false 
information. Our party is the largest democratic organization 
in Ukraine: We have 51,000 members and 2 million supporters, 
plus another 50,000 from "Memorial," the Ukrainian Students 
Union, and other associated organizations. The number of our 
supporters is steadily growing. We should give the powers that 
be their due, however: They help Rukh increase its influence in 
people's minds. The republic ranks second in the inflationary 
race of sorts. Yugoslavia is first, but there is war there. As 
for us, we may go to a situation that was characteristic of the 
Weimar Republic: They sat down for lunch at a restaurant at one 
price, but had to pay at another. 
  [Romm] Do you see the woes of independent Ukraine as 
ineluctable? 
  [Chornovil] No, but only under a different leadership. Our 
state was proclaimed independent by a communist majority in 
parliament, which feared retaliation for its support for the 
State of Emergency Committee. At present that same party 
nomenklatura is still in power. It adopted our slogans about 
statehood, although it did not want any statehood. It talks 
about democracy, although it had put us in jail for those same 
words. It keeps discussing reform, although it does not pursue 
it. 
  [Romm] Monetary reform is also a possibility. They say that 
the grivna will be introduced next January. 
  [Chornovil] I have also heard these rumors. God forbid that 
they should actually introduce it. The grivna with zeros 
deleted will be able to hold out for some time, to show some 
stability to the voters before the elections. Then it will 
slide downward, like the karbovanets. The grivna should not be 
introduced before carrying out broad privatization, selling 
land, and doing many other things that will back up the money. 
We could leave inflation behind in a couple of months, reverse 
the slump in production within 12 to 18 months, and reach more 
or less decent living standards in 5 to 10 years. Rukh has a 
clear-cut program to that effect. 
  [Romm] Ukrainian Supreme Council Deputy Larisa Skorik, your 
former associate in Rukh, said to the parliament that Rukh lives 
on money from "Gurvits, a Jew." 
  [Chornovil] I know Eduard Gurvits, chairman of Odessa's 
Zhovtnevyy district soviet, from the latest presidential 
elections. He campaigned for me. But he has not given us a 
single kopeck either then or now. At the same time, 
entrepreneurs in various cities give us their backing in the 
hope of seeing actual reform. At our latest congress, an 
organization called Economic Rukh was born. 
  [Romm] How do you assess Rukh's chances in the March 
elections for the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet? 
  [Chornovil] They are not great on account of the current 
election law. If the law were similar to the Russian one, Rukh, 
as the most significant party, could have won up to 30 percent 
of seats. 
  [Romm] The Russian law cleared the path for Zhirinovskiy, 
though. 
  [Chornovil] Ukraine does not have its own Zhirinovskiy, 
although his embryos have emerged in the Ukrainian National 
Assembly. It is well known that Ukrainian National Self-Defense 
(UNSD) fighters fought in the Dniester Region and Georgia. It 
is mostly unexceptional persons who will become Ukraine's 
parliamentarians. The law allows workers collectives to 
nominate candidates. State ownership accounts for 95 percent of 
the total in Ukraine. This means that it is directors who will 
win deputy seats. 
  [Romm] But Leonid Kravchuk is not sitting on his hands 
either, is he? 
  [Chornovil] I know that he is hand-picking his own 
candidates in 200 electoral districts through his 
administration. The president needs them so that they will vote 
for canceling early presidential elections. The Central 
Electoral Commission is acting according to calls from 
Bankovskaya Street, where the president has his residence. 
Hence its decisions.

  [Excerpts] Azerbaijan's Government and Armed Forces commit 
a crime against the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] and Armenia 
prior to every jubilant occasion or religious festival. Be it a 
Christian festival or Nowruz [spring festival] or New Year makes 
no difference. The enemy attacked the defense positions around 
Tavush in Mardakertskiy Rayon on 26 December. The onslaught was 
rebuffed. Azerbaijan lost 42 men in the fighting. Another 
attack took place against Askeranskiy Rayon on the same day. 
That, too, was rebuffed. Azerbaijan lost 57 fighters in the 
clashes. 
  The enemy resumed its attacks on the defense positions in 
Mardakertskiy, Martuninskiy, and Askeranskiy Rayons early on 28 
December. The enemy has maintained its onslaught until now. 
However, the NKR military units have been able to check the 
advancing forces. The HAY LUR NEWS AGENCY has reported that NKR 
lost 32 men in the 10-day fighting before 29 December. 
Azerbaijan's military forces were forced to retreat after 
losing 650 men at the battlefronts. 
  Foreign mercenaries are fighting among the ranks of 
Azerbaijan's military units. They are commanded by generals 
from Turkey. However, Azerbaijan's leaders have denied the 
presence of Afghan mojahedin in that republic's armed forces. 
Nevertheless, REUTER has reported that an airplane has recently 
landed in Kabul to return the dead bodies of the Afghan 
mojahedin who were killed in the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
[passage omitted] 
  Azerbaijan's leaders have recently moved to find a way to 
draw Armenia into the fighting. The Azerbaijani troops have 
recently fired on the border towns in Armenia's Idzhevanskiy, 
Tavushskiy, Araratskiy, and other rayons with various types of 
arms.

<F P=106> ["Text" of statement by the Presidential Press Service in </F>
Baku; date not given] 
  [Text] Armenia's mass media outlets have recently 
intensified their frantic behavior against Azerbaijan. This 
approach is aimed at provoking interethnic discord and creating 
a negative image of Azerbaijan's people and an inaccurate 
impression of the nature of the dispute between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan. 
  The reports published by Armenia's news agencies, stating 
that the Azerbaijani people are to blame for the destruction of 
the natural gas pipeline in Georgia's Marneuli Rayon, are 
typical of the unhealthy and insidious Armenian propaganda 
activities. These reports are an example of the information 
disseminated against Azerbaijan. 
  It is true that the pipeline, which supplies natural gas to 
Armenia, was sabotaged in Marneuli Rayon on 18 December. 
However, it is common knowledge that the Armenian military 
units control that (?pipeline). Furthermore, the pipeline is 
protected by mines that were laid by the Armenian side. In 
fact, several Georgian workers sent to repair the damage to the 
pipeline were seriously wounded by an exploding mine. Thanks to 
the measures taken by the leading officials in neighboring 
Kazakhskiy Rayon in Azerbaijan, urgent medical aid was given to 
the wounded workers in Kazakh City. The workers were then 
transferred to Georgia. 
  The matter has nothing to do with Azerbaijan carrying out 
destructive activities and taking hostages. On the contrary, it 
is related to Armenia's harmful activities against the citizens 
in Georgia, which is a sovereign republic, and Azerbaijan's 
humanitarian approach toward those who have been harmed as a 
result of provocative activities [words indistinct]. 
  Undoubtedly, Armenia's provocative activities have not been 
effectively condemned. Unfortunately, [words indistinct] radio 
and television company in Russia have created favorable 
opportunities for the broadcasting of Armenia's completely 
unfounded information without attempting to verify it.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Georgiy Shmelyov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 2 TASS -- Deputy Russian Foreign 
Minister Georgiy Mamedov left for Washington, DC, today to 
coordinate a program of the Russian-U.S. summit to start in ten 
days in Moscow. 
  It is not accidental 1994 starts with a state visit of the 
U.S. President to Moscow. Both sides have always considered 
their bilateral relations a priority of their foreign political 
concepts. Comprehensive trade and economic cooperation with the 
U.S. is especially important for Russia at a period of profound 
changes. 
  Moscow's consistent course at cooperation and partnership 
with Washington is obvious; claims of some mass media bodies 
that Russia no longer considers its relations with the U.S. to 
be a priority are unjustified. 
  The U.S. partners will, certainly, be interested in the 
recent political events in Russia, primarily the results of 
parliament elections. The world was somewhat alarmed with these 
results although they should hardly be exaggerated or dramatized. 
  The U.S. delegation headed by Bill Clinton will study the 
situation on the spot and get acquainted with the essence of the 
reform policy carried out by the Yeltsin team. In the words of 
Bill Clinton, he is a staunch supporter of Boris Yeltsin. The 
visit will help them to understand Russian society has much work 
to do. 
  The recent personnel changes in the U.S. Administration, 
primarily the appointment of First Undersecretary of State and 
Coordinator of the U.S. Policy on Russia and the Commonwealth of 
Independent States Strobe Talbott, testifies to the enhancement 
of the "Russian factor" in the U.S. foreign policy. 
  The Russian diplomatic community has estimated these changes 
as very positive. "Washington promotes people who have 
imagination," believes a high-ranking Russian diplomat. In his 
opinion, Moscow will take adequate steps after the summit. 
  The Moscow summit will also focus on security, cooperation 
in 
arms control and non-proliferation of nuclear arms and key 
international issues, including settlement of regional conflicts. 
  It is expected to be extremely saturated and elaborate a 
program of partnership and interaction for the rest of the 
20th-early 21st century.

  [Text] The Russian-Japanese fishing committee has discussed 
fishing in the economic zones of the two countries and fishing 
quotas. The 10th session of the committee was held in Moscow 
between December 16 and 29. 
  The Russian side, led by deputy chairman of the State 
Committee for Fishing Aleksandr Rodin and the director of 
Dalryba company Yuriy Moskaltsev were dissatisfied with fishing 
in Japan's zone because in the outgoing year Russia failed to 
catch the assigned quota. Among the causes of low efficiency 
they named the small size of areas given to Russia and the 
absence of steady fish resources there. 
  The two sides also exchanged information on the observation 
of fishing rules in 1993. Russian representatives said that the 
number of violations in the Russian 200 mile zone by Japanese 
fishing boats remains considerable: 59 in 1992 and 77 in the 
first 11 months of 1993. 
  The Japanese side promised to take tough measures to prevent 
the violation of fishing rules. 
  The two sides agreed to hold the next session of the 
commission in Japan in November 1994.

  [Text] As you know, the Abkhaz side on 30 December once 
again breached the conditions of the Geneva agreement. More 
than 100 armed Abkhazians entered the village of Ganmukhuri 
which is situated on the other [west] side of the Inguri river. 
In this connection, Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia left 
for Zugdidi. 
  Our correspondent today got in touch with Givi Lominadze, 
chairman of the interim committee for emergency situations in 
west Georgia, and asked him to give us more detailed information 
about the incident. 
  Unfortunately, after the fall of Sukhumi, the villages of 
the 
Zugdidi and Tsalenjikha areas -- Ganmukhuri, Taya, Pakhulani, 
Muzhava, and others -- fell into the hands of the Abkhaz side. 
  After the republic's government troops entered Zugdidi, 
Vakhtang Kobalia's letter asking Ardzinba to keep his promise 
not to enter these villages was found in the desk of one of the 
officials. As it emerged, the first copy of this letter was 
sent to Ardzinba. We do not know how seriously Ardzinba took 
Kobalia's request, but the fact remains that, as we have told 
you above, on 30 December at noon about 100 Abkhazians entered 
the village of Ganmukhuri. According to the local population, 
they behaved correctly. The Abkhazians said that their move was 
prompted by a report alleging that the Georgian side planned to 
attack on 1 January. 
  It must also be said that some Georgian army formations 
whose 
job it was to guard these villages did not carry out the duties 
delegated to them. 
  As a result of negotiations, the Abkhaz side left the 
village. 
  As I have told you, Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia 
left for Zugdidi, where he held a meeting and demanded that 
certain army formations and their leaders treat their duty with 
greater responsibility and guard villages to prevent such 
instances in the future. 
  Batoni [honorific title] Givi Lominadze noted at the end of 
the conversation that every measure is being taken to retain 
peace and stability in the region.

<F P=106> [News conference given by President Leonid Kravchuk on 30 </F>
December; place not given; with questions by unidentified radio, 
television, and UKRINFORM correspondents -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, today is 
New Year's Eve, and on this day people traditionally assess the 
year that is coming to an end. What is your opinion of 1993? 
What have we achieved having lived through it? Or, maybe, you 
think that it will go down in Ukraine's history as a year of 
lost hopes? 
  [Kravchuk] Well, I would say that this year we did not only 
have bad affairs. But, unfortunately, good ones were fewer. 
This is true. 
  Although, to go further and move forward along a more 
clear-cut course and at a faster rate, it was necessary to live 
through this time as well. Although, it could have been 
possible to live through it easier, if so many mistakes of both 
objective and subjective nature were not allowed to occur. For 
example, here are some facts. Over the time that has elapsed, 
though not only this year, Ukraine has withstood such powerful 
price blows that they are even difficult to imagine. For 
example, the price for oil and oil products in Ukraine has grown 
5,000 times over, not 500, but 5,000 times. Sometimes, I even 
think on how the economy managed to endure this. I would like to 
tell you that it is only thanks to our people who are able to 
work under the most difficult conditions, and to our leaders in 
industry and agriculture, farmers, those who are already private 
owners and commercial structures, that we did not collapse 
altogether and already in 1993, especially its end became, say, 
the time of even a certain slow-down in production decline. 
  [Word indistinct] I know that figures have a certain meaning 
when everything is available in the shops, but facts are facts. 
Well, for example, over the 11 months of last year [1992] the 
national income decreased by 18 percent. But in 
January-November of this year [national income decreased] by 13 
percent. Certain enterprises, for example, [word indistinct], 
the Transport Ministry, the State Housing and Communal Economy, 
corporation Ukrmontazhspetsbud [Ukrainian assembly and special 
construction], and others achieved volumes of production that 
exceeded those of last year. Exceeded. The number of electric 
locomotives, specialized [word indistinct] systems, [word 
indistinct] equipment, generators, and woodworking machines has 
grown, in other words, very many other items could be 
enumerated. Also, something has been done in conversion and 
saving fuel and energy resources. This was simply a demand of 
life. Well, I cannot but thank the countryside workers who 
gathered in 45.6 million tons of grain this year. [Word 
indistinct] vegetables and fruits more than last year. Milk 
yields have to increase somewhat. That is to say, something has 
nevertheless, been done. I would not like us to look at our 
life with such pessimism, or form it only [word indistinct]. 
There are grounds to say that something has been done. 
However, if to assess [word indistinct] on a general scale, I 
think this year can be referred to as the year of the beginning 
of a transition toward new forms of economic life. Well, I, for 
example, would mention only some of these. 
  First, we approved a program of anti-inflation measures. 
We managed to work out the principles of relations between the 
state and the agrarian sector. Only recently we discussed this 
issue at the Coordinating Council and agreed in principle on how 
to settle debts. This is very important (?as we are 
responsible) to the farmers who yielded such a rich harvest, and 
who live in poverty, worse than anyone else. We agreed on how 
to give more freedom to regions. For example, there was a 
meeting recently, and I will go through with this affair because 
I am convinced that they do have possibilities to work better 
without the direct interference of the center. 
  We managed to agree with Russia and Turkmenistan on the 
prices and volumes of energy sources, which is principally 
important for Ukraine. That is to say, certain steps got 
underway toward, I would say, more active work here based on 
market and other principles. Therefore, to sum up what I have 
said, it is already possible to say that our time in 1993 was 
not wasted. 
  [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych. All Ukraine had an 
opportunity to watch our people's deputies working in the 
session hall. Quite often it happened that there were about 
190-200 deputies in the hall. But when it is time to vote, the 
Narada electronic voting system shows at least 300-320 [word 
indistinct]. What I have in mind is that some of the deputies 
vote instead of their colleagues, doing this at a sprinter's 
speed when it is necessary to vote. They insert their cards by 
turns and thus adopt relevant documents. But can such documents 
be considered legal? I mean, for example, the latest events 
when the deputies imposed [word indistinct] on the president's 
edicts, in particular, concerning the Blasco-Black Sea Shipping 
Company. The chosen representatives of the people seem to block 
the course of the reform deliberately. What is to be done? Who 
is to blame? [Words indistinct] 
  [Kravchuk] True, from the point of view of law and the 
Constitution, such decisions, if made with such a gross 
violation of the rules, are, as a matter of fact, illegal. 
However, during the past four years the Supreme Council has not 
adopted permanent rules of its activity. And this is one of 
such, well, very important gaps, because the rules are the 
internal law of work. They are the internal constitution. It 
does not exist. If it does not exist one can act this way, 
although the temporary rules clearly define the conditions under 
which the Supreme Council works in a session regime. That is to 
say, there must be not less than two thirds of the deputies in 
the hall. However, this electronic display speeds work on the 
one hand, but, on the other, it gives an opportunity to carry 
out such manipulations. They are being carried out openly, in 
public. This is why it could be possible to do it this way: To 
register at the tables and then vote by a show of hands. This 
is real. It is possible to appoint a counting commission, for 
example, and to work. I just do not see any other option. You 
are correct in saying [words indistinct]. Well, I analyzed this 
myself and charged my [word indistinct]. I can say frankly 
that, for example, there are actually no people there on 
Thursday, especially at the evening session, and on Friday, at 
the two sittings, but the voting goes on. That is to say, 
falsification takes place (?in the eyes of) the people. 
Strictly speaking I am also involved because I sign the laws 
which are adopted. But is there any way out? For example, it 
is written in the Constitution that the law, if not signed by me 
within 10 days, will come into force anyway. 
  Secondly, there is no Constitutional Court where I can 
appeal and say that I want to consider this or that disputable 
issue. They blame me for the fact that the Constitutional Court 
was not elected. I was interested in it most of all, and this 
is why I had been initiating the election of the Constitutional 
Court all the time. But it was difficult to elect it, not only 
because there was a split in assessments by people but, again, 
because there were no people in the hall. When they were 
registering themselves at the tables there was no two-thirds 
majority. 
  I proposed another move when I met the deputies: Let us do 
as 
they do it throughout the world, for example, half is to be 
elected by the president and half is to be elected by you. The 
Constitutional Court chairman has been elected and let the 
Constitutional Court decide: If the president's decree is 
anti-constitutional, the court will say this, if not, the court 
will also have its say. For example, if the court did exist a 
veto is imposed. What is to be done next? According to the 
constitution this veto is to be submitted to the Constitutional 
Court for assessment. At present, the veto is imposed but who 
will assess it? Nobody. Therefore, the Supreme Council has no 
counterbalance that would influence it. For example, there is 
no law to revoke a deputy. The Constitutional Court is 
nonexistent. The rules are nonexistent. 
  In general, one can get an impression that the Supreme 
Council is both the judge and the legislator all together, in 
one organization, as they say. And the president, for example, 
has no specific influence. For example, over this period the 
Supreme Council has already twice given and taken away plenary 
powers from the president. Should I act correspondingly 
adequately? There are no regulators, no levers that I have been 
talking about. This, well, is for example a very dangerous 
thing. And, if you started to talk about these vetoes, then I 
understand. I would not like to analyze now whether this veto 
was imposed correctly or incorrectly. 
  But I would like to say one thing, that this is a purely 
economic and managerial issue, if we take the issue of the Black 
Sea shipping company. And I have dozens of telegrams now, very 
serious telegrams because there are hundreds of ships that sail 
to all ports. Relevant treaties and agreements with foreign 
firms have been concluded. And the veto meant that the 
activities of the shipping company was virtually brought to a 
halt. One hour spent by a ship, either being unloaded or loaded 
in a port, costs thousands of dollars. I would like you to know 
this. And I understand that not everybody knew this. But there 
were people there who deal with, who know what the sea [word 
indistinct] is. So, he came out and said: Esteemed people's 
deputies, this is correct but let us first examine the issue. 
Let us appoint a commission and then take a decision on veto. 
  But, you know, our Supreme Council is seriously affected by 
one illness: presidentophobia. If the president submits 
something, no matter whether it is correct or incorrect, vote it 
down, because this was submitted by the president. Somebody 
even told me that they say: If you want this to be turned down, 
ask Leonid Makarovych to submit it. It will never be adopted. 
That is to say, the real, the contents are 
substituted...[sentence incomplete] I do not want to say that 
this refers to all the deputies. There are some sober-minded, 
clever deputies. Quite a few political figures came from the 
Supreme Council and more will come, I am sure. But the 
situation today is very complicated, extremely complicated and 
the president cannot protect himself, what is important, he 
cannot, he has no levers to put the Supreme Council in its place 
through the Constitutional Court, for example. And the Supreme 
Council is able to put the president in his place by means of 
voting. Where are equal rights, I wonder? Both the Supreme 
Council and the president were elected by the people. But the 
president has no regulators that could influence the Supreme 
Council. This is dangerous, simply dangerous, the more so that 
they vote on their on behalf and on behalf of another person. 
They can vote for anything and this just evokes my anxiety. 
  [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, you probably know 
better than anybody else that people have gotten tired of price 
blows, inflation, and impoverishment. What changes in political 
and economic life of our country do you think can give us hope 
for the better and realize this hope next year? 
  [Kravchuk] First, I have already told you about the steps 
which have already been taken. Second, I hope that the people 
will elect the new Supreme Council; that responsible and 
well-prepared people, those who take the cause to heart, will be 
elected; that raging passions and debates will give place to 
real work; that this Supreme Council will elect the government, 
appoint a government which will also consist of new people with 
new thinking, creative and responsible people. They have 
already come into being in Ukraine over this period. 
  You know, I already observe this process. Someone in the 
government left, but this in no way means that such a person is 
incapable of doing anything. There are relevant conditions and 
situations. In other words, the idea is that people have 
acquired experience and learned a lot over this time, and I hope 
we will manage to unite them, to consolidate them under a single 
idea, a single theme, a single objective. Thus they will be 
able to work and will be of benefit. 
  I again turn to the fact that in its time the Supreme 
Council 
failed to adopt a constitution. You know, they have been 
working for [word indistinct] years, twice submitted something 
to the Supreme Council, but nothing [words indistinct]. And 
there is no hope of it being passed by the Supreme Council. 
This is why I will make a direct appeal with a legal initiative 
to the people, bypassing the Supreme Council, to include the law 
on power on the 27 March referendum, in other words, to provide 
a constitutional law on power which will determine the system, 
the forms of the system, state [word indistinct], regional 
autonomy, thereby determining what Ukraine will be like. 
  For example, I believe we need a parliamentary-presidential 
system, that the president as head of the state must exercise 
relevant plenary powers. The government, the prime minister 
must be head of the executive power and fully responsible for 
all executive power, for economic policy, for government 
programs, and for their implementation. 
  The Supreme Council must be a legislative body. That is to 
say, there must be a delimitation of powers, as is written in 
our Declaration, but no one abides by this so far. And let the 
people vote; this will become the basis. It will be easier for 
the new Supreme Council to adopt all the rest, because, unless 
this is done now, what can the Supreme Council begin with when 
it assembles? To work on the basis of the obsolete Constitution 
which was patched up plenty of times and from which whole 
chapters were excluded? If you read this Constitution you will 
find it consists entirely of contradictions. 
  We have to begin with the constitution, but in the meantime 
laws have to be made. The legislative field is such a difficult 
one; moreover, it has already been ploughed with government 
decrees. To some extent it was changed by the president's 
decrees. If, as sometimes happens, the law differs from the 
decree, the law may be better than the decree. Which should we 
lean on? Some say it is better to rely on the decree, others 
say it is better to rely on the law. So, as you see, there are 
big problems. 
  I think I will ask people to show understanding and vote for 
themselves. This is their foremost right, the right of a 
sovereign people, and when the holder of people's power has made 
its decision, no one's hand or tongue will be urging people to 
elect this one immediately, re-elect another one, dismiss 
someone else, give something to another. Do you see what is 
happening? For three or four years we, the Supreme Council, 
have either been giving or taking away, changing or adding. 
These fundamentals will then be approved by the people and the 
Supreme Council will work on the basis of this law. This is a 
political question of principle. 
  If we do this, we will open the way to political and 
economic 
reforms and to normal functioning of the Supreme Council. So, 
if we manage to do this, as I think our people understand, they 
will know what is soundly based and what is mere foam. If we 
decide this together, we will make a great step forward. I hope 
we will do this. 
  [Correspondent] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, the United 
Nations declared 1994 the year of the family. Our people know 
you not only as the head of state, but also as the head of your 
large, close-knit family, and it was very pleasant to meet your 
family in the press, magazines, and other publications. What 
will be your wishes for the Ukrainian family in 1994 and for the 
families of other nationalities living in our land. What new 
legislation should we expect in terms of family protection? 
  [Kravchuk] First of all, I am head of state, my wife is head 
of the family. My hands are so full with state concerns that I 
am a mere onlooker to what is going on there, and how well it is 
going, but I do not interfere in the way things are actually 
done. She supervises it herself, an she seems to be doing a 
good job. 
  Second, the family is really not just a number of people, be 
it large or small. It is a source of life, a source where the 
morals, the nation, and the people are formed. Life is given 
there, and from there it takes off, develops, and [word 
indistinct] itself. This would not happen without a family. It 
is the determining factor. 
  I know the role played by the woman as mother of the 
family. She gives life, she protects it, and she organizes it. 
If any man thinks he is the one doing this, he is wrong. If 
the woman knows her stuff, she will do it in such a way that he 
will think he did it, but in fact his role is not very big. I 
can see this in my own family, and in the families of my 
friends. I can see how cleverly women do this. 
  Third, in conditions like ours, our women are using their 
(?wisdom), [word indistinct], and skills to solve various 
problems, concerning food or whatever. We can only thank our 
women for this. 
  But our family is not just a family circle. Ukraine is a 
whole family. It is a huge state with a large number of 
nationalities and peoples, a family of people with different 
ethnic origins. I would like to take advantage of this question 
to wish all people living in Ukraine happiness, good fortune, 
and health. 
  I hope nobody will ever even think of saying anything which 
could cause tension in relations between people of different 
ethnic origin. I hope they will all be citizens of our united 
state, and that they will all be masters of it. To that end, we 
will do our best in terms of legislation to make sure that no 
person feels inferior or superior to anybody because of their 
ethnic background. All are equal, and all will have equal rights 
and freedoms. 
  I would also like to mention that numerous Ukrainians are 
living abroad in other states, and that many people of other 
nationalities are living here. We have been living together in 
the former Soviet Union, and it is clear that the kind of 
migration processes still taking place then were a normal fact 
of life. I would like to wish them health and say that we have 
lived through a very difficult year, a year laden with doubt, a 
year of searching. We have been searching within the CIS, there 
was something we found, there was something we failed to find, 
but that depended not only on ourselves, I mean not only on 
Ukraine. 
  The summit in Ashgabat showed how much we have learned in 
forming and upgrading this structure. It is [word indistinct]. 
Ukraine will do its best to make it work efficiently and 
equally for all. As a sovereign state, it requires new 
principles and new foundations. 
  In the next year we must solve the nuclear problem and 
everything connected with it, and I think we will succeed in 
doing this. I hope we will solve the problem of the Black Sea 
Fleet. There is the will to do this. If there is enough good 
will in Russia -- and now the United States is getting actively 
involved in this effort -- it will help us solve many issues. 
  I hope that when all this is put together, all this will 
guarantee one thing for the family: peace. If you ask, not only 
a woman or a mother, but any normal person, they will tell you 
that men always want to look a bit braver than they are, and 
that leads to pugnacity. Men do have this trait, history knows 
it. So, even if you ask them what they want most, what they 
always long for, they will tell you they want peace and quiet in 
the family, under every roof, within our large state, and in 
relations with other states. If we have all this -- and I will 
say sincerely that as long as I am president I will do my utmost 
to ensure peace in every home, in every house, to prevent 
bloodshed in our land -- we will manage everything; we will 
build, restore, and take the democratic and law-governed road of 
development. This is inevitable, we merely need time. But let 
us not destroy that which we have, let us not destroy life. 
  We will greatly intensify and take new steps to step up the 
fight against corruption, crime, and all shameful phenomena now 
existing. We are not concealing a single fact referred to in the 
Supreme Council or elsewhere. I have instructed the 
prosecutor's office to sort this out, and we will show 
everything to the people -- both facts and analysis. Those 
guilty will made to bear responsibility, while the innocent will 
be innocent, and we will not stick labels on them, will not 
insult them or brand them as criminals before the verdict of a 
prosecutor or a court. (?Do not think that because) you happen 
to be a people's deputy you can get away with it. 
  I think we will get over all these diseases in a way worthy 
of our people who are patient, wise, peaceful, and closely 
bound, and will do their best to keep it that way. As for 
families, I wish them good fortune, health, and happiness, 
health to children and grandchildren. I have children and 
grandchildren myself and I know how important this is -- when I 
hear that my daughter or my grandson is sick, I cannot put it 
out of my mind even with the strenuous and difficult job I have. 
Whenever I have a free minute I run to the phone to find out 
how they are, whether their fever is high or not. That's me, 
with my workload. What about other people? Actually the 
workload has nothing to do with it, it is a normal thing for a 
person to want a clearly determined future, to want its family 
to go on and, as they say, to wish that our family will never 
become extinct. 
  I also wish you well, as a woman who has her own family and 
wants her family to be healthy, and all those guarding our 
family. As for the legislation, it will improve.

<F P=106> [By Ukrinform correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Aleksandr </F>
Litvinov for TASS] 
  [Text] Kiev, 30 Dec -- In an interview with Ukrinform and 
Gosteleradio correspondents, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
described 1993 as the year in which Ukraine began a transition 
to new forms of economic life. 
  Although there were many mistakes and miscalculations, he 
admitted, "Ukraine has not slid into the abyss, as some would 
have us believe." The fall in national income was 5 percent 
less than last year, and the decline in manufacturing slowed 
down. The country's industry produced a greater quantity of 
electric locomotives, special-purpose cisterns, power equipment, 
generators, wood working machines, and other goods. Farmers 
also had a good year, gathering 45.6 million quintals per 
hectare, considerably more than in 1992. The milk yield also 
increased. 
  Leonid Kravchuk described an agreement on prices and volumes 
of fuel deliveries to Ukraine signed with Russia and 
Turkmenistan as a positive step in the right direction. 
  In the interview he paid a considerable attention to the 
upcoming elections of people's deputies. The president 
expressed confidence that people would be able to come grips 
with the situation and, bearing in mind the pre-election 
campaign in Russia, would elect truly worthy and experienced

  Taking about the most pressing tasks for the upcoming year, 
Leonid Kravchuk expressed confidence that Ukraine would be able 
to meet its targets for nuclear disarmament and to resolve the 
problem of the Black Sea Fleet in a civilized manner with 
Russia. The main thing for us, the president stressed, is "that 
there should be peace, tranquility, and confidence in the future 
in this common home of ours which we call Earth."

<F P=106> [New Year's address by President Yeltsin; place and date not </F>
given--recorded] 
  [Text] Dear friends! Soon the clock on the Kremlin's 
Spasskaya Tower will chime midnight and we will see off 1993. 
Whatever it was like it will remain in our memories, in our 
history. 
  In this difficult year, civil war almost singed our homes 
and 
crossed the threshold of our Fatherland. I hope that the 
politicians and citizens of our country will learn the lesson of 
these bitter events. 
  There were also important acquisitions in the past year. The 
new Russian Constitution, adopted at a nationwide referendum, 
came into force. It gives a firm foundation for the 
construction of a democratic state and free society. We held 
honest and free elections, and I hope that the people who were 
elected to the Federal Assembly will always listen to their 
people and think about the good of Russia. 
  Now, in the midst of winter, we can say with confidence: 
Russia has bread and staple foodstuffs, and our houses will be 
warm. 
  In the Commonwealth of Independent States we have at last 
virtually reached the understanding that we need to be together. 
We are so indissolubly linked by history, economics and a 
single destiny that it is simply not possible for us to live 
apart. Our people will not allow this, anyway. 
  Dear friends! Now, in keeping with a long tradition, the 
majority of you are at home with your family, with children, 
with your nearest and dearest. Many are celebrating this holiday 
with friends. I wish you happiness in the time you spend with 
each other. May your friends be with you not only in times of 
happiness but also at difficult moments. This is the custom in 
Russia, and it is good that this tradition is alive. 
  Not everyone is celebrating the New Year at a festive table. 
Let us remember them on this New Year's Eve. Let us remember 
those who are guarding our peace, those who are guaranteeing the 
country's normal life, and of course, thanks to those who keep 
our television screens and radios on the air throughout the 
night. 
  On this New Year's Eve I would like to address in particular 
those Russians who are outside Russia's borders. 
  Dear compatriots! You are inseparable from us and we are 
inseparable from you. We were and will be together. On the 
basis of law and solidarity, we defend and will defend your and 
our common interests. In the new year, 1994, we will do this 
with greater energy and greater resoluteness. 
  I hope for you all, dear people of Russia, that the coming 
year is, above all else, peaceful. Preserving peace in Russia 
is my main task as president, but I know that it will be 
incredibly hard to do so without your support. I am counting on 
you in this most important endeavor. 
  I hope that the New Year brings your families more good 
things and more peace of mind. We must be closer to one 
another. Only together will we be able to conquer need; only 
together will we be able to defend our peace of mind; only 
together will we open up a future for our children. May the 
coming year, 1994, be a year of coming together, a year of 
harmony, a year of reason. 
  Dear fellow countrymen, I hope that in the coming year, 
1994, 
that your family will not want for anything. As the president, 
I will spare no efforts to that end. May your secret dreams 
come true and may the ideas that you have not yet managed to put 
into effect be realized in the coming year. 
  May those who are young find their love, and may that love 
be 
a long and happy one. I hope for people of my generation that 
their children and grandchildren will be good and loving. May 
we rejoice in their successes. And may we meet our children as 
often as possible. 
  Dear friends! 
  There are only a few seconds left before the New Year comes 
in. Once again I wish you a Happy New Year. I wish you 
happiness, good health and prosperity!

  [Text] You are watching Vesti. Russia's foreign minister 
[Andrey Kozyrev] is the next to give us his New Year's greetings. 
  [Begin Kozyrev recording] I would like to wish the residents 
of Russia more self-assurance. If we begin to respect 
ourselves, the whole world will respect us -- there are ample 
opportunities for that. Therefore, more self-esteem and less 
panic! Do not succumb to any provocations. Let us simply live 
normally in our own country, cooperate normally with other 
countries, and be the way we ought to be, the way we really are. 
  I think this, in fact, is my wish for 1994 -- that it should 
be a year of stabilization and a year which should see the 
transformation of Russia into a normal, self-respecting great 
power. [end recording]

  [Text] As Interfax has learned, Russia's government has 
sent to Yeltsin proposals on a cabinet reform. A presidential 
decree to this effect is expected after the New Year Holidays. 
  A well-placed source does not rule out that Yeltsin may 
modify the proposals, drafted by and large by First Vice-Premier 
Yegor Gaydar and his team. 
  According to a presidential spokesman, candidates to a 
reformed government have been asked to decide where to work: in 
parliament or in the council of ministers. Although, formally, 
the presidential decree on the possibility of alternating 
ministerial job with parliamentary activity is still in effect, 
future cabinet members have been told that such alternation 
would be inexpedient. 
  It is assumed that the Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin 
will have four deputies, one or two first assistants among them. 
Yegor Gaydar will retain the post of first vice-premier. It is 
not clear yet whether the current first deputy Oleg Soskovets 
will keep his rank or become an ordinary assistant. 
  Anatoliy Chubays and Boris Fedorov are regarded as the most- 
likely candidates to yet another two vice premier vacancies. 
However, vice-premiers will most probably be barred from 
combining their posts with ministerial jobs. Fedorov is 
currently Finance Minister, and Chubays is in charge of the 
State Property Committee. 
  According to information from other sources, the situation 
with Fedorov is not fully clear. It's not ruled out that he may 
merely become finance minister and quit the post of vice-premier. 
  These sources regard as virtually settled the issue on the 
resignation of the current Vice-Premiers Aleksandr Shokhin and 
Sergey Shakhray. 
  They believe that First Deputy Premier Vladimir Shumeyko may 
resign, if he is nominated to the office of Speaker of the 
Federation Council - the new Parliament's Upper House. 
  The number of ministries is planned to be cut down to 30 
with 
those reduced to be transformed into state committees. As a 
result of the reform, the cabinet's staff is to be slashed by 
20-30 percent.

  [Text] Russian President Yeltsin has called on staff 
members of the presidential structures to develop constructive 
cooperation with the new parliament. 
  The new parliament is more clever, more intellectual, and 
more politically competent than the previous body of Soviet 
power, Yeltsin said at a meeting with leaders of departments of 
the presidential administration that took place in the Kremlin 
Thursday [30 December]. 
  The year was difficult, he said, but the country has had for 
the first time free elections and has a democratic Constitution. 
  An Interfax correspondent reports that the president has 
stressed the need to improve the analytical work of the 
presidential apparatus. 
  Emphasis should be put on the quality, not quantity, of 
materials prepared by experts, he said. 
  The president has spoken out in favor of a reduced 
presidential apparatus. At the stage of discussions, he said 
all presidential staff members should advance proposals for 
decision-making, but once a decision is made, they should all be 
in agreement.

"Boris Fedorov Will Remain Vice Premier. Shakeup in Government 
May Affect Aleksandr Zaveryukha"] 
  [Text] Boris Fedorov, Russian Federation finance minister, 
does not intend to reign for the time being. This was told to 
your SEGODNYA correspondent by a high-ranking Russian Federation 
Government official who wished to remain unnamed. The vice 
premier repeatedly stated earlier, in confidential discussions, 
his unwillingness to work in a coalition government. The 
Constitution, however, permits the president to form the cabinet 
personally. The participation of Mr. Fedorov in Viktor 
Chernomyrdin's coalition government is quite possible on 
condition that the course toward financial stabilization will be 
preserved. 
  To all appearances, Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, who 
became member of the Russian cabinet back in summer 1991 and who 
at one time played the leading role in forming the 
post-Communist government of Yegor Gaydar, will keep his 
position in the government, too. One of the reasons for his 
keeping the role of supervisor of the foreign economic bloc, 
experts think, is that there are no aspirants yet in sight for a 
position in which one is supposed to handle the problem of 
Russia's relations with the other CIS countries. Besides, 
Aleksandr Shokhin is Russia's director of the IMF and the World 
Bank, and in line with the charters of these international 
finance organizations, the term of office in this position is 
two years. 
  At the same time, Gennadiy Melikyan, nominated by Aleksandr 
Shokhin and his comrades in arms in the Party of Russian Unity 
and Accord [PRES], is apparently threatened with resignation. 
According to some information, the State Committee for 
Nationalities Policy led by the head of the PRES, Vice Premier 
Sergey Shakhray, will also be scrapped. It is not to be hoped 
that Mr. Shakhray will leave administrative bodies. According 
to unofficial information, he intends to combine parliamentary 
activity with work in the president's staff. Boris Saltykov, 
who currently holds the position of deputy science minister, 
also pins his hopes for a further political career on the State 
Duma. The candidacy of former vice premier Mr. Saltykov will in 
all probability be offered by the ruling cabinet for the 
position of Duma deputy speaker. 
  Mr. Zaveryukha, vice premier for agriculture, who leads the 
Agrarian Party, may lose his position. His vigorous lobbying in 
the Council of Ministers may become even an even more 
significant reason for that than the fact that his party's 
faction in the Duma is in open opposition to the government and 
president.

<F P=106> [Ivan Zasurskiy report in the "Version" column: "A </F>
Government Is Being Formed. No-Nonsense Struggle Is Under Way 
Under the Christmas Tree," incorporating "Prerequisites" subhead 
by Sergey Vedeneyev and "postscript" by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] 
  [Text] Judging by reports from reliable sources, the 
reform of the Russian Government is going to be drastic. The 
institution of vice premiership is to be cut down to five posts: 
two first vice premiers (Oleg Soskovets and Yegor Gaydar) and 
three plain vice premiers. 
  In fact it is in the second echelon of vice premiers that 
the 
main struggle over titles is expected to occur. The constant 
haggling over the posts is beginning to produce some curious 
results: It appears that the carefully prepared reshuffle which 
will be announced on 5 January should toss overboard two 
radicals from Russia's Choice (Boris Fedorov and Anatoliy 
Chubays) and two "moderates" who have displayed relative 
disloyalty -- Aleksandr Shokhin and Sergey Shakhray (Party of 
Russian Unity and Accord) [PRES]. 
  This should be regarded only as a tentative prediction 
because the decisive battle for the seats has not begun yet: At 
yesterday's session of the government presidium -- marked by the 
absence of the finance minister -- instead of the announced 
agenda, a ceremony was held to express collective best New 
Year's wishes to first-echelon officials. 
  Therefore so far the main intrigue is developing not in the 
government itself but around it. The lineup of forces in the 
government remains so shrouded in mystery that it is even 
impossible to say whether the Economy and the Finance Ministries 
will be merged to "suit Gaydar" or whether the deck will be 
reshuffled differently: On one hand, the first scenario is more 
logical if one proceeds from the president's assurances and 
Gaydar's self-assurance. On the other, yesterday it was planned 
to "give hell to Urinson" following his presentation of a reform 
program, which has not as yet happened. 
  Intrigues around the government last week came through in a 
number of statements by Yegor Gaydar and Oleg Soskovets. The 
main point of contention was still over the necessity or 
uselessness of financial stabilization. 
  Meanwhile the financial stabilization intrigue, with the 
present condition of the Russian economy and with the current 
composition of the parliament, is a unique case of intensive 
care measures being administered to a stillborn baby. Moreover, 
it is becoming clear today even for "practical workers" that 
even theoretically the struggle against inflation by limiting 
demand will not only provoke social upheavals like the miners 
crisis (only of a general character) and further slackening of 
industrial activity, but neither (sic!) will it stop inflation. 
  Yegor Gaydar's statements in the "Moment of Truth" [TV 
program] with Andrey Karaulov to the effect that Russia was so 
close to financial stabilization in 1992 and what a little way 
it has to go to reach it today were obviously of a "provocative" 
character and did not correspond to reality. Which posed 
observers the dilemma: Either Gaydar is mistaken or he is 
telling a lie. The most feasible is the version of "eyewashing" 
the president (who is not an economist) and provoking Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. With the emerging "president-premier" standoff, 
Gaydar, mindful of the president's promise to keep him in the 
cabinet, is apparently targeting his strike against his radical 
colleagues, which will cause the replacement of the 
Fedorov-Chubays combination with Shokhin-Shakhray. 
  The brilliant game played in public is apparently doomed to 
success. This success, however, will remain purely internal and 
will hardly affect the cabinet's performance. This in fact 
underlies the hopes that the elimination of reformers from the 
cabinet will be less painful for the country because with the 
exception of Shakhray there is no one to deal with regional 
policy; and, with the exception of Shokhin, no one to conduct 
balanced talks with the EC. 
  Moreover, the departure of the PRES leaders from the 
government will not have a stabilizing effect on 
government-parliament interrelations. At the same time, the 
replacement of those radicals who have assumed responsibility 
for botched (economic and political) reforms can moderate 
Gaydar's appetite for far-reaching confrontational 
transformations, while except for him, the president does not 
trust any other economist. 
<H5>  Prerequisites </H5>
  As the scheduled date draws near, when the renewed 
structural 
and personal composition of the government will become widely 
known to the public, there is natural impatience and a growing 
wish to find out the consequences of particular figures' 
appearing at the head of the executive branch. 
  Anyone lucky enough to attend a conference of a narrow 
in-circle at 1100 on Tuesday, 28 December in Volynskoye near 
Moscow, could have satisfied his natural curiosity. It 
discussed in particular the composition of the future government. 
  It is hardly reasonable, however, to rely on such guesswork 
even if coming from the most well-informed in-people. In the 
end the decisions will be made by a person with fine political 
intuition that has never failed him so far at the most 
responsible moments. The president has always fully understood 
the importance of cadre work, personally deciding many questions 
related to appointments. 
  As for the general trend of the upcoming (and already 
proceeding) cadre reshuffle, it is apparently based on the 
following prerequisites. 
  Balance. The need for a balanced approach conditions the 
aspiration to achieve such a correlation of leading cadres in 
political posts which would most fully reflect the emerging 
balance of political forces and allow him to consider himself 
the president of "all Russians," at the same time guaranteeing a 
consistent continuation of reforms -- even if with certain 
adjustments. Such an approach leaves no room for radicals or 
extremists of any description in the Russian leadership and 
opens the way for more moderate leaders. 
  Reliability. The need for guarantees of future mutual 
understanding explains the choice of people who are personally 
known and devoted. As the previous course of events has shown, 
these may include some fairly unexpected figures (for example, 
those well known in the process of past work in party bodies). 
  Professionalism. This quite reasonable demand is very hard 
to implement in practice. First of all, it ill matches the 
previous criterion. Second, the type of professional leader in 
statesmanship has not as yet taken proper shape in Russian 
organizational culture. 
  Continuity. No matter how one might wish, it is extremely 
difficult and not really necessary to replace everybody 
simultaneously. This process acquires a gradual character and 
therefore the question of priorities in the effecting changes 
arises. 
  Shooting the Losers [otstranennost]. The supreme interests 
of self-preservation inevitably call for scapegoats and fall 
guys to be found. They will be found because they provide an 
easy opportunity to absolve oneself of responsibility for 
failures and shift it on the part of leadership that is 
replaced, which can and should be sacrificed. 
  Subjectivism. The logic of the president's thinking is hard 
to explain since many of his decisions are of an intuitive 
character. He also quite confirms this himself. Let us recall, 
for instance, his famous interview with E. Ryazanov ("Does it 
not seem to you that your are being led from somewhere up 
above?" -- "Yes, indeed, it does.") 
<H5>  P.S. </H5>
  According to some reports, Vladimir Kvasov, chief of the 
Russian Federation Government apparatus, has been accorded the 
rank of minister. It should be noted that Mr. Kvasov was 
elected to the State Duma in the 112th Orekhovo Zuyevo 
constituency in Moscow Oblast. 
  Some sources report that the following alignment of forces 
in 
the cabinet is quite probable: Viktor Gerashchenko gives way to 
Boris Fedorov who will in turn be replaced by Yegor Gaydar. 
  Such a figure as Yuriy Luzhkov is also being considered but 
according to some behind-the-scenes strategists, his time will 
come later -- in presidential elections because Luzhkov, in 
their opinion, can become a good match for Zhirinovskiy.

  On Wednesday President Yeltsin dismissed Yablokov from the

appointed him the chairman of a mixed environmental safety 
commission of the Russian Security Council. 
  "That was my request, Yablokov stressed. Lately I could not 
work effectively enough. I said that to the president, implying 
that he did not take much interest in environmental matters 
either." Yablokov said that the decisions of the mixed 
commission will be compulsory for discussion, unlike the 
recommendations of a presidential advisor.

  [Text] Acting chairman of the Russian Constitutional Court 
[CC] Nikolay Vitruk told Interfax that in 1994 the court should 
become an impartial body of constitutional justice. 
  The CC made its contribution in 1993 to the making of a 
democratic state even though its own coming of age as the top 
body of constitutional justice was not easy, Vitruk said. In 
his view, the court's biggest success were the decisions in 
which it upheld the rights and freedoms of individuals. 
Numerous rulings were handed out that established equality of 
the citizen and the state in the courts of law. "We defended 
the right of everybody to be protected by courts in resolving 
any conflict between the citizens and the authority," Vitruk 
emphasized. 
  The Constitutional Court has on numerous occasions sent 
messages to the government on specific issues such as pensions 
and benefits for victims of the Chernobyl disaster. "I think 
that in this respect the CC was a success story and became a 
tool of democracy. Russian society needs it as such," Nikolay 
Vitruk is convinced. 
  On the other hand, the making of the Constitutional Court 
was 
not smooth, he emphasized, notably as far as the confrontation 
between the executive and legislative authority is concerned. 
The CC head recalled that earlier legislation on the court 
"allowed dragging it into the political struggle." 
  Vitruk believes that both houses of parliament will apply to 
the Constitutional Court in 1994. He thinks that new 
legislation, now under consideration, should make it impossible 
to drag the court into political conflicts on either side.

  [Text] Moscow, 2 Jan -- Sergey Filatov, President Yeltsin's 
head of staff, is currently working on the creation of an 
analytical council of experts to provide practical assistance to 
the president in the performance of his constitutional duties, 
he said in an interview with ITAR-TASS. 
  According to the chief of staff, the three analytical 
centers 
that used to work separately to the president will shortly be 
reorganized into a single unit. This unit, or council of 
experts, will concentrate all analysis coming in from the 
various research structures and draw up recommendations for the 
president, the government, and Russian regional leaders. 
  The council of experts, as the prototype for a future 
administration of the head of state, will work on the 
president's special programs and on his yearly greetings 
messages.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Filatov, head of the presidential </F>
administration, by an unidentified correspondent; place and date 
not given; from the "Novosti" newscast--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] How do you see the first day of a 
session of the new parliament? I understand that it is not a 
rewarding business to make forecasts now, but still, as far as I 
know, both voters and deputies expect the president to make a 
speech during the first day of the session. Will this happen? 
  [Filatov] You know, deputies are calling for this. They 
would like to start their work by meeting with the president, by 
a presidential speech. Such a program is currently being 
considered and prepared, though I am aware that Boris 
Nikolayevich has the final say on that. He must make the final 
decision on how to start cooperation with deputies. 
  That is the first thing. The second thing is that one should 
be aware that people are tired of pointless discussions and 
confrontations. One should understand that what people really 
want is political stability in the country. The third thing 
that gives inspiration is that despite what is being said about 
the economic reform, or how much it is being blamed, its results 
are obvious. No one can deny this. Both the government and 
experts have predicted that 1994 might be a crucial year, and 
this also yields a certain optimism. 
  If one were asked what year one would have liked to see come 
in, I would have said 1945. It seems to me that there is 
something deeply philosophical and humane in this. Hopes of 
victory, hopes of stability, hopes of peace, and hopes of calm 
-- it seems to me that there is very profound sense in all of 
this. I would like to live to see all this, and I think that if 
everyone understood that, and in particular those who will play 
a significant role in deciding the country's future, it would be 
a significant contribution to the country's development and to 
the process of stabilization.

<F P=106> [By unidentified correspondent, including recorded remarks </F>
by Gennadiy Burbulis, president of the Strategiya humanitarian 
and political science center; from the "Tsentr" newscast] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] The Strategiya [Strategy] center, 
created by Gennadiy Burbulis after his removal from official 
power structures, has summed up the results of the first year of 
its work. The existence of the center is no secret today, but 
its work, as well as the personality of its president, are 
shrouded in some kind of mystery. 
  [Burbulis] There is awareness about the center. They do not 
know what it does, what results have been achieved, but the 
world knows it is there, and this is our achievement, as it were. 
  [Correspondent] Speaking on the urgent issue of creating a 
political party, Gennadiy Burbulis stated that, sadly, he has 
had to be publicly involved, of late, in a dialogue on this 
issue with President Yeltsin, whose desire to also build a party 
comes into confrontation with Yeltsin's aspiration to be and 
remain an arbitrator of the society. 
  [Burbulis] Our objective is to help Yeltsin to understand 
the 
following: That any further attempt to remain an arbitrator is 
threatening to him personally and to his political biography, 
and therefore, is threatening to the whole country. The 
transitional stage that we are undergoing, the sheer scale and 
depth of the contradictions, and of the clash of interests do 
not allow the president to take a stance of arbitrator today. 
One thing is to be a political arbitrator, and another thing -- 
to be a president who adopts a certain position in a clear-cut, 
business-like, and committed way, but at the same time, who is 
able to engage in a dialogue with all other political structures 
in the country and in the society. These are different things. 
Yeltsin needs to take up a clear position, to stop playing 
patron to the nation, especially since the nation is simply not 
there as such, so this precludes this patronage, what the nation 
badly needs is leadership. Yeltsin must learn to conduct 
dialogue with the society in forms for which a serious school of 
democratic leadership is needed. 
  Should our assessment be correct, to some extent, then 
indeed 
one will not be able to move even a step forward without a 
party. However, this cannot be a presidential party any more. 
This cannot be a party built on Yeltsin's charisma. This must 
be a two-way street: Of the president moving toward the society 
and of society, in its growing awareness of the necessity of 
such political structure. 
  They must both grow up mutually to meet this challenge. I 
believe our center can be equally useful by way of inspiring the 
authority and the person in authority, and by helping to 
implement this demand in practical terms.

  [Text] The four terrorists arrested last Monday [27 
December] in the outskirts of Makhachkala, Dagestan, were 
brought on Wednesday night to Rostov-on-Don, where they 
kidnapped a group of school children last week. The Rostov 
Interior Department informed INTERFAX that the terrorists were 
being detained at a preliminary investigation prison in the 
city. The investigation is expected to continue in the new year. 
  According to INTERFAX reporters, on Thursday the local 
administration is planning a reception for the participants in 
the operation to release the hostages. 
  Meanwhile, the Chechen Interior Ministry has informed 
INTERFAX that not a single dollar banknote has been found on the 
territory of the Chechen republic: The terrorists claimed that 
they scattered banknotes flying over the republic. Earlier 
reports said several banknotes were found near Mineralnye Vody. 
It is believed that the terrorists scattered the banknotes when 
they flew on a helicopter from Mineralnye Vody to Makhachkala 
with the purpose of misleading law enforcement bodies.

<F P=106> [Interview with V.P. Kvasov, leader of the Russian </F>
Federation Government apparatus, by Iosif Galperin; place and 
date of interview not given: "Civil Servant Should Have a Proud 
Ring, Believes V.P. Kvasov, Leader of the Russian Federation 
Government apparatus"] 
  [Text] ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA has published a document 
defining the concepts of the federal state service and the 
federal state employee and precisely and clearly prescribes the 
bans and benefits connected with this service and outlines the 
civil servant's path from consultant to state adviser. We asked 
Vladimir Petrovich Kvasov, under whose leadership the document 
is being elaborated, what gave rise to its appearance. 
  [Kvasov] Today we are in practice creating a new state. All 
its ideas are included in the draft Constitution adopted by the 
nationwide referendum. The controllability of the economy 
requires the building of an absolutely new state service system 
and its standardized regulation. At federal, regional, and 
local level. There is a decision of the president's on the 
restructuring of the management apparatus and even earlier 
decisions on the restructuring of local organs came into force. 
It was for this that a statute was adopted to ensure that from 
the outset state service is joined by qualified people. 
  The edict states that this statute does not regulate 
questions of the posts of government members, the leader of the 
president's administration, and other so-called political posts. 
What is new for Russia is that we are distinguishing between 
administrative and political posts. We are approaching an 
establishment of power whereby political leaders come and go but 
the apparatus operates. That is necessary for the stability and 
continuity of power and in addition the civil servant will be 
protected from political tyranny. 
  This statute is the first attempt in Russian history to put 
state administrative workers in their places. The actual 
mechanism for making and executing decisions and monitoring the 
job and the person doing it has been recorded. There are also 
prohibitions. For instance, they cannot take part in strikes. 
The civil servant does not have the right to hold another post 
at the same time. Teaching is an exception. The state employee 
does not have the right to engage in business personally or even 
through agents, to be a representative of third parties in a 
state organ and use for nonofficial purposes information which 
has been supplied to him, or to receive a fee for publishing 
items as part of his official activity. 
  [Galperin] In Germany, for instance, state service is 
considered one of the most privileged of jobs. If a person 
joins the state service his whole life ahead is assured. And 
that plus point is evened out by very powerful protection 
against minus points, there is a law on the ban on professions, 
they do not accept political extremists for state service. For 
instance a Communist Party or Fascist Party member cannot be a 
state employee... 
  [Kvasov] The state service should be outside party 
allegiance. That does not mean that the employee does not have 
the right to belong to a particular party or public 
organization. That is a violation of human rights. But he must 
not be tied by party decisions, which is enshrined in the 
statute. That is the first, quite mild, stage. 
  [Galperin] When political life in the country once becomes 
settled, when the parties' real political faces become clear, 
then this requirement for a state employee will probably be made 
specific by some separate statute and separate law and so forth? 
  [Kvasov] Initially we were more specific. But we decided to 
leave it like that for the time being. That is also a step 
forward, although it must be said that a number of norms 
envisaged by the draft statute are not norms for direct action 
(the institution of state posts and the determination of 
qualifications requirements for them, and others) and should be 
made more specific by other Russian Federation legislative acts. 
At the same time their inclusion in the draft lends the statute 
integrity, provides an opportunity for the consistent building 
of a state service system in accordance with necessity and as 
these acts become ready and also facilitates the transition in 
the future to legal norms. 
  [Galperin] Take the following example. In Bashkortostan it 
was the Supreme Soviet chairman who signed a secret edict about 
how all civil servants in any state organs have the right to a 
10-year loan at an interest rate of 8 percent for an amount 
equal to 120 monthly salaries. This was adopted before the 
elections and started to operate during the elections. From the 
viewpoint of morality, for instance, that is understandable, but 
how to assess this from the viewpoint of the statute on the 
state employee in general? 
  [Kvasov] The state employee, because the state places him in 
an organizational framework, should have a certain compensation. 
But the compensation should be the same for all. In Bashkiria 
and Ryazan Oblast. That is the principle. But I consider such 
regional decisions to be purely populist. 
  [Galperin] Perhaps the most interesting thing for readers 
will be the new table of ranks. Will the "titular counsellor" 
and "collegiate assessor" really become modern again? 
  [Kvasov] We spent a long time discussing the introduction of 
a table of ranks. Before the revolution it simply defined a 
civil servant's place in the official hierarchy but did not 
touch on the range of his duties. We decided to reintroduce it 
but within a system with other solutions. Materially a "rank" 
adds little, merely a small percentage increase. The main thing 
here is the moral incentive. For instance, a third class 
consultant (the lowest rank) knows he can serve to a higher 
rank. The top civil servant is a full state councillor of the 
Russian Federation. Any rank is retained upon retirement but is 
referred to as "retired," which should attract people to state 
service. And, second, people will start to treat their work 
more responsibly. 
  In our state service now we have cases of corruption and 
abuse of official position. And how should we fight this? By 
increasing responsibility and involvement. For instance, having 
worked 12 and one half years in state service a man can later, 
when he reaches pension age, receive a pension which is 80 
percent of his salary. And the pension is then indexed. 
  [Galperin] It is still hard for the state to vie with 
private firms and particularly with joint ventures.... 
  [Kvasov] Indeed, responsibility there is less and wages are 
bigger. But state service is stabler. An employee can be 
thrown out of a firm at any time, but just try doing that here! 
Look at what a complex dismissal process has been included in 
the statute. 
  You must understand that when a person does not value his 
job, when a civil servant thinks, never mind, if they dismiss me 
I shall join a private firm and earn several times more, it is 
then that temptation arises. In the West an attempt to bribe a 
civil servant ends with the civil servant dragging the briber to 
the police. A man there feels he is a representative of the 
state, second, the state protects him, so he cannot be gotten 
to. In our country, unfortunately, there has been none of all 
this. In the past a party card was some kind of restraining 
factor. But when the oppression of party commitments 
disappeared the double-headed flower of corruption immediately 
bloomed in the organs of state management at all levels. 
  The new statute is one attempt, by increasing the value of 
state service, to struggle against corruption. We are seeking 
to change the attitude which has formed over the past 75 years 
which views the civil servant as a bureaucrat. What is 
bureaucracy? If you look it up in Dal, it is what the state 
needs. You remember how KROKODIL used to portray bureaucrats in 
our country? The bureaucrat sits there and looks up some 
paragraph or point or other. And he says that according to some 
rule you cannot do something. But who wrote that rule? The 
state. That means we blamed the bureaucrat for observing the 
state's interest. Do you understand? That is, in first 
publishing a law we implied it was for paper only, for form's 
sake. And those who tried to observe the letter of the law were 
called bureaucrats. But today that is precisely the kind of 
person we need. We are issuing thousands of laws, decrees, and 
directives. And to ensure that they all operate we need people 
who can fulfill them. At present we have a situation in which 
if we like a decision we fulfill it and if we don't we pretend 
it does not exist. But if some control organ or some inspector 
"catches you out" then you say: "Oh, sorry, we overlooked it! 
We forgot to pay 500 million rubles tax...." 
  [Galperin] At the time of early perestroyka the main 
slogan was that there were too many bureaucrats. The 18 million 
people employed in the management apparatus had to be reduced, 
etc., and now there are also sometimes accusations that since 
the reforms the number of apparatus workers has not declined. 
  [Kvasov] Naturally, today even in the field of economic 
management we cannot retain all structures in the form in which 
they existed a year ago. They are beginning to harm matters. 
We must constantly adapt the management structure's 
substructure to the new economic realities. So there is nothing 
surprising about the fact that we periodically abolish some 
ministries and create some organs. That is an ordinary 
redistribution of functions between state organs -- a 
redistribution dictated by life. 
  [Galperin] And between Moscow and the regions. 
  [Kvasov] First, an increasing number of functions are being 
taken from the center and transferred to the regions. Look at 
the Constitution. It does not state that the government 
manages. Although it is not ruled out that an integral system of 
state enterprises will remain in our country. But that is not 
the main thing. The government elaborates and submits a state 
federal budget and ensures its fulfillment. That is its task is 
to pursue a unified financial and monetary and credit policy. 
The government only manages federal property. And the amount 
of federal property is constantly dwindling. We are also 
issuing it to the regions so naturally with the reduction of the 
volume of federal property there will be a reduction in the 
sphere of federal management. Although some new structures may 
perhaps be created in the regions. But at a completely 
different level, not vertically but horizontally.

  Question: What are the main principles and tasks of the 
Russian president in 1994? 
  Answer: The domineering prerequisite of stability in 1994 is 
the new Russian Constitution. I would like to point out that 
the Constitution is reliably protected by the free will of the 
people and that the president, as a guarantor of the 
Constitution, has a reliable mechanism for its protection. The 
main political task of President Boris Yeltsin is the 
realisation of the new Constitution both in the Russian state 
system and relying on basic democratic provisions of the 
Constitution. 
  Question: What will the president's relations with the 
Federal Assembly rely on? 
  Answer: In its relations with the Federal Assembly the 
president will act in alliance with all political forces 
interested in the protection of Russia's interests and the 
development of its reforms. The character of this interaction 
will depend on an extent to which political parties and blocs 
represented in the Federal Assembly show respect for Russia's 
constitutional will and on what lessons participants in a 
political dialogue learned from past experience. 
  Rejecting the practice of confrontation, the president is 
prepared to take advantage of all powers granted to him by the 
Constitution to defend democracy, reforms, Russia's integrity 
and stability. 
  Question: What do you believe to be main priorities of 
Russia's state policy in 1994? 
  Answer: In the economic policy, priority will be given to 
strengthening factors of financial stability, curbing inflation 
rates, strengthening the rouble and giving support to a sound 
industrial base. 
  In the social policy, the emphasis will be laid on the 
protection of the population from criminals and the creation of 
fair and worthy conditions for honest and peaceful labour. 
  Undoubtedly, the Russian foreign policy will lay the 
emphasis 
on the protection of Russia's national interests, the rights of 
the Russian and the Russian-speaking population in the framework 
of international law and proceeding from the idea of national 
solidarity.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Isakov "Parliamentary Diary" dated 27 December: </F>
"Greedy Alogrithm"] 
  [Excerpt] What Is There To Be Ashamed of? 
  This could happen only in Russia: The new constitution, a 
bombastic panegyric in its honor, and two edicts which totally 
contradict it and cancel out the contents of several articles of 
the constitution at once are published on one and the same page 
in the government newspaper. 
  One of the edicts is entitled "On Guarantees of Local 
Self-Management in the Russian Federation," but it would be more 
accurate to call it "On the Elimination of Local Self-Management 
in the Russian Federation," for it virtually eliminates the 
rights of local self-management. 
  Elections to organs of local self-management are scheduled 
at 
the suggestion of the superior administration head, who also 
decides on the election procedure. Local administration 
officials are permitted to combine their post with work on the 
representative organ, and the administration head is also 
permitted to chair its sessions. If such a perfectly "tame" 
representative organ turns obstinate for some reason, this does 
not matter -- the administration head himself has the right to 
put the statute on local self-management to a referendum. Here 
is a very eloquent detail, albeit, of course, not the most 
important one: It is not the soviet but the self-same local 
administration head who now gives his consent to a people's 
deputy's discharge from work, to his exclusion from a collective 
farm, cooperative, or educational institution, and also to his 
transfer to lower-paid work. Know, deputy, who is master of the 
house! 
  How familiar all this is: the same ploys, the same tricks. 
Only they have been switched from the all-Russia level to the 
local level. And there is the same total disrespect for the law 
and the constitution. 
  Please forgive my juridical tediousness, but I will indicate 
specific articles: This edict violates Article 10 (separation 
of powers), Articles 15 and 76 (supremacy of the constitution 
and laws), Articles 85 and 90 (president's competence), and also 
Chapter 8 (local self-management) of the new constitution which 
has just been announced. Since the edict came into force the 
moment it was signed, not the moment it was published, it also 
violates universally recognized human and civil rights enshrined 
both in the Constitution (Article 15) and in international 
treaties. 
  The second edict, which exempts from value-added tax the 
turnover from sales of precious metals and precious stones, is 
also equally unconstitutional. According to Yeltsin's 
constitution (Articles 71, 76, and 104), such decisions have to 
be drawn up in law and can be adopted only after a government 
conclusion. Under the constitution the approval "retroactively" 
of presidential edicts is permitted in just two cases: on the 
introduction of martial law and a state of emergency. Does this 
mean that a state of emergency has been secretly introduced in 
the country? 
  I have touched on just two edicts, remarkable for being 
published simultaneously with the new constitution. But the 
same can also be said of many other documents from the 
president's desk: on accelerating agrarian reform, on approving 
the program for the privatization of the mass media, on 
approving the new coat of arms, on eliminating the Ministry of 
Security.... The authority to adopt them was exceeded in every 
case, and they do not conform with either the former or the new 
constitution. 
  If anyone had any illusions that law and order would 
finally be established in the country with the adoption of the 
new constitution, he will, alas, have to abandon them. The 
fresh-baked constitution has been violated by its very creators 
from the very first day. To fanfares and toasts in its honor 
the country is continuing to sink into a quagmire of arbitrary 
rule and lawlessness. 
<H5>  Figures Do Not Balance Again </H5>
  I have before me three newspapers from Stavropol Kray: 
STAVROPOLSKAYA PRAVDA for 17 December, the same newspaper for 22 
December, and STAVROPOLSKIYE GUBERNSKIYE VEDOMOSTI for 18 
December. All three publish the results of the elections and 
the referendum in Stavropol Kray, and they are different in all 
three! The list of voters is different, and the number of voting 
papers handed out does not coincide. How could this happen, if 
the same voters voted and all four voting papers were issued 
simultaneously? 
  This is called a "pitchfork." By tying the vote on the 
constitution in with the elections, the organizers of the 
referendum did, of course, secure a considerable number of 
additional votes. But they underestimated the fact that in such 
complex voting it is very difficult to "tidy up the loose ends." 
Whereas the referendum was held practically without control, the 
candidates' results were closely observed by their numerous 
agents. This was why it took so long for the voting results to 
reach Moscow in dribs and drabs. 
  Of course, the question of the results of the voting in the 
deputies' elections and the referendum on the new constitution 
will be raised both in the press and at sessions of the State 
Duma. It would also be not at all out of place for the Russian 
Federation Prosecutor's Office, which stands guard over the law, 
to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the aforesaid 
facts. On the threshold of an unpleasant discussion on this 
subject the presidential press unobtrusively hints that if the 
results of the referendum on the new constitution are canceled, 
the president in turn will cancel the results of the elections 
to the Federal Assembly. Either the Constitution imposed by 
means of a deception or presidential rule not limited by any 
laws -- this is the poor choice offered Russians today by the 
"Russia's Choice" limited partnership. 
<H5>  There Will Be a Black Obelisk </H5>
  But what about the international observers? Why did several 
hundred very experienced politicians, gathered from all over the 
world, assure the country and the whole world that the elections 
in Russia were held according to the highest standards of 
democracy? 
  This was despite the fact that the elections were preceded 
by 
the shooting up of parliament and the introduction of a state of 
emergency (during which it is forbidden by law to hold 
elections). The elections were held not according to the law but 
according to a statute which was adopted personally by the 
president and was changed repeatedly in the course of the 
elections. A number of public organizations were banned 
illegally, by presidential edict, on the eve of the elections. 
An entire section of the political spectrum -- movements of a 
national-patriotic orientation -- was criminally cut off. The 
opposition press was blocked for practically the whole duration 
of the election campaign. The government made attempts to exert 
crude pressure on electoral associations and individual 
candidates (a ban on campaigning against the constitution, the 
institution of criminal proceedings). Despite the fact that 
foreign observers responded to the question "Would you like such 
elections to be held in your country?" by opening their eyes 
wide and starting to wave their hands in horror. Despite all 
this, the elections and the referendum in Russia were 
acknowledged a model of democracy. Congratulations poured in 
from all over the world.... 
  There can only be one rational explanation for all this. To 
all appearances, the West has decided firmly to categorize 
Russia among the countries to which panhuman notions of legality 
and a rule-of-law state cannot apply: "What can you expect from 
them -- they are savages!" 
  Thank you. We have probably deserved this. But do not take 
it amiss if a tablet is set up in the Russian parliament at some 
time inscribed with the names of those foreign statesmen who 
approved of the shooting up of the Supreme Soviet and applauded 
the shameful machinations over the new Russian Constitution. To 
remind your descendants and ours. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Leader of the Russian Unity and Concord Party Sergey 
Shakhray, MP, said in an interview with Interfax Friday [31 
December] that the consultations between the leaders of the four 
largest parliamentary parties, Liberal Democrats, Russia's 
Choice, Communists and Agrarians, were "an unprincipled deal." 
  In his view, because only 50 percent of the Russian MPs were 
elected on party lists while the others, in electoral districts, 
these talks infringe on the rights of deputies who are not 
members of the four parties. 
  He thinks that reduction of the government headquarters 
might 
"weaken" the government in which he is a vice premier and step 
up the confrontation between the executive and legislative 
branches. 
  He did not rule out the possibility that he, Aleksandr 
Shokhin and some others would not be included in the new 
government.

<F P=106> [Article by Artem Dmitriyev: "Is Duma an Economic Organ?"] </F>
  [Text] The deputies of the new parliament gave a sharply 
negative response to the statement by First Vice Premier 
Vladimir Shumeyko, who defined the Duma as "only the lower 
chamber, which should engage in economic issues." "We should 
not assign the Duma too great a role," the first vice premier 
stressed. And therefore, thus giving up the lower chamber, 
Vladimir Shumeyko has defined a different role for himself, 
laying claim to the post of upper chamber speaker. This 
intention of the first vice premier's has also generated a 
protest from deputies. It has become known to the editorial 
office that representatives of the Urals and Siberia have put 
forward their own nomination for this post. Other groups and 
factions also have their own candidates. So far no agreement 
has been reached on this issue. 
  This is not the first time recently that Vladimir Shumeyko 
has made statements which have met with a noisy response. There 
was a lot of noise over the statement which he addressed on the 
eve of the elections to the Central Electoral Commission. The 
first vice premier suggested removing from the register, that is 
in fact eliminating from participation in the elections, the 
parties and blocs criticizing the draft Constitution. As we 
know the Central Electoral Commission rejected this appeal and 
confirmed its decision in conjunction with the arbitration court 
not to allow the violation of legislation on elections. 
  It is also worth recalling that when the first vice premier 
held the post of minister of press and information the 
government adopted Decree No. 1233, which inflicted the most 
irreparable blow to freedom of speech and essentially led to the 
suspension of the publication of almost all newspapers and 
journals. Participation in such actions will hardly lend clout 
to the well-known politician who occupies a key position in the 
top echelons of power.

<F P=106> [Interview with Doctor of Historical Sciences Sergey </F>
Vladimirovich Volkov by O. Bobrakov, under the "Political 
Prognosis" rubric; place and date not given: "It Isn't All 
Gloom: Zhirinovskiy Will Not Be President and The Communists 
Will Not Return to Power"] 
  [Text] At times of trouble people readily turn to all 
sorts of prophets -- from astrologists to those who read the 
future from playing cards. Today's guest, Doctor of Historical 
Sciences Sergey Vladimirovich Volkov, does not resort to 
supernatural forces. Nevertheless, his predictions are 
distinguished by their remarkable accuracy. 
  His opinions have usually been at variance with the chorus 
of 
commentators and "forecasters" of the most diverse views. 
Admittedly, his predictions are not widely known because, being 
"different" from everyone, he appeared most often in 
small-circulation publications and until recently, like a 
dissident of the Brezhnev era, he has been published mostly in 
foreign emigre newspapers. 
  Back in January-February 1991, when everyone began talking 
about Gorbachev's "coup" (some in exultation, others in panic), 
he claimed that such a thing was impossible, that the country's 
disintegration was just a few months away, and that after the 
transfer of real power by Gorbachev into the hands of the 
republic authorities he would inevitably become redundant and be 
dropped. Despite the widespread convictions that "the Army will 
not let itself and the country be destroyed" he was sure that it 
could not do anything about it. 
  At the end of 1991, when everyone, including experts from 
the 
CIA, was expecting -- some with fear, others with hope -- that a 
"social explosion" would follow the release of prices, he 
expressed the conviction that Yeltsin could sleep easy in his 
bed because the Communists' hopes of coming to power at the head 
of a "people's uprising" were absolutely groundless. 
Conversely, at the time of the complete "obedience" of the vice 
president and the Supreme Soviet, the author of this forecast 
said that the real danger to the regime could only come from a 
section of its own structures which would form a compact with 
the opposition or evolve into national-bolsheviks. 
  [Bobrakov] Nevertheless, Sergey Vladimirovich, why are your 
forecasts so astonishingly accurate? After all, you predicted 
the results of the elections to the Federal Assembly with an 
accuracy of within 5 percent. 
  [Volkov] To assess a specific political situation you simply 
have to know, first, how in principle people of a certain 
outlook will behave in situations of a certain type and second, 
what that given person's outlook is and what that type of 
situation is. I cannot know a great many specific situations 
(because I am not one of the "initiated") but if I have at least 
60 percent of the significant information for any given 
situation I can hardly go wrong. You have to know how to 
compare reliable facts, which by no means everyone can do 
properly, not even those who possess the full set of 
information. The most important thing here is not to succumb to 
emotion or to extrapolate from one's own political preferences, 
something which more than 90 percent of people who presume to 
judge events are clearly incapable of doing. 
  [Bobrakov] What role does your profession as an historian 
play in the way that you view the situation? I have heard, by 
the way, that you were virtually the youngest ever doctor of 
historical sciences.... 
  [Volkov] That is probably right. I defended my thesis 
when I was 34, but I am a historian mainly in terms of my way of 
thinking. History for me has been a natural pastime since 
childhood. It contains the key to the understanding of all 
things. After all, people have not changed in millennia.... 
But I became a professional historian quite by chance. As a 
writer once said, "I wrote simply because the sorry times 
prevented me from acting." 
  [Bobrakov] You correctly predicted the results of the 
elections to the Federal Assembly. How did you envisage the 
breakdown of social forces in the country in mid-December? Did 
any surprises emerge for you in this respect during the voting? 
  [Volkov] It was quite obvious 12-18 months ago that in any 
even remotely free elections the greatest chance of success 
would belong to those who are associated with the "third force," 
that is, neither the "democrats" nor the "Communists." The 
organizers of the elections did everything possible to prevent 
the participation in the elections of those parties which could 
have a real claim to that kind of image. The requirement to 
collect 100,000 signatures in just two-three weeks was aimed 
precisely against them because those parties were still very 
weak organizationally or had only recently been created. 
Consequently, the only contender for the role of the "purely 
patriotic" party was the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia 
[LDPR] which won the votes of all those who did not want to vote 
either for the democrats or the Communists. Some people thought 
that if the patriotic idea seemed to be a base caricature people 
would not vote for it. These were vain expectations. The very 
idea is so natural and appealing that they even voted for the 
caricature. The argument "down with everyone" was fairly 
widespread. 
  I have always said (including in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA a year 
ago) that the patriotic idea would sooner or later prevail, its 
victory was inevitable because it is at the basis of any normal 
statehood. And if the present regime cannot identify itself with 
it, someone else will do so and, furthermore, the best chance 
will belong to those who are customarily called the 
"red-browns." What is surprising about that: If you do not 
want to be patriots yourselves, if you say nothing and prevent 
the "civilized" patriots from appearing "in public" -- well, 
that is how you get Zhirinovskiy.... 
  The LDPR's "own" constituency comprises not more than 10 
percent and not less than 5 percent, the rest has been handed to 
it by the authorities. There are no surprises here. The 
democrats' tactics -- to run in several blocs rather than 
pooling everything with Gaydar and his "Choice" -- produced the 
expected success. Had they pooled everything with Gaydar, such 
a unified bloc would have hardly gained more that 30 percent of 
the votes; but in the event they gained twice as much because a 
sufficient number of people were successfully persuaded that the 
other democratic parties were something different from the 
extremely unpopular "mainstream" democrats. (One of the most 
comical results have been the expressions of regrets about the 
"split" among democrats.) Yeltsin himself is one thing, the 
"democrats" are something quite different. Yeltsin would win a 
presidential election right now, because he enjoys the support 
of about 30 percent of the total population and of about 40-50 
percent of those who go to vote. Without Yeltsin, the 
"democrats" can count on just about 20 percent of the total 
population and on about one-third of its active section, but 
when the question of the threat of communist restoration is 
raised, this number may double because the overwhelming majority 
of the population are, of course, in principle "in favor of 
reforms" (but not in favor of "the democrats"). But 
Zhirinovskiy is also in favor of reforms.... 
  [Bobrakov] What political maneuvers can be expected in the 
immediate future from the leaders of parties and movements? 
What will be the final disposition of forces in the new 
parliament? What will be the future of parliament in general? 
  [Volkov] This is not a very interesting subject to discuss 
because, under the Constitution which was adopted (thanks, 
incidentally, to Zhirinovskiy), parliament will hardly mean 
anything. There will be a lot of noise, there will be 
merriment, and many are already preparing for some decent 
amusement. It is obvious that, without the LDPR, the Communists 
will be unable to block a single decision. As regards the LDPR 
itself, provided it displays loyalty to Yeltsin (unless he 
behaves the way the mass media did in the first few days after 
the elections), Zhirinovskiy is hardly likely to fall out with 
the president. So far he has been on Yeltsin's side at the most 
critical times -- on the question of disbanding the Supreme 
Soviet, on the question of the Constitution -- and people prefer 
to bashfully "overlook" this. 
  As a matter of fact, Yeltsin gained the most from the 
election results. Some people were getting ready to write him 
off and contest the presidential seat, but now it is obvious 
that they would not get anywhere without him, he remains their 
sole protection. 
  Of course, not a single democrat would be willing to 
cooperate with the LDP, but this is what will happen objectively 
if they want to pursue the reforms and if the reforms are indeed 
the main issue for them. The Communists will be against, 
whatever happens. There are virtually no issues on which the 
democrats could unite with today's Communists against the LDPR. 
But there is nothing to prevent Zhirinovskiy uniting with the 
reds. And he will certainly do so if the campaign against the 
LDPR does not cease. 
  [Bobrakov] How about trying to look a little further into 
the future? How do you, in general outline, imagine the 
development of the system of the country's political 
administration, and the future of Russia as a whole? 
  [Volkov] I am convinced that if Russia remains in existence 
it will, sooner or later, return to the path of natural 
development, and that legal continuity as regards historical 
Russia will be restored. 
  Proper political activity is only just beginning. Genuine 
figures and parties, unassociated with the Soviet past, are only 
just emerging. I do not think that they could be "benched" for 
any length of time in the conditions of a normal democratic 
process. After the third of fourth election they will succeed in 
gaining a fitting place in the political spectrum and will 
determine Russia's state development. They do not even have to 
win the majority of votes -- if we assume that the "democratic 
Russians" win 40 percent and the "red-browns" win another 40 
percent, the decision in each specific instance will actually 
depend on the remaining 20 percent. 
  But if this process is thwarted and an "executive authority" 
remains in power over the next 15-20 years, the return to the 
natural path of development will be secured by someone from that 
environment (maybe even faster than through the sequence of 
parliamentary elections). Because, as a rule, the realization 
of the need for such a return dawns more quickly on would-be 
"autocrats" and the victor is the one who manages to effect it 
earlier and more successfully. 
  At the risk of dissociating myself from the panic chorus, I 
would dare to assert that Zhirinovskiy will never become 
president and the LDPR will never gain more than 30-40 percent 
of the votes, just as the Communists will never regain power 
peacefully, running under their own name. 
  At present, there are three possible options: 
  1. The presidential power will learn the lesson it has been 
taught, it will realize what are the population's more or less 
true feelings, and it will find it better to evolve in the 
direction of more appropriately meeting the country's state 
interests, without letting itself be overtaken by the 
"patriotic" horse. 
  2. It will succumb to pressure from the "democratic 
Russians" and will ostentatiously back the bankrupt "Russia's 
Choice" as the sole "correct" party, bringing itself face to 
face with the need to disband parliament again, considerably 
reducing in the process its chances of enjoying the Army's 
support in the event of fresh actions by national-bolsheviks. 
  3. It will let the radical democrats in parliament sort 
themselves out with the LDPR and the Communists, while it relies 
on pragmatic-patriotic elements in the government. 
  The third option is most likely to succeed, because at 
present the government circles contain the largest number of 
realistic people whose position was also objectively 
consolidated as a result of the elections, and there has been a 
significant enhancement of their role as a balancing force.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Speranskiy, independent expert, under the </F>
"Parliament" rubric: "A Structure That Will Not Work. A Few 
Bureaucratic Puzzles"] 
  [Text] "I feel sorry for this parliament" is what one is 
tempted to exclaim, rephrasing Vereshchagin from "The White Sun 
of the Desert" [a Russian customs officer from a movie about the 
civil war set in Central Asia, who keeps saying "I feel sorry 
for this State"], as one looks at the provisional structure of 
the Russian Federation Federal Assembly's staff. Under the 
current Russian Federation Constitution, the parliament's 
chambers are completely independent of each other in their 
activity. For unknown reasons, however, the chambers' staffs 
turned out to be directly subordinated to the chief of staff of 
the Federal Assembly, and also to his deputies. Also 
effectively subordinated to the chief of staff are the reception 
rooms of the Federation Council's and the State Duma's chiefs, 
along with all staff structures of the Federal Assembly in 
general. To whom the chief of staff is subordinated and by whom 
he is appointed, the above structure does not clarify. 
  But this is only half of the trouble. The parliament is 
completely devoid of analytical services. The staff's entire 
activity for the most part boils down to purely technical 
processing of documents. This is what will be the main scope of 
the Information-Technological Support Administration's activity, 
which accounts for over half of the staff's personnel -- 272 
people. What do the administration's services include? A 
Department of Document Turnover Support. What is hidden behind 
this sophisticated name is the old general department, well 
known from ministers' staffs and other organizations, with those 
same old functions. A Protocol Department, in charge of the 
purely technical procedure of registering parliamentary 
documents. An Information-Technical Department, primarily 
servicing electronic voting systems. What is the reason for 
bringing the above departments together, given that both 
chambers plan to have their own registers of clerical work and 
their own voting systems? It is not clear. However, there will 
be yet more unclear matters. The Information-Technological 
Support Administration is an eclectic mixture of services 
diverse in their objectives and functions. They include 
libraries, the editorial- printing department, the department of 
control and verification, and so forth. Why should they have 
been brought together under one administration chief? It would 
be logical to presume that someone needed yet another 
high-ranking office, and badly so. A faint hint of a semblance 
of an information-expert service -- the Information-Legal 
Department, which is part of the same administration -- has only 
19 staffers. This is for a Federal Assembly with over 600 
deputies. Apparently, the department's work will be as 
"effective" as that of another division, the International 
Cooperation Department, designed to provide support for the 
deputy corps' international contacts, with a staff of 20 people. 
It is obviously planned that it will be made up only of 
geniuses. This is unlikely because geniuses have already been 
absorbed by commercial businesses, but given that the 
International Cooperation Department is an integral part of the 
secretariat of the Federal Assembly's chief of staff, it will be 
able to forge international ties for its chief even at this 
strength. What will be more difficult, however, is to do so for 
the deputies. 
  Let us proceed further along the wiring diagram. A 
Development Administration is to be set up. I wonder what or 
whom it is going to develop? And so forth. 
  Most important, the total number of the staff's personnel is 
set at 537 people. There is no need to argue that this is 
clearly not enough. Apparently, the architects of this 
structure proceeded from the desire to save as much Russian 
taxpayers' money as possible by cutting down on the staff. One 
can recommend yet another method of saving to them -- not to 
create a staff at all. All the more so because given its 
numbers and its structure, the staff will be simply unable to 
give deputies any substantive support in performing their duties 
provided for in the new Constitution. 
  A deputy has the right to retain three aides, who, according 
to the concept, must work at a committee on which the deputy is 
sitting, and, accordingly, in his faction and his district. It 
is they who will have to conduct the bulk of analytical and 
other studies. Isn't it too much of a good thing? 
  It is clear that deputies cannot do with this number of 
aides, especially when they deal with narrowly professional 
subjects. In our view, it is essential to set up faction staffs 
and to create secretariats of sorts in committees and 
commissions with organizational and technical functions, while 
leaving analytical studies to the factions. It is also 
necessary to set up specialized research divisions of the entire 
parliament capable of conducting politically neutral and 
objective analyses of subjects under discussion. It would also 
be important to set up deputy commissions supervising the 
activity of both the chambers' joint staff and the staff of the 
entire parliament. 
  The above structure is provisional in its very name. I wish 
its time would pass faster, for, as the ancients used to say, 
there is nothing more permanent than the temporary.

<F P=106> ["Statement of the Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms </F>
Electoral Association"] 
  [Text] The Russian Movement for Democratic Reforms [RMDR] 
expresses sincere thanks to the voters who cast their votes for 
the movement's federal list. 
  The RMDR thanks those independent candidates and 
representatives of the Russian Free Labor Party and other public 
associations and trade unions who agreed to contest the 
elections together with it. 
  The movement expresses special gratitude to its activists 
who 
bore the full burden of the election campaign on their shoulders 
and also to those entrepreneurs who supported the RMDR with 
their financial resources. 
  The movement cordially congratulates all Russians whatever 
their political persuasions on the new year, 1994, and sincerely 
wishes them peace, harmony, happiness, and prosperity. 
  Russia has had a referendum and its first multiparty 
elections. 
  We are satisfied that the voters approved the state's new 
Constitution, which is what the RMDR actively urged the 
country's citizens to do. 
  The elections to the Federal Assembly are of no less 
significance. For the first time in many years the 
representative power in the state has become directly dependent 
on the will and opinions of millions of voters. 
  The historic significance of these events should not be 
underestimated. 
  Undoubtedly, the lack of experience of multiparty elections 
in society was bound to have an impact on the results of the 
voting. However, this cannot be an excuse for the attacks on 
democracy on the part of those political forces which were 
unhappy with the election results. 
  Our movement assesses the results of the elections in a 
balanced and sober way. By operating alone in the election 
marathon the RMDR could not surmount the 5-percent barrier and 
will be represented in the State Duma only by deputies elected 
in single-seat districts. But the more than 2 million votes 
cast for the movement's federal list are eloquent testimony to 
the fact that in its less than two years' existence the RMDR has 
become an influential political force in Russia. 
  Looking to the future with confidence, the RMDR openly and 
honestly tells all the voters in the country that neither the 
platforms of the progovernment election blocs nor the platforms 
of the opposition forces will resolve Russia's pressing 
problems. Thus the most urgent task today is to elaborate a 
platform for transformations meeting the interests of the 
majority of the country's citizens. 
  We urge all democratic forces not connected with the 
government to begin talks on the coordination of a single new 
reform platform -- the "Democratic Alternative." 
  The people must know that not all democrats see the solution 
to the crisis through mass bankruptcies, unemployment, the 
depreciation of savings, the selling off of plants and stores on 
the cheap, disregard of the problems of preserving Russia's 
scientific and technical potential and saving its culture, and 
kowtowing to the West. 
  The people must also know that they are not rigidly 
restricted in their choice solely to the following alternatives: 
a futile return to the past; a set of secuctively simple but 
unrealistic and often very dangerous solutions; or an improved 
course of shock therapy. 
  Those 50 million voters who did not take part in the present 
elections and whose votes may decide the outcome of future 
elections must surely know that too.

  [Text] As the State Duma goes into its first session on 
January 11, the Liberal Democrats intend to press for general 
amnesty to any one sentenced on political or economic charges 
starting from April 15, 1985, LDP [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia] leaders said in Moscow on Friday [31 December]. 
  The LDP which won over 20 percent of the vote in this 
month's 
elections, more than any other party, will hold 60 seats in the 
new Russian parliament. 
  The LDP proposes that the trial over members of the 1991 
coup 
attempt be ceased and criminal charges lifted against anyone 
taking part in this October's events including the siege and 
defence of the White House and other facilities. 
  It also wants leaders of the parliamentary revolt, now at 
Moscow's Lefortovo prison, to be placed under house arrest with 
some of them barred from any political activity for a period of 
three years. 
  The measure must be seen as a step on the way to public 
unity, the LDP statement says.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor M. Reshetnikov and analyst V. Vasilyev </F>
under the "Analytical Research" rubric: "Democracy. 
National-Populism. Extremism. Fascism? Problems of Spiritual 
Leadership"] 
  [Excerpts] Facts: Known and Hypothetical. 
Historical Notes, No. 1 
  Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy was born 25 April 1946 in 
the 
capital of Kazakhstan, Alma-Ata (now Almaty), to the family of 
an office worker; he was the family's sixth child (his father 
died the same year). He graduated from a Russian school with 
rather a high standard of teaching for the Central Asian 
republic; during his education he displayed special aptitude for 
foreign languages. His personality developed in conditions where 
the indigenous population took priority in socioeconomic matters 
and Russians suffered relative discrimination in the 
national-territorial formations. (This was the so-called 
Leninist nationalities policy, the essence of which was to 
artificially maintain privileges for the indigenous population 
of the republics of the USSR in their historical territories, as 
camouflage for a strategic goal which was never openly 
proclaimed -- "nonviolent creeping" Russification). He is a 
Russophile by conviction and mentality. 
  He graduated from the Moscow State University Institute of 
Oriental Languages (diploma with distinction) and later the 
Moscow State University Law Faculty (evening studies 
department); he speaks four foreign languages. He himself 
believes his personality was formed by the age of 21. In the 
senior grades he was described as a rather "obstinate young man." 
  During his studies at the Institute he spent a period in 
Turkey, where he was involved in an incident with the police in 
connection with his distributing badges depicting Soviet 
symbols. After graduating from the Institute he served in the 
Army, in the Transcaucasus Military District. On completing his 
service, he returned to Moscow. He worked at the Soviet 
Committee for the Defense of Peace, and later at the office of 
the dean for work with foreign students at the higher school of 
the trade union movement, at the Foreign Law Collegium, and at 
the "Mir" Publishing House (as a legal consultant). In the 
Soviet period all the above posts were filled, as a rule, by a 
specific type of minion, although there were exceptions. He has 
no experience of state, administrative, economic, or management 
activity. 
  He is married, with a grown-up son, lives with his family in 
a two-room cooperative apartment, and his personal car is a 
Moskvich. 
  His critical attitude toward Soviet life began to develop 
after the age of 30. In the period of "perestroyka" he was 
sympathetic to the activity of M. Gorbachev and, later, B. 
Yeltsin. It is to this period that he dates his first signs of 
dissatisfaction with the reformers' activities and the awakening 
of the desire for active political work and for power (1990). 
He is not acquainted with the burden of power and 
responsibility, his actual administrative potential is not 
known, so the motive behind his desire for power may be assumed 
to be the desire for self-fulfillment, which, combined with a 
marked inclination to express opinions in a peremptory manner, 
could, if that desire was fulfilled, create a situation of 
dangerous unpredictability in his decisions of authority. 
  He is organizer and chairman (since 31 March 1991) of the 
Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union (the LDPR [Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia], after the breakup of the USSR), 
which, unlike other party formations in Russia, has ancient 
Russian traditions and parallels in virtually all the developed 
countries of the world. In view of V.V. Zhirinovskiy's lack of 
any previous political experience, it appears highly dubious 
that the idea of forming this party arose spontaneously. 
  He is inclined toward a certain arrogance, unconventional 
behavior, and political risk-taking. In 1991 he was nominated 
by the LDPR as candidate for the post of president of the RSFSR; 
under the legislation existing at that time whereby candidates 
could be registered either by collecting 100,000 signatures or 
on the basis of a vote of deputies of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet. 
He chose the latter option for nomination and, to everyone's 
surprise, received 477 votes, which amounted to more than 50 
percent of those present and was more than twice the number 
necessary to achieve nomination (213 votes). According to the 
participants in the vote, who were themselves stunned by these 
results, he impressed them by the absolutely fascinating 
unconventionality of his expressions and opinions and his 
"almost magical effect," a "fusion" of shocking peremptoriness, 
extreme radicalism, and unabashed self-publicity. In May 1991 
the mass media described him as "an entirely unknown candidate 
as yet." He had not formerly belonged to any political 
organization or participated in elected soviet organs. At the 
same time he was mentioned in certain narrow circles as one of 
the authors of the program of the "Democratic Union," of which 
he was never officially a member. 
  In the elections for RSFSR president he received 6.2 million 
votes. Defeated, he announced his decision immediately to start 
his next election campaign, and has consistently implemented 
that decision since 1991, systematically addressing various 
population groups at rallies, in labor collectives, at higher 
educational establishments, etc. (As a result he was certainly 
the best prepared -- both in terms of practical experience, and 
methodologically -- for "surprise" parliamentary elections). He 
is a master of the art of persuasion and polemics. The sources 
of finance for a rather prolonged election campaign are unknown. 
  By political conviction he is a "liberal democrat" and an 
advocate of authoritarianism ("tough" power), including in 
foreign policy (while at the same time ostentatiously 
dissociating himself from totalitarianism, which it is hard to 
reconcile with his well-known public statements, for instance: 
"...If I become president, the Estonians will be satisfied. 
Those who are not satisfied will leave -- for Sweden, 
Finland..."). According to his official statements, which are 
also hard to identify with the theses put forward in his public 
utterances, he considers himself an opponent of anticommunism 
and an antifascist. (Two mutually exclusive illustrations: 1. 
"For me, fascism is the most repulsive thing. Almost all of my 
father's family was shot by the fascists..." 2. "Everything will 
go to the devil, because the Russian people will take revenge 
for all those years of desecrated life, for the genocide, for 
all the humiliations"). He declares his commitment to the ideas 
of the convergence of various socioeconomic systems; he does not 
share the values of either socialism or capitalism. He has a 
complex about the "nationalities question," rooted in his early 
childhood. (From his school years: "...The Russian kids come 
crying. If he answers the question, he gets two marks. If a 
Kazakh answers -- the same question, the same preparation -- he 
gets four"; and another well-known example: "My mother was a 
Russian, my father was a lawyer"). 
  In international relations he is inclined toward 
unpredictable political extremism. (Asked how he would tackle 
the problem of our prisoners of war held in Pakistan, he 
replied: "I will call the Pakistani envoy and give him 72 
hours. If our Russian boys do not arrive at Sheremetyevo 
airport within the 72 hours, I will send the Pacific Fleet to 
the shores of Pakistan, and it will start by wiping Karachi off 
the face of the earth"). 
  Attitude toward the family: He advocates restoring the 
patriarchal way of life and minimizing women's participation in 
public life and production work: "We would like to create a 
system of relations in which the man will be the head of the 
family." Also characteristic is the answer he gave when asked 
whom the LDPR is nominating for parliament: "99 percent men." 
  State program: Equality of all forms of ownership; an 
adaptable tax policy; assistance for production; state 
incentives for the creation of new jobs and restrictions on 
middlemen; abolition of national-territorial formations and the 
principles of promotion on ethnic grounds; restoration of the 
administrative division of Russia into governorates, which was 
introduced by Peter I and existed until 1924; and deletion of 
the "nationality" section from all documents, with everyone 
retaining equal rights to freedom of movement and the right to 
elect and be elected, to preserve and develop the national 
culture, and to decide for oneself on one's allegiance to a 
given culture (nation). 
  A point worthy of special mention is that of the 
expediency of maintaining a certain minimum level of 
unemployment as an incentive to ensure the maximum work 
capacity, reduce personnel turnover, and counteract strike 
activities by working people. He is a supporter of lockouts 
(the closure of enterprises and mass dismissal of workers in the 
event of strikes) and of encouraging strikebreaking (ending 
strikes by hiring workers who may be less skilled, but are more 
moderate in their demands). 
  On territorial problems, he has repeatedly put forward an 
idea that is irresponsible in present conditions, that of 
restoring a unified Russia within the 1975 borders (on the basis 
of the 1975 Helsinki agreement on the inviolability of the 
borders of states party to the agreement), which can only be 
assessed as total political extremism, failing to take account 
of the changed military-political realities and fraught with the 
threat of the outbreak of a series of local wars or even a new 
world war. 
  He is opposed to loans or the acceptance of any form of 
financial aid from the West. In 1991 he stated that in the 
event of his being elected president he would repay no debts to 
anyone: "Let those who borrow, pay" (the Leninist version of 
nonrecognition of debts). In the light of this statement 
(unless it is disavowed) and the LDPR's success in the 
elections, major changes in the West's financial and investment 
policy toward Russia can be predicted in the near future. 
  He is a consistent advocate of unlimited power for the 
president, to whom the government (divorced from politics) is 
entirely subordinate and accountable. He participated actively 
in the drafting of Russia's new (1993) Constitution, 
demonstrating a constructive and sensible approach that came as 
a surprise to many other participants in this work. 
  He deems it expedient to ban all types of political activity 
for a "transitional period." 
  The party's program statements and V.V. Zhirinovskiy's 
personal statements are in most cases effectively incompatible. 
  Political sympathies: Historically, Peter I. Social base 
and support groups: The military-industrial complex, the Army, 
the impoverished section of the former Soviet middle class, 
pensioners, a section of the working class, Russians in the 
nearby foreign countries, young people. 
  Individual characteristics: He has undoubted linguistic 
ability; he is resourceful, sharp-witted, and extremely 
emotional; he easily makes contact with any audience; he is an 
excellent orator and improviser; his public utterances are 
generally provocative; he tends toward metaphorical thinking and 
terse, short sentences; he has a unique personal image and a 
high capacity mentally to "infect" his audience; he is extremely 
self-confident, with a pronounced desire for recognition, 
insatiable self-esteem, and a high opinion of himself; he is 
uncritical, often to the point of irresponsibility; he virtually 
always speaks in the first person and never cites other 
authorities; his preferred conversational style is imperious. 
He has the capacity to transform himself with artistic 
virtuosity. His capacity for work is high. 
  He has repeatedly demonstrated a unique political intuition 
and a capacity to make unerring predictions whose sources can 
only be guessed at. Three weeks before the RSFSR presidential 
elections, he announced: "I will come third" (and he did come 
third, with 7.8 percent, whereas virtually all the analytical 
centers were predicting 0.5 percent); two weeks before the State 
Duma elections, he stated: "We will get 24 percent of the 
votes, not 6 percent, as some people say... There will be six 
factions in parliament: `Russia's Choice,' the agrarians, the 
`Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin' faction, Shakhray's party, the 
Communists, and us." (SANKT-PETERBURGSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, 24 
November 1993). The figures were predicted with absolute 
accuracy, and the list of blocs omitted two which only collected 
the necessary minimum with difficulty. 
  He participated actively in the drafting of the new Russian 
Federation Constitution and in the mass campaign for its 
adoption. 
  He has repeatedly been the target of attempts to discredit 
him; among other things, he was said to be a KGB agent 
(officially refuted by the KGB in a special statement on 28 
August 1991). In the election period he was in effect beyond 
the criticism of the main parties and blocs, and since the 
elections he has been described in a number of the mass media 
and in statements by political figures as a fascist. [passage 
omitted defining liberalism as historical tradition, chronicling 
development of political turmoil which set tone of election 
campaign] 
Historical Notes, No. 3 
  Populism: A transitional type of political 
consciousness which emerges at turning points in history, when 
the old (obsolete) foundations have already been destroyed but 
the new ones have yet to be formed. The first mention (the 
movement of the "populares [people's party]") goes back to the 
first and second centuries B.C. and is characterized by the 
expression of the interests of the common people (the plebs) by 
the nobility (the sympathetic aristocracy). It was revived in 
the United States in the late 19th century in the form of the 
Populist Party. 
  Its chief sign is the emergence of populist figures, whose 
typical characteristic is: Direct contact between leaders who 
have a marked capacity to influence people's minds and hearts, 
with an orientation primarily toward the least adaptable (to 
change) social groups, whose vital interests are damaged. 
  Populist thinking is marked by utopian irrationality, 
simplistic pragmatism, an uncritical faith in economic and 
political panaceas (the confidence that one or several simple 
measures can radically change the entire socioeconomic situation 
for the better), and also typical notions of various social 
cataclysms as the consequence of a conspiracy by external forces. 
  In the sphere of political actions, populism takes the form 
of acts of civil disobedience, protests, and "campaigns" 
directed against power structures. 
  Extremism: An adherence to extreme views and 
methods. Political extremism is the desire to achieve an 
objective by the use of the most radical methods, including all 
forms of violence and terror, going beyond the bounds of the 
generally accepted norms and principles of international 
relations. The basis for the development of extremist 
manifestations is provided by various kinds of deformation of 
political structures and institutions, errors and 
miscalculations in the pursuit of ecological, social, or 
nationalities policy, slowness in carrying out urgently needed 
changes, and misdemeanors in the activity of organs responsible 
for economic and legal regulation. 
  Fascism: A political current which emerged during 
a period of socioeconomic crisis in the early 20th century and 
expressed the interests of the most reactionary circles of the 
haute bourgeoisie. It differs from other reactionary 
dictatorships in having broad links with a fairly large active 
section of the population which does not belong to the ruling 
classes, and in having the capacity to mobilize and politically 
galvanize that section of the population in its own interests. 
The chief social base is the petite and moyenne bourgeoisie, 
declasse and criminal elements, and backward strata of the 
working people. Characteristic features: The use of extreme 
forms of violence, state regulation of the economy, chauvinism, 
racism, and nationalist myth-making. 
<H5>  Commentary </H5>
  Anyone who has carefully studied the definitions cited, and 
still more anyone who has directly encountered V.V. 
Zhirinovskiy, will probably agree that the statements of certain 
politicians regarding his fascism are premature at the moment. 
But we have deliberately arranged the above-mentioned 
definitions in a certain order so as to ensure that both the 
origins and the sliding borders between the first, second, and 
third [populism, extremism, and fascism] are sufficiently clear. 
  Russian nationalism, which was silent for so long and of 
which so much has been said in this article, which is -- once 
again -- inherent in and therefore certainly impacts on the main 
bulk of the population, has, in the specific economic conditions 
of the disintegration of the unitary state and the difficulties 
of the transitional period, engendered a fundamentally new 
phenomenon -- national-populism. What it turns into in future 
will of course depend both on our politicians and on the mass 
media, which have yet to show much inclination for considered, 
substantiated assessments. But to an even greater extent its 
hard-to-predict dynamic development will be determined by the 
realism and social orientation of economic and political 
programs, and also by the factor of the population's involvement 
in their implementation in meaningful terms. 
<H5>  Conclusions </H5>
  V.V. Zhirinovskiy is undoubtedly a talented and gifted man, 
but it is absolutely clear to any professional that for all his 
"multifunctionality" and huge capacity for work, it would have 
been beyond his powers single-handedly to tackle simultaneously 
and with such a high degree of skill the program tasks, 
analytical and forecasting tasks, and practical tasks. 
  V.V. Zhirinovskiy, however attractive this simple view may 
seem, is certainly not the puppet of the forces behind him, he 
is an independent and active participant in the process that is 
being pursued, and is clearly and soberly aware of what is going 
on. His role in this process is far from unequivocal, and 
simplistic assessments of that role, including hysterics and the 
pinning of labels, are not permissible. 
  Unlike the very serious and highly significant, but as yet 
unconfirmed, information on Operation "Werewolf" [said to be 
Zhirinovskiy's election campaign plan], statements about some 
kind of special hypnotic technique simply do not stand up to 
criticism. It is simultaneously far simpler and far more complex 
than that.

<F P=106> [Report on decision adopted by 29 December meeting of </F>
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI journalists collective: "Our Newspaper's 
Journalists Are Now ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's Founders Themselves"] 
  [Text] Yesterday there was a meeting of the journalists 
collective at the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI editorial office. After 
discussing the situation which has developed in relations 
between the newspaper and its founder, the former Council of 
Ministers of the Russian Federation, the meeting adopted the 
following decision: 
  On 23 December 1993 B. Yeltsin, president of the Russian 
Federation, signed Edict No. 2277 "On the Transformation and 
Reorganization of the Council of Ministers-Government of the 
Russian Federation." Part four of Article 18 of the Russian 
Federation Law "On the Mass Media" says that "in the event of 
the abolition or reorganization of the founder -- an association 
of citizens, enterprise, institution, or state organ -- the 
founder's rights and duties shall pass in their entirety to the 
editorial office unless otherwise specified by the charter of 
the editorial office." The Interim Charter of the editorial 
office which is in force at the present moment makes no other 
provision. 
  The meeting states that the former Council of Ministers of 
the Russian Federation, as founder of the newspaper, has not 
fulfilled its statutory obligations with regard to assisting the 
work of the editorial office and providing it with information 
at its disposal. On the contrary, the chief editor and 
journalists have been impeded in the performance of their 
professional duty by workers of the government apparatus. In 
particular, the decree on the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI editorial 
office, which would have enabled it to work normally, and the 
new editorial charter have been held up within that apparatus 
for a long time now. Attempts are being made to get rid of an 
editor who is proving unsuitable. Criticism of the government 
will not be accepted. It has reached the point where certain 
apparatus workers have stated that the newspaper is 
"antigovernment." On the other hand, while remaining formally a 
government publication, the newspaper was considerably 
restricted in its actions, and the image of being an obedient 
semi-official publication, albeit an unjust image, had an 
adverse effect on its standing. 
  The meeting considers that by becoming an independent 
publication but preserving in full the newspaper's profile as an 
all-Russia daily which covers questions of Russia's state life 
first and foremost, keep readers informed about the actions of 
the authorities, and monitors them on society's behalf, 
ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI will be able to perform its social role 
considerably more freely and professionally. 
  On that basis the meeting of the journalists collective of 
the editorial office resolves: 
  1 That in connection with the reorganization of the founder 
of the newspaper and on the basis of part four of Article 18 of 
the Russian Federation Law "On the Mass Media," the newspaper's 
editorial office in the form of its journalists collective shall 
be considered the founder of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. 
  2. That the "Interim Charter of the Editorial Office of the 
RSFSR Council of Ministers weekly ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI," which has 
operated since February 1991, shall be considered inoperative. 
  3. That a new charter is to be adopted for the editorial 
office of the sociopolitical daily newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. 
  4. That the newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI is to be registered 
at the Ministry of the Press and Information (the Committee for 
the Press) with its editorial office as founder. 
  5. The Ministry of the Press and Information (the Committee 
for the Press) is to be asked to approve the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
editorial office Charter. 
  6. The decision of the journalists collective of 21 December 
1993 on confidence in ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI chief editor V.N. Kucher 
is to be confirmed. 
  [signed] P. Shinkarenko, chairman of the meeting 
  N. Kudryashov, secretary 
  [Dated] 29 December 1993 
  [The back-page box of editorial information in the 31 
December edition includes the notation "Founder: The 
Journalists Collective of the Editorial Office"; referent item 
explains how 29 December edition dropped the "Founder: Council 
of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation" notation 
which had been present prior to that date]

<F P=106> [By correspondent V. Skvortsov including recorded remarks by </F>
V. Kucher, editor in chief of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI; from the 
"Vesti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Skvortsov] Without waiting for New Year's eve, when 
the old and unnecessary are thrown away, our fellow journalists 
at the newspaper ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI have freed themselves from 
the intrusive stewardship of their masters, the Council of 
Ministers. 
  [Kucher] I will be honest about this. We have taken 
advantage of an edict by President Boris Yeltsin about 
reorganizing the government, and which has brought us an 
unexpected New Year's present. According to Clause 4 of Article 
18 of the Law on the Press, if a founder is reorganized, then 
all rights are transferred to its successor at the newspaper, 
which is the work force. 
  We held a meeting of journalists yesterday, and we became 
founders of the newspaper. We are profoundly convinced that if 
Russia is becoming a truly democratic state, then there should 
be no newspapers speaking in the name of the state or newspapers 
working under the diktat of any state authorities. Newspapers 
should perform another vital function: Supervision of the 
authorities by society. 
  [Skvortsov] They plan to solve the problem of finance 
themselves, with only part coming from the state budget. 
  [Kucher] We were not building up a newspaper business. We 
felt like a castrated tom cat in the hands of a rich boss. 
  [Skvortsov] We will find out the government's reaction to 
this breakaway next year.

<F P=106> [Report by Vadim Gorshenin: "PRAVDA Prepared To Join </F>
Strike"] 
  [Text] After the destruction of the Supreme Soviet and the 
abolition of the Security Ministry it is the press' turn to face 
heavy shelling. If the Chernomyrdin government decree is 
fulfilled prices for newspapers will increase substantially. 
Yesterday your PRAVDA correspondent got in touch with Ivan 
Laptev, president of the association of chief editors and 
publishers. 
  "I should like to draw the attention of PRAVDA employees and 
readers," Ivan Dmitriyevich stated. "It is not a case of 
dependent or independent publications -- it was a case of the 
economic stifling of the entire press. And unless the president 
and government repeal decree no. 1233, then soon we shall have 
only memories of the press. Incidentally, I should like to note 
that the decision which has been taken discredits the new 
Constitution, especially article 29." 
  For our readers' information. PRAVDA, like many other 
Russian newspapers, states its readiness also to suspend the 
production of its publication from 10 through 17 January in 
protest against one more government pogrom.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Shelikhov, deputy general director </F>
of the Russian Federation Federal Postal Communications 
Administration, by Ruslan Ignatyev; place and date not given: 
"Subscription-94 Results Summarized"] 
  [Text] The subscription campaign for newspapers and 
magazines for the first half of 1994 has ended. ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA correspondent Ruslan Ignatyev asked Vladimir Shelikhov, 
deputy general director of the Russian Federation Federal Postal 
Communications Administration, to talk about its final results. 
  Subscriptions for the first half of 1994 amounted to over 
61.5 million copies of various publications. This represents 
73.5 percent of the figure for the first half of 1993. In the 
opinion of Russian Communications Ministry specialists, the 
crisis of the press is over and it is not anticipated that 
subscriptions will fall to a low level in the future. 
  The structure of the present subscription is interesting. 
Over half the present total circulation figure is accounted for 
by newspapers -- 43.6 million copies. As we expected, readers 
have shown great interest in local publications -- the latter 
account for 25.2 million copies. The circulation of central 
newspapers is 18.1 million. Local publications have virtually 
maintained their 1993 circulation. Central publications have 
lost one-third of their subscribers. The circulation of 
magazines continues to decline. The level of subscriptions 
there is 95.6 percent of the level for the second half of 1993. 
  Now let us cite figures for subscriptions to the most 
popular 
publications (leaving aside PRAVDA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, and some 
others for which figures will be provided later). 
  ARGUMENTY I FAKTY -- 5.5 million 
  TRUD -- 1.5 million 
  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA -- 1.03 million 
  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA -- 871,000 
  IZVESTIYA -- 435,500 
  PIONERSKAYA PRAVDA -- 134,500 
  MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI -- 120,000 
  LITERATURNAYA GAZETA -- 81,500 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA -- 29,000 
  SEGODNYA -- 15,600 
  NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA -- 15,500 
  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA -- 13,000 
  VEK -- 3,000 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's front-page new year greetings to 
readers 
includes the information that "The number of subscribers to the 
newspaper has increased 12-fold and its circulation will now be 
600,000."]

<F P=106> [Message to readers from Chief Editor Natalya Polezhayeva: </F>
"What Is in Store for You? A Nonfuturologist's Forecast for 
Readers of Our Newspaper"] 
  [Text] As the New Year approaches, it is customary to make 
predictions. This time we will dispense with futurologists, 
fortune-tellers, and psychics. No one apart from us can say 
what is in store for you, our readers, in the pages of 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA in 1994. 
  As an official organ, the newspaper will continue to keep 
you 
acquainted with all official documents -- laws, edicts, decrees, 
directives, and statutes. In the new year this list will grow. 
We plan to print the most important draft legislative acts as 
well as departmental instructions, recommendations [ukazaniye], 
and clarifications. We will begin prompt publication of 
collections of documents in the series entitled "ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA Library" [Biblioteka Rossiyskoy Gazety]. 
  The newspaper will be paying special attention to 
privatization. Beginning in January, two special editions will 
be published at regular intervals with information on investment 
funds and property funds. They will be useful to enterprises, 
entrepreneurs, and ordinary share holders, in other words to all 
of us. In addition, in the new year ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
subscribers in central regions will receive each week a free 
color supplement on special topics. The first will be 
"ROSSIYSKAYA NEDVIZHIMOST" [Russian Real Estate]. 
  The editorial office has concluded a contract with the 
confederation of consumer societies. Together we will keep 
readers informed about commodities (quality and prices), 
services (from consumer services to financial services), water 
and air, and housing (from construction rights to rental 
charges). 
  There will be another weekly newspaper within the newspaper 
wholly dedicated to problems of the economy, business, and 
marketing. 
  Our country is multinational. We often talk about that but 
often forget about it, too. As of the new year, ROSSIYSKAYA 
GAZETA will feature ethnic sections on the culture, daily life, 
language, and history of the peoples inhabiting Russia. 
  The newspaper's Saturday edition will be somewhat different. 
We can hardly produce a 16-page edition (our financial 
potential is not great) but we promise that on Saturdays readers 
will find in their newspapers scoops, scandals, crossword 
puzzles, and everything else which makes for light reading at 
weekends. 
  These are by no means all our plans. We shall compensate our 
subscribers for copies of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA which they did not 
receive in the outgoing year by providing free inserts and 
supplements. 
  We congratulate ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA readers on the New Year! 
We wish you all stability, peace, health, and prosperity.

The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned this from Colonel Yevgeniy 
Znamenskiy, deputy head of the press office of the Russian 
border troops. The edict has been issued in connection with the 
dismantling of the Russian Ministry of Security and in order to 
ensure continuity of command of the Russian border troops. 
  The representative of the press office has also reported 
that 
under the decree, the Federal Border Service-Central Command of 
the Russian border troops is to a have a status equivalent to 
that of a Federal ministry and to operate in direct

<F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Pelts: "Lessons for the Future. </F>
Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev Has Held His 
Traditional Meeting With Journalists"] 
  [Text] As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already reported, this was 
the final meeting of the current year. So there was frank 
discussion about practically all questions of the life and daily 
activity of the Russian Armed Forces. 
  First of all the defense minister stressed that the outgoing 
year of 1993 has certainly been extremely complex for the Army 
from all viewpoints. It has been a year whose lessons require 
the most serious analysis. 
  The most important point is that this year the Army has 
played an important role in preserving Russia's integrity and 
security. Metaphorically speaking, it has had to clear away the 
obstructions created as a result of the political confrontation 
in the country. The Army, Pavel Grachev stressed, wants just one 
thing: the maximum harmony in society and state stability. Any 
other speculations regarding its role in society are 
impermissible and extremely dangerous. 
  In what kind of shape is the Russian Army as it prepares to 
enter the new year of 1994? It is more cohesive and stronger 
than ever. In the outgoing year it proved possible to put a 
stop once and for all to many negative trends and to create good 
groundwork for the future. The reform of the Army, the minister 
stressed, is going according to plan, in a calm workmanlike 
atmosphere. 
  The Russian Army currently has 2.3 million men. Over 
the last 18 months it has decreased by almost 0.5 million. This 
process will continue, but there will be no precipitate 
[obvalnyy] reduction, Grachev stressed. He also advocated that 
the size of the Russian Army be kept at approximately the 
current level, since the earlier parliamentary decision on an 
Army of 1.5 million is clearly at odds with the scale of the 
tasks that it is resolving. 
  This year around 640,000 servicemen, over 30,000 tanks, 
9,000 artillery systems, over 4,000 aircraft and helicopters, 46 
divisions, 64 brigades, and 90 air regiments have been withdrawn 
from the East European countries and nearby foreign lands. The 
withdrawal of troops from Czechoslovakia [as published], 
Hungary, Poland, Mongolia, Lithuania, and Cuba has been 
completed. This process took place within an extremely tight 
time frame, the minister stressed. 
  Concerning questions of troop combat training, Pavel Grachev 
stressed that, despite many difficulties, here too it has been 
possible to retain a planned and systematic approach. The 
necessary training exercises for command personnel have been 
held and command-staff and regional exercises have taken place. 
These showed that the troops are at an adequate level of combat 
readiness and can resolve all the tasks entrusted to them. 
  Of course, the most painful questions in the Army and in 
society as a whole are problems of social protection. But even 
in these conditions, when the Defense Ministry is literally 
having to "fight" to secure everything necessary for the needs 
of the Army and servicemen, it has been possible to do a 
considerable amount. 
  The most important thing is housing, of course. Some 
120,000 servicemen currently need a roof over their heads. The 
Defense Ministry channels 75 percent of the money allocated for 
capital construction into the construction of housing. Through 
its own efforts around 62,000 apartments were constructed in 
1993. This figure will go up by a further 30 percent in the new 
year. In addition, Pavel Grachev named yet another reason why 
it has so far not been possible to solve this extremely acute 
social problem. Local administrations have allocated only 12 
percent of the planned volume of housing. 
  The defense minister devoted much attention to questions of 
manpower acquisition for the forces. After noting the 
difficulties with the draft at the start of this year, he 
stressed that the situation is now more stable. There is still 
a shortage in many units, but the measures that have been taken 
have made it possible to avoid the worst-case forecasts. He 
noted the improvement in the work of military commissariats and 
local administrations in the Transbaykal, Far Eastern, North 
Caucasus, and Volga Military Districts. As of now draft 
manpower levels are 60 percent of what is required. 
  Concerning contract service, the defense minister noted a 
number of difficulties. In his view, it is worrying that 
contract servicemen are more willing to accept posts in the rear 
while there are far fewer who want to go to the front line and 
join combat units. Nevertheless, 123,000 servicemen have now 
signed contracts. This figure will certainly increase in the 
new year. 
  Journalists also wanted to know about Russia's relations 
with 
NATO. 
  "Our relations," the defense minister stressed, "must 
be more meaningful and develop across a broad spectrum of 
collaboration." He also announced the creation of a group of 
experts which is to submit as early as the beginning of 1994 a 
joint plan for military-political and military cooperation 
between Russia and NATO. 
  Army General Pavel Grachev answered many questions from 
journalists during the press conference. The frankness of the 
answers, including those to so-called "awkward" questions, 
should be emphasized. However, the minister did not duck these 
questions; what is more, he not only gave clear and precise 
answers but also found the opportunity for a broader and franker 
exchange of opinions. 
  In conclusion Army General Pavel Grachev addressed new year 
greetings to all servicemen, members of their families, and 
veterans: "I would sincerely like to express the wish that you 
will feel confidence in the future in the new year. May peace 
and tranquillity come to every home. May all the hopes of 
people in uniform for a better, quieter, worthier, and happier 
life come true."

  [Text] Dozens of generals' posts are to be cut in the 
Russian Ministry of Defense Main Personnel Directorate. 
According to ITAR-TASS, on the eve of the new year, Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev expressed dissatisfaction with the 
directorate's activity at a meeting with journalists. In his 
opinion, under new conditions many personnel officers in 
generals' positions are still doing everything in an 
old-fashioned way, trying to work less with the soldiers and 
looking after higher command personnel better. At the same time 
the head of the military department was not uncomplimentary 
about the lower echelons of the army personnel department, which 
work with sergeants and other ranks. The reform will not affect 
the interests of this category of officer.

duties in the hot spots. 
  May 1994 bring peace, quiet, and confidence in the future 
into each home. May all the bitterness with which the departing

happiness, love of life, and optimism in the New Year.

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First 
Channel Network in Russian at 1800 GMT on 30 December broadcasts 
an item in the "Novosti" newscast in which Aleksandr Ukhov 
reports from Moscow that the Russian Army will be getting a new 
emblem next year. The Moscow Ostankino channel presents what it 
calls "the first pictures" of the new emblem. 
  Ukhov says that the Russian Defense Ministry recently 
organized a competition for a new emblem for the Russian Army. 
Almost 300 proposals were submitted for consideration. The 
results of the competition have recently been announced. The 
new emblem will consist of a crowned double-headed eagle holding 
a laurel wreath and sword. On an inset shield mounted on the 
eagle's chest a horseman can be seen killing a dragon. The 
eagle clutches the Russian national flag and the St. Andrew's 
flag in its claws. 
  A brief interview with V.N.Medvedev, head of the insignia 
department of the Ministry of Defense General Staff 
Headquarters, is then shown. He says: "There are plans for 
placing this unified emblem of the Russian Armed Forces on 
military uniforms, banners of military units, military and navy 
flags, identification marks on military equipment, documents and 
identity cards."

  [Text] In the opinion of Russian Finance Minister Boris 
Fedorov, the government succeeded in pursuing a consistent 
financial policy in 1993. In an interview with the Russian 
media, he announced that over the last year prices had gone up 
nine-fold. Let me remind you, in 1992 they went up by 26 times. 
Moreover, they are quickly approaching world prices at present 
and this means the end of prosperity for low-effective 
enterprises. Boris Fedorov noted as a positive element the fact 
that it proved possible in 1993 to stop a flow of unjustified 
subsidies and credits to CIS countries. At the same time, the 
interest rates were considerably increased and privileges for 
non-effective enterprises reduced. This has led to an improved 
protection of the savings of the population and enterprises 
against inflation.

Article   Type:BFN 

  [Editorial Report] Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian 
at 1330 GMT on 30 December carries an interview with First 
Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar by Arkadiy Bererov. The 
place and date are not given. 
  Gaydar begins by reviewing the performance of the economy 
over the past year, noting that despite the various political 
problems a number of tasks in the first stage of reform were 
solved, albeit slowly, by the end of 1993. The volume of 
subsidies for agricultural production has been sharply reduced 
of late, and a single customs tariff will be enforced from 1 
January. A new system of financing and boosting investments has 
been prepared, which will comprise the gradual redistribution of 
budget allocations to support enterprises and social programs as 
well as family benefits, pension reform, and gradual preparation 
for introducing benefits for the less well-off sections of the 
population. Small business will be encouraged. "In short, we 
are trying to put together a foundation that will ensure stable 
economic growth," Gaydar notes. He goes on to say that there 
should be "a gradual reduction in the rate of inflation in 1994 
to about 5-7 percent by the end of the year." It will be a year 
of "a gradual fading away of the slump in production, which may 
be basically eliminated some time around the end of the fourth 
quarter, and the creation of preconditions for stable growth in 
1995." But, Gaydar says, one must naturally be apprehensive 
after the political damage incurred in trying to solve 
anti-inflation tasks in the recent period, and this must be 
avoided in the coming year. 
  Gaydar goes on to say that unemployment has not risen in the 
Baltic republics either because a similar set of 
employment-protection measures is in effect both there and in 
Russia. "I will, therefore, say that provided there is a 
sensible scenario of monetary policy, I do not envisage a sudden 
incredible rise in unemployment -- not in 1994 at least. It 
will rise gradually." 
  Regarding inflation, Gaydar describes as soft and consistent 
a policy that aims at bringing inflation down from 12 percent 
this December to 5-7 percent in the last quarter of 1994, the 
goal of which is to gradually remove financial disproportions 
and create prerequisites for stopping price rises.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Yegor Gaydar by Tatyana </F>
Chemodanova; place and date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Chemodanova] Yegor Timurovich, what are your views 
on Russia in the new year? 
  [Gaydar] Well, about the Russian economy next year. In 
principle it depends on the economic and political conclusions 
that are drawn from the 1993 events. In our economy 1993 was a 
year of the gradual formation of market relations structures, of 
very slow progress, of vacillations and inconsistency. In spite 
of the mild policy our opponents were not strong enough to 
decisively and consistently switch our economy onto a course, 
lets say, of restoration of traditional mechanisms, or even to 
the Ukrainian course of development. We did not have enough 
power and opportunities to consistently accomplish the policy of 
reforms. 
  At present we are at the crossroads. Naturally, one can get 
scared once more, and, naturally, one can now choose a course of 
fueling inflation, masking it with words about the need to 
support industry structures, [words indistinct] and so on. Then 
in the spring inflation will gradually gain momentum and by 
summer it will once again reach an extremely high level. After 
that it will turn out that it is very hard to live in these 
conditions, that there is nothing nice in it, and there will be 
another budgetary crisis. 
  In short, 1994 will develop approximately along the lines of 
1993. We are at the turning point. Considering the first stage 
as mainly completed, it possible to bring to completion the part 
that remains -- that is the trajectory that we have consistently 
adopted from September when we started bringing down inflation 
from 29 percent to about 12 percent in December, and to continue 
along that line in the first six months, and on that basis 
gradually supplement the economic prerequisites for stable 
market growth. 
  This means a new system of financing and stimulating 
investments, a gradual redistribution of budget allocations from 
the support of enterprises to the support of social programs, a 
gradual widening of the range of programs that can be supported 
up to the already planned reform of family benefits and the 
pension reform that is being prepared, and gradual preparation 
for the introduction of benefits for the poor that will replace 
a large number of badly coordinated benefits. 
  At the same time it is increasing the efficiency of the 
system for encouraging small businesses which there is no sense 
in setting up with a monthly inflation of 25 percent. But when 
we are now already talking about inflation that is predicted to 
become less than 10 percent, those tax privileges that are, 
let's say, stipulated in the latest decree make sense. 
  In short, we must try to develop a basis that will provide 
stable economic growth. Then 1994 will be a year of gradual 
reduction of the rate of inflation, well, at least by five to 
seven percent per month by the end of the year, and a year of 
gradual reduction of the slump in industry which could be 
stopped in the main by around the end of the year, by the fourth 
quarter. It will be a year of developing preconditions for 
stabilizing growth in 1995. It will also be a year for the 
gradual development of a more or less sensible social policy and 
the development of prerequisites for, strictly speaking, growth.

<F P=106> [Igor Petrov report: "The Appeal of a Foreign Label: </F>
Russian Producers Have To Counteract It"] 
  [Excerpts] The dearth of commodities, when all industrial 
goods disappear from the store shelves at whirlwind speed, seem 
to have gone forever. The consumer has been given an 
opportunity not just to take whatever is offered but to 
meticulously choose exactly what he or she needs from the dozens 
of models and companies available. 
  Unfortunately, in the battle to win the customers' hearts 
and 
consequently their cash, our producers, spoiled by the former 
scarcity and unlimited demand, often do not look especially 
attractive. The workers of the "Zarya" industrial commercial 
footwear firm in Moscow have had a good taste of the first 
fruits of competition and the openness of the domestic market. 
Their factory has been visited by First Vice Premier Oleg 
Soskovets who is in charge of light industry. 
  This factory served as the base for an exhibition-fair where 
contracts were signed with industrial enterprises and commercial 
organizations for the production and sale of footwear in 1994. 
And even though the goods on display at the show were the best 
that this country's cobblers have to offer, it was clear that 
they still face major marketing problems. 
  "There must be an on-the-spot investigation to find out just 
why all the stores are crammed with foreign goods at a time when 
we are unable to sell the goods produced by our plants," Oleg 
Soskovets said, explaining the purpose of his visit. [passage 
omitted] 
  After visiting the "Zarya" factory's shops and talking with 
workers and foremen, Oleg Soskovets held a short conference with 
the directors of Moscow textile and footwear enterprises. There 
was just one topic of discussion: What must the government do 
in order to remedy the situation in light industry and prevent a 
further slump in production which has reached almost 60 percent 
in the past three years. 
  The package of measures proposed by the directors were, 
generally speaking, not distinguished by their variety. It was 
the general opinion of enterprise directors that the 
overstocking of the Russian market with cheap but not always 
high-quality imported consumer goods is jeopardizing the very 
existence of the country's light industry. "There must be 
protective customs barriers against the import of finished goods 
into Russia and the export of unprocessed agricultural raw 
materials from the country," the production specialists stated. 
  "We will take care of our enterprises and create normal 
conditions for their work. There is no doubt about that. 
However, government-based protectionism must have reasonable 
limits. Ultimately only the customer with his rubles can 
properly assess the results of production collectives' work. 
Not just to make things but to make things that will sell -- 
that must be the slogan of today," the first vice premier 
believes. 
  The situation in Russia's light industry was the subject of 
the discussion at a session of the Council of Ministers 
Commission on Topical Questions.

<F P=106> [Feature consisting of report by INTERFAX, ITAR-TASS, and </F>
own correspondent Aleksandr Chernykh, and unattributed comment: 
"Draw a Million, Friend"] 
  [Excerpts] INTERFAX: "On 25 December a criminal gang of 
six Chechnya inhabitants was arrested in St. Petersburg. Some 
20,000 counterfeit 50,000 ruble bank notes produced on a xerox 
machine with a total face value of 1 billion rubles were 
confiscated from them." 
  ITAR-TASS: "The year 1993 has been a record one in Perm 
Oblast in terms of the number of counterfeit bank notes which 
are going into circulation. The number of counterfeit notes 
confiscated was almost seven times greater than last year. The 
season was opened by Ashot Oganesyan, who already has two 
previous convictions, from whom 50,000 ruble [R] notes he had 
produced himself were confiscated. The oblast court sentenced 
the counterfeiter to eight years' imprisonment with the 
confiscation of his property. In all 10 people have been 
convicted of counterfeiting money this year." [ITAR-TASS report 
ends] 
  [Chernykh report begins] Tomsk -- There has been a mass 
dumping of counterfeit R50,000 notes in Tomsk. The local law 
enforcement organs had already recorded instances of this kind, 
but not on such a scale. [passage omitted] 
  During the investigation it emerged that the main cache was 
in Novosibirsk. The Tomsk team of investigators traveled there. 
With the aid of their local colleagues they managed to reach 
the underground storehouse. When it was opened the picture was 
very impressive: They discovered 488 counterfeit R50,000 notes, 
counterfeit plates, and blank passports and identity cards. 
[passage omitted] 
  In the opinion of V.O. Grechman, first deputy chief of the 
Tomsk Internal Affairs Administration, the dumping of 
counterfeit money in Russia is a precisely planned operation at 
the state level. On the one hand it is designed to support 
Chechnya's destroyed financial system and on the other directly 
or indirectly to undermine Russia's economy. (Let us recall the 
operations involving fake advice notes which caused us losses of 
many billions -- they came from there, from Chechnya). 
  Good preparation helped the Tomsk law enforcement organs 
halt 
the counterfeit money operations quite swiftly. After the 
"Novosibirsk cache" had been destroyed the dumping of 
counterfeit bank notes ceased. 
  But is that for long? What further inventions will the 
Caucasus bring us in the sphere of economic crime? [Chernykh 
report ends] 
  The number of criminal encroachments connected with the 
production and sale of counterfeit money has increased 350 
percent, a ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA correspondent was told at a 
Russian Internal Affairs Ministry [MVD] news conference. 
Instances of counterfeiting have been discovered in many 
regions of the country. Over the first five months of 1993 
alone counterfeit Russian bank notes with a face value of many 
tens of millions of rubles were removed from circulation. There 
has been a marked enhancement of the counterfeiters' 
organization and professionalism. In a number of cases they 
organize international links and distribute roles and spheres of 
criminal activity. 
  One of the main reasons for the growth of this type of crime 
is the lifting of restrictions on the import of modern copying 
and duplicating equipment from abroad and the repeal of 
previously established rules for its registration by the 
internal affairs organs. This act has not been compensated for 
by other forms of social control. 
  Unfortunately the newspaper editorial office cannot supply 
the reader with the specific results of the internal affairs 
organs' struggle against counterfeiting in 1993. It is not 
known why department chief N.S. Ponomarev refused to talk with a 
correspondent on the telephone. 
  Yevgeniy Tumanov, chief of the Moscow Internal Affairs Main 
Administration department for combating economic crimes, 
believes that almost all counterfeits are distinguished by one 
method of production. It cannot be said that they are all 
produced to a very high standard: Often watermarks are lacking 
and the color of the dye is lighter than on a genuine note but 
naturally you cannot discern these nuances as you go. In 
principle Russian bank notes are quite well protected but after 
all dollars are also forged. And in general we have given our 
proposals on this score to the Main Administration for 
Production of State Bank Notes, Coins, and Medals but for some 
reason they have not been taken seriously. 
  Let us add on our own behalf that recently there has been an 
increase in the number of counterfeit R50,000 notes (the 
counterfeiters do not think small). It is particularly painful 
to lose such a large sum at one go so the MVD and the Central 
Bank urge us to be vigilant. Do not accept R50,000 notes from 
people you do not know. The dye on counterfeit notes is not as 
fast -- rub a folded note to see if it comes off. And to be 
doubly sure wet it with saliva and see if the color runs. 
  Alas, so far that is all the wise fighters to preserve the 
integrity of bank notes can suggest to us. To judge by their 
recommendations all is confusion as regards money right now. It 
is far easier to buy nothing, to sell nothing, and to have no 
money at all.

"1993 Gas Production Down, Gas Exports Up on 1992"] 
  [Text] The downturn in natural gas production that began 
in 1992 continued this year. The general slump in the country's 
industrial production and the impoverishment of enterprises that 
were unable to make prompt payments to gas producers could not 
but affect the gas industry. As of 1 November 1993, consumers 
owed the "Gazprom" Russian joint-stock company 1.5 trillion 
rubles. 
  Aside from that, specialists attribute the decline in gas 
production in 1993 to the depletion of raw material reserves in 
a number of Russia's large fields that have been under 
development for a long time. This is what caused a decline in 
gas production, for example, in the Medvezhye gas field, 
Orenburg oil and gas condensate field, and other traditional 
gas-producing areas at the final stage of development. 
  According to the preliminary data of gas industry 
specialists, Russian gas and oil enterprises produced a total of 
617.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas (22.7 billion cubic 
meters less than in 1992). 
  At the same time, gas enterprises that are part of the 
"Gazprom" Russian joint-stock company -- the largest gas 
producer in Russia -- produced 577.7 billion cubic meters, or 
18.8 billion less than in 1992. 
  Gas production declined in 1993 primarily owing to a slump 
in 
western Siberia, Russia's main gas producing region, where 
"Gazprom" enterprises produced an estimated 535.5 billion cubic 
meters, or 16.3 billion cubic meters less compared with 1992. 
  According to those same sources, Russia increased natural 
gas 
exports to European countries in 1993 by 1.5 billion cubic 
meters and will raise this figure to 100.6 billion cubic meters. 
  According to forecast estimates, gas enterprises will 
produce 
634 billion cubic meters of natural gas in 1994, of which 116 
billion cubic meters will be exported to West European countries.

signature to the Treaty on Collective Security of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). 
  CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korotchenya told INTERFAX 
Shushkevich had done so since, as he said in a note to 
Korotchenya, Belarus's previous form of joining the treaty had 
been given "ambiguous interpretations." 
  Several months ago, Shushkevich sent out letters to the 
Commonwealth heads of state saying that the legislature had 
instructed him to sign the treaty. He told parliament he 
considered the letters to be a formalization of Belarus's 
membership in the CIS collective security system.

  [Text] A BELINFORM correspondent has been told at the 
Defense Ministry press center that the second stage of reform in 
the Belarusian Armed Forces will be carried out in 1994. There 
will be further reductions in the personnel of the former 
Belarusian Military District, which had numbered 250,000 troops 
at the beginning of the reform process. Supporting such a force 
was beyond the capabilities of the Republic's budget. In 
addition, the country's new military doctrine stipulates the 
forming of a nonnuclear force sufficient to protect the national 
sovereignty of Belarus. By the end of 1994, troop strength in 
the Belarusian Army will have fallen to 100,000.

  [Text] The Belarusian Defense Ministry told a BELINFORM 
correspondent that a distinctive feature of the Belarusian Armed 
Forces this year would be completing the second stage of their 
reorganization. The former Belarusian Military District will 
continue to reduce its forces, which until recently numbered 
about 250,000 servicemen, and was an unbearable burden to the 
state budget. In addition, according to the new Belarusian 
military doctrine based on the nonnuclear status, the size of 
the Armed Forces should be reduced to the levels sufficient only 
to defend the country's sovereignty and security. The size of 
the Belarusian Army is expected to shrink to 100,000 servicemen 
within the year.

<F P=106> [Captain First Rank Valeriy Gromak report: "Drowned in a </F>
Sea of Propaganda"] 
  [Text] The Baltic Institute for Strategic and 
International Studies has held a conference in Tallinn on the 
problem of "Baltic Cooperation and Security." Delegates from 16 
countries took part. Seven NATO representatives, headed by 
Brigadier General Tom Lennon, deputy chief of the joint program 
of miltary contacts under the U.S. Armed Forces Headquarters, 
Europe, were at the conference. Also invited were the 
ambassadors to Estonia of the FRG, Finland, and Norway. They 
"forgot" to invite the Russian ambassador. 
  The two days at the conference were spent talking about 
Zhirinovskiy's victory -- this was how one participant, in 
conversation with myself, aptly described what happened in 
Tallinn. The discussion of the problems of cooperation in the 
Baltic region was exploited by the representatives of Estonia, 
Latvia, and Lithuania for one purpose -- to describe the current 
situation in Russia in the gloomiest tones and to try (yet 
again) to get accepted as members of this bloc as quickly as 
possible by putting pressure on representatives of the North 
Atlantic bloc. 
  In my view, a conference on a very important issue was 
transformed through the efforts of its organizers into a purely 
propaganda event, and only the speech of Vice Admiral Viktor 
Kravchenko, first deputy commander of the Baltic Fleet, infused 
a fresh spirit into it, since his speech contained specific 
proposals on the organization of cooperation in the Baltic Sea. 
  Unfortunately, the proposals of the Russian military were 
supported only in the lobbies. From the rostrum Estonian 
Defense Minister Juri Luik expressed support for the creation of 
a unified concept of security of the Baltic countries, at the 
same time suggesting Russia as the adversary. He called for the 
creation of a military-political alliance of the Baltic states 
without Russia's participation, but incorporating Ukraine as 
"the main guarantor of opposition to Moscow's imperial policy." 
  Judging by the speeches of the Estonian defense minster and 
other representatives of the Baltic countries, the leaders of 
these states are trying to create an atmosphere of suspicion and 
distrust around Russia in a cold war spirit.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 03, BNS -- The three Baltic presidents 
-- Lennart Meri of Estonia, Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia and 
Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania -- called on international 
efforts to speed the withdrawal of the Russian troops from 
Estonia and Latvia in their New Year's joint appeal. 
  The full text of the appeal follows: 1993 was a year of 
tremendous progress for all three Baltic countries. The last 
Russian troops were withdrawn from Lithuania and some units were 
removed from Estonia and Latvia as well. All three countries 
made enormous political progress strengthening themselves at 
home through open, fair and free elections at various levels and 
their ties with foreign countries through skillful and active 
diplomacy. And all three countries made important strides in the 
difficult process of economic recovery. 
  But the year ahead promises to be an even more fateful one. 
During 1994 critical decision will be made and important steps 
taken that will determine the future of the entire region. 
Consequently as we look back to what we have achieved in the 
past year with pride, we must nonetheless be fully conscious of 
how much work still lies ahead, specifically: 
  - we call on all on all Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians 
to work together to build on the political and economic 
achievements of the past, 
  - we call on the Baltic peoples to continue their efforts to 
promote peace and stability throughout the region, and 
  - we call on Russian President Boris Yeltsin not to remove 
from his commitment to complete the final withdrawal of Russian 
troops from Estonia and Latvia in 1994, and on the nations of 
the world to continue their efforts to promote this outcome.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 4 TASS -- Today's newspapers focus on 
the results of the past year, prospects for the development of 
the political and economic situation in the Russian Federation 
and the possible distribution of forces and blocs in the new 
Russian parliament. 
  The NESAVISIMAYA GAZETA daily reports about a regular round 
of talks between representatives of major factions in the state 
duma and a candidacy for its chairman. Mikhail Lapshin, leader 
of the Agrarian Party, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that 
if "no consensus is reached on the nomination of a candidate to 
the post of the duma speaker satisfying to all, then deputies' 
votes will have to be counted." The newspaper says that this is 
precisely what leaders of each of the factions will have to do, 
with this procedure expected to be especially painful for the 
"Russia's Choice" bloc since it will obviously lack its own 
votes to overweight the votes of the Agrarian Party, the Russian 
Communist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party. 
  The results of the elections to the new Russian Parliament 
held on December 12 and the victory of the Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky was regarded by 
many people as a threat posed by Russian fascism, says an 
article published by the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. According to the 
newspaper, the "Russia's Choice" bloc, having spent twice as 
much as the Liberal Democratic Party and having bought much more 
air time on television than the Russian Liberal Democratic 
Party, has lost to Zhirinovsky the elections by party blocs and 
managed to level the situation thanks to those constituencies 
which cast ballots for individual candidates rather than for 
party blocs." 
  "All this gives ground to believe that by doing so Russian 
electors, in fact, have denied confidence to Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and the government which after the elections 
becomes the government of the minority," the article says. 
Acording to the article, millions of electors voted not for 
fascism or fascists, but rather for clear-cut politics". 
  Forecasting the development of the situation in the new 
Russian Parliament, the article says that "at present, 
representatives of some parties and blocs renounced cooperation 
with the Liberal Democratic Party which is "fraught with 
distabilisation in parliament and sharp increase of the role and 
powers of the president." 
  As for economic problems, the article says that neither of 
political parties which won seats in parliament has a clear-cut 
and comprehensive economic programme and one can say with 
certainty that neither the state duma, nor the federation 
council will deal with the economics now, leaving it for the 
government to attend to." 
  The RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA daily carries an intreview with 
ex-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. Commenting on the 
development of the economic situation in Russia, Gorbachev said 
that nowadays, Russia needs politics uniting people rather than 
splitting the country. As for the victory won in the elections 
by the Liberal Democratic Party, Gorbachev described its leader, 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, as a splendid actor, adding that " it very 
important to fund out who directs him and who backs him up." 
  "Undoubtedly, his capabilities were appreciated and will be 
made use of in future, but I do not see the need for launching 
an anti- fascist movement in Russia. Are we going to accuse of 
fascism people who voted for Zhirinovsky? By the way, the 
Constitution would not have been approved without these people's 
votes," Gorbachev said. 
  An article published by the SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA today also 
denies that there is a need to create the so-called 
"anti-fascist front". The article says that the idea of creating 
this front is obviously directed against "triumphant elections 
held by the Liberal Democratic Party led by Zhirinovsky, and, 
consequently, against the free will of electors which makes up 
the basis of democracy." 
  The TRUD daily focuses on the results of 1993 discussed from 
different points of view by prominent Russian philosopher 
Alexander Tsipko and an economist and state duma deputy, Vasily 
Selyunin. Tsipko pointed out that in 1993 he was disappointed in 
what was going on in Russia, adding that "neither the truth, no 
democracy and the market itself were any good to a Soviet man." 
  Selyunin expressed a different opinion, pointing out that in 
1993, an end was put to dual power in Russia and the living 
standards began to gradually improve which is seen from the fact 
that the consumption of food has increased approximately by ten 
per cent. "We have saved our economy which many former soviet 
republics failed to do," Selyunin said. 
  The PRAVDA daily writes in its economic forecast for 1994 
that the living standards of the population will further 
decline. "In 1994, approximately 33 per cent of the Russian 
people will have an average income per capita less than the 
minimum subsistence level," the newspaper said. 
  The KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper published the results of a 
sociological poll. The majority of respondents believe that 
life has stabilised and 13 per cent of respondents even said 
that their life improved over the past year.

  [Text] As ITAR-TASS reports, emergency measures have been 
taken in Kazakhstan to lower inflation. Wages and all types of 
bonus payments in the republic are now being strictly linked to 
the amount and quality of labor. By doing this, the leadership 
of Kazakhstan hopes to stop the practice of adjusting money 
payments to cover inflation. The new procedure for payments is 
compulsory for all enterprises. Inspection bodies have been 
given the right to withdraw from consumption funds any unmerited 
sums that have been paid out and to transfer them to local 
budget revenues.

  [Excerpt] The Central Election Commission has issued a 
decree to explain the provisions of the election law in the 
Republic of Kazakhstan; the rights of citizens and public 
movements to campaign in favor of this or that candidate; and 
ensure strict observation of existing regulations on 
pre-election campaigning. 
  Campaigning is not allowed on the day before voting or on 
voting day. It is not permitted to post up election materials 
on the premises of a polling station or of a polling district; 
to circulate anonymous election materials. People working for 
state bodies and the local bodies of self-management are not 
allowed to campaign. 
  Because candidates and their supporters have to make public 
speeches to the electorate and put up election posters in order 
to campaign for the election, district election commissions 
should provide deputies with free halls for election meetings. 
The issue of providing deputies with premises should be 
examined in five days. 
  In agreement with a regional television and radio company, a 
district election commission should ensure that each candidate 
for the Kazakh Supreme Kenges has an opportunity to present his 
platform in Kazakh or Russian and place advertisements, provided 
he pays for this with the money to be allocated by the Central 
Election Commission for his election campaign. Each candidate 
will be allocated 10 minutes on the radio and 10 minutes on 
television, irrespective of where he works. A speech can be 
presented once or repeatedly. 
  The republic's public movements, which have been registered 
by the Law Ministry, are allocated 30 minutes of air time on 
Kazakh radio and television [words indistinct]. Self-nominated 
candidates are allocated an additional five minutes on regional 
and city television or radio. The schedule for allocating 
air-time to deputies will be compiled by the leadership of a 
regional television and radio company and will be approved by a 
district election commission. 
  The editorial staff of newspapers founded by the regional 
administrations and administrations of Almaty and Leninsk, as 
well as of other publications, should promptly publish the 
background of candidates, their platforms, and pictures [passage 
indistinct]. 
  During the election campaign, the mass media should not 
favor 
this or that candidate, election association, or election 
platform. 
  A law-enforcement body and a district election commission 
should call to account those who breach the law on elections by 
circulating pre-election reports which do not correspond to 
reality and discredit the honor or dignity of a deputy and his 
agent. 
  [Words indistinct] to ensure that each candidate to the 
Supreme Kenges enjoys equal conditions in the pre-election 
campaign. [passage omitted]

[Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] has 
banned Toshiba, one of Japan's largest corporations, from 
selling integrated semiconductor circuits to Russia, China, and 
another 25 countries for a month. Toshiba incurred the 
administrative penalty for circumventing the committee and 
secretly selling silicon chips for the production of

-- a considerable size at the time -- were sold to the republic 
between December 1986 and February 1987. 
  Opinion of Yuriy Buykin, representative of the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Relations: 
  "This is a very strange step. There is, after all, already a 
political decision approved by all the committee's member 
countries that it should cease to exist in the second quarter of 
1994. What is more, any ideological backdrop to this step has 
long since subsided. The USSR no longer exists, and a great 
deal has changed in Russia, the other CIS countries, and East 
and Central Europe. Nor does the GDR as such exist. 
  "Incidentally, even in 1986 the ill-starred silicon chips 
were not at all secret. You could buy them anywhere you liked. 
There is no need to remind you that the USSR was at the time 
one of the world leaders in producing this kind of output. And 
in terms of quality this output was by no means inferior to that 
of Japan. But Toshiba's silicon chips were cheaper than ours 
and the Germans preferred them. 
  "COCOM's action is tailoring present-day reality to fit an 
old framework. And will it not make many Japanese firms that 
are willing to trade with Russia ponder: Is the game worth the 
candle?" 
  Opinion of Japanese Embassy representative in Moscow: 
  "At the moment," the editorial office was told, "we have not 
been informed of this decision." 
  Three hours later, following consultations with Tokyo, the 
embassy confirmed: 
  "This decision is in place. No one has revoked the letter of 
the law, but 31 March is still a long way off. Incidentally, 
this ban could be extended to three years, as happened in the 
past, and not just one month...." 
  Editorial Note: The COCOM ban could be seen as a Christmas 
joke were it not for one thing. It turns out that COCOM is 
retaining the restrictions on shipments of around 10 
state-of-the-art technologies and dual-purpose materials to the 
former socialist countries. These include coders, 
heat-resistant and highly durable composite materials, and 
coatings used in the aerospace industry, in particular in 
manufacturing Stealth aircraft, and for Stealth-type radars. 
Admittedly, in this connection it is planned to revise the 
150-item list of output banned for export to countries within 
the former Communist bloc. 
  After 44 years in existence, COCOM is to all appearances 
still following the old tracks through inertia even though the 
whole world has switched to a new course. So, we would like to 
ask its officials whom they want to punish -- the recalcitrant 
firm Toshiba or Russia, say, which has already drawn a bold line 
under its communist past?

  [Text] Beijing, 4 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- Representatives of 
Amur Oblast and the Chinese border town of Heihe have signed an 
agreement on setting up a zone of international trade and 
economic cooperation. 
  The 20 square km zone will be situated on both banks of the 
Amur River. Within the zone it is intended to open up trade and 
banking institutions and industrial enterprises using advanced 
technology and to set up a developed infrastructure. In 
particular, it is planned to build a road bridge. 
  The economic zone will become a base for processing products 
targeted at the markets not only of Russia and China but also of 
other countries. It will have free circulation of goods and 
free currency exchange and it will be managed by a joint 
committee with the participation of representatives of the 
Russian Federation and the PRC.

<F P=106> [New Year's address by Askar Akayev; place and date not </F>
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] The most important and pleasing fact for me in 1993 
was the fact that our Commonwealth, the CIS, turned from an 
amorphous formation into an effectively operating mechanism of 
multilateral economic cooperation, on the one hand, and, on the 
other hand, into a mechanism of maintaining peace and stability 
and preventing conflicts on the whole enormous Eurasian 
continent. 
  Hence, my main wish to all of us is that in 1994 the 
mechanism should begin working in full and we should begin to 
overcome a political, economic, and spiritual crisis that all of 
us are going through. The most important thing -- my sincere 
wish is that finally, there should be a reconciliation at places 
where blood is being shed and civil war is under way. I am 
saying this with pain in my heart. My sincere wish is that 
people should return to a peaceful life. 
  One more thing, I would particularly like to wish to the 
citizens of Russia that 1994 should be a year of peace, 
stability, and progress. 
  It is the destiny of world history that without great Russia 
there can be no harmony, peace, or stability not only on the 
Eurasian continent, but in the whole world. 
  I would like to address all of us, CIS countries citizens, 
as 
my compatriots since we all come from a single Fatherland. 
Compatriots: I would like to wish you peace, well-being, 
solidarity, and fraternity in 1994. Happy New Year!

session. Under examination were two issues: first, the 
fulfillment by the Kyrgyztamakash state concern of the 
government decree on improving the activity of that state 
concern in providing the population of the republic with food; 
and, second, on measures aimed at preserving state property and 
observing tax and customs legislature by the Dzhalabad state 
regional administration. 
  The chairman of the state concern spoke on the first issue. 
He reported on the work of enterprises which are a part of this 
concern. Prime Minister Dzhumagulov noted that it is too 
conservative in its work and demanded that the chairman and 
other senior officials of the concern strengthened the 
leadership of their departments, raise the responsibility for 
the job done on the part of the staff, and exercise control over 
their activities. 
  The session went on to note that Dzhalabad Oblast has 
violated laws which regulate the preservation of state property. 
Regarding the second issue, the prime minister went on note 
that as a result of these violations 427,000 soms worth of 
damage have been inflicted on the state. Only 117,000 somes of 
this sum have been paid back. The head of the government 
demanded they take all the necessary steps to recompensate for 
the damage done to the state.

  [Text] The mass media in Kyrgyzstan have today published an 
open letter from the political council of the republic's Social 
Democratic Party [SDP] to the presidents of Russia and 
Kyrgyzstan. The main reason for this, in the view of the Social 
Democrats, is the considerable deterioration in the people's 
standard of living, the Russian-speaking citizens' increasing 
loss of confidence that they will be given social protection, 
and their worry for their children's future. 
  Given this, the SDP has called upon the presidents of Russia 
and Kyrgyzstan to ensure that industrial enterprises of the two 
countries that have mutual economic ties are granted most 
favored status, in order to avoid bankruptcy and mass unrest 
among the people; to draw up and adopt a law on immigration 
based upon international norms and rights; and to guarantee that 
Russian-speaking citizens in Kyrgyzstan may receive education in 
the Russian language; and finally to conclude an 
inter-governmental agreement on recognizing dual citizenship in 
Russia and Kyrgyzstan.

  [Text] The referendum day scheduled for 30 January by 
President Askar Akayev is approaching. In this connection, our 
correspondent interviewed Turar Koychiyev, president of the 
Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Turar 
Koychiyev, what do you think about President Akayev's decision 
to hold the referendum? 
  [Koychiyev] I think it is a necessary step. We are building 
democracy in our society, and I think that Akayevich is 
absolutely correct because it is a very important political 
question. The president needs to know the public's opinion. 
Our reform process seems to be developing. The path chosen for 
our development is diametrically opposed to what we had before. 
I think we passed one important stage in these three years and 
are finding ourselves at the second stage of our social and 
economic development. Our president is doing his best to 
improve the situation in the country. On 30 January, those who 
want (?equality) and prosperity for Kyrgyzstan should support 
President Akayev's policy. [end recording]

<F P=106> [New Year's message by Imamali Rakhmonov, head of state and </F>
chairman of the Supreme Soviet; read by announcer] 
  [Text] Dear compatriots, it is already the third time we 
are celebrating the New Year under conditions of full 
independence of the republic. The last two years were not 
simple for our people. During this period we have experienced 
such events that will not be forgotten by the people for a long 
time. The past year, despite economic difficulties, has firmly 
established the position of peace in the republic and allowed 
the safeguarding of the integrity of our Motherland and the 
restoral of law and order. 
  Our people began peaceful constructive labor, tackling the 
issues of industrial production. Unfortunately, so far we have 
many difficult problems, similar to those that all of the 
peoples of the former Soviet Union are currently facing. 
  All of us feel for ourselves the consequences of breaking 
the 
economic ties between the states of the former Soviet Union 
republics. Prices of food, consumer goods, and fuel have 
sharply risen. The financial system is in crisis. I have felt 
the pain of the people during numerous meetings with the workers 
of the different branches of the national economy, war and labor 
veterans, and intellectuals. 
  The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and the government of 
the 
republic have been persistently looking for ways to resolve 
these problems in the course of 1993. It was not (?easy) and 
that is for a number of objective reasons. The leadership of 
the republic has inherited a ruined economy after the 16th 
session of the Supreme Soviet. The 18th session of the Supreme 
Soviet, which was convened recently, has adopted a number of 
laws and decisions that are laying a firm foundation in the 
development of our national economy. 
  Next year we intend to change the basic principles of our 
policy. We intend to direct the main force to [word indistinct] 
construction of agriculture and other branches connected with 
the well-being of the people. 
  In the new year we will undertake a number of measures to 
promote the stabilization of the situation in connection with 
ensuring the rights of citizens. We will carry on a ruthless 
struggle against speculators, criminals, and mafia groups. 
  The other problem is the repatriation of refugees. We will 
do everything to bring home those compatriots who had to flee 
the republic. In the course of the visit of Mr. Borhanoddin 
Rabbani, the head of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, to our 
republic, along with the solution of other important problems, 
we have concluded an agreement on refugees together with the 
representatives of the Commissioner of the United Nations. 
  Dear compatriots, my big wish in the new year is that all 
citizens of free Tajikistan will be busy in working hand in hand 
to improve services and utilities in the Motherland and to treat 
each other kindly. The draft of the new constitution of the 
republic will be submitted to the public referendum no later 
than 1994 to provide an opportunity to the people to determine 
the kind of future -- presidential or parliament. The election 
of the new parliament and the head of state will take place in 
autumn. Let the people elect freely the form of the government 
and its head. 
  Dear compatriots, all our achievements and the authority of 
the republic is the result of the friendship and merit of those 
peoples who are living in Tajikistan. During the difficult days 
of the past year, the Russians, Uzbeks, Kyrgyzs, Turkmens, and 
the representatives of other peoples selflessly worked together 
with their Tajik brothers and sisters to restore the economy and 
[word indistinct] of the Motherland. 
  The fraternity and friendship of the peoples of Tajikistan 
is 
the foundation of the young sovereign state of Tajikistan on 
which we will build the future. The international spirit of the 
Tajik people was also displayed in that during the comparatively 
short historical period of time it was recognized [words 
indistinct] countries. On the eve of the new year I would like 
to express sincere gratitude to (?United Nations) organizations 
and heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States for their 
disinterested assistance and support. 
  Sovereign Tajikistan must go through a new stage of 
development in the new year. In connection with this, I 
confidently address the people who have great experience -- war 
and labor veterans, peaceful women, careful mothers, and 
glorious youth -- let us in the new year, shoulder to shoulder, 
by joint efforts take our republic out of the difficult social 
and economic situation. 
  Popular wisdom says that when there is an order and mutual 
respect in the family then one can achieve all kinds of success. 
Let the new year of 1994 be for all of us a year of well-being, 
happiness, peace, and prosperity.

Kabul government and the Islamic National Movement of 
Afghanistan it has been decided that Sher Khan Bandar will be 
transferred to the representatives of Abdol Rashid Dostam. 
  Questions concerning the repatriation of Tajik refugees were 
also discussed. The Afghan representatives said that in 1994 
they will take all the necessary measures to speed up the 
repatriation of refugees and to guarantee their security. In 
addition, a transit camp will soon be opened near the Sher Khan 
Bandar.

  [Text] An international space research center will be 
established in Tajikistan. Our correspondent Raisa Mukhiddinova 
with the details: 
  [Mukhiddinova] The Tajik Government has passed the decision 
to set up an international space research center at the 
Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan. 
Imombabadzhanov [name as heard], candidate of 
physics-mathematical sciences, is appointed to administer it. 
Twenty years ago in the East Pamirs, he set up a small x-ray 
emission station, which in time was turned into one of the 
largest in the world. The scientist said that in the summer of 
1993, the world's scientific public was alarmed with reports 
that the x-ray emission station in the Pamirs was threatened 
with closure. Many famous scientists started writing to the 
government and Academy of Sciences of the republic on the need 
to preserve and restore this installation, so unique in the 
world. 
  To understand their alarm, one must research the history of 
the question a little. Everyone now knows that when studying 
the world of elementary particles, scientists came up against 
many mysterious and complex phenomena, which were impossible to 
reproduce using the most expensive modern accelerators. 
Interest, however, in the interaction of particles accompanied 
by super high energies increased and it was necessary to find 
new possibilities for studying the processes taking place. The 
idea arose of using a natural accelerator, in particular cosmic 
rays or flows of particles with super high energies, which the 
universe continually sends to earth. These particles are caught 
by various pieces of equipment, but the most economical and 
effective method is fixing them onto a film using an x-ray 
emission camera. Such a camera, the biggest in the world, was 
created in the Pamirs.

flour at 1.21 dram, or 250 rubles, per kilo. The rate for 
electricity has been fixed at .20 dram, or 40 rubles per 
kilowatt-hour. Inter-city passenger transportation on buses, 
trolleys, and trams has been fixed at .50 dram, or 100 rubles,

<F P=106> ["Text" of President Geydar Aliyev's New Year's message; </F>
place and date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] Esteemed fellow countrymen, I congratulate you on 
the occasion of the new year, 1994. Today is marked as the day 
of solidarity with Azerbaijani people around the world. On this 
symbolic day, I congratulate all the Azerbaijanis in the world 
and wish stronger solidarity among them in the future. 
  The year 1993 was painful and problematic for Azerbaijan and 
its people. [words indistinct], a part of our republic's 
territory was occupied as a result of Armenia's aggression, and 
our fellow countrymen and kinsmen were forced to leave their 
places of birth and become refugees in 1993. Azerbaijan 
experienced a serious economic and social crisis. Our republic 
has successfully emerged from all those difficulties and 
problems and has confidently entered 1994. 
  The confrontation among individual forces, the harm done to 
Azerbaijan by the separatist forces, and the [word indistinct] 
disrupted social and political stability in our republic and 
brought Azerbaijan to the verge of civil war in mid-1993. The 
threat of civil war has been averted, but bloodshed occurred and 
that state of affairs created a very tense situation in the 
republic. 
  Thanks to our people's awareness, bloodshed was prevented 
[as 
heard], the threat of civil war was averted, the confrontation 
was eliminated, and the separatist forces that tried to fragment 
our republic were rendered ineffective. Consequently, our 
republic has been able to resolve its problems in an atmosphere 
of peace and stability. 
  Azerbaijan tried to obstruct Armenia's aggression and the 
armed attacks by Armenians in 1993. Regrettably, we have 
suffered several defeats and lost part of our territory. Many 
of our citizens were forced to become refugees in their homeland 
as a result of the occupation of our territory by the Armenian 
military forces. More than a million refugees have been 
resettled in the other parts of Azerbaijan. That has had a very 
serious effect on the general situation in the Republic, 
particularly the internal situation. However, it must be noted 
that the situation has changed. 
  Changes have taken place as a result of the establishment 
and 
organization of the Republic's Armed Forces and the work carried 
out to successfully defend Azerbaijan's territory. Our military 
forces and our struggling young men are heroically defending our 
territory and successfully retaliating against the enemy 
attacks. They are dealing blows to the enemy. It can be 
pointed out that all the attacks launched by the Armenian Armed 
Forces over the last few months have been rebuffed. Our 
republic's military forces have defended the positions they 
hold. In fact, they have shown how strong Azerbaijan's defenses 
have become. 
  Bloody fighting is taking place on all battlefronts, and the 
Armenian Armed Forces are to blame for the clashes. 
  We wish to reiterate that Azerbaijan wants a peaceful end to 
the war, which has caused a calamity for our republic. In fact, 
our republic has taken several steps in that direction, and we 
want to reiterate our position at the present time. 
Regrettably, our republic's initiatives have failed to yield a 
result. 
  Nevertheless, Azerbaijan is now able to strengthen its 
military will. I wish to assure our people that our armed 
forces will take the necessary measures to successfully defend 
our republic and retrieve our occupied territory. 
  A war is being fought. Casualties are being inflicted on our 
people. The heroic sons of the Republic's people have been 
martyred in the battlefronts while defending our territory. I 
want to take this opportunity to extend condolences to the 
families and parents of all our martyrs. I bow my head in 
acknowledgment of their heroic effort. God bless the souls of 
the martyrs. May their graves be filled with bliss and may God 
give patience to their families. 
  I am convinced that our people are now able to successfully 
resolve the serious problems that exist now. 
  I want to convey my greetings to our officers and men who 
are 
bravely fighting at the battlefronts and to all our people on 
this festive day. I congratulate them on the occasion of the 
New Year and wish them good health and success in performing 
their sacred duties. 
  The war is continuing. The number of refugees has 
increased as a result of the Armenian military attacks. I 
sincerely congratulate the refugees and all the people on the 
occasion of the New Year. Yes, it is a tradition in our 
republic that our citizens mark the New Year in their homes. 
Regrettably, many of our citizens have lost their homes and 
their parents. They have sought shelter in various places. The 
people and the state respect them, wherever they are. I pray 
that they maintain high spirits and morale. 
  A serious crisis exists in Azerbaijan. The economic and 
social crisis has been caused by nearly six years of fighting 
and certain objective and subjective reasons. This state of 
affairs has reduced the standard of living. Our people are 
living in a difficult situation, but we are aware that our 
people are [word indistinct] and will resolve the existing 
problems. They will leave the painful and problematic year 
behind. Changes will occur in our economy in 1994, and the 
standard of living will improve day by day. 
  Today is the day of solidarity for the Azerbaijanis. I wish 
for strong solidarity to exist among all the Azerbaijanis. 
Solidarity must be established among all the Azerbaijani people 
in the world, particularly those who live in independent 
Azerbaijan. 
  Two years have passed since Azerbaijan declared its 
independence. We are now moving into the third year. We have 
significant tasks to perform. A state of strong solidarity 
among Azerbaijan's people is necessary for the realization of 
these tasks. We can contribute toward solidarity among the 
Azerbaijanis in the world if we establish real solidarity among 
the Azerbaijani people in our republic. In view of that, I urge 
our people to unite and establish solidarity. I also wish to 
assure our people that 1994 will [words indistinct]. 
  I want to reiterate that we are defending our homeland's 
territory. We are working to end the war in Azerbaijan. We are 
working to improve the current situation. We have taken several 
steps in that direction, and we shall continue to do so. On 
behalf of Azerbaijan's people, I signed the Paris Charter in 
France on 20 December. This reaffirmed to the world that 
Azerbaijan is committed to peace, tranquillity, and security. 
However, we shall continue to strengthen our defense forces and 
make an effort to retake our occupied territory. Our people can 
rest assured that all the necessary measures will be taken to 
maintain our republic's territorial integrity and prevent the 
violation of our borders. 
  I want to assure our esteemed countrymen that our territory 
will be liberated, regardless of what may happen in 1994. The 
refugees will return to their homes, and Azerbaijan's 
territorial integrity and state structure will be maintained. 
  I congratulate you again on the occasion of the New Year, 
and 
I wish all the Republic's citizens peace, security, happiness, 
and success. Happy New Year.

  [Text] Baku (January 3) TURAN--On December 31 in his 
televised address to the nation, Azerbaijani President Aliyev 
said that in 1994 all the territories occupied by Armenian Army 
would be liberated. He stressed that this goal should be 
achieved in spite of all losses. 
  The President Aliyev said that there have been positive 
changes in Azeri Army recently. For the last month in the 
course of firings Armenian Army could not break the Azeri 
defense. According to the president, these are the consequences 
of the measures taken by the government in the field of military 
building. 
  Azerbaijan comes out for peaceful means of settlement of the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and it will continue to adhere to 
this policy in the nearest future, the President Aliyev said.

  [Text] Baku, January 30, TURAN--Colonel-General Andrey 
Nikolayev-the commander of the Russian frontier troops is 
visiting Baku. Today at 4 p.m. General Nikolayev was received 
by President Aliyev. As a reliable source at the presidential 
staff told TURAN agency the questions of the further on 
cooperation between Russia and Azerbaijan in the guarding of the 
southern borders of the CIS were discussed at the meeting. 
  Last November Nikolayev told journalists in Moscow that 
Azerbaijan had appealed to Moscow with a proposal of the 
cooperative guarding of the southern borders and this question 
is being working out at present. But the official Baku rejected 
this report then. 
  During the today's meeting Andrey Nikolayev said, that the 
parties intend to discuss the problems of the cooperative 
guarding of the southern borders of the CIS. 
  In his turn, Geydar Aliyev said that Azerbaijan would like 
to 
solve the problems of guarding its borders in complex. For 
Azerbaijan the guarding of the border with Armenian is much more 
important than the guarding of border with the other states, he 
said. In this connection he pointed out, that 170 km of 
Azerbaijani-Iranian border is under the control of the Armenian 
Army. 
  After this the meeting went on behind closed doors.

<F P=106> [Tatyana Shumilina report, followed by PRAVDA commentary, </F>
under the rubric "`Democracy' In Action" and the general heading 
"Entertaining Arithmetic For City Duma"] 
  [Text] How often do we hear it said that we have finally 
been through the most democratic elections in our country's 
history. Is this the case? 
  For instance, in the elections to the Moscow City Duma, 
people were entitled to vote either for one of the candidates or 
against all of them. It turned out that if voters supported one 
candidate, their votes against the other candidates seemingly 
did not exist. And that is not all. 
  Those voters who were opposed to all the candidates were 
deprived of their votes. Their ballot papers were not taken 
into account. Do you not believe me? You want to see it for 
yourself? Be my guest! Let's look at the voting returns: 
  Electoral District No. 1. M.I. Moskvin-Tarkhanov elected. 
He won the votes of 29,180 Muscovites. Votes against all 
candidates -- and, consequently, against him too -- came to 
37,681. 
  Electoral District No. 2. N.M. Moskovchenko elected. 
  "For" -- 18,017. "Against" -- 30,379. 
  Electoral District No. 3. S.A. Goncharov elected. 
  "For" -- 16,881. "Against" -- 19,561. 
  Electoral District No. 4. V.G. Makarov elected. 
  "For" -- 23,440. "Against" -- 26,367. 
  And so on in all the districts bar four. And in nine of the 
35 districts the number of those who voted against all 
candidates was more than 10,000 greater than the number of votes 
gained by the candidate who became deputy. Particularly 
noteworthy was District No. 18. There the elected deputy won 
27,091 votes, but there were 42,153 votes against all candidates 
-- some 15,000 more. 
  In the four districts where the balance was positive, the 
situation was as follows: 
  District No. 4. -- S.Yu. Osadchiy: "for" 24,471, "against 
all" 23,662; 
  District No. 21 -- S.Yu. Zhuravlev: "for" -- 35,393, 
"against" 30,433; 
  District No. 26 -- S.O. Shokhin: "for" 32,531, "against" 
31,427; 
  District No. 28 -- V.K. Plotnikov: "for" 30,540, 
"against" 26,429. 
  I repeat that this was even though voters had the chance to 
vote not against any specific candidate but against the whole 
pack. 
  Why was this possible? The State Duma elections were 
regulated by three legal acts -- the appendix to presidential 
edict No. 1400 of 21 September, presidential edict No. 1557 of 1 
October, and presidential edict No. 1846 of 6 November. Under 
this last edict the "Statute on State Duma Elections" lost the 
requirement that the number of votes cast "for" a candidate 
should be greater than the number of votes cast "against." But 
it said nothing about the city duma. It is not known who 
removed the similar requirement from the Statute on City Duma 
Elections, when it was done, or on what grounds. 
  So it transpires that in Moscow -- a city of many millions 
-- 
only four deputies won a majority. [Shumilina ends] 
<H5>  From the PRAVDA Editorial Office: </H5>
  We do not want to offend anyone or -- God forbid! -- suspect 
anyone of impropriety. 
  But several questions have arisen, and the answers to them 
would allow us and our readers to have no doubts that we have 
moved from the Year of Democracy into the Year of Great 
Democracy. If the answers are forthcoming from the numerous 
delegations of foreign observers, we will be very grateful. 
Thus: 
  1. Is the form of the single-seat ballot paper for 
individual elections of deputies fair and democratic when it is 
proposed that the duly elected person be determined not by 
crossing out the names of the others but merely by placing a 
mark against the name of the favored person? And, if it is 
democratic, then how do those who voted "against everyone" 
differ from those who did not vote? 
  2. Were any foreign observers constantly present at Central 
Electoral Commission information bureaus during the two-week 
computation of the overall election results? And what is the 
explanation for the fact that the information on the voting 
results in the regions on a Russia-wide scale varied so markedly 
during different times -- in the first three days, after a week, 
and finally? 
  3. Do the esteemed foreign observers think it logical that 
Russians should have heard a great deal about their official 
presence in our country, but should never have seen their 
official views of the results? 
  We hope that our Russia-wide issues will not overshadow the 
main city-level question put to the relevant authorities by the 
writer of the above note. In any event, we would like some 
clarification -- were deputies elected to the city duma like 
this or?... 
  Happy New Year, esteemed readers!

<F P=106> [From the "Utro" program presented by Sergey Lomakin] </F>
  [Text] The Public Opinion Fund is continuing to work with 
us and continued its efforts over the New Year period, as 
strange as that may seem. It questioned citizens in the streets 
and at home, and as usual asked them the most extraordinary 
questions. This time the Fund was concerned with the 
Zhirinovskiy phenomenon, as most of us are, too. The following 
question was asked: Which of the following characteristics, 
listed below, would you say most suits Vladimir Zhirinovskiy? 
  Defender of ordinary people--10 percent 
  Supporter of B. Yeltsin--1 percent 
  Cunning and adroit fraud, striving for power by any 
means--28 percent 
  A democrat--2 percent 
  Opponent of B. Yeltsin--9 percent 
  Honest and sincere person, evoking absolute trust--6 
percent 
  A fascist--13 percent 
  Adversary of democracy--4 percent 
  Could not respond--27 percent 
  So, drawing on its conclusions, the Public Opinion Fund is 
convinced that Zhirinovskiy was undoubtedly the man of the month 
this past December, a new type of politician who became familiar 
to Russians directly from the television screen. He beat a path 
into the hearts of voters by sneaking into the intimate circle 
of a family dinner, entering every house directly, and offering 
simple solutions to those who had lost their former bearings in 
life. 
  And so, at least one-sixth of those asked have absolute 
trust 
in Zhirinovskiy and look to him as a defender of the people. 
Only more than 40 percent do not perceive him as an amoral and 
socially dangerous politician. [sentence as heard]. Apparently 
up to one- third of our questionnaire participants have not 
fully taken a stand on the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon. 
  The two-week serving of television-concentrated demagoguery 
was all Zhirinovskiy needed to satisfy more than 10 million 
hopelessly confused and despairing Russians. It is as if the 
naive and trusting Petrukha -- whom you may remember from the 
film "White Sun of the Desert" -- looks up at the figure looming 
over us and says in a questioning and idiotically direct way: 
Vladimir Volfovich, reveal your little face. 
  This was the opinion of the Public Opinion Fund, which, by 
the way, fully respects the choice of the Russian people, as 
does our "Utro" program, who voted for Zhirinovskiy and other 
representatives of electoral blocs. This is something sacred.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan 3 (AFP) -- About 150 Jews gathered to 
pray in the snow Monday outside the remains of an historic 
Moscow synagogue, burnt down last week in what some suspect was 
the latest in a number of anti-semitic attacks. 
  The building, in the Mariina Roshcha district in northern 
Moscow, was badly damaged overnight last Wednesday, in a fire 
which police said was due to an electrical short circuit. 
  Rabbi Berel Lazar is less certain, noting threats made 
against another synagogue recently, and a fire at a Jewish 
community school in Moscow last week. 
  "I hope it is all accidental," said Lazar, sent to Moscow by 
the orthodox Lubavich movement, as he led a service by young and 
old Jews outside the burnt out building Monday. 
  Addressing the two-hour service in the cold, he questioned 
the police's decision not to open an official inquiry into the 
fire. "We have neither the time nor the means to find out who is 
responsible and what happened," he said. 
  Moscow's small number of synagogues have suffered a number 
of 
incidents in recent years, culminating in an arson attack on the 
Hasidic synagogue on Bolshaia Bronnaia street in April 1992. 
  The 1929 Mariina Roshcha synagogue was the only Jewish house 
of worship built after the Bolshevik revolution. 
  Jewish fears have been particularly raised by the electoral 
success of ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. "That is 
just one thing which leads us to say that the events of recent 
days are not simply accidents," said Lazar. 
  In response to a growing threat of anti-semitism, the 
government last October banned a number of organizations and 
publications which were openly anti-Jewish. 
  A Moscow city official, Vladimir Sister, assured Jews Monday 
of the "cooperation, friendship and understanding" of the 
authorities, although he insisted that the fire was caused by a 
short circuit. 
  A collection was organized at Monday's service, as those 
present tried to be positive. "All we can do today is rebuild 
our synagogue," said worshipper Heshiel Fried, his voice 
strained with emotion.

  [Text] THIS PARLIAMENT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO WORK 
WITH, SAYS ANATOLIY SOBCHAK 
  The Mayor of St. Petersburg and a member of Russia's new 
parliament Anatoliy Sobchak is a leading political figure in his 
country. He may be expected to run for President in three years 
from now, at least he has said nothing to rule out the 
possibility. A Petersburg-based reporter for INTERFAX has 
approached Sobchak with a few questions on the outcome of the 
December 12 parliamentary elections. 
  ANATOLIY SOBCHAK: I believe both Russian and European 
political leaders must draw lessons from the results of the 
elections. Nationalism coupled with militarism always equals 
fascism and nationalism rooted in the complicated problems odf 
the Russian armed forces and military-industrial complex, is 
raising head in Russia today. 
  This comes as no surprise now that nationalistic tendencies 
are growing in all the post-Communist countries. The West has 
even supported and hailed the bloom of nationalism in the Baltic 
republics and Ukraine because it produced the breakup of the 
Soviet Union. Now that the Russians have responded with a 
nationalism of their own, many are feeling flabbergasted. I am 
convinced, however, that the democratic forces will meet the 
outcome of the elections with serious political action - that 
all the democratic forces will join hands because, let me make 
it clear once again, Russian nationalism in its present guise 
translates into fascism. 
  IF: Do you feel the results of the parliamentary elections 
will move the Russian government to make serious changes in its 
economic and foreign policies? 
  ANATOLIY SOBCHAK: That was a question you'd better address 
to 
the President and government, although I feel the government 
can't help amending its policies. It must, among other things, 
concentrate on a thought-out foreign strategy which would take 
into consideration the Russian national interests, especially in 
relations with the former Soviet republics. Priorities must be 
changed in domestic policies. A new approach must be taken to 
relations with the constituent parts of the Federation, and more 
attention must be paid to the Russian interests, although not at 
the expense of the rights and interests of other peoples on the 
Federation's territory. 
  IF: Being a lawyer, how do you feel about the possibility of 
opposition to the majority in parliament? 
  ANATOLIY SOBCHAK: The Federal Assembly has neither majority 
nor minority forces, as yet. The parliament is divided more or 
less accurately into the Democrats and those who may eventually 
emerge as the opposition. Those who are customarily described 
as the Independents, make up approximately one third of the 
lawmakers and have yet to define their political views. 
  Besides, all the parties and blocs have yet to mature into 
full-sized political units. Many of them were founded the last 
moment before the elections and who can tell whether part of 
their representatives won't decide to join other parties or 
blocs. Russia's new parliament is so far unpredicatble. It 
would be a mistake to say out of hand that antidemocratic forces 
are commanding a majority in the new legislature. If one made 
that mistake, those who have yet to define their positions, 
would be prompted to join that majority. So I see the need for 
serious and very flexible tactics - real parliamentarism. 
  Transition to normal professional parliamentary work will 
rid 
Russian parliamentarism of the infantile disorders of the 
defunct Supreme Soviet. The transition, however, will take a 
lot of effort because most members of the Federal Assembly have 
no experience of law-making. This will be sure to influence, 
very seriously, the effectiveness of their performance and their 
division into parliamentary factions as well as the formation of 
ad hoc coalitions. In other words, I feel this parliament will 
be very difficult to work with. It may be expected to confront 
both the President and government with many problems, especially 
if neither Boris Yeltsin nor the national Cabinet draw lessons 
from the outcome of the recently held elections. 
  IF: Russia's partners in Europe have voiced serious concern 
about the outcome of the elections... 
  ANATOLIY SOBCHAK: Everyone is concerned about the outcome 
of the Russian elections, Europe even more so that Russia. The 
party wins the elections on party tickets whose leader says he 
is not going to think twice about putting to use a few dozen 
nuclear devices just to make Germany or Ukraine or Kazakhstan 
submit to Russia. (Vladimir Zhirinovskiy of the Liberal 
Democratic Party - IF). 
  The Europeans can't help taking such statements close to 
heart now that they - especially Germany - have already met with 
this kind of leaders. Many remember that no one in Germany gave 
serious thought to Hitler's first calls for expanding eastwards. 
Hitler was made fun of, he was a laughing stock in Germany with 
the result that Europe, and somewhat later the world as a whole 
were plunged into the bloodiest of all wars. So, the western 
concern about what is happening in Russia is understandable. 
  IF: The Commission of Big Europe could, in all likelihood, 
emerge as a mechanism for fighting this threat... 
  ANATOLIY SOBCHAK: There is no doubt of that. As a very 
strong mechanism, I would say. The Commission must play a role 
in the efforts to achieve political unity in Europe and map out 
one blueprint and concerted strategies for foghting nationalism 
and fascism in Russia and other countries of Europe. The 
problem of nationalism is pressing on everyone, including the 
untroubled Belgium, Britain and Spain. It is sitting on 
everyone's agenda. Explosions are heard and other terrorist 
actions are being carried out. 
<H3>  GENERAL BASKAYEV: RUSSIA'S MILITARY DOCTRINE LEAVES MUCH 
ROOM FOR CONTROVERSY </H3>
  Now that the situation in Russia is fairly complicated, the 
internal troops of the country's Ministry of Internal Affairs 
are emerging as a guarantor for domestic stability. The 
commander of the internal troops' Moscow district and the man 
who acted as the military commandant of Russia's White House 
during the October developments in Moscow Major-General Arkadiy 
Baskayev and Viktor Akimov of INTERFAX are focusing on the 
condition and future of those troops. 
  IF: The district under your command is not only central but 
the biggest in Russia? 
  ARKADIY BASKAYEV: The Moscow district of the internal troops 
is one of the biggest among the Federation's nine such 
districts. Its units are deployed in 16 regions of Central 
Russia. But the North Caucasian district is the biggest of all. 
  IF: What characterizes the state off affairs in the units 
under your command? Part of the men are being demobilized and 
new forces are joining the units... 
  ARKADIY BASKAYEV: The situation is complicated. First of all 
there are problems with the draft. Some army commissariats are 
unable to meet the draft quotas. On the whole, men are 
enlisting only thanks to our officers'efforts. Officers meet 
with the mothers of our future troops , brief them on the 
conditions of service and make them feel beeter. As a result, 
there are no AWOL cases. 
  On the other hand, we are receiving weak boys, whose height 
and weight are under the norm. From the very first day we are 
offering them extra rations to be able to work them. 
  Basic training in the internal troops is different from 
basic 
training in other units. Army commissariats are to select boys 
for our operational and motorized units in a bid to insure the 
better physical condition and higher morale of our recruits. 
Our men are committed to action in various parts of this 
country and under especially complicated, if not extreme 
conditions. 
  IF: How do army commissariats select recruits? 
  ARKADIY BASKAYEV: Officers of the internal troops sit on the 
commissariats' panels to find out more about the draftee's 
interests and favorite sports. Men with a criminal record are 
not accepted. 
  IF: What about the draftee's weight and height? 
  ARKADIY BASKAYEV: We used to pay attention to that. Now that 
we are facing problems with drafts, we pay no attnetion to that. 
If we have drafted a sufficient number of men, we ourselves 
take care of that problem. Incidentally, the same army 
commissariats are in charge of drafting men to the internal 
troops and the armed forces under the Defense Ministry. There 
are drafting quotas. 
  IF: How many boys appear unable to meet your requirements 
and 
drop out of your units? 
  ARKADIY BASKAYEV: Practically none these days, which does 
not 
mean everyone copes. Those who fail to cope, are transferred to 
our logistics units. 
  IF: What about the officers, or those who have come to serve 
under a contract? 
  ARKADIY BASKAYEV: Unfortunately, we are facing even more 
problems with the officers than with the men under their 
command. We are losing a growing number of career servicemen 
owing to the shortage of housing facilities and low payments. 
What a commissioned officer earns today - an average of 120,000 
Roubles a month - is no money. Commercial structures lure 
internal troops officers to serve as their security men. A 
deputy company commander is offered 500 000 to 600 000 Roubles a 
month and currency bonuses. So far, our men have, by and large, 
been rejecting such job propositions but are beginning to yield 
to pressure. Under the existing legal regulations I have no 
right to reject a serviceman's request for the severance of his 
contract. As a result, there's a shortage of company and 
platoon commanders in the internal troops. We are seriously 
worried about this. 
  Drafts are a success only in the provinces. Units of the 
internal troops in the provinces are working under regular 
organizational charts. Those who have signed up to serve under 
a contract make up 96 percent of our regiment in the city of 
Briansk. In Moscow,however, and other cities, very few men are 
signing up to serve under a contract. Housing presents a very 
difficult problem. 
  IF: A short while ago the media accused you of resorting to 
force in the attempts to resolve this problem. A residential 
project was seized... 
  ARKADIY BASKAYEV: The housing problem is one of the most 
pressing. Only in Moscow more than 500 commissioned and non- 
commissioned officers have nowhere to live. My deputies in the 
rank of General down to commissioned and non-commissioned 
officers with a seven-to-eight-year length of service are living 
in dormitories. Only men who have served at least five years 
with the internal troops are regarded as those without housing 
facilities and are placed on a housing list. 
  Not so long ago the district bought 14 apartments in a 
residential project built by veterans of the war in Afghanistan. 
The families of officers who moved into those flats used to live 
in emergency conditions, without heating and gas. We had to 
position our men around the house because people who described 
themselves as refugees started moving in without any legal 
reason for it. We were allowing in only those who could prove 
their right to live in that house. 
  I was surprised and very angry when several mediaa editions 
started twisting facts to accuse the internal troops of the 
arbitrary armed seizure of housing facilities. Repeat: In full 
keeping with law and in line with an appropriate formal 
agreement, we bought and are protecting housing facilities for 
our homeless officers. 
  IF: You are a career officer with a lengthy service record. 
Even though the internal troops will not be acting directly 
under the recently adopted military doctrine, what is your view 
of the doctrine? 
  ARKADIY BASKAYEV: In my view, it leaves much room for 
controversy. On the one hand, the Russian armed forces are 
adopting a totally new strategy, and on the other the troops are 
unable to meet their new objectives. I think, thought must be 
given to this. 
  Incidentally, there is a clear-cut strategy for the internal 
troops and prospects are clear for their advance. Instead of 
guarding penitentiaries, the internal troops will be enegaged 
primarily in operational assignments. Only police forces will 
from now on be used as prison guards. There will be no more 
soldiers atop the penitentiaries' observation towers. 
  The internal troops are to help the police to enforce law 
and 
order, especially in the areas under a state of emergency, say 
Ossetia and Ingushetia (Russian republics where inter-ethnic 
tension is running extremely high, in the northern Caucasus - 
IF), and to act hand in hand with the police to fight crime. 
The elite brigade quartered in Sofrino near Moscow has already 
been committed to action in this kind of operations in Moscow. 
I see the results as good. 
  IF: What exactly is the Sofrino Brigade? 
  ARKADIY BASKAYEV: It was formed in October or November of 
1988. It took part in the enforcement of law and order in 
Tbilisi and Baku in 1989. By 1991, it had been engaged in the 
efforts to disengage the conflicting parties in Nagorni Karabakh 
and in 1992-1993 it was used to insure security in the areas of 
interethnic conflicts in the Northern Caucasus. More than 200 
of its commissioned and non- commissioned officers have received 
government awards for the role they played in the October 
developments in Moscow. 
  As of date, all its men are staying in Sofrino. They are 
undergoing combat and special training. As well as men of any 
other unit, they are expected to know how to use different kinds 
of arms. And, they may be engaged in street fighting and will be 
expected to know how to use plastic shields and police 
truncheons, and they may be committed to action under emergency 
conditions. 
  IF: Back to the October developments in Moscow. What lessons 
did you, a commander with a combat record, draw from them? 
  ARKADIY BASKAYEV: The main lesson I am drawing from them, is 
this: All political problems must be resolved by political 
means- by way of negotiation - without dragging the 
military,including the internal troops, into attempts to settle 
differences. As soon as the military come to play a role, blood 
is shed. 
  On the other hand, I am sure a civil war was averted in 
October. If the confrontation had continued, the country woul've 
split into two camps. Thank God, that was averted. 
  IF: Was there an alternative to the military action? 
  ARKADIY BASKAYEV: I don't think there was. Procrastination 
would've led to a civil war. Law and order forces were acting 
without hesitation, as well as the internal troops. They abided 
by the law and in full recognition of reality. There was no 
alternative to what they did on October 3 and 4. 
  IF: Was the use of tanks fully justified? 
  ARKADIY BASKAYEV: In my view, their experience and technical 
means at their disposal enable the internal troops to seize 
control of buildings without the use of tanks. 
<H5>  ALEKSANDR RUTSKOY DID NOT VOTE </H5>
  Yuriy Ivanov, the legal counsel of former Russian Vice 
President Aleksandr Rutskoy, related to INTERFAX Exclusive what 
his client had to say about the results of recent elections. 
  Above all, Rutskoy did not vote because he believes that a 
coup was staged in the country and "the legal basis" decreed by 
Yeltsin for the constitutional reform was a sham. The reports 
of his voting were untrue. 
  He also understands that the disbandment and shelling of the 
country's top legislature and its defenders "brought about a 
hopeless situation which could only be aggravated if there was 
no parliament at all." 
  In Rutskoy's view, the election results are significant and 
instructive. In his view, constructive patriotic forces must 
make certain conclusions because the nearly 50 percent of the 
eligible voters who did not go to the polling stations "lost 
faith in the ability of the present leaders to change the 
situation in the country for the better. Serious work is needed 
with these Russians and those who are still naively optimistic 
about pseudo-democrats and 'radical reformers'." 
  Rutskoy appreciates the position of the voters who rejected 
the "bankrupt presidential policy and those who grabbed power 
for the sole purpose of dismantling the country and plunging the 
Russian people into mud." The people saw through "defenders of 
the people" such as Russia's Choice, PRES and the Democratic 
Russia Movement and deprived them from "a clear victory" so much 
awaited by Yeltsin. 
  Rutskoy attributed the success of the LDPR and its leader 
Zhirinovskiy to the well-planned electoral campaign and clear 
presentation of their political platform. They succeeded in 
persuading the Russians that the party did not want their votes 
for selfish purposes but sincerely wanted to do something for 
the sake of the Russian state and "the impoverished and hunted 
down Russian people." In the LDPR platform "the Russian idea" 
sounds convincing against the background of lies, perpetuated by 
"democrats," about anti-crisis policies and successes in 
countering inflation. "It is a pity that the people did not 
fully understand who drove the country into this crisis." 
  The former vice president noted that "all post-electoral 
groans about Zhirinovskiy's domination of the TV and radio time 
are ridiculous." He could hear one of Moscow radio programs in 
his prison cell and he found that most of the radio time was 
taken up by interviews and programs with "government and other 
pseudo-democrats who were brainwashing the population." 
  Rutskoy thinks that Zhirinovskiy must be thankful to 
"gentlemen democrats" for the shelling of the parliament 
building and barring the National Salvation Front, the Russian 
All-Popular Union, the Russian Christian Democratic Movement and 
other patriotic movements from the elections. 
  The good showing of the Russian Communist Party "which has 
gotten rid of various opportunists especially significant in the 
light of what the communist movement has been through over the 
last two years," Rutskoy thinks. He believes that the party 
will increase its popularity if it pursues an intelligent policy 
of defending the national interests for the sake of the state 
and the people. 
  In Rutskoy's view, the Agrarian Party could do even better. 
He "wished that party well and is sincerely glad that it will 
have a large parliamentary representation and this will help the 
party to gain even larger support." Rutskoy wanted to 
congratulate the party and its leader Lapshin on their victory. 
(By the latest reports, the party won 4,261,398 votes, or 7.90 
percent - IF). 
  Rutskoy also congratulated the Russia's Women bloc which, he 
is confident, will vigorously protect the rights of the better 
half of the Russian population and the interest of the family 
and child. 
  Rutskoy denounced the "flagrant duplicity" of democrats, "in 
particular the Kozyrevs, Poltoranins, Shumeykos and others who 
are now publicly wooing those whom they called fascists and 
reds-and- browns as recently as a month ago." 
  Two weeks ago, Rutskoy says, Kozyrev demanded banning the 
Communist Party but now he is prepared to ally with it. This, 
the former vice president thinks, "is a classical case of the 
ease with which such politicos are sold and bought. Should we 
not expect statements about the importance of joint actions with 
communists from people such as Novodvorskaya, Bonner, Popov, 
Yakunin and Sobchak? Communists, he thinks, must be especially 
cautious in dealing with such new "friends" and remember that 
people of this kind are the worst anti-communists. 
  Rutskoy was glad that Lipitskiy and other Civic Union 
figures 
had a measure of support, even though the results fell short of 
the expectations. 
  He objected to using the term fascism in describing 
Zhirinovskiy and the millions of Russians who voted for the LDPR 
because that would offend a major part of the electorate. 
Rutskoy emphasized that "fascism and fascists are those who 
ordered building a barbed wire fence around the House of Soviets 
and shelling parliament for the whole world to see." He 
recalled that one salient feature of fascism was legalized 
authoritarian rule and running the country by decree rather than 
by decisions made by democratically elected bodies.

<F P=106> [Leonid Okhotin article: "Antiliberal Front: Designers of </F>
New Split"] 
  [Text] The defeated liberals' attempts to create an 
"antifascist front" mark the political death throes of a ruling 
regime that proved incapable of even creating the illusion of 
popularity with elections that bore little relation to 
democratic norms. The aggressive logic adopted by the 
authorities as they consistently antagonize, humiliate, and 
snipe at their political adversaries old and new has made the 
political elite totally isolated. Under the spell of their own 
omnipotence and thrilled by the passivity of the people and the 
demoralization of power structures, the liberals easily 
alienated both democrats, patriots, and communists. And now, 
faced with the whole spectrum of hostile "Red," "Brown," 
"Red-Brown," "Black," "White," "international," "nationalist," 
people's," elitist," "youth," and "nonyouth" forces, they have 
finally become aware of the seriousness of the situation. But, 
instead of reconsidering their course, we are once again seeing 
the liberals' typical, extremist move: If everyone is against 
us, it is necessary to split the opposition and generate a new 
civil conflict, and that is also the purpose of proclaiming an 
"antifascist" front. 
  Incidentally, we would point out that the actual creation of 
this front is in direct contravention of the law -- even the 
Constitution that has just been adopted. The creation of 
"antifascist front" branches in the prefectures (that is, 
attached to organs of executive power) contravenes the 
fundamental provision of the new Constitution regarding the 
absence of any ruling ideology in the state (which means the 
absence, among other things, of antifascist ideology, which can 
only exist as a sociopolitical, but not a state phenomenon on 
any account). But the fact that the Constitution was violated 
as soon as it was adopted should not surprise those long 
accustomed to the dictatorial methods used by the authorities. 
  On the other hand the idea of an "antifascist front" is 
clearly aimed against the election triumph won by Zhirinovskiy's 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and thus against the voters' 
free will, which is the basis of democracy. In other words, in 
the wake of the "highly democratic elections" their defeated 
organizers are cynically flouting their own constitution and 
their own "democracy." 
  The total absurdity of this postelection behavior by the 
liberals is obvious not only to Russians, but also to foreign 
political observers. Thus, France's LE MONDE wrote in an 
article 21 December 1993 with the following highly significant 
question as its headline "Is Western Support for Yeltsin 
Justified?": "The main danger to Russia today is not fascism 
but the policy pursued by the incumbent authorities." In a 
situation where the "overwhelming majority of voters 
unequivocally stated that they either do not support Yeltsin's 
course or categorically reject it" it is quite unjust to say 
that Yeltsin has supposedly won a "third vote of confidence." 
Nor did the latest piece of deception as regards early 
presidential elections increase the president's influence or 
popularity, LE MONDE wrote. 
  Bearing in mind that France, the democratic LE MONDE in 
particular, is an outpost of antifascism and democracy in Europe 
it is quite obvious how other, less antifascist countries should 
regard the defeated liberals' clownish idea of "antifascism." 
Confidence in the current authorities in Russia is on the wane 
even among their foreign supporters. Each new step taken to 
escalate the political situation meets with increasingly obvious 
antipathy. 
  So it is obvious that provocation is behind the 
"antifascist front," but what is its ideological thrust? 
  One Radio Liberty commentator commenting on the postelection 
situation recently made the following unequivocal statement: 
"The nationalists' victory jeopardizes reforms in Russia." Let 
us ponder this statement, which in effect explains a great deal 
about the reforms. If a socialist or communist victory, for 
instance, could indeed be logically interpreted as a threat to 
liberal (that is, radical capitalist) reforms, on what grounds 
are the "interests of reformers" being compared to "national 
interests"? Thus, the purpose of the reforms being implemented 
by the current authorities, as they themselves see it, is 
identified with antinational activity. Otherwise there would 
simply have been no panic over Zhirinovskiy's victory, since on 
an economic level he supports liberal capitalist 
transformations, which should, in his view, however consider 
national interests. 
  Thus, the liberals' undisguised fury toward Zhirinovskiy 
represents an expressive feature of the ideological portrait of 
the incumbent authorities, revealing that reforms are aimed not 
only against a socially oriented economy (socialism), but also 
against nationally oriented capitalism. 
  On a social level the liberals support radical capitalism, 
the concepts of Hayek, Friedman, etc., and from the outset this 
made them enemies of the Communists. In the sphere of the 
economy and the state the Communists were and still are the 
radical antipodes of the ruling liberals. This was manifested 
particularly clearly at the time of the August putsch and the 
subsequent banning of the Communist Party, but at that time 
other forces joined the liberals in opposing the Communists -- 
the social democrats, the democrats, and certain national 
anticommunist movements. 
  The liberal elite began to be "cleansed" of "fellow 
travelers" at the next stage. The main target being the 
soviets, the social democrats, and other democratic or socially 
oriented institutions and political forces. The bombardment of 
the parliament put an end to the alliance between the democrats 
and the liberals. Even those democrats who did not join the 
social democrats, the christian democrats, and the 
constitutional democrats in directly defending the White House 
were nonetheless in various forms opposed to terror and 
dictatorship, opposed to tyranny and authoritarianism. It was 
from this moment that a progressive split in public opinion 
began, a split reflected in the democratic choice made by such 
newspapers as NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA, 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA in part, and MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI (we would 
remind you of the very honest reporting of the events of 
October) and the opposite liberal choice made by MOSKOVSKIY 
KOMSOMOLETS, IZVESTIYA, etc. In principle the division of 
Yeltsin's former confederates and supporters into several blocs 
during the election campaign also reflected the objective 
ideological dissociation between the liberals and democrats in 
the ruling strata itself. Travkin represented the most radical 
democratic and antiliberal flank, Yavlinskiy was somewhat closer 
to the liberals, and Shakhray and the Movement for Democratic 
Reforms went further. It was only "Russia's Choice" that acted 
as a purely liberal ideological bloc. Thus, the division of the 
liberals and democrats lent an ideological tinge to the entire 
election campaign. 
  Zhirinovskiy's victory presented the liberals with a 
dilemma: 
Either to enter into an alliance with him on the grounds of 
their single liberal orientation or to remain true to their 
textbooks and spurn national interests as somehow impeding a 
"free market." The liberals' total lack of political 
flexibility also took its toll this time. Instead of seeking 
out allies they set about making themselves new enemies with 
threats of executions, guns, and "antifascist committees." 
"Fascists" now undoubtedly include not only all "Red-Browns" 
but also all democrats, who have been rudely repudiated by the 
extremist liberals. 
  The ideology which, contrary to the statement of the 
Constitution, has become the prevailing, dominant one in our 
society is the classic Anglo-Saxon liberal ideology, which 
denies in a totalitarian manner all other political concepts' 
right to exist. This ideology is antisocial and antinational. 
  We have gotten a one-party state, which is now actively 
setting up punitive institutions to preserve the power of the 
ruling elite. The European newspapers joked that "the Russians 
will now take Lenin out of the Mausoleum and put an embalmed 
statue of Adam Smith in his place." 
  The provocative call for the creation of an "antifascist 
front" is politically important for the liberals. The cynicism 
and brutality of the "reformists'" liberal measures have 
alienated all other political forces that are in any way 
different from liberal orthodoxy. An antiliberal alliance of 
Communists, nationalists, and democrats is clearly brewing in 
the new Duma. Under these conditions, sensing danger, the 
liberals decided to urgently provoked a conflict between their 
adversaries. If indeed the "antifascist front" even becomes a 
temporary, transitory reality the antiliberal opposition's 
strategic game will be totally ruined. 
  Instead of uniting all forces whose ideology focuses on 
collective interests (be it the socialists' "socium," the 
nationalists' "nation," the democrats' "demos") against the 
liberals, who, in accordance with their classic position, insist 
on the supremacy of the individual, the "antifascist front" 
would like to set the Communists and the democrats against the 
nationalists or at least split all opposition movements and 
parties, particularly those represented in the Duma, into 
supporters and opponents of "fascism." Naturally by "fascism" 
the liberals mean any nonliberal ideology, any ideology that 
differs from theirs, so the time is nigh when they will use the 
term "democratic fascism," devised by extreme Communists, to 
abuse their democratic opponents. Similar charges have already 
been heard from liberals regarding those who disagree with the 
line pursued by "Russia's Choice." 
  The defeated liberals' "antifascist" adventure would be 
ridiculous where it not for the political naivete of our people, 
who have difficulty in distinguishing between a vile, 
meaningless slogan and a genuine program. Representatives of 
the older generation of Communists, certain provincial 
democrats, and even some archaic patriots and conservatives may 
regrettably succumb to "antifascist" rhetoric. 
  Having become aware of the perfidious scheme being hatched 
by 
the liberal "executioners of Russia," all political antiliberal 
forces have to find a common platform. The creation of an 
"antiliberal front" is on the agenda -- a front which could 
include "Reds," "Whites," and "democrats." The existence of 
such an "antiliberal front" in the Duma could be the last 
opportunity to peacefully remove the uncontrolled "reformers" 
from power.

  [Text] Moscow January 3 TASS -- Well-known Russian 
economist Grigory Yavlinskiy, one of the leaders of a democratic 
electoral coalition, told ITAR-TASS on Monday that rumors 
circulating in the mass media that he was offered a job as 
chairman of the Anti-Monopoly Committee were completely false. 
  Such rumors apparently arose from the fact that Yavlinskiy 
was asked to propose an appropriate candidate for that post. "We 
were talking about strengthening the Anti-Monopoly Committee, 
but there was no question of my appointment," he asserted.

  [Text] Moscow January 4 TASS -- President Boris Yeltsin 
enjoyed 12 per cent popularity and was the first in the "man of 
1993" opinion poll conducted before new year by the Institute of 
Parliamentary Sociology among 1,000 Muscovites. 
  Yegor Gaydar, the architect of Russian reform, received only 
four per cent, while nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
came third with three per cent popularity, according to the poll 
published by the "MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS" daily on Tuesday. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton and noted Russian economist 
Grigory Yavlinskiy enjoyed two per cent of popularity. 
  Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, famous 
cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, Deputy Prime Minister Sergey 
Shakhray and former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy received 
close to one per cent. 
  Two women listed their husbands as the man of the year. 
  The poll showed there are fewer people dissatisfied with 
their life in Moscow than across Russia. In the Russian capital 
the figure was 59 per cent, while in the whole of Russia it is 
75 per cent. 
  55 per cent of Muscovites said 1993 was unsuccessful for 
them, while 42 said it was successful.

"Barkashov Arrested in Hospital"] 
  [Text] Yesterday officers of the Russian Federation MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] confirmed in conversation with 
PRAVDA's correspondent that the press report of the arrest of A. 
Barkashov, leader of Russian National Unity, who is under 
investigation following the well-known events of October, 
corresponds to the truth. However, they refused to comment on 
this event, citing the fact that an official ministry report is 
being prepared. 
  Barkashov was identified in hospital, where he underwent two 
operations after receiving gunshot wounds. In his words, he was 
shot at from a passing car at 0300 hours not far from the 
"Oktyabrskoye Pole" subway station. Someone brought him to 
hospital, bleeding profusely. There Barkashov spent a week 
before being identified. 
  The arrested man was transferred to another hospital, under 
heavy guard. His condition is serious. But journalists 
visiting his wife have reported that he is still conscious. 
  Stop Press: The Russian MVD Public Relations Center has 
announced that, as a result of current investigative measures by 
the internal affairs organs on 30 December 1993, Aleksandr 
Barkashov, leader of the so-called "Russian National Unity" 
movement, was discovered in a Moscow Oblast medical 
establishment. He was brought to the Russian MVD hospital, where 
he was given medical aid. 
  The same source said that Barkashov was in hospital in 
connection with gunshot wounds received in a certain population 
center in Moscow Oblast -- not in the capital, as reported 
earlier. Criminal proceedings have been instituted in 
connection with the attack on Barkashov.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "To ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Readers"] </F>
  [Text] The appearance of the first issue of the new year 
is always an occasion for celebration for journalists. Today 
for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, this celebration is threefold. 
  First, the number of subscribers to our newspaper has 
increased by a factor of 12 and its print run has hit 600,000. 
This makes ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI one of the country's most popular 
publications, and puts it among the top five Russian newspapers. 
  Second, you see before you the first 16-page issue -- the 
next stage in the development of our newspaper, which is 
constantly expanding its topics and volume. 
  Third, this is one of the first issues of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 
in its capacity as a publication independent of the organs of 
power. We needed three years to acquire freedom. We 
consistently upheld the idea that the press in a democratic 
state cannot be a "tool" of government, but that it must be an 
instrument of society's monitoring of all branches of power. 
Our move is not a strategic maneuver, nor is it an attempt to 
stand in opposition to the government, which has enough 
opponents today without that. On the contrary, we will fairly 
and thoroughly report the government's efforts to reform the 
national economy, promptly inform readers of the essence of the 
decisions being adopted by it, and publish the most important 
decrees and commentaries on them. We want to help our readers 
to evaluate government actions correctly. 
  Once again we stress: The topic of power, the topic of the 
formation of the Russian state will remain paramount in our 
newspaper. We deem our most important task to be to provide 
information about the processes under way in society, and to 
expose political "machinations," and the mechanism for adopting 
decisions. 
  Other of our readers' diverse interests will be satisfied by 
the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI sections which are offered in this issue. 
  DELO and DENGI are addressed to entrepreneurs. 
  PROMYSHLENNAYA GAZETA is aimed at producers. 
  VEKHI is a newspaper for the independent intelligentsia. 
  RETSEPT is a supplement for those interested in health. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI is an important source of information for 
workers in the system of executive power, jurists, and 
economists. Our KURYER and DOKUMENTY sections are aimed at this 
group of readers, promptly publishing edicts and directives from 
the president, government decrees, and normative acts by 
ministries and departments, which come into force only after 
publication in our newspaper. 
  The new year poses a difficult task for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI -- 
to live up to its name, to become a newspaper reporting 
extensively on the life of the regions, the Russian heartland. 
To this end, our correspondent network in the localities is 
constantly growing. 
  As of now ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI already has 18 own 
correspondents 
within the country, and one abroad. The number of correspondent 
offices is set to increase further. 
  We will strive to ensure that ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reaches 
readers in good time, and without delays. To this end, we are 
printing it not only in Moscow, but also in 16 other cities 
around the country. 
  We will try to maintain a reasonable price for our 
newspaper. 
To this end, the editorial office is expanding its commercial 
activity, increasing the volume of advertisements published. 
  The reader's opinion is pivotal in the newspaper. We are 
therefore publishing a page of readers' leaders in this issue: 
lively, "undiluted" letters. Permanent dialogue with readers is 
one of our immutable creative principles. 
  Analytical centers, in which the country's leading 
scientists 
are working, are being set up under the editorial office and a 
powerful information service is being formed. We have already 
concluded a contract with REUTER, the world's leading news 
agency, from which we will obtain news and photographs. It is 
planned to set up a fitness center under the editorial office, 
where leading Russian doctors, the authors of our RETSEPT 
section, will be able to give you a consultation. 
  We will only be able to implement all these plans with your 
support, dear readers. It is with a hope for this support and 
mutual understanding that we are beginning our dialogue in the 
new year.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 4 Jan--Journalists of major newspapers are 
prepared to suspend their publications beginning 11 January. 
This protest action against the government's decision to 
reevaluate the assets of national economic enterprises was 
announced at a news conference today. 
  Editors in chief of KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, MOSKOVSKAYA 
PRAVDA, 
VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA, MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 
and many other publications said that Resolution No. 1233 of 25 
December would result in a 600 percent increase in printing 
costs and would, in fact, be tantamount to stifling the press. 
  Journalists' unions of Russia and Moscow, the Association of 
Publishers and Editors in Chief, and the Fund for the Defense of 
Glasnost have demanded the following: that purpose-built 
allowances to publications be earmarked in order to continue 
issuing the numbers of copies prepaid by subscribers; that a 
special procedure for the implementation of the resolution in 
printing and communications industries be introduced; and that 
editorial collectives be offered real possibilities for 
privatizing printing works and related facilities. 
  Stressing that the planned action was a forced measure, 
Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Union of Journalists of 
Russia, voiced the hope that the government would go halfway 
toward meeting the journalists' demands in the very near future. 
He said that a final decision on carrying out the action will 
be made tomorrow. Furthermore, the majority of regional 
publications in Russia are ready to participate. Radio and 
television journalists will back their colleagues.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Vasiliy Grigoriyevich Samokhvalov, </F>
prominent lawyer and one of the authors of the Law on Television 
and Radio Broadcasting, by Sergey Lomakin; from the "Utro" 
program -- live] 
  [Text] [Lomakin] I now propose that television viewers join 
our discussion in which we will talk about something that is 
probably of great interest and that will be very important next 
year, something that concerns everyone -- about television and 
radio broadcasting. My guest is Vasiliy Grigoriyevich 
Samokhvalov, a prominent lawyer and one of the authors of the 
Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting, which has not yet been 
adopted.... 
  [Samokhvalov, interrupting] Unfortunately. 
  [Lomakin] Yes, it is only on paper so far. We will talk 
about some of the president's latest edicts concerning 
television and radio broadcasting. So, a Russian Federal 
Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting has been 
established. Has a Gosteleradio [State Committee for Television 
and Radio Broadcasting] been revived? 
  [Samokhvalov] I would not say so. After all, the Ministry of 
Information and the Press has been reorganized. Two services 
have been established on its base which, depending on how they 
organize their work, will either justify their existence or be 
reorganized once again. But according to the plan and the text 
of these edicts, very important functions have been vested in 
these services. This includes support for state and nonstate 
television, registration of television companies and mass media, 
and so forth. 
  [Lomakin] You know, Vasiliy Grigoriyevich, I think that the 
viewers are absolutely uninterested in all these 
behind-the-scenes affairs of ours, even in our journalistic and 
editorial affairs. I mean, such things as the furniture we use 
and the equipment we work with. Only one thing about this edict 
concerns them: Will television be better? Will their favorite 
programs disappear or remain? Will they move to other channels 
or broadcast times, and so forth? 
  [Samokhvalov] We must understand one thing, that a great 
deal 
depends on the normative or legislative basis of television. It 
is much the same with health laws, for instance. Sooner or 
later they will have an influence on our health. Will we get 
free medical treatment or we will get good or bad medical 
treatment? This also goes for television. These edicts create 
a certain legal space which gives domestic television an 
opportunity to work better. I think that if the new Federal 
Assembly adopts the Law on Television and Radio Broadcasting 
which reflects the necessary articles, then television will be 
able to work better, and consequently this will be borne out in 
its programs and television will be directed more toward the 
interests of our esteemed television viewers. 
  [Lomakin] Now take a look, Vasiliy Grigoriyevich, at what an 
interesting thing we get -- a certain idea lies behind the 
framework of the edict that one television channel will remain a 
state channel, and the second channel will be privatized, 
auctioned off, and will carry independent television company 
programming. Yet we are already running into contradictions 
with our television viewers. We are trying to put a lot of 
advertising into our programming, and this irritates the 
television viewers. They do not like this, yet we survive from 
advertising. How will the state channel differ from the 
nonstate channel? 
  [Samokhvalov] There are some existing norms. For instance, 
the Law on Mass Media determines that advertising must not total 
more than 25 percent of the broadcast time of television 
programming. A separate draft law is being prepared on 
advertisements in the mass media. I think that this is 
precisely where problems of placing advertisements in feature 
films and other television programs will be dealt with in 
greater detail. In other words, this requires normative and 
legislative regulation. 
  [Lomakin] Vasiliy Grigoriyevich, let us switch from 
television to the very, very latest problems. The fact of the 
matter is that as far as we know, the Russian Press House is 
supposedly being transferred for use by the Federal Assembly. 
In other words, the journalists will be kicked out of it and 
the newspapers will be kicked out. So, do journalists have any 
rights, in general, or not? I am curious. 
  [Samokhvalov] Journalists? I feel very sorry for you because 
you are the anchorman of one of the more interesting programs 
and you should know your rights. Of course, you also have 
responsibilities, according to Article 47, to find and request 
information, visit various organizations, take notes, and so 
forth. All of these rights exist, and they are in effect. There 
are journalists' responsibilities, and I think that the Law on 
Television will permit a more specific determination of the 
rights of television journalists, for instance, or radio 
journalists. 
  [Lomakin] What about the Russian Press House? That is the 
issue I was leading up to. Let us look at that issue. Who will 
get the Russian Press House? If the Federal Assembly gets it -- 
and I understand that this could be justified -- where will the 
newspapers and the journalists go? 
  [Samokhvalov] Where will they go? I think that there must be 
an administrative building available in Moscow. Just take a 
look. Only recently the Ministry of Security was eliminated. 
This means a complex of buildings on Dzerzhinskiy Square. 
  [Lomakin] But you know that the time between the publication 
of the edict on the elimination of the ministry and the vacating 
of the buildings may amount to several years. I think that this 
is what will happen. 
  [Samokhvalov] The Ministry of Information and the Press has 
also been eliminated. It occupied a building in the very center 
where the editorial offices of the newspapers NOVOYE VREMYA, 
MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, NOVYY MIR, and so forth traditionally have 
been located. I think that the journalists could very easily 
move into the premises of the eliminated departments. I think 
that this problem is a little far-fetched. 
  [Lomakin] Vasiliy Grigoriyevich, thank you. We do not have 
much time left, so I must say that I am satisfied only by one 
thing, and that is the fact that television journalists will 
probably not have to vacate this building next year. 
  [Samokhvalov] I hope not. I would also like to express my 
hope that you will more actively defend the rights of television 
viewers on the basis of a knowledge of your own rights as 
journalists. I hope that next year this building will not come 
under fire, either from weapons or public opinion. I count on 
the formation of public councils at state television and radio 
companies which will ensure mutual links between state 
television and television viewers. I wish you every success. 
  [Lomakin] Thank you, Vasiliy Grigoriyevich. I hope that we 
will work together with you because journalists need 
professional lawyers like never before. Our guest was Vasiliy 
Grigoriyevich Samokhvalov, head of one of the independent 
information agencies known as ROSSIYSKOYE PRAVO [Russian Law]. 
Thank you. 
  [Samokhvalov] All the best.

<F P=106> [By Sergey Omelchenko and Yevgeniy Shmatrikov; from the </F>
"Novosti" newscast] 
  [Text] [Omelchenko over video of power industry 
installations including control room of Russia's unified power 
grid] Naturally, the financial crisis has cast a shadow over 
the power engineers' professional holiday. Consumers owe the 
industry more than 2 trillion rubles. Nonetheless, our unique 
power complex continues to function smoothly, without 
disruptions. 
  The 50-hertz reading on the central control panel of 
Russia's 
unified power grid indicates that the power grid is operating 
stably. The stable operation is the result not just of good 
equipment and the harmonious operation of the collective, but 
also of credits, big credits. Will these, together with the 
fairly steep interest rates, not have to be shouldered by 
consumers next year? 
  [A.F. Dyakov, president of the "Russia's Unified Power Grid" 
Russian Joint Stock Company] The bill for the credits should be 
footed by defaulters. In that case disciplined consumers would 
be protected. Their electricity rates would remain unchanged. 
  [Omelchenko] Despite all the financial difficulties, new 
capacities totaling 3,000,000 kW have been commissioned during 
the current year. That is quite a lot. There are big plans 
also for the coming year. Russo-German joint-production modern, 
economical gas turbines are being assembled in St. Petersburg, 
the North Caucasus, and Novgorod. Construction is continuing of 
the state regional electric power stations at Khoro-Nor in Chita 
Oblast, Nizhnevartovsk in Tyumen Oblast, and in Pskov, and also 
the Severnaya Heat and Electric Power Station in Moscow. 
  Power engineers are paying a lot of attention to energy 
saving. So, for example, the (?Cryocor) Joint Stock Company is 
planning to commission a turbo-expander installation at the No. 
21 Heat and Electric Power Station in the capital in the new 
year. This installation converts the gas energy in trunk gas 
pipelines into electricity and in addition produces cryogenic 
products -- nitrogen, oxygen, argon, xenon, and so forth. 
  [Dyakov] We have 600 such power stations. So there is a 
great deal of scope for employing these turbo-expanders as 
energy-saving technologies. 
  [Omelchenko] You have a new control panel here at the 
central control room. This is a showcase of the electronic 
equipment which is operating in Russia's power grid today. 
  [Dyakov] What is important is not just the hardware but also 
the software, and we have developed it ourselves. 
  [Omelchenko] The intellectual basis of the power industry is 
being created by the sector's leading scientific research 
institutes in cooperation with the Professor Solomatin Software 
Institute. 
  [Dyakov] Thanks to our comprehensive collective we have been 
able to operate reliably, and I hope that we will always be able 
to operate reliably.

<F P=106> [Article by Finance Minister Boris Fedorov: "The Dollar </F>
Will Cost 10,000 Rubles If We Back Down From the Reforms. That 
is Finance Minister Boris Fedorov's New Year's Prediction"] 
  [Text] The present financial policy is provoking a harsh 
reaction from the opposition. That means that a consistent 
financial policy has been achieved. 
  Prices over the past year rose by a factor of nine (they 
rose 
by a factor of 26 in 1992), and in December the rate of price 
rises was for the first time just 12 percent. These results 
could have been much better had it not been for the compromises 
on the budget, the promises of new appropriations not backed up 
by sources of finance, the artificial raising of purchase prices 
for grain, and our continuous struggle with the Supreme Soviet, 
the Central Bank, and sector lobbies in the government. 
  The lowering of inflation means easing the problem of the 
shortage of circulating capital and the depreciation of savings 
and investments. That is why the slump in production last year 
was not as great as the opposition predicted. However, 900 
percent inflation is still disastrously high and it is simply 
ridiculous to say that we have an unduly harsh policy or shock 
therapy here. Only incompetent or dishonest people can argue 
this way. It is typical that in all sectors without exception 
the average wage in 1993 rose faster than inflation. 
  Back at the beginning of the year we were criticized for the 
excessively low and unrealistic ruble exchange rate. But from 
June through the end of the year the rate only fell from 1,100 
rubles [R] to the dollar to R1,250 to $1; in other words, by 
just 10 percent as against an approximately fourfold rise in 
prices. Our prices are rapidly approaching the world level, 
which marks the end of the era of prosperity for inefficient 
production units whose survival was made possible by the vast 
price discrepancy. Now there are many who dislike the 
strengthening of the ruble even though this is a direct method 
of combating the export of our national wealth at knockdown 
prices. 
  The time has come to ask many prestigious directors of giant 
enterprises and captains of agriculture: What is your labor 
productivity like, why should we support you if your goods are 
selling at world prices while you pay people kopeks? I consider 
it a violation of human rights when I am forced to buy a 
commodity at a price higher than the world price and furthermore 
when it does not come up to scratch. 
  In 1993 we managed to stop the flow of money, subsidies, and 
credits to CIS countries despite the fierce resistance of the 
Central Bank and a number of members of the government. 
  In 1993, despite the opposition of the Central Bank and 
various sector lobbies, we managed to substantially raise 
interest rates and reduce various types of benefits which always 
go to the least strong and efficient and are then wasted. What 
effect did this have? In the first place the savings of the 
population and enterprises are now far better protected against 
inflation. Second, the voracious demand for free credits from 
the "black holes" in the Russian economy has been greatly 
restricted. It is no secret that behind the fine slogans of 
support for this sphere or that, what happens is that state 
resources are frankly plundered. 
  I do not know who will be at the helm of Russia's financial 
policy in 1994 -- that is up to the president and the premier to 
decide -- but I believe that it is necessary to demand 
absolutely concrete steps and commitments from those who lay 
claim to power. I would consider the following to be the minimum 
program for 1994: 

  - 
  -  the population's savings: Interest rates higher than the 
rate of inflation must be ensured so that savings really do grow 
and people are able to accumulate money for long-term purchases. 
Until that happens there will be no investments or industrial 
development. At the same time it is necessary to pay reasonable 
compensation for losses in savings resulting from the 
deregulation of January 1992, but this must be done using 
noninflationary sources; 
  -  the population's real incomes must rise by at least 20-30 
percent, and the dollar equivalent of the average monthly wage 
must rise from $100 to $250: It is necessary to introduce tax 
regulators to reduce the discrepancy in earnings between the 
richest and the poorest; 
  -  inflation must be reduced in the very near future to less 
than 5 percent a month, which is equivalent to 80 percent 
annually. That will make it possible to reduce the general 
level of interest rates, stimulate investments, and encourage 
enterprises to plan their activity; 
  -  as the budget deficit falls to 5 percent of GDP or less and 
is financed by market loans it will be possible to reduce the 
tax burden on commodity producers; 
  -  if events develop favorably the foreign exchange rate of the 
ruble in 1994 will not fall below R2,000-2,500 to the dollar, 
which will make our exports more substantial, will facilitate 
imports, and will make enterprises think about competitiveness, 
productivity, and quality. At the same time all the remaining 
restrictions on exports should be completely lifted. 

    Those are the most basic financial policy demands in 1994. 
Will those responsible be bold enough to make these commitments 
and then answer for them to the people? 
  I have studied the opposition's demands and programs closely 
and I have come to the conclusion that in the financial sphere 
no one is offering anything fundamentally new apart from a 
sharp increase in expenditure (social needs, investments, 
and so forth). I wholeheartedly support such expenditure. 
However, no one is saying anything serious about where 
the money for this expenditure is to come from. That means 
just one thing -- a further increase in the budget deficit and 
consequently a further rise in inflation. And inflation, let me 
repeat for the hundredth time, hits real people, enterprises, 
and the whole state in the pocket. 
  On the eve of the new year, 1994, I shall try to predict 
what 
will happen if there is a change of course. A change of policy 
and the rejection of the more than moderate course pursued by us 
in 1993 (and accordingly the rejection of the people identified 
with that policy because a policy is always pursued by specific 
people) will mean the "Ukrainianization" of our economy: 

  - 
  -  prices rising annually by a factor of 20; 
  -  an exchange rate in the region of R10,000 to the dollar (the 
rate could be fixed, so that would be the "black market" rate); 
  -  a further decline in labor productivity; 
  -  a fall in the population's real money incomes by at least 
one-eighth (in 1993 the rise was 10 percent); the average wage 
would fall to the dollar equivalent of $50 a month; 
  -  savings and investments would contract in real terms; 
  -  the dollarization of the economy would intensify again; 
  -  certain prices would be fixed and there would be an attempt 
to confiscate money, particularly foreign currency, held in 
banks; 
  -  there would be another shortage of many types of goods, the 
stores would be empty, and emigration would increase. 

    I think that instead of the enormous market around the Kiev 
station in Moscow, where Ukrainians, hunting for rubles which 
have become a genuine foreign currency, are to be found selling 
masses of goods, there would be a similar market in Kiev where 
you might find Russians trading, hunting for "karbovantsy." I 
do not rule out the possibility that our miners would go to 
Kazakhstan to earn their living, just as Ukrainians now come to 
Rostov to work for half pay. Perhaps our delegation would then 
go to Tashkent to ask for credits and Russian enterprises would 
try to keep their money salted away in Belarusian banks. 
  The only possible consolation for our opponents would the 
growth of production by 3-5 percent by increasing the production 
of tanks and missiles. Admittedly, I do not think that this 
will be a source of much new year's joy for Russia's citizens as 
we approach 1994. 
  I do not believe people who change their views, who pursue 
one line today and are ready to pursue a different one tomorrow. 
I have no faith in the leaders of enterprises who forget about 
labor productivity and production efficiency and know only one 
way to resolve their problems -- by asking the president or the 
premier for money. All that we have is the interests of the 
state and our citizens, and they are demanding that rigorous 
financial order be instilled in the country and that the reforms 
be continued, reforms whose sole aim is the improvement of our 
life. 
  At most 10 percent of the people in the old parliament 
supported the reforms; now that figure is at least 30 percent. 
That is not so bad for a beginning. The only way to stop things 
coming to a standstill is to firmly accelerate the reforms and 
move closer to a normal life worthy of the citizens of a great 
country. Slowing down the reforms is the road to ruin, the 
continuation of the time of troubles, and the betrayal of 
Russia's national interests. 
  Enough of the deception and disappointment. Enough of the 
promises. Enough of the people who cling onto their jobs 
despite being totally incapable of anything constructive. 
Enough of the attempts to cross the hedgehog with the grass 
snake -- as is well known, all you get is barbed wire. The 
elections were a warning to us. 
  Pray God that Russia does not turn back from the true path 
again, especially as the most difficult steps have already been 
taken and we have the strength to go on.

<F P=106> [Gennadiy Yastrebtsov article under the "Economic Barometer" </F>
rubric: "Landfall Still Fog-Bound"] 
  [Text] More and more sober-minded economists, even among 
those formerly opposed to Soviet power, are coming to the sad 
conclusion that the monetarists have led the country into the 
quagmire of a very severe economic crisis. The authors and 
proponents of "shock therapy" continue to claim that everything 
is fine and that, although we may be bogged down for the time 
being, we will gradually reach terra firma.... 
  So what can we expect in 1994? Even going by the official 
Ministry of the Economy forecasts, there will be a further drop 
in the population's real income. And the middle class -- the 
largest group, on whose shoulders the national economy has 
always depended -- will be hit hardest. In the new year 
approximately 33 percent of the population will have a per 
capita income less than the minimum wage, and the difference in 
income levels between our poorest fellow citizens and the new 
fat cats will increase 11-fold. Academician S. Shatalin, the 
well-known "marketeer," has said the following: "The Russian 
Government is pursuing a not very well-conceived or responsible 
policy in this area. Governments throughout the civilized world 
regulate the population's income, and nobody considers this a 
violation of the laws of the development of the market 
economy...." 
  Take the United States, for instance. Business circles there 
reacted loyally to the ousting of the right-wing Republican 
government by the center-right Democrats. They were hopeful of 
tipping the balance between the "market" and "nonmarket" sectors 
of society toward a better resolution of the social problems 
which have deteriorated even in that prosperous country as a 
result of the latest economic crisis. According to information 
published in BIRZHEVYYE VEDOMOSTI by Yevgeniy Boshnyakov, 
director of the "Issledovateli Rynka" enterprise, America has 
its own macroeconomists, whom our "apprentices" imitate. The 
U.S. Democrats even involved some of them in their election 
campaign. But, once victory was assured, none of them was taken 
into the leadership -- electioneering is one thing, while 
actually running a state is quite another. That is why in 
America the transition did not result in any shocks or general 
confrontation between such usually hostile forces as 
entrepreneurs, workers, and the nonmarket section of society. 
  Russia has done the same as America, only...back to front -- 
power has been handed over to extremists from science and 
production. And, naturally, society has suffered a terrible 
shock, the economy is in an unprecedented crisis, and the 
executive is meeting with opposition and hostility from such 
economically different forces as state and private employers, 
stockbrokers and bankers, the military and pensioners. 
  What now? Despite the fact that the mutual offsetting of 
debts is anathema to government officials, this will clearly be 
unavoidable in the new year, otherwise we will have 
hyperinflation again -- but this time because of the wholesale 
reduction in commodity supply. In the opinion of the well-known 
economist Algimantas Lebedinskas [name as transliterated], 
squeezing the money supply in absolute terms after reducing the 
supply of goods is a sheer illusion. Moreover, the country can 
expect mass unemployment -- requiring state spending that the 
state budget will hardly be able to withstand owing to the tax 
collection shortfall. 
  So the Russian economy can look forward not to stabilization 
-- as the monetarist reformers stubbornly promise -- but new 
upheavals. Perhaps even stronger upheavals than last year.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Prokopenko: "Have We Started To Live </F>
Better?"] 
  [Text] Let he who says we have not be the first to cast a 
stone at me. Previously, in pre-perestroyka times, any news of 
another price increase was seen as almost a nationwide tragedy. 
But now we even make jokes about it: If they assure us that 
prices will not rise that is the first sign that another leap is 
imminent. Is that not evidence of mounting optimism? 
  Therefore the news of the New Year "gifts" from the subway 
workers (a subway trip will cost 50 rubles as of 1 January) and 
from the municipal employees and communications workers 
(telephone payments have increased threefold) was received as a 
stable sign of a market economy making itself felt. 
  Moreover, the statisticians see a positive sign in this 
response. For instance, a poll of 1,000 Russians held on New 
Year's Eve by the institute of comparative social studies showed 
that for the first time in the past three years the majority of 
those polled believe that the quality of their food intake has 
not deteriorated, that life last year, although it did not 
improve, did, in their opinion, stabilize somewhat. 
  The number of "pessimists" believing that the situation has 
become worse declined to a record level -- 57 percent (71 
percent in 1992). Probably they have swelled the numbers of 
those who believe that life has not changed. And their numbers 
have increased by one third, reaching 29 percent. The cohort of 
optimists, whose lives improved last year, has increased by a 
whole 2 percent. They number 13 percent. As we can see, we 
have no problems with the growth of optimism. 
  Incidentally, there is no unity either in the economists' 
camp. Thus, some believe that the multiple increase in prices on 
the consumer market, inflation, the ruble which has decreased in 
values tens of times over, and the overwhelming production slump 
have made Russians' lives considerably worse. But others, 
including Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar, assert that despite 
everything their fellow citizens' prosperity has increased 
tenfold. It is true that they rely not on the opinion of these 
fellow citizens but on specific figures: Whereas in 1991 
Russians' average wages in hard currency equivalent were $7, the 
figure now is $70. 
  I remember the nostalgic words of a woman of my 
acquaintance: 
"I want 1982 and my 120 rubles wages!..." Probably there is 
something this woman fails to understand. 
  Meanwhile, happy New Year and happy new prices!

<F P=106> [New Year's address by Prime Minister Patsatsia; read by </F>
announcer] 
  [Text] Dear compatriots: 1993 will soon be gone. It was 
the hardest year for the Georgian people, when the fate of 
Georgian statehood was hanging in balance. Political 
cataclysms, rampant separatism, internal disorder, and betrayal 
had a negative effect on the country's agriculture, which was in 
difficulties because of both objective and subjective reasons. 
  The country's industrial potential dwindled so dramatically 
that it can now produce at only 20 percent capacity. Social 
discomfort and peoples' hardships reached a critical limit. Yet 
1993 was the year of Georgia's salvation. It was the year of 
bravery of Georgia's sons and the halo on the ascension of 
Georgia's soul. It was the year of true democracy, the victory 
over an attempt to establish neo-Bolshevism, and the final turn 
toward the irreversible process of Georgia's unity. 
  Georgia's Cabinet of Ministers believes that the practical 
measures carried out in 1993 for minimally accommodating the 
social security of the socially insecure strata were not enough. 
We are hoping to use all of our efforts and resources to 
resolve this issue next year. I would like to tell you that as 
of 1 February wages will rise considerably. 
  You know that as a result of the head of state's efforts and 
through his immediate participation, many countries around the 
world extended a helping hand to us and alleviated our situation 
considerably. This aid will continue, but we can be saved only 
if Georgia's economy is restored and if it starts to function at 
full force. The prospect for this has become a reality as a 
result of the agreements signed in Ashgabat. Serious investment 
in the republic's economy by individual concerns and firms is 
emerging. The only indespensible condition for a full 
functioning of the country's potential abilities is, of course, 
stabilization. 
  Georgia's cabinet of ministers will do its best to secure 
stability in 1994. I would like to assure you that a battle 
against mafia clans and organized crime will be stepped up even 
more. 
  The New Year will enter everyone's homes in several hours. 
  May it carry peace, kindness, and happiness for all of you. 
  I wish you a Happy New Year. 
  Otar Patsatsia, prime minister of the Republic of Georgia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Giorgi Chanturia, chairman of </F>
the National-Democratic Party, NDP, by Murman Jguburia; place 
and date not given: "Why Are Everyone's Hopes Pinned On the 
Arrival of Spring"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Jguburia] Could you say a 
few words about the Geneva memorandum [signed between Georgia 
and Abkhazia on 1 December]? 
  [Chanturia] It was our wish that a Georgian delegation 
should go to Geneva. Of course, we are not naive and did not 
expect that, as a result of these negotiations, Abkhazia would 
be returned to us and that those who were forcibly displaced 
would return to their own land. 
  Diplomatic work is also necessary. Some radically-minded 
people say that they do not want any negotiations, which, of 
course, is wrong. However, we should not go to the other 
extreme. Unfortunately, in reality, the return of Abkhazia is 
probably only possible by military force; nevertheless, 
diplomacy should contribute to the victory of Georgian weapons 
and to the subsequent consolidation of this victory. In this 
way, the meeting in Geneva would have been more significant had 
Georgia been better prepared. Unfortunately, in my view, this 
memorandum is not serious; it does not correspond to our 
interests and is unacceptable to our state. What is the sense of 
holding a meeting just for the sake of it? 
  [Jguburia] You probably know what happened during your 
absence concerning the bread situation; it has become more 
acute; people are joking that those behind the acts of sabotage 
must be magicians as it has been impossible to find them.... 
  [Chanturia] We really cannot blame Russia for this 
situation. This is our fault. It is an institute of state 
violence. When reason and morality have no effect upon a part 
of society or specific individuals, the state is obliged to use 
force to put a halt to illegal actions. 
  What is happening in our country...? Members of the mafia 
appear on television and speak about the mafia; bread thieves 
appear on television and speak about bread thieves; robbers 
speak about the evils of robbery. That is to say, these people 
have installed themselves in fairly high echelons of the state 
structures. I doubt that we will achieve any serious measure of 
success in the struggle against the mafia unless new people come 
to power. Believe me, it is possible to resolve this problem 
within a month. We simply have to catch certain people. Those 
giving protection to the Tatishvilis [bandit gang] must be 
caught first. The "big fish" have to be caught before the small 
ones. In Georgia, the "small fish" are being caught while the 
"big fish" wander about free. 
  Everything here is done unsystematically, including the 
struggle against crime. I repeat, it is possible to establish 
order in Georgia but this can only be done by new people who are 
not connected with the mafia and who do not take money from 
criminals. When one's conscience is clear, one can arrest 
someone and punish him if need be. There is great support for 
the truth. 
  [Jguburia] Batono [Georgian polite form of address] Giorgi, 
people believe that the current Parliament is not the one that 
Georgia needs and are thinking about new elections.... 
  [Chanturia] Parliament is, to put it mildly, far removed 
from international standards. This "is not a new one but an old 
one." However, does the government look any better?! Is there, 
in general, any structure in Georgia that is more or less 
civilized? Unfortunately, there is not. It is the fault of the 
electorate for chosing such a parliament. Blocs are formed and 
called "Mshvidoba," [Peace], "Siqvaruli," [Love], "Aqvaveba," 
[Well-Being], and "Gapurchkvna," [Prosperity], one or two 
popular composers or "violinists" are made their leaders, and 
people vote for these blocs, which have been formed artificially 
and soon disappear. These people may be prominent cultural 
figures but many of them understand nothing when it comes to 
politics. Parliament is a place for politicians. [passage 
omitted] 
  As regards early elections, of course, they are necessary. 
The elections should be held according to party lists. We 
should introduce strict barriers: 5 percent for parties and 10 
percent for blocs. Whoever fails to overcome these barriers 
will not be able to have any representatives in Parliament. 
Parliament will be composed of [the members of] three or four 
parties, which will be a step forward. We also have to learn 
that the government is not an economic mechanism. Ministers 
should be politicians and, moreover, party members as, in this 
case, there will be greater responsibility. When the government 
is formed on the basis of party principles, then it is already a 
united team. [passage omitted] 
  [Jguburia] If it is not inappropriate..., speaking of 
professionalism, was the sudden formation of the "Union of 
[Georgia's] Citizens" not premature? It must take a lot of time 
and work to form a party. A union of like-minded persons is 
formed slowly and gradually, according to what the party's 
concept, orientation, point of view, and aims are.... As soon 
as the "Union of Citizens" was formed, people flocked to it. 
They probably blindly trust the head of state and have faith in 
him, and that is the reason for joining it in a hurry. People 
can probably be forgiven this. However, was such haste on the 
part of the head of state not a little inappropriate? 
  If we take a look at the path pursued by the NDP, we can see 
what a difficult one it had to follow. The NDP needed almost 70 
years to become a strong party. 
  [Chanturia] What is formed quickly disappears just as 
quickly. We can mention the Rustaveli Society, to which 
collective membership was possible. Unfortunately, the society 
has become a fiction, something that awaits the "Union of 
Citizens" and others such as the Party of Reformers, the 
Progressive-Democratic Party, and groupings that were formed 
ostentatiously and artificially, all with different interests. 
[passage omitted] 
  Of course, Shevardnadze should have a party and he himself 
should be a party member since he is the head of state. I have 
often said that it is nonsense that the head of state should 
stand apart from his own political force. There is nothing 
incomprehensible about the desire of Shevardnadze himself to 
form a party. What is incomprehensible are the means and style 
in which all this was done and the hullabaloo surrounding it. 
This is neither a political force nor a movement. The election 
of a 200-strong presidium is, to put it mildly, a wholly 
apolitical step. I fear that the same fate awaits this 
organization that befell the Democratic Union (formed by 
Shevardnadze) and later the "Mshvidoba" bloc. This will place 
the head of state himself in an unenviable position. We are 
interested in having strong and firmly established rule in 
Georgia. The defeat of the "Union of Citizens" could lead to a 
more serious political defeat and this, naturally, does not 
correspond to our aims. 
  [Jguburia] It has not been possible to start a period of 
construction in our country. Gamsakhurdia destroyed and divided 
everything. The forum [as published] was split, families were 
split, and brother was set against sister. There was an attempt 
to set regions against one another but this, thank God, did not 
succeed. 
  Today, when people take a nostalgic look at the recent past, 
they see Shevardnadze also more as a destroyer than a builder. 
In their view, Shevardnadze and Gamsakhurdia are both 
destroyers. The first destroyed the empire, which was vitally 
necessary, and also made German unification possible through the 
destruction of the famous "wall." The second destroyed his own 
motherland, which led us to civil war. One can say that neither 
is the very image of Aghmashenebeli [king of Georgia 1089-1125]. 
Davit Aghmashenebeli was devoted, first and foremost, to 
domestic affairs. He made Georgians love work and religion. He 
created a powerful army and, when it became necessary to launch 
an offensive against the enemy, he blocked off their roads of 
retreat and, naturally, won a great victory. Incidentally, 
probably the time has finally come to create a united army in 
Georgia, do you not think? 
  [Chanturia] How can a united army be created when certain 
criminals in military uniform are being awarded medals and 
decorations? The impunity syndrome reigns not only in the army 
but everywhere in society. A person can be a traitor or in 
alliance with the enemy and he will still be decorated, offered 
a post, and not be short of respect and glory. 
  That atmosphere that prevails in the higher echelons of 
power 
and also at a relatively lower level stimulates this immorality, 
irresponsibility, and non-state activity. 
  Let us return to the subject of the CIS. A wholly non-state 
attitude also exists toward such an important question as 
Georgia's membership of the CIS. Let us recall what Russian 
historians themselves have said. [passage omitted] 
  Russians write that a Russian will not abandon the empire 
and, at the same time, an equal alliance between the people of 
the empire and its former or current satellite states is 
impossible. 
  [Jguburia] You often quote from Mazzini in your speeches. I 
recall one phrase: It is impossible to think about harmony, 
understanding, and Christianity in a country where one person is 
very poor and one is very rich (let us take our coupon and the 
Russian ruble). 
  People here think that we apparently need Russia very much. 
When they need to justify joining the CIS, they say that, just 
as we cannot do without Russia, so it cannot do without us. 
  [Chanturia] In general, it would be better if Georgia and 
Georgian politicians did not view matters from the point of view 
of having to justify themselves. I am grieved that certain 
people do not intend to acknowledge that joining the CIS 
represents a defeat. If, only a short while ago, it meant a 
defeat and a humiliation, how did it become a great political 
step following the loss, destruction, division, and ruin of 
Abkhazia? Why are we deceiving ourselves? 
  [Jguburia] Such a view exists: Why should we not join the 
CIS when such and such a state belongs to it...? When I 
overhear such a statement, it immediately brings to mind one of 
our sayings: "He is not stupid who has put the unripe corn in 
the attic but he who has befriended him." Joking apart, they 
also say that Batoni Shevardnadze apparently joined the CIS so 
that he could take on a different mission, which will benefit 
not only us but also others.... As regards the attitude of 
members of our government to the CIS, their hesitancy was 
exposed in a masterly way by Kalbatoni [Georgian polite form of 
address] Irina Sarishvili [Chanturia's wife, former vice premier 
who resigned in protest against Shevardnadze's decision to join 
the CIS] during two sessions of Parliament. 
  [Chanturia] There are people in the government who not 
only hold the CIS close to their hearts but also would gladly 
welcome the restoration of the Soviet Union in any form. I am 
convinced that Shevardnadze did not want this but, as a result 
of mistakes made and proceeding from objective or subjective 
reality and what took shape in our country, it became necessary 
to take this step. However, we should be frank and say that 
this is a defeat. The very fact that, following our being 
dragged into the CIS, we lost Abkhazia and Gamsakhurdia returned 
to Georgia and inflicted a civil war [upon the country] shows 
that this is a defeat. We nevertheless have to say this so that 
we can leave something for posterity. 
  Our moderate position regarding relations with Russia is 
known to you. We are categorically opposed to anti-Russian 
hysteria but this does not mean that we would conduct a 
pro-Russian and antistate policy and leave the flag, emblem, and 
anthem as vestiges of our independence. When we speak of an 
antistate approach, this characterizes a certain section of our 
society, people who are collaborators by nature. Consumed with 
revanchist feelings and hiding behind anti-Gamsakhurdia 
sentiments, they are now bent on wrecking the ideals of the 
national movement (that date from the time of Ilia 
Chavchavadze). Nevertheless, I believe that Shevardnadze has 
sufficient forces and will free himself of this entourage; this 
is essential for him, as a politician, so that he can get a 
realistic view of the existing situation in Georgia. I have 
witnessed how people have been feeding him with disinformation 
and painting a picture that does not exist in reality. When one 
is given incorrect information, this causes one to take 
incorrect steps. Naturally, we have to be very wary and correct 
in our relations with Russia but we should not compromise our 
state interests. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tbilisi, 1 Jan -- In the new year, Georgia will make 
an attempt to partially surmount its acute energy crisis by 
using local resources. According to official sources, foreign 
companies are being invited in for this purpose, and they will 
start to locate and develop oilfields within the republic. To 
ensure the safety of the foreign geologists, Eduard 
Shevardnadze, the head of state, has already instructed that 
their protection should be entrusted to the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. 
  Georgia used to meet its fuel needs through cheap supplies 
from other republics of the former Soviet Union, receiving from 
them nearly all the natural gas it required, a significant 
amount of its petrol and diesel fuel, and a quarter of its 
electrical power. All this despite the fact, for example, that 
Georgia is thought by local experts to lead the world as regards 
the presence of hydropower resources. 
  Geologists forecast that rich oil-bearing strata can also be 
found in the republic, as, for example, in neighboring 
Azerbaijan. Over 70 years ago, the then bourgeois government of 
Georgia issued a Dutch firm with a licence to locate and extract 
oil in the east of the republic. But these fields were soon 
exhausted. In recent years, oil-bearing strata have been 
detected in a seam close to the surface on an upland plateau not 
far from Tbilisi.

  [Text] Tbilisi January 4 TASS--Georgian commercial bodies 
are panicked by persistent rumours that 50,000-rouble banknotes 
of the Russian Central Bank will be shortly withdrawn from 
circulation in the republic. Shopkeepers refuse to accept or 
change them for other money. Smart dealers swap such banknotes 
for 20 per cent of the sum exchanged. 
  Local financial experts suggest two reasons for the panic. 
Firstly, it might have been caused by Moscow press reports that 
the Russian market is flooded by forged 50,000-rouble banknotes. 
Secondly, it could have been caused artificially by local shady 
businessmen, who waxed rich last summer by cheaply buying up 
1961-1992 Russian roubles, which were then being withdrawn from 
circulation.

  [Text] Moscow, Jan 3 (AFP) -- Estonia expressed concern 
Monday [3 January] at comments by Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin on protecting Russian-speakers in former Soviet 
republics, accusing the Russian government of destroying 
democracy in Russia. 
  "We would draw the attention of the international community 
to these declarations, which probably mark the end of democracy 
in Russia," the statement by the Estonian parliament said, 
referring to New Year's eve comments by Yeltsin. 
  "Russia is choosing to emphasize so-called discrimination 
against Russian-speakers. This risks a gradual hardening of 
relations between the two countries. We must remain vigilant," 
the statement, released to AFP by a spokesman of the parliament, 
said. 
  Yeltsin addressed a part of his New Year's message to 
Russians living outside Russia, stressing that their rights 
would be protected. 
  On Monday ITAR-TASS quoted Yeltsin's spokesman Vyacheslav 
Kostikov as saying he wanted to protect "the rights of Russians 
and the Russian-speaking population within the framework of 
international law and based on the notion of pan-national 
solidarity." 
  The comments were seen as a threat to the Baltic republics 
of 
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, which have large Russian-speaking 
minorities. 
  On Saturday the three states called on Yeltsin to ensure the 
complete withdrawal of Russian troops from their soil by the end 
of the year. All Russian forces have already left Lithuania, 
but a number of units are still stationed in the other two 
states. 
  The three states voiced concern last month when 
ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy made an unexpectedly strong showing in legislative 
elections.

  [Text] President Lennart Meri expressed his concern with 
the new year's greetings of Russian President Yeltsin, pointing 
out that Russia may introduce a "new and aggressive foreign 
policy" this year. Meri referred to a promise by President 
Yeltsin to the Russians living outside Russia to defend their 
"common interests" with more energy and resolution. 
  "Yeltsin's expressions and intonation give reason for 
suspicion that the democratic forces are too weak in Russia and 
Russia will adopt the aggressive foreign policy of the former 
Soviet Union," Meri said. He called for the Western countries to 
react this "unusual" speech and warned that the Russian 
leadership may exploit the extremist Zhirinovskiy's election 
success as a pretext for hard-line policy towards the former 
Soviet republics. Although Russia is entitled to concern for its 
citizens' safety, it would be impossible to imagine the 
Russians' interests in New York as belonging to Russia's sphere 
of interest, Meri pointed out in an interview to the Associated 
Press. He also drew parallels to the protection of "Russian 
minority" in 1939. 
  The Baltic states presidents made a joint statement on 
December 31. They called for President Yeltsin to keep his 
promise on the completion of the Russian troops withdrawal from 
Latvia and Estonia in 1994. The presidents also invited the 
world to contribute to the Russian military withdrawal.

  [Excerpt] Tallinn, January 3 -- Russia has promised to 
remove nuclear fuel from its former submarine training base at 
Paldiski, north west Estonia, by midsummer, an advisor to the 
Estonian Foreign Ministry and member of the Estonian delegation 
at Estonian-Russian inter-state negotiations told ETA. 
  "Under a plan submitted by the Russian counterpart, nuclear 
fuel should be removed from Paldiski by June 30 this year," Mark 
Sinisoo said. 
  Russia has thus far followed the timetable of dismantling 
nuclear equipment, Sinisoo added. At the end of last year, 
Russia sent equipment and materials for dismantling nuclear 
devices to Estonia and another wagon is due to arrive in January. 
  "Following removal of nuclear fuel, Paldiski does not need 
Russian military presence and the so-called military dismantling 
should be decided at Estonian-Russian negotiations," Sinisoo 
said while adding that Paldiski must be integrated into Estonia.

  [Text] TALLINN, Jan 03, BNS - Maj. Gen. Aleksander 
Einseln, the commander of the Estonian Defense Forces, appointed 
Col. Raul Luks as the commandant of Paldiski. The commandant 
assumed his post as of Jan. 1. 
  The commandant's task is to promote the withdrawal of the 
Russian troops, nuclear reactors and the submarine training base 
from Paldiski and the Pakri peninsula. He must also see to the 
establishment of Estonian laws in the town whose population 
consists mainly of aliens and the Russian military. 
  The commandant's tasks include securing cooperation between 
Estonian defense forces, border guards and the police in 
Paldiski, and preventing the looting of vacated Russian military 
facilities. 
  Luks was the deputy chief of staff of the Estonian Defense 
Forces before his appointment to Paldiski. 
  The Russian 93rd naval training base and its two nuclear 
reactors still remain in Paldiski. About 500 soldiers and 
officers were stationed there at the end of last year. Russian 
naval depots and a supplies company are also stationed in 
Paldiski. 
  The North Infantry Company represents the Estonian Defense 
Forces in Paldiski.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 03, BNS -- The Estonian parliament's 
Pro Patria faction met Monday to discuss the upcoming changes in 
the government. The party is expected to put its proposals to 
its coalition partners tomorrow. 
  The meeting was attended by Estonian Prime Minister Mart 
Laar. The government's press service declined to comment on the 
outcome of the discussion to BNS. Members of Parliament (MPs) 
Jaanus Betlem and Toivo Jurgenson, members of Pro Patria, also 
refused to comment. 
  According to information in the Estonian press, four 
ministers are expected to be replaced. Defense Minister Juri 
Luik will replace Foreign Minister Trivimi Velliste. 
  The defense portfolio will pass to MP Indrek Kannik. Finance 
Minister Madis Uurike will be replaced by Heiki Kranich, a 
member of the parliament's Liberal faction, and Toivo Jurgenson, 
a Pro Patria parliamentary faction member, is expected to 
replace Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae. 
  Under the coalition agreement, all the four portfolios 
belong 
to Pro Patria. The new appointments, however, will have to be 
approved by the coalition council that is expected to meet 
Tuesday. 
  The Cabinet reshuffle will probably take place before the 
parliament reconvenes Jan. 10, so the new ministers can be sworn 
in immediately.

assumed plans to replace him in the government. 
  The Estonian Association of Small Enterprises (EVEA) and the 
Estonian Chamber of Trade and Commerce held an emergency meeting 
at the end of last year to discuss reports on his possible 
dismissal and sent a letter to President Lennart Meri and Prime 
Minister saying that replacing Sildmae at the present stage of 
economic reform is premature and dangerous to the country. 
  Sildmae as a competent minister has done a lot to overcome 
economic crisis and has launched an effective restructuring of 
state-owned business, the letter said. The two organisations 
unite over 1,500 Estonian companies. 
  EVEA awarded Sildmae 1993 "Entrepreneur's Friend" prize. 
  Estonian media has recently reported that Sildmae would be 
replaced on political grounds. Sildmae, a former member of the 
communist party, does not belong to any political parties.

  [Text] Tallinn, Jan 03, BNS -- The Tartu-based Postimees 
daily commissioned in December a public opinion poll to find out 
the people's opinion on the issue of Estonia's eastern border. 
The EMOR market and opinion research center questioned 1,000 
people between 16 and 74 years of age of whom 62 percent were 
Estonians, 31 percent Russians, and 7 percent people of other 
nationalities. Those polled were asked to state whether they 
favored restoration of the pre-war border line or would agree to 
a compromise. 
  The poll showed that Estonians were divided on the issue: 53 
percent supported restoration of the border line as set under 
the Tartu Peace Treaty, while 40 percent were prepared to accept 
a compromise. The share of those supporting the pre-war border 
line was the greatest among the 16-24 and the 65-74 age groups 
as well as among the respondents who lack a secondary education. 
People with a higher education and those living in northeast 
Estonian towns were more inclined to accept a compromise. 
  Non-Estonians' attitudes toward the border issue differed 
from those of the Estonians: 69 percent were of the opinion that 
Estonia might accept a compromise and only 15 percent backed the 
restoration of the border line as set under the Tartu Peace 
Treaty. 
  The poll showed that, if the question were to be put on a 
referendum where all people over 16 living in Estonia could 
participate, 39 percent would back restoration of the pre-war 
border line and 52 percent would vote for a compromise. 
  The respondents who favored a compromise were also offered a 
choice between two compromises: giving up Ivangorod and the 
territories beyond the Narva River, or giving up the Petseri 
region. 
  The Estonians' and non-Estonians' positions differed 
cardinally. Most non-Estonians agreeing to a compromise -- 55 
percent -- would give up both the territories beyond the Narva 
River and the Petseri region. Estonians, on the other hand, are 
divided into two more or less equal groups: 32 percent would be 
prepared to surrender both territories, while 24 percent would 
agree to give up only Ivangorod and the other territories beyond 
the Narva River. Some 10 percent of Estonians and 11 percent of 
non-Estonians, who backed a compromise, suggested another 
option, while 25 percent of Estonians and 26 percent of 
non-Estonians failed to provide an answer.

  [Text] Tallinn, January 3 -- Estonian economy took a 
remarkable leap ahead in 1993, Siim Kallas, President of the 
Bank of Estonia said in his commentary to commercial Radio 2. 
  The biggest surprise was that Estonia's exports doubled in 
1993, Kallas said while adding that a three-per-cent increase in 
gross national product was a very good result. Kallas forecast 
similar growth for 1994. 
  Prime Minister Mart Laar told the same broadcast that 
Estonia 
made considerable progress towards normal society and state. 
  Last year was successful to Estonia both economically and 
politically, Laar said while adding that, hopefully, Estonia and 
the European Union would conclude free trade agreement in 1994. 
Estonia should also reach an agreement with NATO, Laar added.

  [Text] Tallinn, Dec 30, BNS -- A year ago 30,431 
businesses (institutions, public organizations and farms 
excluded) were registered in Estonia. Their number had grown to 
36,900 by last June and to 41,820 by November, the Economics 
Ministry reports in its 1993-1994 economic survey. 
  Some 10,000-12,000 new businesses will be established next 
year, economists predict, provided the regulations are not 
substantially changed. 
  The level of enterprise was the highest in the Tallinn area 
with 43 businesses per 1,000 people and the lowest in East 
Virumaa, where 12 businesses per 1,000 people were registered. 
Tallinn and Saaremaa showed the biggest increase in the number 
of registered companies, about seven enterprises per 1,000 
people in six months. 
  Experts estimate there will be over 40,000 unemployed and 
78,000 job seekers in Estonia early next year. They predict the 
growth of unemployment will stop in the second half of next 
year. Forecasts put the number of people employed in the 
Estonian economy next year at 600,000-650,000. 
  Personal income, according to revenues from personal income 
tax, is the biggest in northwest Estonia -- over 700 kroons, and 
the lowest in southeast Estonia, where it remains below 400 
kroons.

  [Text] Tallinn, Dec 29, BNS -- The Privatization Agency 
with its relatively limited number of staff is unable to carry 
out the privatization in due time and with sufficient expertise. 
Therefore it would be advisable that the preparation of some of 
the companies under the Ministry of Economics for privatization 
be referred to the ministry, which has the necessary 
specialists, the ministry says. 
  The Ministry of Economics in a survey of the country's 
economy for 1993-1994 says the privatization process needs more 
decentralization. Also experts from the ministry, as well as 
members of state company boards and other specialists in the 
respective fields should be given a greater role in the process, 
the document suggests. 
  The ministry contests demands by the country's farm sector 
to 
have the priority right for the purchase of food companies from 
the state. The survey says farm unions and associations often 
prove unable to avoid early bankruptcies of these companies or 
sell them to other buyers soon. 
  The survey warns that selling shares in state companies to 
private individuals for the compensation bonds instead of money 
may lead to a conservation of the present structure of the 
economy. The document says supporting institutions able to 
contribute to the concentration of capital, such as stock 
exchanges, investment funds etc. must be developed to avoid this. 
  The Economics Ministry report shows the situation in the 
country's retail sector in October 1993 as follows: 54 percent 
of stores were in private hands, 30 percent were owned by 
cooperatives, and only 8 percent remained state-owned. Also more 
than 80 percent of the service and catering enterprises were 
privatized by October. 
  Estonia sold about 36.5 million kroons worth of state 
companies into private hands in 1991 and 1992 together. The 
sales price of businesses privatized in the first 11 months of 
this year amounted to more than 350 million kroons. The total 
240 different companies and facilities sold under the so-called 
small privatization scheme accounted for 125 million kroons of 
the revenue. 
  In addition to this, the new owners have taken the 
obligation 
to put 154.5 million kroons into investments and retain 6,755 
jobs.

  [Text] TALLINN, Jan 03, BNS -- Estonia's taxation law, 
which establishes excises, income tax, gambling tax, gift and 
inheritance tax, turnover tax, land tax, social tax and customs 
tax as state taxes, took effect as of the beginning of the year. 
Most of the taxes are regulated under new laws adopted last 
year. 
  Besides state taxes, local governments may impose local 
taxes 
that are in force only in their territories. The local taxes are 
to be defined by a separate law that hasn't been passed yet. 
  The turnover tax law, which was amended last year, didn't 
change the 18-percent tax rate but trimmed the list of goods and 
services exempt from the tax. No turnover tax is imposed on the 
export of goods and services. The turnover tax was Estonia's 
biggest source of revenues at 2.26 billion kroons. 
  The income tax law, which was also amended last year, set 
the 
tax at 26 percent for both private persons and corporate bodies. 
The income tax is imposed also on income from interest, but the 
parliament ruled not to apply it this year. All wage earners are 
likely to benefit from the new rate. 
  The 40-percent gambling tax that replaced the former 
10-percent rate will be channeled into the state budget. It will 
be divided as follows: 30 percent to the National Culture 
Foundation, seven percent to the Red Cross, seven percent to the 
Children's Foundation, seven percent to the Child Protection 
Union, and 49 percent to the Chamber of the Disabled.

  [Text] A delegation from the Danish Ministry of Defense, 
headed by Minister Hans Haekkerup, arrived in Latvia today for 
an official working visit. The Danish and Latvian defense 
ministers signed an agreement on cooperation in the military 
field. The agreement provides for mutual consultations on 
issues of defense planning and strategy, as well as security. 
  The agreement also provides for exchange of experience and 
information and visits by officials and officers. Educational 
and practical training programs will be worked out together; 
other issues will be also tackled together. Denmark is the 
first NATO member state with which such an agreement has been 
signed. 
  Pavlovskis [Latvian Defense Minister] values the agreement 
as 
one more step forward in the formation of good relations between 
both states. 
  The Danish defense minister said that Denmark attaches great 
significance to this visit and to cooperation with Latvia. 
  When meeting Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, the Danish 
defense minister expressed unambiguous support for Latvia in the 
issue of the withdrawal of the Russian Army. He expressed hope 
that it would be possible to also agree on the future of the 
Skrunda radar. 
  Haekkerup welcomed the possible participation of the Baltic 
states, including Latvia, in the UN peacekeeping forces. He 
said that this would be a good beginning in cooperation with the 
European security structures. The Danish defense minister 
promised that the issue of the Baltic states' involvement in the 
peacekeeping forces will be discussed at the next meeting of the 
Nordic states' defense ministers. He did not exclude the 
possibility that Denmark and other Nordic states could grant 
material assistance in the formation of the peace battalion of 
the Baltic states.

  [Text] Kazan, 31 Dec -- Tatarstan President Mintimer 
Shaymiyev today addressed New Year's greetings to his fellow 
countrymen. After expressing his best wishes, he said the people 
are coping well with the trials of the early years of transition 
to market conditions. Although farmers have gathered in a fine 
harvest, a difficult situation has taken shape in that sphere, 
as well as in some others, owing to failure to pay. The 
president is confident that all these hardships are temporary 
and will be overcome through joint efforts. A policy which 
regards social programs as a priority is being pursued in the 
republic. 
  Talking about the relations with Russia, Tatarstan's 
president said: "We are continuing consistent work aimed at 
reaching various agreements, taking into account the 
achievements made by Tatarstan on the civilized route toward 
establishing its statehood." Such is the will of the people, 
President Shaymiyev concluded. 
  Wishing his countrymen a happy new year, he told them to 
strengthen links of blood and spirit between one another.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz January 2 TASS -- "I withdraw my 
candidature in the presidential election campaign for the sake 
of further consolidation of society and victory of the North 
Ossetian sound forces," ex-secretary of the Soviet Communist 
Party Central Committee and State Duma deputy from Northern 
Ossetia Aleksandr Dzasokhov told the North Ossetian TV news 
program today. 
  "I am grateful to all North Ossetian electors who supported 
my candidature at the Russian presidential elections. The new 
Russian parliament will have to work hard in the name of 
economic revival of the country and its indivisibility. My 
hopes are pinned on the new Russian constitution approved by the 
people," he said. 
  Speaking of the North Ossetian presidential elections 
scheduled for January 16, Dzasokhov noted the supreme official 
should personify the spirit of accord and well-wishing in the 
multi- national republic. Any social-economic policy can be 
successful only on this basis. 
  "I would wish the future North Ossetian president to be more 
active in solution of personnel issues and combine experience 
and youth. When introducing the presidency in Northern Ossetia, 
we should clearly decide on our foreign and domestic policy, 
development of the social sphere and perfection of inter-ethnic 
relations," added Dzasokhov.

<F P=106> [RIA report: "Moscow Is Far Away but Voters Are Nearby"] </F>
  [Text] Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian 
Government, has sent the North Ossetia Government a number of 
instructions for fulfilling the decisions made 7 December 1993 
in Nalchik at the Russian president's conference with leaders of 
the North Caucasus republics, krays, and oblasts. 
  But at a North Ossetia Security council sesion Akhsarbek 
Galazov, chairman of the republic's Supreme Soviet, stated that 
"a number of instructions which North Ossetia is now being 
obliged to fulfill were not examined at all at the Nalchik 
conference." In the opinion of local observers this divergent 
interpretation of the documents adopted in the capital of 
Kabardino-Balkaria is connected with the forthcoming 16 January 
elections of the North Ossetia president. If the public finds 
out that a representative of North Ossetia has nonetheless 
approved the final document in Nalchik, he will lose support 
among voters..

repeatedly opened fire from automatic weapons and 
grenade-throwers on a customs post near the mountain village of 
Nizhny Lars, located on the Georgian military highway. Two 
agents of the North Ossetian Interior Ministry were wounded by 
grenade splinters. 
  Seven night-time gun battles were fought in several 
settlements of Prigorodny district. No casualities were 
reported. 
  According to information released by the investigation team 
of the Russian Interior Ministry, several submachine-guns, 
fourteen pistols, many grenades and explosive devices, some

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Krivchenko, chairman of the Commission </F>
for Reforming the Local Organs of Power, by Nikolay Belyy in 
Blagoveshchensk under the rubric "Organs of Representative 
Power"; date not given: "Provinces Want To Think"] 
  [Text] Long before the election of the new Russian 
parliament preparation of documents for the reform of the local 
organs of power began in Amur Oblast. Now they are already 
prepared. What will the new organs of power look like away from 
Moscow? A. Krivchenko, chairman of the Commission for Reforming 
the Local Organs of Power, replies to ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. 
  [Belyy] Albert Arkadyevich, here in Amur the people have 
seen and experienced various organs of power provided by God, 
the czar, and the Bolsheviks. Here were military governors 
appointed by the sovereign; subsequently in Blagoveshchensk 
there was a city public administration, a city, that is to say, 
petty bourgeois, administrative office [uprava], a city duma, a 
committee for public safety -- I'm talking about 1917 now -- and 
soviets of various levels. What now? And anyway, was a reform 
of the local power so necessary? After all, on a mundane level 
the old power got in no one's way; it just scribbled one or two 
things here and there, being only a pale shadow of the other, 
pro-party power, as we know. 
  [Krivchenko] It is this power that we are reforming -- a 
window-dressing, a sham power, incapable of thinking properly 
and seeking compromises. A new parliament has been elected in 
the country; what are we supposed to do in the provinces -- 
press on with the soviets, which could offer nothing but the 
imposition of struggle against reforms, the government, and the 
president? Incidentally, long before the elections the activity 
of the soviets at various levels in Amur Oblast was suspended by 
the head of the oblast administration, and only new elections 
can resolve the situation legitimately. Yes, in Amur, as, 
moreover, in Mother Russia as a whole, people have experienced 
various organs of power, and our commission -- which 
incidentally, consists of 17 people, including former deputies 
of various levels, academics, and public figures -- recommends 
the revival of the ancient Russian forms of statehood and 
self-government which the Bolsheviks destroyed by force. Our 
commission has prepared a package of documents aimed at 
reorganizing the representative power and local self-government. 
All experience of power was thorougly studied -- from the epoch 
of military governors in Amur, to our own times; all the best 
was taken from the long history and practice of power. So far 
we have elaborated a provisionary statute on the fundamentals of 
the new power; it will be ratified at the first session of the 
newly elected oblast duma. 
  [Belyy] So you are having a duma anyway. But no such body 
existed in Amur before 1917... 
  [Krivchenko] Yes, that is right, and here we are restoring 
historical justice. We have a governor -- albeit not a military 
one -- but he does not have a system of checks and balances, as 
the local procommunist press writes. Now there will be one, in 
the shape of the oblast soviet. Yes a duma -- how is the 
Russian "dumat" [to think] worse than the bureaucratically 
soviet "soveshchatsya" [to consult]? In line with the 
fundamentals of the Russian constitutional structure, power in 
Amur Oblast is exercised by the organs of representative 
(legislative) power and executive power. The oblast duma is the 
representative structure of state power, the administration the 
executive structure. The duma is elected by the population on 
the basis of universal, direct, equal suffrage by secret ballot 
every two years -- it has 15 deputies. It carries out its 
activity on a permanent and nonpermnaent basis. The procedure 
for the organization and holding of elections to the duma and 
its powers have been elaborated. 
  [Belyy] And what specifically stands behind the concept of 
"local self-government"? 
  [Krivchenko] It will operate within the limits of population 
centers -- cities, microrayons, settlements, villages, stations, 
farmsteads [khutory], and other centers of habitation, and also 
in rayons. We have revived that ancient Russian concept, the 
volost [smallest administrative division of czarist Russia]. It 
is a territorial administrative unit uniting a few population 
centers for which the terms "rural soviet" and "settlement 
soviet" were formerly used. Farmsteads and stations also belong 
to our history. They are names which, if people so desire, can 
be restored not only to old cossack settlements, but to new ones 
as well. 
  In cities under oblast jurisdiction and rayons the organs of 
local self-government are the elective representative organ (the 
city or rayon duma) and the head of local self-government (head 
of administration], appointed by the oblast governor. The 
elective representative organ of local self-government is formed 
by means of the election of between nine and 12 deputies, 
working, as a rule, on a nonpermanent basis. 
  I believe that the following is a very important factor. 
Only citizens of the Russian Federation who have been living on 
the territory of the given electoral district for not less than 
three years can be elected to the oblast duma and to the organs 
of self-government. This will stop the nomination and election 
of "Varangians" [Norse invaders and founders of Kingdom of Rus], 
on whom not so long ago the soviets were wholly built, seeking 
"true people's power" and endlessly flouting the rights and 
dignity of citizens.

  [Text] The armed delegates of the Chechen teyps (clans and 
families) who are arriving in the regional center of Shali, 20 
kilometers from Groznyy, are sent away by the organizers of this 
congress. 
  The congress' headquarters told Interfax that the Chechen 
clans had put off their congress for a second time "to avoid 
bloodshed" after commander of the Shali tank regiment Saifutdin 
Isayev agreed to fulfil the president's order to open fire at 
the delegates and their supporters if the congress took place. 
  Earlier, Isayev had supported the idea of organizing such a 
congress and promised to block the city in order to prevent the 
president's armed supporters from penetrating into it. "We have 
put off the congress because we cannot leave the delegates and 
local population unprotected," said member of the clans' 
Council Mansur Tagirov. "No one expected Isayev to change his 
mind so radically," he added. 
  The Council's headquarters announced that the delegates 
would 
be informed of the date and place of the congress a few hours 
before its opening to prevent the Chechen leaders from sending 
troops to the place before the congress took the decision on 
organizing parliamentary elections next April.

  [Text] Vilnius, 3 Jan -- "This year the basis of 
Lithuania's foreign policy will be partnership with equal rights 
and cooperation with both East and West. Orientation in just 
one direction is not advantageous for our country and will not 
yield the desired results." Lithuanian Head of State Algirdas 
Brazauskas stated this in his customary Monday interview on 
national radio. 
  "In my view, a very important and one of the main priorities 
in Lithuania's foreign policy activity is close cooperation and 
unity with the Baltic states," he noted. 
  "I do not see the sense in and reasons for revising 
relations 
between Lithuania and Russia which, I am convinced, should not 
deteriorate in the coming year. We hope that Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin and the democratic forces which are forming or 
have already formed in the new parliament will correctly 
understand this tendency in the Baltic countries to have a 
benevolent attitude toward the Russian Federation as a neighbor 
country, and will be agreeable to maintaining normal relations," 
the head of the Lithuanian state stressed.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Algirdas Brazauskas by Rytas </F>
Staselis under the "Opinions" rubric; place and date not given: 
"The President Is Calm"] 
  [Text] [Staselis] Mr. President, leaders and 
officials of many states are commenting on the results of the 
Russian elections -- the success of the extremist political 
forces. What is your view? 
  [Brazauskas] I do not see such danger as others do. There 
are also many people panicking in Lithuania. I suppose this is 
unnecessary. Too much talk about a person called Zhirinovskiy 
would do him too much credit. Out of 443 seats in the 
parliament, his party has won only 80. Certainly, there will 
also be communists and their partners, the "agrarians," in the 
Russian Federal Assembly. I am not sure, however, that the 
party membership of most of the elected deputies fully reflects 
their views, because some parties and electoral blocs emerged 
right before the elections. 
  [Staselis] Do you intend to correct Lithuania's policy 
toward Russia somehow? 
  [Brazauskas] I think that our policy toward Russia will not 
change. At least, there is no definite reason for doing this 
now. 
  [Staselis]In your opinion, are the current bilateral 
relations optimal? 
  [Brazauskas] I suppose that we have accomplished 
particularly 
much this year in normalizing Lithuanian-Russian relations. In 
this respect, we have been more successful than our neighbors 
for different reasons. We will also pursue such a balanced 
policy in the future. 
  [Staselis] Mister President, having been disappointed 
with Sajudis, Lithuanian citizens voted for the Lithuanian 
Democratic Labor Party [LDDP] a year ago. In your opinion, for 
whom will they vote during the next elections if they become 
disillusioned with the LDDP, particularly if the economic crisis 
is too protracted? 
  [Brazauskas] No, Lithuania will not have such extremist 
activists like in Russia (if you had in mind such an 
implication) who could expect a victory in the elections. 
  [Staselis] Why? 
  [Brazauskas] Because the community in Lithuania is more 
stable, and the multiparty system is more distinct. Thus, there 
are no conditions for extremist policies. 
  [Staselis] However, can you claim that there is no 
political extremism in Lithuania? 
  [Brazauskas] Well, it is abundant. There are many 
politicians who may not be like Zhirinovskiy, but who are trying 
to accumulate political capital by criticizing the government's 
moves concerning our relations with Russia, by saying: "There 
is no political strategy," "We must apply tough policies toward 
them [Russians]," "Kaliningrad Oblast belongs to Lithuania," "We 
will correct the border between Lithuania and Poland," and so on. 
  [Staselis] Your decision to disband the state 
delegation for negotiations with Russia has caused a certain 
indignation. Did you dissolve this structure for the 
aforementioned reasons? 
  [Brazauskas] Some people are making much noise about this 
issue. The delegation for negotiations is a separate issue. 
First of all, I have not heard of any other country possessing 
such a structure approved by the law: An institution comprised 
of randomly selected persons who are not responsible for 
anything. This delegation claimed that it had great authority, 
but with no responsibility for its actions. 
  [Staselis]What is your reaction to the criticism of the 
former members of this institution directed against you 
concerning the "policy ordered from Moscow," "jellyfish," and so 
on? 
  [Brazauskas] My assessment of this criticism is the same as 
over the past five years. I have been called different names 
all that time, and I have gotten used to it. State interests 
are more important to me than the opinions of some individuals 
about me. 
  [Staselis]However, Lithuanian foreign policy has not 
been ideal. Sometimes it is difficult to understand why there 
is no coordination of action; why one minister does not know 
what his colleague is signing in Moscow; why the foreign 
minister has no documents signed by the prime minister; or why 
the president's office is unaware of the moves of the 
negotiating delegation, to say nothing of certain strange 
situations. What do you think of this? 
  [Brazauskas] Life is life. We will seek strict coordination 
of action among government institutions abroad in the future, 
particularly among those which influence foreign policy. It is 
difficult to achieve this immediately. Certainly, there are 
some people who are used to squeezing their personal opinions or 
principles into some official framework. 
  [Staselis] Can the new seven-member working group for 
negotiations with the CIS, which has replaced the state 
delegation for negotiations with Russia, be interpreted as your 
foreign policy "team"? 
  [Brazauskas] Yes, this is a team that used to meet 
unofficially, and now it has been legalized. 
  [Staselis] Are you not afraid of the accusations that 
you have eliminated all sorts of the opposition from the 
"formation" of foreign policy? 
  [Brazauskas] I have not eliminated anyone. The newly created 
council consists of persons who are responsible for the 
successes and failures in foreign policy. Meanwhile, the 
opposition should engage in creative work in the Seimas 
[parliament] and express its opinion, and we will take it into 
consideration. It is we rather than the opposition who are 
responsible for our state policy today. Therefore, I do not 
think that the opposition should participate in outlining our 
foreign policy. Finishing the issue of the opposition's right 
to state policy, I would add that I also was in the opposition 
once. I remember quite well how much our opinion was necessary 
in drafting state policies or how much it was considered.... 
  [Staselis] Currently, you are under active pressure 
demanding your tough stand on Lithuania's faster accession to 
NATO. What do you think about this? 
  [Brazauskas] I suppose that this issue (knowing its 
difficult 
resolution even in West European countries) is not a matter of 
the non-ruling party alone. I believe that its position on this 
problem considerably exceeds the authority of the government and 
the Seimas. Therefore, a referendum on this issue is quite an 
attractive idea. 
  [Staselis]Mister President, recently Lithuania has 
learned that the world Jewish community is continuing to seek 
that Lithuania be equalled to Germany concerning the Jews' 
genocide during World War II. What is your attitude toward this 
problem? 
  [Brazauskas] I suppose that there has not been such a 
statement, thus, I have no definite reply. I think, however, 
that each similar statement requires evidence. I have 
repeatedly said that some Lithuanian citizens really 
participated in the Jews' genocide -- this is a stigma of our 
nation. I will never agree, however, that the entire nation or 
the state be accused of this. I proposed cooperation in 
definite issues involving concrete names to the Israeli 
delegation during its visit here. However, we will not agree to 
the transfer of all criminal cases to another state. We trust 
Israeli and U.S. justice, and we expect the same from them.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 03, BNS -- President Algirdas 
Brazauskas of Lithuania has been declared the Person of the Year 
in his country, on the basis of a recent opinion poll. 
  He won the highest popularity rating - 31 percent - in the 
poll, taken at the end of December by the Baltic Studies polling 
center at the request of the newspaper LIETUVOS RYTAS, the 
newspaper reported on Friday [31 December]. Second to him is 
Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the right-wing parliamentary 
opposition and former head of state, whose rating is nine per 
cent. 
  According to the same poll, Lithuania's population regards 
the introduction of the permanent monetary unit, the litas, as 
the most important event of 1993 in Lithuania, 26 per cent 
having expressed that view. Twenty-two per cent said the main 
event of the year had been the final withdrawal of Russian 
troops, the rest attaching the greatest importance to the Pope's 
visit or the presidential election. 
  As far as events in the world go, 29 percent attached the 
greatest significance to the October events in Russia, six per 
cent to the war in the former Yugoslavia and four per cent to 
the parliamentary election in Russia.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" Interview with President Algirdas Brazauskas by </F>
Zinoviy Fris; place and date not given: "Chaos -- Not for 
Algirdas Brazauskas"] 
  [Excerpts] [Fris] [passage omitted] Mr.Brazauskas, 
currently, you are the most popular politician in Lithuania. 
Your political rating is very high. Currently, you are first 
in all the polls. Tell me, please, how the former first 
communist secretary of Lithuania has managed to gain this 
authority? What is the "secret" of your political success? 
  [Brazauskas] You know, I have been the first secretary for 
quite a short time.... 
  [Fris] However, your reforms have scared the nonflexible 
communist majority.... 
  [Brazauskas] It is possible. I was a party leader for only 
two years. During the first year, we were looking for ways out 
of the CPSU membership. The second year was devoted to reforms 
within the party. Next, two years of opposition followed. Only 
the 1992 elections demonstrated surprising results. 
  [Fris] [passage omitted] If I understand you correctly, you 
differentiate between economic cooperation and the true 
independence of Lithuania. 
  [Brazauskas] Of course. We are an independent state which is 
recognized by the international community. Our economic 
cooperation is built on mutually beneficial relations. Some 
representatives of our opposition propose to eliminate such 
relations. As for me, I do not worry about our foreign economic 
contacts.... There is no returning to the past. 
  [Fris] What are your relations with Mr. Landsbergis 
[opposition leader]? 
  [Brazauskas] Mr. Landsbergis could have run in the 
elections, 
however, he did not do so for unknown reasons. It seems to me 
that he did not want to take the risk. As for our opposition, 
it is very powerful. It has done a lot for Lithuania and I 
cannot deny this fact. The opposition had, of course, created 
its own political structures when it was in power. Currently, 
four parties out of five represented in the legislature are in 
opposition to us. Nevertheless, we are working. I am trying to 
meet with representatives of various parties and discuss 
political issues with them. Mr. Landsbergis and I meet quite 
often and debate various issues. However, I do not see any 
dangers facing Lithuania, which, in the opinion of Mr. 
Landsbergis, is in itself threatening to our Republic. Our 
organs of power have been elected in a democratic manner. I 
invite all our people to work for the state. Let us resolve 
complicated issues together. 
  [Fris] [passage omitted] Mr. Brazauskas, my interview cannot 
be finished without your comments on Lithuanian-Ukrainian 
relations. They can be called rather weak.... 
  [Brazauskas] To my regret, our relations are weak with many 
countries. The first reason for this includes broken economic 
relations, privatization, new addresses, new leaders.... In 
addition, our governments have changed too often. In a word, 
these reasons are of an objective character. At the same time, 
however, many of our companies have stable economic contacts 
with Ukraine and these relations are deepening. We have several 
intergovernmental agreements, including the agreement on free 
trade. So, we have the necessary agreements but lack specific 
conditions. I know that Ukraine is experiencing an energy 
crisis and a high rate of inflation. You will overcome these 
difficulties. I would like to bring something new to our 
relations. 
  [Fris] Thank you.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 03, BNS - Lithuanian President 
Algirdas Brazauskas addressed his nation one hour before the 
year's end to wish every household good health, teamwork and 
creativity, joy and happiness. 
  He said that the year 1993 had seen numerous significant 
events such as withdrawal of Russian troops, introduction of a 
permanent national currency, state of the law and order reform 
and improved international prestige of the Lithuanian state. 
  The head of state said, however, that numerous problems 
would 
have to be faced in the economy, agriculture, manufacturing 
industries and other areas. 
  The Lithuanian president expressed the hope that they would 
be surmounted if the Seimas [parliament], the government and 
other power and management agencies worked responsibly for 
freedoms and rights, well-being and a better future of 
Lithuania's residents, if the new year saw less suspicion and 
hatred.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius by </F>
RESPUBLIKA under the "Opinions" rubric: "I Am Not So Bad..."] 
  [Excerpts] "All governments are bad, only to a different 
extent," said Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius, occupying the 
chair of RESPUBLIKA's editor for an hour on Friday [17 
December]. The prime minister replied to reporters' questions, 
taught them to be constructive, grieved over his poor 
pedagogical skills, bored everyone to death with his lengthy 
replies, and censored himself. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] With which newspaper do you begin your 
day? 
  [Slezevicius] I regret that V. Baublys, chief of the 
government press service, surveys only exceptional issues. I 
myself have very few opportunities for reading, although I used 
to read all newspapers earlier. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] After the events in the woods near Kaunas 
[reference to volunteer mutiny], you signed a resolution sending 
J. Gecas, chief of staff at the Volunteer National Defense 
Service [SKAT], and commander E. Nazelskis for training to the 
Czech Republic. This is a promotion rather than a 
punishment. 
  [Slezevicius] It is very good that people seek education. I 
do not think that J. Gecas played a great negative role in this 
story. Can all SKAT leaders be doomed to infinite remorse for 
something that occurred in one unit? J. Gecas has resigned his 
position. We will decide separately how to utilize his skills. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] J. Gecas is the current acting deputy 
defense minister, and a few days ago he was appointed chairman 
of the SKAT officers' certification commission.... 
  [Slezevicius] I am not familiar with this situation. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] What is the fate of V. Zedelis, chief of 
the department for the protection of government secrets? 
RESPUBLIKA has already reported about his repeated visits to 
the prosecutor's office in Vilnius concerning the possibilities 
of B. Dekanidze's [suspected of journalist Lingys' murder] 
release. 
  [Slezevicius] His services will be declined. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] You lead not only the government but also 
the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP]. What influence 
may the developing collapse in the LDDP faction have on your 
position in the government? 
  [Slezevicius] What is the basis for your talks about a 
collapse? Only three people out of 70 have left the LDDP 
faction. There have been many complicated discussions over the 
last nine months. My agrarian policy not always meets with 
support from my party colleagues. Sometimes the latter maintain 
that I am too liberal, or that I lack social democracy. My 
reply to all critics inside and outside the party is as follows: 
The formation of a free market alone can ensure economic 
stability, while the latter allows the implementation of social 
democratic ideas through distribution. We are enacting this very 
consistently. Social tensions have eased slightly, because we 
have managed to achieve a real, although insignificant, increase 
in real incomes. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] Do you believe that the law on the 
stability of the litas will be adopted? The draft law alone 
forced the Lithuanian Bank to defend itself. A future 
confrontation between the government and the bank is 
inevitable. 
  [Slezevicius] If I did not believe in the adoption of this 
law, I would not present it. One thing is obvious: Lithuania's 
economy cannot be a hostage of banks, primarily commercial ones. 
Last July and August, the economy received a painful blow due 
to the ruining effect of the unstable litas. Now the Central 
Bank has exhausted all possibilities for ensuring its stable 
exchange rate. The negative effect of our proposal is that the 
government is losing the possibility of replenishing the budget 
or removing its deficit from the Central Bank reserves. 
  Mr. Visokavicius [former central bank chairman] has taught 
the government the art of banking. We realized the negative 
effect of the Central Bank on the economy too late. This is my 
great mistake. It is no accident that R. Visokavicius was the 
most honorable guest at the conservatives' congress.... 
  [RESPUBLIKA] Who left the bugging equipment in his 
office? 
  [Slezevicius] Mr. R. Visokavicius' reaction was strange. His 
statements were as though based on rumor. Maybe, he left the 
equipment there himself.... But this is not for the press. I 
am saying this by taking advantage of the right of the chief 
editor position. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] You have submitted a draft law to the 
Seimas [parliament] which establishes a 35-percent income tax 
alongside a 30-percent social insurance tax. Are you trying to 
cover the hole in the budget with this terrible patch in 
advance? 
  [Slezevicius] This law has been drafted by the social 
democrats, and we do not coordinate our policies with them. We 
are not as bad as the social democrats. We are more socially 
oriented. Taxes should be collected in a better way rather than 
increased now. By the way, taxes and crime are very much linked 
together. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] Why is the LDDP opposing the adoption of 
the law on income declaration so strongly then? 
  [Slezevicius] I am not well informed about the Seimas' 
current debates on this issue. It is difficult to follow 
everything. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] The Seimas proposed the resignation of 
your appointed minister while discussing the agrarian issue. 
Despite your disapproval, the Seimas adopted a law on the 
improvement of the difficult situation in agriculture. If the 
opinions of the government and the Seimas were really different, 
how will things be with agriculture? 
  [Slezevicius] It will survive. The situation was better 
three years ago, but we will not return to it. It is obvious 
that agriculture requires assistance. It is also evident that 
the new laws do not resolve anything. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] Will you not implement this law? 
  [Slezevicius] There is nothing to implement, and the law is 
good because of this, while the government is obedient. 
[passage omitted] 
  [RESPUBLIKA] It seems that the current security policy 
can be called that of "Bobelis-Jurgelis" [chiefs of the Seimas 
Foreign Affairs Committee and the security service]. However, 
no one knows what it is like. Do you have your own idea about 
this issue? 
  [Slezevicius] One thing is clear: We can try to protect 
ourselves, but we are not able to accomplish this. Therefore, 
our national security concept should be our integration with 
European defense structures. During the meeting of the Baltic 
prime ministers, we discussed the necessity of a better defense 
of our eastern borders and the easing of border regime between 
the Baltic countries. 
  [RESPUBLIKA] Don't you think that the national security 
concept should advocate an increased birthrate? 
  [Slezevicius] I am not educated enough to grasp the link 
between the birthrate and national security. I think that the 
birthrate is associated more with our possibilities of supplying 
heat and electric energy. This is what we are doing to expand 
our reproduction.

  [Text] Vilnius, Jan 03, BNS - The Russian oil company 
Lucoil will continue to be the principal partner of the 
Mazeikiai oil refinery this year, said Gediminas Kiesus, 
Mazeikiai assistant director general. 
  Kiesus said the Russian company guarantees stabile oil 
supplies and steady work of the refinery, which is very 
important to Western partners and banks, who might consider 
giving preferential loans to Mazeikiai. 
  According to a contract between Lucoil and the Lithuanian 
refinery, Mazeikiai is supposed to refine 6 million tons of 
Russian oil this year. Lucoil supplied only half of the amount 
it promised for 1993. Kiesus said Mazeikiai will refine 6 
million tons of Russian oil this year if all transportation 
problems are successfully solved. 
  The refinery received 5.1 million tons of oil last year. 
Three million were supplied by Lucoil, 2 million came in from 
different commercial companies and 50,000 were purchased by the 
refinery itself. 
  In 1992, Mazeikiai refined a record low of 4.9 million tons. 
The refinery hopes to get 8 million tons in 1994, which is still 
4 million tons below its maximum annual refining capacity. 
  Kiesus said Mazeikiai intends to buy more oil itself -- some 
50,000-100,000 tons each month. The oil will hopefully be 
purchased for preferential loans from foreign banks and 
financial organizations, he said. Loans for the refinery are 
currently under negotiation between Lithuanian energy officials 
and some Western banks.

<F P=106> [Report by Georgiy Chernomorskiy: "Volodymyr Hrynyov and </F>
Leonid Kuchma Connect Their Hopes With Economic Revival and... 
Elections"] 
  [Text] Volodymyr Hrynyov and Leonid Kuchma, who have 
formed the Interregional Bloc for Reforms, held their first 
press conference last week. All the questions asked by 
journalists basically brought up three issues: The upcoming 
elections, the economic situation of Ukraine, and prospects for 
its relations with Russia following the victory of the 
Zhirinovksiy party in the elections for parliament. Strange as 
it may seem, the journalists first brought up the third issue. 
  No doubt, Leonid Kuchma said, I would prefer to see a party 
supporting Yeltsin get the majority of the votes. There is 
nothing we can do about it. People who voted for the Liberal 
Democratic Party voiced in the first place their discontent with 
economic failures and general impoverishment. At the same time, 
stressed Mr. Kuchma, one should not dramatize the situation -- 
Zhirinovskiys come and go, but Russia will always remain. For 
all pledges of help, no country of the world community provided 
any tangible economic aid to Ukraine. So whether you like it or 
not, the success of our economic reforms is impossible without 
close ties with Moscow. In addition, the strong union of Russia 
and Ukraine would secure the geopolitical peace in the region. 
  Mr. Hrynyov approached this issue from a different 
perspective. The worst thing for me, he said, is not that 
Zhirinovskiy won but that the centrist forces have failed. This 
should become a good lesson for us. We must seek to unite 
democratic forces. 
  Another question was whether the Interregional Bloc would 
cooperate with Rukh in the elections, how close this cooperation 
would be, and if it was possible that both organizations might 
recall their candidates in favor of one another. 
  We are ready to cooperate with all progressive forces, said 
Hrynyov, that put the individual above the rest of the values. 
The individual, society, and the state -- this is the order of 
preference that holds sway in civilized countries. 
Unfortunately, Rukh is currently cooperating with organizations 
that advocate quite the opposite principles. However, I do not 
rule out forming electoral blocs in the hinterland. 
  Mr. Hrynyov noted that he firmly stands for a federative 
division of Ukraine. In his opinion, this presents sizable 
economic advantages for the country. As for regional 
authorities, it is easier for them to decide what enterprises 
should be privatized, put up for auction, sold, or simply shut 
down. 
  Mr. Kuchma was just as specific on this issue. He prefers 
the German option of state division, where with a strong central 
power, local parliaments retain a considerable portion of power, 
which provides them with efficient economic leverages for the 
local economies. In that country, rights go along with 
responsibilities. Although local authorities there funnel 
substantial funds to the federative budget, they actively 
influence industry, agriculture, and trade in their regions. 
Otherwise, they would go bankrupt. In Ukraine, however, some 
of the oblasts live at the cost of their neighbors. 
  Leonid Kuchma and Volodymyr Hrynyov were pretty skeptical 
about government activities, seeing the main thrust of its 
efforts being -- to put it mildly -- misdirected. They also 
think that during a transition period, it is impossible to build 
a strong economy without a strong government. Unfortunately, 
neither the executive branch nor the president's actions can be 
called strong. 
  In a usual straightforward manner, Mr. Kuchma made it clear 
that Ukraine is now facing the question: To be or not to be? 
Unfortunately, we are sharing the same oil bucket with Russia -- 
and if we fail to pay that country for energy sources, we are 
going to kick this bucket. 
  Our correspondent asked why our living standards dropped 
ten-fold at a time when production decreased only by half. 
Leonid Kuchma said that production should not necessarily slump 
proportionately to the drop in living standards. There are some 
enterprises, for example, that could be closed without people 
ever noticing this. However, there are more difficult cases. As 
an example, he cited the Southern Machine-Building Plant 
[Yuzhmash]. While this enterprise manufactured up to 60,000 
tractors per year, its present output is one tractor per day. 
Gas supplies to the enterprise were reduced by 90 percent. We 
used to say restructuring and reform. These are all merely 
words -- in reality, we were basically destroying the economy.

<F P=106> [By unidentified UKRINFORM correspondent for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev, 4 Jan -- In an appeal to the citizens of 
Ukraine, the Interior Ministry of the republic has called for a 
decisive fight against corruption, speculation, bribery, and the 
squandering of national property to be carried out on a broad 
front with the help of the population. 
  Foodstuffs, industrial goods, and essential raw materials, 
the document stresses, are being taken out of the country in 
various ways. The existing transparent borders, the lack of 
respect for laws, and the desire of some enterprises, commercial 
organizations, and individual citizens to get rich in this way 
are to a certain extent helping to make the situation 
significantly more acute. A criminal group that was trying to 
take 30 metric tons of nickel into Poland worth a total of 
$113,000 dollars was recently discovered by employees of 
interior affairs bodies. 
  Over the last two years, more than 40,000 attempts to 
smuggle 
out of Ukraine goods worth 1 trillion karbovantsi have been 
foiled by the military. More than 5,000 metric tons of grain, 
almost 12,000 metric tons of sugar, more than 1,000 metric tons 
of vegetable oil, and 3,000 metric tons of non-ferrous and rare 
earth metals have been returned to the state. 
  In connection with this, the Supreme Council and government 
have recently adopted several legislative acts for stabilizing 
the economic situation in the republic and defending its 
consumer market. The interior affairs bodies are relying on the 
understanding and support of the population for implementing 
these measures. 
  Ukraine's Interior Ministry, the appeal stresses, along with 
the security bodies, border guards, and customs officials will 
do all they can in the future to make sure the border is firmly 
closed and to protect the consumer market in a reliable fashion.

  [Text] Kiev--The Central Electoral Commission registered 
the Liberal Democratic Party of Ukraine [LDPU] on 3 January as 
the 20th party that will nominate candidates during the upcoming 
elections to the Ukrainian parliament. As Volodymyr Klymchuk, 
the party's leader told a UNIAN correspondent, the "LDPU is 
cautious about forming blocs with other political forces. It 
is, above all, afraid of the efforts that have been announced by 
some blocs to form excessively rigid structures that could 
hinder the opportunity to operate independently. However, this 
does not mean that the liberal democrats will halt contacts and 
consultations with other parties." 
  According to Klymchuk, the communists and socialists are the 
only ones considered by the LDPU to be opponents.

  [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent was informed today at 
the Central Electoral Commission for the elections of Ukrainian 
people's deputies that, in accordance with Article 14 of the Law 
on Elections, the Central Electoral Commission has adopted 
resolutions registering the Ukrainian Christian Democratic 
Party, the Democratic Party of Ukraine, the People's Movement of 
Ukraine, the Party of Labor, the Social Democratic Party of 
Ukraine, the Ukrainian Party of Solidarity and Social Justice, 
the Party of Free Peasants of Ukraine, the Peasants' Party of 
Ukraine, the Socialist Party of Ukraine and the Ukrainian 
Conservative Republican Party, in connection with their 
intention to nominate candidates for participation in the 
elections of Ukrainian people's deputies on 27 March 1994. 
Central Electoral Commission Chairman Ivan Yemets handed 
representative of the above political parties the relevant 
registration certificates. 
  A total of 17 political parties have so far been registered 
by the Central Electoral Commission. None of them have 
expressed any desire to form a bloc at national level. 
Commenting on this phenomenon, the Central Electoral 
Commission's secretary, Ihor Tseluyko, explains: "The point is 
that it is disadvantegeous for parties to form a bloc at the 
level of the Central Electoral Commission, since in accordance 
with the law a bloc can only enter one candidate. It is only at 
the regional level that blocs declared at party congresses are 
likely to appear, which will at least enable them to bring 
through a deputy from a friendly camp, if not one of their own."

<F P=106> [Report by Volodimir Chakalin: "Konstyantyn Morozov: `I </F>
Count on Voter Support'"] 
  [Text] For some two months, Konstyantyn Morozov did not 
meet with journalists. For the first time in two years, he took 
a vacation. On 5 December, after finishing his vacation, he 
addressed an appeal to the president and the commander in chief 
of the Ukrainian Armed Forces requesting permission to resign 
from the Armed Forces. 
  Therefore, he appeared before the audience in civilian 
clothes. He was elegant and cheerful. Only his sad eyes showed 
what he had lived through since he was dismissed as Ukraine's 
first defense minister. In my mind, he is living through a 
tragic moment in his life: He was the first to swear allegiance 
to Ukraine and has done a lot to help build our independent 
Armed Forces, and he could do even more if he were to stay. 
However, this is not his personal tragedy but a tragedy of his 
colleagues who believed in him and came with him to the Defense 
Ministry. 
  This meeting with the ex-defense minister was organized by 
the Association of Students "Hurt." This move is the first 
political action of "Hurt." It is symbolic that Konstyantyn 
Morozov met with students first: They were the first to support 
the independence of Ukraine. 
  During his meeting with Kiev students, Konstyantyn Morozov 
told students about his activities as Ukrainian defense minister 
and discussed issues of national security. For more than two 
hours, he answered students' questions. Of course, the first 
question was: Why did you retire? Morozov said: "I always 
answer for all my actions. However, when the government was 
dismissed, I understood quite well that the acting Supreme 
Council will not nominate me to the post of defense minister 
because I opposed our CIS membership. In addition, I had my own 
viewpoint on the problems of the Black Sea Fleet. Hence, my 
resignation. Our president has approved my step." 
  Morozov stated that he was pressed by the Cabinet of 
Ministers and received written threats from special security 
organs. He provided an example of how his attempts to combat 
corruption in the Armed Forces were obstructed. For example, a 
Cabinet of Ministers decree had established a commercial 
structure within a long-range aviation unit. Regular monitoring 
of that unit revealed many financial violations and abuses of 
the law. The defense minister had issued an order halting the 
activities of this commercial structure within the Armed Forces. 
However, the new defense minister started his activities by 
repealing Morozov's order. 
  The public asked Konstyantyn Morozov about the fighting 
condition of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the nuclear arms 
issues, and prospects for restructuring Ukraine's Armed Forces. 
The ex-minister confirmed to the audience that the Republic's 
nuclear warheads are in a state of combat readiness. Answering 
a question on if a civilian should be named defense minister, he 
said: "In my opinion, sooner or later Ukraine will have a 
civilian defense minister." 
  Speaking about his plans, Morozov explained that he has 
received a lot of proposals from various political parties and 
movements to run in the upcoming Supreme Council elections. The 
ex-minister has not yet made a final decision to represent a 
specific political movement, but he is going to run in Kiev.

<F P=106> ["Appeal by the Crimean Civic Congress to Ukraine's Supreme </F>
Council and President Regarding Crimean Presidential Elections"] 
  [Text] As is known to you, despite the current 
legislation, Ukrainian Constitution, and public protests, the 
Crimean Supreme Council has introduced the institution of 
presidency and appointed the Crimean presidential elections for 
16 January 1994. 
  The course of the election campaign has revealed an 
unconcealed antistate, anti-Ukrainian, and chauvinist 
orientation of programs adhered to by many presidential 
candidates. The mass media are full of malice against Ukraine 
and call for restoring the USSR and going under Russia's flag. 
  The Crimean Ukrainian public and political organizations 
came 
out decisively against the introduction of the institution of 
presidency in the Crimea, since this may lead to the obstruction 
of the central presidential power, strengthening of separatism 
and confrontation, and is, possibly, the last attempt to sever 
the Crimea from Ukraine, something which threatens its 
territorial integrity, peace, and quiet. 
  In addition, during this time of crisis, the holding of 
Crimean presidential elections will be an additional material 
burden upon the electorate and will later lead to an expansion 
of the bureaucratic apparatus, which is too inflated even now. 
  The Crimean Ukrainian Civic Congress, whose constituent 
congress was held on 28 November 1993, has employed the tactics 
of active political and legal counteraction to the illegal 
Crimean presidential elections and has, for this purpose, 
enlisted the services of state and public structures. 
  However, we are extremely surprised and alarmed by your 
inert 
and reticent position regarding the events in the Crimea. Nor 
do the Crimean Tatar people, who have been constantly supporting 
Ukraine's state-building policy, but have encountered an 
indifferent attitude toward their problems, understand the 
silence of official Kiev. 
  The actions by Ivan Yermakov, Ukrainian presidential 
representative in Sevastopol, are disloyal with regard to the 
Ukrainian state. He has recently taken a direct part in 
procommunist and chauvinist gatherings and expressed support for 
anti-Ukrainian circles. 
  The fact that he decided to nominate himself as a Crimean 
presidential candidate shows his contempt for the Ukrainian 
legislature, the fulfillment of which he was supposed to 
guarantee. Ivan Yermakov's 11 December 1993 appeal, full of 
groundless and contemptuous criticism of Ukrainian leadership, 
marks his transition to an open opposition to the Ukrainian 
president, Supreme Council, and government. At a conference of 
leaders of Sevastopol enterprises and organizations on 13 
December 1993, he stated that he considered the institution of 
Ukrainian presidential representatives inexpedient. Does such a 
representative of the Ukrainian president have the right to 
occupy this position? 
  The Ukrainian Civic Congress demands that Ukraine's Supreme 
Council and president do the following: 
  1. Consider the question of the systematic violation of the 
Ukrainian Constitution and current legislation in the Crimea. 
  2. Condemn the attempt by the Communist Party nomenklatura 
to introduce the institution of presidency and to cancel the 
Crimean presidential elections as being at variance with 
Ukraine's current legislation. 
  3. To implement Ukraine's law "On the Ukrainian Presidential 
Representation in the Crimea." 
  4. To remove Ivan Yermakov from his post as Ukrainian 
presidential representative in the Crimea. 
  5. In carrying out the Ukrainian state-building policy in 
the Crimea, to rely upon patriotic political and public 
organizations.

<F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Shkhovchek: "Hopes for Cooperation </F>
Will Die Last"] 
  [Text] The time when national democrats will unite their 
efforts in the parliamentary or presidential election campaigns 
will be an event comparable in significance to the first manned 
space flight. Despite the fact that statements about the 
"permanent cooperation of democratic forces in the face of a 
communist threat" are predominant in the majority of national 
democrats' speeches, optimistic voices are increasingly fading. 
All the democrats declare their commitment to the idea of a 
single bloc, yet every one of them acknowledges that such a bloc 
is far from likely. 
  "The issue of forming blocs," says Ukrainian Republican 
Party 
Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn, "is a very subtle one. Talks on it are 
in progress. I guess that there will be several meetings, at 
which we will try to come together. The main reservations with 
regard to the formation of such a bloc are from the 
left-centrist forces: the Labor Congress and the Party of 
Democratic Revival of Ukraine [PDRU]. However, I think that the 
last word has not been said, and we are still hoping to achieve 
some type of accord. Especially as PDRU leaders are continuing 
their consultations with us; I hope we will reach an agreement. 
If this, to our regret, does not happen, then we will have 
several blocs: left-centrist, right-centrist, centrist, and, as 
usual, a socialist and communist bloc. If the extreme rightists 
will form a bloc, I cannot say, but they are also preparing for 
the elections." 
  The behavior of democratic forces during the parliamentary 
elections is a point of great importance, because the electoral 
campaign will reveal the actual state of matters in the camp of 
Ukrainian democrats and become a "dress rehearsal" of the fight 
for the highest state post. 
  Several months ago it seemed that an accord, at least among 
certain national and democratic groupings, would be achieved. 
Testifying to this belief was the joint declaration of 18 
political parties and trade unions to create an electoral bloc. 
However, several weeks passed, and some centrifugal trends have 
become evident within the newly created democratic coalition. 
  At first, the leaders of free trade unions stated that their 
representatives had not participated in the conference and, 
therefore, they are not obliged to fulfill the conference's 
resolutions. Soon afterward, democratic trade unions created a 
new organization -- the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine -- which 
is going to participate in the elections on an independent 
basis. "I can say," says Serhiy Klimov, deputy head of the 
Independent Trade Union of Miners of Ukraine and head of the 
trade union at the production amalgamation Donetskivuhilla, who 
can influence the distribution of 30 deputy seats, "that our 
trade union, according to the resolution of member 
organizations, will directly participate in elections. It has 
been resolved, for the time being, to not attach ourselves to 
some bloc or political party. We will support independent 
candidates or put forth our own representatives. I am convinced 
that 90 percent of those supported by us will win deputy seats. 
In the future parliament, our lobby will influence the course 
of legislative change in a direction more preferable to trade 
unions." 
  This separate position astonished leaders of those 
organizations which formerly tried to cooperate with trade 
unions. The creation of the temporary Rukh and trade unions 
staff on the eve of the adoption of a new electoral law boded 
well for the permanence of such cooperation. "I do not 
understand why trade union leaders have not decided to form a 
single coalition bloc with us," says deputy head of Rukh 
Oleksandr Lavrynovich. "Everywhere in the world, politics is 
handled by parties, while trade unions are concerned with the 
social protection of their members." It is no secret that Rukh 
leaders cherished great hopes for the bloc with trade unions; 
they expected to drive with trade unions some portion of the 
Rukh candidates in eastern and central regions. However, the 
Supreme Council has adopted a majority-type electoral law 
entitling trade unions to field their own candidates on a par 
with parties. It is clear that this circumstance has turned 
them off from further cooperation with Rukh. 
  Still it seems that Rukh has not lost hope for an agreement 
with trade unions. The draft electoral program, which was 
submitted for approval by the Rukh Congress on 10-12 December, 
devoted an entire chapter to trade union issues. "Trade 
unions," reads the text, which was clearly intended to catch the 
fancy of trade unionists, "should become the main guarantors of 
obeying the law on hired labor, independently of the branch of 
production or form of property." 
  Thus, while analyzing the formation of preelection blocs, 
one 
discerns without difficulty the lack of unity among the 
democratic parties. At the same time, their political opponents 
prefer more practical actions. The symptoms of that can be 
traced in the selection of central and district electoral 
commission members, as well as in the distribution of electoral 
districts between the members of the Kravchuk-Plyushch team, 
which is intended to remove unnatural competition between 
representatives of this team. For instance, with the exception 
of Ivan Plyushch, no one from the nomenklatura, which is 
generally pacified both by its nonparty alignment and "scuffles" 
between democrats and communists, is going to run in the 
elections in Barishevski rayon of Kiev Oblast.

<F P=106> [Report by Oleksiy Mustafin: "Unity of National Democrats </F>
May Result in Their Joint Defeat"] 
  [Text] Delegates and guests of the Fifth Rukh Congress had 
a wonderful occasion to see an "unofficial" show. Following the 
invitation of Vyacheslav Chornovil, political leaders who had 
signed an agreement on forming the Council of Democratic Parties 
and Organizations took the rostrum and ceremonially swore to put 
an end to discord and join efforts for the victory of democracy. 
That was a touchy scene, even though the Party of Democratic 
Renaissance of Ukraine had reneged on its commitments to join 
the council. 
  It is too early to announce the premature death of the 
Council of Democratic Parties and Organizations, but there is no 
doubt that the "child" is afflicted with a serious congenital 
disease. The fathers of the council were too inharmonious and 
there was too broad an incongruity between their slogans and 
practical goals. 
  The council was formed at the initiative of leaders of the 
Ukrainian Republican Party [URP] and the Democratic Party. 
These parties have always demonstrated their loyalty to the 
president and given preference to access to power rather than 
the ephemeral unity of democratic forces. The URP has always 
opposed all kinds of blocs and coalitions, and agreed to join 
the latter only if was granted a leading position. Such 
coalitions inevitably became URP delegations and "independent 
players" quickly lost interest in their activities. 
  It is understood that Republicans' unexpected desire to 
unite 
was prompted by purely practical considerations. Republican 
stakes in the upcoming elections are not very high and slogans 
like "Unity above all!" may increase chances for victory at the 
expense of possible partners. The URP remains loyal to its 
former strategy and will try to gain control over the future 
coalition. 
  Republicans need the council, both to gain additional weight 
and neutralize its rivals. On the one hand, the URP cannot 
compete with representatives of the "party of power"; on the 
other hand, Republicans are trying to avoid competition with the 
Rukh and other national-democratic forces. The "peaceful" 
division of electoral districts between URP and the Rukh can be 
achieved through the newly formed council. The URP dreams of a 
situation in which its candidates could be nominated only in the 
districts in which there are neither Rukh nor "party of power" 
representatives, even more so if this could be done under the 
camouflage of consolidating the democratic movement. 
  Having realized that the goals of the council are different 
from its declarations, the more moderate organizations began to 
back out. The example of the Party of Democratic Renaissance was 
followed by the "Greens." The Rukh found itself in a ticklish 
situation. Its leaders realized that they had been involved in 
somebody's schemes, having no control over the situation. It 
was not by coincidence that the URP-oriented Union of Ukrainian 
Students was invited to join the council, why the 
Rukh-affiliated Ukrainian Students' Association was not. 
Neither was the newly formed Youth Rukh Organization. However, 
the Rukh cannot abandon the council because in this case its 
leaders could be blamed for splitting the "national democratic 
forces." 
  Those claiming that the Rukh made a strategic mistake in 
1992, are probably right. At that time, following a declaration 
on opposition to the official power, the organization should 
have emphasized socioeconomic reform rather than national and 
cultural ideas. As a result of this mistake, forces 
representing similar ideas (the Party of Democratic Renaissance, 
the "Greens," and social-democrats) have not been included in 
the coalition, while those who threatened to destroy "the 
Chornovil movement" became its members. 
  Cooperation between the Rukh and the Congress of Ukrainian 
Nationalists [KUN] is the only possible counterbalance to URP 
domination of the council. Both parties have similar political 
programs and oppose the current administration, considered by 
them the successor of the Soviet nomenklatura. Finally, both 
the Rukh and the Congress have a very "cautious" attitude toward 
the Republican and Democratic Parties. 
  However, there exists a certain difference in views between 
the KUN leadership and the rank and file, limiting the chances 
for cooperation with the Rukh. The leadership of the Congress 
is closer to the Rukh than its provincial organizations. Very 
often, especially in West Ukraine, Rukh and KUN advocates find 
themselves in two opposing camps. 
  As a rule, candidates for deputies will be nominated not in 
accordance with their professional qualities, but in accordance 
with their party membership. Reliable sources have reported 
that in Poltava, for instance, URP will nominate its candidates 
in every district in which a Rukh candidate is registered. A 
similar situation may develop throughout eastern and central 
Ukraine, reducing the chances of all democratic candidates.

  [Text] A special resolution adopted by the Lvov Oblast 
Council has deemed as subversive the activities of the 
reconstituted and illegally registered Communist Party of 
Ukraine. The resolution imposes a ban on issuing permits for 
staging mass communist rallies, as well as granting communist 
organizations facilities and telephone lines for their 
activities. Communist publications must not be circulated. 
Communists must not act as official co-organizers of any 
undertakings. 
  Thus, communists are being ruled with a rod of iron. 
Although there is no information regarding any punishments for 
violating the ban, from now on communists can hardly be expected 
to hold open party meetings. They have no choice but to 
continue their activities underground. Had it not been for the 
Oblast Council attack of rage, communists could have been kept 
under the authorities' watchful eye.

  [Text] The Fourth Emergency Congress of the Ukrainian 
Civil Congress was held in Kharkov and attended by deputies 
representing 17 regions. Having discussed the organization's 
election platform, participants in the congress came to the 
conclusion that regional organizations should independently 
determine the strategy of their electoral campaign, in light of 
local conditions and following guidelines drafted by the forum. 
  The Civil Congress is a leftist-centrist organization ready 
to cooperate with political forces fighting against nationalist 
extremism and advocating Ukraine's equal membership in an 
economic union with other former republics of the USSR. The 
delegates adopted a political declaration urging the formation 
of a close economic, diplomatic, military, and humanitarian 
union on the basis of the CIS; a resolution on the religious 
situation in Ukraine, and a statement regarding celebrations of 
the 340th anniversary of Ukraine's unification with Russia on 8 
January 1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Vasyl Lukyanchuk: "1993 -- the Year of Ukraine's </F>
Defeat"] 
  [Text] This was the conclusion of the Fourth Congress of 
the national union Ukraine's State Independence [DSU]. The year 
1993 has become a year of defeats of the Ukrainian people: As a 
result of the collaboration of the democratic-communist elite 
with Moscow, Washington, and Tel Aviv, certain agreements have 
been signed, which endanger Ukraine's sovereignty, its 
territorial integrity, and its Armed Forces. During this year, 
Ukraine has not even approached its long-dreamed independence. 
  Thanks to the communists and the democrats, who are Russian 
and American fifth columns, as well as due to their 
protectionist policy toward the Russian and Jewish ethnic 
minorities, the situation of the Ukrainians on their own soil 
has become unbearable. 
  Nowadays, the Ukrainians are kept even farther away from the 
levers of power than on the eve of the proclamation of 
independence; the birthrate has dramatically dropped, mortality 
among the Ukrainians has increased, and life expectancy has 
considerably decreased. 
  Russification is rampant: Stores are jammed with Russian 
Stalinist literature and OSTANKINO has spread its expansionist 
propaganda to the Ukraine. At the same time, Ukrainian 
publications and books are disappearing. 
  The Russian language dominates on the streets, in courts, in 
the Army, and at the Supreme Council. Separatist movements are 
flexing their muscles. 
  The socioeconomic situation of the Ukrainians has 
deteriorated, living conditions have declined, and foreign 
capital has become deep-rooted on our territories. 
  Ukraine has become a territory, on which counterespionage 
services of hostile states operate freely: First of all, these 
include the Russia's KGB and Counterintelligence Service, 
America's CIA, and the Jewish Mosad. Agents from these 
countries have become leaders of a majority of Ukrainian 
parties, movements, banks, and funds. There are plenty of them 
in the Supreme Council, the president's offices, the Security 
Service of Ukraine, and the General Staff of the Navy. 
Simultaneously, patriotic officers are being released from duty 
in the Armed Forces. 
  Due to the defeatist policy of [Ukrainian President] Leonid 
Kravchuk, Ukraine has lost the Black Sea Fleet and its tactical 
nuclear weapons. In accordance with agreements signed by the 
president, tanks, airplanes, armored carriers, and the equipment 
of the Antiaircraft Defense are being dismantled. Russian 
troops still remain on Ukrainian land. Parties comprising 
advocates of Ukraine's statehood are persecuted by the 
democratic-communist structures: Telephones belonging to 
activists of the national movement are being bugged and their 
correspondence monitored; activities of Ukrainian economic 
structures are hampered; statements by DSU, the Organization of 
Ukrainian Nationalists, the Ukrainian Conservative Republican 
Party [UKRP], and the Union of Ukrainian Youth are sporadically 
presented by the media. Television is available only for 
Kravchuk's servants, the Russian and Jewish ethnic minorities, 
and adherents of Western "values." The official press is 
conducting a smear campaign against Ukrainian patriots, which is 
called the fight against Ukrainian fascism. The anti-Ukrainian 
authorities are trying to ban opposition newspapers, 
particularly NESKORENA NATSIYA, as well as to arrest their 
editors and other leading Ukrainian journalists. 
  The political trials of members of DSU, UKRP, the Ukrainian 
National Assembly, the Ukrainian National Self Defense, and the 
Volyn Sich Cossacks are being continued. Ukrainian patriots 
still remain in prisons. 
  Today, only Ukrainian nationalism with its program 
principles 
-- "Ukrainian state above all!" and "Ukraine for Ukrainians!" -- 
is able to avert a national catastrophe. 
  The main task of DSU is to unite all the patriotic forces of 
Ukraine around the nationalistic idea, as well as to shake off 
our necks the shameful foreign yoke. It is necessary to 
introduce a national dictatorship for a transitional period of 
national liberation and for establishing a national 
infrastructure. 
  National dictatorship is an urgent necessity of the 
transitional period. Only national dictatorship is capable of 
fulfilling the historic task of reviving Ukrainian statehood, as 
well as of establishing a just nationalistic order and a 
permanent political system in Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Statement by the All-Ukrainian Political Association </F>
"Ukrainian State Independence" (DSU): "The Political Philosophy 
of the DSU"] 
  [Text] The ideology of the DSU is not restricted to the 
interests of a social or party group, stratum, or class, but 
expresses the interests of the nation. The political ideology 
of the DSU is natiocratic [natsiokratychna]. The association 
strives to build a natiocratic state in which the UKRAINIAN 
NATION will be the source of power. 
  Nation is the main concept in the DSU's political 
philosophy. 
The rights and interests of the nation are the main criteria of 
our actions. The government is legitimate when it is guided by 
the interests of the Ukrainian nation. 
  The task of the state is to serve the nation and to be a 
powerful instrument in its political and spiritual 
self-assertion and in its historic activity. The power of the 
Ukrainian nation will also guarantee the rights of every member 
of this great entity. 
  When we say "nation" we mean an "ethnos," which controls 
itself and ethnic minorities. For us, the notions "nation" and 
"state" are inseparable. 
  The WILL, POWER, and GRANDEUR of the NATION is the triad of 
our political philosophy. The national will primarily expresses 
internal aspirations of the ethnos, which has acquired its 
statehood. The category "power of the nation" has both internal 
and external political dimensions. Control over itself is not 
the ultimate goal of a nation. A nation strives to expand its 
influence and its power imperatives beyond its own territory. A 
full-fledged national idea cannot remain confined to the 
boundaries of its own state and it expands beyond internal 
national problems. It is characterized by messianic 
aspirations. A nation strives to make its own values and its 
own understanding of the world a legacy of other nations in 
order to sow its seed on the soil of other states. 
  Every developed nation strives to create a civilization and 
include other nations into the sphere of its influence and into 
its sociocultural sphere. 
  A great nation is a nation that has achieved success in all 
spheres of self-expression, played all the roles meant for it by 
BIRTH [Rid], and is capable of teaching the world and 
influencing the course of history. Such a nation is ideal and 
such a nation is majestic [mayestatychna]! 
  We do not conceal our desire to witness Ukraine's world 
grandeur. Yes, we want Ukraine to become a political, economic, 
and cultural superpower. 
  Political power is created by military force. In order to 
become a weighty political factor in history and in order to 
renounce the pernicious principle of neutrality, Ukraine must 
become a military and powerful state. 
  A country that does not want to be pushed to the background 
and that strives to influence historical processes, must be a 
nuclear power. That is why, despite the unprecedented pressure 
exerted upon us by the United States and Russia, Ukraine must 
keep its nuclear weapons. 
  The 21st century will become an epoch of natiocratic 
revolutions. The Western civilization, which is based upon 
liberal democratic (but, in fact, transformed Judaic) values, 
has exhausted its creative potential. The Russian civilization 
is also moving toward a catastrophe. The natiocratic ideas of 
Mykola Mikhnovskyy, Dmytro Dontsov, Mykola Stsiborskyy, and 
Stepan Bandera are victoriously spreading. The sun of the 21st 
century that rises over Ukraine will herald the advent of a 
total natiocratic renaissance to the world.

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel O. Slyusarev: "The Members of Ukraine's </F>
Officers' Union Have Something To Think About"] 
  [Text] What has the Officers' Trade Union 
Organization achieved over the period of its existence? 
  1. Transferred approximately 1,000 officers serving outside 
Ukraine, those whom Ukraine's Ministry of Defense did not want 
to accept (General Ihnatenko) into Ukraine's Armed Forces. 
  2. Forced K. Morozov's Defense Ministry to provide us with 
12 
Il-76 aircraft for transferring 500 officers, members of their 
families, and household effects from Azerbaijan to Ukraine, as 
well as automobiles for transporting their belongings from 
airports to their residences in Ukraine. 
  3. Forced the government of the defense minister of 
Azerbaijan to pay increased monetary compensation for the living 
quarters rented in Azerbaijan by members of the organization at 
the rate of 5,000 Russian rubles [R] per one square meter of 
total area and not R3,000 per one square meters of useful area. 
In comparison with other servicemen, members of the 
organization obtained an additional R250,000-300,000 in 
September 1992 prices. 
  4. By the organization's actions and with the help of the 
Supreme Council, forced K. Morozov's Defense Ministry to cancel 
Order No. 194 on introducing the notorious contract system for 
the continuation of service in Ukraine's Armed Forces. 
  5. In March 1993, won the court case against the Darnytsya 
housing office as a result of which an apartment in Kiev became 
the property of Captain Yermakov and his family. The court took 
the side of the trade union, even though, in accordance with the 
law, Yermakov had not been entitled to that apartment because 
neither he nor the members of his family were registered in that 
apartment. It was the serviceman's father who had lived there 
before he died. The organization maintained the empty apartment 
for five months until Yermakov was transferred from the 
Transbaykal region to Ukraine's Armed Forces. 
  6. In August 1993, won the court case against Major General 
Gvozdev, chief of the Air Defense Academy, who demanded the 
eviction of the family of Lieutenant Colonel Avramenko, a 
graduate of the academy, from the official apartment and for 
that reason ordered not to issue a payment book to him. 
Avramenko and his family continue to live in the same apartment 
and the payment book is in his pocket. 
  7. In October 1993, forced the Council of People's Deputies 
of Bila Tserkva to put an end to the procrastination and 
allocate plots of land for building to the housing construction 
society "Hayok" -- our cell in Bila Tserkva. The chairman of 
the local council, Shulypa, resolved this question positively. 
  8. Protected member of the organization Major of the Guard 
Lalak from being dismissed into the reserve before reaching the 
length of service entitling him to benefits, despite the fact 
that two assessment commissions in the regiment and the division 
unanimously decided that it was "expedient to dismiss him into 
the reserve." The organization conducted explanatory work with 
the command, and the latter adopted the only correct decision -- 
to allow him to continue his service. 
  9. Forced head of the Zaliznychnyy District Military 
Committee to renounce its illegal action -- an attempt to 
dismiss member of the organization Major Melnykov into the 
reserve without providing him with housing. An additional 
session on legal training sufficed. 
  10. Instituted court proceedings against Defense Minister 
Colonel General K. Morozov in order to protect the honor and 
dignity of the Trade Union of Ukrainian Servicemen and its right 
to existence. However, after Morozov was dismissed from his 
post, the Independent Trade Union of Ukrainian Servicemen 
dropped the case. 
  All of the above is quite sufficient to prove that the 
Independent Trade Union of Ukrainian Servicemen, which unites 
within its ranks the most conscious, best organized, and honored 
Ukrainian officers, is the only organization of servicemen 
capable of protecting its members and contributing to the honor, 
dignity, and significance of officers, as well as making our 
army one of the most advanced armies in the world. 
  What can the Ukrainian Officers' Union say to this to 
justify 
itself?

  [Text] Well informed sources in the Russian Foreign 
Ministry told Interfax that Russian President Boris Yeltsin had 
sent an invitation to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to 
come to Moscow to participate in his meeting with U.S. president 
Bill Clinton. 
  The Russian-American summit is known to be scheduled for 
January 12-15. 
  "Now it is difficult to say whether the Moscow summit will 
become a tripartite one," a top-ranking official said during his 
conversation with Interfax. He explained that much would depend 
upon Kravchuk's position. "The reason for his presence in Moscow 
is to reconfirm all commitments taken by Ukraine without any 
exception," he underlined. 
  As the diplomat said, it means that Ukraine must confirm its 
adherence to the START-1 Treaty and guarantee its joining the 
NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] as a non-nuclear state. "Any 
reservations or provisions set forth by the Ukrainian parliament 
during the ratification of the START-1 treaty cannot be 
recognized as acceptable. Neither Russia, nor the United States 
would agree to this," said the diplomat. 
  He reiterated that President Kravchuk himself declared his 
intention to submit the START-1 Treaty to the country's new 
Supreme Soviet, to be elected March 27, for another 
ratification. "Nevertheless, there are many unclear aspects in 
Kiev's position. That is why one cannot say for sure that 
Kravchuk's visit to Moscow will take place," he indicated.

<F P=106> [Ivan Rodin report in the "Parliament" column: "Talks about </F>
the Speaker End Around the Kremlin Christmas Tree. LDPR Leader 
Is Russia's Choice's Sole Hope for a Breakup of the `Big 
Coalition'"] 
  [Text] Today another round of talks is due to be held 
between the four potentially largest factions in the State Duma 
about the candidacy of its future chairman. The previous round, 
which took place on the morning of 31 December, ended 
inconclusively. Russia's Choice, as has always been the case 
recently, has again found itself in isolation but this time its 
partners-opponents (the Agrarian Party of Russia, the Russian 
Federation Communist Party, and the Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia [LDPR]) were not quite so unanimous either. According to 
some sources, some turmoil among their hitherto apparently 
uniform ranks was introduced by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who has 
just returned from his foreign tour which concluded so 
unexpectedly. He replaced Viktor Kobelev, chief of his own 
party apparatus, at the negotiating table, and therefore some of 
the details agreed upon earlier had to be repeated to him. 
  According to Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the Agrarian Party, 
today's meeting will apparently be decisive. If there are no 
results -- that is to say, if there is no consensus on the 
nomination of a mutually satisfactory candidacy for the Duma 
speaker -- then votes would have to be counted. It can be 
stated with certainty that this is precisely what the leadership 
of each of the four large factions will have to do. With 
respect to Russia's Choice this procedure will apparently be the 
most upsetting, since its own votes will obviously not be enough 
to outweigh the votes of the agrarians, the communists, and the 
Zhirinovskiy followers. Incidentally, according to some reports, 
Russia's Choice was prepared for a failure at the talks on the 
speaker back when they were just beginning, while their results, 
by general consent, were reported to the press in upbeat, i.e., 
quite ambiguous phrases. It was at that moment that a member of 
the Russia's Choice faction who enjoyed substantial influence 
within it told NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent that their 
candidate would be Sergey Kovalev, provided the speaker is 
selected from among the major factions. If the Duma chairman is 
sought within a number of small factions, Russia's Choice would 
support any constructive candidacy. 
  Now it is appropriate to go back to Russia's Choice's 
problems over the counting of its own votes. They (these 
problems) will become especially serious after the "democratic" 
factions possibly refuse to team up with Russia's Choice on the 
speaker issue. This mainly concerns the Party of Russian Unity 
and Accord [PRES], whose leader Sergey Shakhray reminded 
Russia's Choice about the pledges by its numerous 
representatives that they would never sit down next to the 
fascists. True, the refusal to form a bloc with Russia's Choice 
will not bring PRES any success and, having no chances to get 
through its own candidate as chairman, it will have to vote 
against everyone, which somewhat contradicts its basic 
principles: unity and accord. Russia's Choice itself will 
undoubtedly explain away its participation in the talks by 
pragmatic considerations, at the same time renouncing its 
earlier pledges, citing pre-election rhetoric and the bitterness 
of defeat, widely publicized by pro-presidential TV. Therefore 
a bloc of smaller factions and a group of "independents" with 
Russia's Choice is evolving objectively: Only then will they 
possibly have a majority. It is another question whether such a 
number of partners, where each partner has his own interests and 
is determined to satisfy them to the fullest possible extent, 
will be able to come to a definite agreement. If not, defectors 
are bound to appear again: first, single individuals and then 
whole factions which will tip the scale. It appears that 
Russia's Choice has only one hope: Mr. Zhirinovskiy's 
unpredictable behavior.

  [Text] Petrozavodsk, 31 Dec -- Karelian residents have been 
given a New Year present -- President Boris Yeltsin has signed 
an edict "concerning the classification of individual 
territories of the republic as belonging to rayons of the 
extreme north and areas enjoying the same status." The 
residents of the north have been waiting a long time for this 
decision and regard it as equitable compensation for the 
discomfort they experience living in inclement climatic 
conditions. 
  Now, in keeping with the edict, the residents of Karelia 
have 
been given the right to draw their pensions five years earlier 
than before. Apart from this, the northern allowances, payable 
over and above the local wages, have been considerably increased. 
  However, residents in some Karelian villages are still 
dissatisfied with what they see as this kind of levelling-down. 
In keeping with the presidential edict, the republic has been 
divided into two zones with slightly differing benefits. It 
transpires that Kostomuksha, in the north of this lakeland area, 
is on a par with the southern Sortavala, where the climate is 
much milder. 
  In their appeal to the Karelian Supreme Soviet deputies, 
Kostomuksha inhabitants demand that this inequality in benefits 
be removed.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Skachko report: "Authorities Speak About </F>
Elections, Opposition Speaks About Reforms. But Both Count on 
Electors' Votes"] 
  [Text] Filling Ukrainian television airwaves and 
newspapers, President Leonid Kravchuk, Parliament Speaker Ivan 
Plyushch, and his first deputy Vasyl Durdinets spoke about one 
thing -- the need for holding elections for a new Supreme 
Council of Ukraine. More explicit was Leonid Kravchuk, who 
stated that "agitation against the elections is agitation 
against the state." Statements of this sort are quite 
explainable for two main reasons. First, today's state leaders 
have realized the need for a new additional legitimation of the 
old political system of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic 
led by party nomenklatura in a new political guise. This 
legitimacy can be lent to the present "party of power" only by 
new elections in accordance with a formally new election law. 
Second, the mentioned law gives the party of power political 
and legislative advantages at the time of elections owing to 
which each branch of this "party" -- pro-president and 
pro-Soviet -- wants to win the elections, eliminate its rivals, 
and establish its own vision of development of the state. 
  Leaders of the opposition came up with a totally different 
assessment of the past year and the new one. Vyacheslav 
Chornovil, chairman of the People's Rukh of Ukraine, stated that 
"despite all the actions of leaders of the state it has not yet 
collapsed. Despite the anti-people majority in the 
pseudo-parliament, despite the senseless decisions by the Kuchma 
government, to say nothing about the despicable 
Kravchuk-Zvyagilski government, we are still holding out." In 
the opinion of Vyacheslav Chornovil, today too, a majority of 
Ukraine's population would vote for independence but not the 
sort of independence offered to them by the present leaders of 
the country. Vyacheslav Chornovil also said he did not see the 
next year as being happy. The Rukh leader once again said that 
the election campaign was difficult because, he stated, the 
"`party of power' is straining every muscle not to let reformers 
come to power once again." According to Vyacheslav Chornovil, 
Ukraine's new parliament will hardly be worse than the present 
one, and quite probably it is this parliament that will raise 
the question of forming a government of reforms. Vyacheslav 
Chornovil assessed the chances of creating such a government as 
being 50 to 50 percent. "Even if the government jump-starts 
reforms, in the new year we will already be able to sense some 
of their results like, for example, a sharp decline in the rate 
of inflation. Even if there are resolute reforms, stabilization 
of the living standard and progressive changes in the economy 
are possible only by the end of the year," the Rukh leader 
summed up. 
  Ivan Zayets, chairman of the parliament opposition, has 
stated that through the fault of the "party of power" last year 
was a "year of deceleration" when the main mistake of an 
independent Ukraine revealed itself -- no political reform of 
power had been carried out -- which, according to I. Zayets, 
halted the processes of the state's organizational development. 
"We should implement the second stage of the 
national-democratic revolution -- to follow up the declaration 
of independence with decommunization and decolonization. The 
year 1994 will be crucial. I think we will after all be able to 
hold the elections, to pass a new constitution and progressive 
laws. Democracy should win out at the elections, and this will 
pave the way to reforms. The second half of 1994 will be a time 
of genuine reforms which would start the mechanism of 
self-regulation of the economy," Ivan Zayets has stated. 
  Volodymyr Lanovoy, former first vice premier for questions 
of 
economic reform and now general director of the Center for 
Market Reforms, spoke on the same subject in more restrained 
terms. He stated that Ukraine needed a government of reformers 
that would carry out reforms, and only then "will Ukraine see in 
the next New Year with a different mood."

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by Dmitriy </F>
Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] In an interview with Interfax Deputy Foreign 
Minister Sergey Lavrov said he hoped that in 1994 problems in 
relations between Russia and Ukraine would be resolved, and that 
bilateral ties would develop on the basis of "friendliness and 
fraternity." 
  According to Lavrov, these problems, above all issues 
connected with the destiny of nuclear arms and the Black Sea 
Fleet, must not be dramatized. "We must not forget that a vast 
country with an enormous infrastructure disintegrated," he said. 
"As soon as the two major problems are resolved, onward 
movement will begin in all areas of relations between Russia and 
Ukraine." 
  Preconditions for resolving these problems were ensured when 
the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid 
Kravchuk met in Massandra. 
  According to Interfax's interviewee, there are not only 
"sore" but also "healthy spots" in the Russian-Ukrainian 
relationship. At their meeting in Odessa held at the end of 
last year Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his 
Ukrainian counterpart Anatoliy Zlenko agreed to cooperate in 
resolving problems connected with the further development of 
Eastern and Central Europe. "The Ukrainian side assured us that 
Kiev's initiatives on the ways to promote cooperation between 
local countries provide for Russia's participation, not 
exclusion," Lavrov said. 
  According to him, Russia is interested in cooperating with 
Ukraine and other CIS countries in international organizations. 
At the latest UN General Assembly session the 12 CIS states 
advanced, for the first time ever, joint initiatives concerning 
the ways to combat drug trafficking, terrorism and environmental 
pollution. "It is noteworthy that the resolution on monitoring 
environmental protection from space submitted by the CIS 
countries was adopted by consensus," Lavrov said. 
  Interfax's interviewee drew attention to the circumstance 
that participants at the Ashgabat summit held at the end of last 
year decided to jointly request the UN to grant the CIS the 
status of observer of the kind enjoyed by, say, the European 
Union or the Organization of African Unity. 
  As Lavrov said, this decision was taken unanimously. Ukraine 
alone stood aside. "Ukraine abstained. Kiev voiced doubts as 
to the CIS being an "organization." But this is a purely 
terminological dispute," Lavrov noted. "There should be no fears 
that the CIS is turning into some "supranational mechanism." 
From the point of view of international law the term 
"organization" does not reflect "supranationalism."

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal </F>
Democratic Party of Russia, in Moscow, by Poivre d'Arvor in 
Paris -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [D'Arvor] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's European tour 
was marked by scandal. Three weeks after his success in the 
elections, he was expelled from Bulgaria. He is persona non 
grata in Austria, and Germany refused him a visa. He 
subsequently threatened Germany with a third world war. We have 
with us live Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. Good evening. It is hard to 
believe you when you say that you wish to crush Germany in a 
third world war when you come to power. Did you really say that? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No. I wanted to visit Germany once again. I 
visited Germany previously, on four occasions, but I would like 
to say that if future events in Russia unfold as they do now, or 
as they do in the Balkans, or in some other parts of the world, 
a third world war may break out one day. I want to prevent 
this, I want to take measures now to prevent the risks of a new 
world war. 
  [D'Arvor] You seem to long for a Russia that would expand 
into a Great Russia. You say you wish to recover the Baltic 
states, Finland, and Poland. Where will your yearning for 
expansion stop? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] No expansion. On the contrary, we now have a 
situation where, for instance, Tajikistan and some 
Transcaucasian republics want to be with Russia once again. But 
I for one, together with my party, do not want this. We want 
the opposite. This is a recurrent lie. I say these countries 
should develop on their own as independent states, but I also 
say they will never be like independent states, because they 
joined Russia 200 years ago. This was always the tragedy of 
these peoples. They tell me they have no possibility of being 
[independent] states, now this is the same problem, always the 
tragedy of Tajiks, or of Georgians, of Armenians, of Azeris. 
  We are [word indistinct] here in Russia and I favor the 
pullout of all Russian troops back to Russia, to Moscow. You 
will see for yourself that a terrible war will start there 
between Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and 
Iran. The same thing is happening now in Afghanistan, without a 
president, without a government, with gangs, with groups, with a 
commander or something similar. 
  This is not a state, this is not civilization. This is 
already a part of the third world war because there are millions 
and millions of people living there, and they are in a situation 
of civil war within their country, or in a state of war with 
other states: Armenia and Azerbaijan, Abkhazia and Georgia, 
Tajikistan and Afghanistan. This is already a part of the world 
war because it is a vast territory from India to Athens, to 
Serbia. It is larger than Europe during the World War II. 
  [D'Arvor] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, do you yourself wish to return 
to 
the former Great Russia, that of the tsars? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I want to see our state within its historical 
borders, but not through violent means, only through economic 
means, through civilization, culture, law. For instance, if one 
day they want to return, if they call on us, and if you in the 
West, in Paris or in London, say we too will help these people 
to live, to remain alive, then perhaps can we take positive 
steps. However, now, we do not want them to come back within 
Russia, all the peoples from the south, from Tajikistan to 
Chisinau. We do not want this, my party and I are against this. 
  [D'Arvor] Does this include the Baltic states? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, the Baltic states too, but I say we must 
have economic relations. This does not mean constant aid for 
the Baltic states. If we stop selling our energy and mineral 
resources cheaply to the Baltic states, contrary to what we are 
doing now, their existence as independent states is over. I 
say: If I lead the Russian Government, we will immediately stop 
all economic aid to the Baltic states and to any other country. 
Trade yes, but pay, pay: Pay with hard currencies and no more 
economic aid. After that, the existence of the Baltic states as 
independent states is over. 
  [D'Arvor] I understand. When you say if I lead the Russian 
Government, does this mean that you wish to replace the current 
prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Could you repeat your question more slowly? 
  [D'Arvor] Do you wish to see the current prime minister, 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, resign and hand over power to you? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I believe that he will stay for a few months, 
but in March or April, we will have another prime minister. Our 
president, Mr. Yeltsin, wants to keep Viktor Chernomyrdin as 
prime minister and also some other ministers from the previous 
government. It is their ultimate mistake; if they make it, it 
will be over for this government in April, and we will have a 
government led not by myself -- I know I said that I would lead 
the government -- but by a more neutral person, perhaps from 
Siberia. He will lead the new Russian Government with new 
ministers, but Mr. Gaydar's team, with its conception of this 
economic reform that only brings negative results...[pauses] 
Programs must be changed, we need reforms, but through other 
programs. It is the same as medicine: You must have medication, 
but prescribed by another doctor. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal </F>
Democratic Party of Russia, in Moscow, by Heiner Bremer in 
Cologne on 3 January--recorded; Zhirinovskiy speaks in Russian 
with superimposed German translation] 
  [Text] [Bremer] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, a few days ago, you 
threatened Germany with World War III. Shortly before that, 
however, you celebrated the natural alliance between the 
Russians and the Germans. How are we Germans supposed to 
understand this contradiction? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I think there should be the best possible 
relations between Russia and Germany. Germany should finally 
become a free country. The problem was that the German consul 
in Sofia canceled my entry visa. I have visited Germany four 
times already. I am a friend of the Germans. The consul made a 
political mistake and so has the German foreign minister. 
However, I differentiate between the German people and its 
officials. After all, they are around only for a limited period 
of time. 
  [Bremer] You not only threatened World War III, but you also 
announced that you would break off diplomatic relations and stop 
the withdrawal of Russian troops. You even want compensation 
for World War II. Mr. Zhirinovskiy, are you surprised that you 
are not very highly regarded in Germany, that Germany does not 
really want to have any dealings with you? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I have a number of friends in Germany. These 
are mainly parties like the German People's Union and others. 
Millions of Germans support our policy of friendship and equal 
relations with Germany. As for reparation payments, this is not 
supposed to be an attack against Germany; but why did Germany 
pay compensation to the Jews after World War II and not anything 
to the Russians? It was not the Jews but the Russians who were 
victorious over the German troops and marched into Berlin. 
  [Bremer] But, Mr. Zhirinovskiy, there is a difference 
between two nations fighting each other in a world war and one 
nation, namely the German one, doing severe injustice to another 
nation, namely the Jewish one. 
  [Zhirinovskiy] Well, let us not compare these two things 
then. We are not demanding anything; we do not insist on 
anything. But I ask myself: If the Russian troops withdraw from 
Germany, then why do the French, Americans, and British stay? 
All occupation forces have to leave Germany. The Germans want 
to be free. This includes the Germans' right to live free of 
foreigners. Why do the Germans constantly have to live with 
occupation forces? We want to help Germany. Let me put it this 
way: I declare my affection for Germany, I declare my 
friendship. But I see with concern that there are a number of 
problems in Germany. The Gypsies and Turks have a firm grip of 
the country. Millions of foreigners are disturbing the Germans' 
lives. It is they who disturb the Germans, not us. The Germans 
and the Russians are friends forever. And yet, I am refused an 
entry visa. This is absurd. 
  [Bremer] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, your answer shows that you should 
travel through Germany at your leisure, and maybe not only 
accompanied by your friend [German People's Union Chairman] 
Frey. It is, of course, nonsense to say that Germany is 
controlled by Turks and other foreigners. The Turks who have 
been living in Germany for a long time did a great deal of 
reconstruction work here. We are perfectly capable of tackling 
our country's problems by ourselves. Do you think that we 
should not look ahead, that we should continue the peace 
process, begun under your President Yeltsin, together, instead 
of bringing uncertainty into the relations by your radical 
demands? 
  [Zhirinovskiy] I do not think so. I do not want to 
interfere with German affairs. It is simply a matter of good 
relations between Russia and Germany. We also have our own 
problems, which we will be able to solve without external 
interference. By no means are we planning any aggression toward 
the West.

<F P=106> [Article by Hans Faber and Peter de Waard: "Employee in </F>
Moscow Confirms Donation to Zhirinovskiy; Controversial 
Businessman Allegedly Supported Other Parties Too"] 
  [Text] Amsterdam, 31 Dec -- Anton Nenachov, a Russian 
investment consultant and owner of the controversial, 
Amsterdam-based company Global Money Management Trust (GMM), 
donated money to ultra-right-wing Russian politician Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy's electoral campaign. According to B. Van der 
Meer, one of Nenachov's employees, the donation amounted to 
roughly $50,000. Nenakov has admitted this to Van der Meert. 
  According to the Moscow office's Dutch employee, Nenachov 
also co-financed campaigns of other Russian political parties. 
"Nenachov also donated $50,000 to Gaydar, the democratic 
candidate," Van der Meer claims. "This is also true for the 
other important candidates." 
  He denies that the 27-year old Nenakov co-financed 
Zhirinovskiy's $800,000 campaign through his Netherlands 
companies. "There have not been any flows of money through 
Amsterdam," Van der Meer says. The Amsterdam-based GMM was 
discredited last Wednesday after the Russian newspaper SEGODNYA 
reported that Nenachov had sponsored Zhirinovskiy through this 
company. 
  According to the GMM staff member, Nenachov did not pay 
Zhirinovskiy on account of his political preference for an 
ultra- right-wing politician. "As an entrepreneur, you have to 
be pragmatic as far as politics are concerned. Nenachov has one 
political preference: money." According to Van der Meert, 
Nenachov made the payments in his capacity as a private 
individual." 
  Partly as a result of the fuss raised, the Economic Control 
Service [ECD] launched an investigation into GMM's activities 
and into its Russian manager-shareholder. The control service 
has already contacted De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) about the case. 
  However, the central bank is not the formal authority 
entitled to give instructions to the ECD. This is the purview 
of the Finance Ministry, in close consultation with the central 
bank. The Finance Ministry said that it is still considering 
whether the ECD will be called in. 
  Nenachov's employee says he is "pleased" with the control 
service's investigation. "We will render our assistance. This 
way, we will be able to prove our innocence," Van der Meert says. 
  The ECD investigation will not focus on GMM's and Nenachov's 
political sympathies, but on possible economic offenses 
committed by the company, in contravention of Article 82 of the 
Law on the Inspection of Crediting. The DNB has recently sent a 
letter to GMM, in which the bank warned the company not to do 
any banking business. To that effect, the bank also invoked 
Article 82, which stipulates that non-banks and non-investment 
companies are not entitled to attract capital. 
  This article also forbids institutions established in the 
Netherlands to attract money from abroad. GMM is allegedly 
involved in large-scale money-raising operations in Russia. The 
company, which also has an office in Moscow, has daily 
commercials on Russian television. 
  GMM has already been in conflict with a Dutch institution on 
a previous occasion. Some three months ago, the ABN Amro 
discontinued its credit relationship with the company. The bank 
took offense to Nenakov's assertion in Russia that the GMM 
office in Moscow is an ABN Amro Russian subsidiary. 
  According to Van der Meer, "Nenachov is merely an 
enthusiastic Russian, who is not aware that you have to keep 
strictly to the rules in the Netherlands. Things are quite 
different in Russia." In the Netherlands, GMM is banking with 
the U.S. Citibank. 
  The GMM case has embarrassed Nenachov's adviser. L. 
Gribling, a close assistant and employed by the accounting 
office Arenthals/Chaudron, has gone on vacation. The office 
issued a statement that it will break off its relation with 
Nenachov if "illegal practices" are revealed. 
Arenthals/Chaudron denies any involvement in the financing of 
Zhirinovskiy's campaign.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Russian Central Bank Warns </F>
Netherlands Assets Management Firm"] 
  [Text] Moscow -- The Russian Central Bank yesterday issued 
a written warning against the Netherlands assets management firm 
GMM bv [Global Money Management, Inc.], which is principally 
active in the Russian market. The warning comes just days after 
the disclosure by SEGODNYA, the Russian daily, that GMM had 
financed the election campaign by ultra-nationalist 
Zhirinovskiy. 
  In a letter, the bank wrote that the illegal activities of 
GMM constitute a "direct threat to the interests of people who 
have entrusted the firm with their money." 
  GMM is operating illegally as it does not have a bank 
license. According to A. Nenachov, the Russian director and sole 
shareholder in the Netherlands bv, this is not necessary as GMM 
is a trust company. Russian law makes no provision for this 
kind of institution. 
  The Russian Finance Ministry issued an identical statement 
at 
the end of October, but this was not acted upon. The political 
allegations made by SEGODNYA shed new light on the affair. The 
only basis for this warning is that a member of Zhirinovskiy's 
liberal party, Aleksey Zoyjev, is an adviser to GMM. 
  The Russian daily SEGODNYA is financed by MOST bank, one of 
three commercial banks which supported the election campaign by 
Russia's Choice. Russia's Choice Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar 
unexpectedly lost to Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Party in the 
elections. Russia's Choice has been seeking an explanation for 
Zhirinovskiy's success ever since. After allegations that 
former members of the KGB financed and supported the Liberal 
Party, the GMM is now being used as a scapegoat. 
  Shortly before the elections, Russia's Choice was itself 
involved in a scandal. The U.S. marketing company Sawyer Miller 
Group produced advertising on Russian television for Gaydar's 
party. This was part of a privatization campaign conducted by 
Sawyer Miller with U.S. Government money. Instead of the usual 
slogan -- "Your voucher, your choice" -- Sawyer Miller broadcast 
an advertisement immediately before the elections with the 
slogan "Your choice, Russia's choice." 
  GMM's activities are scarcely any different than those of 
other Russian financial institutions which are earning large 
amounts of capital in Russia's economic climate of high 
inflation. The only grounds for criticism is that GMM presents 
itself as an experienced Netherlands player on stock exchanges 
in places such as Amsterdam, New York, and Tokyo. GMM, however, 
is not really involved in such activities, but such a claim 
relieves the firm of the obligation to apply for a bank license 
in Russia. The company is in fact an inactive "incorporated 
company" which was taken over and given new life by 27-year-old 
Muscovite Nenachov, who also set up Moscow's first federal bank. 
  This is the first time that one of the new capitalist 
institutions which flourished under Gaydar's influence has been 
involved in a political scandal. GMM's Moscow office is closed 
at the moment for the "New Year holidays."

<F P=106> [Mikhail Leontyev report: "Zhirinovskiy's Party Vote May Be </F>
Annulled"] 
  [Text] It took the Russian Central Bank half a day to 
react to an article in SEGODNYA on Zhirinovskiy's being financed 
by GMM, a Dutch "trust" company carrying out illegal operations 
in Russia. The Central Bank has issued a press release 
confirming that GMM's operations are illegal and saying that its 
activity "jeopardizes the interests of citizens who have 
entrusted their savings to it." Curiously, repeated requests by 
the Foreign Ministry demanding that the Dutch company, which has 
been conducting purely banking operations in Russia without 
bothering to obtain any license, be properly dealt with have 
been stubbornly ignored by the Central Bank. Nor was Mr. 
Gerashchenko's office impressed by an entirely convincing 
article in IZVESTIYA on oddities in GMM's activity. 
  Obviously, it was the political context in which he has 
found 
himself owing to his friendship with GMM that impressed Mr. 
Gerashchenko so strongly in this particular case. Any unbiased 
observer can draw this fairly simple sequence of logical 
conclusions: the Central Bank chairman, whose position has been 
fairly shaky of late, has been covering the illegal activity of 
a company of financial black marketeers; the company finances 
the penetration into the parliament of deputies meeting its 
moral and political standards; subsequently, the deputies 
appoint Gerashchenko Central Bank chairman. The only 
inconvenience is that the paid deputies are Nazis of sorts. 
However, the stunning impudence such people tend to display on 
Russian soil has precluded their thinking that anyone might take 
a serious interest in this. 
  The behavior of Mr. Gerashchenko, whom Anton Nenakhov, chief 
of GMM's Moscow branch, was praising to the skies in the 
"Without Retouching" television program (at the same time 
fulminating against Finance Minister Boris Fedorov), is also 
very peculiar. Initially he covered the "trust" company's 
activity, allowing it to collect millions of dollars from the 
population, then, upon suddenly seeing the light, he called it 
illegal, thus effectively assuring the bankruptcy of tens of 
thousands of investors. One cannot help getting a strange 
impression: What if this is a deliberately fabricated affair? 
Yet more indirect evidence is that the Central Bank, as far as 
I know, has not frozen GMM's accounts. Hence, investors' money 
can be siphoned away -- according to its commercial -- round the 
clock throughout the world. 
  The answer to a popular question of to whom one should 
address one's claims is simple -- to the Central Bank and its 
chairman. Generally speaking, bureaucrats in a normal society 
would at least resign in similar circumstances. 
  Self-assurance prevented the hapless "businessmen" from 
noting that financing Nazis is seen as something extremely 
inappropriate in civilized countries. As a result, the Dutch 
Foreign Ministry has launched an investigation into the activity 
of GMM, which turned out to have had no right to engage in 
overseas trust operations under the legislation of Holland 
(which, unlike this country, does have a trust law). When asked 
by DE VOLLKSRANT, a Mr. Van de Meer, a GMM official in 
Amsterdam, said that GMM gave Zhirinovskiy as little as $50,000. 
He claims that the "trust" company also financed other 
"important" candidates, and that large amounts were handed to 
"Russia's Choice." Election campaign chiefs of "Russia's 
Choice" insist, however, that the bloc has not taken any money 
from either GMM or any other foreign companies. 
  According to the aforementioned Mr. Van de Meer, his chief, 
Nenakhov, personally supported a number of candidates as a 
private person, guided by his own preferences. Van de Meer sees 
this policy as reasonable. "Mr. Nenakhov has one single 
political preference, which is money," the official says. The 
ingenuity multiplied by his deliberate unscrupulousness may turn 
out to be not so "reasonable" as some Western partners tend to 
think, mistaking Russia for a banana republic. Under Russian 
laws, financing an election campaign of a candidate or a bloc 
from foreign sources may give grounds for annulling the votes 
cast for the candidates or blocs. Unless we are a banana 
republic indeed.

<F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report under the "Details" rubric: "Has the </F>
LDPR's Money Been Found?"] 
  [Text] ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD writes that the Dutch economic 
monitoring service and the Central Bank of Russia have decided 
to begin an investigation into an article in SEGODNYA according 
to which the GMM trust company, registered in the Netherlands, 
lent financial support to V. Zhirinovskiy during his election 
campaign in Russia. The political aspects are not the issue 
here, according to the newspaper, but possible violations of the 
law on granting credits. 
  Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUN, touching on press reports that the 
Dutch company GMM granted Zhirinovskiy's party $800,000 to fund 
its election expenses, remarks in its commentary: "So far there 
is no precise information suggesting the Dutch company's role in 
financing the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], but as 
of today it has been definitely confirmed that branches of the 
Zhirinovskiy party election campaign had premises in GMM 
advertising branches in Russia, and that the Dutch company's 
advertising and Zhirinovskiy's election campaign were funded 
from the same source. 
  "Light may be thrown on the Dutch firm's role in funding the 
LDPR in the near future, since the Netherlands Ministry of 
Finance has begun an investigation into GMM's activity, using as 
a pretext this firm's breach of national laws on security 
transactions."

<F P=106> [Article by Leonid Mlechin: "The Russian Question in </F>
Russian Politics in 1994"] 
  [Text] The Russian question is a highly important issue of 
Moscow's diplomacy in the new year. The opposition attacks the 
president precisely in this area, where it knows it cannot fail 
to win. 
  The instinctive reaction to the 12 December elections is: 
Russian diplomats should urgently tackle the problem of the 
Russians who were left outside Russia's borders. The task is to 
wrest the aces from the hands of the nationalists, who 
successfully scored points on this issue, and to prove that the 
democratic government is capable of sorting things out for the 
Russians in the former Soviet republics. 
  However, if Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev rushes to do 
something now, this will be credited to the opposition. 
Diplomats' activity would be interpreted in one way only: They 
are moving because they were frightened by Zhirinovskiy. 
  This claim is unjust. It is improper to accuse the 
Yeltsin-Kozyrev policy of neglecting the Russian question. They 
have encountered a problem which, as history shows, has no ideal 
solution. 
  Pure diplomacy, negotiations, UN resolutions, and appeals to 
international organizations and to the two supreme commissioners 
for human rights (Europe's CSCE commissioner and the world's UN 
commissoner) do not have the power to change the situation 
radically. Only by restoring the USSR is it possible to really 
reassure Russians living outside Russia and return to them their 
lost spiritual well-being. No other solutions will bring the 
desired relief to all Russians living abroad. 
  The most able actions by Russian diplomats, even if they 
manage, for example, to win some kind of concessions from the 
governments of the Baltic republics, will be unable to change 
the atmosphere in the Baltic region, where Russians and 
Russian-speakers are regarded as an alien element, and are at 
best tolerated. 
  It is as possible to make Estonians, Latvians, and 
Lithuanians think differently as it is to erase from the pages 
of history the occupation of the Baltic region by Soviet troops 
in 1940, the deportations, and, in general, the half-century of 
lording it in the three republics. 
  Of course, it is possible to make threats, to resort to 
strong-arm blackmail, to make use of the services of the 
military department, to refuse to withdraw troops from the 
Baltic region, or even to dispatch additional units there. 
  The idea of "enlightened nationalism" and the hope of taking 
over the slogans of the nationalists are sufficiently naive: 
The original is always preferable to a copy. So if the 
liberals decide that the troops who still remain in the Baltic 
region can be used as an instrument of pressure, then the 
citizens of our country are more likely to support those who 
have long been demanding the use of force against "Baltic 
nationalists." Then there would be a new government in the 
Kremlin, and this government would manage without Yeltsin and 
without Kozyrev. 
  The present government does not have the right to make a 
favorable impression on the public by offending neighboring 
states and boldly promising who-knows-what. 
  But it is making one unforgivable mistake: Andrey Kozyrev 
and his apparatus have not taken the trouble to prove 
to the Russian public that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is 
seriously concerned over this problem. If the ministry is doing 
something, if it is trying for some kind of success, then very 
few people know about it. 
  Judging by reports from embassies and all the information 
at Moscow's disposal, the majority of Russians outside Russia 
want to remain living where they are. And it is from this 
premise that the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is 
operating, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told IZVESTIYA. 
It is necessary to ensure at the state level the legal basis of 
their lives outside Russia, to help Russian communities preserve 
their language and culture and receive education in their native 
tongue. 
  In the very near future the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is 
to 
make yet another attempt to get the government to adopt a 
program to improve the life of Russians beyond Russia's borders. 
However, it is not known where the money necessary to implement 
this will come from. 
  A few days before the new year the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs administration dealing with the planning and forecasting 
of foreign policy ceased to exist. Some of its staff will be 
transferred to the CIS department. Instead of global studies 
they will be handling the problems of the former Union republics. 
  A very important issue now is to see that those seeking dual 
citizenship are granted it. This will to some degree guarantee 
Russians protection and enable them to move to Russia in 
critical situations. CIS leaders agreed on this principle, but 
are now drawing back from signing agreements on a bilateral 
basis. 
  In Sergey Lavrov's opinion, this is mainly because they do 
not fully comprehend the real significance of dual citizenship, 
supposing that it frees the holders of two passports from the 
fulfillment of all obligations to the state. In actual fact 
dual citizenship only grants "nonindigenous" inhabitants equal 
rights with "indigenous" inhabitants, but by no means frees them 
from responsibility. A holder of two passports is answerable 
for a crime he has committed in the place that he committed it, 
and serves in the army in the place of his permanent residence. 
  What else can diplomats do in real terms? 
  We can prove to Western politicians and Western public 
opinion that their former sympathetic approach to the Baltic 
republics which suffered under the Soviet yoke is outdated. 
Western pressure is the only way to force the Baltic leaders to 
make concessions. 
  We msut tirelessly seek out sensible people in Tallin and 
Riga and negotiate with them: Surely Estonian and Latvian 
politicians do not really think that some kind of NATO will save 
them if people with Zhirinovskiy's mentality come to power in 
Moscow?

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kuleshov report: "Rights of Migrants Under </F>
Protection. Turkmen-Russian Agreements on Dual Citizenship and 
the Protection of Migrants' Rights Could Become a Model for 
Other CIS Member Countries"] 
  [Text] Ashgabat -- Actually, even before, it was not 
necessary to flee from Turkmenistan: The problem widely termed 
"the problem of the Russian-speaking population in nearby 
foreign countries" in several of the former Union republics did 
not exist here. "But," Turkmen President S. Niyazov stressed in 
an interview with IZVESTIYA, "it would be arrantly superficial 
not to see or understand that, for many reasons, the growth of 
national self-consciousness is everywhere, including in our 
country, accompanied by negative tendencies..." 
  These "tendencies" are most commonly encountered at a 
mundane 
level. But now, the Turkmen government assures me, following 
the high-level signing of agreements "On the Regulation of 
Questions of Dual Citizenship" and "On the Regulation of the 
Process of Resettlement and the Protection of the Rights of 
Migrants," the situation around Russians could radically change 
for the better, and people will feel completely at ease. 
  "Each side" -- I am reading from the text of the first 
document -- "recognizes its citizens' right to acquire the 
citizenship of the other country without losing the citizenship 
of their own...." "A person who is a citizen of both countries 
fully enjoys the rights and freedoms, and also carries the 
obligations, of the country on whose territory he resides 
permanently..." 
  And this means that whether you are Turkmen or Russian, 
Uzbek 
or Armenian, no one will now prohibit you, if you currently live 
in Turkmenistan, from obtaining a Russian passport. And the 
same goes for those who, living in Russia, want to acquire 
Turkmen citizenship: Just go to the Turkmen Embassy in Moscow 
and get the green passport that denotes citizenship of 
Turkmenistan. And, praise God, we already have an example of 
this -- Boris Yeltsin was the first citizen of Russia, by 
acquiring Turkmen citizenship, to receive such a document.... 
  Migrants are another aspect of the question. 
  "Well, if you have made up your mind to go, at least do it 
in 
a civilized manner," Russian Ambassador to Turkmenistan Vadim 
Cherepov says. "First register as a migrant, and then both 
sides are obliged to assist you in privatizing and selling your 
house, conveying all your domestic property to your new place of 
residence in Russia, and transferring funds..." 
  Excluding all forms of discrimination against migrants on 
political, socioeconomic, ethnic, or religious grounds, the 
agreement on the protection of migrants' rights especially 
stresses: "Migrants and their families have the right to convey 
from the state they are leaving all movables in their 
possession, with the exception of items that are prohibited 
under the laws of that state. They can sell, bestow, exchange, 
bequeath at their discretion, or otherwise dispose of property 
in their possession...." 
  Few people are aware how difficult it was for officials of 
the Russian Embassy in Turkmenistan and the Russian Federal 
Migration Service to uphold these lines, without which the whole 
document would not be worth a dime. Well, judge for yourself 
how much protection migrants would have if they were forbidden 
not only to sell their privatized apartments in Turkmenistan -- 
selling, exchanging, or bestowing them was forbidden by 
presidential edict -- but even, given the harsh rules 
restricting the exportation of objects and valuables, to take 
with them to Russia the household chattels they had scraped 
together here. 
  "When we discussed this question with the various 
authorities," Vadim Cherepov recalls, "I constantly had to 
remind our interlocutors: `Hundreds, even thousands of Turkmens 
are privatizing their apartments in Moscow; moreover, many of 
these apartments are in the capital's best apartment blocks. If 
they have to, they later sell them, asking from 50 to 100 
million rubles for them. No one objects to this or forbids them 
to take their money to Turkmenistan. So what is worse about 
Russians wanting to sell their homes in Ashgabat, Krasnovodsk, 
or other Turkmen cities in order to go to Russia and buy 
apartments there with the money. Come, I said, let us resolve 
this problem at a bilateral level...'" 
  Much, I repeat, has been resolved. Even, it would appear, 
such trivial points as the following: 
  "The sides guarantee migrants and their families freedom 
from 
all restrictions on importing or exporting their personal 
property, and also from customs duties, taxes, and levies 
associated with this process. Monetary funds and transferred 
monetary deposits are exempted from levies..."

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by Dmitriy </F>
Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russia's Foreign Ministry is not inclined to "react 
in earnest" to the numerous declarations of the former chairman 
of Lithuania's parliament and now right-wing opposition leader, 
Vytautas Landsbergis. To argue with him is as pointless as with 
the Liberal Democratic Party leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, said 
a high-ranking Russian diplomat dealing with Baltic problems in 
comments on recent statements by Landsbergis concerning 
relations with Russia. 
  Speaking at a recent news conference in Vilnius, Landsbergis 
criticized the present Lithuanian leadership for its "policy of 
rapprochement with the East." 
  According to Landsbergis, "the last few months fully 
revealed 
the aggressive nationalism of Russia, whose policy had been 
identical to that of Zhirinovskiy, who only speaks more openly." 
  "Such escapades by Landsbergis are no longer surprising," 
said the Russian diplomat. "They have become so biased and 
subjective, that they can hardly be taken seriously, even in 
Lithuania itself," he said. 
  According to the diplomat, Vilnius' current foreign policy 
is 
aimed only at normalizing relations with all countries, 
including Russia, and not at rapprochement with the East. From 
this point of view he noted "certain achievements gained by 
Lithuania's present leadership." "Neighboring countries should 
live in peace and cooperate on a mutually-beneficial basis. 
This is an axiom, and to dispute it is senseless," the diplomat 
said. 
  According to him, "what motivates Landsbergis is largely 
political jealousy, since Lithuania's current president, 
Algirdas Brazauskas, has managed to achieve in the 
foreign-policy area much of what the right-wing radicals failed 
to achieve during their stay in power."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Naumov report: "Fate of `Cosmic' Deal"] </F>
  [Text] The new year is beginning propitiously for 
Russian-Indian cooperation in space matters. The editorial 
office possesses reliable information that the sides have at 
last succeeded in emerging from the ticklish situation which 
developed following the suspension of the agreement on the joint 
development of a cryogenic booster unit [CBU]. 
  It was signed by the Glavkosmos [Main Administration for the 
Development and Use of Space Technology for the National Economy 
and Scientific Research] and the Indian Space Research 
Organization [ISRO] in 1991 and provided for the transfer of 
Russian cryogenic space technologies to India and for the 
instruction and training of specialists. The contracts were 
worth 2.35 billion rupees. By the time the agreement had been 
declared a violation of the missile technology control regime 
[MTCR] (in the opinion of some experts, the very fact of a 
violation is highly debatable), the Indians had already paid us 
1.297 billion rupees (approximately 60 percent of the total). 
  For this money the Glavkosmos passed to the ISRO 90 percent 
of the technical documentation and certain equipment needed to 
organize production. In an instant all this "property" became 
useless, since there could be no question of continuing 
deliveries worth more than 1 billion rupees. In addition, the 
Indian space program, which is entirely dependent on the joint 
development of the CBU, found itself in jeopardy. 
  It was in these starting conditions that the sides started 
debating the project's future. Three times the talks were on 
the verge of failure. Nevertheless, an acceptable solution was 
found. In the opinion of specialists, the new version of the 
agreement will fit fully within the "Procrustean bed" of the 
MTCR. 
  What, then, has been agreed? Instead of technologies, the 
Glavkosmos will supply two additional CBU flight stages and 
technological equipment for their operation for the outstanding 
sum. It will pass to India two mockup units: A service one to 
complete the ground servicing complex and a dynamic one to "fit" 
it to the launch complex. 
  In addition, an additional agreement has been concluded on 
the delivery of three more Russian-made finished flight stages. 
Each of them will cost $3 million. This will enable India not 
to curtail independent space research but merely to correct its 
program. 
  The purchaser has pledged to use the equipment obtained from 
the Glavkosmos exclusively for peaceful purposes -- to launch 
telecommunications satellites and other useful civilian payloads 
into orbit. India has agreed to a requirement not to reexport 
it to third countries and not to modernize without Russia's 
consent. Our specialists' access to places where all the space 
rockets which will use the units being sold as the third stage 
are assembled, tested, and launched will also be ensured. 
  The first Russian CBU's will be handed over to the ISRO in 
1996. But the Indians are prepared to pay one-half of the cost 
in advance ($4.5 million) as early as January 1994. In 
conditions when the Glavkosmos is finding it hard to find the 
money to support the space rocket complex, these dollars will 
come in handy. 
  The accords that have been reached are very important. They 
will not only enable Russia to "save face" as a reliable partner 
in international cooperation but will also ensure employment for 
15,000 of our compatriots -- working people in the space 
industry -- through the year 2000. 
  Thanks to the new agreement, experts believe, Russia and 
India will preserve the trade and scientific ties developed over 
the years. It is not hard to predict what the outcome would 
have been if this had not happened: In full accordance with the 
proverb "nature abhors a vacuum," our niche in the market for 
space services would be taken over by leading French and U.S. 
firms. They have long been looking longingly at this region.

<F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 5 TASS -- NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
(INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER) on consultations on the candidacy of a 
State Duma speaker: "A regular round of consultations among 
the leaders of electoral associations on the candidacy of a 
future chairman of the State Duma continued in Moscow on Tuesday 
[4 January] afternoon. The consultations are not yet over and 
the final results of the round are not yet known. However, this 
round is apparently not the final one: The talks will be 
continued, with only a recess for Christmas, right up to the 
opening of a Duma session, Ivan Rybkin, one of the leaders of 
the Agrarian Party, told the newspaper. Various names of 
candidates were mentioned during the consultations. Rybkin, 
whose candidacy was named as well, said he personally regards as 
fruitful the idea of electing four deputy speakers. This will 
make it possible to ensure the stability of the ship called the 
State Duma, for the more interests are represented in its 
leadership, the more stable it will be." 
  TRUD on the reform-minded blocs' defeat in the recent 
elections: "The paradox of the past elections is that, 
notwithstanding the lack of victors, there still are the 
vanquished -- reform-minded blocs. If they, while counting on 
winning a majority in parliament, did not get it, this cannot be 
called otherwise than a defeat. There is one hope, namely, that 
all political forces from the very outset will renounce 
orientation towards confrontation or political accusations 
against one another and will come to realise that such a path 
has already been traversed completely and it did not lead to 
anything but trouble". 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on why State Duma deputies are so 
preoccupied with the speaker election issue: "There is one 
disquieting circustance: The talks, a regular round of which was 
held on Tuesday, focus on the search for a candidacy of a State 
Duma speaker. Why does this question worry the deputies so 
much? Under the new constitution, the speaker is a purely 
functional figure: He will preside over sessions and see to it 
that internal rules and regulations are observed. Neither party 
affiliation, attitude to reforms, nor a stand with regard to the 
government and the president should be decisive in a speaker's 
characteristics: only tactfulness, organising ability, an 
aptitude for the establishment of contacts, and loyalty to 
various points of view. It is not so difficult to find such a 
person among 450 deputies provided there is accord on 
priorities. But the matter, apparently, is precisely in 
priorities. This is actually the result of deeply ingrained 
habits of the soviet times: The main thing is what kind of a 
boss one will have, not the law (in this case -- fundamental 
law). If the boss is not an outsider, then one has a chance for 
promotion, etc. If the boss is a stranger, one would have 
additional problems". 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the possibility of Ukrainian 
President 
Leonid Kravchuk's participation in the forthcoming Russian-U.S. 
summit in Moscow: "The Ukrainian president's foreign affairs 
service has expressed doubt about the possibility of Kravchuk's 
participating in Moscow talks among the presidents of Ukraine, 
Russia and the United States on January 14, 1994, on the future 
of Ukrainian strategic nuclear weapons. The summit will 
coincide with an official visit to Kiev by President Nursultan 
Nazarabayev of Kazakhstan, the presidential service announced. 
According to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, a meeting of the 
presidents of the U.S., Russia and Ukraine in Moscow is still 
possible but it will depend on the outcome of the ongoing talks 
in Washington which involve Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister 
Borys Tarasyuk and Vice-Premier for Defence-Sector Issues Valery 
Shmarov". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) carries an interview with 
Stanislav Voronin, chief designer of Russian nuclear and 
thermo-nuclear weapons, who emphasises: "One does not toy with 
an atomic bomb in political games! Some politicians state that 
nuclear weapons can be dismantled in Ukraine. This is an 
ill-intentioned attempt to mislead public opinion. in Ukraine, 
there are neither specialists of the needed qualification, nor 
facilities, nor experience in dismantling nukes". 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA runs an interview with Dmitry Volkogonov, 
adviser to the president of Russia on defence affairs. He said: 
"I could never agree that the army as one of major instruments 
of the state can be outside politics. Yes, it must be outside 
party-motivated politics but it cannot be outside state 
politics. The army should adhere to the course followed by the 
government and the president, who is the supreme 
commander-in-chief, the course towards security, the official 
course towards the armed forces' development, towards reforms, 
etc.". 
  PRAVDA on an attempt on the life of Aleksandr Barkashov, 
leader of the banned Russian National Unity Movement: "Could it 
be that the shoot-out in which Barkashov was heavily wounded was 
the consequence of his knowing some details of the firing on the 
parliament building?" 
  St. Petersburg's-based NEVSKOYE VREMYA newspaper on an 
explosion and fire near metro station: "An explosion, followed 
by a heavy fire, occurred at the entrance to the Russo-Italian 
shoe shop Marcopizii near Petrogradskaya metro station four 
hours before the advent of the new year. The blast smashed the 
stained-glass partition separating the shop and the hallway of 
the metro station. No one was hurt but many people were unable 
to get home by midnight -- the metro station was promptly closed 
down. Criminal proceedings have been instituted."

  [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is likely to 
arrive in Moscow on January 14 to meet with U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  According to a well-informed source, Bill Clinton had 
invited 
Leonid Kravchuk to attend the Russian-American summit. 
  On January 3, tripartite talks began in Washington between 
U.S., Russian, and Ukrainian delegations. The talks will 
continue until January 8. The participants are discussing 
details of an agreement specifying the main aspects of nuclear 
disarmament, which is likely to be signed on January 14. 
  In an interview with Interfax, Ukrainian Vice Premier 
Valeriy 
Shmarov, who is in charge of the military-industrial complex, 
expressed hope that "during the talks with the U.S. and Russia 
we shall pass over to initialing specific documents," above all 
the agreement to be signed by the three presidents. 
  He pointed out that this document would enumerate guarantees 
given to Ukraine and specify which material, technical, and 
economic assistance Ukraine will be provided with during nuclear 
disarmament.

  [Text] Kiev -- White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers 
has announced that the U.S. President will begin his "European" 
tour on 9 January. Bill Clinton will take part in a conference 
of NATO member countries' heads of state and government and from 
11 to 12 January will visit Prague where he will hold 
negotiations with Polish, Hungarian, Slovak, and Czech leaders. 
At Boris Yeltsin's invitation, the American President will make 
a three-day official visit to Moscow to "consolidate the 
democratic partnership between the United States and Russia," it 
officially reported. To conclude his tour, Clinton will visit 
Minsk. 
  Ukraine will not be visited by the head of the White House. 
However, INTERFAX reported on 3 January that a visit by L. 
Kravchuk to Moscow for trilateral negotiations has not been 
ruled out and that the Ukrainian president has been invited to 
do so in a recent letter from Clinton. The president's 
international service has informed a UNIAN correspondent that 
Nursultan Nazarbayev will make an official visit to Ukraine 
during Clinton's stay in Moscow. As for the letter, there is, 
indeed, an invitation in it to a trilateral meeting, but in 
Washington rather than in Moscow. It is not certain, THE 
WASHINGTON POST on 3 January quoted a high-ranking 
representative of the administration as saying, that the 
American and Ukrainian presidents will meet in Moscow; experts 
think that this will depend on the results of the U.S.-Ukrainian 
nuclear talks with the participation of the Russian side, which 
started in Washington on 3 January. Ukraine is represented 
there by Vice Premier V. Shmarov and Deputy Foreign Minister B. 
Tarasyuk. 
  Viktor Stelmakh, press secretary to the Ukrainian president, 
informed a UNIAN correspondent on 4 January that he could 
neither confirm nor deny reports of a forthcoming meeting 
between Kravchuk and Clinton in Moscow, since "there has been no 
final decision yet."

  [Text] According to reports by the mass media abroad, 
U.S.-Russian talks are now being held in Washington (?pending) 
the meeting of the Presidents of the United States and the 
Russian Federation in Moscow. Is it a fact that, as asserted by 
these mass media, a Ukrainian delegation is also taking part in 
the talks in Washington? Will Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk participate in the Moscow summit? 
  Our correspondent asked the chief of the Ukrainian Foreign 
Affairs Ministry's Information Directorate, Yuriy Serheyev, to 
comment on these reports. 
  [Begin Serheyev recording] A delegation of Ukraine, led by 
Mr. Shmarov, is indeed in Washington, where the topics of 
consultations are the same old topics, i.e. the questions of 
balancing our mutual relations with the United States and having 
them concentrate on the sphere of the economy, rather than just 
on military and political negotiations and military and 
political cooperation -- this is a topic known to you and is 
also one of the principal aims of our delegations and the task 
that it is faced with, and of course continuing the 
consultations, that have been in progress for a long time and 
were stepped up in December, precisely on nuclear arms 
elimination issues [sentence as heard]. So this topic is 
well-known, the consultations are going on, and so far we cannot 
add anything new. The delegation will return and perhaps 
something new will be added which might be described as a 
working version which could then be tabled before higher-level 
delegations. 
  As for the report that you quote as saying that a meeting in 
Moscow is possible, circulated by INTERFAX and some other 
agencies, there is indeed a certain mutual relationship between 
facts, events, and necessity. When presidents or high-ranking 
statesmen meet to talk, they have to have documents tabled 
before them to be looked at and signed by them. Up till now, we 
have only said that consultations and negotiations to work out 
possible documents are under way. I do not know what is the 
source of information about the possibility of such a meeting. 
What I do know is that a document has to be prepared to be 
considered at any meeting between presidents and any meeting 
between prime ministers. So it may yet be premature to talk 
about such documents having already been made ready now for the 
dates cited by INTERFAX, which are 14-15 January. At least, our 
delegation has to return from the United States, possibly for 
Mr. Shmarov and possibly for the Foreign Affairs Ministry and 
the president's administration to be asked that question. 
Perhaps this would provide a more logical situation for comment 
on a future meeting. 
  What everything rests on is that nobody has sought and 
worked 
for a meeting for the sake of a meeting although, you know, much 
speculation has been made on this: In the past, whether Kuchma 
would or would not be allowed in the United States, and now, 
whether there would or would not be a meeting with the President 
of the United States. All this, as it were, is emotional. The 
main thing and the main topic, however, and the main answer will 
be where common interests and common, compromise decisions will 
be found. Then, perhaps, what you intended to say in your 
question will be implemented. Perhaps, this is how it is. 
  That is why, I am not in possession of any information that 
I 
can provide you with, for me unequivocally either to confirm or 
deny the possibility of such a meeting. However, what I can do 
is to comment on this in this way, since the consultations and 
talks are still in progress. [end recording]

  [Text] Kiev, 4 Jan -- The participation of the delegation 
of Ukraine in the work of the 48th session of the UN General 
Assembly was one of the main issues covered at a regular 
briefing in the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry. Viktor Batyuk, 
Ukraine's permanent representative to the United Nations, 
informed those present that Ukrainian representatives have 
explained Ukraine's stance on nuclear disarmament issues, 
economic reforms, and accession to the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty. Work on drawing up an international convention on the 
status and safety of UN personnel, which was started at 
Ukraine's initiative, has contributed to Ukraine's growing 
prestige at the United Nations. One of the major results of the 
delegation's work was that a decision was taken by the session 
to revise in 1994 the system of payments made by Ukraine in 
respect of peacekeeping operations, with the repayment of its 
debts being postponed, and to make changes in the methodology of 
the construction of the scale of contributions to the UN regular 
budget. Changing the methodology may result in considerably 
reducing the size of Ukraine's contribution in the years 1995-97. 
  Nina Kovalska, a department chief, spoke about the course of 
the discussion at the 48th UN session on issues of the 
protection of human rights, social development, and humanitarian 
cooperation, held within the framework of the Vienna declaration 
and the action program adopted at the second world conference on 
human rights in June 1993. Following lengthy talks, in 
particular, the resolution on helping refugees and displaced 
persons in Azerbaijan was adopted. Ukraine was a co-sponsor of 
the resolution. The Ukrainian delegation spoke in favor of the 
Security Council expanding and of adapting its structure and 
activity to the requirements of modern international life. The 
discussion resulted in adopting a resolution on forming a 
special working group which would aim to process proposals from 
every interested state.

  [Text] Kiev -- At a briefing for journalists in the Foreign 
Ministry on 4 January, Viktor Batyuk, the permanent 
representative of Ukraine to the United Nations, summed up the 
results of the work of the Ukrainian delegation at the 48th 
Session of the UN General Assembly. He emphasized that since 
the radical change in Ukraine's political tack in respect of 
nuclear weapons and the Black Sea Fleet at the meeting between 
the Ukrainian and Russian presidents in Massandra on 3 
September, "less attention has been paid" to Ukraine at the 
United Nations. Viktor Batyuk characterized mutual relations 
with Russia as "a pendulum situation" and stressed that the 
Russian mass media "are defaming Ukraine." 
  The Ukraine representative said that members of the 
Ukrainian 
delegation made over 50 speeches in the course of the session, 
Ukraine co-sponsored 39 resolutions and was re-elected for three 
years as a member of the Committee for Program and Coordination. 
In Viktor Batyuk's words, Ukraine spoke against allowing any 
country's claim to be granted peace-making powers in any given 
region and demanded that peace-making actions should be carried 
out in accordance with the CSCE Charter and the major UN 
documents. 
  Viktor Batyuk confirmed that he has been appointed Ukraine's 
ambassador to Canada and that he will leave for Ottawa at the 
end of this week.

<F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Valentin Vernodubenko for TASS] </F>
  [Text] Kiev January 4 TASS -- A Ukrainian Government 
meeting chaired by Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy 
discussed today the stabilization of basic industrial branches. 
The meeting was attended by government members and heads of 
ministries and departments of the mining and coke-chemical 
industries, metallurgy, power engineering and transport. 
  "The discussion was suggested by a recent meeting of the 
Cabinet of Ministers that dwelt on prices on energy carriers, 
primarily coal," Ukrainian Vice-Premier Vasiliy Yevtukhov told 
UKRINFORM. 
  "We have raised coal prices, which resulted in the increase 
of prices on sausage, milk and bread. It is clear as soon as 
coal prices are raised, coke prices immediately go up, which is 
followed by price increase on machine-building and agricultural 
products. 
  "Some meeting speakers noted we can raise fuel prices and 
keep those in metallurgy and power engineering on the same 
level. It is impossible since the production costs in these 
branches include coal spending. The meeting aimed to reach a 
parity of prices in the coal industry, metallurgy and power 
engineering and achieve mutual understanding without which it is 
impossible to overcome the economic crisis," he added.

<F P=106> [Report by V. Pronin, member of the Political Council of the </F>
Ukrainian Socialist Party: "The Congress of Socialists"] 
  [Text] The third congress of the Ukrainian Socialist Party 
[SPU] has taken place. The 494 delegates that represented the 
31,000-strong party force and 120,000 of its sympathizer from 
all Ukrainian oblasts and the Crimea listened to a report about 
activities of the SPU Political Council (by O. Bozhko) and a 
report of the revision commission (by O. Mishchenko). Central 
to the congress was the report "On the Party's Electoral 
Platform and Its Objectives" delivered by O. Moroz, head of the 
SPU Political Council. N. Vitrenko and O. Yushchyk presented 
reports on the platform ideology. 
  All those who presented reports as well as deputies who took 
the floor later rejected Rukh's propagandist suggestion, 
dutifully publicized by the mass media, holding communists who 
supposedly remain in power personally responsible for the 
catastrophic situation in Ukraine. Former CPSU activists 
crowding the leadership of all anti-communist parties -- Rukh 
among them -- proved plain renegades. By approving the 
Rukh-made program of building capitalism in Ukraine through 
privatization and liberalization and allying themselves with 
nationalistic patriots and criminal bourgeoise, which made 
fabulous fortunes on this, reduced Ukraine to its present 
condition. 
  They have no right to retain power and should surrender it 
to 
representatives of workers that were most affected by the 
unheard-of looting of Ukraine. 
  The delegates to the congress spoke for the reinstatement of 
soviets and the liquidation of presidential structures, and 
demanded that the All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets be called as 
soon as possible, that people's and workers' control be 
restored, and that a transition constitutional law be adopted 
instead of the proposed draft constitution. 
  Major emphasis was placed on the party's tactics and 
strategy 
on the eve of legislative elections. The congress reconfirmed 
that the SPU will approach the elections as an independent 
political force with its own program and candidates, which does 
not rule out the possibility of cooperation with like-minded 
public organizations of a social orientation. A declaration on 
this kind of cooperation was signed at the congress by 
representatives of the SPU, the Ukrainian Communist Party [KPU], 
and the Ukrainian Peasants' Party. 
  The congress approved the party's electoral campaign -- it 
will be published in the nearest issue of the TOVARYSH [Comrade] 
paper --- and adopted a resolution on the report by the 
Political Council and the Revision Commission. The decision by 
the SPU and other leftists parties to participate in the 
upcoming elections provides an opportunity to get out of the 
crisis by peaceful and legal means. The party's electoral slogan 
will be: "For Social Justice, Power of the People, Lawfulness, 
and People's Safety." 
  In an appeal to the Ukrainian people, the congress called on 
electors not to make the mistakes from the previous elections, 
when they allowed antisocial and antipeople forces sneak into 
the Supreme Council, which vastly used funds from their foreign 
sponsors. We have no right to make the same mistake. The SPU 
appeals for all electors to go to the voting stations. A low 
turnout would abet further pillaging of Ukraine. 
  The congress warned that an antipopular course of the 
Ukrainian leadership raises protests of workers that might turn 
into a social explosion. Coal miners, shipbuilders, defense 
industry workers, etc. are standing up to defend their 
interests. The SPU has repeatedly warned that the current 
course leads to catastrophe. Before it is too late, the SPU 
calls on the authorities to meet all demands of striking 
committees, including those urging resignation of the president 
and the government, and altering the course of reforms to the 
advantage of the majority of the people. 
  The congress elected O. Moroz chairman of the Political 
Council and O. Mishchenko head of the Revision Commission. 
  After the congress ended, the Political Council held a 
meeting where O. Bozhko, I. Musiyenko, and V. Romashchenko were 
elected its deputy chairmen, and the 15-strong Council's 
Presidium was established. 
  The congress was attended by P. Symonenko, first secretary 
of 
the KPU Central Committee; M. Brokiavicius, the Lithuanian 
Communist Party Central Committee; B. Bondarchuk, co-chairman of 
the Socialist Party of Russian Workers Central Committee; K. 
Nikolayev, deputy chairman of the SKP-CPSU [expansion unknown]; 
S. Dovhal, leader of the Ukrainian Peasants' Party; 
representatives of Belarusian Socialists, "Working Ukraine," the 
Ukrainian Communist Union, the Association of Working Women, 
"For the Future of Our Children," the Ukrainian Leninist 
Communist Youth Association, veteran and other organizations as 
well as V. Hranycharov, member of the Executive Committee of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party, and Cuban and North Korean 
ambassadors.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Rakhmaninov: "The Results of Russian </F>
Election May Be Repeated in Our Country"] 
  [Text] A meeting of supporters of the Ukrainian National 
Assembly [UNA] and the Ukrainian National Self Defense [UNSO], 
which was held at the Cinema House, has not become a significant 
event in Ukraine's political life. Everyone has already become 
used to gatherings of UNSO members. Nevertheless, compared to 
other activities of Korchynskyy and company, the meeting was 
unusual. First of all, the most meritorious participants of the 
battles in Caucasus received official awards from Georgia. 
Secondly, the meeting at the Cinema House was held following a 
two-day congress of Slavic national patriotic organizations, 
which had been held at the Moscow Hotel at the initiative of UNA 
and UNSO. 
  Journalists who arrived on Saturday morning to admire Dmytro 
Korchynskyy and his followers were met by a cordon of militia 
officers: Law enforcement authorities had received an anonymous 
tip that a bomb had been planted in the Cinema House. Although 
they conducted a thorough search, no bomb was found. There were 
plenty of versions as to the reasons behind this threat: 
Somebody insisted that this was a communist provocation; others 
claimed that UNA members prepared the show to attract more 
attention to their organization. 
  Events that took place inside the building, when it was 
already clear that there was no danger of the grand assembly 
blowing up, also resembled a well-directed performance. The 
main goal of the meeting was to confirm the participants of 
their strength, and to impress those observing the meeting. 
Should one be scared of UNA and UNSO? Is it true that these 
two organizations (in fact the political and military subunits 
of one organization) represent serious power? I do not intend 
to assess the real importance or threat represented by 
Shukhevych's and Korchynskyy's organization, however, only a 
blind man would not notice its growing influence. The words 
voiced at the meeting may provoke a reflection of how the 
organization's image was enhanced. 
  "All other political organizations are losing members. Only 
we are growing stronger... The policy endorsed by the president 
and the government leads a manager of commercial bank, a miner, 
and a UNSO gunner to the same trench, and pretty soon they will 
be shooting in one direction." Although these two statements by 
Dmytro Korchynskyy had previously been delivered on two 
different occasions, their author took the risk of combining 
them, to demonstrate the principle of propagandist-psychological 
activities of UNA ideologists. The principle is as simple as 
mumbling, and it could be brilliantly carried into effect by 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the greatest populist of our times: The 
people should hear what they want to hear. The thesis about 
"fulfilling the reform movement with real sense" or "the weighed 
centrist-reform policy" would be met by the people with less 
understanding than simple postulates of UNSO: For the people -- 
a strong state; for the hungry -- a hunk of bread; for the 
traitor -- the gallows. This rings a bell, doesn't it? 
  The UNA and UNSO slogans, as well as the election promises 
of 
Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy], can be heard on bread lines 
and in smoking rooms. Liberal reasoning and discussions on 
serious matters are prohibited there -- the more 
straight-forward the statement, the better it is received. An 
illustrative example of UNSO's logic was presented by one of its 
members: "Earlier, our country resembled a zone where 
`legitimate crooks' were in power, now, it resembles a zone 
where bitches who violated the crooked law are in power. I do 
not want to be ruled by bitches, I am not a swine." Could you 
tell me who would admit being a swine? After such words, 
Korchynskyy's statement that "only UNA member live properly, the 
rest do not live at all" does not sound shocking. 
  The attractiveness of the Ukrainian Nazi lies in the fact 
that they have chosen those in power as their enemies, which is 
very appealing to the common man. Here are those guilty of all 
the misfortunes -- a bunch of thugs who are stealing away our 
state and teaching others how to do the same. It would not be 
so bad if UNA ideologists only exploited the centuries-old 
desire of the people to seek "extremes," but unfortunately such 
"extremes" occur pretty often, demonstrating political inertia 
and corrupting the people. Therefore, Korchynskyy's words about 
a miner and a UNSO member in the same trench are not simply 
bravado. 
  The guidelines of populist policy also provide for the 
necessary existence of myth. The inventive boys from UNA have 
constantly been refreshing the myth of their power and 
popularity, since the establishment of their organization. 
According to Korchynskyy, the Agro detachment that fought in 
Abkhazia is the best organized military unit. Following the 
same logic, UNA and UNSO are the best organized political forces 
in our country. The reasoning is very simple: UNA is the only 
organization which possesses experience in conducting politics 
in the situation of complete destabilization, meaning Cisdnestr 
and Abkhazia. According to UNSO theory, the time of talkative 
politicians has gone, and a time of "commanders with combat 
experience" is coming, since only such politicians are able to 
avert complete disaster, during a period when the people's wrath 
reaches its apogee, and one must save enemies of the people from 
that wrath as well as the country from complete ruin and 
possible occupation. 
  The myth of an apparently existing external threat is yet 
another example of UNSO's tricks. To root the myth in people's 
consciousness, and to simultaneously obtain certain support in 
case UNSO is banned (the 11 November legislation on illegal 
paramilitary organizations was predominantly aimed at UNSO), 
Korchynskyy, Luponis, Kovalenko and their comrades organized the 
congress at the Moscow Hotel. The idea of a united Slavic 
territory, which was discussed by national-Slavs from Ukraine, 
Russia, Belarus, and Poland, can hardly be carried into effect. 
The discrepancies between, for example, Ukraine's Party of 
Slavic Unity and the Russian People's Social Party or the 
Belarusian Slavic Union Belaya Rus, are too significant. 
Nevertheless, the idea of Slavic unity developed by 
organizations with ultranationalistic image, will undoubtedly 
attract more followers. Probably, this was the main goal of the 
congress. 
  The only thing that could scare an average citizen, on whom 
the UNSO Goebbels count, is open fascism. "Today is that rare 
day when UNSO does not have to storm anything or beat anybody... 
Of course, we could chase them all into a corner, but we will 
soon need some scapegoats... The poor German neo-Nazis look 
toward Ukraine in hope that maybe salvation will come from 
there. It will surely come..." These words were delivered by 
one UNSO leader during the congress. They fall in line with the 
frantic hail of "Death for enemies!" and the stretched-out and 
raised right arms. Even the uniforms of certain UNSO members 
resembled those of Schtrasser and Rem [SS officers]. 
  The brown color seen between the red and black colors of 
UNSO 
may either attract or scare someone, as once the possibility to 
play a real war attracted some UNSO members. By the way, the 
Nazis were not always the most massive and influential force in 
Germany. In the beginning, their ideas shocked the people's 
consciousness, but soon all of Germany hailed the swastika. 
Western historians have been trying to explain the phenomenon 
of Hitler. Today, Russian politicians are trying to understand 
the phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy. 
  Seven people who wanted to play war in Caucasus will never 
come home. No orders, no assurances that "henceforth our 
organization will be like one family" will return those sons to 
their crying mothers and Ukraine, the interests of which, as the 
UNSO leadership assures, were defended by the gunmen in the 
Caucasus.

  [Text] Kiev, [no dateline as received] -- Vilen Semenyuk, 
minister of power engineering, stated on 4 January that as of 1 
January, reserves of fuel in Ukraine had fallen to an 
unprecedented level -- three million metric tons of coal and 150 
metric tons of fuel oil, which in fact is the emergency reserve. 
Although energy consumption declined by 7.8 percent in 1993 
compared with the previous year and even by 12.8 percent in 
industry, energy consumption by the population increased by 30 
percent. In addition, energy enterprises owe suppliers 4.1 
trillion karbovantsi. According to information from the State 
Committee for Atomic Energy, new nuclear fuel was not purchased 
in the second half of 1993 because of a shortage of funds and 
spent fuel was not transported to Russia. Available resources 
should be exhausted in six months time. 
  Plans of the Ukrainian power engineering sector for 1994 
include purchasing 26 billion cubic meters of gas, seven million 
metric tons of fuel oil and 32 metric metric tons of coal 
including 20 metric metric tons through direct agreements.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive Interview" with Parliament Speaker Stanislav </F>
Shushkevich by INTERFAX journalists in Minsk; date not given: 
From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature prepared by Andrey 
Pershin, and Andrey Petrovskiy] 
  [Text] On the eve of 1994 the speaker of the Belarusian 
Parliament Stanislav Shushkevich visited the Belarusian office 
of INTERFAX [IF] in Minsk and spoke with journalists. Below is 
his exclusive interview. 
  IF: What, do you think, is the main result of 1993? 
  Shushkevich: I believe it was the materialization of the 
idea to create the Commonwealth of Independent States, the idea 
which rules out the difficult option of secession. An example 
of this is Azerbaijan and Georgia joining the CIS. Now all 
republics except the Baltics are members of the Commonwealth. 
  Constantly improving approaches in relationships within the 
CIS, we, I hope, as early as 1994, will be able to solve painful 
economic problems which cause enormous difficulties, say, for 
Belarus. I hope member-states will reach mutual understanding 
in this respect and policy-makers will put the emphasis on 
strategy, not on minor tactical comforts or elevating certain 
political groups in different countries. 
  I believe that some aspects of economic relations run 
counter 
to the ideas and goals of the Commonwealth. Those aspects seem 
to have been originated by political tensions in some CIS 
countries. However, the situation is back to normal in most 
member-states, which brings hope that things will develop for 
the better. 
  IF: You mean the relationships between the CIS countries and 
Russia, don't you? You granted an interview to INTERFAX in 
which you proposed creating within the CIS a bloc of republics 
which would work out a common policy towards Russia. 
  Shushkevich: I am sure we must demonstrate to Russia, the 
country which has more weight economically and demographically 
than all the rest member-states together, that we have common 
difficultiess which we would not like to identify with Russian 
policies. The course pursued by certain Russian politicians is 
not necessarily that expected of true statesmen and thus fatal, 
I believe. Sometimes they make statements towards this or that 
CIS member which could be described as insulting to all the rest 
member-countries. 
  Once we have decided to build a community and want that all 
its member-countries respect the Russian speakers just as 
Russians are respected here in Belarus, let's act adequately! 
Because the protest against the outbursts of some Russian 
politicians may grow over into an anti-Russian policy. However, 
I emphasize, none of the CIS republics pursues an anti-Russian 
policy. 
  The principles of economic relations, first of all, in terms 
of Russian energy supplies, are the most important unresolved 
issue within the CIS framework. OPEC is a kind of community of 
oil-producing states. Inside the CIS, Russia plays the role of 
such a community because the republics are virtually unable to 
buy oil anywhere else. But do the OPEC countries determine 
different oil prices for its partners, say, France, Germany or 
Britain? No, they do not. Prices are the same for its own 
"customers". If there are any differences in prices, they are 
due to the unsatisfactory political conduct of individual 
countries. 
  In view of this I would like to emphasize: I flatly reject 
any concoctions about my alleged restraint or dislike of Russia. 
The idea was invented by narrow-minded politicians. 
Fortunately, these are not leading political figures in Russia. 
Take all my statements and interviews. You will find in them 
not a single negative hint towards the country. Those who 
accuse me of anti-Russian sentiments are guided by petty 
instincts, not by commonsense. 
  IF: What do you expect from the new year of 1994? 
  Shushkevich: The coming year must return to us the feeling 
of self-dignity. If the Supreme Soviet adopted by a majority of 
votes a statement, according to which instead of an all-Belarus 
referendum on trust in parliament and government early elections 
were promised to be held in March 1994, the pledge must be kept 
and a solution to this question must be found. But so far we 
have been in a deadlock, which, instead of being exploited by 
our best forces is regrettably being taken advantage of by other 
elements. 
  If something is overlooked by the constitution and 
legislation, people resort to action, but God forbid it comes to 
violence. So, the main thing for me in the new year is to hold 
new democratic elections. 
  IF: A presidential election, too? 
  Shushkevich: I am not against holding it even before 
parliamentary elections but only on a legitimate basis. For 
this reason, parliament should adopt a new election law and 
schedule new elections as soon as possible. 
  IF: As is known, signatures are being raised among 
lawmakers in support of a vote of confidence in the Supreme 
Soviet's Chairman at the next session of parliament? Are you 
not afraid of losing the post? 
  Shushkevich: I have never been afraid of that. Experienced 
in political struggle and invigorated by recent hospital 
treatment, I'm fully determined to counter any sinister scheme 
like that. 
  IF: Some legislators predict that the issue on your 
resignation will be raised during parliamentary debates on the 
ratification of the CIS Charter, one of the major sections of 
which commits CIS participant-states to collective security ... 
  Shushkevich: Not long ago, Prime Minister Vyacheslav 
Kebich quite tactfully declared in the press that CIS countries 
did not regard Belarus as a member of the Commonwealth security 
system. Most signatories disagree with that republic's "special 
status," conditioned by a number of reservations on which 
Belarus would accept collective security (for one thing, 
reservations rule out Belarusian troops' involvement in fighting 
outside the republic - IF). I've kept on repeating that the 
collective-security system participants will never admit Belarus 
on special terms. So, what could happen? If in line with the 
reservations, endorsed by our parliament, there were an area of 
trouble in a neighboring country, Belarus would not send a 
peace-keeping force there. However, if we faced troubles, all 
CIS countries would, for some reason, be obliged to help us. 
But that's not collective security but an attempt to profit by 
the collective security system being formed nearby. 
  All the hullabaloo on whether I've signed the collective 
security accord or not has been contrived by "a narrow circle of 
persons," alleging that I am against collective security at all. 
Nonsense. I am only against obscurantism in collective in 
security. I am positively against collective security attempts 
at others expanse. 
  I am convinced that a state can be secured by totally new 
approaches to be based on the principle of neutrality, 
proclaimed by the Belarusian Parliament as harmless for anyone's 
interests. 
  If we want to be part of the CIS collective security system, 
and that is only for the Supreme Soviet to decide, we should 
realize that our sons, in such a case, would be up for draft at 
any volatile spot across the Commonwealth from the Kuril islands 
to Brest, from Franz Joseph Land to Kushka. 
  But since Belarus has not been involved in a single conflict 
in CIS, I do not realize why Belarusian men have to be involved. 
That's illogical. For this reason, I have always been an 
advocate of neutrality for Belarus. To fulfil the parliament's 
will, I signed a collective security treaty with the 
reservations determined by the national legislature. 
  (Stanislav Shushkevich signed the original of the CIS 
Collective Security Treaty on December 31, 1993, "to avoid 
dubious interpretation" of the form of signing the accord - IF). 
  IF: Does this mean that Belarus will stay away from peace 
actions of the UN and other international organizations? Do you 
plan to respond to the UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's 
request to dispatch a battalion of Belarusian troops to back up 
the international force deployed there to settle the Balkan 
conflict? 
  Shushkevich: I've had a discussion on that with Lord Owen 
and other representatives of Butrus-Ghali. Although the Supreme 
Soviet realized how essential it was for Belarus to take part in 
international actions on settling armed conflicts, it felt 
scared even to debate the issue because of "an acute Afghan 
syndrome" in the republic. Belarus suffered heavy casualties 
during the USSR crusade in Afghanistan. 
  There is yet another reason: The never-ending painful 
memories of the second world war, which claimed the life of 
every fourth citizen of the republic. No other CIS country lost 
so many lives during the war. I told Lord Owen: Give us a 
respite.

  [Text] A RID correspondent has received this sensational 
information from CIS Executive Secretary Ivan Korotchenya: On 
New Year's eve Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman Stanislav 
Shushkevich officially notified the CIS Executive Secretariat 
about Belarus joining the CIS collective security treaty, signed 
at the CIS heads of state conference in Tashkent on 15 May 1992. 
Thus, Stanislav Shushkevich made a difficult step, because he 
had categorically opposed joining the treaty. The official 
notification of the CIS Headquarters was probably prompted by 
statements made by CIS officials demanding that Belarus 
precisely determine its standpoint with regard to the collective 
security issue. With this step Stanislav Shushkevich removed 
the trump card of his opponents periodically pressing for his 
resignation from the post of Supreme Soviet chairman. 
  However, the speaker believes that the Belarusian 
legislature 
has a right to introduce amendments in the process of 
ratification, regulating both the use of the Belarusian Armed 
Forces on CIS territory and the CIS Armed Forces on the 
territory of Belarus.

  [Text] Chairman of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet Stanislav 
Shushkevich believes that confirmation of the idea to create the 
CIS, thanks to which the "hard" variant of former Soviet 
republics' division was excluded, was the major outcome of 1993. 
  In his exclusive interview with INTERFAX he underlined that 
the joining of new members, Azerbaijan and Georgia, confirms 
this fact. 
  Shushkevich hopes that in 1994 politicians will pay major 
attention to the strategy "but not to tactical conveniences and 
raising of definite political groups in different countries." 
  "If we decide to build the Commonwealth and want that the 
Russian-speaking population be respected in all its states, as 
it is in Belarus, then let us behave adequately! Any protest 
against separate moves of several Russian politicians can grow 
into an anti-Russian policy," declared Shushkevich. 
  He believes that principles of economic relations and 
primarily issues related to fuel and energy deliveries from 
Russia are the most important issues which have not been 
resolved yet. 
  At the same time, Shushkevich emphasized that those "who 
accuse him of anti-Russian moods" are guided by poor instincts 
and not by sound sense." 
  The head of the parliament awaits a new democratic 
parliament 
and, perhaps, presidential elections in 1994.

into the Republic of Belarus of Citizens of the Republic of 
Belarus" comes into effect on 1 January 1994. It lifts all 
restrictions on the issuance of a general civil foreign travel 
passport. In order to obtain it, one will not have to produce 
private or service invitations at local visa and registration 
departments. A written application will be sufficient, and a 
passport will be issued in due course. Moreover, there will be 
no need in the new year for a separate permission entry [in the 
passport] stating the country and the time limits for going 
there. The new passport will be valid to go to any country in 
the world a number of times. This was the topic of a news 
conference held in Minsk with the participation of 
representatives of the Foreign Affairs Ministry Consular 
Directorate, the Internal Affairs Ministry Passport and Visa 
Service, and the republic's Border Troops Chief Directorate.

<F P=106> [Article by Alyaksandr Loyka: "Russia Opposes Deepening of </F>
NATO's Influence Over Eastern Europe"] 
  [Text] Lately, the states of Central and East Europe have 
attracted the attention of West Europe and Russia. NATO is 
eager to have member states on the border with Russia, to 
strengthen the market potential of former Warsaw Pact states. 
Russia, in its turn, is doing everything to prevent NATO 
intrusion into East Europe because, in its viewpoint, this 
military union represents a threat to Russia's geopolitical 
interests. 
  Meanwhile, there are few officials in Russia who take into 
consideration the viewpoint of East European states. Some of 
them view NATO as a guarantor of their national security 
(Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary). Those states which are 
closer to Russia made attempts to create something akin to a 
third Europe. The existence of the Republic of Poland is an 
historic example of such a political structure in Europe. In 
the 18th century, this type of state did not meet the 
expectations of its population because it could not withstand 
the expansion of East and West, and was divided by them 
according to their spheres of influence. Lack of economic 
initiative, political anarchy, and Poland's eagerness to become 
rich at the expense of Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine were the 
reasons for the collapse of the Republic. 
  The establishment a Central European market stretching from 
the Baltic to the Black Sea is, simply put, highly unlikely due 
to the fact that both Russia and Germany will oppose this idea. 
Furthermore, the existence of this structure will mean the 
division of Europe into three military-economic blocks and the 
breaking up of the existing market relations. In my mind, the 
NATO proposal on the participation of East European states in 
the European integration process seems more likely. Following 
such a course, these states could secure access to Western 
capital and technology. 
  In Belarus, the last variant of the development of events in 
Europe is not supported at all. The opposition, represented 
primarily by the Belarusian Popular Front, is striving to 
implement its idea of setting up a Baltic-Black Sea Association, 
a kind of politically neutral buffer zone between NATO and 
Russia. This military-political draft project has an historic 
background. The Belarusian nomenclature, as represented by the 
Kebich government, is striving to establish a close union with 
Russia based on a joint monetary system. In fact, in Belarus, 
we are witnessing a struggle being launched in the financial 
sector. Currently, two monetary units -- the dollar and ruble 
-- are reigning supreme in the Belarusian market. Dollars 
symbolize Western trends, while rubles -- the Russian 
tendencies. Our Belarusian "hares" [nickname for Belarusian 
currency notes] are struggling for independence under conditions 
that are extremely unfavorable for the existence of capital and 
is gradually losing the game because the capital is located 
somewhere else, not in Belarus. 
  The latest events in the Supreme Soviet have shown that even 
though Vyacheslav Kebich defeated the opposition, he could not 
beat the dollar. Belarus is likely to introduce its own 
national currency and enter the world market with its normal 
criteria of business relations. I regret that this idea is not 
supported by a political force, which could explain why Belarus 
is not going to use its neutral position for the division of 
Europe. The neutrality was imposed on the Republic by its 
specific geopolitical location. A similar notion of neutrality 
was used by Austria when it found itself between two Europes 
(the socialist and the capitalist one). Finland has also used a 
similar tactic. It is clear that the leaders of these countries 
understood quite well that the principle of regional security 
has not lost its significance in the 20th century. NATO cannot 
be dissolved because it guards the interests of democratic 
states. It is evident that these states require protection 
because the totalitarian regime of the former USSR has not yet 
passed away. This totalitarian system is manifested in the 
aggressive Islamic fundamentalism and Asian communism (North 
Korea). It is also manifested in local nationalist tendencies 
(Germany, Russia). Therefore, totalitarianism is both a state 
of mind and a military-political strategy. Russia could find a 
partner in NATO for waging harsh fights against Eastern 
totalitarianism, especially in Tajikistan. However, the Russian 
military is against this union. The egoism of a neighboring 
superpower will force Belarus to either give up or find its own 
path to a civilized world. 
  The acting Supreme Soviet is unable to resolve this issue 
because its majority adopts only those decisions which protect 
their interests. The Supreme Soviet opposition faction is too 
weak. Nevertheless, the political and economic processes 
continue to develop. In my opinion, the dollar will win the 
battle. 
  For Moscow officials and the Belarusian Supreme Soviet 
majority, it is a usual thing that local provincial interests 
are being settled in Moscow. Therefore, V. Kebich and S. 
Shushkevich are continually visiting Moscow. Meanwhile, Moscow 
is uttering threats against disobedient Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and 
Uzbekistan because they cannot stem the flow of Russians from 
their territories.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly </F>
Supports Early Elections"] 
  [Text] The Executive Committee of the Central Council of 
the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly [BSDH] has adopted a 
declaration regarding the report delivered at the recent Supreme 
Soviet session by members of the temporary committee for 
investigating the activities of commercial structures. 
  The declaration emphasizes that Deputy Lukashenka's report 
provides facts already known to the public. The accompanying 
report by S. Antonchik was more principled because it revealed 
the major causes of corruption -- the preservation of the old 
political system, an absence of economic reform, and chaos in 
the legislature. These factors provide favorable conditions for 
the ruling nomenklatura's embezzlements. 
  The BSDH Executive Committee believes that the three-day 
debate on the issue demonstrated that all echelons of power, 
from village soviets to the Supreme Soviet and from local 
executive committees to the Council of Ministers, are involved 
in corruption. 
  The Latin meaning of the word "corruption" is bribery, and 
it 
is no exaggeration to say that our officials are corrupt. This 
is the only explanation for the reign of crime, especially 
organized crime in the Republic. Officials and deputies bribed 
by dealers of the shadow economy cannot adopt appropriate laws 
and take practical measures to put an end to evil. On the 
contrary, they are interested in disorder and confusion, for 
this gives them a chance to grow rich at the expense of the 
people. 
  The data on corruption in all echelons of power force us to 
draw practical conclusions -- both the Supreme Soviet and the 
Council of Ministers should resign. The demands for a coalition 
government and for holding early elections, voiced by democratic 
parties and movements, remain as urgent as ever. 
  To ban people access to information on corruption in the 
organs of power, the Supreme Soviet majority made a decision to 
continue the session behind closed doors. The rest of the 
session turned into an ordinary row aimed at answering one 
question -- who stole more. 
  At the session, some deputies insisted that the Supreme 
Soviet rescind its resolution adopted in October 1992. At that 
time, disregarding the demand of 380,000 electors to hold a 
referendum, the Supreme Soviet promised to expeditiously adopt a 
new constitution and hold early elections in spring 1994. 
Clutching to their posts, the communist majority in the 
legislature is ready to annul this decision. 
  The closed session on 16 December was used for attacks on 
Stanislav Shushkevich and to voice further demands for his 
resignation. 
  The BSDH Executive Committee calls upon all Belarusian 
residents to demand early Supreme Soviet elections in spring 
1994 and support the initiative of strikers' committees to form 
a coalition government.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Kvasov, chief of the Russian </F>
Federation Government apparatus, by Ruslan Ignatyev "in a White 
House reception room"; date not given: "Russian Government 
Moves to White House. Yesterday the Russian Federation 
Government Moved from Staraya Ploshchad to the 
Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment Building. Today Work Has Begun in 
the New Residence"] 
  [Text] ...Trucks are driving up to the entrances of the 
White House regularly, according to a timetable. Boxes and paper 
sacks are being unloaded. These contain books, documents, 
office equipment, computers -- in a word, everything that is 
needed for work. And it is not only the loaders who are heaving 
the sacks about. It is unusual to see government apparatus 
staff, including high-ranking officials, in jeans and sweaters 
rather than ties. But moving is moving. 
  Following the latest batch of packages, I go up to the fifth 
floor, the "premier's" floor. Some people are moving tables, 
others are already working almost normally. After all, there is 
no time to waste making it habitable. That is why the move was 
scheduled for a holiday -- 3 January. 
  Something else is also unusual -- the complete absence of 
the 
1940's and 1950's style, which perhaps could not be transferred 
from the corridors of Staraya Ploshchad. Here the furniture 
provides a modern business style. With the possible exception 
of the premier's office, where the furniture is imitation 
antique -- refined and at the same time sturdy. By and large it 
is not without its splendor, which I believe the head of 
government of a great power can afford to indulge in. 
  The reception room is several times larger than the one on 
Staraya Ploshchad. This is not just for the representatives. 
There are tables and chairs for visitors. In the old building 
they had to wait in the corridor. 
  It was here that I met Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the 
Russian 
Federation Government apparatus. 
  [Ignatyev] Vladimir Petrovich, the mass media has reported 
that the Russian government is apparently not all that keen to 
move to the White House and that the Federal Assembly wants to 
get hold of the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet 
apartments for itself. But you are moving. 
  [Kvasov] Yes, the new parliament did appeal to the president 
about this. However, the president stated unequivocally that he 
would not change his decision. The point is that the Federal 
Assembly is not the successor of the former parliament (by the 
president's edict, the government is). This is a completely new 
state formation, and so its claims to the property, 
organizations, and publications of the former Russian Supreme 
Soviet are not legitimate. If you remember, back on 5 October 
of this year the president signed Edict No. 1586, which says: 
"The buildings at No. 2 Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment and No. 2 
Rochdelskaya Ulitsa in the city of Moscow city are designated 
the official residence of the Russian Federation Council of 
Ministers-Government." Incidentally, this complex was originally 
built for the RSFSR Council of Ministers. It provided for 
literally everything in respect of government activity. Today 
an enormous amount of work has been carried out to restore the 
buildings, and the necessary conditions have been created for 
the functioning of the new residence. So the Russian Government 
has had no doubts in connection with the move to 
Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment. 
  [Ignatyev] What has been done in the White House in the 
past three months? 
  [Kvasov] Following the well-known events, as you know, the 
complex suffered a great deal of damage. The builders were 
faced with a complex task: They had not only to carry out major 
repairs to the structure, they had to modernize it. The 
buildings were constructed a long time ago, so many 
communications systems had fallen into disrepair. Furthermore, 
the former Supreme Soviet had partially changed the internal 
layout. Many areas had been partitioned off and turned into 
tiny rooms. In a word, the entire complex had to be returned to 
its original form, as the architect conceived it, and the 
builders dealt with this very well. 
  [Ignatyev] Were there any changes made during the present 
reconstruction? 
  [Kvasov] First and foremost the ordinary windows and stained 
glass windows were replaced by sun protection glass. Because of 
poor ventilation it used to be very hot in the premises, 
particularly in the summer. A new air conditioning system has 
now been installed. All stories are equipped with state of the 
art fire extinguishing equipment. Extra telephone lines have 
been laid and the old ones have been repaired. Two large 
canteens have been built. These are on the sixth and seventh 
floors. Three snack bars have been opened. Several other 
eating areas are planned. The interiors have been completely 
renewed. The inside of the building has become smarter and more 
modern. 
  [Ignatyev] How did the builders manage to cope with such a 
large amount of work in such a short space of time? 
  [Kvasov] The restoration work went on day and night. Over 
5,000 people took part in it. These included 2,000 specialists 
representing two Turkish firms. First-class builders were 
employed. Not all of the work has been finished, however. The 
complex has been divided into two parts: The six-story building 
and the high-rise 20-story one. The first has already been 
fully commissioned, and the second will be finished within the 
next two weeks. At the moment 12 stories are in use. The 
others still have to be brought up to the mark, so to speak. 
  [Ignatyev] Has the government moved fully into the new 
building? 
  [Kvasov] No, the prime minister and all of his deputies have 
moved in first and foremost. The government services are also 
installed at the new address. But it only proved possible to 
locate some of the apparatus. Ten departments are still in 
their old locations at the moment. They will move gradually, as 
soon as the restoration work is completed. I think that the 
entire government apparatus will move to Krasnopresnenskaya 
Embankment in January. 
  [Ignatyev] Who has moved into the former speaker's office? 
  [Kvasov] We know that Khasbulatov resided in the office of 
the former RSFSR Council of Ministers chairman. All the 
government leaders worked in it in their time -- Vorotnikov, 
Silayev. Now Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin has now occupied 
it by right. 
  [Ignatyev] So where are the prime minister's apartments 
located? 
  [Kvasov] They are on the fifth floor. The government 
Presidium conference hall is there too. There are also several 
small halls for holding conferences and for meetings with all 
kinds of delegations and foreign visitors. The chairman's 
apparatus services are next to them. 
  [Ignatyev] Who has moved into Rutskoy's old office? 
  [Kvasov] An ordinary department. I would like to note that 
a number of government subdepartments have moved into the 
six-story building, while the main services are in the high-rise 
block. 
  [Ignatyev] Are any premises envisaged for the Russian 
president? 
  [Kvasov] Yes, on the third story of the 20-story block a 
complex has been set up for the Russian president and his 
services. This is vital so that the president can work in 
closer contact with the government. He frequently has to attend 
government sittings and resolve operational questions. 
  [Ignatyev] Are there any plans for a reduction in the 
government apparatus? 
  [Kvasov] It is planned that the apparatus will be reduced by 
20 percent. Certain ministries and subdepartments will be 
completely abolished. I cannot name them specifically at the 
moment. Work is going on in this sphere. But it can already be 
said for certain today that the departments which are obsolete 
in the present economic conditions will specifically be subject 
to reduction. 
  [Ignatyev] And the last question. Where will the Federal 
Assembly be located? 
  [Ignatyev] Evidently a special building will be erected for 
the new parliament. A piece of land will be designated and a 
competition for the best design will be announced. And the 
Federal Assembly will get its own complex within a few years. 
But for the time being it will work in the location already 
determined by the president's edict. 
  ...Overnight the communications workers connected the 
government and special communications telephones in the new 
official residence. The government has begun its work.

  [Text] Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin Tuesday 
[4 January] has had the first official meeting at the 
government's new residence at Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment 
(former White House) with Bishop of Istra Arseny, vicar of the 
Holy Patriarch, as well as with members of the Moscow Eparchy 
Council. The Bishop has consecrated the building where the 
Russian government will work from now on. 
  The Premier will work in the study formerly occupied by the 
former Russian prime minister, Ivan Silayev, and then Boris 
Yeltsin. The recent occupant of the study was the former speaker 
of the Russian Parliament, Ruslan Khasbulatov. 
  The Bishop of Istra blessed the activities of the premier 
and 
the government. Chernomyrdin has handed over to him two icons 
and added that over one thousand icons would be handed over to 
the Russian Orthodox Church later. 
  Taking part in the ceremony was the first Vice-Premier Oleg 
Soskovets who, together with other government members, moved to 
the new study in the building at Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment. 
  A spokesman for the Council of Ministers has told Interfax 
that the new government residence has an office for President 
Yeltsin. 
  The building on the Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment will have 
previous telephone numbers for the government hot line. The 
telephone numbers for the cabinet members will change due to the 
building's being switched to a new automatic telephone network. 
At Staraya Square, the telephone numbers began with 206. Now 
the first three figures will be 205.

  [Text] Moscow January 4 TASS -- The Central Electoral 
Commission is presently making arrangements for the upcoming 
move to the White House government building, the former 
parliamentary residence. 
  Although the election campaign is over, the Central 
Electoral 
Commission is going ahead with its work, election officials 
stressed at their meeting on Tuesday. The Commission is now 
preparing a report on the election financing and the use of 
funds by candidates and election blocs. Arrangements are being 
made for elections in Russia's six constituencies where the 
December 12 poll was declared invalid. 
  But the main task to be tackled by the Central Electoral 
Commission is related to the presidential decree on measures to 
improve Russia's electoral system, Commission Chairman Nikolay 
Ryabov stressed in an interview with TASS. This document 
providing for transformation of the commission for the 1993 
elections to the Federal Assembly into a standing Central 
Electoral Commission of the Russian Federation "does not allow 
us to relax", Ryabov noted. 
  While drafting a law on elections in coordination with the 
Justice Ministry, the Central Electoral Commission will take 
into consideration all remarks made by individual candidates and 
parties. It will also head a system of commissions to be set up 
for holding elections tol power bodies of all levels in Russia's 
regions.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Badayev report under "Moving In" rubric, with </F>
general headline: "Like a Thief in the Night, the Russian 
Government Is Moving Its Stuff Into the White House"] 
  [Excerpts] The Russian Federation Government moved from 
Staraya Ploshchad to the building on Krasnopresnenskaya 
Embankment yesterday. Work in the new residence has already 
begun. This was announced yesterday by Vladimir Kvasov, chief 
of the Russian Federation Government apparatus. 
  The first to move in, Vladimir Kvasov explained, was the 
prime minister and all of his deputies. Government services 
have also been located at the new address. But only part of the 
apparatus has been accommodated. Ruslan Khasbulatov's office 
has been occupied by Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Aleksandr 
Rutskoy's has been taken over by a general department. On the 
third level of the 20-story building a complex has been set up 
for the Russian president and his services. This is necessary so 
that the president could work in closer contact with the 
government. 
  Generally, there are plans to trim the government apparatus 
by 20 percent, Vladimir Kvasov said. Some ministries and 
subdivisions will be fully abolished. Today it can be said with 
certainty that subject to axing will be those departments that 
have outlived themselves in the present economic conditions. 
[passage omitted] 
  A department chief in the Russian Government, who declined 
to 
give his name, told POSTFACTUM that Gennadiy Burbulis, 
commenting on this event, categorically stated: "Just as they 
have moved in, so will they move out!" A former adviser to the 
Russian president, according to the official, said that in 
protest against the fact that the White House has not been 
turned over to the Duma the deputies will hold their first 
session out of doors. 
  The department chief also noted that as a result of the 
government's relocation the work of its apparatus will be 
paralyzed for at least half a month because there are not enough 
phones in the White House; there are also difficulties with 
government communication channels. All elevators operate well 
up to the sixth level, beyond which only some do. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Chugayev: "Government on The Move"] </F>
  [Text] One of the chief events that nearly all politicians 
in Russia were expecting on the eve of the new year happened 
practically at the height of the festivities. The decision who 
will be the occupant of the Russian White House appears finally 
to have been made: The prime minister's secretariat and other 
government offices have already started to move to the building 
of the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. 
  At the same time, we learn, the economic services of the 
president's administration are preparing to move into the 
premises that are being vacated in Staraya Square. 
  The plan that is taking shape, showing the locations of the 
country's supreme organs of authority, looks both familiar and 
symbolic. The government is increasing the distance between 
itself and the Kremlin, as if stressing thereby the trend toward 
autonomy. The familiar buildings in Staraya Square are being 
occupied by administrative structures whose official status is 
only very vaguely delineated in existing legislation but which, 
since the adoption of the Constitution, possess real power in 
the country, indeed the fullest power, including the potential 
to influence the government. 
  Essentially, the relocation of the federal authorities 
symbolizes the end of the creation of the new system of state 
government in Russia, predetermined by the adopted Constitution. 
A system of strong apparatus authority, in which not only all 
the executive structures are under the control of the 
president's administration. Suffice it to recall that 
approximately a month ago an administration of affairs was 
formed in the administration, and it has the right to dispose of 
federal property, including the buildings that house the federal 
legislative, executive, and judicial authorities. Judging by 
the recently published presidential edict on state service, the 
president's administration also decides the fate of all federal 
officials, not only government, but parliamentary and judicial 
as well. 
  Maybe this system will play a positive role at the present 
stage, in the situation connected with the results of the 
parliamentary elections. But there are too many fears that it 
could soon turn into a closed, self-sufficient system, intent 
only on remaining in power. In that event it is not 
particularly difficult to predict victory at future 
parliamentary and presidential elections for forces 
ideologically close to the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia] or the Communists. As a voters' protest against the 
recreation of an essentially administrative edict model, which 
was supposed to have been eliminated once and for all following 
August 1991. But the chief paradox, it seems, is that such a 
victory would suit the system. 
  Obviously, the delay in the long-awaited presidential edict 
on the reorganization of the Council of Ministers should be 
viewed in this light, in the light of the fact that the new 
program for the government's activities will be determined not 
by the election results but by the results of the referendum, 
not by the distribution of forces in parliament but by the 
distribution of forces in the President's Administration's 
apparatus. The objective need for a reshuffle in the government 
is brought about by the results of the parliamentary elections. 
But the final decision will presumably be made after the 
official cause of the defeat has been found. When it has been 
established that the elections were lost either because of a 
split in the government, or because of a badly organized 
election campaign, or because of the government's incorrect 
economic policy. Essentially, though, it can be said that there 
is a struggle between the leadership of the President's 
Administration and the head of the government for control over 
the Council of Ministers. 
  But since the forces in this struggle can be regarded as 
approximately equal, consequently one should not really expect 
any major changes in personnel in the Cabinet of Ministers. You 
can be sure that that the number of vice premiers' posts will be 
significantly reduced. Probably to two or three. Of course, it 
is too early to talk about personalities, but there are grounds 
for believing that the distribution of forces that existed 
before the elections will be retained on the whole. So there is 
no reason to believe that after the reshuffle the government's 
activities will change significantly or, equally, that its 
economic policy will change significantly. 
  As far as one can judge from available information, all 
cadre 
decisions relating to changes in the government are planned to 
be made before parliament starts work. Thus presenting the 
deputies with a fait accompli, as in the case of the federal 
budget for 1994. It is not difficult to imagine what 
parliament's reaction will be. Deprived of a building and 
deprived of the right of control over government and budget, 
parliament is already programed for the role of center of the 
opposition to the executive.

  [Text] Moscow January 4 TASS -- The Central Electoral 
Commission will soon hand over to the Federal Assembly (Russian 
Parliament) documentation on the election results to the 
Federation Council (Upper Chamber) and the State Duma (Lower 
Chamber): Final lists of deputies to the two chambers, their 
personal files as well as all financial accounts. This work 
should be completed by the end of the current week, member of 
the Central Electoral Commission andrey Beloborodov told 
ITAR-TASS on Tuesday. 
  He noted that the Central Electoral Commission treats with 
understanding those lawmakers who have not decided whether to be 
members of parliament or to hold their present government posts. 
  "We do not prod legislators, since we understand that there 
will be government reshuffling, and it may turn out that some 
parliamentarians who will give up their seats in parliament, 
will later lose their government jobs," he noted. 
  At the same time Beloborodov stressed that those lawmakers 
who have not decided this question as yet, should remember that 
"the Central Electoral Commission should know for sure who will 
work at the new parliament by the first joint sitting of the two 
chambers which is to be held in the Kremlin next week," he noted.

  [Text] Moscow January 4 TASS -- "One of the most difficult 
and sensitive problems is the election of leaders of the lower 
chamber of the Russian Parliament -- the Duma," said Viktor 
Sheynis, coordinator of the commission for drawing up the agenda 
and forming the Duma's working bodies. 
  According to Sheynis, the commission plans to propose three 
ways to elect the speaker and chairmen of the parliamentary 
committees and their deputies. Sheynis described the first way 
as "traditional". It envisages the consecutive election of the 
State Duma's speaker and his assistants, the election of 
committee chairmen and their deputies, and then the adoption of 
corresponding procedural rules. 
  "The second way," he noted, "is the so-called `minor 
package', when representatives of election alliances reach 
preliminary agreement on candidatures to the posts of Duma 
speaker and his assistants, who are to be elected 
simultaneously. In this case," Sheynis believes, "we get more 
leeway for manoeuvring in order to meet the interests of the 
majority of mps, if not all of them." 
  "The third way," Solovyev [name as received] stated, "is the 
'larger package.'" He believes it is the most difficult one, 
but if "this work is completed before the first session of the 
State Duma on the basis of an agreement among election 
alliances, the Duma will be able to get down quickly to 
legislative work."

  [Text] Moscow -- As has become known, shortly before the 
New Year a steering group was formed to set up yet another bloc, 
tentatively called Center. It is expected that the bloc will 
incorporate representatives of all parties and organizations 
which either did not contest the 12 December elections or failed 
to pass one of their stages. The parties affiliated with the 
New Russia bloc are an exception. In particular this bloc will 
apparently include the Russian Social Democratic Center, the 
Russia Revival Union, the SPT, the PT [previous two expansions 
unknown], the Russian Christian Democratic Movement, the 
Democratic Party Moscow branch, and others. The new bloc 
intends to contest elections to local power bodies.

  [Text] Moscow January 4 TASS -- "About one thousand Russian 
and foreign journalists will be accredited at the new Russian 
parliament," ITAR-TASS Was told by head of the Federal 
Assembly's Press Centre Valentina Lantseva. 
  "Realising that the ardent desire of journalists to cover 
the 
work of our parliament reflects the Russian society's interest 
in its proceedings, we are doing our best to create proper 
conditions for the press," she stressed, adding that "this task 
is far from easy so far". 
  The duty of the Russian parliament's press service "is to 
provide journalists, in keeping with the press law, with all the 
information they need". "The Press Centre has been provided with 
several rooms within the building of the former Council of 
Mutual Economic Assistance, where the State Duma will be housed, 
including the smaller conference hall, which will be switched on 
to the television and radio relaying systems," Lantseva said. 
"However, these premises will hardly be sufficient, especially 
for the work of news services," she added. 
  "The question of whether or not meetings of the parliament 
will be shown on TV and broadcast across the country, as it was 
the case with the former Supreme Soviet, is to be decided by the 
MPs themselves," Lantseva noted. The Press Centre is drawing up 
proposals for contacts with the "Ostankino" TV company and the 
Russian Television. Today, the press service, which consists of 
less than ten officials, is preparing equipment and other 
facilities for the future Press Centre. Accreditation cards 
have been ordered and will soon be received in Moscow. The 
Press Centre plans to issue a reference book, listing parliament 
members with their photographs and other information, including 
political likings and number of children, similar to the 
reference manual used in the German Bundestag. 
  "The question of premises for journalists at the Council of 
the Federation, the upper chamber of the Russian parliament has 
not been settled yet," Lantseva said. She said it could be 
raised only after the press building is transferred to the upper 
chamber of the Federal Assembly.

  [Text] The chairman of the Karelian Parliament and deputy 
to the Federal Assembly, Viktor Stepanov, has told INTERFAX that 
on January 9 or 10 he intends to initiate preliminary 
discussion, with part of his colleagues in the upper house, of 
his proposal not to elect the speaker of the Federation Council. 
  Stepanov has said he intends to propose at the first session 
of the Federation Council January 11 to elect instead an 
executive secretary, as well as three co-speakers, each from the 
republics, autonomies, territories and regions who would in 
turns chair the House sessions. Stepanov has said that such a 
structural framework will help to achieve real, not just 
declared, equality of all subjects of the Russian Federation. 
  Stepanov believes there is no such equality so far, because 
as distinct from the Russian republics, territories and regions 
do not have their own constitutions and their heads are still 
appointed by the president. 
  Stepanov said that as an MP he would like to abolish 
Unitarianism in the Russian Federation and provide genuine 
federalism, when the component parts in the state have equal 
rights as is the case in the United States, Switzerland, 
Germany, and some other countries.

  [Text] Moscow January 4 TASS -- The working group set up to 
work out an agenda of the first session of the Federation 
Council has completed its work, Russian First Vice-Prime 
Minister Vladimir Shumeyko said. 
  In an interview with journalists on Tuesday, Shumeyko said 
that the group has worked out a draft agenda which includes five 
points, namely: the electoral procedure and election of the 
chairman of the Federation Council, the upper house of Russia's 
new parliament, and his deputies, the approval of the list of 
committees of the upper house and their formation, the 
procedural regulations and life-support system. 
  Shumeyko added that most disputes were caused by 
disagreement 
among the group members over what should be discussed first: 
the procedural regulations or the elections. 
  Shumeyko pointed out that under the constitution there 
should 
be no joint sessions of the State Duma, the lower house of the 
Federal Assembly, and the Federation Council. However, Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin is likely to address both houses after 
which they will adjourn to seat separately. 
  As for the candidate to the post of the chairman of the 
Federation Council, Shumeyko said "it is too early to speak 
about that, at least until electoral procedures are defined." 
  He confirmed that the first session of the upper house will 
be held in the building of the former House of the Russian Press 
at Pushkinskaya Street 26. "By all standards this building suits 
perfectly for normal work of the upper house. The president's 
order should be fulfilled unswervingly," he said.

<F P=106> ["Parliamentary Diary" article by Vladimir Isakov: "Does </F>
Russia Need Deputies?"] 
  [Text] None The Wiser 
  It is snowing, sleeting edicts. Piling one on top of another 
and mixing together, they form something like the impenetrable 
porridge that fills Moscow's streets. 
  The edicts revoke or suspend laws and introduce new 
juridical 
norms instead; the edicts rip entire chunks out of the body of 
existing legislation. What about the new Constitution? No 
recollection of it. By error, apparently, Article 90 of the 
Constitution stated: "Edicts and directives of the Russian 
Federation president must not contradict the Russian Federation 
Constitution and federal laws." What? The president 
constrained by laws? We can't have that! But Edict No. 2270 of 
22 December 1993 clears up the "misunderstanding": "It is to be 
laid down that Russian Federation laws...do not apply when they 
contradict the present edict." Now that's better! 
  But even then the recent edict "On Measures To Bring Russian 
Federation Legislation Into Line With the Russian Federation 
Constitution" stands out like a sore thumb. I do not want to go 
on about the fact that "bringing legislation into line" is the 
job of the legislative branch, and not of the president at all. 
If there are people who have not yet realized that anything 
goes as far as the president is concerned, they are presumably 
about to be put right. But even in these conditions there are 
things that cause embarrassment, to put it mildly. 
  Top of the list is Yeltsin's cancelation of his own 21 
September 1993 Edict No. 1400 "On Stage-by-Stage Constitutional 
Reform in the Russian Federation." Yes indeed, the very edict 
that overthrew the Constitution, declared the dissolution of the 
Congress of People's Deputies and Supreme Soviet, and suspended 
the activities of the Constitutional Court. The edict, which 
caused an acute political crisis in the country, led to the 
firing on parliament and the enormous loss of life. 
  When he addressed the people, Yeltsin promised that the 
edict 
would be submitted for examination by the new parliament. He 
was entrusting the assessment of his actions to the new 
parliament, elected in the new conditions -- either to approve 
or to condemn them. Now he has reneged on his promise. The 
president has changed his mind. 
  There was an equally unceremonious edict on existing 
legislation. Amid all the "bringing into line" the government 
and the president are hastily getting rid of some of the legal 
norms that get in their way. The law "On Personal Privatization 
Accounts and Deposits," which fell foul of Chubays' voucher 
privatization, has been repealed. The law "On State Protection 
for the Supreme Representative Organs of Power" has been 
repealed, evidently as a sensible precaution for the future. 
Yeltsin also thought it was a convenient moment to dispense 
with the duty of presenting an annual report on state policy in 
the sphere of protection of citizens' health and the state of 
the Russian population's health. No wonder in the three years 
of his rule the health of the population has reached crisis 
point (figures and facts on this subject were cited in 
SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA recently). So what you have to do is close 
the subject to discussion! 
  A little further on yet another "minor masterpiece" of the 
"constitutional renaissance" era is eliminated -- the edict "On 
Legal Regulation During the Period of Stage-by-Stage 
Constitutional Reform in the Russian Federation." But hang on, 
wasn't this the very edict that served as the basis for the 
executive's massive incursion into the sphere of legislation, 
taxes, and the budget? Is it a case of "the Moor has done his 
job, the Moor may go"? 
  At the end of the edict, which casts a shroud of silence 
over the blood-spattered remnants of the legal system, we 
encounter the familiar phrase: "This edict is to be submitted 
to the Federal Assembly for it to examine..." What, more 
promises? Is there any limit to the hypocrisy? 
<H5>  Cult of Law or Cult of Force? </H5>
  When assessing the results of the president's and 
government's "fruitful activity" in the sphere of legislation, 
it is hard to avoid the feeling that an experienced hand is 
directing the breakup of the Russian state and legal system. 
  This breakup began three years ago, when the provision on 
Russian laws taking precedence over union laws was enshrined in 
the declaration on state sovereignty of the RSFSR, adopted by 
the Congress. The results had a rapid impact. Union 
enterprises soon began to be drawn into "Russian jurisdiction," 
and the Union government was put on "maintenance" -- a 
single-channel system of taxes. The article on Russian laws 
taking precedence was an excellent cover for a ruthless power 
struggle which resulted in the destruction of the single Union 
state. 
  Then came the decision to institute the post of president, 
which gave rise to confrontation between the authorities and a 
dangerous concentration of power in one pair of hands. Now we 
can see that the system of "democratic checks and balances," 
which is in an embryonic state, could not prevent the slide 
toward dictatorship. 
  The next stage in the breakup was the decision on extra 
powers, which entitled the president to adopt edicts which had 
the force of law. The two locomotives headed toward one another 
were bound to crash. And they did. The result was 
disintegration, instability, anomalies in legislation, and 
Russia's declining authority both as a business partner and as a 
state in which laws are respected. 
  The next step was the so-called "constitutional crisis," 
caused in fact by the president's reluctance to live and work in 
accordance with the Constitution under which he was elected and 
to which, incidentally, he swore loyalty in his presidential 
oath. Cries of "patched-up Constitution!" and "It is impossible 
to live by it!" disorientated a section of society, 
unfortunately. As a result, the old Constitution was destroyed 
while the new one...the new one is giving rise to more questions 
than it is answering. 
  Taking advantage of the events of 21 September-4 October, 
the 
president and his entourage effected the total breakup of 
representative authority from top to bottom. Tne Federal 
Treaty, which had been passed off as a most important guarantee 
of the country's unity and integrity in the new conditions, was 
removed from the Constitution. On the pretext of concern for 
local self-government its autonomy was effectively eliminated. 
  The facts indicate that Russia is being led toward the final 
phase of the breakup of the legal system. The old Constitution 
has been destroyed and the new one has been adopted with serious 
violations having taken place. Immediately after the 
Constitution was published it began to be discredited, and in 
various areas moreover. In the first place, it is discredited 
by the numerous examples of violation of the law during its 
adoption. Second, by the arrogant attitude toward it on the 
part of the president and the executive, which are as disdainful 
of the new Constitution as they were of the old one. Third, the 
Constititon is undermined by regions' legislative acts, which 
contradict it at every step. You have, for example, the 
constitutions of Tatarstan and Bashkortostan and the 
constitution of the Ural Republic, which was adopted but 
immediately rescinded. And you cannot really blame the 
republics: Before giving Chechnya, Tatarstan, or Bashkiria 
membership of the Russian Federation the consent of the members 
of the Federation should certainly be sought. And what do you 
have now: The old Constitution is no more, the new one has not 
been agreed with them and approval was not obtained in the 
referendum on their territory. A completely free hand! 
  In short, every effort has been made to ensure that in the 
event of an acute political crisis none of the sides can rely on 
the authority of the law, of the Constitution. To ensure that 
the sole authority on the territory of Russia is the Kalashnikov 
rifle and the special militia's stick. 
<H5>  The Stick and Presidential Rule </H5>
  A new contender appears to have joined the competition for 
the best political spectacle of the year -- the Federal Assembly 
session. The newly elected parliament has not yet started its 
work, but there is no end of gloomy forecasts and predictions: 
"They will split," "they will fight," "they will 
disintegrate".... Actually, there are grounds for the gloomy 
predictions: Indeed, Messrs. Sheynis, Bezrukov, and Mityukov 
are in charge of preparatios for the first sittings, and the 
other day they were joined by Mr. Filatov. 
  The mood of diappointment and pessimism is encouraged by 
the fact that the Federal Assembly has been in an absurd and 
humiliating position from the very outset. By an edict of the 
president it was deprived of its official home -- the House of 
Soviets on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment. All service 
components -- vehicle pool, accounting -- were cut back to the 
bone. Now you have to go to the president's office for every 
little thing. 
  The edict approved the Federal Assembly apparatus and 
appointed its leader, Mr. Podoprigora. The leaders of the 
apparatus are preparing for the opening of the first Federal 
Assembly session, but in a very peculiar way. Experienced 
staffers of the former Supreme Soviet are being swiftly 
dismissed and replaced by "certified cadres." For instance, a 
large part of the organizational department, which used to 
handle the practical preparations for sittings and maintained 
links with the regions, was eliminated. Dozens, hundreds of 
specialists have received dismissal notices. And this a few 
days before the session opens... 
  The draft Standing Orders of the State Duma and Federation 
Council are already being prepared in the bowels of the 
president's office. One constant desire can be discerned amid 
the pages and pages of documents, like the moon peeping through 
the clouds: To make the future parliament a talking shop rather 
than a working body. For example, monitoring functions have 
been removed completely from the standing orders: debate the 
laws by all means, but monitor their execution -- no way! 
Instead of a presidium a body called a "conference," implying 
no obligation for anyone, is being instituted -- in it the 
chairmen of factions (party structures) will each have several 
dozen votes, while the chairmen of committees (the structural 
components of parliament) will only have a voice but no vote. 
The purpose of these novelties is clear and simple -- to turn 
the future parliament into a political debating society. 
  The obvious intention is to create as many contradictions as 
possible within parliament and cause clashes between Federation 
Council deputies and State Duma deputies. The trigger for such 
a conflict is not just simple, but very simple: All you need to 
do is create a marked difference in salaries, living conditions, 
and transport and office premises and facilities provision, and 
emphasize your warm attitude toward one lot and cooler attitude 
toward the other.... Now the ground is prepared for growing the 
poisonous mushrooms of personal ambition and mutual discontent. 
The current authorities have a wealth of experience in this 
respect. Suffice it to say that the deputies representing the 
opposition are still unable to obtain the basics -- to get the 
telephones that were cut off during the election campaign 
reconnected. Let them go around begging and swearing. It is as 
easy as anything then to portray them as troublemakers concerned 
only with their own "deputies' privileges." 
  There is yet another problem that is arousing a great deal 
of 
emotion. It is the former USSR and Russian Federation people's 
deputies still living in official apartments. Some of them have 
settled in Moscow, others have simply nowhere else to go to. 
This brought on a fit of administrative rage: "You have 24 
hours to move out!" But this is precisely a case where 
administrative interference is harmful. If you throw onto the 
street people whose only crime was to carry out their civic duty 
and not seek handouts, we will not attract any deputies in the 
future. 
  The question is: Do we actually need deputies in Russia? 
Who wants to face the abuse and scorn of the press, feel 
impotent in the face of an official's disdainful smile, be held 
responsible for something you are unabler to change? Perhaps we 
should immediately place power in the hands of those who know 
how to make money out of it and no longer bother with 
competitive elections? 
  That is way things are going, it appears. The fuss over the 
work of the Federal Assembly before it has begun reveals a 
hidden goal, which is to discredit the very idea of people's 
representation in the people's eyes: No, they say, we are not 
mature enough for a parliament.... The stick and presidential 
rule -- that is what Russia needs.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gennadiy Kalistratov, acting coordinator of </F>
the newly created faction of independent deputies, by Sergey 
Brusin; place and date not given: "Gennadiy Kalistratov: Party 
Sword Hangs Over Duma"] 
  [Text] The State Duma has not even begun its work, but the 
lives of the deputies within it is already tense. The parties 
which collected the largest number of votes during the elections 
are forming factions, conducting publicized and unpublicized 
talks, elaborating scenarios, and sharing out power. The 
creation of a faction (or a group -- it is being given various 
names) of independent deputies elected in the regions in 
one-seat districts has come as a surprise event to many people. 
Our correspondent Sergey Brusin talked to Gennadiy Kalistratov, 
acting coordinator of this new deputies' association, who, as he 
stressed, expressed his own personal viewpoint. 
  [Brusin] Gennadiy Stepanovich, why has the association of 
regional independent deputies been formed? 
  [Kalistratov] The reason is simple; it has moral and civil 
roots. The main tasks facing all of society are to give 
economic reform a social orientation, to create a federative 
state in reality and not just on paper, to develop local 
government, to create the political conditions for fruitful work 
by the government, to combat crime, and to ensure the political 
and economic integration of the CIS countries.... Without them 
we will not achieve political stabilization in the country. 
  However, the way the State Duma has started work may turn 
out 
to be such that a solution to the aforesaid problems will not be 
brought nearer but, conversely, will be delayed. Such a turn of 
events is the potential outcome of employing a purely 
party-based principle in forming the Duma's working mechanisms. 
  That is why a special role has been given to the independent 
deputies, who have from the outset been outside the influence of 
Moscow (as we know, the parties mainly represent Moscow), 
outside party struggles, and outside party discipline. The 
independent deputies are responsible to the electorate and the 
electorate alone. By uniting to coordinate their actions on the 
basis of pragmatism and realism, they can stabilize the 
parliament's work. They will have to fight against both narrow 
party interests and the ambitions of individual deputies. 
  For instance, the parties will first and foremost try to use 
the rostrum and the opportunities presented by the Duma to 
prepare for the next elections. Private agreements between 
leading party factions are also possible, leading to scenarios 
whereby all of the deputies will be forced to vote for packages 
of proposals. Then the Duma's leading organs will be formed 
practically solely from the parties. Another scenario is also 
being elaborated: to offer to post of speaker to a faction 
representative from a small party, in order to put an end to 
arguments. This is a good intention as long as there is no 
hidden maneuver here to have the speaker pursue the line of a 
specific leading party later on. 
  The independent deputies should uphold temporary regulations 
which would enable people who are professionally trained to 
enter the leadership of the Duma -- people unconnected with 
party discipline. The speaker should not be an isolated figure 
(let us learn the lessons of the past). The number of his 
deputies should most probably not be equal to the number of 
leading parties, otherwise an exclusively party-based principle 
will prevail in the Duma's work. The formation of the Duma 
apparatus should also be seen from this angle. 
  The party principle in the division of the mechanisms of 
power is also a "minefield" because the party coalitions are not 
mature but were created in an ad hoc way and will scarcely 
withstand the tests of unity to which life itself will soon 
subject them. Processes of division and collapse within parties 
are inevitable. And the Duma, if formed on the basis of the 
party principle, will find itself drawn into them. Then, before 
we even have time to deal with Russia's problems, we will drown 
in behind the scenes squabbles. 
  It appears that, in this situation, only a strongly unified 
political center, organizing cooperation among all constructive 
forces, can preserve the Duma's viability.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Sheynis, deputy chairman of the </F>
President's Legislative Proposals Commission, by correspondent 
Lyubov Volodina; place and date not given: "The Rules of the 
Game for Deputies"] 
  [Text] The elaboration of the draft laws which will enable 
the Federal Assembly to carry out its activity is being 
completed by the President's Legislative Proposals Commission. 
Commission Deputy Chairman Viktor Sheynis here talks about them 
to your correspondent. 
  [Volodina] Viktor Leonidovich, why did the need arise to 
draw up the legislative organ's standing orders before the 
Federal Assembly starts work? After all, this was previously 
done by parliament itself. 
  [Sheynis] I regard this as a sensible decision because 
parliament cannot operate without standing orders or a law on 
the status of deputies. We cannot use the old standing orders 
and the old law because we have a parliament that is 
fundamentally different in terms of its organization, structure, 
method of election, and constitutional functions. Fundamentally 
new documents regulating its activity are correspondingly 
essential. The fact that we have gotten down to preparing these 
draft laws is sensible, in my view, because the questions of the 
actual organization of parliament's work must be resolved before 
we move on to substantive questions. Otherwise it is unclear 
how those substantive issues will be tackled. But our society 
is interested above all in the actual work of legislation, which 
is bound up with tackling the fundamental issues that concern 
our society and were so clearly manifest at the elections and in 
the referendum, rather than the manner in which deputies will 
conduct themselves, how voting will be carried out or the 
chairman elected, or how many committees the State Duma and 
Federation Council will set up. Therefore the preparatory work, 
which is being carried out in a sufficiently expert manner and 
which in no way predetermines the final versions which the State 
Duma and Federation Council will adopt, will simply save time 
and enable us to cover more quickly the ground which is 
preparatory in nature and get down to the main business for 
which the new parliament was elected. 
  [Volodina] You do not anticipate that the State Duma and 
Federation Council will refuse to accept the proposed drafts on 
the grounds that they have been drawn up by the president's 
commission, that is to say, by the executive branch, and embark 
on their own work? From scratch.... 
  [Sheynis] Theoretically that is feasible, of course. 
Practically, however, it seems to me that sensible people, the 
people elected as members of parliament, will not be able to 
dispense with the work which has already been done and which 
will, I hope, satisfy them to a considerable extent. But two 
provisos have to be made here. The first is that groups of 
deputies have already been set up to prepare the sessions of the 
future parliament, and the Legislative Proposals Commission's 
draft outlines will be submitted for their examination. It is 
highly likely that they will make their own contribution to this 
work in the time remaining before 11 January. Thus the 
documents will to some extent be approved by deputies of the 
present convocation. As for the second proviso, I think that the 
introduction of certain emendations to the drafts is not only 
possible but also extremely desirable. A number of serious 
conceptual disagreements have arisen in the process of working 
on them. I, in particular, as a participant in this work on the 
one hand and as a deputy of the State Duma of the present 
convocation on the other, have a whole series of serious 
objections to the text which now exists and will do all in my 
power to make the necessary amendments to it. 
  [Volodina] What is the nub of those disagreements? 
  [Sheynis] The standing orders and the status of deputies 
touch above all on the question of whether deputies will have an 
obligatory or free mandate. In other words, can a deputy 
elected, say, on the federation-wide list be stripped of his 
status as a deputy on the basis of a decision by the electoral 
association which entered his name on the list? There are 
differing approaches here: Both sides have their arguments for 
and against. The second point is: Can a deputy quit one 
faction and join another? How strict and tough are the 
conditions governing a deputy's involvement in a faction's 
activity? I consider that the very division of the legislative 
organ on the basis of political positions rather than according 
to regions, as used to be the case, marks a huge step toward a 
civilized parliament. But I do think that binding every deputy 
to a particular faction in an extremely strict manner will 
undermine the activity of the factions as groups of political 
associations of deputies among themselves and create unnecessary 
inner tension within factions. 
  Moreover, the very serious problem arises not just of the 
relationship between a deputy and his faction but also of the 
relationship between a deputy and a committee and a deputy and 
the organs which provide services to the State Duma and the 
Federation Council. There clearly exists a common opinion, one 
reflected in the the drafts, that we should in no circumstance 
have a sovereign presidium or a "speaker of all Russia," who is 
an independent figure and issues directives which are mandatory 
for parliament and binding on deputies. Decisions in parliament 
should, in keeping with the very raison d'etre of that organ, be 
made on a collegial basis. As far as the chairman, deputy 
chairmen, and committee chairmen are concerned, they exercise 
purely organizational and coordinating functions. Here there is 
clearly a wide degree of agreement, although it does seem to me 
that certain statutes must also be amended here to ensure the 
individiual deputy's sovereignty. 
  [Volodina] Won't the election of some deputies on a 
proportional system and correspondingly their more rigid 
attachment to factions than before tend to intensify political 
struggle inside the State Duma rather than weaken it, as 
relatively strong and internally disciplined groups will be 
counterposed? 
  [Sheynis] I think it essential to enshrine in both the 
status of the deputy and in the standing orders the fact that a 
deputy is free to express his own opinions. A faction is 
entitled to dispense with a deputy's services and exclude him 
from its ranks, and a deputy then loses all the additional 
opportunities which he obtains from affiliation to a faction. 
He will thus think long and hard before deciding to take the 
extreme measure of severing his connection with the faction. I 
think it correct to enshrine in the standing orders (there is 
nothing on that score in the draft to date) that a faction can 
expel a deputy, although this should not be done lightly: The 
procedure pertaining to such a decision should be strictly 
stipulated. Likewise a deputy is entitled to withdraw from a 
faction of his own accord. A faction should have the right to 
accept other deputies into its ranks, including those elected 
for single-seat electoral districts. I think that this will 
alleviate tension inside a faction to a certain extent. But the 
movement toward a party political organization of parliament 
marks in itself, in my view, a considerable step forward, one 
prompted by our election law. Today certain imperfections and 
failings in the election legislation are apparent -- this was 
our first effort, after all. But its merit resides precisely in 
the fact that a definite political structure has replaced 
disorganized deputies and more or less haphazard decisionmaking, 
decisions which could be made either under the influence of a 
volatile mood or as a result, say, of manipulation by the 
speaker, and so forth. Real social contradictions will not 
disappear; they exist. Political struggle will go on. The 
problem is not to exclude struggle but to channel it within the 
normal civilized norms accepted throughout the world. And, as I 
see it, faction-based organization helps rather than hinders 
this cause. 
  [Volodina] Will the Legislative Proposals Commission cease 
to exist with the start of the parliament's work, or will it 
remain? 
  [Sheynis] The President's Legislative Proposals Commission 
was set up by the president. The decision will consequently be 
made by him. From my own standpoint, the existence of such a 
commission is useful. It is useful insofar as a significant 
amount of legislation is submitted on the president's behalf. 
That is world practice too: The executive branch in the person 
of the government or the president introduces 70 to 90 percent 
of all draft laws. To ensure that they are worked on to a high 
standard I think it useful to have such a structure in the 
Presidential Administration. It is another issue that this 
structure, if it is retained -- I repeat, I do not know what 
decision the president will make -- should, of course, be 
somewhat restructured, if only because a considerable number of 
the commission personnel, elected deputies, will go into the 
Federal Assembly. That is the provision of the law, and I 
myself have already tendered my resignation as deputy chairman 
of the commission, as prescribed by law. But I do think that a 
sufficient number of skilled people who acquired experience in 
legislative work in the last parliament will remain in the 
commission, and it would be wasteful and uneconomical, given our 
situation, to dispense with those people and the activity which 
they can successfully undertake. Therefore, if I were the 
person deciding the question, I would keep the commission in a 
transformed guise.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Yanchenkov: "Parliament Apparatus Ready </F>
for Work"] 
  [Text] That is what Vladimir Podoprigora, leader of the 
Russian Federal Assembly apparatus, stated on the eve of the 
opening of the first State Duma session. 
  In contrast to the apparatus of the former Russian Supreme 
Soviet, which numbered 1,350 people, he noted, the new 
parliament's apparatus will consist of 537 employees. Since the 
Russian Federal Assembly consists of two independent chambers 
(the Federation Council and the State Duma) there will 
correspondingly be two secretariats in the apparatus. 
  A workable nucleus has been formed. The first experience of 
work with the deputies' commissions created by the chambers has 
shown that the parliamentary apparatus workers can fully cope 
with the set tasks. 
  The testing which has been carried out on the staffers has 
confirmed their high level of professional training. That is 
understandable, for 90 percent of the apparatus workers are 
employees of the former Supreme Soviet. These people have 
resolved and are capable of resolving tasks of any complexity. 
What tasks will be set them, and by whom, is another question. 
  The main task of the Russian parliamentary apparatus is to 
ensure the effect work of the deputies, to supply them with the 
necessary information in an entirely complete and objective 
manner, and to promote the high-quality formulation of the 
decisions the deputies will make. And they must do everything 
to ensure that they exert no influence in any way on the nature 
of the decisions which are made or on their content.

<F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Factions" rubric: "Duma </F>
Debates: Winner To Be Named by Zhirinovskiy? `Big Four' Unable 
To Reach Agreement"] 
  [Text] Strange as it may seem, the parliamentary debates 
scheduled to begin on 11 January may turn out to be very 
predictable. A parliamentary mechanism hitherto unheard of in 
Russia -- decisionmaking by consultations among key faction 
leaders -- is taking shape at the State Duma. The very first 
three weeks after the elections have enriched Russia's political 
vocabulary with the term "The Big Four." The four largest 
factions -- the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], RFCP 
[Russian Federation Communist Party], the Agrarian Party, and 
"Russia's Choice" -- as expected, will continue to mold the 
parliament's policy. 
  "Small" factions, to all appearances, will be unable to 
pursue their own line and will give their backing to one of the 
"Group of Four" members. At the same time, the votes of these 
backers will be split approximately equally between the two 
irreconcilable foes -- the bloc of the communists and agrarians 
on one hand and "Russia's Choice" on the other. 
  Neither the Democratic Party of Russia [DPR], nor "Women of 
Russia," nor "Yabloko" have so far entered the consultations, 
PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] leader Sergey Shakhray 
being the only one displeased with the fact that "the four large 
factions have usurped the rights of the other deputies." 
  The round of talks on the candidacy of the speaker to which 
representatives of "small factions" were invited has shown, 
however, that an increase in participants does not affect the 
outcome of the consultations. Mr. Shakhray's "dissenting 
opinion" appears to have been prompted by the decision of the 
"Group of Four" that chairmanship be given only to a deputy from 
a "large faction." The PRUA leader, however, lays claims to the 
office himself. 
  The first consultations devoted to the election of the State 
Duma speaker have shown that the standoff between the communists 
and "Russia's Choice" rules out any agreement within the "Group 
of Four" and thus gives Zhirinovskiy's party unlimited room for 
maneuver. This is why the LDPR's stance on key matters the 
parliament plans to considers is becoming crucial. 
  To all appearances, the LDPR has decided to give its backing 
at the vote to elect a speaker to Ivan Rybkin, a candidate from 
the Agrarian Party. It seems that in other "organizational" 
matters, such as approving the rules of procedure and forming 
committees and commissions, the "Zhirinovites" are also intent 
on voting with the opposition. So, the first objective of the 
RFCP and the Agrarian Party -- "to seize the State Duma's 
organizational structure" -- is likely to be achieved. 
  It is also evident that Zhirinovskiy will disappoint the 
RFCP, which is planning to "abrogate the Constitution," which 
the LDPR has embraced wholeheartedly. The communists may 
expect, however, that their other endeavors will succeed. For 
instance, to all appearances, the LDPR will support the adoption 
of the law on land as it was proposed by the Agrarian Party, 
thus disavowing the famous presidential edict and restricting 
private owners' rights. 
  "Russia's Choice" can hardly count on the successful 
adoption 
of the budget, either. In this particular case the PRES and, 
possibly, some part of "Yabloko" may join Yegor Gaydar's 
hard-line opponents from among the communists and nationalists. 
  Still, all "ill-conceived" State Duma decisions could be 
blocked by the parliament's upper chamber. But there, too, the 
position of "Russia's Choice" is far from perfect -- judging 
from last year's experience, "regional elites," which won a 
majority at the Federation Council, are not very favorably 
disposed toward the federal authorities. The pro-presidential 
forces at the Federation Council, to all appearances, will be 
too preoccupied with reigning in separatism to take on the State 
Duma's majority. All the more so because territorial "elites" 
are inclined to join forces: Former Sverdlovsk Oblast Governor 
Eduard Rossel is already setting up the "Deputies from the 
Urals" organization.

  [Text] Moscow January 4 TASS -- A draft decree "On General 
Political and Economic Amnesty for All Those Convicted Since 
April 15, 1985" is expected to be moved by the Liberal 
Democratic faction at a State Duma session. 
  In the statement dated December 31 but conveyed to TASS only 
today, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's ultranationalist party describes 
its motion as "a new year gift" and expresses hope that this 
decree will be "a step towards consolidation of society". 
  The draft decree also suggests that the trial over the 
August 
1991 pro-communist coup plotters be terminated "for lack of 
corpus delicti", as well as that all people mixed up in the 
October 1993 events on both sides "be relieved from any 
responsibility". 
  The authors of the draft decree propose placing the jailed 
masterminders of the October uprising under home arrest and then 
banning them, as well as some of the August coup leaders, from 
going in for politics for three years.

Valentinovich Malyutin, section chief at the Russian Union of 
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, RUIE, Experts Institute and 
member of the Civil Union Political Council; economist Oleg 
Vladimirovich Grigoryev, department chief at the RUIE Experts 
Institute and cochairman of the Russian Association of Political

Aleksandrovich Yakovenko, cochairman of the Republican Party of 
the Russian Federation; article is published under the rubric 
"Political Kitchen," with introductory note by Feliks Babitskiy: 
"Every Cook Must Learn To Run the State"] 
  [Text] [Babitskiy introduction] "Every Cook Must Learn To 
Run the State" -- the successors of Ilich, who once proclaimed 
this slogan, contrived to turn it into a reality without meaning 
to. Of course, the last thing you could ever accuse the 
Bolsheviks of was wanting to build a civil society. But the 
needs of industrialization forced them to achieve 100-percent 
literacy among the population and to give higher, if not 
classical, education to millions of people. 
  And political awareness is the inevitable offshoot of 
education. So we have the Bolsheviks to thank for that, too! 
  However, once their "political enlightenment" had given us a 
taste for big politics, they were unable to satisfy our 
political appetite. We had to do this ourselves, getting 
together with friends and colleagues in somebody's kitchen. 
Where else, I wonder, would the cook and her children do it? 
  O kitchen! 
  You are the birthplace of all our country's present 
political 
concepts and doctrines. You launched the careers of many stars 
and entire troupes who are now giving shows on the political 
stage. And it does not matter that the relations between them 
are, frankly, more appropriate to the kitchen. What matters is 
that the actors and performers should have a perfect mastery of 
at least the main recipes in political cuisine: all those 
cooked-up facts served up with titillating "plums," all that raw 
meat from the hot spots, stuffed with lead and covered in 
ideological sauce. Of course, the public does not always like 
these details -- it is a matter of taste. But since they are 
feeding it to us anyway, we had better make sure they do not 
foist any really uneatable bad meat on us. 
  That is why, from now on, page two of our newspaper will 
carry articles by the best chefs who prepare dishes for the 
table of the country's president, government, leading 
politicians, and businessmen. Let us hope that with their help 
we will all reach the standard of that legendary cook who is 
supposed to run the state. 
  And irony aside: That standard is what is called a civil 
society. 
  Today we offer for your attention two pieces of research 
work 
carried out specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's analysis service 
by a group of experts. 
  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has exclusive rights to this research. 
  So, welcome to our political kitchen! 
  Yours, 
  Feliks Babitskiy. 
  [Malyutin, Grigoryev, Yakovenko article begins] And All 
This Is About Him 
  About the terrible Zhirinovskiy, from whom, for some reason 
or other, people expect unheard-of villainies and great acts of 
heroism on a Quixotic scale -- and some of them, in a fit of 
"administrative rapture," have even decided to form a front to 
barricade themselves against him. This is totally unwarranted 
-- you only have to remember Zhirinovskiy at the Constitutional 
Conference to see how quiet and God-fearing he can be. He too 
will be a center. Center in every sense, including a center of 
attention, and, with 70 people, a center of decisionmaking. 
Unless, naturally, a centrist majority forms, and finds a common 
language with the government, and that is clearly not going to 
happen for the first few months at least. And if enough acts of 
folly are committed during that time, the Duma in its present 
composition might never succeed at all. 
  Of course, on the strength of its basic principles, 
Zhirinovskiy's party is the typical "power party," in some ways 
downright archetypal, as Grandpa Lenin would have said. But 
unlike the Communists and the national patriots, who based all 
their plans (and still do, sometimes, to this day) on raising 
the masses against the ruling regime and using parliament as a 
platform to kindle the masses' fury, Zhirinovskiy has every 
chance of coming to power legally in the very near future. 
Never in his life has he had any philosophical allergy (whether 
based on communism or on a back-to-the-land philosophy) to using 
general elections, the presidency, and parliamentary democracy 
as tools. Without comparing him to Hitler, we would nonetheless 
like to point out that the Third Reich was a strictly 
rule-of-law state, and its Fuehrer never broke a single law in 
his life (OK, so he wrote the laws himself, but every great man 
has his whims). 
  And so the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], like 
the other groupings (YaBL [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] and the 
PRUA [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] most of all) for whom 
the most important thing is the presidential elections in summer 
1996 (that is the very latest date, they could be earlier), will 
use the Duma (which, moreover, does not decide anything, in the 
sense of exercising power) to "flex their muscles." Shakhray 
and Yavlinskiy will demonstrate to the whole world that "only 
they can stop" Zhirinovskiy, using him as a battering ram. If, 
say, after a while Zhirinovskiy concludes that there is a high 
probability of his losing the elections, he will undoubtedly go 
over to the intransigents and become their leader, but that is 
not how things stand for the time being. He does not really 
need them as a worn-out step up to his pedestal. 
  What we have here is a kind of "negative synthesis" of the 
NSF [National Salvation Front] in content and Democratic Russia 
in form -- and more effective in both cases, thus far. There is 
no need to embark on an analysis of the front's ideology now: 
The predominant force there was "down with!", and any attempts 
to think in terms of "long live!" ran aground on the problems 
faced by "an alliance of cats tied together by their tails." It 
is quite obvious that in September-October the NSF suffered an 
organizational failure, since it was not in control of anything 
and played the part of more or less active "cannon fodder" and 
"cheerleaders" for Khasbulatov and Rutskoy. All in all, there 
were too many petty contenders for the roles of leaders and 
ideologues, none of whom knew how to work with the mass media -- 
nor were they willing to learn.... 
  As for Democratic Russia, it had, generally speaking, the 
same organizational Achilles heel. For this movement of 
brilliant (mainly Moscow-based) individualists, Yeltsin was 
initially "not one of ours." They quite openly decided to take 
him up and make use of him as a battering ram in pursuit of 
their own goals, making no secret of the fact that they could 
drop him if they no longer needed him, and he repaid them in 
kind. Yeltsin very sensibly never claimed to be an original 
thinker. They got into parliament thanks to their own efforts, 
and when, for one reason or another, they were disappointed with 
Yeltsin, they distanced themselves from him, and often gained by 
doing so. It is no accident that virtually nobody from Moscow's 
Democratic Russia has made an even remotely successful 
government career, even after August 1991. 
  Yeltsin, for his part, within his "milieu," always kept the 
radicals at a certain distance, preferring the position of 
"father of the nation." In actual fact Zhirinovskiy likewise -- 
with adjustments for temperament and style -- was never a 
radical in his actions, nor is he an "unbounded" demagogue. As 
long as you do not hang on his every word and judge him by his 
public statements, in actual fact he is rather a cautious 
creature who always has a keen sense of the dividing line 
between what is permitted and what is not, for the moment, 
permitted. Even without him, the Duma will have no shortage of 
radicals, who will inevitably try to "out-Zhirinovskiy" him and, 
in a way, to revive the traditions of the "White" wing of the 
NSF. 
  Zhirinovskiy took "his" list into the Duma himself, on his 
own back: 60 of them, of whom only six are from the electoral 
districts -- a striking contrast! They include practically no 
well-known, outstanding individuals except for A. Kashpirovskiy 
and the ecologist M. Lemeshev, nor are there any really 
independent thinkers with claims to originality -- although the 
presence of the editor of YURIDICHESKAYA GAZETA and a group of 
legal experts and economists formerly linked with the radical 
wing of the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation] 
solves the problem of who will write the draft laws, while at 
the same time giving rise to a certain lack of internal 
homogeneity in the team, where there is already a growing 
dissatisfaction among the "old boyars" with the "new staff of 
smart guys." It will therefore be a very obedient tool, 
especially if the idea of the imperative mandate -- 
propagandized not only by Zhirinovskiy -- catches on and the 
entire faction votes as one man, so that the "lawyer's son" 
could end any parliamentary or extraparliamentary argument with 
the same phrase (like Cato about Carthage): "Apart from all 
that has been said, I must add that Russia's problems will never 
be solved until I am elected president, the sooner the better." 
This phrase will sound all the more weighty given that, with 
the existing structure of the Duma, Zhirinovskiy's faction could 
block any decision by abstaining. Unless the center can come to 
an agreement with either Zyuganov or Gaydar on any given 
question. 
  Meanwhile Vladimir Volfovich will willingly explain to 
whoever wants to listen that he is voting in this way because he 
does not want to get dragged into squabbles between bankrupt 
politickers who are always sharing out power and do not think 
about the people. Against the background of the democrats' 
convulsive attempts to knock together an antifascist front (it 
is not clear that this front is going to do anything except make 
trips abroad: It might hold rallies -- but who is going to 
come?), these tactics will instantly win new supporters. Of 
course, there will be rows too, and on many more occasions our 
hero will have to write the word "traitor" next to the names of 
those who are presently his closest comrades in arms -- for a 
charismatic leader, that is quite normal.... 
  Moreover, the "Zhirinovskiy factor," irrespective of the 
fact 
that everyone has already declared that they will not join a 
coalition with him, will strengthen the intransigent opposition 
of the old stamp. 
  That opposition can now operate as zealously as it likes -- 
because this Duma cannot be disbanded, except, of course, at 
bayonet point. And judging by the vote, the main military 
secret is not how many bayonets, sabers, and other antiquated 
items the former Red Army has, but whom the army is backing 
today. The present Kremlin authorities know very well that 
there can hardly be a repetition of the October onslaught -- a 
miracle is a miracle precisely because it happens only once. 
The intransigents could even blackmail the democrats with the 
threat of self-dissolution by the Duma, because at the moment 
everyone knows who would win the next elections if such were 
held. Obviously not "Russia's Choice," especially since the new 
electoral law (including the Law on Presidential Elections) will 
be adopted, amid heated debates, by this very Duma. And 
Yeltsin's edicts, whether on the timing of the presidential 
elections or on abandoning them, also need ratifying. So there 
you are. 
  Naturally, Zhirinovskiy's future as a politician is by no 
means cloudless, and his success is by no means predetermined, 
just as Yeltsin's political past -- turbulent even by our 
standards, which are far from poor in this respect -- was not 
cloudless. In the opinion of many serious analysts, Yeltsin's 
career, retrospectively, looks like a chain of lucky chances 
which at any moment -- until the evening of 3 October 1993 -- 
turned out ultimately in his favor. But that does not really 
have anything to do with parliament: The LDPR faces questions 
relating to the building of its own political party, the 
coordination of extraparliamentary forms of pressure on the 
regime, work with the Army, foreign policy actions, and much 
else. After all, before the elections it was no more 
substantial than the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia] in this 
respect, that is, it had a few thousand activists and, according 
to expert assessments, its numerical strength was not much in 
excess of 10,000 members, and, other than in the Moscow region, 
it was influential and had a real presence only in the 
Nonchernozem and a few other regions. 
  It is clear that all this will not be decided at the level 
of the parliamentary faction: That faction will give voice to 
the planned strategy and tactics in the public area, which, 
incidentally, is what has always been done throughout the world. 
But since, in this article, we are analyzing not the prospects 
of a certain type of charismatic leader and his "ultramodern 
party" taking power, but the prospects of the new parliament on 
whose stage he will put on his political performances, what has 
been said about the LDPR is sufficient, as a first 
approximation. Zhirinovskiy has received his mandate of 
confidence as the "Yeltsin of today," in an even more provincial 
version. Let us see whether he will be able to take advantage 
of it. 
<H5>  On the Eve of a Choice </H5>
  In its very first hours of work the State Duma will face a 
question whose answer will immediately clarify much. It is a 
kind of archetypal "knight at the crossroads" situation. With 
its "if you turn left...and if you turn right...." This is not 
the question of the government, as many people fear. Ultimately 
Chernomyrdin has quite a good chance of being given confidence, 
although, of course, some unpleasant moments lie in store for 
him when he is forced to answer the question of the possible 
presence of Gaydar, Chubays, Fedorov, and Kozyrev in the 
government. After all, if worst comes to worst, the question of 
the government can be avoided entirely, but the question of 
ratifying Edict 1400 cannot be avoided. Especially since this 
procedure was stipulated by the edict itself and by subsequent 
legislative activity carried out by the president "on credit." 
  The consequences of the ratification or nonratification of 
Edict 1400 are obvious. If the edict is not ratified, the 
entire new political and legal structure collapses. After that, 
while the president will unequivocally be, from the legal 
viewpoint, a "usurper and rebel who carried out a bloody coup 
d'etat," parliament, although it will not have been elected 
entirely legitimately, will still remain the organ of people's 
power. All it has to do is to declare itself, by a simple 
majority, to be the successor not only to the Congress, but also 
to the State Duma and the Constituent Assembly into the bargain, 
and even to the Zemskiy Sobor that used to elect the czars at 
one time. 
  First of all, the new Constitution automatically ceases to 
operate, since the referendum on it was held in violation of the 
Law on the Referendum, which Yeltsin was entitled to do only in 
the event that the edict was ratified. Incidentally, in their 
haste, they omitted to repeal or suspend that law. 
Nonratification of the edict does not necessarily mean the 
automatic reinstatement of the disbanded Congress, but it does 
allow for the possibility of turning the Duma into a Constituent 
Assembly, and here you cannot get away with just another edict 
to the effect that the relevant point of Edict 1400 is invalid 
on the basis of the referendum results (nationwide approval by 
one-third of the electoral register is politically insubstantial 
and has no legal status without ratification by parliament), 
especially since the new Constitution was not adopted in the 
majority of components of the Federation. 
  The situation is made even trickier by the fact that votes 
must be collected not against, but for ratification, and it is 
quite possible to propose the interpretation that since Edict 
1400 is undoubtedly constitutional, it requires a constitutional 
majority (that is, three-fourths), and this cheerfully postpones 
the question until the twelfth of never. There will be people 
in the Duma who will raise this question, but the centrists will 
be very well aware of what prospects face them in this 
connection. Especially since the YaBL bloc has decided to seize 
the initiative and has declared that it will seek the formation 
of a commission for parliamentary investigation of all the 
circumstances relating to the adoption and implementation of 
Edict 1400. It will then be "not just simple, but very simple" 
to postpone its ratification until then and to keep Yeltsin 
personally in their sights. While extracting in exchange, as a 
minimum, a return to June 1994 presidential elections. And then 
it will be possible to create a really broad front, if not 
antifascist (there is no real threat from there at present), 
then an anti-authoritarian front, on the basis of limiting the 
president's powers and returning to a majority system in 
elections. 
  The democratic factions themselves have no way of collecting 
225 votes for the ratification of the edict, especially since 
not everyone in the PRUA or YaBL will vote for it, and the 
"independent" is independent, and it is not at all clear what he 
can be bought for at the moment. Nor is intimidation really 
practicable. Two options remain. Either you buy the votes of 
the centrists, up to and including the agrarians -- but in 
return they will demand the government, nothing less. Or else 
you openly enter into a coalition with Zhirinovskiy, once again 
on the basis of renewed constitutionalism. And even then there 
might not be enough votes. From the viewpoint of his own 
interests, there is no particular reason for Zhirinovskiy to 
"tarnish his bright image" in the eyes of the voter through an 
open alliance with "Russia's Choice." That could lose him 
votes. On this question, it would be better for him to abstain: 
After all, he played absolutely no part in the 
September-October events, and therefore he need not join in 
someone else's fight, he can sit and wait. But the question of 
the ratification of Edict 1400 gives him a unique opportunity to 
demand, as payment, that presidential elections be called for 
June of this year. That step is something that would be very 
well understood by his voters. And not only his.... 
  Whatever the president's team may do, the raising of the 
question of Edict 1400 in the Duma is inevitable. This will be 
voted for both by the centrists, if our analysis is correct and 
there are more serious politicians among them today, and by 
Zhirinovskiy, because power itself is falling into his hands. 
"We will make a deal with the president" -- this man knows what 
he is saying. The reformers had better start thinking now who 
they would prefer to deal with. They have already started: 
Kozyrev observed aloud that the communists were always the 
staunchest fighters against fascism. How far Zyuganov can be 
counted as one of them, and how far it is reasonable to classify 
his party, in its present form, in the tradition of the left, 
and specifically the antifascist tradition, is another matter. 
But the CPRF clearly does not tolerate crooks, and if it is 
going to come to terms, it is only with Chernomyrdin and the 
"pragmatic wing" in general, certainly not with fundamentalist 
ideologists. It has plenty of its own, within the faction. 
Especially since the CPRF has its own favorite complicating 
factor -- a coalition government of people's confidence, and it 
is clearly going to push that most of all. 
  But if the barrier of Edict 1400 can somehow be crossed, the 
problem of the budget and the government will loom large, mainly 
the former, because, whatever Constitution we are to live under 
in future, any parliament is going to have a fairly distant 
connection with the government, but the Duma will allow the 
government to draw up the budget for 1994, so as to be able to 
castigate it later (and Fedorov's head alone might not be 
enough). As for other avenues of development, there is no point 
in talking about them until after this latest fork in the road 
has been traversed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Filatov, Russian President Yeltsin's </F>
chief of staff, by unidentified correspondent; place and date 
not given: "Living According to the Law and Conscience -- 
Sergey Filatov, Specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI"] 
  [Text] [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] It took tremendous 
intellectual and moral efforts by society to take the step to 
the country's new Constitution. Its adoption is a historical 
fact and was a moment of truth. We all must be aware of the 
great strength of the state embodied by the new Constitution. 
It is important that we all sense the vitality of the 
fundamental law, which from the outset must give not the 
slightest grounds for being seen as impotent or purely 
rhetorical. Is there any confidence that the launching of the 
new Constitution into the orbit of the Russian state will rally 
the people and give them faith and hope for change and for the 
instrument of this change? 
  [Filatov] It is precisely confidence in the Constitution's 
timeliness that is today maintaining and imparting confidence to 
many Russian Federation citizens both inside and outside the 
country. 
  The Constitution has cut the knot of the soviets' monopoly 
on 
power in the country, has created substantial legal barriers to 
the possibility of gaining power by violent adventurist means, 
and has created the preconditions for ending the legal chaos. 
On 24 December 1993 the Russian Federation president issued the 
edict "On Measures To Bring Russian Federation Legislation Into 
Line With the Russian Federation Constitution," whereby he laid 
down all the additional powers he was forced to exercise after 
the termination of the Supreme Soviet's activity. Thus 
responsibility for the country's development is de jure now 
placed equally on the executive and legislative branches, in 
conformity with the Constitution. 
  The elaboration of the draft constitution and the holding of 
the nationwide vote was a huge job involving hundreds and 
thousands of people: scientists, specialists, and 
representatives of parties and social movements. All mechanisms 
of democratic principles were used in preparing the 
Constitution. The support for the Constitution by the people is 
visible confirmation that it was prepared not by the powers that 
be but indeed by representatives of all strata of the 
population. While the United States was left with two volumes 
of stenographic reports after the preparation of its 
Constitution, we have been left with an entire multivolume 
series in our archives. The text of the fundamental law was 
studied at the Constitutional Conference, in its chambers, in 
working commissions, and under constitutional arbitration 
procedures. I hope that all the papers will be published and be 
available to any historian. I want to sincerely thank all 
participants in this great and important work! 
  There were many firsts. For the first time a draft 
constitution was submitted to a nationwide vote. For the first 
time the existence of a professional parliament has been 
enshrined in the Constitution. 
  There are many other firsts. This is probably why it is 
proving such a slow and difficult process to build the edifice 
of the new statehood. But it is a poor master who is guided 
solely by the well known principle "Let us raze everything to 
the ground, and then...." Naturally, the new Constitution was 
based on consideration of the relations really existing in 
society and on consideration of the existing real guarantees of 
human rights and freedoms. Therefore it both encapsulated 
society's existing achievements and, most importantly, opened up 
future prospects. 
  With the adoption of the new Constitution one of the 
fundamentally important pledges that the president of Russia 
gave the people has been fulfilled. This was also fresh 
confirmation of people's trust in the presidential course of 
political and economic reform. 
  The nationwide approval of such an important legal document 
represents a credit of trust in the authorities. A sizable 
credit at a considerable rate of interest. So we should not 
rest on our laurels but constantly think about progress every 
day and every hour. It is no accident that the opposition is 
vigorously pushing the thesis that the policies of the 
supporters of democracy and economic reform are ramshackle. 
However, work on the new Constitution demonstrated, first, the 
seriousness and promising nature of our plans and the fact that 
they are thoroughly thought-out and, most importantly, the 
consistency of the transformations in all spheres of Russia's 
social life. In my view, the time of "ultrarevolutionary" 
upheavals must finally recede into the past. We have had enough 
of measuring our lives by the intervals between revolutions. 
People are tired of upheavals, of a feverish economy, and of 
uncertainty about the future. 
  The new Constitution is precisely an instrument we can rely 
on in transforming our society's economy and politics and the 
life of the country as a whole. It clearly delimits the 
competence of legislative and executive organs of power and does 
not permit them to "pressure" each other. It contains a number 
of mechanisms for this. 
  I hope that the start of work by the Federal Assembly will 
show that the new parliament's main task is to create the 
framework of legislation and adopt the laws according to which 
we will live, while the task of the executive organs is to 
ensure that those laws are implemented. But if all of a sudden 
the mechanism for the separation of powers "misfires," the 
mechanism of guarantees -- the president's power -- will come 
into effect. It is the president who is the guarantor of 
observance of the Russian Federation Constitution. Moreover, 
the Constitution in itself, as a law, lays down the basis for 
stability in the country's existence, enabling the world 
community to regard the country as a strong state and reliable 
partner from the political and economic viewpoints. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Nowadays the word "Constitution" is used 
together with the word "new." How are its forms new? It is 
important to grasp this, since some of them were enshrined in 
the old Constitution. 
  [Filatov] The most fundamental element in the Constitution 
is the enshrining of human and civil rights and freedoms. For 
the first time it is on record that the Russian Federation 
recognizes and guarantees rights and freedoms in accordance with 
generally recognized principles and norms of international law. 
The aforementioned rights and freedoms are direct-acting and 
are safeguarded by the judicial system. 
  Both economic rights and citizens' freedoms have been 
clarified. Each citizen is granted the right to engage freely 
in entrepreneurial activity. The question of private ownership 
has been fundamentally resolved. Article 35 says that the right 
of private ownership is protected by law. 
  The entire Constitution is permeated by the idea of 
strengthening our federative state. It clearly defines the 
legal status of components of the Russian Federation and their 
equality among themselves and in relations with the center. I 
need only cite the provision of Article 76 whereby normative 
legal enactments of components of the Russian Federation operate 
in the adoption of federal law on questions not forming part of 
the competence of central organs of state power. 
  It is important to note that the autonomy of components is 
determined not only by the Constitution but also by the 
Federation Treaty and also by their right to conclude other 
treaties on the demarcation of areas of responsibility of their 
powers. [sentence as published] 
  The constitutional regulation of relations between the 
president, the government, and the Federal Assembly is 
important. This nexus is structured on the basis that the 
president of the Russian Federation is the head of state and 
guarantor of the Constitution, human and civil rights and 
freedoms, and the sovereignty, independence, and state integrity 
of the Russian Federation. With the consent of the State Duma 
the president appoints the chairman of the government (if 
parliament rejects three nominations the president has the right 
to appoint the chairman independently, dissolve the Duma, and 
schedule fresh elections), adopts decisions on the dismissal of 
the government, at the proposal of the chairman of the 
government appoints and dismisses his deputies and federal 
ministers, and submits to the Federation Council for appointment 
candidate justices of the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court, 
and Superior Court of Arbitration. According to the procedure 
indicated in the Constitution, he can be removed from office by 
the Federation Council on the basis of a charge of high treason 
or another grave crime submitted by the State Duma. 
  The Constitution creates a new legislative organ -- a 
Federal Assembly consisting of two chambers: the Federation 
Council and the State Duma. The State Duma, which works 
permanently, elaborates and adopts laws, and the Federation 
Council approves these laws. It will not work on laws article 
by article but will assemble periodically and examine what the 
State Duma has done from the viewpoint largely of federal 
interests. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Has the criticism of the Constitution by 
its opponents been taken into account? 
  [Filatov] I must immediately dot the "i's" here. The 
preparation of the draft constitution by the Constitutional 
Conference and its chambers consisted of two important periods. 
During the first all the proposals and comments without 
exception -- and after publication of the draft in May 1993 
there were over 5,000 of them -- were examined and carefully 
studied. During the second stage the country's president 
referred the draft constitution for nationwide approval. 
Russians familiarized themselves with the text of the draft and 
determined their attitude toward the proposed version. During 
this period no changes were made to the draft constitution. A 
telephone information service was created in the Kremlin to 
explain the published text and each day over the course of a 
month it explained the provisions of the draft constitution to 
all callers and provided interpretations of particular articles. 
There were over 3,000 calls during this month. Normal 
productive work was carried out. 
  Meanwhile certain public movements were inflaming the 
situation in the country, fanning hysteria, and deliberately 
misinterpreting the draft's provisions. The "scathing 
criticism" by certain historians, sociologists, and political 
scientists was often based simply on a lack of information about 
the Constitution's contents. But sometimes, unfortunately, some 
of them were carrying out social orders. Incidentally, this was 
all too easy to see when, for instance, politically committed 
jurists began to intimidate Russians with the fatal consequences 
of a thoughtless action. To be honest, it is hard to believe 
that in Russia the people's actions are always thoughtless. The 
themes of the "stupid people" and the "wise leader" are all too 
familiar to many of us. We have experienced this for ourselves, 
so to speak. 
  I have more faith in the Russian people's wisdom, natural 
intelligence, and perspicacity. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] The operation of the Constitution 
extends to all regions, even those which voted against adopting 
it. How will the federal authorities act if those who rejected 
it refuse to live according to it? 
  [Filatov] The Constitution, as an integral entity, can be 
regarded only as a united and interconnected package of rights 
and responsibility for the implementation of these guaranteed 
rights. The fundamental law cannot be implemented selectively -- 
I choose to implement this bit but I refuse to implement this 
bit. The strength of the Constitution lies in the unity and 
interconnection of rights and duties. Only then does the 
mechanism of guarantees on the part of the state begin to 
operate. 
  The text of the Constitution begins with the words "We, the 
multinational people of the Russian Federation." This does not 
merely sound solemn, there is far more substance here than 
solemnity. It is the people, the entire people, not some 
section of them, that have adopted new rules for the country's 
life. We the people take on all the problems, we the people 
take on all the difficulty of making tricky decisions, we the 
people really become responsible for our future and the future 
of new generations. 
  There is only one solution for contentious issues -- calm, 
considered, reasoned, and professionally competent examination 
of contentious issues in the Constitutional Court. In fact, 
this is the reason why the judicial branch exists. It is called 
upon to harmonize interests and to see that law triumphs over 
the unruly wishes of each individual. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] Now for some questions about what the 
new Constitution brings for ordinary people. For instance, 
Article 2 asserts that the state undertakes the obligation of 
recognizing and observing human and civil rights and freedoms. 
Moreover, Article 18 says that rights and freedoms are 
direct-acting. How does this work in practice? 
  [Filatov] An unquestioned achievement of the new 
Constitution is the fact that it is direct-acting, that is, the 
norms enshrined in it cannot be "adjusted" for the worse by 
subsequent laws. Take Article 18, for instance. It states that 
human and civil rights and freedoms are direct-acting. This is 
not merely instructions to the Federal Assembly, the president, 
and the government to adopt their enactments within the 
framework of the Constitution's provisions. This statement is 
the legal basis for the defense of human rights via the courts. 
And it would be a question of a direct violation of the 
Constitution, not merely of some legal provision. As you can 
see, the state's legal guarantees are of a very different, 
higher level. 
  We are steadily moving forward and developing society's 
legal culture. As you can see, the process is not only complex 
but, most importantly, affects all society and requires a 
totally different type of relationship between the citizen and 
the state. We are still not used to this kind of 
interdependence. But we will have to get used to it. 
  [ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI] The Constitution apparently creates 
colossal scope for implementing human rights. But how will the 
fulfillment of these rights be guaranteed? For instance, one of 
the Constitution's norms proclaims the individual's right to 
travel freely and choose his place of stay and residence. 
  How is this norm going to enter into effect? After all, it 
is well known that the institution of residence permits still 
exists and, moreover, special procedures for the registration of 
visiting citizens have been introduced for Moscow and St. 
Petersburg. Won't this norm come into conflict with other human 
rights? 
  Or to take another example, Article 21 says that the dignity 
of the individual is protected by the state and nothing may be 
grounds for disparaging it. But today our dignity is disparaged 
at virtually every step: in dirty stores, on poorly maintained 
streets, in the subway and streetcars, in social security and 
housing offices.... It is hard to imagine that this norm will 
begin to operate.... 
  Is there any need, in our [as published] view, for the 
president and government to take special measures to ensure that 
the Constitution begins to operate right from the outset? 
  [Filatov] Unfortunately, your questions are typical of our 
legal awareness. Or, to be more accurate, of the legal 
awareness of yesterday's Soviet person. 
  I know it is not so easy to become a Russian citizen, 
someone 
for whom democratic norms must be customary and natural. The 
main difficulty in the way of our "legal maturity" is to 
overcome the echoes of yesterday's ideas molded by Soviet 
reality. Paternalism -- the belief in the all-powerfulness of 
the state and the expectation of often totally unjustified and 
unrealistic favors from it -- has thoroughly corrupted us. It 
is like in a family where the parents alone bear the entire 
burden of problems, the children usually lack willpower and are 
weak. 
  Judge for yourselves. Even since the nationwide referendum 
approving the new Constitution we have been living in a world of 
illusory expectation that someone -- the president or the 
government -- will come along and the dirt in stores and the 
subway will vanish while social security offices will begin to 
dote on pensioners and veterans. I think that there is all too 
much simple passive and lazy waiting for the same old favors in 
this attitude. Nothing comes along or happens automatically. 
That truth is as banal as it is real and vital. 
  I reiterate the thought that the Constitution is a contract 
for us all and a code of basic rules of life that will make our 
society richer and more free. But not automatically, without 
our doing anything, but precisely thanks to us, thanks to our 
labor! 
  As I conclude, I would like to draw your attention to the 
fact that, despite all the problems, it is New Year. So let us 
forget all our problems for a moment and feel light and relief 
in our hearts. Let the mood be good in the new year, may 
children and grandchildren bring joy to our homes, and let us 
learn to live in peace and harmony! Happy New Year to everyone, 
I wish you new happiness!

<F P=106> [Interview with First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar by Yelena </F>
Vishnevskaya in the "Forecast" column; place and date not given: 
"What Gaydar Can Be Blamed For"] 
  [Text] [Vishnevskaya] What is awaiting Russia and the 
Russians in the new year? I put this question to First Vice 
Premier Yegor Gaydar on the eve of the holiday. Now I can see 
that his answers will not please everybody. Therefore you will 
have to decide yourselves for what to blame Gaydar. 
  First all of, I would like to know which course the reforms 
may take: "onward" or "backward"? And which actions by the 
authorities can indicate to us, the philistines, a landmark.... 
I was asking Yegor Timurovich about his forecasts for the 
future in the sphere of economics but, to be sure, in responding 
to them, he could not do without politics. 
  [Gaydar] It is an unrewarding business to make predictions. 
Especially since the situation in economics and in politics this 
new year will depend not so much on the auspiciousness of the 
stars as on the conclusions drawn from the events of the 
outgoing year. I can say one thing with certainty, though: The 
Russians will be scolding the authorities. 
  [Vishnevskaya] This is what authority is for -- to criticize 
it. This is so natural! In any country, let alone ours, with 
so many outstanding problems.... 
  [Gaydar] The whole point is for what they are blamed. If 
for the fact that although there are goods in the shops, the 
shop windows and shelves are still a far cry not only from those 
in Brussels but even in Warsaw.... And prices keep growing, 
although at a slower pace than just recently. But they keep 
growing anyway! And the fact that production has to be 
restructured and that it has become difficult to market goods 
owing to competition and even to reduce personnel, which is 
especially painful and hard, and that those dismissed cannot 
find a job in their speciality -- if this is what they blame it 
for, let them. This is like a sobering cold shower -- not to 
slacken. But if it is blamed for the fact that some goods are 
not available at any price while those that do appear on the 
shelves are so expensive that they are beyond reach, that money 
again is losing value, that the ruble is depreciating with every 
passing day, that savings can be kept only in hard currency, but 
this is impossible because its cash circulation has been banned, 
that the producers and the consumers are deeply in debt to each 
other.... well, then, here things are bound to go beyond mere 
grumbling. 
  [Vishnevskaya] The latter scenario is too familiar: It is 
reminiscent of 1992. Again the same old story? Is this 
possible? 
  [Gaydar] Alas, if we get frightened once again and, instead 
of continuing a tough policy but the only feasible economic one, 
begin to pump the country with money, then inflation will 
accelerate in spring, leading to nonpayments, a budget crisis, 
and then an economic crisis. And whereas last year the 
fluctuations in economic policy were if not justified then at 
least explicable, this year they are fraught with catastrophe 
and are definitely not inevitable. 
  [Vishnevskaya] But possible? There are prerequisites for 
that. The present parliament differs little from the previous 
one. It seems that two months ago you said that you were 
haunted by a terrible dream: You enter the State Duma and what 
you see is the Supreme Soviet.... Has the nightmare become a 
reality? 
  [Gaydar] Well, the situation surely cannot be called satin 
smooth [barkhatnaya]. Yet I have never worked in a satin smooth 
situation.... As for today's situation, it is radically 
different from that in September. At that time there was a 
severe conflict between the parliament and the government, with 
the president's edicts being immediately countermanded and with 
a complete power vacuum in the regions while decisions made at 
the center by one power branch were blocked at the local level 
by another branch; there was no budget for the fourth quarter. 
Things were heading toward a political crisis. 
  [Vishnevskaya] And did come to it. 
  [Gaydar] But now the situation is different! There is the 
main thing -- the constitution, and within its framework, 
separation of powers. There is a strong presidency. And the 
parliament, too, is different. We have the largest faction in 
it, which, including the presidential power of veto, can block 
most irresponsible decisions. 
  [Vishnevskaya] And what if it cannot? The faction is large, 
all right, but Russia's Choice is not a parliamentary majority. 
The government, too, after the elections, has acquired a 
coalition character, which is obvious to all. Is normal work 
possible in such conditions without infighting and confrontation? 
  [Gaydar] Our disagreements are largely exaggerated. Of 
course, they are there but they relate to "superficial" matters 
and, moreover, are easily removed. For instance, the Yabloko 
bloc believes that the main shortcoming in government 
performance is its weak antimonopoly policy. Who would disagree 
with that?! Are there any ideas on strengthening it? Are there 
people to translate these ideas into life? You are most welcome 
into the government to implement them! Naturally, we shall not 
be demanding that anyone either recognize the flawlessness of 
our policy or publicly renounce their own views. 
  [Vishnevskaya] Does this mean that the road into the 
executive branch is open to all regardless of political 
persuasions? 
  [Gaydar] To all who can and want to work in it, implementing 
its program. I am categorically against people opposed to the 
program joining it -- no, not the program of Russia's Choice but 
of the government. Their place is in parliament where they can 
argue, promote their ideas, and in the end exercise control. 
  [Vishnevskaya] And what if such "promoters" are in the 
majority within the government? 
  [Gaydar] This would mean a change of course. Then the 
Russia's Choice faction will have to decide on the expediency of 
some of its members working in it. But I do not think that 
things will come to that. In any event, we are not making any 
ultimatums or conditions. 
  [Vishnevskaya] But the policy of the present government is 
also far from ideal. For instance, you are being criticized for 
artificially maintaining the ruble rate against the dollar. 
  [Gaydar] This is from the "what they blame us for" series of 
questions. So far the ruble is not overrated: In its 
purchasing power the ruble approximates 30 cents. This is how 
it should be in an economy at our level of development. 
Questions arise for a different reason. In 1992, when the rate 
was strongly devalued, it appeared profitable to take any raw 
materials out of the country at any price, an opportunity used 
by many. We were criticized for that (and quite justly, too!). 
Today it is not beneficial to "dump" Russian raw materials on 
the world market at throwaway prices, and we are being 
admonished for that. And it is good that we are! There is no 
such task as to take the resources out of the country: You can 
trade in what yields a profit. 
  [Vishnevskaya] This means that the ruble rate is downgraded, 
although it is realistic. At what level are you going to 
maintain it? 
  [Gaydar] We shall try to make sure that its growth proceeds 
at half the rate of inflation. 
  [Vishnevskaya] Incidentally, inflation in December is 
expected at a level of 12 percent. This, however, does not 
include the last week of the year, which can change the entire 
picture. Is this a result of government policy? 
  [Gaydar] It certainly is. Please note that in December 
there were payments to pensioners, and the "Vorkuta" problem was 
resolved. Overall, during the year the inflation growth rate has 
more than halved. If we go on like this -- and we set the 
target of bringing it down to 5 percent by the end of 1994 -- 
the main thing will be accomplished: It will become profitable 
to invest in production. Combined with tax breaks for producers, 
this constitutes a foundation for industrial revival in 1995. 
  [Vishnevskaya] A rosy prospect, although a very remote one. 
And what kind of "new life" will begin at the start of the new 
year? Prices will jump, of course.... 
  [Gaydar] Only to the extent to which we shall not be able to 
restrain inflation. As for imports, the new year is no 
threshold here. New import duties have been postponed until 
March. Moreover, they will not bring about any revolution in 
prices. 
  [Vishnevskaya] What will they be like? There are various 
rumors to that effect. 
  [Gaydar] They will be various, exactly. High for luxury 
goods and low for staples. The basic principle is that import 
duties should bring revenues to the state treasury and protect 
domestic producers. That they must be introduced, all 
government members are sure. 
  [Vishnevskaya] Why then not as of 1 January? 
  [Gaydar] The level of duties is a matter of dispute, mainly 
for agricultural produce. Our agro-industrial departments 
represented in the government by Aleksandr Zaveryukha are 
insisting on a "prohibitive" level of duties to discourage the 
import of foodstuffs. Others maintain that they should be made 
normal, not protecting Russian producers from competition but 
stimulating it. 
  [Vishnevskaya] And how will this dispute affect prices in 
the shops? 
  [Gaydar] High import duties mean a jump in prices not only 
for foreign goods, which may not be so terrible after all. But 
also increases in domestic prices: Moscow sausages will be 
competing not with Dutch sausages but with Orel sausages, whose 
prime cost is no lower. 
  [Vishnevskaya] But Muscovites are buying for the most part 
on another market: It is enough to go to the Kievskiy or the 
Belorusskiy railway terminal. 
  [Gaydar] Duties have nothing to do with this! Incidentally, 
there are no duties on the output by the main agricultural 
exporters to Russia -- the majority of our former Union 
republics. While we were being criticized for lacking a 
position on relations with the CIS states, we concluded free 
trade agreements with them. Therefore prohibitive tariffs on 
food imports from there have been blocked by a system of 
interstate agreements. 
  [Vishnevskaya] And one final question: With what feeling 
did First Vice Premier Yegor Gaydar see out the year 1993, which 
has been so rich in events? 
  [Gaydar] I have found myself is a rather funny situation. I 
worked in the government in 1993 for slightly more than a 
quarter of a year, since 20 September, and by the moment the 
election campaign got under way, it appeared that the "Gaydar 
team" was responsible for everything. Those who were there for 
the whole year got away with impunity, as it were. We became 
the only ones who did not reject criticisms and complaints. As 
a result, we had the unpleasant duty of responding without the 
pleasant comfort of making decisions, administering, and being 
in control. I have drawn a lesson from this situation: One 
must never create the illusion of responsibility for decisions 
made as part of a political line which is pursued not by you and 
not in the way you think is reasonable.

  [Text] Aleksey Kazannik regards the preservation of the 
procuracy system as his main contribution in the post of 
Russia's general procurator. Summing up the results of his work 
in 1993, in an interview to INTERFAX, he stressed that he sees 
in this one of the guarantees for the unity and integrity of 
Russia. Kazannik also said that the General Procuracy has 
dismissed all cases involving charges of economic crimes which 
were instigated for political reasons so as to compromise 
political figures. 
  Touching on his predecessor Valentin Stepankov, the general 
procurator told journalists that on 24 December he signed an 
edict sacking him from the bodies of the procuracy. After his 
resignation, Stepankov was offered various fields of work, 
including the post of trade counsellor at the Russian Embassy in 
Malta. 
  Aleksey Kazannik also said that criminal proceedings on 
charges of corruption are soon to be instituted against Viktor 
Barannikov and Andrey Dunayev. 
  In conclusion Russia's general procurator gave the assurance 
that he will not allow the examination of the case concerning 
the Moscow events of early October 1993 to be spun out over a 
long period.

<F P=106> [Artem Emilyev report: "Mosaic Portrait of Yavlinskiy"] </F>
  [Text] To what extent are you familiar with G. 
Yavlinskiy's activity? -- a questionnaire from the All-Russia 
Center for the Study of Public Opinion enquires. One of the 
most widespread replies (34 percent) is: "I have some idea of 
him from newspapers and from television interviews." An equal 
number of those polled say that they know of Yavlinskiy only by 
hearsay, while approximately 23 percent claim not to be familiar 
with his name (what radio-less backwoods did they helicopter in 
the questionnaire leaflets to?). Five percent, however, have a 
good idea of Yavlinskiy's person, being familiar with his works 
and his political platform, and a further 4 percent know of the 
results of his activity in his state post. It is out of such 
motley fragments that Yavlinskiy's portrait takes shape. 
Although the smalt from which this mosaic portrait is made is 
of varying brilliance and quality, recently it has been 
attracting attention increasingly frequently. What is it that 
makes us stop stop to look at it in the midst of a busy 
schedule? Precisely 28 percent of those polled acknowledge 
Yavlinskiy's high level of education and intellect, 10 percent 
perceive boldness in his activity, 9 percent value his 
principledness, and the same percentage value his ability to 
talk with people (incidentally, 6 percent of those questioned 
believe that he expounds his thoughts in too complex a manner 
and that it is difficult for an untrained person to understand 
him). Yavlinskiy's positive image is supplemented by the 5 
percent who emphasized his political wisdom, 4 percent noted as 
a virtue the fact that he is a practical person and an active 
politician, and 7 percent have felt his personal charm. 
  But the portrait would be flat if it were without shadows: 3 
percent of those who participated in creating the mosaic noticed 
in their model a political opportunism and even 
unscrupulousness, 2 percent noticed a superficiality, and 9 
percent rebuke Yavlinskiy with being a pure theoretician and 
armchair scientist. 
  And yet these dark stains do not overshadow the bright 
aspects in the image of the person sitting for his portrait. 
Proof of this is provided by the reply to an intriguing 
question in the questionnaire: If Yeltsin does not declare his 
candidacy in the presidential election and you have to choose 
between Yegor Gaydar and Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, for example, for 
whom would you cast your vote? It turned out that 25 percent 
would prefer Yavlinskiy and 19 percent Gaydar. If there were a 
similar confrontation with Aleksandr Rutskoy, in the 
respondents' opinion Yavlinskiy would achieve a still more 
convincing victory (32 percent against 18 percent). One of the 
reasons for this success is that, according to 16 percent, he 
expresses the interests of the widest sections of the 
population. It is curious that 1 percent of those who replied 
to the questionnaire perceived Yavlinskiy as a stooge of the 
West, 2 percent, conversely, as a supporter of "the regime" and 
a champion of Great Russia, while a similar percentage consider 
him altogether a supporter of "socialism with a human face." 
But the majority (21 percent) agree that Yavlinskiy advocates 
democratic reforms but has serious disagreements with Yeltsin 
and the present government. In these disagreements the 
respondents frequently prefer Yavlinskiy. In the list of 
statesmen who hypothetically could improve the situation in our 
economy the majority (22 percent) prefer him, 17 percent prefer 
Gaydar, 7 percent Yeltsin, and 5 percent Shakhray. In this same 
category first place is allocated to Yavlinskiy when it is a 
question of the ability to ensure compliance with social justice. 
  On looking at this portrait, the assembled people started 
sharing their impressions. The most enthusiastic (6 percent) 
said: "I would like him to become president." Cautious people 
(18 percent) put them right: "I believe that he should hold 
some other high state post." Others (19 percent) noted 
categorically: "He should work in the government or parliament, 
but under the leadership of a more influential politician." 
Others (35 percent) spoke out altogether definitely: "It is 
hard to say, as he has not yet shown his worth." Will there be 
any other opinions?

<F P=106> [INFORM-KURANTY report: "Brainstorming in the Kremlin"] </F>
  [Text] A certain shakeup in the top spheres of the 
Kremlin's "gray matter" has begun whose aim is allegedly to 
bring together intellectual pro-presidential forces into a 
single fist in the shape of a major analytical center. The 
well-known results of the recent parliamentary elections having 
been noted, a whole company of official presidential advisers -- 
recruited at one time or another more on the nomenklatura basis 
-- were given their marching orders in the Kremlin, and now they 
have started uniting the ranks of presidential experts. 
  Knowledgeable people believe that some analytical structure 
is taking shape within the president's staff. It will be tasked 
with refining the strategic political line, and elaborating a 
course for the future development of which the head of state is 
responsible under the new constitution. The sphere of interests 
of the new super-center will include strategic problems of both 
foreign and domestic policy.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Sokovnin: "Main Guideline"] </F>
  [Text] Russia 1994. The Strategy of Security. A special 
report by scientific center leaders and experts on this vitally 
important topic has been published in a special issue of the 
RAU-corporation's information and analytical weekly OBOZREVATEL. 
This report will be issued to all State Duma and Federation 
Council deputies since it is intended primarily for people who 
make political decisions or take part in their preparation. 
  The new Federal Assembly has to begin work at a dramatic and 
crucial period in Russia's history. The country's fate in 
forthcoming years will depend largely on the present-day 
decisions of the legislative and executive organs of power. 
  Will the present crisis be overcome or not -- that is the 
question. Suffice it to say that the year of 1992 went down in 
Russia's history with an extremely alarming outcome. For the 
first time in peace time the death rate exceeded the birth rate. 
Over the first nine months of 1993 the situation deteriorated 
still further -- the death rate exceeded the birth rate by 0.5 
million. That means that there is a real threat to the existence 
and survival of the nation itself. 
  Today we must assess soberly and without prejudice the 
situation in which the country has found itself and ascertain 
the reasons which have led to such a tragic development of 
events. 
  The authors of the report believe that it is essential to 
renounce an excessively ideological assessment of events and the 
traditional habit of forcing these assessments to fit the 
short-term goals and aims of particular political parties. 
Before it is too late the interests of the people and the 
country as a whole must be put foremost -- not verbally, as has 
been the case before, but in practical actions. 
  The main principle of state policy in our day is less 
ideology, and more science, pragmatism, and national consensus. 
Otherwise, with the present split, it is impossible to 
elaborate a correct and effective policy for effecting 
transformations to society and the economy. This approach is 
especially important in ensuring the Russian state's security. 
  Above all, the report's authors believe, we must clearly 
determine Russian national interests and the priorities which 
accord both with the interests of individual citizens and of 
society as a whole and among these put foremost those on which 
the existence of the state itself depends. On this basis 
scientists propose to elaborate a program of reforms in the 
interests of all society as a whole, and not of individual 
strata of society. 
  A program which is of a national nature, a realistic, 
pragmatic program free of any form of dominant ideology -- that 
is what our country is in extreme need of today. The authors of 
the analytical report about Russia's future rightly emphasize 
that the Fatherland's citizens have the right to know and are 
even obliged to know the nature of the latest "bright horizons" 
which are being offered to them, the way in which reforms will 
be conducted, and how much time they will take. Citizens have 
the right not only to question but also to completely disagree 
with a proposed program and ultimately to demand a report on the 
government's activity. 
  As the recent elections showed, the country needs a 
government which can find a way out of the crisis. All 
democratic forces interested in Russia's conservation and 
prosperity are called on to unite on this government's 
nationwide platform. 
  For this scientists propose not so much an economic as a 
comprehensive program of actions. Russia's national security 
strategy in 1994 should include, first, the renunciation of the 
extremes of the political struggle and the consolidation of 
legality and law and order, second, a fruitful struggle for 
Russia's economic, financial, and political independence, third, 
a series of effective measures, not propaganda measures, to 
improve the living conditions of Russia's citizens and above all 
of the least protected of them -- pensioners, the sick, 
children, and the disabled -- and, fourth, the resurrection of 
Russia's spiritual potential. The report offers a detailed 
analysis and a package of measures for all these avenues.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS analyst Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow January 4 TASS -- "There is no single centre 
of organised crime in Russia. However, there have been attempts 
by criminal rings to coordinate their illegal activities in the 
regions. And these attempts have not always been unsuccessful," 
First Deputy Interior Minister of Russia Colonel-General Mikhail 
Yegorov said in his opening report on "business and crime in 
Russia," delivered to a three-day international seminar "for 
honest business," which opened at the Russian Management Academy 
here today. The seminar is being attended by economists, law 
scholars, bankers, and heads of commercial structures from 
practically all the CIS countries. 
  General Yegorov noted that organised crime today controlled 
about 40,000 commercial and state enterprises and organisations. 
Capital, earned in recent years, is being multiplied mainly by 
means of illegal financial transactions involving forged advice 
notes, automobile trade, drug-trafficking and trade in armaments. 
  The struggle for spheres of influence among various criminal 
gangs is continuing unabated. According to Yegorov, from 600 to 
700 cases of racketeering, from 10 to 15 cases of 
hostage-taking, and from 30 to 35 armed clashes between gangs 
are now being registered every month. 
  Yegorov noted that the professionalism of criminals had 
increased. This is borne out by the recent assassinations of 
prominent bankers and businessmen. 
  The deputy minister urged businessmen to stop doubting the 
efficiency of law enforcement bodies. He stressed, in 
particular, that "full-blooded" units to combat organised crime 
were formed in all the regions of the country, and that they 
were prepared to react promptly and effectively to any extreme 
situation. "To ensure honest business, we are able to take upon 
ourselves the tasks of guarding commercial buildings, 
transporting valuables and other cargoes, installing alarm 
systems, which will bring our men to the spot within a few 
minutes. We need common tactics to coordinate the actions of 
private security services and official law enforcement bodies," 
Yegorov stated.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Burbyga report: "Another Program Created in Fight </F>
Against Crime. But Will Life Become Safer?"] 
  [Text] The Security Council Interdepartmental Commission 
for Combatting Crime and Corruption has elaborated a federal 
program to combat this evil. It will be presented for the 
scrutiny of the Security Council in the near future. 
  In an exclusive interview with your IZVESTIYA correspondent, 
Major General of Justice Anatoliy Korotkov, leader of a Russian 
Federation Security Council Interdepartmental Commission for 
Combating Crime and Corruption working group, reported that 
whereas previously the fight against crime has been conducted in 
an uncoordinated manner by different departments, now the first 
attempt has been made to coordinate all these efforts and to 
resolve at state level the problem of protecting the life and 
health of Russian citizens. 
  But how is it planned to combat crime -- whose scale and 
pace 
are increasing almost daily? 
  In Korotkov's opinion, reorganization will be necessary in 
the spheres of both legislation and organization. It is planned 
to direct all law enforcement activities toward protecting the 
rights of the individual. Today, for example, if your car is 
stolen, in practice nobody bears responsibility for this. But 
now, according to the new program, it will not only be the thief 
who is responsible for the theft but also the staffers of the 
law enforcement agency on whose territory the theft took place 
and who were unable to guarantee the automobile's safety. 
  Today, he says, we have for the first time come up against a 
new type of crime -- contract killing. In developed capitalist 
countries it is not ordinary policemen who fight hired killers 
but specially trained professionals. But here it is basically 
precinct cops who fight hired killers. We have proved 
unprepared both morally and legislatively for the struggle 
against this new type of crime. Hence the low rate of 
detection. The new program pays much attention to this new type 
of crime and envisages the creation of a special antiterrorist 
center.

<F P=106> [Sergey Knyazkov report followed by editorial afterword: </F>
"Will IZVESTIYA, PRAVDA, and KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Come Out as Always 
in Morning Without Holdups?"] 
  [Text] No, the question posed in the headline is by no 
means rhetorical, as it seems at first glance, because Decree 
No. 1233 "On the Reevaluation of Fixed Capital at Enterprises in 
the National Economy," adopted by the Russian Government 25 
November 1993, came into force 1 January. Effectively this 
decree suspends the publication of all newspapers and journals, 
since the 25-30-percent increase in the value of printing 
enterprises' fixed capital is leading to approximately a 
500-percent increase in prices for printing services! This 
cannot be borne either by a single publishing house, even the 
most prosperous one, or the reader, who has already paid 
newspaper and journal subscriptions and at excessively high 
prices. 
  Alas, however hard this is to come to terms with, yet 
another 
cruel blow is being aimed at the press, glasnost, freedom of 
speech, and what are virtually Russian democracy's most 
significant achievements. Each time it follows the peak of the 
latest political action, in this case the Federal Assembly 
elections. It is even somehow embarrassing to recall the 
government's repeated promises to sort out the questions 
relating to prices for printed publications, mail service chaos, 
and customs barriers hindering newspaper and journal 
distribution. The promise to privatize printing bases with the 
participation of journalists was simply not kept.... 
  Concerned by the situation that has developed, on 30 
December 
leaders of the Union of Journalists of Russia, the Union of 
Journalists of Moscow, the Association of Publishers and Chief 
Editors, the Committee To Protect Freedom of Speech and 
Journalists' Rights, and the Foundation for the Protection of 
Glasnost, as well as the chief editors of almost all central and 
leading Moscow newspapers, delivered a statement to Russian 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. 
  The appeal suggests avoiding this blow against freedom of 
speech either by means of targeted subsidies or by establishing 
a special procedure for implementing this decree in the spheres 
of printing, mail, communications, and paper production. 
Otherwise, the appeal says, "we will have no option but to 
appeal to readers and to the people, urging and asking them to 
defend their newspapers and journals, their right to be 
well-informed on matters of state, society, and the world.... 
Finally, our journalists' collectives will simply have to stop 
work, and this means that both print shops and publishing houses 
will be idle. We state that we are prepared to suspend the 
publication of our publications as early as in the 
'parliamentary week' -- from 10 through 17 January 1994." 
  The journalists are not joking. Yesterday at a press 
conference in which leaders of the Union of Journalists of 
Russia, the Union of Journalists of Moscow, the chief editors of 
KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 
VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA, and MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI, IZVESTIYA's deputy 
chief editor, and others took part, the formation of a strike 
committee by Moscow newspapers was announced. 
  The government has virtually ignored the appeal. Although, 
for the sake of objectivity it must be admitted that when the 
conference was drawing to an end a possible 5 January meeting 
between Russian Federation Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
and members of the Association of Publishers and Chief Editors 
was announced, citing Boris Mironov, acting chairman of the 
Russian Federation Committee for the Press.... 
  Vsevolod Bogdanov, chairman of the Union of Journalists of 
Russia, stressed that the impending action is a forced measure. 
According to him the final decision whether to carry out the 
protest action will be made 5 January. [Knyazkov ends] 
  The following natural question is probably being asked by 
readers: How do KRASNAYA ZVEZDA staffers react to their 
colleagues' statements and actions? What will they do if other 
publishing houses' publications are suspended? 
  KRASNAYA ZVEZDA is a newspaper with special status, a 
military newspaper. Most of its journalists wear shoulder 
boards. A strike, the suspension of publishing, which to our 
civilian colleagues are a legal if extreme form of protest, 
would be a grave violation of the law to us. We cannot fail to 
take into account that in the current conditions the central 
military newspaper is often the most important or else the only 
source of information for many Army and Navy garrisons and 
units, including remote ones. 
  At the same time KRASNAYA ZVEZDA workers are, of course, in 
solidarity with the protest action by Russian publications' 
journalists. Everything they are protesting -- the monopolists' 
price diktat, the destruction of the press distribution system, 
the state mail service's disgraceful work, the creation of 
artificial customs and currency barriers hindering a newspaper's 
contact with its readers -- all this is very familiar indeed to 
us too, we are constantly experiencing all this for ourselves. 
The government's latest act in reevaluating fixed assets is 
hitting KRASNAYA ZVEZDA hard too. 
  We add our voice to that of our colleagues and urge that 
measures be urgently taken to create acceptable conditions in 
which the newspaper market and the distribution system can 
function. The survival of the press is now at stake.
